HEADLINE: G.I.'s on the Road From Kuwait to Baghdad Still Run a Gantlet of Danger

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

DATELINE: BAQUBA, Iraq, March 8 

 BODY:
Alert for homemade bombs, mortar attacks and highway robbery, troops from the First Infantry division rolled into their new base here early Monday after 34-hour convoys from Kuwait that provided a grueling primer on the threats facing American forces rotating into Iraq.
 The dangers varied along the 493-mile route. In the south, from Safwan toward Nasiriya, the biggest threat was bandits, military intelligence officers warned.
 Then, outside Baghdad, two improvised explosive devices were reported along their route, one ahead of a convoy of the division's Third Brigade headquarters team and one just behind, both late Sunday. 
 ''The enemy has now discovered our convoys are on the move,'' said Col. Dana J. H. Pittard, the Third Brigade commander. ''We can't hide.''
 Colonel Pittard chose to make the journey with a logistics convoy -- the one the brigade's officers declared the most inviting target.
 ''We don't have a lot of firepower,'' said Lt. Col. Dan Mitchell, commander of the 201st Forward Support Battalion. ''Our vehicles are soft-skinned. We are slow. We have fuel tankers. We have trucks with food and medical supplies. If you're a terrorist, a logistics convoy would look vulnerable.''
 Leaving the northern Kuwait transit base that was their dusty home for three weeks, the troops crossed the same berm into Iraq breached by the long line of armor that opened the ground war against Saddam Hussein almost a year ago.
 Their first challenge was gangs of thieves, who place boulders in the road to halt convoys while children run in and rifle the trucks. In this poor region, the gangs apparently feel that the chance to snatch even a few hundred dollars worth of American military supplies is worth the risk. The gangs are no physical threat to troops, but the delays they cause could open the troops to sniper attack.
 An effort by arriving Marine Corps troops to halt the robberies caused some consternation over the weekend for the arriving troops.
 Arriving Army drivers and security teams were told that the marines had hired local security guards to patrol the routes. The guards were licensed to carry AK-47's and favor white pickup trucks -- but that also fits the description given to incoming convoys of insurgents conducting attacks along the route. There were no incidents along the southern roads this weekend, though.
 As convoys moved northward, the soldiers trained their heavy, turret-mounted machine guns on highway overpasses favored by snipers. Roadside berms recently used by guerrillas for firing positions were marked on maps, and industrial towers were scanned for scouts, who might alert ambush squads further along the route.
 Then, not long before the convoys passed through an area marked on Army maps as a region of ''extreme danger'' -- between Baghdad and Falluja -- there were reports that the two explosive devices had been found.
 Convoy commanders had been warned that insurgents might plant fake explosives to draw demolition teams into ambushes or set a series of bombs to detonate in sequence.
 Although heavily armed Army strike teams were scattered throughout the logistics convoy, individual soldiers took their own precautions.
 Drivers welded antishrapnel collars onto the hoods of their trucks, to deflect exploding debris while maintaining visibility. Sandbags were laid on the floors of Humvees, trimming the skimpy legroom from economy class to steerage.
 Before leaving Kuwait, crews went to metal shops at the transit bases, to get makeshift steel doors for the journey for their otherwise unarmored Humvees and trucks. 
 When the soldiers arrived at Camp Warhorse late Sunday and toward dawn on Monday, they found their new home operating in total blackout, for security reasons. The camp, on the outskirts of this volatile city northeast of Baghdad, is the occupation base most often hit by mortars.
 Insurgents were not the only threat on the 34-hour journey. Temperatures reached 102 degrees inside open Humvees. There were midnight dust storms, two-hour waits at fueling stops, broken axles and bumper-to-bumper military traffic on jarringly primitive roads through hostile territory.
 ''I'm glad I don't have to do this trip for a while,'' said Sgt. Travis Snook, who drove a Humvee.
 For Sergeant Snook and the 3,000 members of the First Infantry's Third Brigade, that return trip is not scheduled for 12 months.

HEADLINE: Medicare Nominee Backs Drug Imports

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 8 

 BODY:
President Bush's nominee to run Medicare and Medicaid, Dr. Mark B. McClellan, said Monday that he would work with Congress on bipartisan legislation to assure the safety of prescription drugs imported from Canada.
 The way to do that is by giving the Food and Drug Administration more money, more personnel and more power to police imports, Dr. McClellan said at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee. 
 ''I absolutely am committed to doing that,'' so Americans can safely import lower-cost medicines, he said. 
 As commissioner of food and drugs for the last 16 months, Dr. McClellan has led the Bush administration's campaign to stop unauthorized drug imports. He has said such products endanger American consumers because they are often counterfeit, mislabeled or contaminated.
 Under intense questioning by several senators, Dr. McClellan appeared to soften his tone a bit on Monday. His stance took account of two political realities. Several senators have threatened to hold up his nomination if he resists drug imports. In addition, drug prices and proposals to import drugs from Canada are emerging as an issue in the presidential campaign.
 Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, has said he wants to ''allow individuals, pharmacists, wholesalers and distributors to import F.D.A.-approved prescription drugs from other countries at lower prices.'' He has also said, ''The only reason George Bush has opposed this approach is that the drug industry would lose billions in profits.''
 On Tuesday, Senator Kerry plans to join Illinois's governor, Rod R. Blagojevich, in discussing the issue with Medicare beneficiaries in Evanston, Ill. Mr. Blagojevich, a Democrat, recently encouraged an Illinois couple to file suit to overturn the federal ban on importing drugs from Canada.
 Senate Republican leaders said they hoped the Senate would confirm Dr. McClellan this week. If confirmed, he would become administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which provides health benefits to more than 70 million people who are elderly or disabled or have low incomes.
 Dr. McClellan defended the new law that offers drug coverage to Medicare beneficiaries and gives private insurers a large new role in the program.
 But he had no immediate answer when Senator Bob Graham, Democrat of Florida, asked why the administration had assumed that increased enrollment in private plans would drive up Medicare costs rather than save money.
 ''There are a lot of steps we can take to bring down costs and increase competition,'' said Dr. McClellan, who is a physician and an economist.
 President Bush and Congressional Republicans had hoped to reap political dividends from the law providing drug benefits to the elderly, but many Republicans find themselves on the defensive. Democrats have kept up a barrage of criticism, saying the law helps drug and insurance companies more than the elderly, and polls suggest that many of the elderly are not aware of the new law.
 Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine, told Dr. McClellan she had grown weary of hearing reasons the federal government could not allow drug imports from Canada.
 ''We need to hear a can-do approach,'' Ms. Snowe said, noting that both houses of Congress had signaled support for allowing drug wholesalers and pharmacists to import drugs under strict safety standards. ''What is it going to take to move this forward?'' she asked.
 One step, Dr. McClellan said, would be to restrict ''the scope and type of drugs that can be imported.''
 AARP, the lobby for older Americans, called on drug companies on Monday to limit price increases. In letters to 16 major drug manufacturers, William D. Novelli, chief executive of AARP, said prices for existing drugs should not rise faster than the Consumer Price Index, which is the basis for annual increases in Social Security benefits.
 Mr. Novelli said manufacturers should also ''constrain the prices of new drugs'' and should use their influence to ''curtail greater markups throughout the distribution chain'' to retail pharmacies.
 John C. Rother, policy director of AARP, said the organization had begun to monitor price changes for about 200 commonly prescribed drugs and would periodically report its findings to the public.
 In response to other questions, Dr. McClellan said he would not take any steps that undermined the False Claims Act, a federal law that rewards people who report fraud in government programs like Medicare and Medicaid.
 He also said that he would not approve any state Medicaid experiments that imposed firm limits on federal spending or eliminated the guarantee of specific benefits for poor people.
 ''Caps on spending are not envisioned as part of the structure'' of Medicaid, Dr. McClellan said, and ''the individual entitlement cannot be waived.''

HEADLINE: Builder Whose Cubes Are Definitely Not Square

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN

 BODY:
DOES the man make the building or does the building make the man? When the man in question is happily canoodling with the white plastic model of a sylphlike 835-foot-tall tower he wants to build, the answer seems to be: both.
 What the world needs now, according to Frank J. Sciame Jr., a fast-talking, Brooklyn-born builder/developer with a knack for turning moldy heaps of historic brick into South Street Seaport area reclamation projects, isn't love, sweet or otherwise. And it isn't more architectural paeans to the past -- though don't get him wrong, he still loves sprucing up historic sites. His repertory includes the New Victory Theater and Central Synagogue. You don't make it onto the board of the New York Landmarks Conservancy without a sentimental side; this is a guy who saved the childhood toy, a vintage Erector set, that hooked him on this business in the first place. 
 ''Hey, I still have great respect for historic buildings and for history,'' he says, straightening his glossy purple tie against the white shirt that complements his Florida tan (he moors his powerboat, Competitive Bid 3, there). ''What other developer would forgo the available air rights in order to be true to historic scale the way we're doing on Front Street? But you've also got to build the landmarks of the future: the way I see it, it's almost a responsibility.'' 
 So it's Mr. Sciame's most futuristic, and costliest, project that has him smitten, a structure that has no precedent in the United States and whose frontier mood is attributable to the post-Sept. 11 phoenix syndrome that infects him. He intends to stack a dozen or so celestial apartments atop a cultural center to accentuate what he considers to be the under-decorated airspace above the East River, a gossamer sculpture of see-through cubes with high art aspirations and a price tag to match. He's so sure this is what New York City needs that he's displacing, then demolishing, his own company headquarters on South Street to make it happen.
 And how much will it cost him to build the Santiago Calatrava-designed extravaganza that attracted the oohs, ahs and apparent enthusiasm of city planning officials and couture architects alike last week when its blueprints were unveiled, and will, he predicts, become a 21st-century icon of the renaissance of downtown Manhattan? 
 He hems, haws, and caves. ''In excess of $100 million,'' he says, breaking into a light sweat as he removes his suit jacket. ''I wouldn't have been as confident and excited about this building, maybe, before 9/11, but with New York showing that it's going to rebuild downtown better than ever, and to stand proud, this just seems like the right building for the right time.'' And, he insists, it is so not a vanity project: ''It may make a statement, but it's not being built to make a statement. Having been a builder for 28 years, it has a way of keeping your ego in check.'' 
 So does working on a project that, on Sept. 11, was obliterated: Mr. Sciame's construction firm did the interior of the Windows on the World restaurant in 1996, as a commemorative plaque on an office shelf attests. 
 He's been a developer for only eight years, and figures this skyscraper will validate his skills the way projects like the Seamen's Church Institute at the Seaport and the PenMor Farms development in Muttontown on Long Island, near his home in Locust Valley, anchored the construction company: ''The tall ships used to mark the seaport, and now we're going to mark it. This will be the future landmark of the East River waterfront, and I don't see anything wrong with that!''
 HAD Mr. Calatrava not joined the project, a more conventional residential tower might have ensued, but Mr. Sciame, a C.C.N.Y. graduate with an architecture degree but no exceptional architectural prowess, has been mesmerized by great design since college. 
 ''I recognized while I was still at school that I was not going to be the next Frank Lloyd Wright: I was more like Salieri,'' he says. ''I recognized good design but I couldn't create good design. But I always loved building things. You have to have the optimism of a test pilot to be in the construction business.'' The son of a union painter -- he says his sense of humor comes from dad, his business sense from mom, a housewife -- he built storefronts for hair salons during college. When he went into business for himself in 1975, his first job was the $75 repair of a gate at New York University. Next came a $2,500 stucco job, then a $45,000 dance studio, and he was on his way.
 In Mr. Calatrava, who invited him to breakfast at the Four Seasons Hotel in 2002 to enlist his help on a personal remodeling job (Mr. Sciame, who had hoped he was being hired to build the Atlanta Symphony Hall, was initially crushed but rebounded nicely), he has found his Mozart. ''It only took 15 minutes with him for the genius of the man to come through! I've met my match in enthusiasm.''
 Mr. Sciame, an otherwise rational businessman of 52 and a devoted papa of four, giddily insists on posing with the model of the proposed 90 South Street Tower on his conference table. Happily married to his high school sweetheart, Barbara, he has no need of a trophy wife. But a trophy building concocted by the same trophy architect who, two weeks after they signed this contract, was named to design the reincarnated World Trade Center transit hub? Count him in. 
 ''I'll hug it, kiss it, anything,'' he tells the photographer. ''But only for this building!''

 CORRECTION:
An architectural rendering on March 3 with an article about a design by Santiago Calatrava for an apartment tower in Lower Manhattan, and another version with a front-page contents entry, carried an incomplete credit. (The error occurred again in some editions yesterday.) While Mr. Calatrava's studio created the image of the building, the background photograph was by David Sundberg/Esto.

HEADLINE: A Musical Gift to Faithful Messengers

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
Some people who review theater for a living were not kind to Elizabeth Swados when ''Missionaries'' played the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 1997. They dismissed her musical meditation on the murder of four American churchwomen in El Salvador as earnest and preachy.
 People who live to do missionary work, however, found it to be a faithful portrayal of the comforts they sacrifice and the dangers they risk to fight physical and spiritual poverty in the third world. They took Ms. Swados's singing nuns to heart, making the show a word-of-mouth hit in more modest -- but more appreciative -- venues of schools and churches. 
 Now Ms. Swados has flipped the script. Her latest musical, ''Ten Years of Hope,'' is a look at the immigrant women who fled countries like El Salvador in search of a haven and a fresh start in Brooklyn, where drama comes though learning English, getting a job and caring for their families. It is not so much a sequel to ''Missionaries'' as it is payback to two urban missionaries who were among the first show's most loyal supporters.
 Sisters Mary Burns and Mary Dowd commissioned the piece to mark the 10th anniversary of their Maura Clarke-Ita Ford Center in Bushwick, Brooklyn, which is named after two Maryknoll nuns who were killed in the attack in El Salvador in 1980. Ms. Swados accepted the commission from the Two Marys, as she calls them, but not their money. Her time with the nuns, she would later say, gave her a new take on faith, immigrants and the city.
 ''We live in a time which is so negative and cynical about helping people rise,'' Ms. Swados said during rehearsals for the show, which was limited to two fund-raising performances. ''But it is good to be generous. It is good to put yourself on the line for people, because so very few people are doing that now.''
 As the Two Marys know, there are little sanctuaries around the city like their center, where nuns help immigrants and the poor with no fanfare. The tasks are mundane and decidedly unglamorous: teaching English, helping the immigrants finish school or find work and a decent place to live. This happens every day, despite the drop in religious vocations or news of scandals in the Roman Catholic Church.
 ''There are many of these little pockets around the city, which you never see,'' Sister Mary Burns said. ''That is where the women religious are. We're just not that visible because we work with the invisible.''
 Ms. Swados, a playwright and composer, had befriended the Two Marys after ''Missionaries'' played the Brooklyn Academy of Music. They persuaded her to stage it around New York and eagerly talked it up to other religious communities across the country. The two were tireless promoters, a skill that came easily after many years of believing in people others would forget.
 ''I kept calling them the best producers I ever had,'' Ms. Swados said. ''It is very hard to get anything done in New York. We really had an incredible run because of them.''
 So there was little Ms. Swados could do but say yes when the Two Marys asked her last year to write a show about the Brooklyn center and its women. She spent hours talking to the two nuns, visiting the center to interview the women and reading everything from newspaper clips to newsletters and liturgy.
 Where others saw charity cases, she saw determined women who uprooted themselves to make sure their children had a shot at success. The lives of the nuns and the immigrants inspired a fanfare for common dreams and everyday miracles: whether it was getting a last-minute grant to keep the center open or a spontaneous party to celebrate a job or a diploma.
 The key to understanding it, Ms. Swados said, was to understand the religion and faith that drove the nuns and the women, something that could have proven daunting to someone like her who was raised Jewish.
 ''That is one thing about 'Missionaries' -- get the religion right or you do not get the motivation of the women right,'' she said. ''In the same way, if you do not get the religion right, you do not get the motivation for why the Two Marys founded the center or why the women go there.''
 She would later joke that her Jewish faith made it inevitable that she write ''Ten Years of Hope.''
 ''As a Jew I'm supposed to do this,'' she said. ''It's called a mitzvah. I think I'm buying some good Jewish time from this.''
 The musical -- a 15-song choral work for six actresses -- may not have the appeal of those who favor operatic phantoms or dancing cats. But it was welcomed by a small army of gray-haired nuns who attended its premiere on Feb. 29 at the Mary Louis Academy in Jamaica Estates, Queens.
 The keenest critics were the immigrant women who also sat in the audience and nodded when the actors sang about the fear that consumes them in this country. ''I'm very sensitive, and I cry for anything,'' said Ada Martinez, one of the first women to seek help at the center. ''They expressed it the way it really happened. We started from the bottom and have gone ahead with each step.''
 Elsa Bonilla could not attend the show, but she had already lived it. Ms. Bonilla came to the United States three years ago from El Salvador, where one of her college teachers was among six Jesuits killed by the army in 1989. The day of the show, she was working as a cashier, a job she hoped to quit once she has learned enough English to resume her career in finance and economics.
 Like other immigrants at the center, she knows you do not have to know English to spend your money. Making the money to spend, however, is another matter.
 ''I want to learn English to develop myself,'' she said, during a break in her English lesson. ''To come to this country and not know English is to feel ignorant. Like you are a peasant.''
 Such battles are the stuff of drama, Ms. Swados insists. They are won through old-fashioned self-reliance, mutual help and unwavering belief.
 If anything, the play, the center and the missionaries are about faith. ''Ten Years of Hope'' begins with a famous line Sister Ita Ford wrote to a niece, encouraging her to find ''something worth living for, perhaps worth dying for.'' In the other America of Bushwick, a small group of women found plenty to live for.
 Those words also changed Ms. Swados. 
 ''This has helped me with my faith,'' she said. ''My faith is very practical. It is about helping people to sing, dance and make shows. It could have been squashed by bad reviews or bad experiences. But when I am with these women, I understand why it is I do what I do. I understand what it means to give something.''

HEADLINE: The High Cost of Gasoline

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 As long as Americans are unwilling to change their gas consumption habits, we deserve what we get (''Motorists Chafing Under a Steady Rise in Gasoline Prices,'' news article, March 6). I'm no economist, but isn't it likely that less consumption would lead to more inventory, which would lead to lower prices at the pump? 
 I've been driving a hybrid car for more than two years; I fill up once or twice a month, for about $13. But it seems that no matter how high gas prices may climb (and never mind the effect on the environment), many folks will still insist on their right to drive the biggest, baddest vehicle they can afford. What a sad legacy to leave to those who will inhabit this planet after us.

HEADLINE: Ford to Use Toyota's Hybrid Technology

BYLINE: By TODD ZAUN; Danny Hakim in Detroit contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 9 

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company will license hybrid technology from the Toyota Motor Corporation in a deal that could help establish Toyota's system as a standard for the industry.
 Toyota has been trying to sell its hybrid system to a variety of automakers to help offset its high development cost. Ford will incorporate the Toyota technology into a hybrid system it plans to introduce late this year in a gasoline-electric version of its Escape sport utility vehicle, the two companies said yesterday in a statement. 
 The Ford vehicle would be the first hybrid offered by an American carmaker and the first application of hybrid technology in a S.U.V. Powered by the combination of a gasoline engine and an electric motor, hybrids are more fuel-efficient and less polluting than vehicles with traditional gasoline engines. 
 Toyota, a close rival to Ford in terms of global vehicle sales volume, has established a strong lead in hybrid vehicles. The carmaker became the first to mass produce hybrids with the introduction of the Prius sedan in 1997. Demand for the latest version of the Prius has been stronger than Toyota expected, though sales volume remains small compared with mainstream models like the Camry.
 The Ford deal follows a similar pact between Toyota and the Nissan Motor Company, which agreed in 2002 to license Toyota's gas-electric hybrid system for use in vehicles that Nissan plans to sell in the United States by 2006. 
 But Ford is leasing considerably less technology than Nissan. Although Toyota says it makes money on its hybrid vehicles, analysts say it may be a long time before hybrids are a significant source of income given the high cost of developing the vehicles and their relatively low sales volumes. 
 Toyota sold 53,000 hybrid vehicles globally last year, or less than 1 percent of its worldwide sales of 6.07 million vehicles.
 Automakers that use any of Toyota's patents are likely to have a more difficult time making money. At a Detroit media event in January, Carlos Ghosn, the chief executive of Nissan, said that the Altima hybrid would not be profitable.
 For Toyota, the licensing agreement with Ford is not expected to be a big revenue generator. 
 Kurt Sanger, auto analyst for ING Securities in Tokyo, said the importance of the deal with Ford was that ''Toyota is setting the standard for the hybrid power train.'' 
 ''Toyota is making strides to build critical mass for its hybrid program,'' Mr. Sanger said. 
 Under the agreement announced yesterday, Toyota will license to Ford a patented hybrid control system that links a gasoline engine with an electric motor. The companies refused to disclose the terms of the licensing agreement or how much Ford would pay in royalties. In addition, the companies agreed to license to each other emission reduction technologies that each has developed.
 So far, American automakers have been less enthusiastic than their Japanese rivals about hybrid vehicles, arguing that it is difficult to justify the added cost of the technology when few American consumers seem concerned about fuel economy. For several years, Toyota and Honda have been the only automakers selling mass-market hybrid cars. And so far, they are the only companies with concrete plans to offer a range of the vehicles.
 Toyota already sells a hybrid minivan in Japan and plans to roll out a hybrid version of its Lexus RX 330 S.U.V., the RX 400h, later this year in the United States. Toyota also plans to introduce a hybrid version of its Highlander S.U.V. in the United States next year. It has set a goal of making 300,000 hybrid vehicles a year by mid-decade. 
 Honda, which sells two gasoline-electric vehicles, the Insight and the Civic Hybrid, also plans to offer a hybrid version of its Accord sedan.
 The new hybrids from Ford, Toyota and Honda will be more expensive than traditional gasoline-powered versions of the same vehicles, though the companies have not yet said by how much.

HEADLINE: A Sports Arena Gets Religion

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN; Jeff Yip contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: HOUSTON 

 BODY:
Lakewood Church in this sprawling city's northeast section is so busy that Sunday morning services in the 7,800-seat sanctuary take place in two shifts, traffic backs up on the nearest Interstate 610 exit and police officers are needed to direct the lines of cars into the jammed parking lot.
 At one recent service, the seats were filled with worshippers pumping their arms and singing along with an energetic choirmaster whose image was projected on giant television screens. People cheered as the minister, Joel Osteen, announced that construction crews had begun work on a new home for the church and that as much as $45 million in donations had been pledged to help pay for it.
 For several years, Lakewood Church has felt squeezed in its current home. As a multiracial church that draws more than 25,000 people on weekends, Lakewood is the largest of the 30 churches in the nation with more than 8,000 members, said John N. Vaughn, the owner of Church Growth Today, a research and consulting company. 
 Recently, the church signed a long-term lease with the city to occupy the Compaq Center, a 29-year-old former basketball arena on the opposite end of town. The church is spending $75 million to renovate the arena and add a five-story building on its eastern side with more than 200,000 square feet of classrooms and television production offices and will pay $11.8 million in rent in advance for the first 30 years.
 The Irvine Team, a Houston-based company that focuses on design and construction strategy, is overseeing the redevelopment.
 Much of the money is being spent on features that will enhance the visual effect of the services, which are seen on nearly three dozen television channels around the country, said Duncan Dodds, the executive director of Lakewood Church. 
 ''We want to appeal to all your senses,'' said Mr. Dodds, a former marketing and advertising executive. He said the church was focusing on ''the things that are kind of a wow, so that when you walk in, it will take your breath away.''
 In making a play for the Compaq Center, Lakewood Church faced competition from the Crescent Real Estate Equities Company, a publicly traded company based in Fort Worth and the owner of Greenway Plaza, the five-million-square-foot high-end office complex that surrounds the arena.
 Crescent, which hoped to tear down the arena and eventually put up a new office building, sued the city after the proposal from Lakewood Church was accepted, saying that the lease would violate deed restrictions on the arena. The suit was settled last year, after the city agreed to buy 5.5 acres of space in front of the George R. Brown Convention Center from Crescent for $33 million.
 Dawn Ullrich, director of the city's Convention and Entertainment Facilities Department, said that the city's decision to lease the Compaq Center to Lakewood Church was ''driven by economics'' because the church was willing to pay rent that equaled the appraised value of the arena. ''Because Lakewood's offer was so good,'' she said, ''it was very appealing from an economic point of view.''
 Lakewood Church will not be the first religious institution to hold services in a place where sports fans used to gather, but it will apparently be the first to physically transform an arena into a church. In 2001, the Faithful Central Bible Church bought the Forum in Inglewood, Calif., where the Lakers played before the Staples Center opened. The church holds services there and also rents out the arena for pop music concerts.
 In recent years, more than 30 arenas have been built across the country as professional sports teams have demanded improved sightlines and up-to-date amenities -- luxury sky boxes, club seating, wider concourses and more bathrooms. The question of what to do with the old arenas has bedeviled public officials. Often, the structures themselves are far from decrepit and are still burdened with millions of dollars of debt but are no longer wanted.
 Last week, after years of trying to find other uses for the Miami Arena, where the Heat played basketball from 1988 to 2000, the Miami Sports and Exhibition Authority took the first steps toward selling it to the owner of a chain of parking garages. 
 With the FedEx Forum about to open, Memphis officials are seeking ways to preserve the Pyramid, a prominent part of the city's skyline since it opened in 1991. Dallas has yet to decide the fate of Reunion Arena, built in 1980. And in Houston, where the Sam Houston Coliseum was torn down in 1998, Harris County officials may allow the Astrodome, once labeled the ''eighth wonder of the world,'' to be turned into an attraction with a space theme.
 Some secondary arenas limp along with college sports or animal or truck shows but most wind up under a wrecking ball, like USAirways Arena in Landover, Md., which is the site of a shopping center.
 Bill Rhoda, a principal in the Dallas office of Conventions, Sports and Leisure International, a consulting company, describes the Lakewood Church project as ''one of the most creative alternate uses'' for an unwanted arena. ''The majority are torn down,'' he said. ''They are usually single-purpose structures, built with a focus on entertainment events and fairly expensive to renovate.''
 For the Compaq Center renovation, the most costly elements involve acoustics and lighting, said Dennis Irvine, the president of the Irvine Team, the company that is overseeing work by more than 20 specialty consultants. The acoustics might have been adequate for rock concerts but needed to be overhauled so that sermons could be heard clearly, he said. A sound separation barrier will be installed below the seats to prevent extraneous noises from interfering with the television broadcasts. Another costly addition will be a plant for heating and air-conditioning, which were previously supplied by the Greenway Plaza office complex.
 In keeping with the church's desire for eye-catching effects, a stage is being created with a circular staircase to accommodate a 250-member choir that will be flanked by waterfalls. The orchestra pit will move up and down. Columns and lighting will be added to the pink concrete exterior.
 The basketball court is being raised to provide raked seating, much like a movie theater, so that even with the stage, the church will hold 16,000 people, the same number as the arena. As a cost-saving measure, however, many of the existing green seats -- which are currently covered in plastic -- will not be replaced.
 Even though construction is already under way, the plans are being continually refined to keep costs within the budget, said Lorrie Foreman, the project manager for Irvine. Recently, for example, she learned that the rocks placed under the waterfalls would cost $40,000 more than the budget allowed. ''We have to eliminate some of the rocks,'' she said.
 Ms. Foreman said the design team hoped to be able to cut costs enough to provide the money for a $500,000 fountain.
 Mr. Irvine said he did not expect to create a niche business out of retrofitting old sports arenas because there are only so many really big churches, but he said that Houston and the church were setting a good example. ''Houston has been a 'tear it down, build it new' kind of city for so long,'' he said. ''What I love is that Houston is the first one I know doing this.''
 Mr. Osteen, the minister, said that had Lakewood built a new church, it probably would not have been in as prime a location as the Compaq Center, which is right off Highway 59, a major artery.
 ''The building is in fine shape for what we need it for,'' Mr. Osteen said. ''We can preserve a landmark, and give it the money to bring it up to date.''
 With the lawsuit behind him, John C. Goff, Crescent's chief executive, said the church had begun to help attract new restaurant and retail tenants to Greenway Plaza. In December, Tony's, a 39-year-old restaurant near the Galleria shopping center known for attracting celebrities, announced that it would move to a 10,000-square-foot space near the Compaq Center.
 Referring to the church, Mr. Goff said, ''We feel they are going to be great neighbors.''

SECTION: Section C; Column 1; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 9; COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE: REGIONAL MARKET -- Union Square

LENGTH: 785 words

HEADLINE: New Retail Life in Old Mercantile District

BYLINE: By ROSALIE R. RADOMSKY

 BODY:
A onetime department store building on the south side of Union Square in Manhattan that has been vacant for three years is to come back to life in the next year with four retailers, each occupying much of one or more floors. 
 Four chain stores are taking space: Whole Foods Market, the clothing stores Forever 21 and Filene's Basement, and a shoe store, DSW. The businesses expect to move into the six-story, 250,000-square-foot building, at 4 Union Square South, as each of their spaces is completed in a $46 million renovation by the owner, Vornado Realty Trust. 
 Once the site of the first Ohrbach's store, the space was later occupied by J.W. Mays and most recently by Bradlees. ''The building is on a central square in New York City facing a beautiful public place,'' said Melvyn H. Blum, president of Vornado Development, a division of Vornado Realty Trust, which bought it in 1993 for $20 million. 
 Even before Bradlees moved out three years ago, Vornado looked at various uses for the building -- which is in fact two structures joined as one, the first of concrete and the other on a steel framework.. At one point, the bond trader Cantor Fitzgerald, whose World Trade Center offices were destroyed in the September 2001 terrorist attacks, seriously considered rebuilding its headquarters there. 
 Vornado ''looked at residential, office, office and retail,'' Mr. Blum said.
 ''We spoke to dozens of prospective tenants,'' he continued. ''The best economic solution for us and the neighborhood was retail on all floors, and we gave all four tenants great access on 14th Street.'' 
 Well over 500,000 passers-by go through the Union Square corridor daily, according to the Union Square Partnership, a nonprofit group set up 20 years ago to help revitalize the area. The partnership said that on average, 89,208 pedestrians a day pass the Vornado building, based on a clicker count it took on a day last June.
 ''It's a mixed-use district,'' said Karen H. Shaw, executive director of the partnership. ''We have offices. We have residents. We have students. And we have the largest and oldest Greenmarket in the city open four days a week. People are always here.'' 
 The building -- now covered by a blue sidewalk shed on its three sides on East 14th Street, East 13th Street and University Place -- is to feature a new glass, aluminum and light tan granite facade looking onto the park. 
 When Bradlees opened a decade ago, it put windows into what had been a windowless, glazed white brick and blue mosaic tile building put up by Mays in 1965. That structure replaced a building where Ohrbach's stood until it moved uptown in 1954.
 The facade now being installed ''is trying to measure up to the cast-iron masonry-based buildings on the other side of the park,'' said Yann Leroy, a principal of Brennan Beer Gorman Architects, the facade's designer. The firm worked jointly on the project with the architects Beyer Blinder Belle.
 ''It was a more modernistic interpretation of that cast-iron character,'' said Mr. Leroy, whose firm also helped transform the Guardian Life Building at the northeast end of the park into the W Union Square hotel in 2000. 
 A three-level Whole Foods Market is to occupy 47,000 square feet on the lower, ground and mezzanine levels. When that opens in the winter, Whole Foods expects to have a cafe similar to the seating area at its Time Warner Center market, which opened in February. 
 Forever 21, a Los Angeles-based women's clothing chain, with 26,000 square feet on the ground and mezzanine levels, expects to have its space ready by late fall. 
 Filene's Basement, the off-price clothing chain, is to have 92,000 square feet on the third to fifth floors, and to share a two-story lobby with DSW, both of them owned by Retail Ventures of Columbus, Ohio. DSW, which sells shoes at a discount, will occupy the second floor with a sales area of 26,000 square feet. Both chains plan to open in August. 
 The building is not fully leased. It has a total of more than 5,000 square feet on two floors available, with an entrance on University Place, and discussions are under way with possible tenants -- a number of them restaurants.
 Brokers said rents for the Whole Foods space averaged $68 a square foot annually, while Forever 21 is averaging $100 a square foot and Filene's Basement and DSW are paying $35 to $40 a square foot. 
 There will be three loading docks on 13th Street and five freight elevators -- with one of the docks and two freight elevators to be used exclusively by Whole Foods. 
 ''Most retail buildings don't have this capacity for loading where trucks can back into a dock,'' Mr. Blum said. ''Most trucks have to double-park and bring things into the front door.''

HEADLINE: Brazil's Shrimp Caught Up in a Trade War

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: ITAPISSUMA, Brazil 

 BODY:
The shrimp farms that have sprung up all along the coast here are one of Brazil's great success stories, cited by government officials as an example of the country's ability to compete on world markets. From 1998 to 2003, Brazil's shrimp exports jumped from a mere 400 tons to more than 58,000, with a third of that going to the United States.
 During the boom, few companies have prospered more than Netuno S.A., which grows shrimp in 64 ponds at an 1,850-acre farm here and also buys from scores of other producers throughout the region. Founded 15 years ago as a modest market selling fish and lobster to local customers and hotels, Netuno is now Brazil's largest single exporter of shrimp to the United States. 
 ''Like everyone else in Brazil, we started off late in this business, without a formula for exporting,'' said Hugo Campos, the industrial production director. ''The idea was to grow as much as we could, and the boom in world demand for shrimp has been our path to success.''
 Now, though, producers here are facing a serious new challenge in their biggest market. On Dec. 31, the Southern Shrimp Alliance filed a dumping complaint against Brazil and five other countries, seeking to impose tariffs of up to 300 percent, and last month the Commerce Department ruled that there were grounds to proceed because there were indications of a ''danger of injury'' to American producers.
 ''We're really getting killed over here,'' Eddie Gordon, president of the Southern Shrimp Alliance, said in a telephone interview from Mount Pleasant, S.C. ''Prices are so low that our boat owners can't even afford to go out shrimping, and that's because the product is being sold against what all our trade agreements are.''
 Brazilian shrimp growers deny that they have engaged in unfair trade practices, arguing that they are merely benefiting from a natural competitive advantage. They point to significantly lower labor costs, the availability of cheap land and, above all, a benevolent tropical climate that allows them not only higher productivity per acre, but three harvests a year.
 Politically, the dispute could hardly be more inconveniently timed. Though Brazil and the United States are the leaders of the talks aimed at establishing a Free Trade Area of the Americas by the end of this year, the government of Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has expressed doubts about the desirability of such an accord, sometimes in piquant terms.
 Specifically, Brazil fears that the United States is trying to impose a free trade accord that will not remove the subsidies and other barriers that have limited Latin America's exports of agricultural products to the United States. Until the Bush administration yields on that point, the Brazilians and their allies argue, there is no point talking about fully opening markets here to more American goods and services.
 In that atmosphere of suspicion, the shrimp case is seen here as politically motivated and abusive. As Brazilian government officials and news reports have repeatedly pointed out, the Southern Shrimp Alliance represents shrimpers in eight states, including Florida and Texas, and this is an election year.
 Producers here and in the other five mostly Asian countries named in the complaint are supported by the American Seafood Distributors Association. That group, which represents supermarkets, processors, restaurants and hotels, says it is American shrimpers who are engaging in unfair trade practices.
 ''A continued supply of imported shrimp is critical to consumers and seafood companies because it cannot be replaced by increased domestic production,'' the group argues in a recent document. ''Current efforts to restrict trade in these circumstances constitute pure protectionism.''
 The dumping complaint does not contend that Brazil is selling shrimp on the American market below the cost of production, the most common definition of dumping. Rather, it contends that Brazil is price gouging by selling its product below ''fair market value,'' an assertion that shrimp farmers here dismiss as not reflecting market realities.
 ''The producer in Brazil doesn't dictate the price of the product, which is set by a company in the United States,'' said Itamar Rocha, president of the Brazilian Association of Shrimp Growers. ''We're completely at the mercy of the middleman, who is already forcing us to sacrifice on prices, and yet they still concoct this case against us.''
 An even more fundamental difference, however, has to do with the economic differences between farmed and sea-caught shrimp. Most shrimp produced in the United States comes from trawlers plying the Gulf of Mexico or the Atlantic Ocean, while almost all production here, as in Asia, is done on farms.
 ''It's like trying to compare vinyl discs and CD's,'' said Luiz Claudio Duarte, a lawyer with the firm of Cameron & Hornbostel who is representing Brazilian shrimp farmers in the dispute. ''Raising shrimp in captivity is not the same as going out to sea to capture them, and so this complaint is totally absurd.''
 Shrimp producers here argue that there is simply no way for American shrimpers operating from trawlers to compete against more efficient farms. Production in the United States has stalled over the last decade, they maintain, because of the vagaries of weather, overfishing, high costs and a reluctance to embrace aquaculture.
 ''We saw the writing on the wall,'' said Mark Kleinberg, an American who formerly had a shrimp fleet in Brownsville, Tex., and has shifted operations to northeast Brazil. ''Shrimp boats cannot compete because insurance premiums and the cost of diesel fuel, repairs and maintenance are so high, and if you try to keep that around, you're just dragging out the misery.''
 But American shrimpers dispute that claim. ''All we are doing is harvesting, which is cheaper than trying to raise shrimp yourself,'' Mr. Gordon said. ''It's much harder and requires a lot more effort and cost to raise shrimp larvae and build a pond for them than to just go out to harvest them at sea.''

HEADLINE: The Trouble With Germany

 BODY:
Europe is doing much worse than the United States economically, right? Not if you subtract Germany. Without Germany's figures, Europe's economic performance would arguably look as good as America's. That gives some sense of how bad things are in the German economy, the continent's biggest, and how critical it is for the Germans to get serious about reform -- not only for their own sake, but also for the sake of the European Union, which is bracing for the entry of a host of far poorer members.
 Germany is in the grip of a profound malaise. The economy contracted by 0.1 percent last year and is headed for growth of only 1.5 percent this year. Unemployment stands at 10.3 percent. Huge public deficits are running afoul of the pact that Germany itself forced on euro-zone members. Consumers and investors lack confidence. The reasons for the problems are no mystery: a lavish welfare system, which the state can no longer afford, and high labor costs, which send businesses elsewhere. The Germans know all that full well, just as they know that they need to make deep and painful changes if they are to turn things around and resume that economic miracle of which they used to be so proud. The trouble is that they are not willing to accept the consequences. Chancellor Gerhard Schroder has had to pay a heavy political price even for the meek and woefully inadequate welfare, labor and tax reforms he has attempted. 
A quarterly charge of 10 euros for health care was enough to create a major furor. Social Democrats got a drubbing in local elections in Hamburg on Sunday, and Mr. Schroder's own standing in the party is so low that he had to give up the party leadership.
 The chancellor plans to make a major speech to the nation on March 25. It's a good opportunity for him to try to persuade his countrymen of the immediate and urgent need for a thorough overhaul of the entire economic apparatus, including the antiquated system of centralized wage-bargaining, the byzantine tax system and the bloated budget. A bold wave of reform would remind Germans that they have not lost the capacity for the hard work, innovation and sacrifice that created the postwar miracle.

HEADLINE: DOLLARS FROM DANCE

BYLINE: By JENNIFER DUNNING

 BODY:
Dance in New York City generated hundreds of millions of dollars last year, said a survey by AMS Planning & Research that was released yesterday by Dance/NYC, a service and advocacy group. According to the survey, ''The Economic Activity of Dance in New York City,'' dance audiences spent $135.4 million, including $68.1 million on tickets, $29.1 million on food and $11.4 million on shopping. Dance organizations spent $121 million and employed more than 2,600 people, allocating more than $80 million to salaries during the year for full-, part-time and contract workers. The report is based on data collected from 41 New York-based dance companies and producers and from audience surveys at 19 dance performances by 13 dance companies at 9 theaters in New York between August 2002 and January 2003. The survey estimated annual direct and indirect tax benefits to the city and state at $23.2 million. Dance schools, which draw many foreign students, were not included in the survey.

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, March 9 

 BODY:
A new prime minister was appointed Tuesday to head Haiti's government until elections are held, and, in an abrupt reversal, international forces announced that they would begin disarming militants. 
 The new prime minister is Gerard Latortue, 69, a lawyer and economist who has long lived abroad but is a technocrat with a reputation for integrity. He was selected by the American-backed council of ''eminent Haitians'' assembled after the resignation, under pressure, of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide on Feb. 29. 
 The United States Marines said Tuesday that they would begin disarming thousands of militants, a sudden change from their stated policy that disarmament was not part of their mission. ''Clearly there is a change in environment,'' said Maj. Richard A. Crusan, a spokesman for the United States military forces here. ''I see a movement to getting a bit more aggressive.'' 
 The marines also shot and killed an unarmed man who sped toward a roadblock near the city's airport about 7:15 on Monday night, a United States military spokesman said Tuesday. It was the second shooting by the marines since Mr. Aristide fled the country, and the first involving an unarmed civilian. 
 The United Nations issued an appeal for $35 million in emergency aid to start a broad peacekeeping and aid mission to disarm combatants, rebuild Haiti's shattered health, education and transportation systems and begin the move toward elections. 
 The selection of Mr. Latortue was widely seen as a compromise. The two other candidates had compelling resumes and wide support. They are former Lt. Gen. Herard Abraham, a respected military man who ceded power to a civilian government, and Smark Michel, a former prime minister who turned away from the exiled president. 
 But both men had drawbacks as well. With armed rebels demanding the reconstitution of Haiti's feared army, General Abraham's military background became a liability. And Mr. Michel's past alliance with Lavalas, Mr. Aristide's party, made him less than a clean-slate candidate, experts said. Still, many said Mr. Latortue, who has lived outside Haiti since 1988, was a long shot. 
 Mr. Latortue served briefly as foreign minister in 1988, in the government of Leslie Manigat, which was installed by a military junta after the Duvalier government fell. Mr. Manigat was overthrown after less than a year in office, and Mr. Latortue went on to work for the United Nations Industrial Development Organization for many years. He is currently a business consultant in Boca Raton, Fla. 
 Military officials here said that the disarmament effort would begin Wednesday and that foreign troops would work closely with the Haitian National Police to disarm anyone carrying a weapon illegally. Col. Charles Gurganus, a Marine commander, said the disarmament effort would be ''active and reactive,'' but declined to elaborate. 
 Haiti's population is heavily armed, the legacy of Mr. Aristide's practice of giving guns to gangs of slum youths; they served to bolster Haiti's weak and demoralized police force. The flow of Colombian cocaine through Haiti has also brought weapons, and former soldiers were allowed to keep their weapons when Mr. Aristide dissolved the army in 1995. 
 Military officials here defended the shooting of the unarmed man, saying that his car roared toward Marine vehicles blocking a road near the city's industrial park and that marines frantically waved and shouted to try to get him to stop. They also fired nine rounds at the passenger-side wheel to try to stop the car, but when it kept barreling ahead, a marine fired seven rounds at the driver, killing him, Major Crusan said.

HEADLINE: Mary Lindsay, a Force as the Mayor's Wife, Dies at 77

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Mary Lindsay, who as John V. Lindsay's accomplished, blue-blood wife brought casual elegance and political acumen to his campaigns for New York City mayor and other offices while fiercely protecting the family's limited privacy, died yesterday in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 77.
 The cause was cancer, her daughter Margaret Picotte said. Mrs. Lindsay lived in Hilton Head, S.C. 
 Mr. Lindsay, who was mayor from 1966 to 1973, died on Dec. 19, 2000, at age 79.
 Mrs. Lindsay, whose energy was suggested by her vigorous bicycle rides in Central Park and the countless coffee hours she held during her husband's campaigns, was her husband's most trusted adviser. James Reston described her in The New York Times as ''smarter than 16 Yale men,'' and Mr. Lindsay once volunteered that she was tougher than he was.
 ''You can say anything in front of Mary,'' he said in a remark quoted by Vogue magazine in 1969. ''Besides, it'll save me having to tell her all over again.''
 Mrs. Lindsay preceded Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis by three years at Miss Porter's School and Vassar and redecorated Gracie Mansion in the fine manner in which the first lady had made over the White House. But Mrs. Lindsay thought designer gowns were a waste of money and bought her clothes off the shelf in department stores. Reflecting her political sagacity, she explained that locally made clothes were a critical part of the city's economy.
 Her never-disguised devotion to her children struck a responsive chord with many mothers.
 ''I have a strict rule,'' she said in an interview with The New York Post in 1971. ''Nothing is scheduled for me after 4 p.m. That's when Johnnie comes home from school.''
 She was also protective of her husband's most precious asset, time -- not to mention his peace of mind.
 ''When he needs something done I may scream around the house,'' she said in a 1969 interview with The Times. ''But when he gets home, it's all peaches and cream.''
 Mary Anne Harrison was born on Oct. 30, 1926, in Richmond, Va. Her father, Randolph Carter Harrison, was a senior vice president of Central Hanover Bank and Trust Company. Her mother, the former Mary Hawes, was president of the Garden Club of America.
 She and her two brothers grew up in Greenwich, Conn. She enjoyed a tomboy's life, developing a reputation for independence. She needed only three years to graduate from Vassar in 1947 with a degree in psychology.
 In her last year of college, she and John met when they were members of the wedding party of Nancy Walker Bush, sister of the former president George H. W. Bush, and Alexander Ellis. Mrs. Lindsay told The Post in 1965 that she first thought Mr. Lindsay was ''horrid'' because he did not pay any attention to her.
 ''Later, when we knew each other a lot better, he said he had been assigned to be very nice to the groom's younger sister,'' she said. ''I now accept that.''
 In 1948, in the kitchen of his parents' home, he asked her to marry him, she said. But he maintained he was only getting a beer.
 ''He still says that,'' she said. ''But I know John. If he wanted to get out of something, he would have managed.''
 Before her marriage she taught at the Mary C. Wheeler School in Providence, R.I., and at the Buckley School in New York.
 They were married in June 1949 and moved into a $63-a-month apartment in Stuyvesant Town in Manhattan, according to Diplomat magazine. Mr. Lindsay was making $3,600 a year with his law firm. After the couple's first two children were born, they moved into a larger Stuyvesant Town residence that cost $83 a month. Eventually, they bought a $10,000 co-op.
 She at first thought she would devote herself to being a homemaker. ''I thought it would be glorious,'' she said to The Post. ''Nothing to do but clean and be a good little housewife. I was bored to death.''
 She soon got a job at a nearby nursery school until her first child, now Katharine Lake, of Connecticut, was born.
 In addition to her, Mrs. Lindsay is survived by two other daughters, Margaret Picotte of Florida and Anne Lindsay of Massachusetts; her son, John Jr. of Connecticut; and five grandchildren.
 The demands of motherhood were soon joined by the rigors of campaigning as Mr. Lindsay won three terms as a congressman from the city's ''Silk Stocking District,'' serving from 1959 to 1965.
 She described their days at Gracie Mansion as ''beginning with chaos, ending with chaos and with a slight climactic middle.''
 The verbal skills of the slender, green-eyed woman were suggested by her answer when asked how she felt when her husband was described as ''the creator of all urban evil,'' by The Post in 1971. She at first snapped that people who criticized Mr. Lindsay were ignorant.
 Mrs. Lindsay quickly recovered.
 ''Goodness,'' she said, ''criticism is part of our heritage. It's an important feature of this country.''
 Robert Price, who helped direct Mr. Lindsay's four congressional races and first mayoral campaign, once gave Mrs. Lindsay the ultimate politician's compliment. He called her ''a political force more powerful than patronage.''

HEADLINE: Weathering the Rising Prices of Energy

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

 BODY:
In recent weeks, the price of West Texas crude oil has climbed to its highest level since the eve of the Iraq war, resulting in gasoline prices approaching $3 a gallon in some cases. Natural gas prices have remained elevated during the winter, translating into higher heating and electricity costs for millions of homes and businesses.
 The economy, meanwhile, is expanding at a 4.1 percent annual rate, weathering the rise in oil and gas costs without the faster inflation and economic stagnation associated with energy price spikes in the late 1970's and early 1980's.
 One reason for this apparent paradox is that many companies have adopted conservation measures that cushion them from higher prices. Another is that a lot of energy-intensive industries, from metal smelters to fertilizer makers, have moved offshore, so they are no longer counted in the statistics that measure the American economy. 
 ''The general damage to the economy so far has been very mild,'' said William C. Dudley, chief of United States economic research at Goldman Sachs. ''When it comes to overall spending we're less of an energy intensive society than we used to be.''
 There are some reasons for concern. ''Gas price spikes continue to idle capacity of basic chemical manufacturing in the United States and the long-term outlook remains bleak,'' said James Ray, vice president and general manager for the Texas division of the Eastman Chemical Company. In all, chemical companies have lost about 78,000 jobs because of higher natural gas prices, according to the American Chemistry Council, an industry group. 
 Airlines have also been hurt by high fuel costs. Jeff Misner, senior vice president and chief financial officer of Continental Airlines, said last month that fuel prices ''are the highest we have ever seen.''
 And economists warn that another $10 rise in prices could cause the pace of overall economic recovery to slow noticeably. Oil has already climbed $10 in the last six months to its current level of $36.28. 
 ''At current levels the U.S. economy and the expansion can absorb those increases,'' Ben S. Bernanke, a Federal Reserve governor, told reporters after a speech at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Va., this month. ''But obviously a sufficiently large increase in oil prices would slow the growth of the economy.''
 Over all, however, the United States has remained resilient to higher oil and gas prices so far because many energy-hungry manufacturing industries, like chemical making and metals smelting, have moved to cheaper locations abroad; those that remain have become more efficient.
 Total spending on energy has declined to about 7 percent of gross domestic product from 14 percent in 1981 even as energy spending per capita climbed more than 34 percent in the same period, according to the Energy Information Administration. Energy consumption per dollar of G.D.P. has fallen 32 percent since the early 1980's, according to the E.I.A.
 Some companies that might have been pinched by higher energy prices in the past have made shielding themselves from the recent increase in oil prices a priority, illustrating some of the nation's energy-efficiency gains. 
 Waste Management, for instance, began using software last year to pinpoint routes that were being duplicated by some of its 20,000 trash trucks. Doing so, the company was able to take 750 of its trucks off the road and is aiming for the same goal this year, intending to spend less on diesel fuel. Waste Management also introduced a fuel surcharge to customers three years ago that let it recoup more than half of an unexpected short-term increase in fuel costs.
 ''All things being equal, we'd like lower prices,'' said Cherie C. Rice, treasurer of Waste Management, ''but we've made ourselves more flexible for the volatility we inevitably encounter.''
 Economists estimate that each $5 increase in the price of oil shaves about half of a percentage point off the rate of economic growth, but it remains to be seen how the most recent run-up in oil will affect the recovery. Gasoline prices have reached a record this month in at least two states, Nevada and West Virginia, and approached nearly $3 a gallon in some areas of California, according to AAA, formerly the American Automobile Association.
 Overall consumer prices rose at their fastest pace in nearly a year in January, climbing 0.5 percent, largely because of the jump in energy prices, the Labor Department said last month while noting that other prices remained low.
 Mr. Bernanke, the Fed governor, said ''inflation still appears to be quite low.''
 Mark Baxter, director of the Maguire Energy Institute at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, said higher energy prices had been countered at least in part by increasing drilling and economic activity in energy-producing states like Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and New Mexico. Oklahoma, for example, has its highest count of active natural gas drilling rigs since the mid-1980's, according to Baker Hughes, a Houston energy company that tracks rig activity.
 Recently, another, perhaps more troubling, reason for the relatively muted response to higher energy costs has gained prominence among large consumers of natural gas: demand destruction. Chemical and fertilizer makers and other companies that rely on natural gas as a raw material say that much of their demand for gas has been destroyed in the last year or so by rising prices in the United States, which are already the highest in the industrialized world.
 ''Everyone complains about jobs migrating to China or India but what about the jobs we're exporting to a place like Germany, which has expensive labor costs but much cheaper natural gas,'' said Allan Fowler, vice president of Dow Chemical's operations in West Virginia, which has recently shifted some of its production to subsidiaries in Germany and other countries.
 Natural gas prices reached a record in 2003, averaging $5.40 per million British thermal units and were expected to remain above $5 per million B.T.U.'s this year as electric utilities rebuild inventories to meet air-conditioning demand over the summer, according to Energy and Environmental Analysis, an economic research company in Arlington, Va.
 Much of the robust demand for natural gas began when electricity companies in the 1990's started to build power plants fired by gas, which burns cleaner than many other fuels like coal. Natural gas, which now supplies about a quarter of the nation's energy needs, was also relatively cheap for decades, rarely rising above $2 to $3 per million B.T.U.'s. It is much harder to import natural gas than oil from countries with large reserves, though several projects are under way to increase imports of the fuel by 2007.

HEADLINE: Argentina Skirts Default On $3 Billion With I.M.F.

BYLINE: By TONY SMITH

 BODY:
Argentina and the International Monetary Fund reached a last-minute agreement yesterday to avoid a potentially damaging $3.1 billion default. 
 A government official said the Argentine central bank had made the payment to the I.M.F., due last night, after telephone negotiations between President Nestor Kirchner and the fund's interim chief, Anne Krueger.
 Had the payment not been made, this would have raised the prospect that Argentina might also default on $30 billion more that is payable in the next few months to other international lenders like the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank.
 The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, gave few details of the 30-minute conversation but indicated that both sides appeared to have stepped back from the brink of confrontation over the approval of additional I.M.F. funds that would effectively allow Argentina to roll over the payment. 
 Ms. Krueger told Mr. Kirchner that she would recommend the approval of those funds, and Mr. Kirchner promised to make the payment, the official said. There was no immediate confirmation from the I.M.F. in Washington.
 ''We don't know who blinked first,'' said John Welch, chief Latin American economist at WestLB in New York. ''It looks like there was face-saving on both sides.''
 For weeks, Mr. Kirchner has insisted that Argentina, which is slowly recovering from four years of harsh recession, would only make yesterday's payment if it had assurances that the I.M.F. would disburse the latest portion of a $13 billion assistance package.
 In a show of bravado, the government leaked word to the Argentine news media that it was preparing a Plan B, which foresaw spending the money not paid to the I.M.F. on social projects and kick-starting the economy.
 At the fund, though, a growing number of officials felt that the board had been too lenient with Argentina and were willing to call its bluff.
 Twice before, the I.M.F. has capitulated in the face of Argentine strong-arm tactics in negotiations, most recently agreeing in September to a $21 billion assistance package while allowing the country to run a much lower budget surplus, for example, than Brazil.
 ''The situation is different this time,'' said Walter Molano, head of research at BCP Securities in Greenwich, Conn. ''The I.M.F. is more concerned about its own credibility.'' 
 The fund, he said, now ''needs to be firm with Argentina.''
 ''Otherwise, it will never get other countries to adhere to its policies and recommendations,'' Mr. Molano added. 
 The industrial nations that have most influence on how the fund does its business have also indicated that their patience is wearing thin with Mr. Kirchner's refusal to repay more than a quarter of private bondholders' money and his sometimes confrontational statements.
 United States Treasury and West European officials have urged Argentina to show more flexibility.
 Speaking in Brussels yesterday, the Spanish finance minister, Rodrigo Rato, whose country has perhaps the closest economic ties to Argentina among Western industrial nations, said it was ''very important that Argentina and the I.M.F. continue cooperating.'' It was ''especially important for Argentina,'' he added. 
 The latest sign that the I.M.F. could harden its stance toward Argentina came with an announcement last week that its director, Horst Kohler, would resign to run for president of Germany and that his replacement, at least temporarily, would be Ms. Krueger, who is generally considered hawkish on Argentine payment practices.
 Yesterday, the news that default had been avoided sent the benchmark Argentine stock index up nearly 6 percent after several days of decline over fears that Argentina would eventually join the ranks of the few countries -- including Sudan, Somalia and Zimbabwe -- that have been declared in arrears with the I.M.F.
 Default would be damaging for the country's already tarnished image and make it more difficult to return to the international markets.
 More immediately, it would not bode well for chances of resuming stalled negotiations on rescheduling the $88 billion in debt owed to private investors abroad. Those talks are stuck on the government's insistence that it cannot afford to pay back more than 25 cents on the dollar of the bonds' face value. The bondholders are demanding at least 65 cents on the dollar.
 Many Argentines blame the I.M.F. and international banks, rather than their own politicians, for the country's unmanageable indebtedness and they say that a default would make little difference to their current plight.
 About half the nation's estimated 36 million people are thought to have slid into poverty in the recession, which led early in 2002 to a sharp devaluation of the Argentine peso and a failure to pay the debt owed to foreign private bondholders.
 But others insist that the economy cannot recover fully unless Argentina regains access to international capital markets.
 Last year the economy, South America's second largest, grew more than 8 percent. But growth was largely fueled by consumers' spending cash they had brought back from accounts abroad or dug out of reserves.
 ''There's obviously a limit to that,'' Mr. Welch said. ''By the third quarter, they could start needing something in terms of foreign funding.''

HEADLINE: Uneasy Over Deficit, G.O.P. Lawmakers Tackle the Budget

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE and RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 9 

 BODY:
Increasingly anxious about the deficit as a political issue, Congressional Republicans are moving to reshape President Bush's budget, with some taking aim at his planned increases for the military and even considering steps to make it harder to extend the tax cuts that expire in 2011.
 Despite their concerns, Republicans may end up approving a budget close to the president's. Indeed, Senate Republicans on Tuesday defeated, 51 to 46, a Democratic amendment that would have made it difficult for the Senate to create new tax cuts or increase spending unless the lost money was made up elsewhere. Also on Tuesday, several key Republican senators said Mr. Bush would probably secure the money he was seeking for the military budget. 
 The Republicans' willingness to consider trimming sacred cows like increases in military spending or reducing tax cuts shows how worrisome the ballooning budget deficit is. 
 Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said ''there has been a shifting of gears'' among Republicans. 
 ''Last year was about economic growth,'' Mr. Graham said. ''But this year is about deficit control.'' 
 Senator Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, a moderate, said: ''The deficit resonates as an issue, and people are going to pay attention to it. And if we don't do something on the revenue side, we are playing with fire, especially with all the C.E.O. scandals. This is hazardous territory for Republicans.''
 Republicans are of several minds on how to attack the red ink, and votes this week on the Senate floor and in the House Budget Committee will illustrate the complex task the party leadership faces in reaching a consensus on taxes and spending.
 ''We have been out of control for the last three years,'' Senator Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi, said in referring to overall Congressional spending. ''We kind of got a little carried away.''
 Mr. Lott said he was uncertain about its effects, given that Republicans ran against deficits for years could not unseat the Democratic majority until they shifted their message. ''If the Democrats want that issue and they think they can win on it,'' he said, ''let them have it.'' 
 Mr. Bush has called for Congress to make permanent his tax cuts that are now set to expire in 2011. Republican lawmakers have avoided the issue by agreeing to consider only budgets of five years' length, not covering when the tax cuts expire.
 Despite the defeat of the Democrats' pay-as-you-go amendment, Republicans, like Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, and Democrats, like Senator Russell D. Feingold of Wisconsin, have been trying to negotiate a less strict version of the proposal. Depending how it is written, such an amendment could complicate, in later years, efforts to extend tax cuts at the decade's end. 
 Many Democrats say they would favor such a proposal, even if it exempts extensions of three tax cuts that expire this year but that have bipartisan support. Those actions are ending the so-called marriage penalty, expanding the 10 percent tax bracket and keeping the $1,000 annual tax credit for children, instead of allowing it to revert to $700. Extending those three cuts is expected to cost $80 billion over five years.
 Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, said he found it hard to believe that Republicans would agree to anything that would render it more difficult to make permanent the much more costly tax cuts that expire in 2011. 
 ''But that's the kind of fiscal discipline that's going to be required if we're going to turn this deficit around,'' Mr. Daschle said.
 Some moderates and conservatives have also joined in an effort to trim the $27 billion, or 7 percent, increase in military spending that Mr. Bush seeks. The proposed budget resolution being debated in the Senate would give the Pentagon a $20 billion, or 5 percent, increase.
 Some Republicans, including Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, have promised to give Mr. Bush everything that he seeks.
 The new focus on spending reflects growing unrest among constituents about spending after the adoption of a $400 billion Medicare drug benefit last year and a huge catchall spending measure as an early order of business this year, said Brian M. Riedl, an analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative group.
 ''Certainly this level of resolve over spending was not present last year,'' Mr. Riedl said. ''If the Republicans want to seize the title of fiscal conservatives, they have a lot of work cut out for them and a lot of difficult decisions to make.''
 Liberal groups scoff at the notion that domestic spending has been the problem, saying that Mr. Bush's tax cuts and steep increases in spending on the military and domestic security are driving the deficit, estimated this year at $478 billion.
 The Republicans' proposal in the Senate, by Don Nickles, the Budget Committee chairman, would cut $113 billion from domestic programs over five years, excluding the military and domestic security, compared with what current law would spend, according to Richard Kogan, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal group. 
 Democrats also say the emerging Republican approach to spending restraint works against other segments of the economy. For instance, the White House is threatening to veto a highway bill being written in Congress because of its costs. Yet lawmakers from both parties agree that the bill would create a substantial number of new positions. 
 The recognition that they need to get a handle on spending is reflected not just in the budget. Senate Republicans have cut in half a $30 billion energy measure from last year in hope of getting it through Congress.
 Democrats have been pounding on the president and Congress for squandering the Clinton-era surplus, and there is evidence that the attacks resonate. Recent polls have found that the public rates the deficit as an important problem and gives Mr. Bush poor marks for his handling of the issue. One survey also found that the public preferred controlling the deficit by canceling tax cuts rather than cutting programs like health and education. 
 ''There are really deep differences of opinion, even among the Republicans, with regard to the direction we ought to take,'' Mr. Daschle said, adding. ''I don't know that there is any consensus among Republicans today.''

HEADLINE: A Nuclear 9/11

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF. 
E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

 BODY:
A 10-kiloton nuclear bomb (a pipsqueak in weapons terms) is smuggled into Manhattan and explodes at Grand Central. Some 500,000 people are killed, and the U.S. suffers $1 trillion in direct economic damage.
 That scenario, cited in a report last year from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, could be a glimpse of our future. We urgently need to control nuclear materials to forestall that threat, but in this war on proliferation, we're now slipping backward. President Bush (after ignoring the issue before 9/11) now forcefully says the right things -- but still doesn't do enough. 
 ''We're losing the war on proliferation,'' Andrew F. Krepinevich Jr., a military expert and executive director of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, says bluntly.
 Until recently, nuclear trends looked encouraging. President Kennedy and others in the early 1960's expected dozens of countries to develop atomic weapons quickly, but in fact controls largely worked. Even now, only eight nations definitely possess nuclear weapons.
 And there's more good news. While I believe that the invasion of Iraq was a mistake, at least Saddam Hussein won't be making warheads soon. Likewise, partly thanks to Mr. Bush's saber-rattling, Libya is abandoning its weapons program.
 But all in all, the risks of a nuclear 9/11 are growing. ''I wouldn't be at all surprised if nuclear weapons are used over the next 15 or 20 years,'' said Bruce Blair, president of the Center for Defense Information, ''first and foremost by a terrorist group that gets its hands on a Russian nuclear weapon or a Pakistani nuclear weapon.'' 
 One of our biggest setbacks is in North Korea. Thanks to the ineptitude of hard-liners in Mr. Bush's administration, and their refusal to engage in meaningful negotiations, North Korea is going all-out to make warheads. It may have just made six new nuclear weapons. Then there's Iran, which has sought nuclear weapons since the days of the shah, and whose nuclear program seems to have public support. ''I'm not sure there is a way to get an Iranian government to give it up,'' a senior American official said. 
 Finally, there's the real rogue nation of proliferation, Pakistan. We know that Abdul Qadeer Khan, the Islamist father of Pakistan's bomb, peddled materials to Libya and North Korea, and we don't know who else.
 ''It may be that A. Q. Khan & Associates already have passed bomb-grade nuclear fuel to the Qaeda, and we are in for the worst,'' warns Paul Leventhal, founding president of the Nuclear Control Institute.
 It's mystifying that the administration hasn't leaned on Pakistan to make Dr. Khan available for interrogation to ensure that his network is entirely closed. Several experts on Pakistan told me they believe that the administration has been so restrained because its top priority isn't combating nuclear proliferation -- it's getting President Pervez Musharraf's help in arresting Osama bin Laden before the November election.
 Another puzzle is why an administration that spends hundreds of billions of dollars in Iraq doesn't try harder to secure uranium and plutonium in Russia and elsewhere. The bipartisan program to secure weapons of mass destruction is starved for funds -- but Mr. Bush is proposing a $41 million cut in ''cooperative threat reduction'' with Russia.
 ''We're at this crucial point,'' warns Joseph Cirincione of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ''And how we handle these situations in the next couple of years will tell us whether the nuclear threat shrinks or explodes. Perhaps literally.''
 The steps that are needed, like negotiating seriously with North Korea and securing sites in Russia, aren't as dramatic as bombing Baghdad. But unless we act more aggressively, we will get a wake-up call from a nuclear explosion or, more likely, a ''dirty bomb'' that uses radioactive materials routinely lying around hospitals and factories. To clarify the stakes, here's a scenario from the Federation of American Scientists for a modest terrorist incident:
 A stick of cobalt, an inch thick and a foot long, is taken from among hundreds of such sticks at a food irradiation plant. It is blown up with just 10 pounds of explosives in a ''dirty bomb'' at the lower tip of Manhattan, with a one-mile-per-hour breeze blowing. Some 1,000 square kilometers in three states is contaminated, and some areas of New York City become uninhabitable for decades.

HEADLINE: Chance to Revive Sales Draws Nuclear Industry to China

BYLINE: By CHRIS BUCKLEY

DATELINE: BEIJING, March 9 

 BODY:
China plans to significantly expand its nuclear power in the coming decades, and the Bush administration has been courting the country's top officials on behalf of American companies seeking a starring role in that expansion.
 The United States is competing with France, Russia and, in a minor way, Canada to build four 1,000-megawatt plants that energy executives say will signify China's coming of age as a nuclear energy provider, and offer crucial relief to makers of nuclear technology starved of new orders in their home countries.
 ''China is the country most likely to have robust growth in nuclear power in the next 10 years,'' said Ron Sinard, who oversees plant development for the Nuclear Energy Institute, a Washington organization that represents the United States industry. ''Looking at the market over the next decade, it's probably the biggest piece of the pie.''
 The call for tenders may be issued as early as this month, nuclear industry executives said. The winner is likely to have an advantage in subsequent bids for 20 or more nuclear plants that may be built by 2020. 
 China currently has eight nuclear power plants that generate a total of 6,200 megawatts; by 2020 nuclear power could provide China with 32,000 megawatts. Even if all the proposed plants are built, nuclear power would supply China with about 4 percent of its electricity needs by 2020, with the bulk of electricity coming from coal-fired stations and, to a lesser extent, hydroelectric projects like the Three Gorges Dam.
 In choosing among rival bids, China will be making choices not only on which technology it will use but also on geopolitical allegiances, environmental safety and, in the case of American bidders, China's gaping trade surplus with the United States.
 ''The stakes are huge. These are big contracts with a lot of implications,'' said Jean-Christophe Delvallet, who represents the French energy company EDR in China.
 In recent months, a procession of political leaders has pressed China to favor power plant designs and equipment from their home countries. They have included President Jacques Chirac of France; former Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada; Viktor Khristenko, who was named fuel and energy minister in Russia on Tuesday; and dozens of less-prominent officials.
 President Bush even raised the virtues of American nuclear technology with the Chinese prime minister, Wen Jiabao, during a meeting in December, said Jim Fici, a senior vice president at Westinghouse, which has long sought to enter China's nuclear energy sector.
 The expense of building nuclear plants -- more than $2 billion for each unit -- may weigh in Westinghouse's favor as China considers big purchases to close its $113 billion trade gap with the United States. 
 When the deputy prime minister of China, Wu Yi, travels to the United States in April to discuss trade disagreements, the sale of American nuclear technology will be on the agenda, according to United States government officials. Westinghouse is based in the United States, but is owned by BNFL, a British company.
 China is likely to shift from its current mixture of Canadian, French and Russian technology to a more uniform array of plants, nearly all the officials and executives interviewed said.
 ''They want a more standardized system,'' said Rene de Preneuf, the chief China representative for Areva, the French-based nuclear energy company. 
 Standardization would make building and running plants less expensive and safer, he said, because it allows equipment, skills and experience to be shared across a wider net. Standardization also means the successful bidder has the lucrative prospect of a run of similar projects.
 Most observers agreed the main contest is between Areva, a company that has long dealt with China and hopes to sell its latest generation of Framatome ER reactors, and Westinghouse, which hopes to sell its AP1000 reactor, a model so new that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has not yet approved it for construction in the United States. 
 This is not the first time China has publicized plans for expanding nuclear energy. Similar plans were announced in the early 1990's but were abandoned because of a slowing economy and a temporary glut in electricity. Energy industry executives and analysts agreed that this time the Chinese government, alarmed by the country's voracious appetite for electricity and growing dependence on imported oil and natural gas, is determined to expand its nuclear energy resources.
 Power shortages that disrupted industrial production across two dozen provinces last year revived interest in nuclear power. Last year electricity demand increased 15 percent to 1.9 trillion kilowatt hours, and tens of thousands of factories in China's eastern provinces were forced to cancel production because of power cuts. Similar power shortages are expected this year and next. The chairman of China's electricity regulation commission, Chai Songyue, said that China would face a shortfall of 20 million kilowatt hours this year.
 Stronger government support for nuclear energy is reinforced by enthusiastic promises of investment for China's power companies.
 ''A lot of utilities are investing money to prepare sites that might be approved in the next five-year plan,'' said Simon Tang, who represents Atomic Energy of Canada in Beijing, referring to China's five-year budget, which will be released next year.
 The booming coastal provinces of Zhejiang and Guangdong are the first in line for nuclear power stations, in part because coal mines and dams are far away, making energy transport a major expense. ''You must look at this at a local basis,'' said Philip Andrews-Speed, an expert on China's energy sector at the University of Dundee in Scotland.
 But energy companies see China as their best potential market. ''Western nuclear suppliers see China as one of their greatest hopes for rekindling their business,'' said Edwin Lyman, a specialist on nuclear energy issues with the Union of Concerned Scientists, a United States group that opposes nuclear energy.
 Economic concerns may outweigh worries about China's role in the spread of nuclear weapons.
 Westinghouse developed the AP1000, which can generate 1,100 megawatts, with half a billion dollars of support from the federal government, and the government would collect tens of millions of dollars in royalties from any such plant in China, a senior United States energy official said. Credit support from the Import-Export Bank may also be used to finance the plants, he said, and Chinese officials had sought assurances that China would receive an export license for the plant.
 The National Reform and Development Commission, China's top energy agency, and Chinese nuclear agencies all declined to be interviewed for this article.
 Critics are concerned that China's leap into nuclear power may test its immature and incomplete regulatory system. Mr. Lyman of the Union of Concerned Scientists said it was not clear how China would ensure that its radioactive materials remained safe, in civilian hands. He said the AP1000 design lacked too many traditional safety backups.
 His concerns were dismissed by proponents of the deal. Mr. Fici, of Westinghouse, said tests showed the AP1000 was many times safer than existing plants. The transfer of the AP1000 technology to China would ''raise no new policy issues'' in proliferation, the United States government official said. The official said he was confident China would abide by United States rules preventing the transfer of licensed nuclear technology to third countries.
 Critics and skeptics of China's nuclear energy program agreed that over the coming years, the shape and speed of its expansion will be at the mercy of economic downturns and political uncertainties.
 ''Now there's a scramble to build as much generation as possible,'' said Mr. Sinton, the analyst. ''But with all this building there's the possibility of overcapacity in a few years' time. There are systemic factors that lead to a boom and bust cycle.''

HEADLINE: Talking Tough on Trade, Or Knowing When to Duck

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 9 

 BODY:
With trade looming as an important issue in the presidential campaign, the normally staid annual Senate hearing on trade policy became a political forum on Tuesday, with Democrats pushing issues supported by their presumptive nominee, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, and Republicans pleading for strong ammunition for their side.
 But the biggest sign offered by the administration about getting tough on trade was the possibility of suing China at the World Trade Organization because of its tax on imported semiconductors -- an issue that has not captured the political imagination.
 Senator Bob Graham, Democrat of Florida, gave the federal government a grade of D, on average, for what he called its poor efforts to keep the United States competitive in the global economy.
 Senator Blanche L. Lincoln, Democrat of Arkansas, who is normally worried about finding foreign markets for her state's rice and cotton crops, raised her party's standard complaint that the administration has to improve labor and environmental standards. 
 Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the Republican chairman of the Finance Committee, said that he was frustrated that Senator Kerry made ''strong comments'' about jobs lost to outsourcing overseas, and Mr. Grassley asked Robert B. Zoellick, the trade representative, to come up with good answers for a rebuttal.
 ''I don't have a single town meeting where something isn't brought up about outsourcing,'' Mr. Grassley said. 
 Mr. Zoellick ducked the question, proving he had learned a lesson from N. Gregory Mankiw, the chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, who caused a firestorm last month by saying losing jobs to outsourcing would work out in the end. 
 Choosing his words carefully, Mr. Zoellick said trade ''involves change, and that can mean difficulties for people.''
 Outsourcing was judged neither good nor bad.
 ''It's a question of dealing with families and anxiety,'' he said. ''But I think the challenge is, How do you help people in a way that doesn't hurt or kill other jobs?''
 Retraining programs, improved education and portable pensions were among Mr. Zoellick's proposed solutions. 
 It was in response to some of those ideas that Senator Graham gave the federal government, and the administration, the average grade of D, particularly, he said, for starving state governments of money they need to finance education.
 In his prepared testimony, Mr. Zoellick made the familiar case that free trade benefits American workers.
 ''Americans can compete with anybody -- and succeed -- when we have a fair chance to compete,'' he said. ''Our goal is to open new markets and enforce existing agreements so that businesses, workers and farmers can sell their goods and services around the world and consumers have good choices at lower prices.''
 But the Republican members of the panel asked Mr. Zoellick for specific proof that the administration could beat back Democrats on trade, picking some of the hottest issues: the trade deficit and China. 
 Senator Craig Thomas, Republican of Wyoming, asked whether the country's record-deep trade deficit would continue climbing.
 Mr. Zoellick said there were other things to worry about and found a way to put the $489 billion trade deficit for 2003 in a positive light.
 ''If you go back and look at the '30s, at the time of the Great Depression, we had a trade surplus,'' Mr. Zoellick said. ''So the surplus or deficit numbers, while they are indicators, I'm not sure should be the prime goal.''
 Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine, brought up China, a country she said was taking away jobs and companies from the United States in violation of international trading rules. 
 ''At what point are we going to be aggressive?'' she asked.
 Mr. Zoellick's answer would not fit easily in a sound bite.
 He said that the administration was considering bringing its first case against China at the World Trade Organization and it ''could be soon.''
 But it would not center on forcing China to allow its currency to float. Ms. Snow and many other members of Congress think the country's fixed exchange rate is undercutting the American economy.
 Rather than take on that issue, which has led to fiery debates on Capitol Hill, Mr. Zoellick said the United States would take China to the W.T.O. because of its tax on semiconductors, which is as much as 14 percent higher on imported computer chips than on those designed or manufactured in China, whether by domestic or foreign companies.

HEADLINE: Kerry Accuses Bush of 'Stubborn,' Not Steady, Leadership

BYLINE: By JODI WILGOREN; David E. Sanger contributed reporting from Virginia for this article.

DATELINE: CHICAGO, March 9 

 BODY:
As he scooped up scores more delegates in four Southern primaries on Tuesday on his march to the Democratic presidential nomination, Senator John Kerry turned one of President Bush's campaign slogans against him, saying his rival had provided ''stubborn,'' not steady, leadership.
 ''He stubbornly insists on tax cuts as he steadily loses jobs in this country,'' Mr. Kerry, playing off the Bush campaign theme ''steady leadership in a time of change,'' told a small audience at a center for the elderly in suburban Evanston. ''He stubbornly refuses to allow the importation of drugs from Canada, while steadily the prices are going up.'' 
 ''I think his stubborn leadership has led America steadily in the wrong direction,'' Mr. Kerry, who is from Massachusetts, added, ''and that's why we're going to vote for change in November.''
 Meanwhile on Tuesday, President Bush, in a veiled swipe at Mr. Kerry's stance on trade, condemned ''economic isolationists,'' and Mr. Kerry, facing only token opposition, swept Democratic contests in Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas.
 The Associated Press reported that with 99 percent of the vote counted in Florida, Mr. Kerry had 77 percent; in Louisiana, with 99 percent of the vote in, he had 69 percent; in Mississippi, with 99 percent of the vote in, he had 78 percent; and in Texas, with 77 percent of the vote in, he had 66 percent.
 Capturing an overwhelming chunk of the 465 delegates in those four states will put nearly 2,000 in Mr. Kerry's column, with the 33 that are up for grabs in the contest Saturday in Kansas and the 156 available here in Illinois on March 16 likely to put him over the 2,162 needed for nomination.
 And so it was an all-but-ignored primary election day, one in which Mr. Kerry visited no polling places, ran no advertisements, expected no congratulatory calls from rivals. The presumptive nominee, who ignores the remaining two Democrats in the race, Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio and the Rev. Al Sharpton, did, however, mark the occasion with a Bush-bashing victory speech here.
 ''Next week Illinois has the opportunity to give me the delegates that actually make me the nominee,'' Mr. Kerry told several thousand supporters here Tuesday night in the historic Union Station downtown. 
 Earlier in Evanston, standing with Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich of Illinois and a couple in their 70's who have taken part-time jobs and are pondering selling the home they have owned for 35 years to pay for $800 a month in medication, Mr. Kerry promised to rescind the Medicare bill passed last year. In its place, he told the Evanston audience, he would put a program allowing the importation of drugs from Canada and permitting states to buy medicine in bulk, reducing costs for consumers and states alike.
 ''I think it's incredible that these people who believe in the free market, who argue about trade all the time and how important it is to have competition, want to shut the market out,'' Mr. Kerry said, referring to the Bush administration. He estimated that reimporting medications would save Illinois alone $91 million a year.
 Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, Republican of Illinois, denounced Mr. Kerry as missing most of the votes on the Medicare bill last fall, and as frightening ''our greatest generation with misinformation'' about the bill.
 Mr. Bush, speaking at a business awards ceremony in Arlington, Va., warned that unnamed ''economic isolationists,'' a term he had previously applied to Mr. Kerry, threatened to block job growth with trade barriers. 
 ''There are economic isolationists in our country who believe we should separate ourselves from the rest of the world by raising up barriers and closing off markets,'' Mr. Bush said at the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Awards for manufacturers and governmental institutions. ''They're wrong.'' 
 He added, 'If we are to continue growing this economy and creating new jobs, America must remain confident and strong about our ability to trade in the world.''
 The White House would not say whom Mr. Bush had in mind, but it seemed clear that he meant Mr. Kerry, who had criticized the president for not enforcing key elements of trade accords, including the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mr. Kerry voted in favor of Nafta and most other major trade pacts, a fact his Democratic rivals had used against him.
 Mr. Bush has been consistently worried about trade and at one point put temporary tariffs on a number of nations that export steel to the United States. But he lifted those tariffs last year, in part because of complaints from American manufacturers who were paying higher prices for imported steel. 
 Even as Mr. Bush trumpeted his free-trade credentials to promise job creation, Mr. Kerry pointed to a new study by the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan research group, saying that tax cuts initiated by the White House had not yielded the promised jobs.
 Mr. Kerry renewed his call for Mr. Bush to face him in monthly debates on individual issues.
 ''It's a very simple fundamental choice,'' Mr. Kerry said at the Evanston senior center, citing Mr. Bush's tax cuts as an example. 
 ''You can either reward George Bush's vision and let him make permanent and give these tax cuts to the wealthiest people in America and forget about prescription drugs and schools and other needs,'' he continued, ''or you can roll back George Bush's tax cuts for the wealthiest people in the country and invest in prescription drugs, education, jobs in America and be more fiscally responsible. That's the choices in this race, as clear as can be.''

HEADLINE: In World Where Talk Doesn't Come Cheap, Former Officials Are Finding Lucrative Careers

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 9 

 BODY:
It's hard to find a bigger fan of the former Bush adviser Karen P. Hughes than the California Grocers Association. In promotional literature for Ms. Hughes's hot new career on the lecture circuit, the association's director gushes that ''your insights and observations about the president, world events, politics and leadership will remain with us for years to come.''
 Truckers like her, too. The American Trucking Associations describe her as ''most gracious'' in sharing her ''expertise in communication and leadership,'' while the Texas Bankers Association said, ''The bankers were wowed by your speech.'' 
 Ms. Hughes is not alone on the high-profile lecture circuit. With the campaign season heating up, former Bush officials, in particular, are in high demand, largely for their fresh insights into the inner workings of the White House. They are the latest to join a long line of former presidents, cabinet members, administration officials and war heroes on the lecture circuit, with many pulling in $40,000 to $50,000 a speech. 
 Besides Ms. Hughes, the new crop on the circuit include Ari Fleischer, the former White House press secretary; Gen. Tommy R. Franks, who led American troops in Afghanistan and Iraq; Christie Whitman, who resigned last May as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency; and Victoria Clarke, the former Pentagon spokeswoman. 
 Ms. Clarke generally makes $20,000 a speech, while Ms. Hughes's fee is $50,000, a person familiar with the contracts said. In just three weeks in January, the person said, Ms. Hughes gave seven speeches, four in a single week.
 ''You let someone know that you are leaving the White House on July 1 and by February you are already booked,'' said Joe Lockhart, the press secretary to President Bill Clinton, who added that his speeches, at $10,000 to $20,000 each, have tapered off from 20 in the first three months after he left the White House to about a dozen a year now. 
 ''Ari is hot right now because people want insights into the Bush White House,'' Mr. Lockhart said. 
 Mr. Fleischer's Web-based promotional material provides a streaming-media version of his basic speech, in which he talks about life close to the president on themes big and small -- ''Boy, did I like Air Force One'' -- as well as what it was like to be traveling with President Bush on Sept. 11, 2001 -- ''It sounds like we've got a war here,'' he recalls Mr. Bush saying on hearing that a plane had crashed into the Pentagon.
 For his part, Mr. Fleischer, who said he has been working ''almost constantly'' since Labor Day on the lecture circuit, said he found speaking a ''natural spot to be if you are not ready to settle into a desk job.''
 He said, ''It's a wonderful way to leave and still share your insights and that excitement with the public.''
 Mrs. Whitman, who sometimes differed with the administration on environmental policies while in office, focuses on safe topics like the virtues of energy conservation. Meanwhile, General Franks gives a spirited defense of Mr. Bush's Iraq invasion. 
 An improving economy, an election year and concerns about war and terrorism are adding up to another banner year for former public officials, according to the agencies that promote them.
 How's business? ''Excellent,'' said Bernie Swain, chief executive of the Washington Speakers Bureau, based in Alexandria, Va., whose roster of 140 speakers includes Mr. Fleischer, former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York and former Secretaries of State Madeleine K. Albright and James A. Baker III. Mr. Swain's company estimated that speakers last year brought in $80 million, of which it took 20 percent to 30 percent in commissions. 
 ''In the pecking order, audiences are looking for celebrity,'' said Don Walker, head of the Harry Walker Agency, which represents Mr. Clinton, former President Gerald R. Ford and, until recently, the first President Bush. Mr. Walker's high-wattage lineup also includes world leaders like former Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan. 
 The top draw on the speaking circuit remains Mr. Clinton, who earned more than $18 million in the last two years for speeches from $100,000 to $400,000 each, according to financial disclosure statements of his wife, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton. Mr. Giuliani estimated in his 2002 divorce filing that he expected to earn $8 million annually from speeches. Former President George Bush, who now acts as his own agent, gives several speeches a year at undisclosed fees, mainly for the Carlyle Group, an investment firm with military contracts that also recently paid to hear General Franks.
 In 2000, the year before he joined the Bush administration, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell earned $6.7 million for slightly over 100 speeches. Still, no one has broken the record set by President Ronald Reagan, who received $2 million for two 20-minute speeches to a Japanese communications company in 1989.
 Charles Lewis, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington nonprofit group that studies money and politics, said that while paid speeches were legal and he understood why former officials gave them, the practice nonetheless ''cheapens public service.'' 
 ''Public officials cash in when they leave,'' he said, ''and we've gotten used to it, whether it's selling potato chips or Viagra or just their celebrity.'' But for former officials like Mr. Lockhart, who now heads the Glover Park Group, a Washington consulting firm, ''it's a completely legitimate way of making money.
 ''To say I'm corrupted by speaking to the top sellers of the Acme Widget Company is absurd,'' he added.
 Many former officials see speech-giving as a way to stay in the public eye and to recoup income after years of lower-paying government service. 
 Mr. Giuliani, who gives more than 200 speeches a year, both paid and free, said in an interview, ''I had to earn a living'' after leaving the mayor's office, which carried a salary of $195,000 a year. 
 ''I enjoy speaking a lot,'' said Mr. Giuliani, who declined to disclose his fees. ''I like meeting people. It was logical. It gave me a chance, too, to travel.'' 
 The Washington Speakers Bureau describes Mr. Giuliani in its promotional material as ''an international icon'' and says audiences are ''still thrilled and moved to hear him speak,'' even two years after the Sept. 11 attacks. 
 Newt Gingrich, the former Republican House speaker, who gives about 35 speeches a year at $40,000 and up, according to his promotional materials, said he expected 2004 to be especially lucrative. 
 ''Presidential years are very good,'' said Mr. Gingrich, whose recent speeches have focused on health care and politics. Besides the intellectual challenge of preparing speeches, Mr. Gingrich admits he also likes the money and the perks. 
 ''Candidly,'' Mr. Gingrich said, ''it pays fairly well.'' With most speaking contracts providing first-class air travel and hotels, it is a pleasant career choice: ''As a general rule, the speeches are given in really nice places, in really nice weather, and it's a nice way to hang out.'' 
 Marlin Fitzwater, who was White House press secretary for the first President Bush, gets $10,000 to $20,000 a speech. 
 ''I love politics and I love talking about it,'' Mr. Fitzwater said. ''I consider myself a lecturer.''
 As for those celebrated speakers who can command $100,000? ''I'm worth that, but I don't get it,'' he said.


CORRECTION-DATE: March 11, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about paid speeches by former government officials misstated the affiliation of Charles Lewis, who said that while he understood why former officials gave them, he believed that the practice ''cheapens public service.'' He is executive director of the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit Washington organization that studies money and politics. He is not associated with the Center for Responsive Politics.

HEADLINE: Hevesi Says New York Gave Tax Breaks That Failed to Create Jobs

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 9 

 BODY:
A state program that doles out millions of dollars in tax breaks to businesses that promise to create jobs in economically struggling areas is poorly managed and has rewarded some companies that actually ended up losing jobs, State Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi charged in an audit released here on Tuesday.
 Among the businesses surveyed that received tax breaks, nearly a quarter lost jobs, the audit found. Forty-seven percent of them created jobs but fell short of what they projected, and 30 percent of them met or exceeded their targets for job creation. The audit studied 8 of the state's 72 economic development zones, which are called Empire Zones. 
 The program is expected to give out $291 million worth of tax breaks this year.
 ''Giving companies tax breaks is giving away real money,'' Mr. Hevesi said in a statement. ''Empire Zone officials must ensure that the tax benefits actually create jobs and healthy companies.''
 The audit findings were hotly disputed by officials at the Empire State Development Corporation, which oversees the program. Charles A. Gargano, the chairman of the corporation, said in a statement that the state has only paid tax benefits for actual jobs created, and not on the basis of projections. But officials in the comptroller's office said they had based their findings on the annual reports filed by the businesses.
 ''It's disappointing that the comptroller chose to issue a political report instead of working with us to improve the program,'' said Chapin Fay, a corporation spokesman.
 The audit found that a Syracuse real estate company created a single job with a salary of $26,000 a year, but claimed tax breaks worth more than a quarter of a million dollars. A Rochester real estate company, the audit found, created one job with a $10,000 annual salary, but received a property tax credit worth $137,000. And it cited several companies that shed jobs but claimed hundreds of thousands of dollars in sales tax exemptions. (Corporation officials said that loopholes allowing such misuse were closed in 2002.)
 The comptroller's audit came as states around the nation are taking a second look at job-creation programs subsidized by government -- known as economic development programs to supporters, and as corporate welfare to their opponents. 
 Some states have paid to build costly plants, only to have the intended tenants walk away and saddle them with the bills. Other states, like New York, rely on tax credits, so they will not lose money when deals fall through. Some critics say that if creating jobs is the goal, tax dollars would be better spent improving transportation, education and infrastructure. 
 New York State is beginning the debate all over again. Its laws authorizing the Empire Zones are due to be phased out later this year, and must be renewed to continue. 
 A proposal by Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, calls for extending the program to 2009 and making changes to the way it works to reduce the potential for abuse. Assembly Democrats called for greater oversight of the program on Monday and charged that the Pataki administration ''has mismanaged the program and it has failed to live up to its potential.'' Senate Republicans are expected to announce their proposal Wednesday; in the past they have called for creating more Empire Zones across the state.
 Mr. Gargano charged in a statement that Mr. Hevesi, a Democrat, was making ''partisan political attacks'' and accused him of having worked in tandem with Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a fellow Democrat. ''These recent accusations are blatant attempts by the comptroller to add credence to the speaker's efforts to hijack the Empire Zone program from the control of local governments,'' Mr. Gargano said in a statement. 
 Mr. Hevesi said in an interview that he plans to do more audits of the program, but said that the audit he released on Tuesday highlights the need for far greater oversight. ''It's a program with potential, it can work and it does work in part, but we've got to tighten the management of it,'' he said. 
 The audit examined the operations of Empire Zones in Binghamton, Buffalo, Islip, Rochester, Syracuse, Tonawanda, Yonkers and the western New York community of Friendship, between 1999 and 2002. It found that the state officials who oversee the program said that the responsibility to manage the zones rested with the local officials in each zone, but that these local officials said that more state oversight was needed.

HEADLINE: Tuition Hits $26,000, and in Private School New York, That's Just for Kindergarten

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS; Lia Miller contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Tuition at New York City's elite private schools is at or near $26,000 for the coming school year, with average increases as high as 9 percent and a growing number of schools charging the same price for kindergarten as for high school.
 Private school families received their contracts -- a euphemism for bills -- in recent weeks and word spread quickly about those with the biggest increases.
 Horace Mann will be charging $26,100 next year, across all grades, plus an additional $3,000 or so for transportation, books and lunch. That is a 7 percent increase for high school but an almost 50 percent increase for kindergarten, which cost $17,500 in 2003-04, before the decision to equalize tuition across all grades. 
 Brearley, which includes all fees in the tuition, will hit $26,200 in the lower grades for the 2004-05 school year and $26,700 in the upper school for an average increase of 8.9 percent, on top of a 7.9 percent increase this year. Marymount's increase was 8 percent, to $24,100, after a 9 percent increase in 2003-04.
 The percentage increases at other Manhattan schools, including Fieldston, Collegiate, Dalton, Trevor Day, Columbia Grammar, Calhoun and Dwight, were lower -- in the 5 percent range -- but all ended up in the same ballpark, with lower school tuitions hovering around $23,000 and upper school around $25,000.
 The schools uniformly attribute the increases to efforts to improve teachers' salaries and benefits, especially in light of a substantial pay increase for the city's public school teachers two years ago and soaring health care costs. And private school parents generally seem to accept that rationale. 
 ''I have a hard time getting mad because these teachers are national treasures,'' said Carol Weston, a writer with two children at Trinity, where tuitions at all grade levels went up 7 percent, to $24,635 in lower school and $26,870 in high school. ''My in-laws are helping a little and there are other ways we cut corners, like parking the car on the street.''
 Corners are also being cut in Careen Shannon's household. Ms. Shannon, an associate in a Midtown law firm with some child support from her ex-husband, is moving from a spacious Park Slope condo to a cramped Upper East Side rental because her 13-year-old daughter, currently at the Berkeley Carroll School in Brooklyn, was accepted for ninth grade at both Brearley and Dalton.
 Ms. Shannon has maxed out her credit cards and borrowed money from her parents to cover moving expenses and the school deposit. ''I make good money,'' Ms. Shannon said, ''but this is still a stretch.''
 Parents who are stretching say they worry how their children will cope with being at the bottom of the socioeconomic heap at school, and are themselves stung by the remarks of wealthier parents. But Victoria Goldman, author of a popular guidebook to the city's private schools, wonders if struggling families shouldn't consider public alternatives.
 ''If you have to sharpen your pencil all that much,'' Ms. Goldman said, ''maybe you shouldn't be in private school. Maybe you're shopping in Bergdorf Goodman when you should be in Old Navy.'' 
 Patrick Bassett, president of the National Association of Independent Schools, said that schools in other parts of the country ''are very concerned that they're approaching, or have already reached, the price break where you begin losing current or prospective customers.'' But in New York City, he said, ''there is no apparent deterioration in demand, no matter what they charge.''
 Still, most private schools here are making new financial aid available, sometimes for families with incomes as high as $175,000. Or they are increasing it, for families already in their schools whose salaries are stagnant or who have lost jobs, and who may have three or four children. Certain schools, Brearley and Fieldston among them, are widely known for their generosity, not only to poor minority students on full scholarship but to middle-class families. 
 Sticker shock in New York City seems worst among parents of children in the lower grades, where tuition was once considerably less than in high school. Horace Mann is the most striking example of an overnight shift to one-price-fits-all. (Horace Mann's tuition figures come from the student newspaper; school officials quoted there did not respond to repeated telephone calls to confirm the figures.) At Marymount, kindergarten cost $20,500 in 2002-03, before tuition was leveled, and next year will cost $24,100, plus nearly $2,000 in fees.
 Most school officials argue that closing the tuition gap between grades, and in some cases eliminating it entirely, is driven by the fact that educating a toddler and a teenager cost the same amount. Another explanation is that the old fee system was based on the postwar corporate structure, where earning capacity increased with age. In the current economy, however, young parents are likely to be paid as well or better than their older counterparts.
 But many people agree that the keen competition for kindergarten seats has most likely influenced the steep price increase at that level. ''It is not off base,'' said Ronnie Jankoff, director of admissions at the Allen-Stevenson School, ''to think part of the equation is supply and demand.''

HEADLINE: A Waiter's Job: At Least It's Staying Here

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''If You're a Waiter, the Future Is Rosy'' (Week in Review, March 7):
 We can bemoan the fact that our economy is producing more waiter and cashier jobs than high-wage manufacturing and information-technology jobs, but wouldn't it be more productive to take steps to ensure that all jobs, even the ''wrong'' jobs, provide a decent standard of living? 
 Raising the minimum wage to a real ''living wage,'' creating a national health care system and reforming our labor laws to strengthen unions would go a long way to improve the lives of millions of working people, even as some jobs move overseas.
 There are millions of jobs, from construction worker to cashier, that cannot be sent abroad. Wages for these workers can be increased without fear that they will lose their jobs to foreign competition. 
 These workers can become the core of a new middle class if we are willing to recognize that a decent life should not be reserved only for those lucky enough to find the ''right'' job.

HEADLINE: Marketers and agencies discuss proposing changes to the way they buy commercial time on networks.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
CRITICISM over how commercial time is bought before the start of the fall television season is leading to what is apparently the first official effort to tackle the issue.
 Robert D. Liodice, president and chief executive of the Association of National Advertisers, said yesterday that members of his organization would meet with their counterparts at agencies that buy commercial time to discuss the difficulties and seek some solutions. The group represents 340 companies that spend $100 billion a year on marketing communications.
 The initiative was announced unexpectedly by Mr. Liodice during a conference in Midtown Manhattan at which the association disclosed results of a membership survey on television advertising. Of respondents who said they take part in the ''upfront'' market, in which advertisers agree to buy commercial time in the spring for the fall season, 56.5 percent described themselves as somewhat or very dissatisfied with the process. 
 And 50 percent of respondents agreed with a statement that the senior managers of their companies ''would support dramatic changes in the upfront'' market.
 The ups and downs of the upfront market have come to be closely watched as proxies for the strength or weakness of the advertising economy. Last spring, the market's strength, as advertisers agreed quickly to buy a record $9.3 billion worth of commercials during the 2003-04 prime-time season, was considered a harbinger of a media marketplace recovery. 
 The complaints from advertisers and agencies about how the upfront market works -- or does not work -- were voiced eloquently in the survey:
 $(6$)They proposed beginning the market in May rather than in the fall, when most marketers have a far better idea of their ad budgets for the coming year.
 $(6$)They also suggested extending the buying and selling period, which can sometimes last less than a week.
 $(6$)They said the negotiating clock should be stopped at a certain hour, rather than let it run all night.
 $(6$)They thought that there should be no drastic changes in the prime-time lineups, which lead to the disappearance of shows that the advertisers had agreed to buy. 
 $(6$)And, they suggested that the networks limit the replacement of scripted series with reality shows, which have less predictable and more potentially objectionable content.
 The effort is to be led by the co-chairwomen of the association's television advertising committee: Perianne Grignon, media services director at Sears, Roebuck & Company in Hoffman Estates, Ill., and Kaki Hilton, vice president for advertising services at Pfizer in New York. They plan to form a subcommittee with members from agencies as well as member companies and, depending on whether antitrust concerns could be overcome, may invite executives from the television networks to join the meetings with the advertisers and agencies. 
 The subcommittee ''fundamentally should include all three'' sides, Mr. Liodice said in an interview after his remarks, which came during the morning session of the association's 2004 Television Advertising Forum at the Marriott Marquis hotel.
 Mr. Liodice's announcement came in response to suggestions from two members of a panel who offered provocative remarks about the shortfalls of the upfront market. The comments were met with loud applause and laughter from the forum audience of more than 400 people that overflowed a ballroom.
 ''We should as an industry, and I'm probably in legal hell here, all get together to wrestle this thing to the ground,'' said one panelist, Jon Mandel, co-chief executive at MediaCom United States in New York and chief global buying officer at MediaCom Worldwide, part of the Grey Global Group, because now ''we're spending the gross national products of entire continents on a whim.''
 ''Now is the time,'' Mr. Mandel said. ''If we miss this opportunity, we miss it forever.''
 The other panelist, David Verklin, chief executive at Carat North America in New York, part of the Aegis Group, said: ''I'm not saying we throw a grenade and blow up the upfront, though I've been accused of that. We need an upfront.''
 Rather, said Mr. Verklin, who has been outspoken in his criticism of the process, his proposed changes -- like shifting the market to the fall from the spring and negotiating only during set hours, perhaps 8 a.m. to 8 p.m -- would improve the process rather than end it.
 Mr. Verklin, in an interview, said he was excited about Mr. Liodice's announcement, adding: ''Forest fires start with a match. This is a start.'' 
 Executives on the selling side of the table, from the networks, offered their perspectives on the panel with Mr. Verklin and Mr. Mandel as well as on a second panel devoted to discussing the survey.
 ''We've spent the last 10 weeks going out and talking to our advertising partners about the network proposition,'' said Mike Shaw, president for sales and marketing at the ABC Television Network in New York, part of the ABC division of the Walt Disney Company, ''and I've yet to have one advertiser tell me they're taking the money away.''
 There were few complaints about the 2001-02 upfront ''when we wrote negatives,'' he added, meaning that advertisers paid less for commercials than they had the year before. ''If you move the upfront to August or September, there would still be advertisers coming to us in May.''
 Joseph Abruzzese, president for advertising sales at Discovery Networks United States in New York, part of Discovery Communications, said he was in favor of limiting the hours for negotiations because ''the sellers make as many mistakes as the buyers late at night.''
 Jon Nesvig, president for sales at the Fox Broadcasting Company in New York, part of the News Corporation, said the round-the-clock bargaining began because competition intensified when the number of broadcast networks increased to six from three. 
 In the three-network era, Mr. Nesvig said, ''you used to go home at night,'' adding that when he worked for one of those networks, his sales colleagues ''were drunk in the afternoon.'' Mr. Mandel of MediaCom then interjected with perfect timing, ''Which is why we did the deals in the afternoon.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: March 12, 2004

 CORRECTION:
The Advertising column in Business Day yesterday, about advertisers' and agencies' criticism of the way they buy commercial time on networks, misstated a finding of a survey of members of the Association of National Advertisers. Respondents proposed beginning the ''up front market'' in the fall, when most marketers have a better idea of their ad budgets for the coming year. (May is the current beginning month.)

United States Trade Deficit Reaches a Record Level
The United States trade deficit climbed to a monthly record of $43.1 billion in January as imports continued to flood in from China and as American exports were hurt by slumping demand from Europe and other parts of the world.
 The new data, released by the Commerce Department, was slightly worse than economists had expected, and intensified the battle over trade and jobs playing out in the 2004 presidential campaign. [Page A1.]

Lawsuits Are Filed to Curb Spam
Four major Internet providers announced that they had filed a series of lawsuits meant to shut down a number of senders of unsolicited junk e-mail, or spam. [A1.]

Target May Sell Two Divisions
The Target Corporation announced that it might jettison both of its department store units: Mervyn's, with 266 stores, and Marshall Field's, the Midwestern chain. Robert J. Ulrich, the chief executive, left, referred to a need to ''identify and evaluate possible strategic alternatives'' for the units, and Goldman, Sachs has been hired by the company. [C4.]

Some See Need for Change at Shell
A growing number of investors in the Royal Dutch/Shell Group are saying that the company may ultimately need to bring in outside executives to restore confidence. [C8.]

Bank of America Unit to Pay Penalty
Banc of America Securities has agreed to pay $10 million to settle claims that it violated laws on record keeping and access requirements, regulators said. [C2.]

Criticism over how commercial time is bought before the start of the fall television season is leading to an official effort to tackle the issue. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [C9.]

Profits Soar at Krispy Kreme
Krispy Kreme said that its fourth-quarter profit nearly tripled. But average weekly sales declined, helping to send the stock lower by 10 percent. The company added 35 stores to its 394 outlets, toward a goal of 1,000 stores in North America by end of the decade. The company said that it is also expanding in Canada, Mexico and Britain. [C7.]

Changing Fortunes of Martin Amis
Martin Amis's last American book deal, with Miramax in 1998, was a major publishing event. But his most recent novel ''Yellow Dog,'' which concluded his American contract, was widely panned and caused barely a ripple in the marketplace. [E1.]

HEADLINE: A Failed Tourney Is Revived

BYLINE: By Alan Truscott

 BODY:
An improving economic picture has been reflected in the world of tournament bridge. Several European events intended for expert fields folded a few years ago when sponsorship failed, but one has now been revived.
 It was staged in Utrecht in the Netherlands at the end of February and was lengthily titled the White House International Top Teams Bridge Tournament. The White House in question is not in Washington but in Amsterdam; it houses several clubs and will be the future home of the tournament. 
 This attracted many world-class players, and the winners were two Poles, Cezary Balicki and Adam Zmudzinski, and two Russians, Andrei Gromov and Aleksandr Petrunin. Two New York experts, Michael Polowan and Chris Willenken, teamed with two other Poles, Apolinary Kowalski and Piotr Tuszynski, and were in contention until a late stage. The diagramed deal was played against them by four Italian world champions.
 Polowan, North, might have raised the opening one-heart bid to game, but he chose to muddy the waters with a forcing response of one no-trump. East eventually bid four spades, which could have been doubled and defeated by at least two tricks for a penalty of 500 or 800. But North-South not unnaturally persevered to five hearts, which presented interesting problems.
 If West had started with a trump, South would have needed to lead the diamond queen at the second trick, preventing West from leading a second trump. But West began with a spade, and Willenken ruffed and led the diamond nine. West won and tabled his remaining spade. South ruffed again, ruffed a diamond and led the club 10 for a losing finesse. (West might have confused the issue by ducking swiftly.)
 After taking his queen, West led the heart 10. South won, ruffed a diamond and returned to his hand with a club lead to ruff his last diamond. He then needed to find the right way to cross to his hand in this position:
 East had signaled to show a doubleton club, so it was clear that his remaining cards were either four spades or three spades and a heart. Willenken decided that East's strong bidding, a double followed by four spades, was much more likely with 6-1-4-2 distribution than with 5-2-4-2. He therefore made the winning play of calling for a club and made his game.
 The same contract failed in the replay, so Willenken's team gained 13 imps.

HEADLINE: Intel to Miss China Deadline On Standard For Wireless

BYLINE: By LAURIE J. FLYNN

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, March 10 

 BODY:
Intel took a hard line on Wednesday in a festering trade dispute with the Chinese government, declaring it would not meet China's June 1 deadline for adhering to its proposed new standard for wireless computing. 
 Intel, the world's leading maker of chips, said the Chinese standard presented substantial technical challenges that would prevent it from meeting Beijing's deadline. Company officials said that they had informed some of Intel's largest customers in China last week that they might need to find an alternate supplier of microprocessors if they want to keep selling wireless products in China after that date.
 Intel's not meeting the Chinese timetable reflects a larger objection on the part of Intel and other American technology companies, which have been up in arms since China announced last year that it wanted to develop a separate national standard for short-range wireless networks, known as Wi-Fi. 
 Last May, Beijing told foreign makers of computers and microprocessors that want to sell Wi-Fi systems in China that they would have to use a different standard for encrypting the signals and work closely with Chinese computer makers to produce goods for the Chinese market.
 Chinese officials had originally set Dec. 1 as the deadline, but late last year extended it to June 1.
 American chip makers and PC manufacturers, joined by a number of other computer makers around the world, say that the Chinese plan amounts to an unfair trade barrier by requiring companies to comply with two vastly different standards. Foreign and American companies are also concerned about the potential loss of intellectual property rights if they are forced to work with Chinese PC companies that might become competitors in the Wi-Fi marketplace.
 An economic counselor at the Chinese Embassy in Washington could not be reached for comment yesterday. But Chinese officials have said in recent months that short-term conflicts can be negotiated.
 In raising the warning flag Wednesday, Intel couched its objections in technical terms. ''We won't be able to build a part that meets our requirements for quality,'' said Chuck Molloy, a spokesman for Intel, which is based in Santa Clara, Calif. But Mr. Molloy said that Intel's problems with the Chinese standard were ''philosophical'' as well. 
 Broadcom, another American supplier of wireless chip sets for PC's sold in China, also said Wednesday that it would not make the deadline. 
 Dell, which sells PC's based on Intel's Centrino wireless chip set, said it did not foresee any disruption in sales of its notebook computers in China if Intel failed to comply with the Chinese standard, known as WAPI.
 ''We have multiple sources in China,'' said Cathie Hargett, a Dell spokeswoman. ''We have alternatives for addressing WAPI compliance should it become necessary.'' She declined to provide any details about Dell's other suppliers. 
 The announcement from Intel came just one week after officials from the Bush administration delivered a letter to China's deputy prime ministers asking them to back off their standards plan. In the letter, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans, and Robert P. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, urged China to work with Washington to resolve the dispute. The administration has not released the letter, but officials have confirmed that it concerns the Wi-Fi standard.
 ''The Chinese should feel very much the pointy end of the stick,'' said Rhett Dawson, president of the Information Technology Industry Council, a Washington trade group representing technology companies. ''They're being told this is a dumb idea.''
 The appeal by the cabinet-level officers, followed by Intel's announcement that it would not meet China's deadline, suggests that the standards dispute is being seen by both Silicon Valley and Washington as the leading edge of a broad array of emerging trade disagreements with China. If China goes ahead with the wireless standard, Mr. Dawson said, it could establish a precedent encouraging Beijing to set more exclusive technical standards.
 American executives and trade officials have expressed fears that such an approach could fragment global markets in high-tech products in what they consider a misguided protectionist attempt by Beijing to give Chinese producers an edge. 
 But some industry analysts note that powerful nations, including the United States, have long exercised power in the global market by setting technical standards. With its huge population and fast-growing economy, China, they say, is merely trying to take its turn as a standard-setter. If the dispute cannot be settled and Intel stops shipments of its wireless chips for PC's to China, the company stands to lose, at least temporarily, access to a huge market for its Centrino chips.
 China is currently the second-largest market for PC's behind the United States, purchasing more than 13 million PC's last year, according to the market researcher IDC.

HEADLINE: Union, but Not Unanimity, As Europe's East Joins West

BYLINE: By JOHN DARNTON

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
When the European Union expands eastward this spring, it will end the 65-year divide caused by the 20th century's hot and cold wars and shift the union from a plush club of 15 like-minded nations into a street bazaar of countries differing in wealth, stature and outlook.
 What is today a tight configuration huddled around France and Germany that seeks to offset American power will on May 1 become an amalgam of 25 highly diverse states, including eight strongly pro-American former Soviet satellites.
 Therein lies a paradox. The new European Union, stretching from the rocky shores of Ireland to Poland's forest border with Ukraine, will be in a better position than ever to serve as a counterweight to the United States. Yet the incoming members look more to Washington than to Berlin and Paris. 
 ''In historical terms it's an extraordinary moment,'' noted Timothy Garton Ash, an Oxford specialist in European studies. ''It's been said that Europe has had a name for 2,500 years but is still in the design stage.
 ''France and Germany have led European integration for 40 years, and now that's clearly over. We have to wrestle with the question of who is going to set the agenda for this huge, sprawling entity of 25 states and 455 million people.''
 Scarred by their postwar existence in the shadow of the Soviet Union, most of the new members bring a different mentality and different habits. They are apt to be suspicious of distant bureaucracy in Brussels, as they were of Moscow, but eager to receive European Union handouts.
 They tend to be idealistic, wanting to spread freedom and oppose totalitarianism, but also cynical about politicians and accustomed to corruption in everyday life.
 ''When we say Europe in Eastern Europe,'' said Andrei Plesu, a former Romanian foreign minister, ''we usually think about something in the past, something we lost and have to regain.
 ''It's something in an old, faded photograph, the world between the two World Wars, a nostalgia, a longing. In the West, Europe is a project. In the East, it's a memory.''
 For both groups it is a bit of a chore.
 In Eastern Europe, the once paradisiacal vision of ''rejoining Europe'' has lost its sheen, whittled down by years of slightly humiliating negotiations to join the union and new fears of being swamped by the powerful West.
 In Western Europe, support for the enlargement is tempered by concerns that the Eastern countries will drain away wealth and jobs, complicating problems of economic stagnation and tensions over illegal immigration. The door is being opened reluctantly, with a shoulder-shrugging sense of noblesse oblige.
 ''We're not in a very good mood right now,'' said Olivier Duhamel, a professor at the Ecole des Sciences Politiques in Paris. ''We're worried about unemployment, immigration and the French identity, and when you put all that together, you fear enlargement. The only people talking about a bigger Europe these days are those talking against it.''
 In the formerly Communist East, the sense of anticlimax is almost palpable. ''Entering the E.U. was always a dream,'' said Maciej Karpinski, a film producer with Polish Television, ''but now that it's here it just doesn't feel substantial.''
 Few people in Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and other new member countries would go so far as to try to slam the door closed. Many still see the advantages -- especially the young, who will now be able to travel to the West more easily -- no passport required, just a quick flash of a national ID card -- and to join student exchange programs.
 But those of working age are particularly bitter that almost all of the 15 current Western members are imposing restrictions to keep out Eastern workers for several years. Others worry that Western products will push their own off the shelves or raise prices or push small-scale local farmers into oblivion.
 As a result, May 1 -- a day for workers observed under Communism with mandatory parades and lackluster banner-waving -- is not likely to see a spontaneous outpouring of celebration. Even some dramatic official plans have fizzled, like one in Warsaw that would have wrapped the skyscraper called the Palace of Culture, infamous as Stalin's gift to postwar Poland, in gold.
 Europeans have waked up to the fears and palpable differences that arise when borders come down, as seen in the unification of East and West Germany, where after more than a decade, disparities in wealth and spirit persist.
 Up to now the belief in Europe was that as in Germany, most economic transformation would flow largely in one direction, from west to east. The unstated assumption was that the 380 million Westerners would be at the helm and that the 75 million Easterners would be lucky enough to be on board.
 But now West Europeans worry that too many Easterners may sink the boat. They envision poor immigrants coming the other way, flooding their cities and burdening their bountiful welfare systems.
 At the same time, the West is apprehensive about the combative mentality displayed by battle-hardened anti-Communist dissidents in many East European elites, and both sides worry about the political schizophrenia of ''old Europe'' and ''new Europe'' that emerged over the war in Iraq.
 Poland, with a history of rebellion and its strong pro-American feelings, made plain at a failed summit conference in December that it does not expect to be treated as a second-class state.
 ''We can't put up with an E.U. in which France and Germany have the final say,'' said Adam Michnik, the former Polish dissident who now runs Gazeta Wyborcza, the major daily. ''And we don't want an anti-American E.U.''
 That position springs, he and many others insist, not from blind lockstep obedience to Washington, but rather from a distinct East European sensibility. 
 Petr Pithart, president of the Senate in the Czech Republic, described it this way: ''Why do we care about solidarity between Europe and the United States? It's the experience of two totalitarian regimes -- the Nazis and the Communists. We're conscious of the fragility of democracy. That sense doesn't exist in Western Europe.''
 In Western Europe, said Jiri Pehe, director of New York University's Prague center, ''it's anti-intellectual to think in a simplistic way about good and evil. Here, we say we know what's good and evil -- it is simple. We've lived under it. We have a less foggy view of the basics.''
 It is of course unclear how long Eastern Europeans will cling to their cold war vision of the United States as the gravitational center of the West. 
 As long as they do, the scales of loyalty are likely to tip toward the Atlantic alliance so fundamental to British governments of the last 50 years. Yet most believe that those differences will eventually melt away, much as they have as Western Europe knits itself ever closer together.
 ''Geography will triumph over history,'' declared Tony Judt, a Europe specialist at New York University. ''It will eventually matter more to the Eastern Europeans to be in the favor of Brussels, because day to day they will need Brussels.''
 Dennis MacShane, Britain's minister for Europe, observed: ''The great fallacy is that as Europe gets bigger, somehow it gets more disintegrated. The evidence is that every new previous enlargement has been followed by the need for more sharing of sovereignty and someone to set the rules in Brussels.''
 Over time, too, the union's voluminous codification of laws and standards, some 80,000 pages long, may wear down Eastern Europe's rough edges, fostering political stability and reducing ingrained corruption.
 An unknown factor here is the United States foreign policy. Officially and historically, Washington is on record as favoring a strong and united Europe, but what if the Continent becomes a monolithic competitor in economics and foreign policy?
 Already there are divisions over the delicate question of whether the union should admit Turkey, a country of 70 million. Washington is pressing for admission on the ground that Turkey is a NATO member and a secular democracy that needs to find stability in the arms of Europe.
 Europeans are deeply split over the question. Some say it would be impossible to conceive of a governing structure that could accommodate, say, Turkey and Germany, countries with comparable size of population but hugely different levels of development.
 Others say opening the door to millions of Islamic immigrants -- in addition to the millions of Muslims that Europe is already struggling to absorb -- is asking for trouble because it will set off religious and ethnic feuding and provide fodder for far-right movements.
 For some the question boils down to an often fruitless attempt to fix Europe's natural boundaries. For others it becomes an effort to define what it means to be a European. 
 Quickly, such conversations turn to intangibles, to talk of the Renaissance, the Enlightenment and definitions offered centuries earlier by Dante and Voltaire. Some talk of a feeling of belonging that overcomes them in a Central European coffeehouse or of alienation when they visit the United States.
 ''It's paradoxical,'' Mr. Pehe said. ''Here I'm a Czech. But when I go to the U.S., I'm looked at as a European, and then I feel I'm a European. It's one of those concepts that you see better from the outside.''

HEADLINE: The Great Indian Dream

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: BANGALORE, India 

 BODY:
Nine years ago, as Japan was beating America's brains out in the auto industry, I wrote a column about playing a computer geography game with my daughter, then 9 years old. I was trying to help her with a clue that clearly pointed to Detroit, so I asked her, ''Where are cars made?'' And she answered, ''Japan.'' Ouch.
 Well, I was reminded of that story while visiting an Indian software design firm in Bangalore, Global Edge. The company's marketing manager, Rajesh Rao, told me he had just made a cold call to the vice president for engineering of a U.S. company, trying to drum up business. As soon as Mr. Rao introduced himself as calling from an Indian software firm, the U.S. executive said to him, ''Namaste'' -- a common Hindi greeting. Said Mr. Rao: ''A few years ago nobody in America wanted to talk to us. Now they are eager.'' And a few even know how to say hi in proper Hindu fashion. So now I wonder: if I have a granddaughter one day, and I tell her I'm going to India, will she say, ''Grandpa, is that where software comes from?'' 
 Driving around Bangalore you might think so. The Pizza Hut billboard shows a steaming pizza under the headline ''Gigabites of Taste!'' Some traffic signs are sponsored by Texas Instruments. And when you tee off on the first hole at Bangalore's KGA golf course, your playing partner points at two new glass-and-steel buildings in the distance and says: ''Aim at either Microsoft or I.B.M.''
 How did India, in 15 years, go from being a synonym for massive poverty to the brainy country that is going to take all our best jobs? Answer: good timing, hard work, talent and luck.
 The good timing starts with India's decision in 1991 to shuck off decades of socialism and move toward a free-market economy with a focus on foreign trade. This made it possible for Indians who wanted to succeed at innovation to stay at home, not go to the West. This, in turn, enabled India to harvest a lot of its natural assets for the age of globalization.
 One such asset was Indian culture's strong emphasis on education and the widely held belief here that the greatest thing any son or daughter could do was to become a doctor or an engineer, which created a huge pool of potential software technicians. Second, by accident of history and the British occupation of India, most of those engineers were educated in English and could easily communicate with Silicon Valley. India was also neatly on the other side of the world from America, so U.S. designers could work during the day and e-mail their output to their Indian subcontractors in the evening. The Indians would then work on it for all of their day and e-mail it back. Presto: the 24-hour workday.
 Also, this was the age of globalization, and the countries that succeed best at globalization are those that are best at ''glocalization'' -- taking the best global innovations, styles and practices and melding them with their own culture, so they don't feel overwhelmed. India has been naturally glocalizing for thousands of years.
 Then add some luck. The dot-com bubble led to a huge overinvestment in undersea fiber-optic cables, which made it dirt-cheap to transfer data, projects or phone calls to far-flung places like India, where Indian techies could work on them for much lower wages than U.S. workers. Finally, there was Y2K. So many companies feared that their computers would melt down because of the Year 2000 glitch they needed software programmers to go through and recode them. Who had large numbers of programmers to do that cheaply? India. That was how a lot of Indian software firms got their first outsourced jobs.
 So if you are worried about outsourcing, I've got good news and bad news. The good news is that a unique techno-cultural-economic perfect storm came together in the early 1990's to make India a formidable competitor and partner for certain U.S. jobs -- and there are not a lot of other Indias out there. The bad news, from a competition point of view, is that there are 555 million Indians under the age of 25, and a lot of them want a piece of ''The Great Indian Dream,'' which is a lot like the American version.
 As one Indian exec put it to me: The Americans' self-image that this tech thing was their private preserve is over. This is a wake-up call for U.S. workers to redouble their efforts at education and research. If they do that, he said, it will spur ''a whole new cycle of innovation, and we'll both win. If we each pull down our shutters, we will both lose.''

HEADLINE: We Interrupt This Search To Show a Full-Motion Ad

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
IF you missed the commercials served up 80 million times recently in the Internet's biggest test of television-style video ads, stay tuned -- or beware. Encouraged by the initial results, advertisers have begun a new round. 
 An online survey of 1,700 Internet users who saw the full-motion commercials, which ran from late January until late February, showed that viewers found them less annoying than some marketers had expected. Indeed, just 28 percent found them annoying -- compared with 38 percent of TV viewers, on average, who found commercials annoying in three separate studies. The survey on Web commercials was paid for by the advertisers. 
 ''I was astounded by the results,'' said Judy Gern, who directs the online ad campaigns of the Internet phone company Vonage for the interactive division of Carat, a media company. ''There's absolutely no question we'll be doing this again.'' 
 The Vonage ads were similar to others in the test, in that the company simply took video that had run on television and placed it on about.com, www.espn.com and other Web sites. 
 The ads rely on technology that invisibly loads the video while readers browse through a site, then runs the commercial at 30 frames a second -- the same speed as TV -- in a window that occupies most of the browser space. Users can also close the ad.
 In addition to Vonage, the advertisers included Honda, Warner Brothers, AT&T and Pepsi.
 While marketers have increasingly used so-called streaming video to run ads online in recent years, advertisers and Web site executives say the experience is choppier and more prone to glitches than the full-motion ads, which use technology created by Unicast, a New York-based online advertising company. Other sites, like ESPN's, had previously used full-motion ads but in smaller formats requiring special software.
 The online survey, conducted by the advertising research firm Dynamic Logic, found that video commercials vastly outperform conventional online ads on measures like brand awareness and purchase intent. 
 Unicast said last week that several Internet publishers, including www.weather.com and www.forbes.com, would be joining those accepting the video commercials.
 James Nail, an analyst with the technology consultancy Forrester Research, noted that more than 30 percent of those who watched the video commercials viewed most or all of the them, nearly even with the 35 to 40 percent who watch most of a typical TV commercial. ''I didn't expect consumers to have as much patience online as they do with TV,'' Mr. Nail said.
 But Web publishers are not yet prepared to try the users' patience. Although they can charge up to three times as much for these ads than static Internet ads, some Web site executives say they will only show one such ad daily to their Internet users.
 ''It's such a disruptive moment,'' said James Spanfeller, chief executive of Forbes.com. ''You've basically asked to go to a Web page and all of a sudden you're not there. There's no science to the frequency cap, though. It's more that we think it's the right thing to do.''

HEADLINE: Death Wish

BYLINE: By Mary Roach. 
Mary Roach is the author of ''Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers.''

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
Because I've written about the cadavers used in medical research, I am frequently asked if I plan to become one. While I haven't yet signed the forms, I find the idea appealing. I'm an altruistic sort, but more than that I'm cheap -- and the thousands of dollars in savings on funeral expenses is hard to pass up. 
 What's more, being carved into bits and chunks and shipped to a dozen different universities and institutions seems no more distasteful than decomposing in the dark underground or being burned to char in a crematory retort. I'm all for post-mortem adventure and travel. (I'm told that if you donate your brain to the Harvard Brain Bank, for instance, it rides up front in the cockpit on the plane to Boston.)
 I'm happy to donate my body to science as long as no one profits from my parts. But this wish is becoming increasingly difficult to safeguard now that body parts are hot property. Just last week, the director of the cadaver research program at the University of California, Los Angeles, was arrested and accused of selling donated body parts to medical researchers elsewhere.
This raises the question: is compensation for bodies or their parts such a bad idea? Leaving one's body to science has historically been an act of pure generosity, but if the human tissue shortage is so dire that biotechnology companies and medical researchers are resorting to black market purchases, then maybe the system should be rethought. It's my body, and if anyone is going to make money from it, it should be me or my family. Perhaps a modest financial incentive for donating one's remains to medical research will inspire more people to do it.
 Bear in mind, this is different from offering money for organs to be used in transplants. Doing that runs the risk that impoverished individuals may be tempted -- or pressured -- to sell a kidney for cash even if it's dangerous for their health. There's also the possibility that families of brain-dead patients, the source of most organs for transplants, could make decisions that are unduly affected by the prospect of payment. But compensating the future dead, or their families, poses no such risk, although some precautions should be in order, like fingerprinting before and after death to ensure that the dead body in the box was the same as the living body that signed the donor form.
 But basically, I take a utilitarian stance. I'm not going to be using my body once I'm dead, so if some good can come of parceling it out for medical research, I'm all for it. And if a reasonable cash outlay is all it takes to get 10,000 or 20,000 Americans over their aesthetic qualms and into my camp, then everybody wins. Everybody except the funeral industry, and it has been winning long enough.

HEADLINE: With free trade, what goes abroad usually finds its way back, to everyone's benefit.

BYLINE: By Hal R. Varian. 
Hal R. Varian is a professor of business, economics and information management at the University of California at Berkeley.

 BODY:
THE Jan. 31 issue of The Economist described the consequences of high-tech jobs moving overseas.
 According to the story, ''with the trans-Atlantic shift in R&D goes many high-value jobs, as well as a greater share of the industry's profits.'' This trend has led to an ''increasing concern'' in the industry, with some executives speaking out against the outsourcing trend.
 Old news, you might say. The press is filled with articles about high-tech jobs being outsourced to India. 
 The twist here is that the article is about biotech research jobs being outsourced to the United States from Europe. But the language is eerily familiar: replace ''biotech'' with ''infotech'' and switch the roles of Europe and America and this story could pass for yet another Silicon Valley requiem.
 Articles like this should remind us that trade is a two-way street.
 The money paid to foreign producers, whether businesses or workers, typically comes back home to buy domestic goods and services, thereby generating domestic employment. That is true whether it is European companies paying American biotech researchers, or American companies paying Indian programmers.
 Think about it. If Oracle sends $10,000 abroad to pay an Indian programmer, then that money either finds its way back to the United States or it doesn't. If it comes back, it can be used to buy American goods and services, employing American workers. If it doesn't come back then it's even better from the viewpoint of the country: we've sent them paper, while they've sent us valuable goods and services.
 Yes, these days it's more likely bits than paper, and maybe they are sending us more services than goods. And perhaps the way the money comes back is via a purchase of Treasury bonds or other financial securities.
 But the same principle applies. If the income from the Treasury bonds is used to buy something produced in the United States, it creates jobs. If the money is never spent in the United States, we've gotten something for nothing.
 The political problem with trade is simply this: when the dollars flow offshore, it is easy to identify those who are hurt. But when the dollars flow back, it is much more difficult to discern the beneficiaries.
 Look at farmers, for example. Stimulated by the decline in the dollar, American agricultural exports are forecast to grow to $59 billion this year, $2.8 billion more than last year, despite the dip reported yesterday. Farm income is up, too, and would be even higher if not for the drop in beef exports because of mad cow fears.
 Despite this surge in nonbeef agricultural exports, you do not see farmers demonstrating in favor of free trade. American biotech workers are doing pretty well, too, as the opening example illustrates. But how many of those farmers or technicians attribute their good fortune to foreign trade?
 Those who gain from trade either do not know it, or keep quiet about it, for obvious reasons. It's not prudent to brag about your good fortune while others are losing their jobs.
 But isn't there something special about trade in services? Well, no. Services have always been traded internationally. In fact, they now account for about 30 percent of the value of all American exports. Last year, the United States had a $550 billion trade deficit for goods, but a $60 billion surplus on the service side.
 Today, modern communications technology offers a whole new set of opportunities for trade in services.
 Imagine a world where American workers could subcontract production to foreign workers on their own. Paul could send an e-mail message with his programming assignments to Avinash every morning and receive the completed work back in the afternoon. In exchange, Paul would buy a money order for one-tenth of his salary each month and send it to Avinash.
 Paul could take on another job, earning more money, or he could just take it easy. Sound like a good deal for Paul? Of course it is: he would jump at the chance to subcontract on those terms.
 Even though Paul would hire Avinash to do his job if he could capture the wage difference himself, Paul would still be understandably upset if his employer laid him off and outsourced his job to Avinash.
 This thought experiment illustrates that the debates about trade are not about whether we should accept those good deals offered to us by cheap foreign labor -- of course we should. The debate is all about who will capture the benefits from those deals and who will bear the costs.
 Ideally, those who benefit the most from trade would compensate those who lose. In practice, virtually everyone benefits to some degree from cheaper goods and services, so compensation for those who lose from trade should come from general revenues.
 The United States has, with some exceptions, been a champion of free trade. It would be a huge step backward to move toward protectionist policies.
 In the next decade, this country will need more foreign workers, whether they live here or abroad. In a few years we will see a large fraction of the work force disappear as the baby boomers start to retire. Yet, those retirees expect to consume just about as much during retirement as they do now.
 Who will produce all those goods and services?
 In the near future the United States will have to find ways to produce more with less domestic labor. That means increased productivity growth, to get more output from the workers we do have, and expanded international trade, using all that cheap foreign labor.
 As the population ages, expanding health care costs will trump domestic employment concerns. An inexpensive X-ray analysis from a Bangalore radiologist will be viewed as every American's right -- paid for by Medicare, of course.
 It is inevitable (but no less depressing) that outsourcing will become a major topic of the election year oratory. Let us hope that the short-run antitrade posturing doesn't get in the way of the long-run interests of the country.

HEADLINE: DEFICIT IN TRADE TOPS $43 BILLION, MONTHLY RECORD

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS and ELISABETH BUMILLER; Edmund L. Andrews reported from Washington for this article and Elisabeth Bumiller from Cleveland.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 10 

 BODY:
The United States trade deficit climbed to a monthly record of $43.1 billion in January as imports continued to flood in from China and American exports were hurt by slumping demand from Europe and other parts of the world.
 The new data, released Wednesday by the Commerce Department, was slightly worse than economists had expected and intensified the battle over trade and jobs playing out in the 2004 presidential campaign.
 Trade analysts said the deficit widened in January in part because of higher prices for imported oil and a drop in meat exports that was tied to fears about a case of mad cow disease in Washington State. Exports of meat and poultry in January dropped by 40 percent, to $379 million, the lowest since November 1993.
 But the latest numbers also pointed to more enduring trade problems. The flood of products from China, which had a trade surplus with the United States of $124 billion last year, climbed by $1.6 billion in January compared with January 2003. 
 Analysts said the new trade report revealed more about the economic weakness in Europe than about the inability of American companies to compete. Imports and exports declined in January, but exports fell more, leading to a 0.9 percent increase in the overall trade deficit, to $43.1 billion in January from $42.7 billion in December. The previous record was $43 billion last March.
 American exports to Europe stagnated for the third month in a row, even though the value of the dollar plunged against that of the euro last year. A weak dollar should bolster American exports because it makes American products cheaper abroad. 
 But China has kept its currency locked at a fixed exchange rate to the dollar and European consumer demand has yet to revive from the slowdown of the last few years.
 ''The real problem is that our trading partners are only beginning to recover, so U.S. export growth has really been flat,'' said James Glassman, a senior economist at J.P. Morgan Chase. 
 Though the United States has been running trade deficits for many years, the gap between exports and imports has widened sharply over the last few years and reached an annual record of $489.4 billion in 2003 -- 4.5 percent of the nation's gross domestic product, up from 4 percent in 2002 and 1.9 percent in 1990.
 Many economists say the widening trade gap is at least partly responsible for the weakness of the American job market. The Labor Department reported last week that job creation came to a near standstill last month, and the economy has lost about 2.2 million jobs since January 2001.
 In addition to the effect on jobs, the trade deficit has also led to a huge increase in overall United States indebtedness to the rest of the world. The nation's net foreign obligations, which include debt and the claim on American profits by foreign investors, are equal to more than one-quarter of total American output.
 The president's latest economic report said that foreign investment in stocks, bonds, factories and funds in the United States had largely balanced the trade deficit, but some economists said this could soon change. 
 China's trade surplus with the United States is larger than that of any other country, including the entire European Union. 
 In Congress, Democratic and Republican lawmakers have been pushing President Bush to challenge China's trade practices much more aggressively than he has and to pressure China to let its currency, the yuan, rise in value against the dollar. That would make goods made in China, including those manufactured for American companies, more expensive in the United States and would make American goods easier to buy in China.
 President Bush and his likely Democratic challenger, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, spent the day trading accusations over outsourcing, the shifting of American jobs to China and other countries with lower costs, a serious political problem for Mr. Bush.
 In Cleveland, Mr. Bush fiercely defended his trade policies in a tough new speech that hit hard at Mr. Kerry as a gloomy protectionist who would isolate the nation from the rest of the world. 
 ''There are people who doubt our ability to compete,'' Mr. Bush told a forum of female entrepreneurs at the Cleveland Convention Center, without mentioning his likely Democratic opponent by name. ''There are economic isolationists who surrender and wall us off. It's bad for the economy, bad for consumers. It's bad for workers. We'll prove the pessimists wrong again.''
 In Chicago, Mr. Kerry accused the president of callously ignoring the plight of American workers whose jobs have been moved to nations like India.
 ''George Bush will fight like hell to keep his own job, but he won't lift a finger to help Americans keep theirs,'' Mr. Kerry said by satellite to a meeting of A.F.L.-C.I.O. leaders in Florida. ''George Bush thinks exporting our jobs is good economic policy. I believe we need to create and keep good jobs here and export goods.''
 In his speech in Cleveland, Mr. Bush defined Mr. Kerry in the most extreme terms, even as he agreed with Mr. Kerry about the problem of outsourcing in Ohio, a state that Mr. Bush won in 2000 but that the Democrats are forcing him to defend vigorously in 2004. The president also took the unusual step of publicly acknowledging that Ohio's unemployment rate, 6.2 percent, ''is higher than the national average,'' which is 5.6 percent. Ohio has lost more than 265,000 jobs since Mr. Bush took office.
 ''I know there are workers here concerned about jobs goings overseas,'' Mr. Bush said. ''I understand that.'' 
 But Mr. Bush said the solution in what he called a ''time of transition'' was not trade barriers or the higher taxes proposed by his opponents. ''They never get around to explaining how higher taxes would help create a single job in America -- except maybe at the I.R.S.,'' Mr. Bush said, to applause. ''They don't explain how closing off markets, closing off markets abroad, would help the millions of Americans who produce goods for export, or work for foreign companies right here in the United States.''
 Mr. Bush then marshaled statistics that cast a sunny picture of free trade and its benefits for American workers. He said, for example, that 16,000 Ohioans worked for Honda, and that 6.4 million other Americans drew paychecks from foreign countries. ''Economic isolation would lead to retaliation from abroad, and put many of those jobs at risk,'' he said.
 Mr. Bush offered as solutions to outsourcing more job training and education for American workers. Mr. Kerry has proposed a waiting period before American companies move jobs overseas, and has said he would place the North American Free Trade Agreement and other trade pacts under a 120-day review to see if they are fair to the United States. He has never said he was opposed to free trade.
 The White House and Mr. Kerry also tangled over the pending appointment of a manufacturing czar, Tony Raimondo, a business executive from Columbus, Neb., who spent his day in the political cross-fire.
 The Kerry campaign, seeking to undercut Mr. Bush, announced Wednesday afternoon that the White House planned to appoint Mr. Raimondo on Thursday as an assistant secretary of commerce for manufacturing, a position that Mr. Bush promised with great fanfare on Labor Day. But the Kerry campaign also said that Mr. Raimondo's company, a manufacturer of steel buildings and agriculture equipment, had laid off American workers and was building a factory in Beijing.
 ''Putting another bureaucrat in the Department of Commerce is not going to get people back to work,'' Mr. Kerry said in a statement. ''This is like the quarterback losing late in the fourth quarter, promising he can win the game by hiring a new water boy.''
 The Commerce Department responded by abruptly postponing a news conference scheduled for 9:30 a.m. on Thursday that was planned for the announcement of Mr. Raimondo's appointment. But a Bush administration official said late Wednesday that Mr. Raimondo remained ''under serious consideration'' and that his company, Behlen Manufacturing Company, had not shifted any of its American jobs to China.

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Americas: Canada: Exports Decline

BYLINE: By Bernard Simon (NYT)

 BODY:
Canada's exports shrank 4.7 percent in January, largely as a result of a decline in shipments of motor vehicles and parts to the United States, Statistics Canada reported. With imports also falling, the over all trade surplus dipped fractionally to 5.2 billion Canadian dollars ($3.93 billion). The decline in exports was the biggest in nine months, leading some analysts to forecast that the Bank of Canada will lower interest rates next month for the third time this year as a way of putting a brake on the strong Canadian dollar and making exports more competitive.

HEADLINE: New Haitian Prime Minister Arrives, Vowing to Restore Unity

BYLINE: By LYDIA POLGREEN

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, March 10 

 BODY:
Gerard Latortue, the economist and former diplomat chosen by a United States-backed council to lead Haiti out of its political crisis, arrived in the country from southern Florida on Wednesday, promising to reconcile bitterly opposed factions and bring peace and prosperity to a nation long wracked by poverty and brutalized by generations of dictators. 
 ''I come with all my impartiality, with no political party,'' Mr. Latortue said at a hotel in Port-au-Prince. ''I come to work with all Haitians.'' 
 His arrival was the clearest sign yet that a new Haitian government was beginning to take shape as the nation continued to struggle to right itself after the departure of Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Haiti's first democratically elected president. With armed rebels menacing the capital and with the United States and other nations pressuring him to step down, Mr. Aristide fled for exile in Africa on Feb. 29.
 Mr. Latortue said he would appoint Herard Abraham, a former general who has wide support and was one of three top candidates to be prime minister, as the head of the nation's security, a move likely to placate armed rebels, many of whom were members of the Haitian Army before it was disbanded by Mr. Aristide. 
 Mr. Latortue fled Haiti in the late 1960's, when he faced political persecution from the Duvalier regime, and he returned only for brief spells. During one, in 1988, he served as foreign minister in the civilian government of Leslie Manigat, whose administration was ended by a coup after just four months. He worked for a United Nations agency for decades and is a business consultant. 
 He replaces Yvon Neptune, a stalwart of Mr. Aristide's Lavalas Party who stayed on after Mr. Aristide fled to help smooth the transition to a new government. Under Haiti's Constitution, the prime minister is in charge of running the government, but under Mr. Aristide, virtually all authority rested in the president's National Palace. 
 The interim president, Boniface Alexandre, a justice on Haiti's Supreme Court, will serve in a largely symbolic role. 
 Mr. Latortue's arrival drew mixed responses across the city. Leslie Voltaire, a close adviser to Mr. Aristide and a top government minister, said that Mr. Latortue's reputation -- for honesty and technocratic skills -- was beyond reproach. 
 ''He is neutral and independent,'' Mr. Voltaire said. ''He has no political constituency. He is not going to have a vested interest in any party.''
 A spokesman for the political opposition to Mr. Aristide, Micha Gaillard, called Mr. Latortue ''a real professional and a man of integrity'' but said he had lived outside of Haiti for too long. 
 In La Saline, a vast slum in the capital and a stronghold of support for Mr. Aristide, Mr. Latortue's name barely registered. 
 ''We don't know who he is,'' said Ernseau Bolivar, a student. ''We want Aristide back.'' 
 On Wednesday, American marines shot and killed two Haitian men who had fired at them from atop a building near the prime minister's house, said a military spokesman, Maj. Richard A. Crusan. That brought the total number of Haitians killed since foreign troops arrived here Feb. 29 to four.

HEADLINE: A.F.L.-C.I.O. Plans to Spend $44 Million to Unseat Bush

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: BAL HARBOUR, Fla., March 10 

 BODY:
The A.F.L.-C.I.O., long one of the biggest players in presidential politics, announced its most ambitious, most expensive campaign effort on Wednesday, a $44 million program aimed at unseating President Bush.
 The labor federation plans to urge its 13 million members to vote for Senator John Kerry, the expected Democratic presidential nominee, and will make a special effort to focus on union members who are swing voters. Also for the first time, organized labor will seek to persuade and mobilize hundreds of thousands of nonunion members to vote for labor's preferred presidential candidate.
 ''America's unions are united for the biggest and earliest mobilization effort for the 2004 elections in the union movement's history,'' said John J. Sweeney, the federation's president. 
 After the nation's unions clashed over which candidate to endorse in the Democratic primaries, labor leaders attending the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s winter meeting here said on Wednesday that there was unusually strong unity behind Mr. Kerry. In speech after speech, union leaders said Mr. Kerry was a friend of working Americans, while Mr. Bush favored the rich.
 ''Our members are excited and unified as never before, and they're ready to mobilize and make a difference in this election,'' said Karen Ackerman, the federation's political director.
 In a 15-minute address, Mr. Kerry spoke to the labor leaders by satellite from a factory in Chicago. He said Mr. Bush had presided over three years of job losses and had done nothing to stop American jobs from going overseas. He accused Mr. Bush of crony capitalism and called for cutting taxes for the middle class and reversing tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.
 ''Rain or shine, surplus or deficit, George Bush's economic prescription begins and ends with tax giveaways for those with special pull and special influence,'' Mr. Kerry said. 
 At a news conference at an oceanfront hotel, Mr. Sweeney announced that labor leaders had approved a 4-cent-a-month assessment on the federation's members, which would increase its political war chest to $44 million, an amount Mr. Sweeney said would be dwarfed by corporate political spending. The federation will mostly spend the money on political education for union members and getting out the vote.
 In the 2000 presidential campaign, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. spent $41 million on politics in seeking to elect Al Gore. Sixty-three percent of union members backed Mr. Gore and 32 percent Mr. Bush. That year, 26 percent of all voters came from union households.
 Union leaders said they hoped an even higher percentage of voters would come from union households this year. For the first time, they said, unions will seek to persuade not just union members to vote for their presidential candidate, but everyone in the members' household, including spouses, parents and voting-age children.
 Unions also plan to make a special effort regarding the 25 percent of union members they view as swing voters. Labor strategists said they would identify these workers through voter-registration records and other means. Once the swing voters are identified, other union members will telephone them and talk with them at work about issues like Mr. Bush's effort to eliminate overtime pay for many workers.
 In another new effort, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. will seek to mobilize up to one million Americans who do not belong to unions. Traditionally, union political efforts are limited by law to just unionized workers and members of their households. But the labor federation has started a new group, Working America, that is signing up nonunion workers as associate members who will join unions in matters like raising the minimum wage and political campaigns. 
 Karen Nussbaum, the executive director of Working America, predicted that the group, which has 100,000 members, would expand by the end of the year to one million.
 Many labor leaders say the stakes are huge because they fear that if Mr. Bush is re-elected, he will move more aggressively to weaken unions. 
 ''This is the most important election indeed in our lifetime,'' said Gerald McEntee, chairman of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s political committee and president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.

HEADLINE: Chavez Says U.S. Is Fueling His Enemies

BYLINE: By JUAN FORERO

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, March 10 

 BODY:
Under United States pressure to allow a recall referendum against his rule, President Hugo Chavez has in recent days counterattacked, charging that the Bush administration is trying to oust him by aiding his adversaries, including those who briefly overthrew him in a 2002 coup.
 Mr. Chavez has seized on the information in reams of United States government documents, made public by a pro-Chavez group in New York that show Washington is trying to strengthen political parties and other antigovernment groups that want to remove the populist firebrand through a recall.
 Aid to opposition groups by the National Endowment for Democracy, a nonprofit agency financed by the United States Congress, is not new. Nor is the $1 million spent here last year excessively high for an organization that spends $40 million a year to finance hundreds of organizations in 81 countries. 
 But the unearthing of 2,000 pages of documents has provided details of how the Bush administration considers the rehabilitation of Venezuela's battered political parties the best way to counter a leader Washington views as erratic and authoritarian.
 ''The future of Venezuelan democracy depends on the rebuilding of healthy and responsive political parties that can effectively channel citizen demands,'' says one memo.
 Mr. Chavez has lashed out in three recent speeches, telling Washington to ''get its hands off Venezuela'' and charging that the Bush administration is ''financing this mad opposition.'' He has even gone so far as to threaten to cut off oil exports if Washington gets the ''idea of trying to blockade Venezuela, or, even worse, of invading Venezuela.''
 Relations between the two countries are at their worst since the April 11, 2002, coup, when the White House blamed Mr. Chavez for his own downfall. Bush administration officials were embarrassed when Mr. Chavez was swept back into power in an uprising two days later.
 Anti-Chavez groups have abandoned a strategy of general strikes and are focusing on a referendum. 
 On March 2, the National Electoral Council temporarily disqualified hundreds of thousands of signatures the opposition needed to allow a vote. But opposition groups and diplomats who monitored the signature-gathering say that more than a million signatures were arbitrarily disallowed.
 For the United States, which is dependent on Venezuelan oil supplies and has close economic ties to the country, the possibility that the referendum could be scrapped would be a serious blow to a carefully calibrated policy aimed at building feasible political alternatives to Mr. Chavez.
 The endowment documents say that ''strengthening political parties remains a critical part of any long-term solution'' and that the ''battered political party system is the only institution capable of restoring democracy by generating solidly democratic leaders and generating sound policies.''
 Endowment aid had fallen to $257,000 in 2000, as political parties and other beneficiaries in Venezuela were left crippled after Mr. Chavez's sweeping victories in elections. Assistance more than tripled to $877,000 in 2001 as political parties reorganized to counter the president. In 2002, aid rose again, to $1.1 million.
 Chris Sabatini, the endowment's director for Latin America, said the agency's goal was to promote democracy. In a phone interview from Washington, he said the endowment had worked in Venezuela with civic groups without political ties, including conflict resolution teams and organizations defending human and civil rights. The endowment's aid to political groups is aimed at strengthening them ''to build political space'' and calm the shrill political debate in this deeply divided country, he said.
 The documents, obtained by a freelance reporter, Jeremy Bigwood, and posted on the Web site of the Venezuela Solidarity Committee, show that much of the aid benefits political parties and groups leading the recall effort. Those benefiting from assistance include Sumate, a group that has staged signature gatherings for a referendum. It received $53,400 last September.
 Financing does not go directly to political parties. The endowment channeled nearly $350,000 to the international wings of the Republican and Democratic parties, the International Republican Institute, the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, and the foreign policy arm of the AFL-CIO, the American Center for International Labor Solidarity. Those organizations ran workshops and training sessions and offered advice to three political parties -- Democratic Action, Copei and First Justice -- as well as the Venezuelan Workers Confederation. 
 The leaders of all these organizations have been at the forefront of the anti-Chavez movement.

HEADLINE: Ground Zero Must Wait to Grow Up

BYLINE: By David W. Dunlap

 BODY:
THE future may be smaller than you think.
 Forget, for a moment, the image of crystalline office buildings encircling the World Trade Center site. Until the end of this decade, there is likely to be only one skyscraper, the Freedom Tower, soaring over a low-rise retail archipelago.
 As plans for ground zero assume their final form, it is more apparent than ever that what New York will get -- at least in the near future -- is a far cry from the renderings by Studio Daniel Libeskind that captivated and puzzled the public a year ago. 
 Instead of three towers along Church Street, which are to materialize eventually under the Libeskind plan, officials foresee three small buildings being constructed by 2009, with 310,500 square feet of retail space among them (about 10 percent less than the retail space in the new Time Warner Center). 
 They would be kin to small commercial buildings, known as ''taxpayers,'' that generate enough income to pay the property tax bill until the market can support more ambitious development plans.
 These structures would either be temporary, like the Times Square Brewery that stood briefly at Broadway and 42nd Street, or they would be permanent, ultimately serving as structural podiums for high-rise towers above, like the Hearst Magazine Building and the Newsweek Building at Eighth Avenue and 57th Street.
 In any case, they would fill three large lots that might otherwise stay vacant until there is demand for 5.8 million square feet of additional office space downtown. And that could be a long time.
 ''We want to fill the voids,'' said Joseph J. Seymour, executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. ''We want to create street activity.''
 The authority owns the trade center site and controls the retail leasehold. It is working on the outlines of the retail program with the Jones Lang LaSalle real estate concern and Callison Architecture, after which it expects to designate an operator. ''Lower Manhattan is begging for more retailing,'' Mr. Seymour said.
 The City Planning Commission endorsed the place-holding structures on Monday, saying that the plan ''under which the retail bases of all commercial buildings would be constructed prior to the tower structures themselves is a logical and feasible approach to creating a successful pedestrian environment early in the process.''
 Podium structures could have another benefit, in the eyes of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, by providing room -- in double-height chambers above the three stories of retail space -- for the mechanical equipment needed to serve the vast underground areas, including the PATH station and pedestrian concourses.
 ''This is a way of avoiding having to have 40-foot-high cooling and ventilating towers at intervals throughout the site,'' said Andrew Winters, a vice president of the corporation who directs planning, design and development. The roofs of the mechanical penthouses could one day serve as staging areas for the construction of the towers above, which would permit the stores below to stay open.
 THOUGH two-stage, podium and-tower developments are not exactly commonplace, they have been tried before.
 The monumental colonnade around the base of the Newsweek Building is the visible remnant of the three-story Colonnade Building, begun in 1922. The 21-story addition, originally occupied by General Motors, was completed five years later.
 William Randolph Hearst's six-story structure of 1928, originally the International Magazine Building, had to wait far longer for its intended tower. In fact, the 36-story high-rise portion is just being constructed now, to designs by Norman Foster.
 As it happens, Lord Foster is also one of three architects chosen by Larry A. Silverstein, the commercial office leaseholder at the trade center site, to design the skyscrapers that will follow Freedom Tower. So it may be that while Lord Foster is finishing one podium uptown, he will be creating a podium of his own downtown.
 In broad concept, it sounds as if Mr. Silverstein endorses the idea.
 ''Development of first-class retail is an absolutely critical component of the World Trade Center rebuilding plan,'' said Janno Lieber, Mr. Silverstein's World Trade Center project director. ''We would like to see it brought on line as quickly as feasible.''
 There are still important unanswered questions. What high-end retailer wants to lease space in a building that may well wind up as the base of a construction project, if it is not torn down altogether? Will there be enough customers before the other towers are built? Would the layout of the podium restrict the design of the office floors above?
 The Civic Alliance to Rebuild Downtown New York, an umbrella organization of 27 planning, environmental, civic and other groups, criticized the development corporation on Tuesday for not providing a detailed evaluation of the low-rise interim buildings in the draft environmental impact statement, which is now out for comment.
 ''While reduced office density on-site may in fact be a desirable outcome,'' the alliance said in a 10-page report, ''this scenario should be planned for and occur by design rather than by default.''
 Perhaps the biggest unanswered question is whether a constituency will develop over time for low-rise buildings immediately to the east of the memorial, making it that much harder politically to start building towers on those sites in the future.
 But Mr. Winters does not think that will happen. ''People still have an understanding in their minds of the World Trade Center site as a place of tall buildings.''

HEADLINE: Let the Design Sprint Begin

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP

 BODY:
HERE are five scenes from the buffed-up city yet to come. Perhaps never to come, alas. Five architecture teams have prepared designs for an Olympic Village, to be in Long Island City, Queens, to help New York win its bid to be host to the summer games in 2012. The designs were unveiled yesterday and will be on view for the next two weeks at Vanderbilt Hall in Grand Central Terminal. A winning design will be chosen in May. After that, who knows? 
 Built by private developers, the Olympic Village would house 1,600 athletes during the games. Afterward, the complex would become middle-income housing. The site would occupy the southern portion of Queens West, the state-sponsored residential development across the East River from the United Nations headquarters.
 The creative ambition of the teams is pitched at a high level, overall, and it must be said at the outset that this is an impressive achievement in itself. Whether New York is chosen over London, Paris and the six other contending cities, it says a good deal that a city agency has embraced architects of the caliber of Zaha Hadid, Thom Mayne, and the Dutch firm MVRDV. In this case, the agency is NYC2012, the outfit established for planning the Olympics bid. 
 Selected from 130 entries from 20 countries, the finalists also include Henning Larsens Tegnestue of Copenhagen and Smith-Miller & Hawkinson Architects of New York. 
 The public deserves much of the credit for the quality of the Olympics proposals. In July 2002, New Yorkers rejected the initial round of plans for the World Trade Center site. Alexander Garvin, a city planning commissioner who presided over the design of ground zero, is performing the same function for the Olympics bid. Aesthetically, at least, the design process is starting off on a sounder footing this time around.
 The audience for civic works, we are again reminded, does not consist exclusively of neighborhood groups. It also includes an audience as broad and international as that for Olympic sports. At the Grand Central show, there are ideas of which any city can be proud. 
 The Olympic Village is part of a brilliant master plan for the games devised by Mr. Garvin in 2002. Entitled the Olympic X Plan, the scheme uses the city's transportation system to link new and existing sports venues arranged in giant intersecting axes draped across all five boroughs and the New Jersey Meadowlands. The Olympic Village sits at the center of the crossing, facing the Manhattan skyline. The view could make even the losers feel like champions.
 In another sign of changing times, the architects were instructed to disregard the development's original master plan, by the New York firm Beyer Blinder Belle, architects of ill-fated ground zero plans.
 Instead, following the example of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation's ''innovative design study,'' the teams have been asked to submit ideas for planning as well as architectural design. 
 This is not a design competition, although it has the general appearance of one. There is no formal jury (deliberations will be conducted by a loose group associated with NYC2012, including Mr. Garvin and Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development). There is also no fixed set of criteria by which the designs will be judged. We don't yet know whether the winner will be an architect or a design.
 The schemes presented are proposals, not fully developed master plans or designs for actual buildings. This is a study of ideas or, to use a term now largely discredited by its abuse by politicians, an array of ''visions'' to support the city's bid. We've had our Libeskind vision, and now we will have our Hadid, Smith-Miller & Hawkinson and MVRDV visions. Two projects, in particular, stand out: Mr. Mayne's and Ms. Hadid's. These designs are radically different in form, but they share a trait. Both attempt to revive urban concepts repudiated by city planners more than a generation ago.
 For Mr. Mayne, the concept is the megastructure, a sweeping, usually horizontal building much favored by progressive architects in the 1960's. A spinoff of the British Brutalist movement, the megastructure combined architecture and urbanism beneath a single roof. Typically, it housed a variety of functions, including schools, shops, offices and recreation as well as housing.
 An ambitious example for lower Manhattan was proposed by Paul Rudolph in 1970. But the most notorious, and possibly most outstanding, example of the genre is that symbol of Nixon's Washington, the Watergate complex.
 The highly articulated forms of Mr. Mayne's facades suggest that his design, too, contains a mixed program. It consists entirely of housing, however. This represents a partial reversion to the Unite d'Habitation in Marseille, the residential blocks designed by Le Corbusier in the late 1940's. The Unite, which included an interior arcade of shops and a rooftop park, was the original inspiration for the megastructure concept.
 Ms. Hadid has reached back even further in time but, again, to Le Corbusier. She proposes nothing less than our old friend and favorite postmodern enemy, the Towers in the Park. Entitled the Radiant City, the concept was presented by Le Corbusier in 1931. In the postwar years, it became the leading paradigm for urban renewal projects in the United States, where it became synonymous with the modern movement's ambition to engineer society.
 It does not require a long memory to recall why both Corbusian models eventually came under attack. With both, the architect asserted a uniform control that all but eliminated urban diversity. They eliminated conventional streets and with them continuity with the surrounding urban fabric. They also eliminated the ''eyes on the street,'' the neighborhood self-policing that results from active street life. These powerful objections, raised by Jane Jacobs in 1960, went far toward discrediting modern architecture in the United States.
 Times change. So do urban scale, the meaning of modernity and the relationship of cities to their past, including modernisms gone by. Not all towers-in-a-park designs were failures. A few, like Waterside on the East River and Silver Towers in Greenwich Village, contributed to the rich diversity of the cityscape.
 Mr. Mayne's and Ms. Hadid's projects do not stem solely from Le Corbusier. They also embody Oscar Niemeyer's concept of the poetic urban object and the sculptural tradition that has been carried forward in recent years by Frank Gehry. These designs are right-brain poetry, not the precisely calibrated gridscapes of modernism's cold, objective truth. The forms are sensuous, playful, sinewy, as if the buildings had incorporated nature into themselves instead of standing apart from it. 
 The other three projects are skimpy on the wow factor. This doesn't disqualify them, of course. All five designs deserve more than a once-over. MVRDV's proposal at least has the advantage of simplicity. The Rotterdam office wants to build a big beach with some housing behind it, a not unnatural shift in emphasis for a time of global warming. The Dutch will have much to teach us as water levels rise. In the 1970's, Rem Koolhaas gave us ''Delirious New York.'' Now, MVRDV gives us ''Drowned New Amsterdam,'' a reprise of colonial times as our great city subsides beneath the waves.
 To judge from the proposal by the firm Henning Larsens Tegnestue, New York still looks delirious to the Danes. It divides the site into four zoning quadrants: a pleasing reminder of its placement in the X Plan, but an idea with unfortunate theme park connotations. This is Manhattan replayed on the scale of ''It's a Small World,'' with miniature versions of Times Square, Central Park and Co-op City.
 And it could work. At least, for people who want to raise their children in a theme park. Yet it is hard to shake the feeling that the design is intended as a parody of post-Cold War fortress America, with its intoxicating, commercialized freedoms gaily paraded beneath the scrutiny of video surveillance cameras and Men in Black. As Vincent Scully might put it, the Danes have got our number, and it hurts.
 The Smith-Miller & Hawkinson submission is almost unaccountably dull. I say almost, because I suspect that the design's pedestrian quality may be calculated. This is one of those mysteries that can occur when you hold a competition while denying that it is a competition: nobody really knows the rules. You can tell architects to go all out for innovation and imagination, but when the time comes to pick a winner you throw all this rationale in the air about budget, feasibility, community preference and so on. 
 It shouldn't work that way. It's somehow less than obedient to the Olympic spirit. If you want architects to compete on the level of architecture, that is the sole basis on which a winner should be chosen. Then, should New York be fortunate enough to be host to the games in 2012, there will be more than enough time to deal with the pragmatics. This is all just fantasy, right?

BYLINE: By Winnie Hu (NYT); Compiled by Ian Urbina

 BODY:
The City Council yesterday adopted a $45.8 million operating budget for the next fiscal year, which begins July 1. 
The Council's budget, which includes salaries for council members and their staff, represented a change of only $7,165 from the year before. Councilman David I. Weprin, chairman of the Finance Committee, pointed out that council leaders had kept their overall spending level virtually unchanged in spite of inflation, rising rents and the addition of several legislative committees.

HEADLINE: Bush Plans Talk on Jobs At L.I. Plant

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
President George W. Bush plans to visit Long Island today, and his first stop -- a small but growing company called U.S.A. Industries in Bay Shore -- is aimed at underscoring administration efforts to revive the economy.
 The company, which started in 1985 with just three employees, now has a payroll of about 220. But most of its growth was in the 1980's and 1990's, before Mr. Bush took office. Still, the company added about 20 workers in the last three years. That was better than the national economy did, losing more than two million jobs since Mr. Bush became president, Democratic critics are quick to complain. 
 U.S.A. Industries' patriotic initials -- dressed up in red, white and blue stars and stripes on its Web site logo, www.usaind.com -- make the factory a natural for a presidential visit. But the full company name is more mundane. Also known as United Starters and Alternators, it rebuilds automobile parts for resale nationally.
 After touring the site, the president plans to have what the White House calls a ''conversation on the economy and job training,'' attended by the news media.
 State officials said they picked the company for the president to see because his staff wanted an example of prosperity and enterprise.
 ''It's a company that has proved that, yes, we can compete in manufacturing,'' despite worries about losing jobs to other states and even overseas, said Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the state's economic development agency, the Empire State Development Corporation.
 Founded and owned by Vincent Trapani, U.S.A Industries says it has become ''one of the nation's largest remanufacturers of automotive alternators, starters, axles and disc brake calipers'' by stressing quality, prompt delivery and competitive prices.
 The company's growth was also nurtured by Mr. Gargano's agency and Suffolk County through discounted loans, grants and tax breaks to finance expansion.
 ''It is a success story, and we've had others,'' said Pearl M. Kamer, chief economist for the Long Island Association, a regional business group.
 Over all, Nassau and Suffolk Counties fared better than the rest of the nation, gaining 4,600 jobs in the last three years, Dr. Kamer said. That was modest compared with the 117,000 jobs added in the previous four years under President Bill Clinton, but much better than the 88,000 jobs lost in the 1991-93 recession, she said. The local unemployment rate in January was 4.8 percent, compared with 6.3 nationally, not seasonally adjusted. 
 But the state has lost nearly 300,000 jobs under Mr. Bush, said United States Representative Nydia M. Velazquez, the ranking Democrat on the House Small Business Committee. ''It doesn't appear to me that his economic policies are doing anything to put New Yorkers back to work,'' she said.

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Amen I say in response to Thomas L. Friedman's March 7 column, ''The Secret of Our Sauce.'' Small businesses created 70 to 80 percent of the new jobs in the United States economy during the 1990's because the institutional makeup of the economy allowed entrepreneurship and innovation to thrive. 
 While innovation may spur small business, trade protectionism inhibits it. Free trade either in the form of imported products or offshore outsourcing lowers the cost of technology and services, making them affordable to small businesses. The wealth generated through free trade also increases financial market liquidity, thereby easing the ability of small businesses to acquire loans. 
 Indeed, it is ironic that the American gentleman whom Mr. Friedman describes as turning his free trade-induced job loss into a marketable opportunity creating and selling T-shirts could happen only because the shirts were produced abroad at low cost.

HEADLINE: Canada Says It May Emulate California on Auto Emissions

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM; Bernard Simon in Toronto contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
The environment minister of Canada said yesterday that his country would emulate California's new law aimed at curbing automotive global warming emissions if carmakers did not agree to make significant reductions.
 ''Unless we get a voluntary agreement, our intention is to make use of the California model,'' David Anderson, Canada's environmental minister, said in an interview shortly before a speech about global warming at the University of Toronto. 
 The notion of Canada following in California's footsteps will not appeal to automakers, who have said they will sue to keep the state's global warming law from taking effect. But Mr. Anderson said the Canadian government had not yet given up on reaching a voluntary agreement. 
 Canada has been negotiating with automakers and representatives of other industries since December 2002, when it signed on to the Kyoto Protocol, a global accord on limiting emissions of gases linked to climate change that has been rejected by the Bush administration and Russia. 
 As part of the Canadian government's effort to meet the Kyoto targets, it has asked automakers to improve the fuel efficiency of Canadian vehicles by 25 percent by 2010. Mr. Anderson said that so far, the industry had balked at such a notion. 
 ''They say it's impractical,'' he said. ''They say it's out of sync with the United States so it would affect the common market with the U.S. and Canada, so that's why it would be important for us to find state partners.''
 Mark Nantais of the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers Association, a lobbying group, said his group was talking with the government. ''We're basically discussing the progress we've made to date and the progress we will be making with the introduction of new technologies.''
 He said he had not seen Mr. Anderson's speech, which was made late yesterday afternoon. 
 The auto industry voluntarily follows United States fuel economy regulations in Canada as well. But Mr. Anderson, a member of the ruling Liberal Party, said in the interview that he had been frustrated that the growth of sport utility vehicles had stalled fuel efficiency gains in both countries. 
 ''Our difficulty now is that the U.S. federal government is not seeing eye to eye with us on the importance of reductions from the automobile sector,'' he said. He added that Canada's government could carry out a law passed by Parliament in 1982 that would give the country its own fuel economy standards. 
 Or Canada might look to pattern regulations after California, the one state allowed to write its own air quality standards because of its history of smog. Other states can choose California's rules instead of the federal government's, and many in the Northeast have done so. 
 ''We can together create a critical mass in the integrated North American market,'' Mr. Anderson said in his speech, according to a transcript. ''This is particularly crucial for climate-friendly vehicles.''

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Were Narrowly Higher Last Month

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 11 

 BODY:
Retail sales increased in February but the gains were mostly confined to autos and department stores, the Commerce Department said Thursday.
 In another report, initial claims for unemployment benefits decreased last week. 
 Retail sales rose 0.6 percent, to a seasonally adjusted $327.17 billion in February, in line with Wall Street economists' expectations. But sales other than vehicles were flat compared with January, defying economists' projections of a 0.5 percent gain.
 The Labor Department reported that first-time claims for jobless benefits dipped 6,000, to 341,000, last week. Analysts had expected a level around 345,000. 
 Economists were mildly encouraged by a drop in continued claims in the week ended Feb. 28, to the lowest level in two and a half years.
 ''That's not a lot of layoffs, but it doesn't tell us that there's a lot of hiring,'' said Robert Brusca, chief economist in New York with Native American Securities.
 Eric Green, senior economist with BNP Paribas in New York, called the retail sales data ''fairly anemic.'' 
 ''It was a little weaker than expected in February,'' he said, ''but it isn't anything to be concerned about.''
 Some of the sting was taken out of the February data by an upward revision of January sales figures, to a 0.2 percent increase, with sales excluding autos rising 1.2 percent. Previously, January sales were reported as being down 0.3 percent over all and aside from autos, up only 0.9 percent.
 Retail sales are watched as a major part of consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of total economic activity.

HEADLINE: An Epicure's 15-Course French Feast

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
IT was almost exactly a year ago that a stilted new term, ''freedom fries,'' abruptly entered American parlance by addressing an embarrassing political schism. As a result of France's refusal to support the American cause in Iraq, freedom fries, and their cousin, freedom toast, replaced French fries and French toast on the menus of some outraged restaurateurs. That name change, silly as it was, bared a long-simmering cultural antagonism between imperial (American) machismo and a more feminine (French) Epicureanism, and ratcheted it up a notch.
 To people like me, who harbor more than a grain of Francophilia, that antagonism predated the contretemps that gave us freedom fries. It has been evident for years in the series ''Rendez-Vous With French Cinema,'' which the Film Society of Lincoln Center presents with Unifrance and the French Film Office. In this year's series, which begins today and continues through March 21 at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center, 15 French films can be seen before their commercial release, although a number will probably never have an American distributor. 
 The imperial versus the Epicurean tones of national cinemas is worth contemplating because each philosophy has far-reaching implications about what the future should be like. The imperial view typified by a multinational epic like ''The Lord of the Rings'' trilogy exalts heroic warfare as an expression of moral certainty in the continuing war between good and evil. The Epicurean, while acknowledging good and evil, celebrates a much smaller, warmer and more relativist vision of life.
 True to the Gallic film tradition, a handful of this year's movies portray French middle-class life (especially in Paris) as a movable feast in which good food, fine wine, elegant fashions, sexual sophistication and literary erudition together equal civility. Yes, American movies also celebrate living well, but they have a very different attitude toward the good life. Consumption, rather than being cozy and personal as it is in French movies, is usually conspicuous, often cold, and connected to status. In the imperial tradition it is more important to win the game of life than to enjoy it.
 After watching 14 of the 15 movies (one entry, ''Feelings,'' was not screened for the press), I came away with mixed feelings about freedom fries versus French fries (let's just call them pommes frites), cinematically speaking. To be fair, the Gallic tradition is sweeter and more realistic. But there is something to be said for epic, heroic visions, even wrongheaded, belligerent ones. They think and at least try to feel big. You can't change the world, for better or worse, without that enormity of purpose.

Breaking the Mold, Violently
 That's one reason the most compelling films in this year's series, Bruno Dumont's ''Twentynine Palms'' and the German-born filmmaker Michael Haneke's ''Time of the Wolf,'' don't seem as classically French as many of the others.
 ''Twentynine Palms'' is the third film by Mr. Dumont, whose first two, ''La Vie de Jesus'' and ''L'Humanite'' (released here as ''Humanite''), portray life in a sleepy provincial town in northern France as a hotbed of barely suppressed brutality and rampant animal instinct. Mr. Dumont has called his new film, set in and around Joshua Tree National Park in the California desert, a horror movie because it beefs up the same sense of animalism to supersize proportions.
 The story follows the circuitous, largely wordless journey via red Hummer of David, a young American, and his volatile Eastern European sweetheart, Katia, into the desert to take pictures. The lovers communicate largely through intense, grappling sexual encounters, which in Mr. Dumont's radically unglamorous view of screen sex are portrayed as the volcanic matings of two beasts, accompanied by contorted grimaces, and wild grunts and screams.
 But in its focus on aridity and its level of violence, ''Twentynine Palms'' is bleaker and more extreme than its forerunners. Much like Gaspar Noe's film ''Irreversible,'' which unblinkingly observed a protracted rape, ''Twentynine Palms'' is likely to divide people into two strongly opinionated camps. You can accept the film as a nasty rub-your-nose-in-it vision of reality with the insulation torn away or reject it as a sensationalistic, exploitative piece of pretentious misanthropy.

Apocalypse. Then?
 Because the ferocity and unexpectedness of the shocks at the end of ''Twentynine Palms'' evoke the terrorist attacks on the United States, that film is thematically the most American of the movies here this year. It is matched in bleakness by Mr. Haneke's ''Time of the Wolf,'' which imagines what would be left of civilization after an unnamed apocalyptic disaster in an unidentified country. Is this place, which is without electricity (except for batteries) and has scant food or water, worth living in or not, the film wonders. And it forces the viewer to wonder, too.
 In a landscape littered with dying farm animals, the survivors huddle together in an unheated railroad station, desperately hoping that a train will arrive with supplies and good news. The story focuses on a mother (Isabelle Huppert) and her young son and daughter entering this improvised community, which lives by the barter system and where superstitions and xenophobia surface.
 Mr. Haneke has always delighted in keeping audiences scared and off-balance. In ''The Piano Teacher'' Ms. Huppert played a repressed, sadomasochistic concert pianist who acts out her fantasies with a vengeance.
 In his almost unwatchable ''Funny Games,'' two thrill-killers go from house to house at a luxurious summer retreat, torturing and killing the residents. Since the actual violence is left to the imagination, Mr. Haneke makes his fiendish point that in the movies the imminent threat of sadistic violence is as unbearable (or perhaps more so) than the actual sight of it.
 ''Time of the Wolf'' does more than ask ''What if?'' It has no outside perspective. Plunked down in the midst of chaos, the viewer is forced to experience vicariously what the characters are going through. Many scenes are filmed in darkness or semidarkness in which it is impossible for the viewer -- or the characters -- to discern what exactly is happening. The absence of light is scary. But when there is light, it is often too much. At any moment the bonfires that provide some warmth can spread out of control. Or a character can simply give up and jump into one of them.
 ''Twentynine Palms'' and ''Time of the Wolf'' pay a dramatic price for their grand notions. Their characters, pitiable as they may be, remain at a distance. And even Ms. Huppert, who can be as severe as a thunderclap, doesn't emerge as a full character.

Another Year of the Woman
 The third film to evoke a perilous post-9/11 world, Guillaume Nicloux's ''Hanging Offense,'' imagines the worsening psychological nightmare of a police captain (Josiane Balasko), who confuses an unsolved murder that obsesses her with the looming anniversary of her young son's death, for which she feels responsible. Grimly purposeful on the job, she finds herself increasingly unable to distinguish the real from the unreal, and as the anniversary approaches her torments seem increasingly like cruel, humiliating rehearsals for an execution.
 One of the glories of the Gallic movie tradition is its lack of ageism and sexism. In film after film, year after year, women of a certain age play roles whose heroic or symbolic status is equal to the importance that Hollywood films give to the likes of Harrison Ford. You could say that Jeanne Moreau, still sexy in her 70's, is the French answer to Clint Eastwood. 
 Ms. Huppert and Ms. Balasko are only two of the many women who lend this year's ''Rendez-Vous'' an especially strong female profile. In Anne Fontaine's ''Nathalie,'' an elongated psychological tease with an ending worthy of Maupassant, Fanny Ardant plays a woman who suspects her husband (Gerard Depardieu) of infidelities. She hires a prostitute (Emmanuelle Beart) to seduce him and then tell her every detail.
 The main character of Siegrid Alnoy's film ''She's One of Us'' is an efficient but alienated office worker who is not the angel she appears to be to her admiring bosses. On one level this movie seems to be a critique of a sterile modern office environment, where efficiency, obedience and blandness are valued above all else.

Moody and Metaphoric
 In Gilles Marchand's sleek medical thriller ''Who Killed Bambi?'' Sophie Quinton, a fresh young actress with a Renee Zellweger-like appeal, plays a nurse who suspects a poker-faced young surgeon (Laurent Lucas) of stealing anesthetics to molest, then murder female patients. For all the ominous beauty of its empty hospital corridors, the movie is so infatuated with its own atmosphere that it lacks the tautness of superior Hollywood forerunners like ''Coma.''
 A similar combination of high gloss and narrative confusion flaws Gilles Bourdos's beautifully filmed but grim reflection on the budding relationship of two young lovers who have survived childhood traumas. The movie, ''A Sight for Sore Eyes,'' adapted from a Ruth Rendell novel, plays pretentiously arty games of narrative hide-and-seek and dotes with such fetishistic insistence on visual metaphors (like empty white houses) that it squanders much of its suspense on chic frills.
 And where is that quintessentially Gallic movable feast? This year there are several variations. ''The Cost of Living,'' Philippe Le Guay's smart comic mosaic of lives that eventually collide in a maternity ward, examines people's attitudes toward money, from the reckless gambling and extravagance of a charming restaurant owner to the spending education of a quivering, constipated skinflint, overseen by the expensive prostitute he hires to train him in extravagance. Simply by dwelling on the characters' intimate relationships with money -- a subject that seems as taboo in France as in the United States -- the movie strikes a blow for more disclosure.

Big in France
 Most of the charm of Merzak Allouache's ''Chouchou,'' a sentimental drag comedy adapted from a performance piece, derives from the zany wide-eyed charm of its star, Gad Elmaleh, whose character juggles two jobs, one as a psychiatrist's assistant and the other as a nightclub performer. That charm helped the warmhearted movie, which is far less cohesive or funny than ''La Cage aux Folles,'' become a hit in France. The same spirit of daffy merriment infuses Pierre Salvadori's ''After You,'' an absurdist farce in which Daniel Auteuil plays a headwaiter who saves a self-loathing stranger (Jose Garcia) from hanging himself. The good Samaritan overdoes it when he tries to be the man's full-time social, economic and romantic rescuer.
 This year the most erotic film of the series -- and one of its most French -- is Robert Salis's ''Grande Ecole,'' which follows the romantic and sexual peccadilloes of three male roommates at an elite French business school. It's not hard to prefer this group portrait of sexually active students and their lovers to most American counterparts simply because ''Grande Ecole'' doesn't go in for smirking innuendo; the typical American screen conflict between puritanism and prurience is absent. And to top it all off, the characters are uniformly smart and well-enough read to drop names like Chateaubriand and Foucault.
 But ''Grande Ecole,'' which wants to make stinging observations about smugness, class differences and snobbery, is so distracted by its own warmblooded sensuality (it has male and female nudity and abundant sex), that its political agenda is seriously muted by the afterglow.
 Francophiles may be charmed by ''Not on the Lips,'' Alain Resnais's screen adaptation of a 1925 French operetta by Andre Barde and Maurice Yvain. A period drawing-room comedy with perky songs and jokes, this movie is as opulent as it is stylized, and it is not for me.

Napoleon's Island
 The closest the series comes to the kind of heroic myth making found in American movies is in Antoine de Caunes's fascinating and likable ''Monsieur N.,'' a historical drama that pays detailed attention to the swirl of politics and intrigue surrounding Napoleon Bonaparte (Philippe Torreton) during his exile in St. Helena. I liked it better than the more blustery ''Master and Commander,'' which it distantly resembles.
 This year's most free-spirited film is Siegfried's black-and-white cinematic whirlwind ''Sansa,'' which follows a peripatetic street artist (Roschdy Zem) on his vagabond travels from Paris to St. Petersburg to Tokyo and beyond. The movie, which has no plot to speak of except for the reappearance of an older conductor who appreciates the traveler's vitality, is best viewed as a portrait gallery of faces from around the world, a kind of ''Family of Man'' a go-go, if you will.
 The director finally banks everything on the screen presence of Mr. Zem, whom he films like a latter-day Jean-Paul Belmondo, complete with cigarette butts and an insouciant sexiness. My response to Mr. Zem isn't so enthusiastic; as charming as he is, he is not quite a star to the depth of his bones.

HEADLINE: Immigrants' Businesses Are Seen As Crucial to City's Economy

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
An Asian-American businessman wanted to borrow money to import bear gallbladders, but all the banks he approached turned him down. ''They said, 'What, are you crazy?''' recalled Joyce O. Moy, director of the Small Business Development Center of LaGuardia Community College, who was on a lively panel yesterday on how the city can better tap the economic potential of immigrant entrepreneurs.
 Ms. Moy said she took the would-be importer to an Asian bank that understood the money-making potential in the man's proposal. There is a market for bear gallbladders, she explained, ''in the medicinal-herbal area, and it's legal.'' 
 ''They lent him the money,'' she said.
 The moral of Ms. Moy's tale, like many shared at the forum, which was organized by the Center for an Urban Future at the New School University, is that without better ties to immigrant communities and more creative risks, the city's economic establishment would lose a golden opportunity to make the city's immigrant entrepreneurs more of an economic engine. ''The banks are really missing in action in a lot of this,'' said Jonathan Bowles, the center's research director.
 Unlike large manufacturers, immigrant businesses often need to remain within the city or close by, he noted, to stay near customers and workers. But besides the problems that frustrate other city business owners, like the high cost of real estate as well as bureaucratic red tape, even successful immigrant businesses often face other obstacles, including the lack of three years of standard financial statements that banks typically want before making a loan. 
 As an alternative, some immigrants turn to Accion New York, an organization that provides loans and other support services to microentrepreneurs. Nathalie Bernal, Accion's vice president for lending, who was another panelist, cited as examples a Latin restaurant in Queens that needed $1,500 to replace spoiled food after last year's blackout, a Harlem T-shirt vendor from Senegal who had lost $3,000 worth of merchandise in a robbery, and a bakery that needed cash to repair a broken oven.
 Many immigrant entrepreneurs who come to Accion operate only in cash, she said, and have not filed complete tax statements. Though they may have paid rent, utilities and cellphone bills on time for years, their track records do not count toward establishing their creditworthiness, Ms. Bernal said.

HEADLINE: No More Excuses on Jobs

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN. 
E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
As job growth continues to elude the U.S. economy, we're hearing two main excuses from the Bush administration and its supporters: that the real situation is much better than you're hearing, and that to the extent employment is lagging, it's the result of factors outside the administration's control. But after three years of extravagant promises and dismal results, the time for excuses has passed.
 Let's start with the real job situation. A number of readers have asked me about what Marc Racicot, who heads the Bush re-election effort, told Don Imus the other day. He claimed that those miserable job numbers are misleading, and that another survey presents both a more accurate and a much happier story. You can find the same claim all over the right-wing media. But it just isn't so. 
 It's true that there are two employment surveys, which have been diverging lately. The establishment survey, which asks businesses how many workers they employ, says that 2.4 million jobs have vanished in the last three years. The household survey, which asks individuals whether they have jobs, says that employment has actually risen by 450,000. The administration's supporters, understandably, prefer the second number.
 But the experts disagree. According to Alan Greenspan: ''I wish I could say the household survey were the more accurate. Everything we've looked at suggests that it's the payroll data which are the series which you have to follow.'' You may have heard that the establishment survey doesn't count jobs created by new businesses; not so. The bureau knows what it's doing -- conservative commentators are raising objections only because they don't like the facts.
 And even the less reliable household survey paints a bleak picture of an economy in which jobs have lagged far behind population growth. The fraction of adults who say they are employed fell steeply between early 2001 and the summer of 2003, and has stagnated since then.
 But wait -- hasn't the unemployment rate fallen since last summer? Yes, but that's entirely the result of people dropping out of the labor force. Even if you're out of work, you're not counted as unemployed unless you're actively looking for a job.
 We don't know why so many people have stopped looking for jobs, but it probably has something to do with the fact that jobs are so hard to find: 40 percent of the unemployed have been out of work more than 15 weeks, a 20-year record. In any case, the administration should feel grateful that so many people have dropped out. As the Economic Policy Institute points out, if they hadn't dropped out, the official unemployment rate would be an eye-popping 7.4 percent, not a politically spinnable 5.6 percent.
 In short, things aren't as bad as they seem; they're worse. But should we blame the Bush administration? Yes -- because it refuses to learn from experience.
 Franklin Roosevelt, in his efforts to combat economic woes, was famously willing to try anything until he found something that worked. George Bush, by contrast, seems determined to try the same thing, over and over again.
 In 2001 the administration rammed through long-term tax cuts, heavily tilted toward the affluent. But employment didn't turn around, and by late 2002 many economists -- including supporters of the original tax cut -- were urging it to try something different. My own piece, ''My Economic Plan,'' was fairly typical: I called for extended unemployment benefits, temporary aid to state and local governments, and rebates for low- and middle-income workers. 
 Maybe this more or less textbook response to a depressed economy wouldn't have worked. But we'll never know, because the administration rejected all such proposals. Instead, it went for a clone of the 2001 tax cut -- another big break mainly for those at the top. And once again this failed to deliver the promised jobs.
 Meanwhile, Mr. Bush has mortgaged the nation's future. If all of his tax cuts are made permanent, they'll reduce revenue by at least three times the amount that would be needed to secure Social Security benefits at current levels for the next 75 years. 
 No sensible person blames Mr. Bush for the onset of the recession in 2001. But he does deserve blame for the fact that all he has to show for three years of supposed job-creation policies is a mountain of debt.

HEADLINE: Houses With Maple Trees: Beauty, Shade and, Sometimes, Syrup

BYLINE: As told to Seth Kugel

 BODY:

WHO -- Joseph S. Nye, 67, dean of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University; shown with Molly Nye, 64, art consultant
WHAT -- Moose Meadow Farm, a 4-bedroom house on a 770-acre tree farm
WHERE -- North Sandwich, N.H.
 We bought this house in 1991, It's an old center-chimney colonial that was built in 1822. We were looking for a place where we could enjoy our children and grandchildren, of which we now have eight.
 About eight years ago we got into backyard maple sugaring, as they call it here. We're tapping two maples right behind the house along with about a dozen other trees.
 We are producing two and a half to three gallons of syrup, which sounds like a little, but that's 100 to 120 gallons of sap. The ratio is 40 to 1.
 The sap starts flowing around the end of February, beginning of March. You drill about a one-inch hole into the tree and you hammer in a little spout and hang buckets under those spouts. You collect the sap and boil it down. Then you filter it, put it in a jar, seal it and it's good for delicious waffles and pancakes for the rest of the year.
 You don't do it for the economics. It's therapy. Right now the snow is beginning to melt, but we won't see daffodils and forsythia for another six weeks. It gives you a feeling of new life and resurgence and spring well before you'll ever see spring.
 We have a friend, the president of a major university, who comes up to ski with us, and because she grew up in the South she thinks that real maple syrup doesn't taste quite right. So we do keep a little bit of the commercial stuff in the house. Real maple syrup is a lot better. And, you have the illusion that because you've made it yourself, it tastes particularly good.

HEADLINE: On Florida's West Coast, A Would-Be Palm Beach

BYLINE: By ROBERT ANDREW POWELL

 BODY:
AS you drive in from the Everglades on the Tamiami Trail, Naples announces itself on billboards. ''Premier master-planned gated'' communities with names like Veronawalk and Grandezza offer ''patio homes, single-family homes, and townhomes'' from the $200,000's in some developments to more than $4 million in others.
 At the city's edge, six-lane roads anticipate future construction. Ornate guardhouses protect undeveloped lots of brown dirt that once produced tomatoes and cucumbers. Now, there are paved roads and rows of flags fluttering on plots where houses will soon stand. ''January, February, March and April are our season,'' said Larry White, a real estate agent who works primarily with second-home buyers. ''When the snowbirds come, we work. Before they leave, they'll buy.''
 Naples, once isolated on the southwest coast of Florida, is booming. Two Ritz-Carlton resorts are along the same street. Property values in some developments have grown by a third in the last year alone. Residents enjoy more golf courses per person than anywhere else in America but Myrtle Beach, S.C. More than 100 art galleries fan out from the once sleepy downtown. A population that swells by a third in season, to approximately 280,000, provides enough economic bedrock to support a philharmonic orchestra. 
 When the population spikes in winter, real estate agents step into high gear. A woman who recently sold her horse farm in Kentucky impulsively bought a condo near the shops and restaurants of Old Naples. After visiting Naples for just three days, Chuck Meyer, a retiree from Little Rock, Ark., bought a $4 million house on an estuary just south of the original Ritz-Carlton Naples. 
 ''Naples is just a little more relaxed than anywhere else in Florida,'' said Mr. Meyer, who, along with his wife, owns a third home in Aspen. ''I bought for tax reasons'' -- Florida residents don't pay state income tax -- ''for the weather, and also because it was a gated community, which meant we don't have to worry about our property when we aren't in town.''
 However robust Naples's growth, the city is not for everybody. Unlike Miami or even Tampa, Naples is sound asleep by 10:30. The population is older, socially conservative and startlingly homogenous. Although the number of single, educated young professionals is rising in Naples, the city remains a place where an attractive woman in her 20's, sunning by the pool at La Playa Beach & Golf Resort, is asked by an attendant, in all seriousness, ''What are you even doing here?''
 For those comfortable with the demographics, the appeal of Naples is straightforward: winter temperatures into the 80's. Palm fronds rattled by gulf winds. The energy and enervation of Miami choked off by 110 miles of swaying saw grass. On the car radio, Frank Sinatra sings about having the world on a string. Closer to the Gulf of Mexico, established subdivisions belie Naples's laid-back ethos with high concrete walls, in some cases ringed with barbed wire. 
 ''I don't think that has much to do with security,'' said Joe Ballarino, president of the Naples Board of Realtors, referring to the prevalence of gated communities in the greater Naples area. ''I think it's just a perception that makes the buyer feel like their property is special.''
 THE southwestern tip of Florida was largely free of human life until the 1880's. That's when a Kentucky newspaper baron named Walter Haldeman discovered Naples, and helped plan it, build the town's pier and erect the settlement's only hotel. At one point, after his friends deserted him, he owned the entire town, which he ran largely as a hobby.
 A visiting advertising executive from Chicago jump-started Naples's evolution in 1938. John Glen Sample, bored with Palm Beach, decided to spend a few days in Naples. In what would become a common pattern among tourists, he fell in love with the place and promptly bought waterfront property.
 Sample also purchased land that he developed into Naples's priciest subdivision, Port Royal. He oversaw the installation of sewer lines and the laying of roads. He commissioned a variety of architects to diversify the look of his houses. 
 That was about all he diversified. Sample's vision of a city of wealthy, sophisticated homeowners didn't leave room for the fishing villages that were starting to spring up around town. In advertisements in Vogue, Town and Country, and other upscale publications, he warned that ''Money Alone Won't Buy a Lot in Port Royal.'' ''If he saw a guy wearing brown shoes with black socks or something like that, he wouldn't sell him the house,'' said Doris Reynolds, his former publicist. 
 Sample set the tone for Naples's future development. Ramshackle waterfront shacks blown down in 1960 by Hurricane Donna were replaced with more luxurious housing. (The insurance money that followed the storm also helped things along.) 
 Only a recession in the 70's democratized development. Builders started selling to anybody.
 While that killed Naples's chances of ever rivaling Palm Beach in luxury or prestige, people not named Pulitzer began to feel comfortable investing there. These days, tourists stroll downtown Naples in packs of four -- two men and two women. The dress code is all polo shirts, khaki shorts and white tennis shoes. Along the main drag, Fifth Avenue South, restaurants alternate with real estate agencies and shops that sell a botanical garden of brightly dyed linen dresses. The strip teems with a remarkably similar-looking crowd. In its own way, Fifth Avenue South is as much a convention of like-minded people as Daytona Beach's Main Street during Bike Week.
 Without the guiding hand of early developers like Sample, Naples might have evolved into a much different place. Eastern Collier County -- of which Naples is the seat -- is country music, barbecues and a red Ford F350 with the license plate CWGIRL. That alternate reality is on display at the Swamp Buggy Races on a track called the Mile o' Mud, eight miles east of Old Naples on Rattlesnake-Hammock Road.
 The track is oval with a diagonal lane slashed through, as if it were a no-smoking sign. Brackish brown water covers every inch of it. The water appears to be a foot deep, though it drops to five to six feet deep in three places. The extremely tall buggies driving through these holes disappear up to their steering wheels and exhaust pipes. Buford Reece Gardner, a buggy racer, lives not far from the track and he keeps his swamp buggy, NutRageous, in his backyard. 
 The housing boom in Naples has been good to Mr. Gardner. For 10 years he installed air-conditioners in the big houses rising in Port Royal and elsewhere. The influx of snowbirds kept him busy through the winter, and helped him prosper. On one job alone, he said, the unit he installed cost $300,000. As grateful as he was for the work, he is bittersweet about the town's evolution.
 ''You get some place and pull off the side of the road and see a stand of cypress trees, the sun shining, the birds flying above, and it's just beautiful,'' he said. ''Then, a few months later, you pull into the same spot and it's being bulldozed for some new development.''
 Growth has put buggy racers like Mr. Gardner on notice. Recently he abandoned the air-conditioning business to pursue what seems, in Naples at least, to be a more sensible and potentially lucrative career. He has just completed classes and is awaiting his license. He's going to be a real estate agent.
 ISOLATED several miles north of Old Naples on a strip of beach that has since been colonized by other resort hotels, the Ritz-Carlton was the catalyst for the Naples renaissance when it opened in 1985. Its 51,000-square-foot spa still attracts tourists seeking European facials and relaxation massages. On sunny days, an outdoor mineral pool is ringed by guests roasting in white terry-cloth robes.
 In the Dining Room, the hotel's high-end restaurant, the menu runs to things like venison broth, foie gras with peanut brittle and tiramisu complicated by a dab of green apple sorbet. Denim is forbidden and jackets are required. But on a recent Friday night most of the men had simply slipped blue blazers over their golf shirts.
 Tales of missed putts and long drives mingled with notes from a jazz combo. One man from Minnesota told a joke about ice fishing. It was an appropriate scene for Naples: expensive, sophisticated and preening at times, but still democratic at heart. If you have money, and if you feel the city's attraction, Naples welcomes you.
 Golf is a dominant part of Naples's appeal. The city's first course was carved out in 1919 at a time when only about 100 people lived in Naples. Now around 100 courses snake through the city. At good public courses like the Naples Beach Club, golfers line up in their carts at 7:30 each morning, as if waiting for the start of the Indy 500. 
 To answer the demand, the newer Ritz, the Ritz-Carlton Golf Resort, Naples, features two 18-hole courses designed by Greg Norman. Golf teachers working the courses, together called Tiburon -- Spanish for shark, Mr. Norman's nickname -- break down their guests' swings using a computer. A round of golf can cost as much as $250, a price that hardly dents the savings of most snowbirds who are purchasing homes in the development. While a condo can sell for as little as $200,000, some single-family homes are more than $8 million.
 And business is good, said Mr. White, the real estate agent. ''Sales are strong in areas that are on the water or on the golf course,'' he said. ''Nine/eleven put a little dent in it, but it's since continued to rise and go. When President Bush landed on that air carrier, the phones started ringing and people started spending. It's really taken off.''

HEADLINE: Database Business Helps Oracle to a Solid Third Quarter

BYLINE: By LAURIE J. FLYNN

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, March 11 

 BODY:
The Oracle Corporation, which is pressing its hostile bid to acquire rival PeopleSoft, reported solid gains in third-quarter profit and revenue on Thursday, driven by strong sales of the company's database products. Oracle executives predicted technology spending would continue to improve throughout the year.
 ''This was a very strong quarter for our database business,'' said Jeffrey O. Henley, who was promoted to chairman last year and is the acting chief financial officer.
 While Oracle's database business grew 16 percent, revenue was flat in the closely watched applications business, where it competes with PeopleSoft and the German software maker SAP. In the database business, which accounts for most of Oracle's sales, price competition remains fierce, particularly with Microsoft, company executives said. 
 Wall Street takes a hard look at Oracle's earnings as an indication of the shape of software industry because it announces its earnings a full month before its competitors.
 For the quarter ended Feb. 29, the company, based in Redwood Shores, Calif., said net income rose 11 percent, to $635 million, or 12 cents a share, compared with $571 million, or 11 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue increased 9 percent, to $2.5 billion, from $2.3 billion. The results were in line with analysts' forecasts.
 Before the announcement of the results, shares of Oracle fell 16 cents, to $12.25. After hours, they rose as high as $12.40, before dipping to $12.18.
 During the quarter, Oracle's new software license sales were up 12 percent, to $847 million, and revenue for software license updates and product support was up 17 percent, to $1.2 billion. The company's operating margin was 37 percent, compared with 35 percent in the period a year earlier. 
 ''They were within a few degrees of everything we were looking for,'' said David M. Hilal, analyst at the Friedman Billings Ramsey Group. ''That's positive for them and positive for the group, given that it's normally a tough quarter.'' 
 Oracle's chief executive, Lawrence J. Ellison, said the company was experiencing a ''fundamental reshaping'' of its business, as its service and consulting business shrinks while its higher-margin software subscription business grows. 
 ''The most profitable portion of Oracle is also the largest portion of our business,'' Mr. Ellison said. 
 Mr. Henley said the company continued to see an overall improvement in technology spending, albeit a gradual one. ''We're optimistic business will modestly improve over the next year,'' he said. ''Business sentiment seems to be getting more confident.'' 
 He said he expected earnings in the fourth quarter, typically the company's strongest, to be 17 cents to 18 cents a share, on a 6 percent to 10 percent increase in revenue.
 The earnings report was Oracle's first since the Justice Department and seven states filed a lawsuit on Feb. 26 to block the company's $9.4 billion unsolicited takeover of PeopleSoft, based in Pleasanton, Calif.
 In a pretrial hearing in San Francisco on Wednesday, Judge Vaughn Walker of Federal District Court set a trial date of June 7. Mr. Ellison said that Judge Walker told the parties that he expected the trial to last four weeks. 
 Meanwhile, the European Union Commission, which is continuing its review of the deal for its impact on the European software market, may submit to Oracle a statement of objections within the next few days or weeks. 
 The statement, a fairly routine filing in deals of this size, will provide Oracle with a description of any problems the commission sees in the proposed merger.
 Oracle representatives declined to comment on whether the company had received one. The commission has set May 11 as the deadline for issuing a decision.
 In its earnings release, Oracle said it spent $15 million during the third quarter on its proposed acquisition of PeopleSoft, and a total of $43 million since making its initial offer nine months ago.

HEADLINE: Staking Out New Condos in a Giant's Turf

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE

 BODY:
In the shadow of the gargantuan AOL Time Warner Center on Columbus Circle, a century-old onetime telephone exchange is being renovated and expanded into a boutique condominium with 16 residences.
 In the $27 million transformation, 11 apartments, each with two or three bedrooms and 1,800 to 2,700 square feet, will be carved from the existing five-story structure at 426 West 58th Street, near Ninth Avenue. Rising atop that neo-Renaissance style building, built between 1900 and 1906 for the New York Telephone Company, will be a six-story addition comprising five apartments of 2,600 to 3,700 square feet each.
 Motivating the conversion of the building, to be known as West 58, is its location in a neighborhood whose changes are most dramatically signaled by the Time Warner Center, said Miki Naftali, president of Elad Properties, the developer. Elad has converted or built 11 other condominium projects in Manhattan totaling about 500 apartments. 
 Elad's intent, Mr. Naftali said, is to offer buyers a lower-priced alternative to the 201-apartment condominium at the Time Warner Center a block and a half away, where prices start at $2.6 million. Prices at West 58 are $1.4 million to $5 million, he said, adding that the project is to be completed by early next year.
 Mr. Naftali said that since the sales office opened at West 58 on Feb. 29, 10 apartments have been placed under contract, and prices had been raised three times. ''Our buyers are buying from floor plans because they realize their apartments will appreciate in value if they get in at the beginning of the project and the neighborhood,'' said Iva Spitzer, an executive vice president at the residential brokerage firm Douglas Elliman, the sales agent for West 58.
 Monica Blum, president of the 13-block Lincoln Square Business Improvement District, said West 58, just outside her district, would probably be the first of many new residential projects in the neighborhood.
 But Anthony Borelli, district manager at Community Board 4, said that while the Time Warner Center was impressive ''it is too early to tell what impact it will have on the area.''
 Mr. Naftali of Elad said that since his company had focused in recent years on converting commercial structures to housing, it sought out buildings ''that we see potential in and are not necessarily on the market.'' That was the case for the West 58th Street building.
 Adding to the attractions of the building's location and architecture, Mr. Naftali said, was the fact that the building, which he bought for $7.5 million, had only one occupant, the nonprofit Bureau of Jewish Education, making it easier to convert. He said he negotiated for six months with the educational group, which owned and occupied the building for the last 40 years, and closed the sale last September when the group relocated to new quarters in Midtown.
 Also attractive, Mr. Naftali said, was the ability to convert and expand the building without any special zoning approvals. The structure is built around a central courtyard, providing more windows to let light into the apartments. The structure itself could support the six new floors without extensive structural reinforcement, he said, noting that the extra floors were necessary to make the project ''economically feasible.'' 
 Nancy Ruddy, a principal of Cetra/Ruddy, the architectural and interior design firm handling the conversion, recalled that when she first walked through the existing building, it was ''in remarkably good condition and very solid,'' though it consisted ''of lots of teeny offices.'' 
 Ms. Ruddy said that while the structure's masonry walls, about 24 inches thick, and interior cast iron columns were assets when it came to adding the six stories, a steel platform was being built on the roof as a foundation for the addition.
 Gutting the interior, she added, was not an issue, since the office walls were made of sheetrock and came down easily.
 Ms. Ruddy said the addition would be modern in style to create ''a clear delineation of the old and new.'' The new structure will be clad in clear and frosted glass, metal panels and stainless steel that will reflect the sky, she said, and will look as though it is resting lightly atop the older limestone one.
 It will be capped, she said, with ''a modern interpretation of a cornice that respects the architectural order established by the existing building.''

HEADLINE: Waiting for Oedipus, Putting on a Show

BYLINE: By BEN BRANTLEY

 BODY:
In the world of Craig Lucas life is a scenic journey that eventually takes you right over a cliff. In darkly whimsical dramas like ''Prelude to a Kiss,'' ''Reckless'' and ''The Dying Gaul,'' Mr. Lucas has led theatergoers through witty, tantalizing obstacle courses before pushing them into the dark at the end of the tunnel.
 So perhaps it should come as no surprise to find that he has now enlisted Sophocles, that granddaddy of dramatic fatalism, as the tour guide for his latest play, ''Small Tragedy,'' which opened last night at Playwrights Horizons. The title of this searching, grandly imbalanced work, directed by Mark Wing-Davey, certainly gives its audience fair warning. So does a lyrical opening monologue that is filled with anticipatory dread. 
 Still, it's understandable if you're temporarily lulled into thinking that you're watching a more humane, less snarky version of the film ''Waiting for Guffman,'' Christopher Guest's satire about an amateur theater troupe. Here once again are a posturing, pretentious director whose favorite sound is his own voice and a group of eager, charmingly insecure actors of assorted eccentricities. They have come together to make sense of Sophocles' ''Oedipus Rex.'' Don't make the mistake of enjoying their company too much.
 In both its form and its story ''Small Tragedy'' explores the disconnect between a warm and cozy surface and the forbidding depths beneath. Specifically it considers the culture of denial and insularity that pervades American life and asks if such a society can accommodate a notion as vast as tragedy. Self-knowledge, predeterminism and willed blindness become the stuff of intense conversation during and between rehearsals of Sophocles' masterwork.
 Mr. Lucas triggers this complicated debate by placing two exotic figures of monumental gravity in the midst of a fretful theater company in a rehearsal hall in Cambridge, Mass. One is Sophocles' Oedipus; the other is the man hired to play him, Hakija (Lee Pace), a charismatic economics student.
 Hakija, it turns out, grew up in Bosnia. Suffering and tragic destiny are subjects he knows all about. Small wonder that everyone falls at least a little in love with him. That includes Nathaniel (Rob Campbell), the director; Jen (Ana Reeder), the production's infinitely vulnerable leading lady; and Christmas (Daniel Eric Gold), who is gay, dyslexic and full of gung-ho enthusiasm. This self-contained hothouse of a group is rounded out by Paola (a wonderfully tart Mary Shultz), Nathaniel's wife; and Fanny (Rosemarie DeWitt), Jen's defensive best friend.
 For its first act ''Small Tragedy'' is an impeccably sustained balance of the abstract and the particular, of the comic and the dramatic, as the characters define themselves and their relationships through the hurly-burly of auditions and rehearsal. Mr. Lucas has a shrewd ear for actorly anxiety and vanity. And the cast members generate a truly spontaneous sense of individual personalities and the erotic and intellectual conflicts that arise among them.
 By the middle of the second act, however, the density of ideas and plot starts to eclipse the characters. (Mr. Lucas has loaded Paola and Nathaniel, for example, with a labored personal history that embraces Hollywood deals, alcoholism, sexual game playing and H.I.V.) And in the rushed aftermath of the performance of ''Oedipus'' -- an ungainly and unintentionally semicomic production that improbably places Hakija on a fast track to stardom -- you're likely to feel cheated because people you have come to know have abruptly turned into dramatic pawns.
 ''Life is nothing if not predictable, if you read the clues and know how to put them together,'' Jen says in a monologue toward the play's end. It's true that Mr. Lucas plants plenty of hints early on for the revelations to come, but he doesn't manage to connect the dots convincingly. Surely he could have come up with a better means of disclosing one central character's harrowing secret than the forced device he uses here.
 Yet though it collapses under the weight of its ambitions, ''Small Tragedy'' is filled with provocative questions that American plays should be asking at a fraught and confusing moment in this country's history. Mr. Lucas appreciates that extreme times demand extreme theater. His habitual brooding fatalism has never seemed more relevant. If only he could convey that sensibility, as he has before, without betraying his characters.

HEADLINE: S.&P. and Dow Fall, Eroding Gains of Year-Old Rally

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
United States stocks declined yesterday, pushing the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average down for a fourth consecutive day, after bombs killed more than 190 people in Madrid. 
 The synchronized bombing of rush-hour trains gave further impetus to this week's sell-off. Benchmark indexes have fallen since a report last Friday showed a slower-than-expected increase in employment. 
 The S.&P. 500 shed 17.11 points, or 1.5 percent, to 1,106.78, placing it in negative territory for the year. The Dow average fell 168.51 points, or 1.6 percent, to 10,128.38. The Nasdaq composite index declined 20.26 points, or 1 percent, to 1,943.89, its fifth consecutive drop. It has declined 9.7 percent from a two-and-a-half year high on Jan. 26. The declines eroded some of the gains in a one-year rally that has pushed the three benchmarks up at least 35 percent since their 2003 lows a year ago today.
 Three stocks fell for every one that rose on the New York Stock Exchange. Some 1.9 billion shares changed hands on the Big Board, 30 percent more than the three-month daily average.
 Travel-related stocks slumped after news of the bombing. The Bloomberg United States Travel Index, made up of 36 companies that own hotels, airlines, cruise lines and travel agencies, lost 3.2 percent. That is the biggest drop since June 24.
 Continental Airlines fell 70 cents, to $12.27. Carnival, the world's largest cruise-line operator, lost $1.95, to $42.46. Its closest rival, Royal Caribbean, dropped $2.09, to $42.07. Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, owner of the Sheraton and Westin chains, lost $1.09, to $37.60.
 Halliburton fell $1.73, to $28.24. The federal government is conducting a criminal investigation into work done in Iraq by a Halliburton subcontractor.
 Stocks rose in the afternoon after the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, told a House committee that the economy was showing ''increasing signals of recovery'' that should increase job growth soon. The S.&P. 500 gained as much as 0.2 percent.
 ''We needed something good from Greenspan,'' said Richard I. Sichel, chief investment officer of Philadelphia Trust, which manages $1 billion. ''We are closer to seeing job growth; it is the first positive thing we've heard in a week.''
 The Target Corporation added $2.97, or 7.1 percent, to $44.70, for the biggest gain in the S.&P. 500. The company said it might sell the department stores to concentrate on its faster-growing namesake discount chain.
 United States Treasury notes rose after the attacks in Spain, rebounding from earlier losses. ''People want to move out of riskier assets when something like this happens,'' and move into a haven investment, said Paul Calvetti, head of United States Treasury trading at Barclays Capital in New York.
 By late in the day, the benchmark 10-year note rose 10/32 to 102 17/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 3.69 percent from 3.73 percent on Wednesday.
 Here are the results of yesterday's auction of 10-year notes:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)
Price: 102.034
High Yield: 3.752
Low Yield: 3.660

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

 BODY:
General Dynamics said yesterday that it had agreed to buy Alvis, the maker of the Challenger II battle tank, for $:309 million ($556 million). General Dynamics, based in Falls Church, Va., is offering 280 pence a share for Alvis, 33 percent more than the closing price on Wednesday. Alvis, based in London, will recommend the offer to shareholders, the chief executive, Nicholas Prest, said. Alvis, 29 percent owned by BAE Systems, also makes all-terrain mine-clearing and scouting vehicles. After the acquisition, General Dynamics, builder of the Abrams battle tank, expects to win combat vehicle orders from the United States, Britain and possibly Sweden. Alvis's shares rose 41 percent, to 296 pence.

HEADLINE: Cliff Freeman Sells Minority Stake to MDC

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS

 BODY:
Cliff Freeman & Partners in New York sold an undisclosed minority stake yesterday to MDC Partners in Toronto, a Canadian agency company that recently bought 60 percent of the Kirshenbaum Bond Creative Network in New York.
 Financial terms of the deal, which had been expected, were not disclosed. 
 The agreement includes an option for MDC to increase its stake in Freeman to 70 percent in about two years, said Miles Nadal, chairman and chief executive at MDC, adding that Freeman would operate autonomously under its current name.
 Freeman was opened in 1987 by Cliff Freeman, a copywriter and creative executive, under the ownership of Saatchi & Saatchi, which sold the agency to Mr. Freeman and other managers in 1999 for about $4.6 million. The deal is part of aggressive American expansion efforts by MDC, which in addition to its stake in Kirshenbaum Bond bought interests in Crispin Porter & Bogusky in Miami and Margeotes/Fertitta & Partners in New York.
 ''I've talked with everybody over the years'' about deals, Mr. Freeman said, ''but with this one I felt for some reason at home.'' His agency's clients include DSW shoe stores, Fox Sports, Sports Authority and the Turner Broadcasting System.

HEADLINE: Chinese Take Recklessly to Cars (Just Count the Wrecks)

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY

DATELINE: BEIJING, March 11 

 BODY:
For the aspiring motorists taking the driving exam at a government building not long ago, one true/false question probably seemed a touch unusual: If you come upon an auto accident and find a motorist lying unconscious on the road, should you shake that person violently to wake him up? 
 The next question expanded on the theme: If you come upon an accident and find a motorist lying unconscious on the road, and if that person's internal organs are also lying on the road, should you pick up the organs and put them back inside the person?
 The answers, presumably, are false and false.
 Yet if the questions seemed bizarre, the authors of the test, wittingly or not, were providing fair warning that China has become one of the world's most dangerous places to drive. 
 The country's booming economy has established China as the world's fastest growing car market. In Beijing alone, the number of vehicles jumped by more than 400,000 last year, a nearly 25 percent increase.
 But the flood of new cars and first-time drivers have contributed to a fivefold increase in road deaths in the past two decades.
 The roads are often terrible, the drivers are often worse. Traffic safety laws are roundly ignored and, until this year, were badly outdated.
 ''China's not like the United States, where cars have been a way of life for decades, and pedestrians and drivers have established practices,'' said Zhu Xiaomei, 29, a Beijing television producer. ''In China,'' she said, ''the one rule is: no one stops for anyone else. Pedestrians don't stop for cars, and cars don't stop for pedestrians.''
 The anarchic, wacky quality of driving in China might almost be comical if not for the horrific daily carnage. Last year, more than 104,000 people were killed in traffic accidents, roughly two and a half times more deaths than in the United States, even though China has far fewer vehicles. 
 The wrecks are often grotesque. Last Sunday, a busload of migrant workers careened off a mountain road in central China. Twelve died and 35 others were injured. A week earlier, a head-on collision involving a bus in southwest China left 11 dead and 20 injured. During the recent Chinese New Year holiday, one crash claimed at least 40 lives. 
 The maw of traffic can be intimidating to new drivers, some of whom attach small window signs that signal an inexperienced driver is behind the wheel.
 ''Novice drivers are the worst,'' said Tian Zhisheng, 60, as he walked his bicycle against a current of cars in northern Beijing. '' They'll drive right up onto the sidewalk and run you over.'' He added, ''I should put a sign on the back of my bike, 'I'm Old, Don't Hit Me.'' ' 
 China is furiously building highways and roads, but the transportation infrastructure is still woefully inadequate. Cities like Beijing and Shanghai, better designed for bicycles, are choked with traffic. Beijing alone has 63,000 taxis. One silver lining to the traffic is that the death rate is lower in cities. The cars are moving too slow.
 Li Dan, an official with the Chinese Center for Disease Control, said the majority of fatal accidents occur on more rural roads, often on the periphery of cities, where motorists travel faster. Often, these accidents involve passenger buses ferrying migrant workers or others from the countryside into the city. Last year, official statistics showed that China had 41 recorded accidents in which more than 10 people died.
 ''The most serious problem is between the urban and rural areas,'' Mr. Li said. He added, with a touch of understatement, ''There are a lot of things that need to be improved.''
 Within the past year, the Chinese government has taken steps to address the problem, though no one expects an overnight cure. Mr. Li noted that Prime Minister Wen Jiabao had set up a ministerial-level committee to improve road safety. The government has also approved new, nationwide traffic safety laws, scheduled to take affect in May.
 The Road and Traffic Safety Law, among other things, will provide for road signs to mark schools and hospitals. It also, for the first time, will establish that pedestrians have the right of way. Before, a pedestrian run over in an accident was often found at fault. The law will also set severe penalties for hit-and-run accidents, a major problem.
 Still, changing the prevailing culture will be difficult, and enforcing those changes even more so. By one estimate, there are only 200,000 traffic officers in all of China, a country of 1.3 billion people. 
 Violations abound. Some flatbed trucks are so overloaded that their tenuously strapped goods list precariously to one side. Last year, a Chinese newspaper reported that one man made a healthy wage by photographing violations in order to collect reward money from the police.
 Beside violations, ambulance service is spotty even in major cities, and people are often reluctant to call, since in the past the caller has often been responsible for the bill. (The new traffic law changes this.) 
 Nor has the average Chinese driver taken defensive driving to heart. Motorists routinely try to take left turns into four lanes of oncoming traffic in Beijing. Other motorists usually regard such a driver as a lead blocker and follow tightly behind in a vehicular wedge formation. On the outskirts of Beijing, many drivers, particularly in trucks, run red lights with abandon.
 If there is any good news, it is that the number of fatalities fell by about 5,000 from 2002 to 2003. The bad news, though, is that a possible reason for the drop was last year's SARS outbreak. For about two months, people simply stayed home. The roads were practically empty.

HEADLINE: U.S. Muffles Sweeping Call To Democracy In Mideast

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 11 

 BODY:
The Bush administration, yielding to protests from European and Arab leaders, has set aside its plan to issue a sweeping call for economic, political and cultural reform in the Middle East at a June conference of major industrial nations, American and Arab officials said Thursday.
 Because of Arab objections that such a call would give the appearance that change was being dictated from without, the officials said, the summit conference will instead proclaim its endorsement of reforms under way in the Middle East.
 Administration officials said they would work with European leaders to encourage Arab nations to proclaim their own reform measures before the meeting, which is to take place at Sea Island, Ga., with President Bush as host.
 On Wednesday, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell met with Jordan's foreign minister, Marwan Muasher, and discussed Jordan's attempt to persuade the Arab League to call for more open societies and democratic institutions at a meeting this month in Tunisia. 
 ''Reform is important and needed in the Arab world,'' Mr. Muasher said in an interview on Thursday. ''We agree with that completely. But for it to work we need ownership of the process, not a one-for-all blueprint from Washington.''
 A draft of the American call for change was circulated to some European countries and then leaked to Al Hayat, a London-based Arabic newspaper, in February -- all before the administration had shown it to Arab leaders, angering many of them.
 ''Our objective is for this document never to see the light,'' Mr. Muasher said of the draft. He said Secretary Powell had accepted the idea that the Sea Island meeting would not adopt the proposal.
 In recent years King Abdullah II of Jordan has led the way in encouraging independent political activities. The United States was so eager to highlight those reforms that it was considering inviting the king and leaders from Morocco, Bahrain and other countries to the meeting.
 That idea has receded, say various officials involved in planning the meeting. A European diplomat said there was a fear that those leaders would be viewed sneeringly as ''good students'' in the Arab world.
 A senior State Department official said that in his meeting with Mr. Muasher, Mr. Powell understood that ''nothing is going to work if it looks like it is being imposed'' and that aid, investment and trade preferences should be used to ''enhance'' the reforms under way.
 Another administration official said the lengthy draft published by Al Hayat was considered dead. It has been denounced by two close allies of Washington, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia. 
 ''All peoples by their nature reject whoever tries to impose ideas on them,'' Mr. Mubarak said.
 European leaders also criticized the draft, citing as well its failure to discuss the need for a peaceful end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
 The administration last week dispatched Marc Grossman, the under secretary of state for political affairs, to Europe and the Arab world.
 Mr. Muasher, who was visiting Washington on Thursday, said his comments reflected a ''broad consensus among the Europeans as well.''
 Mr. Powell, testifying before the House International Relations Committee, said the text in Al Hayat had caused much misunderstanding. The document, he said, was never intended to be anything more than a draft for discussion.
 ''I think we are now getting a better understanding with the Arab nations that it has to be something that comes from them,'' Mr. Powell said. ''If you don't want us to help, you don't want us to help.''
 Some administration officials said confusion had arisen because the administration had to draft its proposed declaration to be able to present it to Arab leaders, but by then it appeared to be a definitive pronouncement.
 The summit meeting will bring together the leaders of the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Canada and Russia, and leaders of the European Union.

Arafat Calls for Israeli Pullout
By The New York Times
 JERUSALEM, March 11 -- The Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, said Thursday that he would welcome an Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and parts of the West Bank, provided that it was coordinated with the Palestinians and was part of a broader peace effort.
 Mr. Arafat and other Palestinian leaders at first dismissed the proposal for unilateral action as a limited step intended to undermine a more comprehensive peace plan.
 Mr. Arafat reiterated the Palestinian demand for a full Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza.

PERSON: Robert D. Orr

HEADLINE: Robert D. Orr, 86, Governor Who Revamped Indiana Schools

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: INDIANAPOLIS, March 11 

 BODY:
Robert D. Orr, who championed an educational overhaul as governor of Indiana in the 1980's and later served as an ambassador to Singapore, died here on Wednesday. He was 86.
 The apparent cause was heart arrhythmia, said Mark Lubbers, Mr. Orr's former press secretary and longtime aide. Mr. Orr was admitted to the hospital for surgery because of an apparent kidney blockage, but his condition worsened, Mr. Lubbers said. In December, Mr. Orr underwent surgery for prostate and bladder cancer. 
 Mr. Orr, a Republican, spent 16 years in the state's top two offices, serving two terms as lieutenant governor beginning in 1973 and then as governor from 1981 to 1989. He was barred from a third term.
 After leaving office in 1989, he was named ambassador to Singapore.
 As governor, Mr. Orr presided over the strengthening of the state's economy after the recession of the early 1980's. He also oversaw the removal of the state license branch system from political control and an aggressive effort to promote the export of Indiana products -- a crusade he maintained long after leaving office.
 Mr. Orr's major achievement was passage of a sweeping educational overhaul package in 1987. The ''A-Plus'' package required student achievement exams, a new school accreditation system based on performance and rewards for schools that showed improvement.
 He also pushed two major tax increases through the General Assembly, one in 1982 to fix budget problems and one in 1987 to pay for the education program.
 Mr. Orr was born on Nov. 17, 1917, in Ann Arbor, Mich. He graduated from Yale in 1940 and attended Harvard Business School before enlisting in the Army in 1942. In World War II, he served in the Pacific Theater and was commissioned a major.
 He went to Evansville at the end of the war and entered the family business, the Orr Iron Company. He was Vanderburgh County Republican chairman and was elected to the State Senate in 1968 before being elected lieutenant governor.
 Mr. Orr is survived by his wife, the former Mary Kay Davis, whom he married in 2001, and three children from a previous marriage, to Joanne Wallace.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Warns Congress Not to Create Trade Barriers

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 11 

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, waded deeper into the political battle over jobs and trade on Thursday by warning Congress not to create trade barriers.
 ''We can erect walls to foreign trade and even discourage job-displacing innovation,'' Mr. Greenspan said. ''Tensions might appear to ease, but only for a short while. Our standard of living would soon begin to stagnate and perhaps even decline as a consequence.'' 
 On a day when President Bush continued to spar over trade and jobs with Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Mr. Greenspan aligned himself with Mr. Bush. 
 Mr. Greenspan disagreed with Mr. Kerry's proposal to link free-trade agreements with commitments by other countries to enforce tougher protections for workers and the environment.
 ''We are an ethical people, and I think we ought to essentially try to spread that around the world, but not use ethics as a guise for protectionism, which I fear in too many instances is really what it's all about,'' Mr. Greenspan told the House Education and Labor Committee.
 Mr. Kerry has vowed to subject trade treaties to an immediate 120-day review if he is elected president. He has also said he would roll back tax incentives that encourage corporations to move jobs overseas.
 Within hours of Mr. Greenspan's testimony, Mr. Kerry once again accused Mr. Bush of allowing manufacturing jobs to leave the country. Since January 2001, the economy has lost 2.2 million jobs. Job creation picked up again last August, but it remained at a near standstill in January and February.
 ''For every month that they've been in office, manufacturing jobs by the tens and hundreds of thousands and millions have been leaving the country,'' Mr. Kerry said Thursday after a meeting with Congressional Democrats.
 Mr. Greenspan pleaded with lawmakers for patience, predicting that job growth would accelerate ''reasonably quickly'' without protectionist measures.
 Invoking icons of free trade like the economist Joseph A. Schumpeter, who described capitalism as a process of ''creative destruction,'' Mr. Greenspan acknowledged that global competition was ''disruptive'' but said the United States had repeatedly prospered by being open and flexible.
 ''Time and again through our history, we have discovered that attempting merely to preserve the comfortable features of the present, rather than reaching for new levels of prosperity, is a sure path to stagnation,'' Mr. Greenspan said.
 Democrats quickly fired back. Mickey Kantor, a former secretary of commerce and top trade negotiator under President Bill Clinton, and now an adviser to Mr. Kerry, said Mr. Greenspan was too optimistic about the job market.
 Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said Mr. Greenspan was ignoring the need to fight unfair trade practices by China and other countries.
 ''Alan Greenspan should be focusing on all of the trade barriers that keep American companies from being able to compete,'' Senator Schumer said.

HEADLINE: Bush Campaigns on Long Island, Where Democrats Are Ascendant

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT and PATRICK HEALY

DATELINE: EAST MEADOW, N.Y., March 11 

 BODY:
With suburbia looming as a major political battlefield, President Bush came on Thursday to where it all began: Long Island, where the first modern suburb, Levittown, was born.
 For decades Republicans reigned here, exerting nationwide influence. As recently as the administration of Mr. Bush's father, the party's national chairman was a Long Islander, Richard Bond. 
 But now the suburbs have become a swing vote, and in the New York region lately they have been swinging more Democratic. For the first time, both county executives on Long Island are Democrats. So is the executive in Westchester County, a northern suburb.
 For both parties, wealthy Long Islanders are a mother lode mined by campaign treasurers.
 In his final stop Thursday night, President Bush collected more than $1 million for his campaign, charging $2,000 a head at a fund-raiser at the Carltun restaurant here. Those attending included Wall Street executives living on the North Shore.
 Democrats are sure to follow suit, especially in the Hamptons, the summer playground of liberal-leaning celebrities and business titans.
 The president's trip caused a big stir. ''This is the largest and most exciting thing that's ever happened to this town of Bay Shore,'' said Vincent Trapani, the owner of U.S.A. Industries in Bay Shore, as he welcomed Mr. Bush to a stage set amid factory assembly lines. ''We're ecstatic that you're here.''
 Mr. Bush talked about his economic policies and shared the microphone with selected executives and workers who told their success stories.
 But whether his tour changed any voters' minds is uncertain. Several Hispanic workers at the Bay Shore plant said that they were impressed to see Mr. Bush. But many were not fluent in English and did not understand all he said, and many are not citizens and thus cannot vote. 
 In an unscientific sampling at Mr. Bush's stops, people who said they voted for him before said they would do so again. Supporters of Al Gore four years ago said they intended to vote Democratic again.
 Chants of ''No more Bush'' vied with ''Four more years'' as demonstrators on both sides gathered at key points along the route.
 ''President Bush is one of the best presidents we've ever had,'' said Alfredo Montanez, holding aloft an American flag in Bay Shore, where he runs an appliance store. ''I hope we have him another four years. If it were up to me, I would give him eight.''
 But in the same crowd signs said: ''No blood for oil,'' ''Where Are the Jobs?'' ''Like father, like son, one term and you're done'' and ''Stop the 9/11 Cover-up.''
 Linda Beinhauer, a retiree from Central Islip, said she is a Republican, ''but he won't be getting my vote this year.'' She called Mr. Bush's opposition to gay marriage ''a smokescreen to divert attention from the issue of our jobs.''
 One wavering voter, Cheryl Shames, wore a shirt emblazoned with the image of her brother, Andrew Zucker, who died in the World Trade Center. Mr. Bush's appearance at the groundbreaking for a Sept. 11 memorial here was appropriately apolitical, she said, but ''his having 9/11 in his ads wasn't a positive thing.'' She added: ''I lost my brother that day. I don't think it should be part of his campaign. He's building on other people's grief.''
 Ms. Shames said she voted Democratic in 2000 but grew more at ease with Mr. Bush as president after Sept. 11. Now, she said, she's not sure whom to support.
 Although New York State is still considered a lock for the Democrats, William Kornblum, a sociologist at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, said Mr. Bush's appearance here was nonetheless politically shrewd. ''It's the same thing Kerry has to gain by going to Texas,'' Mr. Kornblum said, forcing the opposition to defend its home base.
 The Republican edge in voter enrollment is shrinking on Long Island. In the last 10 years, the Democratic Party has gained twice as many new members in Suffolk County as Republicans have. In Nassau, the ratio was more than three to one.
 The tension between traditional Republican power in the suburbs and the rising Democratic popularity will define the 2004 presidential race, said John H. Mollenkopf, director of the Center for Urban Research at the City University of New York's Graduate Center.
 ''Older suburbs are the battlegrounds for the next election,'' Mr. Mollenkopf said. ''Places like Nassau or Suffolk are going to define who wins the next election. That's where the votes are, and that's where the middle is.''

HEADLINE: Bush Campaign Goes on Attack in New Anti-Kerry Ads

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG and DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 11 

 BODY:
President Bush's re-election campaign will broadcast its first hard-hitting commercials against Senator John Kerry on Friday, attacking him as ''wrong on taxes, wrong on defense'' and accusing him of not sufficiently ''defending America.''
 The advertisements -- two for television and one on radio -- are the latest example of the White House's willingness to take on Mr. Kerry directly, abandoning the campaign strategy of his father and other presidents who tried to stay above the political fray.
 The Bush campaign presented the new advertisements on a day in which Mr. Bush joined former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York City and Gov. George E. Pataki of New York for the groundbreaking of a Long Island memorial to victims of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Democrats criticized the president last week for using images related to the attacks in an earlier round of campaign advertisements. 
 At a Long Island fund-raiser later in the day, Mr. Bush accused Mr. Kerry of running a campaign of anger and said that his opponent ''hasn't offered much about strategies to win the war'' on terrorism.
 Mr. Bush told the audience at the $2,000-a-ticket event in East Meadow that voters would face ''a choice between an America that leads the world with strength and confidence or an America that is uncertain in the face of danger.''
 The attacks on Mr. Kerry are part of an effort to define him on the Bush campaign's terms.
 But strategists and analysts from both parties said on Thursday that the strategy was risky because the confrontational approach might lead the public to view Mr. Bush's presidency in starkly political terms eight months before Election Day.
 ''They've made the decision on a risk-reward basis to do this,'' said Don Sipple, a Republican political consultant who was a consultant to Mr. Bush when he was governor of Texas. ''Obviously, it's an attempt to define Kerry in negative terms during this early period. The risk is that voters could view this as either irrelevant, unseemly or unbecoming of the president of the United States.''
 To help create such a view, Mr. Kerry went before cable news cameras even before the commercials were publicly released and said, ''There is a Republican attack squad that specializes in trying to destroy people and be negative.'' His campaign said it would respond with its own advertising as early as Friday.
 Complicating matters, however, Mr. Sipple said, are new federal election requirements that candidates appear in their own spots to voice approval for them, tying them more closely to their attack ads than ever before.
 Matthew Dowd, Mr. Bush's chief strategist, took issue with the notion that it was risky to begin a confrontational phase of the campaign now. He said that presidents who waited, among them Mr. Bush's father, had paid a price, while those who attacked early, like Bill Clinton, went on to win.
 ''This idea of a Rose Garden strategy is sort of false,'' Mr. Dowd said. ''Voters know he's running for re-election; they know Democrats have been attacking him.''
 In one of the new television commercials, Mr. Bush, without mentioning Mr. Kerry by name, tells voters that they face a choice between going ''forward with confidence, resolve and hope'' and turning ''back to the dangerous illusion that terrorists are not plotting and outlaw regimes are no threat.''
 In a second advertisement, an announcer warns that Mr. Kerry would ''weaken the Patriot Act used to arrest terrorists and to protect America'' and wanted to ''delay defending America until the United Nations approved,'' a reference to his calls for Mr. Bush to build a broader coalition among United Nations members on the eve of the Iraq war. 
 The spots will be complemented by a radio advertisement in which an announcer says, ''His plan to pay for new government spending will raise taxes at least $900 billion including taxes on small businesses -- costing jobs and reversing our economic recovery.'' 
 The spots were to run in the 18 states where Mr. Bush began advertising last week with three spots, two of them making reference to the Sept. 11 attacks. One of the commercials will remain on the air during the next week.
 Some Democrats called the new commercials an indication that the president was so far behind in polls that he felt the need to emerge from the dignity of the Oval Office to fight Mr. Kerry head on.
 ''They're squandering much of the advantage of incumbency and redefining Bush in an entirely political and partisan manner,'' said Jim Jordan, a spokesman for the Media Fund, a Democratic group running advertisements against Mr. Bush. ''This is an open confession that they know they'll lose any race that is remotely a referendum on the Bush presidency.''
 Mr. Bush's aides said he simply had to respond to months of attacks from Mr. Kerry, who was caught off-camera on Wednesday calling his opponents ''crooked'' and ''lying.'' 
 ''It's very important after seven months of attacks that we begin to frame the issues of the campaign,'' said a Bush campaign spokesman, Terry Holt. ''The president is well known; John Kerry is not. For the American people to make a good decision about this election we have to answer the question, Who is John Kerry?''
 The Republicans' efforts to contrast Mr. Bush's leadership skills with those of Mr. Kerry were also on display during the president's trip to Long Island.
 At the fund-raising event, which raised $1.6 million for the re-election campaign, Mr. Giuliani said that on Sept. 11 he repeatedly said to himself ''thank God'' President Bush was in office. Mr. Giuliani and Governor Pataki said they feared what might happen if Mr. Kerry held the post in a similar time of crisis.
 But outside, there was hardly that unanimity of view. Pat Kiefer came with a poster-sized photograph of her son Michael, a firefighter with Ladder Company 132 in Brooklyn who was killed at the World Trade Center.
 ''I have no faith in anyone,'' Ms. Kiefer told reporters on the edge of the crowd. ''The most important thing in my life was taken from me, and they could have prevented it.'' 
 Mr. Bush's advisers have said they are pleased so long as the campaign conversation remains focused on the Sept. 11 attacks and their aftermath, events they consider to be the defining moments of his presidency. That, they said, is why they are continuing to run the commercial evoking the day.

HEADLINE: Keeping Needed Cash Flowing to Relatives in Haiti

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
In the best of times, Boby Express, on a street corner in Flatbush, is a busy place, allowing Haitians in this Brooklyn neighborhood to send money to relatives back in Haiti for whom getting by is an everyday struggle.
 But the past four weeks have been far from the best of times.
 ''Everybody is desperate to send money,'' said Marie Chery, who manages the threadbare money transfer office on Flatbush Avenue near Clarendon Road. 
 With food deliveries in Haiti disrupted by the recent violence and prices multiplying three and four times for whatever foods are available, Haitians like Relax Desane are coming in more often to branches of Boby Express, CAM (Caribbean Air Mail) and dozens of other money transfer outlets to speed more cash to their beleaguered relatives in the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. 
 ''The trouble is that families suffer if we don't send money,'' said Mr. Desane, a 42-year-old barber who works a few doors down on Flatbush Avenue. ''People can't move around. They're scared. People are killing people.''
 He slipped $50 to a clerk behind the bulletproof-glass counter at Boby Express and gave the address of his mother, Marguerite Desut. When he was 12 in 1974, his mother urged him to go to the United States for a better life, and every couple of weeks he has been sending her, his brother, sister and cousins as much as $200 -- a big share of his earnings. 
 The uprising against the government of Jean-Bertrand Aristide is no distant thunder for the New York region's 205,000 Haitian-Americans, 74,000 of them in Brooklyn. Every eruption -- the conquest by rebels of the northern city of Gonaives, the siege of Port-au-Prince, the departure of Mr. Aristide, the appointment of a new prime minister -- has been broadcast to local Haitians by Radio Soleil d'Haiti, the city's Haitian newspapers and Haitian news Web sites like sakapfet.com, and has been felt as a personal jolt. 
 Arguing politics is like a daily workout for immigrants from a country that has suffered 32 coups in the 200 years since it became independent, and recent events are being debated particularly boisterously, usually in Creole, in every barber shop and restaurant in Flatbush. At Boss-Joug, a TV repair shop on Flatbush Avenue, Joseph Saillant, the owner, is worried that his relatives -- four brothers and three sisters -- ''could get killed for no reason'' by menacing street gangs known as chimeres that he said were encouraged by Mr. Aristide. But he will argue in rough but amiable fashion with Jean Robert Duchatelier, owner of the Silence restaurant a few doors down, who takes a more sympathetic view of the Aristide regime. 
 ''Duvalier was a saint compared to Aristide,'' Mr. Saillant said provocatively, invoking the name of Francois Duvalier, the dictator known as Papa Doc who ruled from 1957 to 1971. ''Since he's been in power, what's he done for Haiti?''
 ''I cook chicken and rice and beans -- I don't like politics,'' Mr. Duchatelier replied, smiling coyly and shifting a toothpick in his mouth. 
 But Haitians in the New York region are doing more than just debating academic questions -- they are taking urgent, tangible steps. When the Haitian phone system is working, they use cheap phone cards to call relatives to learn how their day was or whether the electric power is back on and to urge them to stay inside to avoid the bloodshed. 
 New Yorkers like Frantzy Theodule, who owns an electrical supply business, are trying to raise money to create a new town in Haiti that will become a model for future development. And almost every Haitian household here -- where the median income is $37,800 -- is sending cash so relatives can buy food, gasoline and medical supplies.
 For several days last week, the Haitian banking system was closed and money dropped off by Haitians here could not get delivered on the other end. Now these money transfers are going through again, often in minutes. 
 Oscar Herasme, executive director of the National Money Transmitters Association, an industry group based in Fort Lee, N.J., said a survey of members indicated that there has been a 10 percent to 15 percent jump in the amounts sent to Haiti since the troubles began a month ago. The 548,000 Haitians living in America sent $810 million back home in 2002, a quarter of the country's gross domestic product, Mr. Herasme said.
 Money handed over here can be picked up at outlets in Haiti, in either American dollars or Haitian gourdes, or delivered as actual food -- powdered milk, cooking oil, tomato paste, black and red beans and sugar -- to relatives' homes. Senders pay a handling fee of 9 percent for American dollars, 3 percent for gourdes and 6 percent for direct-delivered food. Until last month, money could be sent by messenger to a relative's home, but Ms. Chery of Boby Express, who came here 20 years ago and has business degrees from Brooklyn College, said that her company had stopped the service out of fear that messengers would get mugged. 
 Politically, the Haitian population in New York remains deeply divided even after Mr. Aristide's departure. He was beloved by many. But some prominent Haitians say there has been a shift in sentiment as a result of revelations of the lawlessness and corruption under his regime and brutal attacks by the chimeres.
 ''I do believe within the past month that a lot of pro-Aristide individuals have been increasingly changing their minds,'' said Regine Latortue, a professor of comparative literature in the Africana studies department at Brooklyn College and a second cousin of Haiti's new interim prime minister, Gerard Latortue.
 So close do Haitians here feel to the events in their home country that many of those interviewed spoke only on the condition that their full names not be used for fear of imperiling relatives. A 37-year-old clerk at Boby Express's Flatbush Avenue office gave his name only as Carl. He said he sends 40 percent of his salary not just to support relatives, but also to help friends. Haiti, after all, is a place where people share what little they have.
 ''God will send the money back,'' Carl said, smiling.

HEADLINE: An M.R.I. Machine For Every Doctor? Someone Has to Pay

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON

DATELINE: SYRACUSE 

 BODY:
This aging city is an unexpected epicenter for a high-tech medical arms race. But employers and insurers here say that is just what they are paying for, as doctors, their traditional sources of income squeezed, discover a new one: diagnostic imaging. 
 Instead of sending patients to a radiologist or one of four local hospitals, doctors in Syracuse have been particularly aggressive about installing imaging equipment -- particularly M.R.I. machines -- in their own offices.
 Nationally, diagnostic imaging, which also includes CT and PET scans, is approaching a $100-billion-a-year business, according to a recent report by the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, using estimates from the consultant Booz Allen Hamilton, up about 40 percent just since 2000. 
 Indeed, while insurers have long paid the greatest attention to the rising costs of drugs and hospital stays, they are becoming increasingly concerned about imaging. ''There's so much entrepreneurship here that is superseding what is truly needed,'' said Dr. Allan Korn, the chief medical officer for the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association. ''It's becoming a huge problem.'' 
 In the Syracuse area, the number of magnetic resonance imaging machines has grown by a third over the last three years. In the 12 months ended last June alone, use of M.R.I. scans in the area increased 23 percent, according to National Imaging Associates, a company that works with insurers to manage costs. 
 Competing hospitals and radiologists complain that the imaging upstarts -- orthopedic surgeons, cardiologists, neurologists and others -- are performing services that the radiologists say they do better and that the hospitals say they already provide. They also point to a regulatory environment, on the state and federal levels, which restricts their business but, they say, gives the new competitors free rein to expand. 
 No one disagrees that much of the recent growth in diagnostic imaging is a result of medical advances that allow doctors to better discover what is wrong with a patient or to avoid more invasive procedures, like exploratory surgery. And many patients prefer not having to leave their doctor's office to get an M.R.I.
 ''This is nothing more than changing times -- we have to change,'' said Dr. I. Michael Vella, the president of Syracuse Orthopedic Specialists, the largest orthopedic surgery practice here, with 23 doctors in eight offices across Syracuse. 
 In a building at the edge of a shopping mall that the practice renovated last summer into its main office, the doctors have installed two M.R.I. machines and a nuclear camera, equipment made by General Electric that costs millions of dollars. 
 That is part of a proliferation of M.R.I. machines here, whether in the hospital, at free-standing imaging centers or in doctors' offices. The five counties surrounding Syracuse have 27 M.R.I. machines, up from 20 just three years ago, according to Excellus BlueCross BlueShield, the area's major insurer. Four more are said to be in the works. 
 ''There is just too much equipment,'' said Dr. Patrick J. Lynch, a local radiologist who complains that many specialists are investing in the machines as a way to increase their incomes.
 Employers are also concerned. ''Unfortunately, it's the business community that pays for these,'' said John P. Driscoll, who heads a task force on health care set up by the Metropolitan Development Association of Syracuse and Central New York, a group of business leaders here. 
 Scans, of course, are not inexpensive. While prices vary widely, a typical PET might cost $2,000, while an M.R.I. would cost $700 to $900 and a CT, or computed tomography, scan would cost $500 to $700, according to National Imaging Associates. The tests are frequently covered by insurance, however, so patients would often pay much less, depending on their plan. 
 There are signs that more machines may translate into too much imaging. Excellus points to data that suggest use of M.R.I.'s in Syracuse is two-thirds higher than in Rochester, for example, and higher than the national average. 
 ''There tends to be more self-referral in the Syracuse market,'' said John J. Donahue, the chief executive of National Imaging Associates, based in Hackensack, N.J. 
 But the phenomenon is national. Imaging is the fastest-growing component of physician services in the Medicare program, according to research by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, an independent federal body that helps Congress evaluate care. Average use per Medicare beneficiary for imaging rose at nearly three times the rate of overall use of doctors' services from 1999 to 2002. And the program's spending on imaging is up about 50 percent over the last five years, versus a 30 percent rise in Medicare's overall costs. 
 ''We share the concern about the possibility for overutilization in imaging technology,'' said Dr. Sean Tunis, the chief clinical officer for Medicare. In a departure from previous policy, Medicare has approved positron emission tomography -- or PET -- scans, which take images using radioactive compounds, for only certain uses, like the diagnosis of thyroid cancer. Medicare is conducting a pilot program before deciding whether to cover scans for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.
 Policy analysts say that doctors have strong financial incentives to provide diagnostic imaging and other so-called ancillary services, like lab tests. 
 ''A lot of the impetus comes from the financial pressure physicians are feeling,'' said Dr. Hoangmai H. Pham, a senior health researcher at the Center for Studying Health System Change and one author of a study on physician entrepreneurship that appears in the current issue of Health Affairs, an academic journal. ''Physicians' strategies threaten to raise costs for public and private payers through increased use,'' the study warns. 
 Both specialists and primary care doctors are offering more imaging services, according to research by the Medical Group Management Association, an Englewood, Colo., group that represents large medical practices. Doctors' billings for radiology services climbed 75 percent among family practice groups from 1998 to 2002, while doubling for cardiology groups, the association found.
 ''There are a lot of forces creating this trend,'' including the desire to offer patients convenient and efficient care, said Dr. William F. Jessee, the chief executive of the association. Being able to make a diagnosis and develop a plan for treatment while the patient is still in the office also saves physicians' time, he said.
 As the price of even high-end equipment has come down in recent years, doctors, especially those in large groups, are finding it easier to afford an M.R.I. machine. A typical unit might cost $1.4 million, but doctors can often borrow the money or lease the equipment. Some save money by buying smaller machines that can scan a knee, for example, or purchase used equipment. While payments vary widely, doctors often collect $500 to $700 for a typical M.R.I. done on an outpatient basis in this area. 
 In Syracuse, there have been attempts to discourage the purchase of imaging equipment. In July 2000, Excellus put a moratorium on paying new providers for M.R.I. services. ''We did have some impact on capacity,'' said James R. Smith, Excellus's regional president for central New York.
 But what makes the city particularly vulnerable to a proliferation in equipment is New York's regulatory structure. While hospitals and licensed centers must petition for approval to purchase imaging equipment under the state's certificate-of-need laws, physicians who want to operate the same machines in their offices face no such restrictions. 
 And in some cases, physicians may be in a better position to buy the equipment than the hospitals, as many of the institutions struggle to make ends meet. For example, Crouse Hospital here, which recently emerged from bankruptcy, formed a partnership with the area's largest provider of M.R.I. services, Magnetic Diagnostic Resources of Central New York, to offer M.R.I.'s on hospital grounds.
 ''You either fight them or joint- venture with them,'' said David Speltz, the former chief executive of Crouse, who was brought in to turn the hospital around and remains an adviser. In this case, the hospital could not afford the full cost of the equipment by itself.
 But some executives voice concern about the migration of imaging and other money-making services from their hospitals to physicians' offices. Syracuse hospitals have already felt the impact of doctors and others opening up free-standing surgical centers; the four hospitals experienced an 11 percent drop in ambulatory surgeries from 2001 to 2003, according to the Hospital Executive Council, a local planning group. 
 The competition, some executives acknowledge, fuels duplication of services. 
 ''You have to stay in the race; you have to do it,'' said Ben Moore III, executive director of the University Hospital in Syracuse.
 State officials have been studying some of these concerns. But because the activities of doctors are largely outside the state health department's purview, regulators do not even know how many M.R.I. machines there are in New York. 
 ''We recognize that is, was and will continue to be an issue that we need to deal with and the health care system in New York needs to deal with,'' said Wayne Osten, a state health official. As part of a review of the state's Medicaid system ordered by Gov. George E. Pataki, a working group has begun looking at the migration of services from hospitals to outpatient centers and doctor's offices. 
 But radiologists and others are also troubled by the potential conflict that arises when doctors make money from every test they recommend. Radiologists perform scans on referrals from other doctors. 
 While federal regulations, under the so-called Stark Law, generally forbid doctors from sending patients to imaging centers or labs in which they have a financial interest, doctors are allowed to own and operate equipment in their offices.
 ''There is nothing they can do about the office,'' said Jean M. Mitchell, a professor and health economist at Georgetown Public Policy Institute who has studied the possible conflicts. 
 Efforts in Syracuse to address the continuing buildup in the medical arms race focus largely on having hospital executives, doctors, insurers and others communicate among themselves about the region's needs. But Dr. Vella of Syracuse Orthopedic Specialists, for one, is uneasy about a community planning process that would allow access to technology for some providers but not others.
 ''I don't think that you should limit the use of technology, limit competition,'' he said.
 Mr. Driscoll, the business leader, expects significant resistance from other doctors, as well. 
 ''The doctors have the most to lose,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Light Rail, With the Emphasis on Light

BYLINE: By LAURA MANSNERUS

DATELINE: TRENTON, March 12 

 BODY:
From rail yards in Camden and Trenton, cars will roll out on Sunday morning for the very first trip on what transportation experts say will be the light rail line with the worst financial performance in the nation. 
 The people along a string of shrinking towns on the Delaware River are expected to make about 5,900 one-way trips a day on New Jersey Transit's new River Line. Each trip will cost New Jersey taxpayers about $30 to cover operating costs and debt service. And the state has already sunk $1 billion into the project. 
 Light rail -- this generation's name for streetcars and trolleys -- has been introduced or revived in about 20 American cities in the last 20 years, drawing attention with a winning combination of nostalgia and novelty. How well these lines have worked is a subject of fierce debate; few if any pay for themselves. But even the state transit officials in charge of it say the River Line is a cautionary tale. 
 At a time when the state treasury is bare and New Jersey Transit in particular is starving, the River Line, which will carry fewer than 1 percent of the agency's passengers, is expected to drain about $65 million a year from the transportation funds allotted for the entire state. 
 ''There is a desire named streetcar among planners,'' said James Dunn, a political scientist at Rutgers who studies public transit. But if lightly traveled light rail lines do little to serve transportation needs, that is almost beside the point for the political officials who want to build them, he said. 
 In the political sphere, ''it's a benefits regime'' that distributes jobs, contracts and influence, Professor Dunn said. ''The costs are the benefits.''
 And the River Line illustrates those costs. 
 The line was a notion of the 1990's, when light rail was catching on across the country. New Jersey approved a 20-mile line along the Hudson, from Bayonne to Bergen County, and obtained federal funds that would eventually pay for most of it. South Jersey legislators responded with a plan for the 34-mile Camden-to-Trenton line, a proposal little noticed in the flush, free-spending years of Gov. Christie Whitman's administration, and that was approved, too. Most of the old rail line that would carry the light rail was in Burlington County, home of State Senator C. William Haines, the chairman of the Transportation Committee, who died in 1996.
 One critical distinction of the South Jersey line was that the state made no application for federal aid. ''The true scandal of all this is they knew it was bad to begin with and didn't want it evaluated objectively,'' said Prof. John Pucher of Rutgers, a transit expert who describes himself as a proponent of light rail. 
 The project has cost about three times more than the earliest estimates. Since 1996, the state has paid $476 million for the contract to design and build the system and $100 million for consultants. In borrowing to keep the project afloat, the state paid outside bond underwriters and lawyers, although those costs are minuscule in comparison to the $48 million a year to be paid in debt service. 
 Officials in Gov. James E. McGreevey's administration, having inherited the River Line, thought about abandoning the project and then about letting people ride free, reasoning that the fares -- $1.10 per trip -- would not cover the cost of collecting them. 
 George Warrington, the director of New Jersey Transit, says the light rail line will have no noticeable effect on traffic congestion. ''But at the same time, I have what I have,'' Mr. Warrington said. ''I need to make the best of it and make it as attractive as possible.''
 Like many of the River Line's supporters, Mr. Warrington describes it as an economic development project for the river towns, most of which lost population in the 1990's, even while Burlington County grew by 7.2 percent. State Route 130, paralleling the River Line, remained an underused highway lined with auto-body shops and storage businesses. 
 But the Victorian flavor of villages like Bordentown and Riverside invited downtown renewal. ''Private capital is gravitating back to downtowns across the state, and the anchor for much of that attraction is the train station,'' Mr. Warrington said.
 Mark Remsa, Burlington County's director of economic development, said that about $480 million in new construction was planned within walking distance of the line or of shuttle buses to the stations from employment centers. 
 Mr. Remsa said it was almost impossible to tell whether the River Line would simply siphon development from not-too-distant points, or even from Route 130, just as it would siphon passengers from Camden-to-Trenton bus service. ''But we have seen property values rising,'' he said, ''particularly along the tracks, and a lot of people who say they're here because of the light rail.''
 Even opponents say that Camden and Trenton can only benefit from the line. But some potential riders will not ride the line to Trenton because it stops about a mile from the State House. In Camden, scheduling is a problem. The terminus is across the street from the Tweeter Center, a major concert hall, but the line runs late only on Saturdays; on other days, because the right-of-way is shared with freight traffic, the last train leaves at 9 p.m. 
 Criticism of the project reflects a wider, impassioned dispute over the efficacy of mass transit and of light rail in particular. Clifford Winston, an economist at the Brookings Institution, argues that public ownership of transit is governed by political -- and therefore hugely expensive -- spending decisions, and that planners routinely overestimate demand for new projects. ''I do mind how much these things cost,'' Mr. Winston said, ''but I mind more when no one uses them.'' 
 In this debate, the River Line is often singled out for derision. In a new study titled ''Great Rail Disasters,'' published in Colorado by the Independence Institute, a libertarian research organization, the author, Randal O'Toole, said, ''The South Jersey rail line is so bad that it is almost a New Jersey caricature of everything wrong with rail transit.''
 Many transit advocates respond that mass transit serves purposes beyond dollar-for-dollar efficiency and that new rail development invites other investments that transform their surroundings. Mr. Warrington cites the example of Metropark, the rail station that was widely labeled a boondoggle when it was built on farmland in Edison, N.J., and is now a sizable job center.The new Hudson-Bergen light-rail line has been much disparaged, too, but ridership and revenue are growing quickly as construction extends the line to transit hubs like the Hoboken bus and rail terminal. 
 The comparison of the Trenton-to-Camden line and other light-rail lines around the nation is even more stark. At the projected 2.1 million trips a year, ridership on the River Line would be far below the least successful new projects: Buffalo's 6-mile-long light rail (about 5.8 million trips a year) and San Jose's 29-mile line (about 7.8 million trips a year). Among the more successful lines, St. Louis has almost 15 million trips a year, Dallas 13.7 million, and San Diego more than 25 million. 
 The projected farebox receipts for the River Line -- $1.4 million in the first year -- fall far below any other new line's revenue. Given $18 million to $19 million in operating and maintenance costs, fares will cover about 7 percent of costs and require a subsidy of just over $8 per trip. When the $48 million debt service is added, the recovery is 2 percent and the subsidy $31 per trip.
 The River Line has proven painful to many public-transit advocates, who do not want to discourage new investment or the delicate progress that rail lines are bringing to urban centers.
 Professor Pucher at Rutgers, who does not even own a car, calls the River Line ''probably the worst transit investment in the entire country.'' 
 ''I'm really upset because it's just bankrupting New Jersey Transit,'' he said. ''It's going to postpone desperately needed improvements in North Jersey. The trains are overflowing. We need another tunnel into Manhattan. We need double-decker trains.''
 Like many transportation experts, Mr. Pucher said areas like South Jersey, where development is scattered, are much better and more cheaply served by buses. But bus service is notoriously hard to sell, he added. ''Even the Federal Transit Administration has said that the main problem with buses is they don't look like trains.''

HEADLINE: A Red Planet Forever in the Orbit of Science and Dreams

BYLINE: By KIM STANLEY ROBINSON. 
Kim Stanley Robinson is a science-fiction writer. His new novel, ''Forty Signs of Rain'' (Bantam), is to be published in June.

 BODY:
Mars and science fiction came of age together in the 1890's, and ever since they have had a tight relationship, a feedback loop that has made both famous.
 It began with the American astronomer Percival Lowell, who built a technically advanced telescope and through it saw straight lines on the surface of the red planet. He explained that these had to be the canals of an alien race whose planet was drying out, forcing them to convey water from the polar caps, also visible.
 Of course Lowell's elaborately postulated Martian culture was a kind of self-hypnosis, in effect a science-fiction novel already. But his speculative leap from limited evidence was not that different in method from the archaeology of Schliemann at Troy, or Sir Arthur Evans at Knossos. And so his Mars was widely accepted as a possibility based on real data. 
 The news galvanized the world. Other writers immediately recognized that if there really were a civilization on Mars, it could be anything; Lowell's version was only one guess. Quickly other Martian fictions appeared in all the leading industrial nations, and many had a major impact. In Germany Kurd Lasswitz's ''Two Planets'' (1897) sold several hundred thousand copies, and clubs formed to discuss it. Lasswitz described a Martian technological utopia, enjoying great domestic comfort through advances in food production, transport, urban planning and space travel. Young men like Wernher von Braun and Willy Ley were greatly impressed, so much so that they later became rocket scientists. It could even be said that it was Lowell's imagination that got us to the moon by 1969.
 In Russia the book was ''Red Star,'' by Aleksandr Bogdanov. Here the utopia is political, though also technically advanced. Mars's socialist civilization has been living in peace for five centuries, but when it sends emissaries to Earth, terrible problems arise. Can social progress be imposed on a less developed culture? 
 This very impressive novel, written in 1908, considers this and other questions while offhandedly predicting much of 20th-century history. It, too, inspired clubs, debates, professional and amateur sequels, and a generation of young scientists, including engineers in the Soviet space program.
 A decade earlier in England, H. G. Wells considered what might happen if this advanced Martian civilization decided to come here and take our water, which would be as valuable to Martians as oil is to us. Wells intended ''War of the Worlds'' to remind British readers of the recent massacre of the Tasmanian aborigines -- while putting them at the wrong end of the gun.
 In the United States, on the other hand, the pulp-action adventures of Edgar Rice Burroughs's John Carter series abjured any heavy political message, except perhaps the idea that it would be fun to live in a fantasy Wild West forever, especially if you could leap much higher than the bad guys.
 Thus from the turn of the 20th century through the 1920's, many scientifically literate people considered a Martian civilization quite possible, and fiction speculating about it was widespread and influential. By the end of the 1930's, however, the scientists were shaking their heads. Radio telescopes were revealing that the Martian atmosphere was extremely thin, and had neither oxygen nor water. Not only was civilization unlikely, but life itself looked as if it would have a hard time as well. And then Orson Welles's radio dramatization of ''War of the Worlds'' scared people and was declared a hoax, and this somehow debunked the whole idea.
 What came after could be called Mars's dry era. Writers still wrote about the planet, and they still included aliens, but they were reduced by the new theory to postulating creatures like sentient tumbleweed or telepathic lichen beds. Arthur C. Clarke's ''Sands of Mars'' is a good example of this, and Philip K. Dick's ''Martian Time-Slip'' uses the desiccated Mars as another version of the 20th century's spiritual wasteland.
 A different response to the dry Mars scenario appeared in Ray Bradbury's ''Martian Chronicles.'' Bradbury grasped that although Lowell had been wrong, and that whole world had been lost, the stories it had generated would endure, so that whenever humans arrived on Mars, a ghost culture would already be there, ready to haunt them. This is a story that will always be true.
 The Mariner and Viking missions in the 1960's and 70's gave us the actual place, all at once, fully photographed and mapped: its spectacular, gigantic landscape features were astonishing, like a dream of Monument Valley. There were clear signs of water, yet the landers indicated that the planet was entirely lifeless. Empty but real -- what an opportunity.
 These very findings were also part of what stimulated planetary scientists like Carl Sagan to begin discussing terraforming: altering a planet until it could support an Earthlike biosphere. As these first terraforming theorists pointed out, Mars would be the perfect candidate for the process. We could start a new Earth.
 A flood of Mars terraforming novels soon followed, mine among them. Combining Viking's data with terraforming theory created an imaginative space as rich as that of Lowell's Mars, or richer, because with the aliens finally gone, the story became so clearly about us. Humanity on a rocky planet, trying to tend a biosphere. It was not only possible but necessary to consider wilderness, sustainability, ecology, economics, social justice, utopia -- in short, all the things novels should talk about, and all laid out with marvelous clarity on the clean slate of Mars. It was a lucky time to be writing science fiction.
 Now some kind of post-Viking era in Mars thinking has already arrived, marked by the return of the possibility of life, this time in the form of bacteria underground. This possibility changes the terraforming proposal a great deal: bringing life to a dead rock is not the same as intruding on an already existing biosphere.
 Meanwhile, the feedback loop between science and science fiction continues to flow. It is, as we have seen, an elliptical loop, like the orbit of a comet. Science-fiction writers seize on new scientific findings and immediately leap to conclusions, in the form of stories. Then these stories dive into young minds and percolate there, shaping future scientists and giving them dreams, visions, plans.
 Leap and percolate. These days I sometimes hear from young people who tell me they are studying some kind of science because of my Mars books. (''But you forgot to mention the math.'') I feel like part of the science-fiction loop. I still follow the latest Mars news, and sometimes I wonder what the next wave of Mars stories will be like.
 It seems awkward. I suppose the thing to do would be to tell the story of the robot rovers, because that's what we're going to have for a while. Maybe rovers much more powerful than Spirit and Opportunity -- artificial intelligences, in fact, and happy to be on Mars, because it's the world they were designed for, and they're protecting an indigenous cryptoendolithic, or hidden in rock, bacterial culture they have discovered. So that when humans finally arrive in person, it's a disaster in the making for all concerned, and the rover artificial intelligences and little red people have to play dumb and play ghost and change humanity for the good of all, and . . . 
 On the stories will go.

To the Editor:
 Paul Krugman's March 9 column, ''Promises, Promises,'' proves that a picture -- in this case, a graph tracking employment figures compared with the Bush administration's job growth predictions -- is worth a thousand words. 
 I am an economist with long experience working with economic projections in low-income countries. I learned long ago to take such forecasts with several grains of salt, but never did I expect the United States government to fall prey to such nonsense. 
 After three years of the Bush administration, I have the same response to its pronouncements as I do to those from some of the countries I have worked in: ''Is that a projection by the government? Well, then, why would anyone who isn't on its payroll even pretend to believe a word of it?''

HEADLINE: Low Labor Standard Leads South Africans to Export Jobs

BYLINE: By SHARON LaFRANIERE

DATELINE: BABELEGI, South Africa 

 BODY:
When Tiger Wheels opened a wheel plant six years ago in this faded industrial town, the crush of job seekers was so enormous that the chief executive, Eddie Keizan, ordered a corrugated iron roof to shield them from the midday heat.
 ''There were hundreds and hundreds of people outside our gate, just sitting there, in the sun, for days and days,'' Mr. Keizan recalled in an interview. ''We had no more jobs, but they refused to believe us.''
 The little shelter might just be the last expansion of this South African company's operations here. It is hiring again, but not in South Africa, where one person in four is jobless. Instead, it has a new plant in Alabama, is looking to open another in China and may expand its subsidiary's factory in Poland. 
 South Africa's failure to keep jobs at home and to stimulate new ones is turning into one of the biggest disappointments of the post-apartheid era.
 After black majority rule triumphed 10 years ago, the government bent over backward to attract businesses to an economy weakened by the export of capital and a global boycott during apartheid. It cut inflation, liberalized trade and reduced the budget deficit.
 But sound economic policies have not compensated for unskilled workers, high labor costs, crime, AIDS, the specter of a collapsing Zimbabwe on the northern border, and the fact that Africa is, simply put, a bad business address. 
 Today, South Africa's underclass is bigger than ever. Counting those who have given up the search for work, unemployment has jumped to more than 40 percent, from 31 percent a decade ago. The gap between rich and poor remains one of the world's largest.
 ''If things go on like this, we could experience a new struggle, a class struggle,'' said Sampie Terreblanche, an economist with the University of Stellenbosch, who sees the lack of jobs as the biggest threat to the pact that has bound blacks and whites together in the new South Africa. 
 The challenges to growth are demonstrated aptly enough by Tiger Wheels. For 20 years the company made aluminum wheels only in South Africa. Then, in 1994, its German subsidiary opened a factory in Poland that now employs 500 people. 
 The Polish plant turns a profit. The South African plant, with 700 workers, either breaks even or loses money, Mr. Keizan said. The main reason, he said, is that the Polish workers -- much better educated but paid the same wage as the South Africans -- make fewer mistakes.
 For every 60 wheels cast at the South African plant, three must be melted down and recast, 30 percent more than at the Polish plant, he said. In his view, that is because 9 out of 10 of his South African workers never finished high school, while the same proportion of the Polish workers have university degrees. One-fifth of the South African workers can neither read nor work a simple calculator, he said.
 Martin Glatt, a co-chairman of Tiger Wheels, said it would be costly to train the South African workers to the level of the Polish workers. Not only are the Poles more efficient; they are also healthier. At its South African plant, Tiger Wheels loses one worker a month to AIDS.
 ''You can say that's only 12 a year, out of a work force of 700,'' Mr. Keizan said. ''But it's the 30-to-45-year age group. Each one of them has accumulated years of skill and understanding of what they do. It's horrible.''
 That pain is widely shared. One-third of South African companies report that AIDS has lowered profits, according to a recent survey by a business coalition. Economists estimate that AIDS cuts one percentage point off the growth of South Africa's gross domestic product. 
 That translates into a loss of jobs that the country can ill afford. 
 The large number of applicants for jobs at a new marine park in Durban last month is a sign of the growing desperation of the underclass. About 10,000 people showed up to apply for 300 openings as guards, cashiers, cleaners and information officers. When the crowd surged toward the gate, 17 people were crushed against a steel fence and had to be hospitalized. About 100 others were injured.
 President Thabo Mbeki, facing an election next month, has promised a $2 billion, five-year program to employ a million people to build roads, sidewalks and pipelines. But that cannot make up for lack of growth in the private sector, where many companies are still playing it safe. 
 The economy's annual growth rate of 2.8 percent is less than half what the government predicted after apartheid fell. 
 Fayez Omar, who runs the World Bank's operations in South Africa, said those expectations were simply too high. ''It was unrealistic of anybody to expect that you would stabilize the economy one year and start growing the next,'' he said in an interview. ''The government has done the right thing. They have laid the foundation for a takeoff.'' 
 But even optimists like Mr. Omar do not predict any takeoff soon, given the lack of skills in the work force, labor restrictions and other obstacles. 
 Apartheid left millions of blacks with little education and no trades. Nearly 60 percent of those who are jobless have never worked, according to the National Labor and Economic Development Institute.
 In other developing countries, legions of unskilled workers have kept down labor costs. But South Africa's leaders, vowing not to let their nation become the West's sweatshop, heeded the demands of politically powerful labor unions for new protections and benefits. According to a study conducted in 2000 for the government's finance department, South Africa's wages are five times higher than Indonesia's, even though its workers are only twice as productive. 
 In Johannesburg, at least, executives say crime is also a deterrent. In a World Bank survey in 2000, heads of major manufacturers in or near the city said crime and violence were the biggest reasons their companies did not expand. 
 For foreign investors, in particular, Africa's image is still another hurdle. South Africa's financial stewards, banking system and ports may be first world, but the nation itself still rests in a continent stained by corruption, war, poverty and, in neighboring Zimbabwe, political and economic collapse.
 Mr. Keizan and the other members of the Tiger Wheels board say they weighed all those factors and others in deciding where to build plants. Foremost among them was the desire of the company to present itself as a global producer. That meant starting operations in the bigger markets in Europe and the United States. 
 Its plans for South Africa are modest: keeping 700 jobs at the Babelegi plant, an hour's drive north of Johannesburg, but cutting costs. In the past, that has not been easy.
 Three years ago, when the factory was struggling financially, Mr. Keizan said, the company tried to freeze wages. After the workers staged a three-day strike, an arbitrator ruled that they were entitled to the same wage increase negotiated by an industrywide union.
 Mr. Glatt, the co-chairman, later compared the South African factory's problems with the more efficient operation in Poland. 
 ''Tell me, where should we make our next investment?'' he asked at a conference on how to create jobs in South Africa. ''Look, I'm sad about this, but tell me, which way is our board going to vote?''

HEADLINE: Brown U. to Examine Debt to Slave Trade

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK

DATELINE: PROVIDENCE, R.I., 

 BODY:
When Ruth J. Simmons became the president of Brown University nearly three years ago, one striking fact could not be overlooked.
 A great-granddaughter of slaves, Dr. Simmons was the first African-American president of an Ivy League university. But the 240-year-old university she was chosen to lead had early links to slavery, with major benefactors and officers of it having owned and traded slaves.
 ''It certainly didn't escape me, my own past in relationship to that,'' Dr. Simmons said in a telephone interview in early March. ''I sit here in my office beneath the portrait of people who lived at a different time and who saw the ownership of people in a different way. You can't sit in an office and face that every day unless you really want to know, unless you really want to understand this dichotomy.'' 
 Now, Dr. Simmons, whose office is in a building constructed by laborers who included slaves, has directed Brown to start what its officials say is an unprecedented undertaking for a university: an exploration of reparations for slavery and specifically whether Brown should pay reparations or otherwise make amends for its past.
 Dr. Simmons has appointed a Committee on Slavery and Justice, which will spend two years investigating Brown's historic ties to slavery; arrange seminars, courses and research projects examining the moral, legal and economic complexities of reparations and other means of redressing wrongs; and recommend whether and how the university should take responsibility for its connection to slavery.
 Dr. Simmons, one of 12 children of an East Texas tenant farmer and a house cleaner, said she was motivated by a sense that the multifaceted subject of reparations had too often been reduced to simplistic and superficial squabbles.
 ''How does one repair a kind of social breach in human rights so that people are not just coming back to it periodically and demanding apologies,'' she said, ''so that society learns from it, acknowledges what has taken place and then moves on. What I'm trying to do, you see, in a country that wants to move on, I'm trying to understand as a descendant of slaves how to feel good about moving on.''
 Dr. Simmons does not believe that her history will sway the inquiry. ''I don't think there can be a person with a better background for dealing with this issue than me,'' she said. ''If I have something to teach our students, if I have something to offer Brown, it's the fact that I am a descendant of slaves.''
 Both Dr. Simmons and the chairman of the committee, James T. Campbell, a history professor at Brown, said the effort would be wide ranging and thorough, encouraging all points of view.
 ''Everyone in a university is always being accused of being 18 miles to the left of the country,'' said Dr. Campbell, who specializes in American, African-American and African history, but ''there are people on this committee who think reparations is the stupidest idea ever.''
 Dr. Campbell, who said he had conflicting feelings about reparations, said the committee was expecting criticism from both the right and the left.
 ''You're going to have those that will hear the very word reparations and start blustering that this is just one more way that blacks are asking for a government handout,'' he said. ''And then you are going have those that say the university is just trying to whitewash things. Our hope is to carve out as large a middle as possible.''
 The issue of reparations has caused friction at Brown before, and at other northern universities built with the investments of slave traders. In March 2001, the student newspaper, The Brown Daily Herald, printed a full-page advertisement listing ''Ten Reasons Why Reparations for Slavery is a Bad Idea And Racist Too.'' The advertisement, produced by David Horowitz, a conservative writer, argued that slavery happened so long ago and was ended by white Christians, and said black Americans should be grateful for their prosperity and freedom in the United States.
 The advertisement, also run by a handful of newspapers at other colleges, caused a particular uproar at Brown. Student protesters dumped the newspapers in the trash, formed human chains and demanded the paper pay ''reparations'' by donating its advertising fee or giving free advertising space to proponents of reparations. The paper defended itself on the grounds of free speech, and in Dr. Simmons's first speech to students after taking office that summer, she stressed her support for the free expression of unpopular opinions.
 And in 2002, when nine lawsuits seeking reparations were filed in New York, New Jersey and other states against FleetBoston, Aetna, J. P. Morgan Chase, and other companies, lawyers involved in the cases said Brown, Yale and Harvard Law School were likely defendants in future suits. So far, rulings have gone against the plaintiffs. 
 Brown started as Rhode Island College. Its founder, the Rev. James Manning, freed his only slave, but accepted donations from slave owners and traders, including the Brown family of Providence.
 Four Brown brothers, John, Joseph, Moses and Nicholas, were active benefactors. John, a treasurer of the college, was a slave trader, while Moses freed his slaves and became a Quaker and an abolitionist. Moses was supported by Nicholas and Nicholas's son, Nicholas Jr., who became the university's namesake. 
 Moses pressed for John to be the first Rhode Islander prosecuted under the federal Slave Trade Act of 1794, which barred American ports from outfitting slave-trade ships. John was fined. 
 Dr. Campbell pointed out that even Moses's role was complicated because he ran a textile factory that used cotton grown with slave labor. In addition, records suggest that a Brown family company was involved in building University Hall, which houses Dr. Simmons's office, and that the labor crew included at least two slaves.
 Dr. Campbell said that the committee included experts on South Africa, the Holocaust and the internment of Japanese Americans by the United States in World War II, and that the panel would look at these and other examples of how societies dealt with historical injustice.
 He said that if the committee did recommend that Brown make reparations, several remedies might be considered, for example, providing scholarships or helping African students attend Brown.
 Two Brown professors not on the panel did not object to studying reparations but expressed caution.
 ''I think it's very important that this does not degenerate into a bunch of people congratulating themselves for thinking slavery is bad,'' said Felicia Nimue Ackerman, a philosophy professor and self-described liberal.
 John E. Savage, a computer science professor who says he is conservative on some issues, said: ''I can't see the university as a private institution making reparations to anyone. You'd have to identify who the victims were and have to assess what Brown's culpability would be with respect to those victims.''
 Professor Savage added that even now ''there are individuals who commit crimes and before they are discovered they give money to universities,'' asking, ''Should there be reparations made by those universities who took those gifts?''
 At least one committee member, James Patterson, an emeritus professor of history, said political realities made him doubt that reparations on a national scale ''has any chance at all.'' Professor Patterson said he had ''seen no evidence'' that Brown should be held accountable, saying that ''Brown, like a great many other people in the late 18th century, was indirectly a beneficiary on a very very small scale of the fact that slavery was a source of wealth in this country.''
 Dr. Simmons said she would not reveal her opinion on reparations so as not to influence the committee.
 ''Here's the one thing I'll say,'' she said. ''If the committee comes back and says, 'Oh it's been lovely and we've learned a lot,' but there's nothing in particular that they think Brown can do or should do, I will be very disappointed.''

PERSON: Ewald William Busse

HEADLINE: Ewald W. Busse, 86, Psychiatrist Who Reshaped Views on Aging

BYLINE: By STUART LAVIETES

 BODY:
Dr. Ewald W. Busse, an early leader in the field of geriatric psychiatry and a founder of the Center for Aging and Human Development at Duke University, died on Sunday at his home in Durham, N.C., said his daughter Barbara Busse. 
He was 86.
 Dr. Busse was chairman of the psychiatry department at the Duke Medical School when he began a novel program in 1954 to study the physiological, psychological and social aspects of aging. Previous studies had focused on elderly people living in institutions; Dr. Busse, however, recruited healthy volunteers older than 60 to participate in a long-term program to see how they aged in familiar surroundings. 
 With a grant from the National Institutes of Health in 1957, Dr. Busse established the Center for Aging and expanded his research. His program, known as the Duke Longitudinal Study, eventually involved 800 older adults who submitted to rigorous medical and psychological examinations over 25 years. His findings increased understanding of the physical, mental, social and economic aspects of aging. 
 Known as Bud, Ewald William Busse was born in St. Louis and graduated from Westminster College in Fulton, Mo., and the Washington University School of Medicine. 
 A former president of the American Psychiatric Association, the American Geriatrics Society and the Gerontological Society of America, he received the highest honor given by the American College of Physicians, the William C. Menninger Award, for his contributions to mental health. He retired from Duke in 1987. 
 He is survived by his wife, Ortrude; three daughters, Ortrude White of Atlanta, Barbara Busse of Durham and Emily Bragg of Darien, Conn.; seven grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. His son, Richard, died in 2000.

HEADLINE: President's Impeachment Stirs Angry Protests in South Korea

BYLINE: By SAMUEL LEN

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Saturday, March 13 

 BODY:
With just a month to go before crucial National Assembly elections, South Korea entered uncharted political waters on Saturday after President Roh Moo Hyun was impeached and stripped of power by the National Assembly, unleashing protests in the capital.
 The country's prime minister, Goh Kun, sought to calm the public after he assumed interim leadership. He said in a statement Friday that he would seek to maintain Mr. Roh's policies on relations with North Korea and the United States, and he emphasized that the government would try to shield the country's economy from the turmoil. 
 ''In order to overcome this difficult time for the country, individual branches of the government must execute state affairs in a steady manner,'' Mr. Goh said.
 The public protest culminated Friday afternoon, when about a thousand supporters of the president, including members of the pro-Roh Nosamo organization, rallied in front of the National Assembly, many wearing their trademark yellow jackets or scarves as hundreds of riot police officers surrounded them. The crowd soon grew as large groups of protesters filed in, bringing the total to more than 10,000 people.
 ''If a million of us gather here, then we will be able to create a human wave that represents the will of the public!'' shouted Lee Sang Ho, who led Nosamo in the 2002 election.
 Leaders of Nosamo said Saturday that they planned to hold a larger candlelight rally in downtown Seoul, and many civic and labor groups said they would also protest.
 The vote on Friday to impeach Mr. Roh on charges of illegal campaigning was the first such action in the country's history. A total of 193 lawmakers in the 273-seat National Assembly voted to impeach.
 Last month, Mr. Roh said he would do everything within the law to encourage votes for the upstart Uri Party in the elections scheduled for April 15. The remark outraged the two main opposition parties, who accused him of breaking laws that ban campaigning more than 17 days before an election. They submitted a motion on Tuesday to impeach. 
 In Washington, the State Department responded cautiously, saying the impeachment was an internal matter. ''We will continue to work together on issues of mutual concern, including things like the six-party talks and the Korean forces that are going to Iraq,'' said the department spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, referring to talks on North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
 Prime Minister Goh, a career government bureaucrat who had also served as prime minister from 1997 to 1998, will serve as interim leader until the constitutional court rules on the impeachment vote. The court has 180 days to reach a decision, but most officials predicted that it would rule before then.
 Political analysts said Mr. Goh's ample experience in government administration and his stable style of leadership were calming factors during a time of turmoil. But they said they were concerned about possibly violent outbursts in public between conservatives and supporters of Mr. Roh, especially during an emotionally charged election season.
 ''I'm worried that the unexpected actions of a few could trigger emotions and possibly lead to an uncontrollable situation,'' said Baek Seung Hyun, a political science professor at Kyung Hee University.
 In a survey by the Yonhap news agency of 1,018 South Koreans on Friday, 7 out of 10 said they felt the vote to impeach was improper.
 In the National Assembly, supporters of Mr. Roh likened the impeachment vote to an act of mutiny. ''What happened today was a coup d'etat carried out without guns and swords,'' said Chung Dong Young, a lawmaker with the Uri Party.

PERSON: Coleridge-Taylor Perkinson

HEADLINE: Coleridge-Taylor Perkinson, Versatile Musician, Dies at 71

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Coleridge-Taylor Perkinson, a composer, conductor and pianist who combined styles from the classics to jazz to create sonatas, concertos and symphonies as well as scores for movies and television, died on Tuesday in Chicago. He was 71.
 The cause was cancer, said Rosita M. Sands, director of the Center for Black Music Research at Columbia College Chicago, where Mr. Perkinson was artistic director of the performance program. 
 His career took him from the concert halls of Europe to the jazz combo of the drummer Max Roach, and he did arranging for Marvin Gaye, Harry Belafonte and Melvin Van Peebles, among many others.
 Mr. Perkinson, known as Perk, was a co-founder and musical director of the Symphony of the New World in New York, and was its acting music director during the 1972-73 season.
 At various times he was composer in residence or music director for the Negro Ensemble Company, the Alvin Ailey Dance Company and the Dance Theater of Harlem and for productions of the American Theater Lab, among others. He was guest conductor with many orchestras.
 Mr. Perkinson called composition ''written improvisation.'' Bernard Holland wrote in a review in The New York Times in 1988 that his ''String Quartet No. 1'' ''identified with some precision the compatibilities of French impressionism and jazz.''
 The International Dictionary of Black Composers says he explored ''the extremities of the sound spectrum,'' using odd metrical signatures and other methods, and notes that he placed ''widely spaced accompaniments against closely woven voices a la Stravinsky.''
 Coleridge-Taylor Perkinson was born on June 14, 1932, in Manhattan, and was named for Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, a black British composer and conductor who gained recognition in the 1890's. After graduating from the High School of Music and Art, where he shared the LaGuardia Prize in Music with the soprano Reri Grist, Mr. Perkinson attended New York University.
 He then transferred to the Manhattan School of Music, where he earned bachelor's and master's degrees, studying with Hugh Ross, a prominent choral director, who introduced him to Stravinsky and other musical luminaries. Mr. Perkinson also sang as a baritone soloist in New York churches.
 He taught at Brooklyn College from 1959 to 1962 and was director of the Brooklyn Community Symphony Orchestra, an affiliate of the school's music department. In the summers he studied orchestral conducting at the Mozarteum in Salzburg. In the mid-1960's he played in the Max Roach Quartet and later worked with Mr. Roach as an arranger and conductor.
 His film scores include ''A Warm December,'' a 1973 movie starring and directed by Sidney Poitier. His classical compositions have been recorded by the Chicago Sinfonietta, the flutist Harold Jones and others.
 In a 1973 review in The Times John Rockwell described Mr. Perkinson at the podium, a ''tall, brooding man, he conducts economically and persuasively.'' 
 Mr. Perkinson is survived by his daughter, Joette Thompson, of Kansas City, Mo.; his sister, Beverly Perkinson Thomas of Houston; and two grandchildren.

Diagnostic Imaging Moves Into Many Doctor's Offices
Doctors are installing imaging equipment, particularly M.R.I. machines, in their offices instead of sending patients to a radiologist or local hospitals.
 This has made diagnostic imaging nearly a $100 billion-a-year business, up about 40 percent since 2000, and one of the fastest-growing components of physician services in the Medicare program. [Page A1.]

Stocks Rally but Decline for Week
Stocks rebounded but ended the week lower in what analysts agree has become a market correction. The Nasdaq composite index jumped 40.84 points, to 1,984.73, but fell 3.1 percent for the week and is down slightly so far this year. The Dow Jones industrials climbed 111.70 points, to 10,240.08, and the Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 13.79 points, to 1,120.57. [B4.]

Consumer confidence fell as Americans grew more pessimistic about the outlook for an economy creating few jobs. [B2.]

China Buying U.S. Industrial Waste
China has a nearly insatiable demand for industrial junk, importing more than $1 billion of American scrap last year. [A1.]

Senate Approves Budget Resolution
The Senate approved a $2.4 trillion budget resolution for next year that could imperil President Bush's drive to make all his tax cuts permanent while it tries to shrink the federal deficit faster than the White House proposes. [A1.]
WorldCom Revises Results
WorldCom reduced its pretax profits for 2000 and 2001 by $74.4 billion and filed 2002 results for the first time. It also said that it expects to emerge from bankruptcy protection in April, and officially change its name to MCI. [B14.]

Delta President Joins Virgin Group
The president of Delta Air Lines, Frederick W. Reid, is joining the Virgin Group to oversee the low-fare carrier Sir Richard Branson hopes to start in the United States next year. [B2.]

Medicare Nominee Is Confirmed
The Senate confirmed Dr. Mark B. McClellan, President Bush's nominee to run Medicare and Medicaid, after the Senate majority leader promised to help develop legislation to allow imports of lower-cost prescription drugs, with safeguards to protect consumers. [A9.]

Former Airline Chief Scrutinized
Swiss prosecutors are investigating Andre Dose, left, who resigned as chief of Swiss International Air Lines this week, and two other airline executives in connection with a plane crash in 2001 that killed 24 people. The accident occurred when an RJ-100 Jumbolino came down near Zurich airport as the pilot struggled to negotiate a difficult landing route. [B4.]

Morgan Stanley Accused of Bias
Morgan Stanley, the target of a government sex-bias suit rooted in a 1998 claim by a fired bond trader, discriminated against women in 2003 and might be sued again, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said. [B2.]

Fitch Lowers Outlook on Shell
Fitch Ratings lowered its outlook for the credit rating of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group, the latest fallout from its decision to cut the estimates of its oil and gas reserves. [B14.]

Black to Appeal Court Decision
Conrad M. Black will appeal a court ruling that blocked his sale of Hollinger Inc., the Canadian company he uses to control the newspaper publisher Hollinger International. [B14.]

Lockheed Deal Deadline Extended
Lockheed Martin and the Titan Corporation extended the deadline for their proposed merger because of two federal inquiries that threaten to scuttle the $2.4 billion deal. [B4.]

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 12 

 BODY:
The Senate voted early Friday morning to approve a $2.4 trillion budget resolution for next year that could imperil President Bush's drive to make all his tax cuts permanent while it tries to shrink the federal deficit faster than the White House proposes.
 The vote came hours after budget deliberations broke down in the House following a rebellion by Republicans who demanded that party leaders take tougher actions to control spending. Taken together, the moves reflected apprehension among some Republicans that the deficit is gaining new currency as an election-year issue.
 ''The budget issue is a very critical issue, and frankly, a defining issue for many members of Congress,'' Representative Jeb Hensarling, a freshman Texas Republican who has emerged as a leader in efforts by conservatives to rein in what they consider unsustainable spending growth, said in an interview this week. He added: ''I didn't come to Congress to grow government.'' 
 The Senate passed the budget in the early morning hours on Friday on a mostly party-line vote of 51 to 45. But the Senate action, and the difficulty the budget is encountering in the House, betray concerns among some Republicans over the course of President Bush's fiscal policy. White House officials, in contrast, took issue with the notion that the administration is responsible for the deficit. 
 Over all, the Senate budget is similar to the White House proposal but calls for slower growth in spending and, after five years, a deficit $56 billion lower than the administration plan. Also, White House officials acknowledge that an amendment approved over objections by Senate Republican leaders will complicate efforts to extend Mr. Bush's tax cuts -- though House Republican leaders already have signaled that they intend to kill the provision.
 The Senate resolution calls for the deficit to fall to $202 billion in 2009 from an estimated $478 billion this year, though Democrats say they believe the proposal would not cut the deficit by nearly that much.
 For most Republicans, especially those in the House, the problem they see is with spending. This week, conservative and moderate Republicans forced a delay on a committee vote on the House's proposed budget, demanding that lawmakers first draft new budget rules that would force future spending growth to be paid for with cuts in other spending.
 Representative Patrick J. Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican on the budget committee, said that many Republicans were concerned that without new budget rules not enough would be done to control spending in future years.
 ''We wanted to have strong enforcement,'' Mr. Toomey said.
 Representative Sue Myrick, a North Carolina Republican who is chairwoman of the Republican Study Committee, a group of almost 100 conservative House members, said President Bush's budget was a ''good start.'' But Ms. Myrick adds: ''We are in this tight budget year and concerned about what's happening with the budget. We just want to do better than he has done in holding the line on spending.''
 ''What people at home are concerned about is spending so much money,'' she said. 
 At the White House, officials say they are growing tired of being blamed for failing to curb spending and of assertions that Congressional proposals will cut the deficit more deeply and quickly. With the exception of military spending, they say, Congress has sought more money than the administration for legislation including airline bailouts, the farm bill, retirement benefits for people who served in the military, the highway bill and the energy bill.
 ''President Bush has been the lever of spending restraint in Washington for his entire first term,'' said Trent Duffy, a White House spokesman. ''We welcome the Congress's interest in holding the line on spending.''
 On Friday, the Republican Main Street Partnership, a group made up primarily of 55 moderate House Republicans, endorsed the budget committee's intention to adopt ''pay as you go'' rules for spending. The group members said it was not their style ''to take a 'my way or the highway' stance on any piece of legislation, but we are deficit hawks who believe Congress must take bold action now to address the deficit.''
 House Republican leaders were taken by surprise by the revolt this week. One leadership aide said that leaders felt ''bamboozled'' at being caught off guard and forced to delay the committee vote -- and, as a result, action on the House floor.
 But Democrats wasted no time capitalizing on the dispute. Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 House Democrat, said ''their stubborn refusal to pay for tax cuts makes any real deficit reduction a virtual impossibility.''
 Many Democrats say the principal budget problem is the effect the Bush tax cuts have already had. They point to White House projections that taxes and other government receipts, as a percentage of the gross domestic product, are expected to fall to 15.7 percent this year. That would be the lowest percentage since 1950, and a huge drop from four years ago, when receipts totaled 20.9 percent of gross domestic product. In terms of actual government receipts, the federal government is expected to bring in $1.8 trillion in 2004 as compared with $2.03 trillion in 2000.
 Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee, estimates that almost half of the decline in tax revenue as a percentage of gross domestic product has been caused by the tax cuts, and the other half by the state of the economy.
 Mr. Bush and other Republicans say the tax cuts were needed -- and still are necessary -- to spur the economy. But some Republicans in Congress say they fear that the economic growth from the tax cuts will be frittered away over time by the effects of the deficit, unless it is more aggressively reckoned with.
 ''If we continue to carry a half-trillion-dollar deficit, you're going to wash away the effects of tax relief,'' said Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican. 
 That sentiment was reflected on Wednesday, when the Senate voted 51 to 48 to adopt new rules as part of its budget resolution to force tax-cut proposals over the next five years to win at least 60 votes, unless spending cuts or increases in other taxes can be found to pay for them. Four Republicans joined all but one Democrat to support the measure. ''Given our current budget position, we ought to make it harder to make the deficit worse,'' said Senator Russell D. Feingold, the Wisconsin Democrat who sponsored the amendment.
 The vote came despite strong objections by the White House. Mr. Duffy said that Mr. Bush opposed the Feingold approach because ''raising taxes right now is the wrong way to go.''
 House Republican leaders quickly signaled that they were likely to kill the provision when House and Senate budget writers met to reconcile differences in the budgets that pass the House and Senate.
 Mr. Feingold's provision will not pose a problem for the extension of three popular tax breaks that expire this year and have bipartisan support for renewal: ending the so-called ''marriage penalty'' under which some couples pay more taxes when they marry and file jointly; expanding the 10 percent tax bracket, and keeping the child tax credit at $1,000 per year.
 Republican leaders avoided having to take a stand on those Bush tax cuts that expire at the end of the decade by putting forward five-year, instead of 10-year, budgets. But the White House did get the Senate to budget for a $27 billion, or 7 percent, increase in military spending. Financing in the Senate resolution for domestic security also rises by $4 billion, or 15 percent, while other discretionary spending would rise by $2 billion, or 0.4 percent -- both in line with White House proposals.

HEADLINE: The Pundit on the Desktop

BYLINE: By Mike Morton and Sabra Morton. 
Mike Morton is a software engineer. Sabra Morton is a writer.

 BODY:
Ars Magna, the software program that always answers in anagrams, has been giving some thought to the presidential election. When we say senator, for instance, it replies treason; and if we ask it about tax policies, it comes back with axe politics. Recently, we settled in for an interview about the 2004 presidential race:
 So, Ars, the next big political event will be the Democratic convention. What do you think the party really wants?
 To intervene; chad not comic.
 How will the convention respond to the Massachusetts senator?
 Chorus: Statesman! Asset!
 Do you personally have an opinion about Senator John Kerry?
 John? Ornery streak.
 The Republicans are attacking Senator Kerry now for changing his mind about important issues. He criticizes the administration's Iraq policy, yet just a year ago he voted to go to war in the Gulf again.
 Gather in awful gain.
 As you may know, Senator Kerry has been called a Boston brahmin.
 O, man! Birth snob!
 What can his so-called Band of Brothers -- Vietnam veterans -- offer him?
 Net verve, stamina.
 Let's turn to the Republican National Convention. What might be its message to the country?
 Continual privation can ennoble.
 And what will President George W. Bush say to his party?
 Whee! Progress in budget!
 Do you agree?
 Progress? Huge new debit!
 The president once billed himself as a compassionate conservative. How do you interpret that now?
 Conspire to save a vast income.
 Mr. Bush assures us the economy will turn around soon, and Fed Chairman Greenspan --
 Spending framer an ache!
 It seems you don't like the chairman's proposal for Social Security and Medicare cuts.
 Edit care? Scum!
 Later in the year, we'll have the Bush-Kerry debates. What should we expect?
 Test, hey? Bash, drub. Reek.
 Do you think Ralph Nader should be allowed to take part in the presidential debates?
 Despise alternate bid!
 It appears the Republicans' big issue will be national security. What do you think of the Patriot Act?
 A pathetic tort.
 As for the Democrats, they'll keep raising the Florida debacle of 2000. We've read that some states will use the touchscreen voting machine. Do you worry that it might skew the outcome?
 Oh, much concern! Investigate!

HEADLINE: Creating the Next Crime Wave

 BODY:
President Bush surprised some people when he spoke sympathetically about ex-convicts during his State of the Union address and announced a proposal to furnish mentoring, job placement and transitional housing for ex-offenders. The $300 million budget is far too small, but it was heartening to hear Mr. Bush acknowledge that there was more to crime prevention than just locking up people -- and that pushing ex-cons into a hostile world without help is a recipe for civic disaster. 
 The United States has the largest, most expensive and fastest-growing prison system in the world, and it may be unsustainable over the long run. Faced with a national price tag for corrections that exceeds $50 billion per year, states are being forced to re-evaluate the stiff sentencing policies that drove up the prison population to more than 2 million, from 200,000 three decades ago. In recent years, 25 states have eased sentencing policies and reinstated early release and treatment programs for drug offenders, now about a quarter of the nation's prisoners.
 These sentencing changes would have been politically impossible 20 years ago, when the country was racked by a crack-inspired crime wave. The states responded with stiff sentences for certain crimes. Then, over the last decade, national crime rates fell sharply. Prosecutors and the police rushed to take credit, arguing that crime had gone down because criminals had been locked up.
 The problem with this explanation is that crime went down just as much in states that did not adopt tough new policing and sentencing strategies as in states that embraced them. The emerging consensus is that mass incarceration accounts for only a fraction of the drop in violent crime. The strong economy of the 1990's clearly played a role, as did demographic factors -- and the ending of the crack epidemic, aided by teenagers who shunned the drug after seeing parents and older siblings destroyed.
 If society hopes to maintain that welcome drop in crime, whatever its causes, it must now confront the fact that mass imprisonment creates a huge population of ex-convicts. About 600,000 hit the streets each year with no skills, no place to live and few family connections. These former offenders are almost always ruled out of consideration for decent jobs and are further marginalized by laws that bar them from getting student loans or driver's licenses, from voting and from becoming tenants in public housing developments. Many revert to lawlessness and end up back in prison within a few brief years.
 Mr. Bush was on point when he said that ''America is the land of [the] second chance, and when the gates of the prison open, the path ahead should lead to a better life.'' But more money is needed to make his initiative more than a gesture. In addition, the country will need to change its attitude before it can reincorporate the millions of ex-offenders who stand at the margins of society with no clear way into the mainstream.

HEADLINE: Jobs Czar Left Jobless

 BODY:
Every now and then, a hollow gesture actually does come back to haunt a politician. For President Bush, his ballyhooed announcement last Labor Day to appoint a ''jobs czar'' in the Commerce Department has boomeranged badly. 
The expected appointment of Anthony Raimondo, a Nebraska businessman, as the new assistant secretary for manufacturing suddenly fell through as Democrats circulated word that Mr. Raimondo had laid off 75 of his workers two years ago and planned to open a $3 million factory in China.
 Mr. Raimondo and his supporters argue that he still employs several hundred American workers, and that his prefabricated-building plant in China is serving that market. But this is an election year, with protectionist passions running high and millions of potential voters out of work. The White House quickly jettisoned Mr. Raimondo.
 What the episode underscored was that the unemployment challenge deserves more considered remedies than the appointment of a man who could never pass political muster to a job that never seemed serious. From the first, the new post seemed a ploy to paper over the fact that Mr. Bush's deficit-feeding tax cuts for the wealthy have failed to create the millions of new jobs he promised. 
 The scarcity of new jobs in a growing economy is a complex problem. President Bush and John Kerry should engage in a fittingly serious debate about the issue.

HEADLINE: China's Need for Metal Keeps U.S. Scrap Dealers Scrounging

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK and KEITH BRADSHER; Andrew Pollack reported from Los Angeles for this article and Keith Bradsher from Hong Kong.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 12 

 BODY:
At a time when toys, televisions and other products made in China are flooding into the United States, helping push the trade deficit to record levels, there is at least one American product for which China has a nearly insatiable demand -- industrial junk. 
 Sales of scrap metal to China have surged, with effects that are ricocheting across the American economy. Prices are soaring not just for scrap, but for metals in general. After years of surpluses that forced many steel makers into bankruptcy, supplies are so tight that contractors told a Congressional hearing in Washington this week that they sometimes cannot obtain supplies at any price. 
 China last year became the first country ever to import more than $1 billion of American scrap, according to the newspaper American Metal Market. Indeed, it would not be an exaggeration to say that China's transformation into an industrial powerhouse is being fueled by America's waste, and that of other countries, as well. Much of the material being used to build China's skyscrapers, factories and telecommunications systems -- along with many of the products it exports -- is derived from scrap, which is usually cheaper than new metal made from ore. 
 ''China is very hungry,'' said David Pan, a Chinese-born scrap metal buyer, as a truck carrying steel reinforcing bars from a dismantled building in San Diego prepared to dump its cargo with a deafening clatter on the floor of his warehouse in Maywood, an industrial town just south of here. ''They need a lot of material.''
 A decade ago, Mr. Pan was working in a Los Angeles restaurant when relatives back in China asked him to start buying scrap. Now, as China booms, so does Mr. Pan's business, called Universal Scrap Metals. He ships about 500 containers a month to China filled with battered pipes, fine metal shavings, doorknobs, jumbles of wire, crumpled cars and all other manner of flotsam. He is even negotiating to buy the remains of a steel factory in Utah; he would ship it, as scrap, to his native country. 
 American scrap dealers, an industry of 1,200 or so mainly mom-and-pop operations, are sharing in the boom times. 
 ''They're scrounging every yard in the country, like a vacuum cleaner,'' Ely Keenberg, president of Ekco Metals, a Los Angeles scrap dealer, said of purchasers from China. At one point during an interview, Mr. Keenberg's receptionist interrupted to show him the business card of a man from Hong Kong who had just made a cold call looking for scrap. ''If we allowed it, we'd have one in here every five minutes,'' said Mr. Keenberg, who sells 90 percent of his scrap to Chinese buyers.
 American companies that depend on scrap are, in the meantime, scrounging. 
 ''We're having greater and greater difficulty in securing scrap,'' said M. Brian O'Shaughnessy, chief executive and principal owner of Revere Copper Products in Rome, N.Y., a company founded by Paul Revere that turns copper scrap into sheets and strips. ''It's causing the price of scrap to go through the ceiling.''
 Both copper and steel industry trade groups are drawing up petitions that would ask the government to temporarily limit scrap exports -- an authority that Washington has used only once, in the mid-1970s.
 The price of scrap steel has soared to more than $300 a ton, compared with about $156 a ton at the end of 2003 and $77 at the beginning of 2001, according to the Emergency Steel Scrap Coalition, a group backed by steel users and minimills, which use scrap to make about half of the nation's steel. Many minimills have imposed surcharges to pass the higher costs onto customers like automobile and construction companies, with some of them resisting. 
 ''Scrap is the overwhelming factor determining steel prices at this point,'' said Christopher Plummer, managing director of Metal Strategies, a consulting firm in West Chester, Pa. 
 Rising exports are clearly one factor behind the high prices, but the extent to which they can be blamed is debated. Over all, exports of steel scrap have almost doubled since 2000 to 11.9 million tons last year, close to a record. China was the largest importer, accounting for 3.5 million tons, or about 30 percent, of the exports.
 But scrap dealers argue that exports are still small compared with domestic consumption of about 70 million tons a year, and so could not account for the huge price increases. Moreover, they note, there have been several occasions in the last two decades when total scrap exports reached or even exceeded last year's levels. 
 ''What is happening now is not unique,'' said Robin Wiener, president of the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, the dealers' trade group. Attempts to restrict scrap exports, she said, are ''just clearly a smoke screen attempt to control the price of scrap'' and would be a ''distortion of free trade.'' 
 Some experts add that in any event, China's building boom has the look of a bubble and cannot last indefinitely. Indeed, China's State Development and Reform Commission just announced that after fixed investment in steel mills rose 90 percent last year, it would stop approving virtually all applications to build mills. Still, with many mills approaching completion, one Chinese trade group forecasts that imports of scrap will nearly double by 2005 over last year's levels. 
 David L. Edelstein, copper commodities specialist at the United States Geological Survey, noted that while copper prices -- about $1.30 a pound -- are high, they have been as high before. One reason for price increases, he said, was that some copper producers were holding back output, after an oversupply a couple of years ago.
 But copper scrap exports to China, including Hong Kong, have quintupled since 1998, and China now accounts for 70 percent of the total. China's purchases of American copper scrap last year were equal to about 40 percent of American consumption. 
 Scrap dealers argue that in some cases, the scrap going to China would be of no use to Americans because it would cost too much to sort into its various parts. But with China's cheap labor, that effort is affordable. 
 ''We send everything to China,'' said Danny C. Yiu, vice president of Ekco Metals, the company owned by Mr. Keenberg. ''They will use chisels, hammers, hand tools to break this apart and sort it out.''
 He pointed around Ekco's yards at various heaps of old automobile radiators, pots and pans, air-conditioner condensers, even parts of jet engines. There were also old soda cans squashed into giant cubes weighing 1,000 pounds each, stacked six or seven high. 
 At a loading dock, small Bobcat construction vehicles were loading two of the 25 or so 20-ton shipping containers that leave here each day for the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. After a Bobcat shoved a load deep into the container, the driver backed up, then accelerated forward, crashing into the pile with a loud bang to compress it. 
 The scrap world has its own vernacular to facilitate trading. Copper wire is known as ''barley,'' yellow brass is ''honey'' and No.1 copper tubing is ''candy.'' And there is a food chain, where one company's scrap turns into another company's raw material. 
 The people above Ekco Metals in the food chain say they are not getting enough to eat. A few miles from Ekco is California Metal-X, which buys copper scrap and melts it in huge furnaces to make bronze and brass ingots. It then sells those ingots to foundries that make everything from bronze statues to brass valves. 
 ''Last year was a year from hell,'' said Tim Strelitz, who founded and runs the company with his wife, Karen. The company last year cut its work force from 70 to 38 people, the first layoffs since its founding in 1979. 
 One problem, Mr. Strelitz said, was that it was difficult to compete with Chinese buyers, who have grown in sophistication since the days when Mr. Pan and others first came shopping. ''They are not owners of restaurants trying to buy for a cousin anymore,'' he said. ''They are buying for a dollar what I can only offer 80 cents for.'' 
 Yet another reason for Mr. Strelitz's problems is that his customers are ailing -- and in some cases going out of business -- in part because they face stiff competition from Chinese manufacturers of valves, faucets and other brass products. 
 ''I've lost millions of dollars per year to China already,'' said Leigh Omer, foundry manager at Fresno Valves and Castings in Selma, Calif., a customer of Mr. Strelitz. 
 To Mr. Strelitz, Mr. Omer and others dependent on copper scrap, this seems like the ultimate indignity -- that Chinese companies drive up scrap prices, yet are able to sell products made from that scrap for less than American manufacturers can. Indeed, American copper companies contend that China is subsidizing importers of copper scrap and exporters of finished products, in part through tax rebates. 
 Joe Mayer, president and general counsel of the Copper and Brass Fabricators Council, said the group might file a trade complaint about this. ''The faucets from China are coming into the United States at less than the metal value that we would have to pay,'' Mr. Mayer said.
 Meng Jianbin, director of international cooperation at the Metallurgical Council of China for the Promotion of International Trade, a Chinese trade group, denied that his government subsidizes the scrap industry. While some incentives are provided for scrapyards to set up operations in particular industrial zones, they are not especially generous, he said.
 Mr. Pan, the Chinese scrap merchant, said that Americans should be a little more appreciative of the benefits of China's scrap purchases. After all, he argued, they keep some junk that could never be used in the United States from ending up in American landfills. 
 ''We do something good for America,'' he said. ''We do something good for China.''

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Declines

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Consumer confidence fell in March as Americans grew more pessimistic about the outlook for an economy that is creating the fewest jobs at this stage of expansion than in any recovery since World War II. 
 The University of Michigan's preliminary index of consumer sentiment declined to 94.1 from 94.4 in February, when confidence fell by the most since the terrorist attacks in September 2001. The survey's gauge of optimism over the next five months dropped for a second month, and an index of current conditions rose. 
 ''Although jobs gains continue, they are rather modest and that's what is affecting people's overall sentiment,'' said Kevin Logan, a senior market economist at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein in New York, and the top forecaster of consumer spending in a Bloomberg Markets magazine survey last year. 
 Employers added 21,000 workers in February, a sixth of the median forecast in a Bloomberg News economist survey. The weak job market, an issue in this year's presidential campaign, has not hurt spending yet. Businesses said sales rose 0.4 percent in January, keeping stockpiles lean, the Commerce Department reported in Washington. Inventories rose 0.1 percent, less than expected. 
 Overall retail sales rose 0.6 percent in February, the Commerce Department said yesterday, and retailers including Wal-Mart Stores said their sales exceeded forecasts. 
 The Commerce Department also reported that the current account deficit narrowed in the fourth quarter, to $127.5 billion, as income rose from American investments abroad. The 3 percent decline in the dollar against a basket of six currencies during the quarter may have contributed, when overseas profits were translated from local currencies, economists said. 
 The United States has lost 2.3 million jobs in three years, including 1.05 million since the latest expansion began in November 2001. Based on nine economic recoveries since World War II, monthly nonfarm payroll growth in the 28th month of an expansion has averaged more than 250,000 jobs, according to Merrill Lynch. 
 The Federal Reserve is expected to keep its benchmark interest rate at 1 percent next week, the lowest since 1958, in an effort to help lift employment. The economy grew at an average annual pace of 6.1 percent in the second half of 2003. 
 The preliminary Michigan index is based on a survey of about 250 households, half the sample size for the final reading on March 26. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News projected a reading of 94.5, based on the median of 53 estimates. Estimates ranged from 90 to 98. 
 The survey's expectations index, which measures optimism about the next one to five months, fell to 86.6 from 88.5 a month earlier. The current conditions index, based on perceptions of consumers' financial situation and whether it is a good time to make major purchases, rose to 105.7 from 103.6 in February.

HEADLINE: Shares Rally From 4 Days of Losses, but End Week Down

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks rebounded yesterday after four days of heavy losses, but still ended the week substantially lower in what analysts agree has become a full-fledged market correction.
 The question on the minds of investors was whether the rebound yesterday, after a four-day loss of 467.17 points in the Dow Jones industrial average, was an isolated blip or was an end to the sell-off.
 ''We've had the 5 percent correction that everybody's been waiting for, and the market's way oversold now,'' said Michael Murphy, lead trader at Wachovia Securities. ''But is what we're seeing going to be a big bounce or a small bounce? That'll be the big test.'' 
 The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 111.70 points, or 1.1 percent, to 10,240.08. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 13.79 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,120.57, and the Nasdaq composite index jumped 40.84 points, or 2.1 percent, to 1,984.73.
 The gains yesterday did little to offset the losses of the previous four days. For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 355.47 points, or 3.4 percent; the Nasdaq fell 62.9 points, or 3.1 percent; and the S.&P. 500 lost 36.29 points, or 3.1 percent. 
 Joseph Battipaglia, chief investment officer at Ryan Beck & Company, attributed the gains to the strong economic foundation that remained from the market's nearly 12-month rally, which kept money from fleeing out of stocks and into bonds or commodities.
 ''This is very typical of a healthy market,'' Mr. Battipaglia said. ''The market needed to correct itself to bring stock prices back in line, and now it looks to me that investors are looking at this as a chance to buy.''
 Buyers were aided by the widely watched University of Michigan consumer sentiment index, which slipped to a better-than-expected 94.1 in March from 94.4 at the end of February. The preliminary tally will be revised at the end of the month.
 The government provided yet another set of contradictory economic reports before yesterday's session. Business inventories rose 0.1 percent in January, and business sales climbed 0.4 percent. But the Commerce Department also reported that the deficit in the current account -- the broadest measure of the nation's trade -- rose 12.7 percent in 2003, to a record $541.8 billion.
 Oracle was down 19 cents, to $12.06, after it reported that net income rose 11 percent, to $635 million, or 12 cents a share, continuing its financial recovery and meeting Wall Street estimates.
 Borders Group reported improved sales at its stores and beat analysts' expectations by 9 cents a share. The shares gained 94 cents, to $24.11.
 Petco Animal Supplies, the pet store chain, slumped 80 cents, to $30.30, despite a 7.8 percent increase in quarterly profits, beating estimates by 3 cents a share.
 Lockheed Martin said it would delay a final shareholder vote on its proposed merger with the technology company Titan while the government investigates questionable payments from Titan to foreign consultants. Lockheed fell 15 cents, to $44.48, while Titan rose 76 cents, to $20.20.
 Treasury prices declined yesterday. The 10-year Treasury note fell 25/32, to a price of 101 24/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 3.78 percent from 3.69 percent on Thursday.
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond dropped 27/32, to 109 29/32. The bond's yield jumped to 4.72 percent from 4.65 percent on Thursday.

HEADLINE: New Darlings for Some Inflation-Wary Investors

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
An investment that Wall Street was trying to kill off just three years ago is coming on strong.
 Treasury Inflation Protected Securities are being snapped up by individual investors as well as pension funds and others who are concerned that inflation could erode their returns in coming years.
 Though inflation is near historic lows, the fear is that consumer prices may be poised to rise in the months and years ahead if the economy continues to rebound. If goods and services become more expensive, the low fixed returns offered on standard bonds will have even less buying power.
 The securities, issued by the federal government, pay the investor a set interest rate, and their principal gains in value along with the rise in the Consumer Price Index. Since the Treasury began selling this type of security to a lackluster reception seven years ago, the market has swelled. Now, what is widely called the TIPS market has nearly $200 billion in circulation. And in an unusual market twist, the securities seem to be more profitable for investors than for Wall Street, which was lobbying for their demise not so long ago. 
 ''What Wall Street doesn't like about them -- the 'buy and hold' mentality -- is what makes TIPS good for investors,'' said Dan Bernstein, director of Research at Bridgewater Associates, which manages more than $3.5 billion in the inflation-indexed securities.
 While the market for these securities is tiny compared with the regular Treasury market, which totals $3.6 trillion, it is about to grow at a faster clip. Along with the 10-year version, the government is expected to issue one or two new terms in May. A 5-year and a 20-year are considered likely possibilities. With this addition, annual sales could rise, to perhaps $60 billion, from about $30 billion last year. 
 More important, demand among investors is growing quickly. If institutions like pension funds become convinced that the market is large enough to accommodate their needs, the demand could surge.
 The shift from government surplus to budget deficits has also changed the landscape. Wall Street found the inflation-protected securities to be more of a nuisance than a profit-making tool in part because the market was too small. 
 TIPS were ''on their deathbed in the summer of 2001,'' said Tim Bitsberger, deputy assistant Treasury secretary for federal finance. ''We decided we would remain committed to TIPS, but few believed us.''
 ''In the past six months,'' Mr. Bitsberger said, ''many firms have been reallocating resources to TIPS.'' 
 Tom Kalaris, the chief executive at Barclays Capital, Americas, was an early proponent of the inflation-protected securities. ''The product,'' he said, ''has arrived.'' 
 Investors from big to small are jumping on the bandwagon. The pension funds of New York State and New York City, among the largest retirement funds in the country, with almost $200 billion in assets, have decided to allocate 3 percent to 7 percent of their portfolios to the inflation-protected securities. Some other pension funds are doing the same, as are big endowments. Harvard has put 6 percent in its Policy Portfolio, which is a guideline for asset allocation. 
 At the same time, more individual investors are buying the securities. For the eight months through February, $3.9 billion has flowed into mutual funds that buy mostly inflation-protected securities, according to AMG Data Services. That was 30 percent of the total inflow into taxable bond funds. 
 Just as people think of such investments as natural for their retirement funds, pension funds see them as a way to meet their obligations, because many pension payments are tied to inflation.
 Adam M. Blumenthal, the first deputy comptroller for New York City, said the securities provide diversification because they tend to move in the opposite direction from stocks and bonds over time. They are also less volatile than stocks and normal bonds. ''Although the market is still small,'' he said, ''we believe it is large enough to absorb the allocation'' of the city's pension funds. 
 Paul Mussche, the head of government strategy at Deutsche Bank Securities, said ''the move by New York State and New York City is a trend that bodes well for TIPS.''
 Investors need to be cautious, though, because of the recent run-up. The inflation-protected securities had a total return of 7.3 percent for the 12 months ended in February, compared with 2.9 percent for regular Treasuries. After being undervalued for a while, the securities are at best fairly valued now, say many analysts, suggesting investors need a long-term view to make them worthwhile. ''People will be happier 20 years from now having held TIPS rather than regular Treasury bonds,'' said Chip Plumb of Evanston, Ill., a consultant who appraises the value of businesses. His domestic fixed-income portfolio, which is about 20 percent of his total investments, is in the securities.
 But for Wall Street, the securities have not been that popular. Only a handful of Wall Street firms have a significant, full-service commitment to the market. One reason is that investors like to buy and hold the securities, meaning they do not trade a lot, and Wall Street makes money on trading. In addition, the lower volatility crimps Wall Street profits.
 But this may be changing as interest grows worldwide in this type of securities. Though not one of the early participants in the market, the United States is now the biggest issuer. The global market, led by Britain, is also growing. Italy issued its second inflation-linked bond in February, and Japan sold its first issues of inflation-linked bonds last week. Germany is considering it, and France has been a long-time issuer. 
 The market for other types of securities linked to inflation is also swelling. There are now swaps, in which investors trade long-term and short-term interest payments, linked to inflation. There is a futures contract based on the Consumer Price Index now trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Fannie Mae, the government-sponsored mortgage agency, issued an inflation-linked bond last month, its first since 1997. 
 ''We see that the breadth of users are increasing,'' said Sanjay Verma, head of United States government trading at Morgan Stanley. ''It has become a necessary product if we are going to be a full-service bank.''
 To that end, Morgan Stanley hired a TIPS research specialist away from Barclays last year and now has full-time traders devoted to the Treasury securities and inflation derivatives. 
 Michelle Cunningham, director of internal fixed income at the California State Teachers Retirement System, said that right now the TIPS market ''is a bit small for us,'' making it difficult to own enough of the securities to make an impact in a fund its size. The California Public Employees Retirement System, which is the largest in the nation, is not making a fixed allocation to the securities either.
 Still, both funds have bought some of the securities when their analysts thought they were a bargain, and Ms. Cunningham said she was interested in them as a long-term investment. ''For a pension fund with liabilities affected by inflation, TIPS would be a good hedge,'' she said. For this kind of buying, though, she said the market should be around $500 billion in outstanding securities.
 The critical mass could be achieved, though, given the Treasury's additional commitment and the enormous amount of borrowing the government will have to do over the next several years to cover projected budget deficits.

HEADLINE: U.S. Wins Ruling In Mexico Case

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 12 

 BODY:
The United States said on Friday that it had won a victory at the World Trade Organization that could save consumers and companies billions of dollars on phone calls to Mexico. 
 Mexico now requires United States telecommunications carriers to connect with Mexican carriers to complete calls from the United States. 
The government also grants Mexico's dominant carrier, Telefonos de Mexico, known as Telmex, the exclusive authority to negotiate the rate for connecting calls into Mexico.
 The United States trade representative, Robert B. Zoellick, said in a statement that the W.T.O. agreed that Mexico's regulations violated international trade rules. Telmex may now be forced to charge lower rates for using its network, or Mexico could risk trade sanctions.
 Both the United States and Mexico have the right to appeal the W.T.O. ruling. If neither country exercises that option, the ruling will be adopted by the W.T.O., with the recommendation that Mexico comply with the decision.

HEADLINE: All This Progress Is Killing Us, Bite by Bite

BYLINE: By GREGG EASTERBROOK. 
Gregg Easterbrook, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution, is the author of ''The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse'' (Random House).

 BODY:
YOUR great-great grandparents would find it hard to believe the Boeing 747, but perhaps they'd have a harder time believing last week's news that obesity has become the second-leading cause of death in the United States. Too much food a menace instead of too little! A study released by the federal Centers for Disease Control ranked ''poor diet and physical inactivity'' as the cause of 400,000 United States deaths in 2000, trailing only fatalities from tobacco. Obesity, the C.D.C. said, now kills five times as many Americans as ''microbial agents,'' that is, infectious disease.
 Moon landings might seem less shocking to your great-great grandparents than abundance of food causing five times as many deaths as germs; OutKast might seem less bizarre to them than the House passing legislation last week to exempt restaurants from being sued for serving portions that are too large. 
 Your recent ancestors would further be stunned by the notion of plump poverty. A century ago, the poor were as lean as fence posts; worry about where to get the next meal was a constant companion for millions. Today, America's least well-off are so surrounded by double cheeseburgers, chicken buckets, extra-large pizzas and supersized fries that they are more likely to be overweight than the population as a whole. 
 But the expanding waistline is not only a problem of lower-income Americans who dine too often on fast food. Today, the typical American is overweight, according to the C.D.C., which estimates that 64 percent of American citizens are carrying too many pounds for their height. Obesity and sedentary living are rising so fast that their health consequences may soon supplant tobacco as the No. 1 preventable cause of death, the C.D.C. predicts. Rates of heart disease, stroke and many cancers are in decline, while life expectancy is increasing -- but ever-rising readings on the bathroom scale may be canceling out what would otherwise be dramatic gains in public health.
 O.K., it's hard to be opposed to food. But the epidemic of obesity epitomizes the unsettled character of progress in affluent Western society. Our lives are characterized by too much of a good thing -- too much to eat, to buy, to watch and to do, excess at every turn. Sometimes achievement itself engenders the excess: today's agriculture creates so much food at such low cost that who can resist that extra helping? 
 Consider other examples in which society's success seems to be backfiring on our health or well-being.

PRODUCTIVITY. Higher productivity is essential to rising living standards and to the declining prices of goods and services. But higher productivity may lead to fewer jobs.
 Early in the postwar era, analysts fretted that automation would take over manufacturing, throwing everyone out of work. That fear went unrealized for a generation, in part because robots and computers weren't good at much. Today, near-automated manufacturing is becoming a reality. Newly built factories often require only a fraction of the work force of the plants they replace. Office technology, meanwhile, now allows a few to do what once required a whole hive of worker bees. 
 There may come a point when the gains from higher productivity pale before the job losses. But even if that point does not come, rapid technological change is instilling anxiety about future employment: anxiety that makes it hard to appreciate and enjoy what productivity creates.

TRAFFIC. Cars are much better than they were a few decades ago -- more comfortable, powerful and reliable. They are equipped with safety features like air bags and stuffed with CD players, satellite radios and talking navigation gizmos. Adjusted for consumers' rising buying power, the typical powerful new car costs less than one a generation ago.
 But in part because cars are so desirable and affordable, roads are increasingly clogged with traffic. Today in the United States, there are 230 million cars and trucks in operation, and only 193 million licensed drivers -- more vehicles than drivers! Studies by the Federal Highway Administration show that in the 30 largest cities, total time lost to traffic jams has almost quintupled since 1980. 
 Worse, prosperity has made possible the popularity of S.U.V.'s and the misnamed ''light'' pickup trucks, which now account for half of all new-car sales. Exempt from the fuel-economy standards that apply to regular cars, sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks sustain American dependence on Persian Gulf oil. A new study in the Journal of Risk and Uncertainty showed that the rise in S.U.V.'s and pickup trucks ''leads to substantially more fatalities'' on the road. 
 So just as longevity might be improving at a faster clip were it not for expanding waistlines, death rates in traffic accidents might show a more positive trend were it not for the S.U.V. explosion. 
 The proliferation of cars also encourages us to drive rather than walk. A century ago, the typical American walked three miles a day; now the average is less than a quarter mile a day. Some research suggests that the sedentary lifestyle, rather than weight itself, is the real threat; a chubby person who is physically active will be O.K. Studies also show that it is not necessary to do aerobics to get the benefits of exercise; a half-hour a day of brisk walking is sufficient. But more cars, driven more miles, mean less walking.

STRESS. It's not just in your mind: Researchers believe stress levels really are rising. People who are overweight or inactive experience more stress than others, and that now applies to the majority. Insufficient sleep increases stress, and Americans now sleep on average only seven hours a night, versus eight hours for our parents' generation and 10 hours for our great-grandparents'.
 Research by Bruce McEwen, a neuroendocrinologist at Rockefeller University in New York, suggests that modern stress, in addition to making life unpleasant, can impair immune function -- again, canceling out health gains that might otherwise occur.
 Prosperity brings many other mixed blessings. Living standards keep rising, but so does incidence of clinical depression. Cellphones are convenient, but make it impossible to escape from office calls. E-mail is cheap and fast, if you don't mind deleting hundreds of spam messages. The Internet and cable television improve communication, but deluge us with the junkiest aspects of culture.
 Americans live in ever-nicer, ever-larger houses, but new homes and the businesses that serve them have to go somewhere. Sprawl continues at a maddening pace, while once-rustic areas may now be gridlocked with S.U.V.'s and power boats. 
 Agricultural yields continue rising, yet that means fewer family farms are needed. Biotechnology may allow us to live longer, but may leave us dependent on costly synthetic drugs. There are many similar examples.
 Increasingly, Western life is afflicted by the paradoxes of progress. Material circumstances keep improving, yet our quality of life may be no better as a result -- especially in those cases, like food, where enough becomes too much. 
 ''The maximum is not the optimum,'' the ecologist Garrett Hardin, who died last year, liked to say. Americans are choosing the maximum, and it does not necessarily make us healthier or happier.

HEADLINE: Officials Seek Approval to Begin Wider Testing for Bird Flu

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 13 

 BODY:
Government and poultry industry officials intend to expand testing for bird flu to cover most of the poultry raised in the United States, possibly this month, an Agriculture Department official said Friday.
 The $12.5 million program would focus on the most dangerous forms of the most common variety, low pathogenic avian influenza. These forms, known as H5 and H7, can be no worse than the chicken equivalent of the common cold. If left to spread, however, they can mutate into highly pathogenic varieties that can kill entire flocks in a day. 
 The new testing system could take effect March 29 if it gets final Bush administration approval, said Andrew Rhorer, senior coordinator of the Agriculture Department's poultry improvement plan. The plan was approved on March 5 by a committee of federal, state and industry officials that oversees the program, he said.
 Until now, low-path bird flu had gotten a low priority from regulators. The disease is found in nations worldwide, and governments are not required to notify international livestock health officials when an outbreak occurs. High-path flu, on the other hand, does require notification, which triggers poultry export embargoes.
 But even the low-path form can be economically devastating. Sick chickens do not grow as fast as healthy ones, so growers have to keep the birds longer and spend more on feed. States sometimes order flocks killed and have quarantined infected farms to prevent the virus from spreading. In addition, importing nations sometimes ban exports from low-path infected areas.
 Current testing for low-path bird flu focuses on birds raised for breeding that will be exported to nations which require certification that the animals are free of low-path bird flu, said T. J. Meyers, co-director of the Agriculture Department's National Center for Animal Health Programs.
 State health officials test other flocks if they hear of birds that show symptoms. There is no federal testing program for low-path bird flu.
 But the current system leaves out commercial flocks raised for meat or eggs, which are almost all of the nation's estimated 9 billion chickens. The new plan would change that, as well as allow tests in turkeys.
 Recent outbreaks of low-path bird flu in Delaware, Maryland and Pennsylvania led to a spate of bans which, after a separate high-path bird flu infected a flock in Texas, reached about 35 nations.
 The blood tests could be done on the farm or at the slaughterhouse, said Dr. John Smith, health and hatchery director of Fieldale Farms, a poultry company in Baldwin, Ga. As chairman of a poultry committee of the United States Animal Health Association, a livestock industry professional organization, Dr. Smith, a veterinarian, worked with the poultry improvement plan committee to draft the testing proposal.

WOODY GUTHRIE'S ghost must be getting exhausted. Ever since Guthrie -- the Oklahoma-born singer, writer and activist who wrote and recorded American classics like ''This Land Is Your Land'' -- died in 1967, musicians on the political left have been invoking his spirit. 
 Lately the invocation has grown insistent, as the singer-songwriters Steve Earle, Billy Bragg and Tom Morello -- and others featured in Tell Us the Truth, a recent concert tour protesting policies of the Bush administration -- have seemed to be trying to unearth Guthrie in an almost literal way. The Tell Us the Truth artists copy, conjure and channel Guthrie, and what emerges from all their reverence is a painted St. Woody, soapbox artist of the oppressed, emptied of the qualities that made Guthrie the messy, iconoclastic musical charmer he really was. In the process, normally incisive musicians like Mr. Bragg and Mr. Earle, not surprisingly, become boring. 
 But there's good news: the real Woody Guthrie -- a small and wired man who embraced irreverent satire, stark lyricism, spiritual aspiration and unpredictable silliness -- is getting a hearing, too. The Bottle Rockets, bar-style rockers with comedic smarts and a small, devoted following, don't express abject reverence toward Guthrie or make bald claims on his legacy. Yet his wilder presence is alive and kicking in their music. Treating guitar-drenched bar rock as a kind of American tradition, the Bottle Rockets' songwriting makes them the keepers of his idiosyncratic legacy. Boring they are not.
 The Bottle Rockets' new album, ''Blue Sky,'' expands on subject matter they have made their own in a handful of irresistible CD's. The Bottle Rockets recount ordinary problems -- sometimes romantic misadventures and inner turmoil but also, more characteristically, day-to-day hassles and joys -- with a self-deprecating, good-hearted wit.
 ''Blue Sky'' opens with the punningly titled ''Lucky Break,'' a rousing folk-rock anthem to being injured on the job and thus free to lie around collecting checks. In the intro, a lonely yet resilient harmonica skirls around the acoustic guitar -- a sound that Guthrie pioneered and generations of folkies have made an all-purpose signifier of sincerity. The chorus -- ''I fell down/ So here I lay,/ Got the Workman's Comp/ So everything's O.K'' -- is hilarious because it's truly stirring. A triumphant bridge dismisses the dignity of labor and worker solidarity with an offhandedness seemingly calculated to offend idealists.
 So is this Guthrie parody or Guthrie homage? Both, it appears. The song may mock Guthrie the naively earnest bard of labor, but it draws energy from Guthrie the freely confrontational American poet. The verses' deft rhymes, conversational tone and eye for specifics -- Bottle Rockets trademarks -- recall Guthrie satires like ''So Long, It's Been Good to Know Yuh,'' which makes social comedy out of a destructive dust storm. That song skewers authority, in the form of an end-is-near preacher who nevertheless makes sure to pass the plate, and rhymes ''text,'' ''specs'' and ''collection'' as if there were nothing to it.
 Like ''So Long,'' ''Lucky Break'' gets laughs from bleak realism and rhyming wit. The Bottle Rockets have actually written a new kind of labor protest song, a dark and ambiguous one that also insists on being infectious and fun, that evokes ordinary people's struggles without resorting to arid agitprop, just like Guthrie at his best.
 Guthrie's sprawling catalog includes ''Hard Travelin','' about a migrant's endless search for work, which bubbles along with such pleasure in language and rhythm that it underplays (and thus makes real) the rigors it describes. His ''Do Re Me'' treats with joyous sarcasm the disappointments faced by Dust Bowl refugees in California.
 The Bottle Rockets pick up on these qualities in songs like ''Man of Constant Anxiety'' (also on ''Blue Sky''), which laughs at the ''O Brother'' cult of hillbilly authenticity while listing the mounting pressures on a real working person. (The song's almost one-note guitar solo is a brilliantly funny evocation of inner agitation.) ''Gotta Get Up,'' from the Bottle Rockets' earlier ''Brand New Year,'' is a driving rock nightmare that doesn't so much describe as embody the breathless, rat-on-a-wheel cycle of work week and weekend.
 As in Guthrie's best writing, these and the band's other songs lessen the power of economic hardships not by indulging in slogans, or even soliciting a listener's sympathy, but simply by naming those troubles, even reveling in them, with a kind of ferocious delight.
 The Bottle Rockets' ''Welfare Music'' (from the album ''The Brooklyn Side'') devotes an entire verse to a baby dancing on the floor, falling down, getting up. That verse recalls another aspect of Guthrie's work: ingeniously action-inspiring tunes like ''Put Your Finger in the Air'' and ''Riding in My Car.''
 Guthrie's many children's songs, which seem almost too basic to have authorship, distill the pleasure in movement that marks the most vital parts of his catalog. They are a window into his purest creative method, which sprang from impulses far more primal than any desire to browbeat.
 It's true that as part of the 1930's and 40's ''people's songs'' movement, Guthrie wrote dumb ditties under the aegis of the American Communist Party, supporting Stalinism and opposing American entry into World War II. In the same driven, lock-step party mood, he put the slogan ''This Machine Kills Fascists'' on his guitar, a move admired and even copied by Tell Us the Truth artists, who sometimes seem nostalgic not for a poet but for a party hack. The Bottle Rockets tap into the vein of play, expressed most fundamentally in Guthrie's children's songs, which inspires a far more generous range of moods than overdetermined sloganeering can.
 That kind of play takes a rowdy, grown-up form in rock 'n' roll, which can, of course, embrace the political, the romantic, the sexual, even the depressed. In the Bottle Rockets' music, Woody Guthrie lives on in ways that don't reduce his humanity and originality to cliches, despite his own all-too-human tendency, at times, to reduce himself.

HEADLINE: Wholesalers Eye Queens As a Warehouse Wonderland

BYLINE: By JIM O'GRADY

 BODY:
Jay Chung, a wholesaler of desk clocks and snow globes on West 27th Street near the Avenue of the Americas, believes that he and his business partner have found his industry's promised land in northern Queens. It is 26 acres of soggy soil that was once Flushing Airport and is now part of the College Point Corporate Park, a low-lying area convenient to several expressways and La Guardia Airport. 
 Mr. Chung and 52 other wholesalers have proposed to spend $175 million to construct a two-story, 585,000-square-foot warehouse complex that could be a center for 180 wholesale businesses. In one swoop, the project would shift New York's traditional wholesale district, around Broadway between 25th and 35th Streets in Manhattan, to Queens. And as far as Mr. Chung is concerned, the move cannot come soon enough. 
 ''The rent is sky-high and rising and traffic every day here is worse,'' he said from his office in Manhattan. ''A lot of buyers have difficulty parking, and you need to park to buy.'' In addition, six residential high-rises have sprung up in the district in recent years, and many of the residents are not happy about living among the cluster of wholesale businesses. 
 A few weeks ago, the city's Economic Development Corporation chose the warehouse proposal from among 12 plans to develop the site, in part because the agency believes that the center would bring 600 existing jobs to the area and create 420 new jobs over five to seven years. 
 But some local civic groups and elected officials are unhappy about not having had a chance to evaluate the various proposals. ''We never saw them,'' said Adrian Joyce, a member of Community Board 7. ''The mayor spoke out prematurely when he said he was going to do this.'' 
 Mr. Joyce said he was concerned that local roads would be overwhelmed by truck traffic and that savvy shoppers might go to the warehouse to buy items at wholesale prices, bringing even more traffic. ''Who's going to police them to stop them from selling retail?'' he asked. 
 In response, Mr. Chung said that his company, College Point Wholesale Distribution Development, would turn away ordinary shoppers and allow in only buyers with federal tax ID's for retail businesses. 
 Janel Patterson, an Economic Development Corporation spokeswoman, said the project would provide other benefits, like the $2 million Mr. Chung's company has committed to build a nature trail around the site's perimeter. The city has also set aside $8 million to improve local traffic flow by repairing and perhaps extending nearby Linden Place, which is closed because of chronic flooding. 
 But Mr. Joyce and his allies remain opposed. They plan more meetings and -- although Ms. Patterson said her agency does not customarily divulge unchosen proposals -- they hope to learn about them so they can be presented in the court of public opinion. 
 ''This is not a dead issue,'' Mr. Joyce said. JIM O'GRADY

HEADLINE: Governor Gambles on a Developer Who's a Preservationist

BYLINE: By JOHN SULLIVAN

DATELINE: CAPE MAY 

 BODY:
GOVERNOR McGREEVEY sat in the dining room of the Congress Hall hotel one early fall morning two years ago, enjoying a rare moment of calm -- no urgent messages from his staff, no ringing phones. So he could well have felt a twinge of annoyance when a slim, well-dressed man approached, quietly introduced himself as the owner of the hotel, and asked if there was anything he could do to improve his guest's stay.
 What's good for breakfast? the governor asked, gesturing for the man to sit. Oatmeal with blueberries, replied the man -- special of the house. 
 With this inquiry the mayor's breakfast partner, the developer Curtis Bashaw, was displaying his trademark hotelier's attentiveness. But the conversation, continuing off and on over meetings at the hotel for the next few days, showcased other talents of Mr. Bashaw's, as well as his ideas about the future of the Jersey Shore and how Atlantic City's casino gambling fits into that picture. 
 By the time the governor was ready to return to Trenton, he said in a recent interview, he thought Mr. Bashaw was someone worth remembering. And this February he named Mr. Bashaw to head the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority, an obscure but powerful agency that funnels tens of millions of dollars to development projects along the shore each year. The authority, known by its acronym, Creda, has slowly changed the region since its creation 20 years ago, paying for roads, hotel rooms, apartment buildings and shopping districts. 
 Gambling had long been weighing on the governor's mind. A bruising fight over the amount that casinos pay in taxes occasioned a stock-taking, and what it revealed wasn't pretty: after years of growth, gambling revenues were flat, and Atlantic City faced increasing threats from new casinos in New York, as well as video lottery terminals planned for neighboring states. 
 The more Mr. McGreevey studied the situation, the more he felt that the bet on gambling had been too heavy; outside of the casinos, there was little to attract people to Atlantic City, despite its 40,000-strong population. For one thing, he learned that while Atlantic City and Las Vegas have almost identical gambling revenue -- about $4 billion -- Las Vegas doubles that amount through restaurants, hotels and retail. In Atlantic City, those revenues are negligible. 
 ''We have lacked a coherent vision in Atlantic City,'' the governor said in the interview. 
 He clearly views Mr. Bashaw -- with his hotelier's background -- as the antidote to that problem. Yet in many ways Mr. Bashaw is an unusual choice. He has no government background and little experience in dealing with casinos, which have dominated the region's development for over 20 years. 
 As for the industry itself, it seems to welcome new blood.
 ''New ideas and development experience is what the job requires,'' said Bob Boughner, chief executive of the Borgata, the newest and largest hotel and casino in the city.
 Judging from Mr. Bashaw's resume, he would appear to have both. He developed his first hotel before he turned 30, and his projects in Cape May have become linchpins of its resurgence. Plus, the governor said, the man knows his hotels. ''The oatmeal was delicious,'' he said.

'South Bronx by the Seashore'
 When voters approved gambling for Atlantic City in 1976, one of its primary goals was the renewal of a metropolis racked by crime, poverty and decay. ''It was a bleak urban situation,'' said James W. Hughes, dean of Rutgers University's Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy, and author of a book on the city. ''Before the first casino opened in 1978, the best characterization of Atlantic City at the time was the South Bronx by the seashore.''
 Gambling, Dr. Hughes said, promised an immediate influx of cash. And in one way the promise has been fulfilled.
 The city has ''one of the strongest economic bases of any city in New Jersey,'' he said. ''The casino industry is a very powerful industry; it represents about 40,000 jobs.''
 But at the same time, many feel that the influx has not done enough to improve the lives of Atlantic City residents.
 ''The promise of gambling was that it would be a unique tool of urban development,'' said Bryant Simon, a University of Georgia history professor who is writing a book on gambling and Atlantic City. ''By that measure it has failed.''
 Professor Simon is not the only one to point out that the city has lost population, services and businesses since the casinos opened.
 ''When gambling came, there were still five movie theaters in town; there were still supermarkets; there were still a fair number of stores on Atlantic Avenue,'' he said. ''All that stuff is gone now.''
 He does not hold the casinos financially responsible for those changes. In fact, through special taxes, the industry has contributed billions to both city and state over the past 20 years. Rather, he said, it is the very nature of gambling in Atlantic City that has created pockets of wealth surrounded by poverty. 
 ''They wanted the casinos to be self-contained -- that is why the oceanfront hotels have no ocean views,'' Professor Simon said. ''The effect was to create 12 separate islands.''
 The effect was also to base the city's economy almost entirely on gambling. Unlike Las Vegas, which derives nearly half its revenue from tourists who patronize restaurants and other attractions, Atlantic City has little to offer apart from the gambling floors.
 That is something everyone concerned wants to change.
 ''We all have a common goal in making sure that Atlantic City is a place to go for more than playing the slot machines,'' said State Senator William Gormley, a Republican who represents the city.
 Although the senator agrees with Professor Simon's main point, he disputes much of his analysis. He asserted that the city had made great efforts to develop a non-gambling economy, with the construction of the Atlantic City Convention Center and a 400,000-square-foot shopping area that recently opened downtown. 
 He also said the casino industry was investing in other attractions. 
 For instance the Borgata, which opened last year, has restaurants and shopping as well as gambling. ''Diversification is essential for the future,'' said Mr. Boughner, the Borgata C.E.O. ''We fashioned the Borgata more along the lines of a Las Vegas hotel, versus being trapped by the constraints of the Atlantic City model.''
 The casino owners have endorsed the idea of expanding their revenue base. The owners of the Tropicana and Caesar's both plan new space for restaurants and shopping, and the casino trade organization is calling for a large increase in the number of hotel rooms.
 ''The difference between Las Vegas and Atlantic City is simple,'' said Mark Sandson, the lawyer for the Casino Association of New Jersey. ''Vegas has 120,000 hotel rooms, and Atlantic City has 14,000. Real growth in Atlantic City is going to be about developing a non-gaming infrastructure.''
 With most of the money for improvements flowing through Creda, Mr. Bashaw's appointment to head it amounts to a clear signal that the governor wants to diversify the city's attractions. In fact he described Mr. Bashaw -- with his background in hotel development and master's degree in finance from Wharton -- as the ideal person to remake the city.
 ''He has the vision and the tenacity to bring about change,'' Mr. McGreevey said. ''Look at the change he has brought to Congress Hall and Cape May.''

The Lessons of Cape May
 Perched on a hill just beyond a curve of Beach Avenue, the imposing edifice of the Congress Hall hotel looms over Cape May's gingerbread Victorians like an oak tree in an ornamental garden. Four stories tall, yellow brick with soaring pillars and a slate mansard roof, the hotel breathes power like a small bit of Washington scooped up and dropped on the Jersey Shore.
 Originally built in 1816, the hotel was the summer White House for presidents from Buchanan to Harrison and was celebrated in John Philip Sousa's ''Congress Hall March.''
 Like the rest of Cape May, the Congress Hall was a celebrated destination of the steamship era. Passengers moving up the coast found the town a convenient stopping point on the way to New York, and wealthy vacationers from Washington and Philadelphia colonized the spot, enjoying the salt air and ocean breezes. Photos from the era show gentlemen with boaters and ladies with parasols strolling along the seafront, or playing baseball and tennis on the Congress Hall's great law.
 But railroads changed all that. Newport, the Hamptons and Atlantic City began to draw the crowds. By the 1960s, the city had declined, and the Congress Hall was no exception: it had been taken over as a retreat and Bible study institute by Carl McIntire, a fire-breathing radio evangelist who became famous for broadcasting his ''Radio Free America'' program from a ship off the coast of New Jersey. When he was not thumping Satan and Communism over the airwaves, Rev. McIntire was a preservationist, buying up buildings like the Congress Hall and the even larger Admiral Hotel and decorating with bits of Americana like cannons or the anchor to a sunken galleon.
 Curtis Bashaw, one of the reverend's grandchildren, practically grew up in Congress Hall, absorbing its sense of history and design. ''It was like Eloise at the Plaza,'' he said. 
 He was expected to follow his grandfather into the ministry, and attended Wheaton College, a Christian school in Illinois. Two years was enough to persuade him to pursue law instead. 
 Then, in his senior year, his grandfather called, asking him to return and take over the Congress Hall.
 ''I kept deferring law school,'' Mr. Bashaw said, ''and I just fell in here.''
 ''Just falling in'' involved buying another old boarding house in the neighborhood, in 1986. With support from his father, a successful lawyer in Princeton, and his brother-in-law, he refurbished the building, reopening it as the Virginia Hotel. 
 ''The Virginia was closed and had been condemned for 15 years,'' said Tom Carroll, owner of the Mainstay hotel nearby. ''Ninety-nine percent of developers would have said, 'Tear it down and start from scratch,' but Curtis took the tougher approach.''
 About the time Mr. Bashaw became deeply involved in the Virginia project, his grandfather's finances were deteriorating. By the 1990's the bible institute was facing bankruptcy. Its two big hotels, the Congress Hall and the Admiral, went on the auction block. Both were in bad shape. Congress Hall was old and sagging, with cramped rooms and shaky plumbing. The roof leaked, the wiring was ancient, and the only air-conditioning was a few ceiling fans. The Admiral was even worse off. 
 After showing the buildings to dozens of potential buyers, Mr. Bashaw feared they would be torn down. Rather than let that happen, he gathered a group of investors and created a controversial financing plan: Realizing that he could not save both structures, he proposed to demolish the Admiral, sell the land for housing and use the money to refurbish Congress Hall.
 ''Everyone gave us heat,'' Mr. Bashaw said. ''The city wanted to save the Admiral, but they did not want to give up their $85,000 a year in property taxes.'' 
 Preservationists have since said the destruction of the building was a disaster, but Mr. Bashaw argues that it would have cost $45 million to restore the old hotel -- far more than he and his partners could have raised. In fact, he says, it was only by selling the land under the building that he managed to raise enough to afford the $20 million refurbishment of Congress Hall. 
 ''The old Admiral was a mistake when they built it,'' said Mr. Carroll, who is a former chairman of the New Jersey Historic Trust. ''It failed five times as a hotel, and its only success was when it was used a hospital during the war.'' 
 Yet the decision to demolish the Admiral still haunts Mr. Bashaw, in large part because its destruction hurt his grandfather, who died in 2002. Mr. Bashaw likened the demolition to losing a relative. 
 ''They tore it down, bit by bit,'' he said. 
 The Congress Hall was a much happier story. Mr. Bashaw and his partners began renovation of the Congress Hall in 2000, setting out to modernize without losing the historic feel of the place. More than 16,800 slate tiles were shaped and added to the leaking roof; aging cedar posts at the center of the hotel's dramatic columns were reinforced with pressure-treated support beams, and the entire wooden ballroom floor was carefully pulled up, refurbished and replaced. Mr. Bashaw also retained most of the original fixtures, from hall lights to wooden room doors.
 ''It looks like an old building, but it is an old building with modern amenities,'' said Luciano Corea, the Cape May city manager. ''It was an outstanding job.''
 The project had its detractors. A group of neighbors sued, on the ground that Mr. Bashaw was not following proper procedures under federal historic preservation rules. Neighbors also objected to his decision to pave part of the building's lawn and use it for hotel parking. 
 ''That lawn is one of the gems of Cape May,'' said George Lesser, an opponent who owns a house across the street from the hotel. ''We thought there were better uses rather than as a parking lot.''
 While describing himself as a supporter of the renovation, Mr. Lesser criticized Mr. Bashaw's decision to use architectural elements from the Admiral as part of the new Congress Hall.
 ''The people who built the Admiral hated the Congress Hall, they are diametrically opposed styles,'' Mr. Lesser said. ''To take pieces of one and smash them into the other shows a lack of sensitivity.''
 Mr. Bashaw's response is that the approach allowed him to preserve part of an otherwise lost structure. The Admiral's wrought-iron staircase, for instance, now connects two floors of Congress Hall.
 Mr. Bashaw recently added a third business, the Star motel, to his holdings in Cape May. If the Virginia is designed to be snug and cozy, and the Congress Hall magnificent and historic, the Star, with flat-screen televisions and bright pastel colors, is supposed to be fun and accessible for families. Mr. Bashaw says he thinks of the Congress Hall as the grand dame of Cape May, and the Star as ''the frisky little cousin.''
 The Congress Hall renovation sparked a larger debate within Cape May, on whether to remain a sleepy hamlet or become a tourist destination. People like Mr. Lesser argued that the city was in danger of losing its character by trying to attract tourists at the expense of residents.
 ''One could argue that what Curtis Bashaw has been trying to do over the years is make Cape May more like Atlantic City,'' Mr. Lesser said. ''A lot of people in Cape May would really be delighted if they could tear down the Victorian piles and build Trump-type hotels along the beach.''
 But Mr. Bashaw's supporters argue that projects like the Congress Hall renovation are the only way to save the historic structures that the preservationists love. They say a slow decline is no future.
 ''It was outstanding,'' said Mr. Corea, the town manager, of the renovation. ''That hotel has revitalized the area.''
 The question now is, can Mr. Bashaw work the same magic on the impoverished pockets of Atlantic City? 
 He says he is eager to get to work. On April 1 he intends to begin by scheduling rounds of meetings with city leaders and casino executives to get a feel for what needs to be done.
 His own view of his mission: ''To help make Atlantic City a nice place to live and a nice place to visit, the way it was in the 1920's.''
 Or, in other words, ''to seize the title again of being America's playground.''

HEADLINE: Just One of the Guys, Under Investigation

BYLINE: By David Kocieniewski. 
David Kocieniewski is Trenton bureau chief of The New York Times.

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
As he rose from the obscurity of Middlesex County politics to the throne of New Jersey government, Governor McGreevey's most valuable asset was his unfailing ability to play the ''just one of da guys'' card.
 Challenging the genteel Gov. Christie Whitman in 1997, Mr. McGreevey focused on economic issues that squeezed the middle class -- property taxes and auto insurance -- in a plainspoken style that sounded like echoes from a Bayonne diner. Mrs. Whitman narrowly won re-election, and had left office before Mr. McGreevey's next run for governor in 2001, but that didn't stop ''Jim from Carteret'' from painting the entire Republican Party in the same gilded hues. 
 One of the most effective McGreevey campaign ads that year featured the aspiring governor in a bomber jacket, driving a car over the Pulaski Skyway (the acropolis of smokestacks and closed factories in the background), criticizing Republicans with a street-corner put-down: ''Hey guys, you blew a precious opportunity.''
 Given Mr. McGreevey's unrelenting attempts to identify himself with New Jersey's gritty, struggling classes, it should come as little surprise that his political fate may now hinge on his relationship with a waste management executive. No, this is not ''The Sopranos'' (and there has never been any suggestion that the waste management executive in question, David D'Amiano, has the slightest bit of involvement with organized crime), but the federal investigation into the McGreevey administration's dealings with Mr. D'Amiano appear likely to dominate -- and perhaps transform -- state politics in the next year.
 Federal agents recently subpoenaed records from the governor's office, state Democratic headquarters and the treasurer's office, and are trying to determine whether Mr. D'Amiano, a McGreevey fund-raiser, got favors in exchange for donations. Investigators also subpoenaed records from the state Department of Agriculture, and are reportedly examining whether the governor or any aides interceded in a land dispute on behalf of a contributor drummed up by Mr. D'Amiano.
 Mr. McGreevey and his aides insist that no one in the administration did anything improper. But there are unmistakable signs that all sides are bracing for a vicious legal and political battle. It is unclear what evidence United States Attorney Christopher Christie's investigators have gathered, but it was enough to persuade a federal judge to authorize a search warrant for the office of a sitting governor. Mr. Christie, who is often mentioned as a Republican candidate for governor next year, is savvy enough to realize that it would be politically disastrous to conduct such a high-profile raid if it turned out to be a smear attempt.
 Meanwhile Mr. McGreevey, the state committee and two of his top aides -- Kevin Hagan and Amy Mansue -- have lined up high-priced, high-powered legal teams to defend them from any fallout from the investigation.
 Despite those rather ominous signals, many Democrats say it is far too early to panic. The high cost of political advertising on television forces nearly every campaign to scrounge for cash in uncomfortable places, so it is not unusual for a scrupulous candidate to have a handful of unsavory characters among his fund-raisers.
 If the federal investigation relied on unethical cooperating witnesses but failed to make a convincing case against any members of the McGreevey administration, the United States attorney's office could conceivably end up the villain of the entire episode. Just last year, Mayor John Street of Philadelphia's struggling re-election campaign was rocked by the news that the F.B.I. had bugged his office, and the revelation brought such a surge of sympathy that he cruised to re-election.
 But the most worrisome development for the McGreevey administration are reports that some of the figures involved in the investigation were wearing concealed recording devices, taping conversations with political officials. Bismarck, who once cautioned that anyone who liked laws or sausages should not watch them being made, would almost certainly be appalled to see the spectacularly unseemly way modern campaign contributions are solicited -- even legitimate contributions.
 Even before the D'Amiano investigation began generating ugly headlines, the administration had been dogged by three different fund-raising inquiries involving Mr. McGreevey's compatriots from his days as mayor of Woodbridge. If this case revealed that the administration did indeed deliver political favors, Mr. McGreevey, who faces re-election next year, could see his sagging poll numbers drop even more.
 Mr. McGreevey's communications director, Cathy Ellis, brushed aside suggestions that his associates from North Jersey had caused him an inordinate amount of political torment. She also predicted that, in the end, the facts will prove that the McGreevey administration upheld the highest ethical standards.
 ''What will be shown is that there's no there there,'' she said.
 Whatever the investigation ultimately unearths, it has already demonstrated that in a state like New Jersey, where municipal government is a blood sport, political loyalty can carry a very high price. The kind of scrappy operatives who help fight local political battles don't always stand up to the glare of statewide scrutiny. And if an officeholder isn't careful about his associates from the old neighborhood, he runs the risk of being sent back to that neighborhood far sooner than he might have wished.

HEADLINE: Lasting Discord Clouds Talks On North Korean Nuclear Arms

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 13 

 BODY:
Almost two weeks after North Korea agreed to new, supposedly more intimate ''working groups'' to discuss its nuclear weapons program, Bush administration officials say that the agenda for the talks remains unclear and that the discussions may not occur until April or May.
 The idea of trying to resolve disagreements over North Korea's nuclear programs in one or more working groups came up in the last round of talks in Beijing at the end of February. Besides the United States and North Korea, Russia, China, South Korea and Japan took part.
 Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said afterward that he was ''quite satisfied'' with how they went and that the working groups established ''an institutionalized process to move forward in further discussions.'' 
 The objective, according to administration officials, is to create an unpressured atmosphere in which North Korea may feel more free to negotiate steps toward the American demand for a ''complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantlement'' of its nuclear programs.
 But there is dissent in the administration over how much the talks with North Korea accomplished and whether the working groups will produce further progress. ''The premise is wrong,'' said an American official. ''If the North Koreans are not willing to show flexibility at a high level, they're not going to let their munchkins do the job.''
 The framework of the Bush administration's approach is to insist on an upfront pledge by North Korea to dismantle its programs, and then to grant benefits -- from security guarantees to economic and energy assistance -- in return for step-by-step progress toward that goal.
 Hard-liners in the administration say the main disappointment of the most recent talks was the failure to get a commitment on the dismantling of the weapons. Those who favor a more conciliatory approach say the main accomplishment was to get all the other participants in the talks to agree that North Korea must commit itself to that goal.
 A top administration official described the proceedings as ''grueling'' and said that even minor progress was a real victory. ''The consensus among us is that this is a ground game,'' he said, using a football metaphor. ''We're going to move the ball five yards at a time.''
 American and Asian diplomats said the biggest disappointment occurred because of a last-minute snag on the last day of the talks in Beijing, when the six nations could not agree to a statement committing themselves to the working groups format.
 North Korea, several diplomats said, came in with a last-minute demand that the final statement include a reference to its disagreement on fundamental issues with Washington, viewed by the American delegation as a step backward. In the absence of a joint statement, Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing of China announced a consensus for working groups on his own.
 An Asian diplomat said the Chinese delegates were ''very, very disappointed and probably annoyed'' over North Korea's move. An American official described Mr. Li and other Chinese officials as furious.
 Another clash at the meetings occurred over the American insistence that North Korea acknowledge not only its plutonium program but also its efforts to make a nuclear bomb with highly enriched uranium. North Korea has acknowledged the first method but not the second.
 The leader of the American delegation, James A. Kelly, an assistant secretary of state, recalled at a recent Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing that the North Korean delegate demanded proof it had a uranium enrichment program. Mr. Kelly said he replied, ''If I were to give you all that information, it might make it easier for you to conceal it.''
 Administration officials said Mr. Bush had telephoned President Roh Moo Hyun of South Korea in February to make sure his delegates would offer energy assistance to the North only in return for an upfront commitment on disarmament. In the end, the offer was transmitted in exactly the fashion that Mr. Bush wanted, an administration official said, adding, ''That was huge.''
 Another major victory tallied by administration officials had to do with China more than North Korea. Many American officials say that they were elated that China had basically endorsed the American approach and that the five parties were lined up against North Korea.
 ''I'll be frank,'' the American official said. ''The Chinese and Russians would like us to give more goodies, but now they're pushing the North Koreans in the direction we want. Those are things we've never had before.''

HEADLINE: Bargains Draw Visitors To Bustling Buenos Aires

BYLINE: By TONY SMITH

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES 

 BODY:
BULLDOZERS and cranes vie with limousines these days on the Avenida Alvear, in Buenos Aires's ritzy Recoleta neighborhood, as construction workers race to transform one of the Argentine capital's most elegant palaces into the exclusive wing of a new 180-room Hyatt hotel.
 The refurbishment of the residence of the Duhau family dating from the 1930's will cost $60 million and is scheduled to open in the spring of 2005. According to Roberto Ferrari, the project's coordinator, it ''will be sophisticated and glamorous.''
 Argentina might still be on its economic sickbed, recovering from four years of bitter recession, but its woes -- and particularly the sharp drop in the value of the peso -- have been a boon to foreign tourists. 
 Millions of them -- Americans, Brazilians, Spaniards, Italians and Germans -- are flocking to this, ''the Paris of South America,'' to sample its tango, and its abundant museums, sophisticated restaurants and great shopping, at bargain prices.
 According to a study published recently by the city's economic development office, Cedem, three million foreign tourists visited Buenos Aires last year, some 50 percent more than in 2002. In the first quarter of 2004 alone, about 1.5 million visitors are expected. For nearly 10 years until early 2002, the peso had been pegged to the dollar at parity, meaning dinner at Sucre, one of the capital's toniest restaurants, used to cost $75 a head with wine. A room at a midrange hotel such as a Holiday Inn would typically cost nearly $200 a night.
 Today, with the Argentine currency now trading at just under 3 to the dollar, a dinner for two with wine at Sucre should cost well under $50. A midrange hotel, such as the Lancaster on the Avenida Cordoba, can cost as little as $45 a night, about half the price before devaluation, while a room at the Holiday Inn Express can cost as little as $85. A double at the elegant Marriott Plaza on the Plaza San Martin costs just over $100.
 Rates for Argentines at cheaper hotels can be even lower; otherwise, hotel managers argue, they would have no local clients. But Arturo Garcia Rosa, president of HVS, hotel consultants in Argentina, and other tourism professionals advise against haggling for the rates charged to locals. Bargaining doesn't normally work, unless you are staying for a month or so. 
 ''Rates in general are dramatically lower,'' said Mr. Garcia Rosa. ''Four-star hotels are half the price they used to be and are about $100 a night cheaper than in most main capitals.''
 While the new Hyatt's rooms -- at $300 a night -- will be far from cheap, Mr. Ferrari says he is counting on increasing demand: occupancy rates in the city, even at the most expensive five-star hotels, are over 75 percent, more than double what they were in the depths of the 2001 crisis.
 Hotel development is not limited to the new Hyatt. Another luxury hotel, run by Sofitel, the French chain, has recently opened in the Recoleta district, while the Alvear Palace, long the capital's best-known luxury hotel, is refurbishing some of its rooms to meet demand. And restaurants are taking heart from the boom and expanding. Last year Orient Express Hotels opened La Cabana, a faithful re-creation of one of the city's most celebrated establishments, on Rodriguez Pena. The original, patronized by figures such as Eva Peron, Richard M. Nixon and the Aga Khan, closed in 1996 as Argentina slid into financial crisis. 
 ''The devaluation changed the scenario overnight,'' said Lucas Rentero, co-founder of Eternautas, a Buenos Aires operator offering private tours in several languages focusing on the capital's history and culture.
 For two years after February 1999, when Mr. Rentero and his two partners set up Eternautas, they personally guided two or three tours a week. Today, the partners, plus a team of 10 multilingual guides, take out as many as seven tours a day.
 ''Our prices are down by 30 or 40 percent,'' said Mr. Rentero, explaining that some of the currency gains have been eaten away by inflation. ''But we still charge only half the price you would pay for a private guide in a European capital.'' A half-day tour for two people with car, driver and English-speaking guide currently costs $62. For a group of 10, the price is $14 a head.
 ''I just fell in love with the place,'' said Judy Milliken, a retired travel agent from St. Petersburg, Fla., who took Eternautas's Evita tour in November. ''I just loved the architecture, the tango, Evita, the cafe culture, the great food -- and where else can you get a great bottle of wine for $4? It's terribly inexpensive.''
 So what are the best buys? Because prices of imports have risen as a result of devaluation, ''made in Argentina'' is back in fashion. On the Calle Florida, the city's main shopping street, lots of new talabarterias -- stores selling handmade leather and silver goods -- have sprung up. Shops specializing in indigenous arts and crafts, such as Pueblo Indio in the San Telmo district or Arte Etnico Argentino in Palermo Viejo, offer colorful blankets and rugs, ethnic furniture, masks and sculptures.
 Another good buy is Argentine wine, which is beginning to gain recognition. Jaime Chmea, partner at the Winery on the Avenida Leandro N. Alem, who has increased the wine store-restaurants in his chain from two to five in the past 18 months and is about to open another next to the dockside Hilton, says prices of top vintages in dollars have risen to precrisis levels, but that most wines are still a bargain.
 A Malbec from the vinyards of Escorihuela Gascon, a local favorite, costs about $10, while an Angelica Zapata Malbec, which sells for $60 in New York, costs $35 here.
 ''In January 2002, I can tell you business was depressed and I was depressed,'' said Mr. Chmea, ''but not anymore!''

HEADLINE: The Incredible Shrinking Dollar

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL. 
ALAN COWELL is a correspondent for The Times based in London.

 BODY:
EARLY last year, an American arriving in Europe might have reckoned that a dollar exchanged for pounds or euros might just suffice to buy a newspaper or maybe, in some places, a coffee. Twelve months later, don't be so sure.
 Over the last year the dollar has fallen by between one-fifth and one-quarter against both currencies. In February, it reached its lowest level in 12 years against the British pound and dropped to its weakest level against the euro since the European Union's common currency was introduced on the international money markets in 1999. 
 In mid-February, the euro touched $1.28, compared to $1.05 in March 2003, while the pound hit $1.90 compared to $1.55 in April 2003. And those were just the official rates for trading on the currency markets -- not the far less generous rates used in exchange booths or credit card transactions, which can be 10 percent more expensive.
 Some Americans reported paying over $2 for a pound in London, and the idea of one-to-one parity between the dollar and the euro -- last recorded in November 2002 -- became no more than a wistful memory. At those inflated rates, a Starbucks frappucino would come in at over $6.50 and, in London, only Britain's racy tabloids cost less than $1. Sending an airmail postcard from Rome to the United States costs $1.80; a Caesar salad at the Adlon Hotel in Berlin is now $16; and in Paris, a silk scarf from Hermes comes in at $310. It's hardly surprising, then, that hoteliers and others say the number of Americans, once viewed as the kingpins among tourists in Europe, is down sharply. 
 ''Americans don't want to travel any more,'' said Jean-Louis Descoins, manager of the Hotel Bel Ami in the St.-Germain-des- Pres district of Paris. ''There was a little revival after the end of the Iraq war but now with the fall of the dollar everything is stagnant.''
 The fall in the dollar, moreover, is only the latest in a series of setbacks. American tourism had barely begun to rebound from the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the campaign against terrorism deterred foreign travel. 
 ''There is definitely a shortage of American visitors,'' said Bob Barton, a spokesman for Visit Britain, an official body promoting foreign tourism. ''Some of it is still connected to concerns about security. American visitors are noticeable by their absence and the exchange rate isn't helping.''
 Yet, in conversations with Americans in London, Paris and Rome, some visitors seemed to have drawn on a doughty resolve in the face of adversity.
 Hotel discounts and low air fares have persuaded some Americans to come to Europe. Some had booked vacations at more favorable, locked-in prices. Many Americans said they were spending less, avoiding stores and eating cheaply. 
 ''There are a lot of food emporiums near our hotel and we just buy food and a bottle of wine and take it back to the hotel,'' said Renee Margulies, from Philadelphia, who is visiting London with her husband, Milton. The couple, who are retired, talked to a reporter in a tourism office in Regent Street, where she said London ''is costing us 25 to 30 percent more than last year, and it's sort of a shock.''
 On the south bank of the River Thames, at the London Eye Ferris wheel (which now costs $22 for an adult ticket), Colleen Kerr, an education administrator from Denver, said she and a colleague, Amy Weed, planned their trip to London when the exchange rate stood at $1.75 to the pound last year. When she arrived in London in February, the exchange rate at Heathrow Airport -- admittedly, airports are not known for attractive exchange rates -- was a staggering $2.09. ''We are having to be very careful,'' she said.
 Some people have been put off though, particularly by airline security scares, said Monica Barrington, who runs Uptown Reservations, an upscale bed-and-breakfast agency based in London. ''Not only have you got the exchange rate, you've got the planes being grounded.''
 Those worries echo in France.
 In Paris, the Tourism Office says, the number of American visitors fell by 26 percent, to 3,135,600 between January and November 2003 compared to the same period in 2002. Part of the decline reflects American resentment of French opposition to the war in Iraq, according to some visitors. ''There's a backlash against France, a big backlash,'' said Mr. Margulies. 
 Some hoteliers believe fear of terrorism is keeping Americans at home. Pascal Gimel, manager of the D'Aubusson hotel in the St.-Germain area said Americans were once 75 percent of its guests, but that share had fallen by half since Al Qaeda's attacks on American targets. ''We did a promotion offering 1 euro for 1 dollar,'' he said. ''But we still haven't recovered from Sept. 11.''
 The constraints on hoteliers and tour operators seem to have offered some compensations. Strolling along the Champs-Elysees, Nancy Crow, 33, a real-estate agent from Milwaukee said: ''I don't know if the dollar has something to do with it, but the French are much more friendly this time than they were two years ago.'' 
 In February, the tour operator Contiki, based in Anaheim, Calif., which arranges escorted European tours for 18- to 35-year-olds, and the Royal Scotsman, which runs luxury train trips in Scotland -- ranging from $990 a person for a one-night trip to $7,590 for a seven-night tour -- offered guarantees that vacations priced in dollars would not be affected by currency fluctuations. 
 Not everyone sees those silver linings, particularly in Italy where the weakness of the dollar has compounded price increases introduced stealthily by many restaurants and cafe owners when the euro replaced the lira. Jon R. Snyder, director of the Rome Studies Center of the University of California, suggested that different Americans felt the squeeze in different ways. In particular, he pointed to the impact on Californians studying in Italy.
 ''Basically it's a triple whammy,'' he said. ''You have the dollar's total collapse, and then on top of that you have the changeover from lira to euro, which has added an enormous amount to prices, and third you have the economic crisis in California.'' 
 ''Some of the students here have real economic difficulties,'' he said. ''They get their financial aid, but it's in dollars. They end up having to choose between a coffee at the cafe or sending a postcard home. They are really feeling the pinch.''

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 While no one should begrudge Indians and others in the developing world their opportunity to take advantage of the benefits of modernization, their success is not due solely to ''good timing, hard work, talent and luck'' (column, March 11).
 The export of thousands of jobs overseas since the 1970's has more to do with specific United States economic policies, particularly free trade and deregulation, that have resulted domestically in corporations and wealthy individuals increasing their fortunes and the standard of living of American workers remaining stagnant.
 The effect is much like the recent economic ''recovery.'' The rising stock market indicates that someone is doing well, but the vast majority of ordinary people never see the money ''trickle down.''

HEADLINE: A $713 Ashtray Built on Landfill

BYLINE: By Jessica Bruder

 BODY:
Of course, if a person must smoke, it's a good idea to have an ashtray, and the officials at the Cumberland County Improvement Authority have the most stylish one in New Jersey. 
 How can you tell? Because they paid $713 for it.
 Adorning the entrance to the authority's office in Millville, the receptacle is made of Florentine marble. On Tuesday Louis Magazzu, a town freeholder, held a news conference denouncing the authority's purchases, which also include a dozen executive chairs ($1,752 each), a fancy lectern ($1,232) and 50 wooden stacking chairs ($359 each). He argued that it was out of place for the authority, which is responsible for managing the county dump, to boast such luxurious appointments. 
 ''Whenever you work for a public entity, you need to have a nice public presentation,'' he said, ''but you don't need to make the place look like one of Saddam Hussein's palaces. They literally built this palace on the landfill of Cumberland County.'' Mr. Magazzu added that the spending seemed particularly reckless in light of the fact that Cumberland is one of New Jersey's poorest counties. 
 Steven Wymbs of the improvement authority countered that it had aided the local economy to the tune of $20 million over the last 10 years, largely by maintaining the lowest waste disposal fees in the state. He also argued that the fixtures had been ordered to match the building that houses the authority.
 ''The furniture purchases were dictated by the age and design of the structure,'' Mr. Wymbs said. ''It's a neoclassical structure made of marble and decorative block with brass doors and ornate ironwork.''
 And the ashtray? ''The trash receptacle is designed and made from materials that complement not only the structure it stands in front of, but the ambiance that the city of Millville is trying to portray.'' Jessica Bruder

HEADLINE: Phillies Hope Reality Matches Expectations

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

DATELINE: TAMPA, Fla. 

 BODY:
LARRY BOWA was not manager of the year last season, but credit him with making the most perceptive and realistic comment of the year.
 ''I thought the Mets on paper were going to blow away this division,'' he said about the 2002 Mets in spring training last year. ''Guys have to go out and do it. We can sit here and talk about how good our team is, but until you go out and do it, we're just like everyone else.''
 Bowa was responding to a question about the status of the team he managed, the Philadelphia Phillies, as National League East favorites with the addition of Jim Thome, David Bell and Kevin Millwood. Bowa cited those 2002 Mets as a reason not to get too excited too soon. Despite the addition of Mo Vaughn, Roberto Alomar, Jeromy Burnitz and Roger Cedeno, the Mets finished last instead of first, as expected. 
 Bowa was smart enough not to get excited prematurely, and his wisdom finished ahead of his managing. The Phillies, with all of their promising additions, finished third. Now they have made some more promising moves and again are viewed as a likely division winner. 
 ''Everything on paper looks good,'' he said. ''But you have to go out and do it. You can't talk about it. We haven't done anything yet.''
 This winter the Phillies added Eric Milton to their starting rotation and reconstructed their bullpen with Billy Wagner, one of the league's best closers; Tim Worrell, who was an outstanding substitute for Robb Nen, San Francisco's injured closer; and Roberto Hernandez.
 What happened last year to undermine the Phillies' plans for winning the division championship? Thome, after all, did his part, hitting a league-leading 47 home runs and driving in 131 runs.
 ''We blew 18 saves, and I didn't have a closer the second half,'' Bowa said. ''Polanco missed five weeks, Burrell hit .200 and Bell missed half a season. Those were the four things that happened. They aren't excuses, just reality.''
 The injuries to Bell and Placido Polanco were what Bowa had mentioned, talking about this year's chances, he said, ''Obviously, you have to stay healthy.''
 But the season has not started, and the Phillies are not healthy. Thome and Wagner sustained finger injuries early in spring training, and Bell, who was limited to 85 games last season, hurt his right shoulder during batting practice on Friday.
 Aside from injuries, the Phillies have to avoid performances like that of Pat Burrell, the left fielder, who batted .209 and drove in 64 runs after having knocked in 116 with a .282 batting average the year before.
 ''We hope that last year was just an off year,'' Bowa said. ''He's been down here since the first of February working hard. It's just a matter of him feeling comfortable and getting back that positive attitude.''
 Burrell displayed a gruff attitude when he was asked about his 2003 performance. ''I'm not talking about last year,'' he said.
 But Burrell's performance was an integral part of what Mike Lieberthal, the Phillies' catcher, called ''a definitely disappointing'' season.
 ''We went through that midseason crash where we lost 9 of 10 or 10 of 11, which killed us,'' Lieberthal said. ''And the Marlins beat us up all season. But it still came down to the last week of the season.''
 He was talking about the wild-card race, and the Phillies lost that one, too.
 But Lieberthal, not to mention other members of the Phillies, believes the team is better this year. ''We look stronger on paper,'' he said. ''We'll probably have higher expectations because we'll probably be picked to win the division.'' The Phillies, though, should remember that the Mets did not win the next year, either.

All Around the Horn
 Mike Mussina of the Yankees and David McCarty of the Boston Red Sox were teammates on the Stanford baseball team and classmates in the university's economics department. Both could be major league pitchers.
 Mussina has served in that role for 13 years. McCarty is only getting started.
 ''I think it's something I can do,'' said McCarty, who has been an outfielder-first baseman for six years in the majors. ''Especially with a utility player, it adds a lot of value. It's like having a 26th man. You can pitch a couple innings when the bullpen is beat up or when you need some mop-up duty.''
 McCarty, 34, pitched in high school but not at Stanford, where he was a year behind Mussina. ''We had too many good pitchers there,'' McCarty said.
 He was inspired to try double duty in the majors when Brooks Kieschnick did it for Milwaukee last season. Kieschnick batted .300 in 70 games and compiled a 1-1 record and a 5.26 earned run average in 42 relief appearances for the Brewers.
 ''I talked to him last night,'' McCarty said the other day. ''It was kind of reassuring to see that he went through the same things that I'm going through -- the fatigue, the way you have to budget your time and manage everything, make sure you get ground balls, fly balls, hitting, pitching. There's a lot of work you have to get in in a limited amount of time and certainly energy, too.''
 Last week, the Red Sox decided that double duty was affecting McCarty's first role -- hitting and fielding -- so they cut back his pitching to one game a week with the rest of his work on the side.
 ''We're not abandoning him,'' Manager Terry Francona said. ''We want to work some side days in more and keep him on limited games so physically he can have a chance to do some things in the field a little bit more. Right now it's important for him to play the field, play left field, right field, first base and feel his body. It's very difficult what he's trying to do.''
 McCarty said pitching could detract from his other work ''if the wear and tear is too much.''
 ''That's why we're going to back off the pitching a little bit because my hitting stroke hasn't come around to where it should be at this point,'' he said. ''The wear and tear of trying to keep up with the pitchers and keep up with the hitters is just too much at this point.''
 But McCarty remains optimistic that he can achieve his dual goal.
 ''So far so good,'' he said. ''If nothing else I've shown I can get big-league hitters out. I don't need to be the guy you go to in the seventh or eighth innings to get a big out. That's not what this is about. Just the fact that I can go out and do it is something of value.''

Steroids and the Grassy Knoll
 Maybe they have been on steroids too long, but the conspiracy theorists are in full bloom. Gary Sheffield's thumb injury? Barry Bonds's back ailment?
 If those sluggers have been steroids users in the past, as has been widely speculated, but they do not do their usual amount of slugging this year, suspicious minds posit, they can attribute their decline to their injuries.
 Now about the condition of Jason Giambi's knee that was operated on. . . .

BYLINE: By STUART LAVIETES

 BODY:
Frank Riessman, a social psychologist and founding editor of the journal Social Policy, who stressed the importance of self-help as an agent of social and political change, died in Manhattan on March 1. He was 79.
 He was at a nursing home, suffering from Parkinson's disease and diabetes, at the time of his death, his daughter Robin Riessman said. 
 Dr. Riessman, who during his career was on the faculties of Bard College, New York University, Queens College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, was active in the antipoverty movement of the 1960's. Early in the decade, he worked with Mobilization for Youth, an educational program for minority students. 
 In 1964, he became director of the New Careers Development Center at N.Y.U., which provided job training for the chronically poor, particularly in the human services field. He believed that an expansion of careers in education, social work and health care would help break the cycle of poverty, providing meaningful work for the poor while attacking problems like drug abuse, crime and despair.
 In 1970, Dr. Riessman help create Social Policy, a quarterly journal devoted to participatory reform and to uniting advocates of social change. As editor, he urged the federal government to seek full employment by creating jobs in the human services and environmental conservation fields, contending that new job programs would be less expensive than unemployment benefits.
 In 1976, he founded the National Self-Help Clearinghouse, an educational and research organization dedicated to increasing awareness of the importance of mutual support. In an interview on the organization's Web site, he said that self-help programs -- including everything from Alcoholics Anonymous to Act Up, the protest group concerned with AIDS issues -- are valuable because they encourage members to rely on themselves and their experiences rather than on external help. He also said that members benefit most by providing help to others and that the organizations help democratize the way services are provided.
 Frank Riessman was born in Manhattan on April 9, 1924. He graduated from City College and received his Ph.D. in social psychology from Columbia. Dr. Riessman wrote or edited 16 books, including ''New Careers for the Poor'' (1965); ''Social Class and Social Policy,'' with S. M. Miller (1968); ''Children Teach Children'' (1971); ''The Inner City Child'' (1976); ''The Self-Help Revolution,'' with Alan Gartner (1984); and ''Redefining Self-Help,'' with David Carroll (1995).
 He is survived by his wife, Julia Riessman of Manhattan; three children from his marriage to Catherine Kohler Riessman, which ended in divorce: Robin of Haydenville, Mass.; Janet of Washington; and Jeffrey of Brewster, N.Y.; and two grandchildren.

HEADLINE: If You Can't Say Anything Nice, Run for President

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
THE 2004 presidential campaign has opened with a snarl.
 President Bush and Senator John Kerry, two gentlemen from Yale, wasted no time attacking each other eight months before the election. Last week alone, Mr. Kerry called Republicans ''crooked'' and ''lying'' in off-the-cuff comments, then refused to apologize to what he called a ''Republican attack squad.'' Mr. Bush accused Mr. Kerry of trying to ''gut'' American intelligence services, and he authorized a television ad charging that Mr. Kerry ''would raise taxes by at least $900 billion'' and weaken national defense. Mr. Kerry fired back with an ad asserting that he had never called for such a thing and wanted to cut taxes for the middle class. 
 ''Doesn't America deserve more from its president than misleading negative ads?'' the announcer intoned.
 Probably not, at least if history is any guide. Washington's 2004 political class may be deploring the nasty tone of the fledgling campaign and wondering what awful things Mr. Bush and Mr. Kerry will be saying about each other come October, but historians remain unimpressed. Negative campaigns are American.
 While voters may complain that every campaign seems the most negative ever, contrarians say they serve a useful purpose. In a democracy with a free press and a robust public debate, attacks can be informative and compelling enough to make voters pay attention. 
 Politics have always been a spectator sport in the United States. As at football games, it is not enough to root for your own team. You have to denigrate the other.
 In addition, the country has always been divided by race, region, economics and class, leading to vitriol between the two men representing each side of the divide.
 That said, for all the debate about whether Mr. Bush has diminished himself by going negative so early, the Bush-Kerry matchup has not been particularly negative, at least not yet, by historical standards. More important, their attacks have been about substance that voters can learn from, like national security and taxes. 
 ''People have not begun to sling mud,'' said Walter Russell Mead, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. ''So far it's amateur hour -- no illegitimate children yet.''
 Mr. Mead was referring to the mother of all negative campaigns, the 1884 race between Grover Cleveland and James G. Blaine, a Republican senator from Maine. The race is perhaps best known for the attack line ''Ma! Ma! Where's my Pa?'' which Republicans chanted at Cleveland, who while mayor of Buffalo had an illicit relationship with a widow who bore him a child. Democrats had a response: ''Gone to the White House. Ha! Ha! Ha!''
 Historians say Cleveland probably would have lost had it come out closer to Election Day. As it was, Democrats had time to fight back. They painted Blaine as a corrupt businessman who ended a letter with the instructions, ''burn this.'' But it became public, and Democrats broke into song:
 ''Blaine! Blaine! James G. Blaine!
 The con-ti-nen-tal liar from the state of Maine.''
 One of the nastiest campaigns was one of the first. In the election of 1800, Vice President Thomas Jefferson was tarred as an agent of the French Revolution, while President John Adams was decried as a monarchist; after Jefferson won, his enemies spread the story that he had a slave mistress, Sally Hemings.
 Generally, the campaigns of the 19th century were meaner than the ones today, in large part because the newspapers of the era took sides and were often subsidized by the political parties. ''There was almost no restraint on what could be said in the partisan press,'' said Bruce J. Schulman, a professor of history and American studies at Boston University. ''Party organizations were much stronger, and the partisan attachment of voters was much more loyal. Politics then was not about trying to convert voters based on issues. There were more or less no swing voters. It was all about getting your army of voters to the polls.''
 But the 20th century had its low moments, too, like the 1948 race between Thomas E. Dewey and the incumbent Harry S. Truman. An Oct. 26 headline in The New York Times captures the campaign's tenor: ''President Likens Dewey to Hitler as Fascists' Tool.''
 Truman's victory gave credence to successive generations of political consultants who say negative campaigning, as much as voters malign it, works.
 ''There's generally a very small group of undecided voters, and many of them tend to have murky party loyalties, and they respond to negative advertising,'' said Bill Carrick, a Democratic strategist who advised Representative Richard A. Gephardt before he dropped out of this year's presidential race. ''A lot of times voters are undecided because they're not paying a lot of attention. They're cynical by nature, and they're more likely to believe negative information than positive information.''
 Madison Avenue tends to agree. ''People want something emotional and dramatic,'' said Jerry Della Femina, the adman. ''You can say, 'I'm a nice person' just so many times. After a while you turn and say, 'The other guy's a louse.' People would like to think that they are thoughtful and not swayed by negative advertising, but the fact is, they are. We're verbally aggressive. It's the American way. If it wasn't this way, we wouldn't have hockey.''
 While other countries have negative political races, none are remotely as long as those in the United States, the birthplace of Bill Clinton and the permanent campaign. These marathons, along with modern communications, tend to make the campaigns seem even nastier than they are, particularly to masochists willing to subject themselves to the 24-hour invective available on cable television and the Internet.
 Another factor is the nature of the presidency itself, which gives to a single person the powers of head of government and head of state. ''So he not only has a political function but also a lot of symbolic functions that in other systems is shared out,'' said David M. Kennedy, a professor of history at Stanford. ''The question of presidential character just looms larger because of this symbolic freight we've invested in the president.'' 
 The 19th century notwithstanding, Mr. Kennedy predicted that the 2004 race might be one for the annals of viciousness. ''This could very well be one of the most eye-gouging, nose-biting, no-holds-barred donnybrooks we've seen in a century,'' he said.''
 Historians say that the nation will survive the dirt-shoveling of this election, just as it has the others. ''It's part of the process,'' Mr. Schulman said. ''Oddly enough, the vitriolic and bitter character of American political elections is a sign of just how much agreement on the fundamentals of politics and public life there is. There's never an impending revolution.''

HEADLINE: C.I.A. Says Russia Could Try to Reassert Itself After a Putin Victory

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 13 

 BODY:
The Central Intelligence Agency is warning of a ''greater assertiveness'' on the part of Russia if President Vladimir V. Putin wins re-election as expected on Sunday. 
 A new C.I.A. assessment made public this week says that assertiveness by Russia is likely to be evident both at home and abroad, with its tough stance in the war on Chechnya unlikely to soften and with a more robust approach toward neighboring countries like Georgia and Ukraine backed up by the increasing stakes taken by Russian companies in those countries' energy industries. 
 The assessment says such assertiveness would be backed up by Russia's improving military capacities, but it describes the possible aims as ''limited'' and says Mr. Putin ''has a stake in relative stability on Russia's borders.'' 
 The re-election of Mr. Putin to a second four-year term would be the culmination of a process that has recentralized power in the Kremlin, including a domination of Russian news organizations, according to the new assessment, which was presented on Capitol Hill this week. This ''may bolster trends toward limits on civil society'' and toward state interference in big business, the assessment said. 
 A second assessment, by the Defense Intelligence Agency, also presented to Congress, portrays Russia as ''attempting to reclaim great power status'' under Mr. Putin, in part through increased military activity and defense spending. It said that military exercises conducted by Russian ground forces in 2003 had been at a rate twice that of 2002.
 George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that ''on balance'' Russia's relations with the United States were ''more cooperative than not.'' 
 Still, Mr. Tenet said, ''the coming year will present serious challenges.'' 
 ''For example,'' he added, ''Russia remains supportive of U.S. deployments in Central Asia for Afghanistan -- but is also wary of the U.S. presence in what Russia considers to be its own backyard.'' 
 Mr. Tenet presented the assessment on Russia as part of his annual testimony on worldwide threats facing the United States. Its main focus was on security challenges posed by the insurgency in Iraq, terrorism and the proliferation of illicit weapons, which Mr. Tenet described as the top priorities of the intelligence agencies. 
 But the testimony, presented in a 24-page prepared statement and an extensive question-and-answer session, also touched at length on other concerns. Among them, Mr. Tenet mentioned an accelerating military buildup in China, which he called ''our greatest concern'' in that country; the possibility that Haiti's new interim government ''will have trouble establishing order,'' and the fact that continued violence in Afghanistan would mean ''considerable assistance over the next year or two to stabilize the security environment there.'' 
 On Russia, Mr. Tenet also said recent efforts by the Kremlin to strengthen its role in overseeing the oil sector of the economy ''could discourage investors and hamper energy cooperation with the West.'' 
 The C.I.A. assessment said Mr. Putin, a 51-year-old former spy chief who took power four years ago, had ''brought a sense of stability to the Russian political scene after years of chaos'' and had also ''restored Russians' pride in their country's place in the world.''
 At the same time, Mr. Tenet told Congress that Russia had already become more assertive in its approach to neighboring states of the former Soviet Union. He said Russian companies, in a move consistent with the Kremlin's agenda, were increasing their stakes in those countries, particularly in energy industries.
 ''Russia is using primarily economic incentives and levers of 'soft' power, like shared history and culture, to rebuild lost power and influence,'' the assessment said. 
 It also said the stability on Russia's borders was important ''not least to maintain positive relations with the U.S. and Europeans.''

HEADLINE: The Politics Of Self-Pity

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD. 
E-mail: liberties@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Republicans relished their philosophy of personal responsibility last week with John Belushi's famous mantra: Cheeseburgercheeseburgercheeseburger.
 When the House passed the ''cheeseburger bill'' to bar people from suing fast food joints for making them obese, Republican backers of the legislation scolded Americans, saying the fault lies not in their fries, but in themselves.
 ''Look in the mirror, because you're the one to blame,'' said F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. of Wisconsin, home of brats and beer bellies.
 So it comes as something of a disappointment that the leader of the Republican Party, the man who epitomizes the conservative ideal, is playing the victim. President Bush has made the theme of his re-election campaign a whiny ''not my fault.'' 
 His ads, pilloried for the crass use of the images of a flag-draped body carried from ground zero and an Arab-looking everyman with the message, ''We can fight against terrorists,'' actually have a more fundamental problem. They try to push off blame for anything that's gone wrong during Mr. Bush's tenure on bigger forces, supposedly beyond his control.
 One ad cites ''an economy in recession. A stock market in decline. A dot-com boom gone bust. Then a day of tragedy. A test for all Americans.''
 Mr. Bush's subtext is clear: If it weren't for all these awful things that happened, most of them hangovers from the Clinton era, I definitely could have fulfilled all my promises. I'm still great, but none of my programs worked because, well, stuff happens.''
 It's as if his inner fat boy is complaining that a classic triple cheeseburger from Wendy's (940 calories and 56 grams of fat, 25 of them saturated, and 2,140 milligrams of sodium) jumped out of its wrapper and forced its way down his unwilling throat, topped off by a pushy Frosty (540 calories and 13 grams of fat, 8 of them saturated).
 Mr. Bush has been in office over three years. It's time to start accepting some responsibility.
 Republicans have a bad habit of laying down rules for other people to follow while excluding themselves. Look how they beat up Bill Clinton for messing around with a young woman, while many top Republicans were doing the very same thing.
 Mr. Bush's whingeing was infectious. The very House Republicans who greased the skids for the cheeseburger bill got in a huff over John Kerry's overheard comment to some supporters in Chicago that his Republican critics were ''the most crooked, you know, lying group'' he'd ever seen.
 These tough-guy Republicans, who rule the House with an iron fist, were suddenly squealing like schoolgirls at being victimized by big, bad John Kerry. J. Dennis Hastert, the House speaker, said Mr. Kerry would have his ''upcomeance coming.'' Tom DeLay sulked that the public was getting ''a glimpse of the real John Kerry.'' The Hammer was talking like a nail. 
 Marc Racicot, Mr. Bush's campaign chairman, accused Mr. Kerry of ''unbecoming'' conduct and called on him to apologize.
 Oh, the poor dears. The very Bush crowd that savaged John McCain in South Carolina, that bullied and antagonized the allies we need in the real war on terror, that is spending a hundred million dollars on ads that will turn Mr. Kerry into something akin to the Boston Strangler; these guys are suddenly such delicate flowers, such big bawling babies, that they can't bear to hear Mr. Kerry speak of them harshly.
 Mr. Bush is not believable in the victim's role. He and Dick Cheney have audaciously imposed their will on Washington and the world. 
 We are not yet sure who is behind the horrendous bombings in Spain, but they have already underscored how vulnerable our trains and subways are. And they have reminded us that the administration diverted resources from the war on terror and the search for Osama to settle old scores in Iraq, building a case for war with hyped and phony claims on weapons.
 In an interview with The Guardian, the weapons sleuth David Kay said it's time for Mr. Bush to take personal responsibility: ''It's about confronting and coming clean with the American people. . . . He should say: 'We were mistaken and I am determined to find out why.' ''
 In other words, Mr. Bush, look in the mirror.

HEADLINE: Prosecutors Send a Message. Are Executives Listening?

BYLINE: By JONATHAN D. GLATER

 BODY:
THE case would ''send an important message that we will not, and frankly, cannot tolerate dishonesty and corruption.'' 
 So said David N. Kelley, the United States attorney in Manhattan, after the Martha Stewart verdict, echoing similar statements from prosecutors and regulators about the current wave of white-collar trials. 
 But do high-profile prosecutions, like those now under way against Enron and Adelphia executives, among others, actually discourage people from considering criminal acts? The large number of corporate trials over the last two years may be putting that notion of deterrence itself on trial. 
 Dan Kahan, a professor at Yale Law School, said the value of white-collar prosecutions was extremely difficult to measure. Punishment may make an impact but not if, say, the culture inside a brokerage house encourages employees to believe it's O.K., even if illegal, to trade on inside tips. 
 On the other hand, executives are often well-informed about the law and have a lot to lose if they are caught committing a crime, said Mary Jo White, the former United States attorney in Manhattan and now a lawyer in private practice. 
 ''You have a very attentive audience that pays attention to what gets prosecuted,'' Ms. White said. ''I think you as a prosecutor can accomplish a lot of deterrence in the white-collar arena.''
 But if executives think they are unlikely to be caught, they will not be deterred, said Jonathan Simon, a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley. The lesson of watching prominent executives like Martha Stewart on trial may only be: Don't break the rules if you're famous, because celebrity draws prosecutors' interest.
 ''Certainty is a much more important aspect than severity,'' Mr. Simon said, arguing for more oversight and run-of-the-mill prosecutions, rather than the occasional high-profile trial. 
 Splashy white-collar trials were also held in the late 1980's -- including those of Ivan F. Boesky and Michael Milken. But, as David Callahan, author of ''The Cheating Culture: Why More Americans Are Doing Wrong to Get Ahead,'' observed, by the late 1990's corporate crime was once again seen as corrosive, with widespread economic and social effects.
 No one knows whether today's trials will give pause to tomorrow's would-be white-collar criminals. ''We don't know what's going to happen with Skilling, we don't know if Frank Quattrone's going to be convicted the next time around,'' Mr. Callahan said, referring to the former Enron chief executive Jeffrey K. Skilling, who faces a criminal indictment, and Mr. Quattrone, the former Credit Suisse First Boston banker whose trial last fall on obstruction-of-justice charges ended in a hung jury. Both men have pleaded not guilty to the charges against them. 
 Simply being accused of a crime includes a social stigma. Mr. Kahan notes, however, that executives may not believe that what they did was wrong. 
 ''What is shameful is constructed by all kinds of interactions you have with others,'' Mr. Kahan said. Some executives may not see the shame in their actions until they find themselves in the glare of criminal proceedings and media attention. In other words, if executives think that only losers follow the rules, they will keep breaking them even if they know it is wrong. 
 ''Most people will want to do the right thing, but most people do not want to be treated like a chump,'' Mr. Kahan said. ''Which of those sensibilities dominates will depend on their perception of whether other people in similar situations'' are doing the right thing -- or, if they do the wrong thing, whether they pay a price. 
 That's why individual prosecutions need to be part of a broader enforcement system, said Ms. White, the former United States attorney. ''You need a more comprehensive mechanism of sending the message, making it easier for people to comply.''
 But even if people have heard such a message from current prosecutions and new regulations, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who as United States attorney in the 1980's led the Boesky and Milken prosecutions, suggested that the effect may fade over time. He likened the current cases to being caught for speeding. 
 ''People get a speeding ticket, and then most people don't speed for a while,'' he said. The real question, he added, is for how long.

HEADLINE: Kerry Asks Bush for Monthly Debates Until Election Day

BYLINE: By JODI WILGOREN

DATELINE: QUINCY, Ill., March 13 

 BODY:
Senator John Kerry came here to the site of one of the legendary Lincoln-Douglas debates on Saturday to repeat his call for President Bush to engage him in monthly one-on-ones from now until Election Day, saying, ''Americans shouldn't have to put up with eight months of sniping.''
 ''We confront big issues -- as big as any issues in the history of our nation -- and they call for a new and historic commitment to a real and informed exchange of ideas,'' said Mr. Kerry, the four-term Massachusetts Democrat who has all but locked up his party's presidential nomination. ''I believe the American people are hungry for a genuine conversation about the fundamental questions before us, and they are ready to begin this now.'' 
 The challenge came at the close of a week in which Mr. Kerry and Mr. Bush traded tit-for-tat attacks. Mr. Bush began a $6 million television advertising campaign in which he portrays Mr. Kerry as soft on defense and intending to raise taxes $900 billion in his first 100 days in office; Mr. Kerry countered with $1.8 million in advertising saying, ''Once again, George Bush is misleading America.''
 In his speech here, where Abraham Lincoln and Stephen A. Douglas met in the sixth of seven debates in their 1858 Senate campaign, Mr. Kerry declared: ''Surely, if the attack ads can start now, at least we can agree to start a real discussion about America's future.''
 Steve Schmidt, a Bush campaign spokesman, said Mr. Kerry had run 17 negative spots -- a total of 15,000 times -- and spent $6.3 million attacking the president in the primaries. He also noted that Mr. Kerry called his Republican rivals ''the most crooked, you know, lying group I've ever seen'' last week.
 ''Senator Kerry should finish the debate with himself before he starts trying to explain his positions to the voters,'' said Mr. Schmidt, who frequently describes Mr. Kerry as a flip-flopper on issues.
 The Commission on Presidential Debates has scheduled three presidential debates in the fall, the same number that took place in 2000.
 In his weekly radio address on Saturday, the president did not mention Mr. Kerry, instead using the phrase ''some politicians in Washington.'' 
 ''They want to increase federal taxes, yet punishing families and small businesses isn't a job-creation strategy,'' Mr. Bush said. ''They want to build up trade walls, and isolate America from the rest of the world, but economic isolationism would threaten the millions of good American jobs that depend on exports.''
 Mr. Kerry's challenge came as he inched toward the nomination by winning the caucuses on Saturday in Kansas, where 33 delegates were at stake.
 Also on Saturday, Mr. Kerry installed his campaign's finance director, Peter Maroney, at the Democratic National Committee. As the party's national finance co-chairman, Mr. Maroney can collect up to $25,000 per donor, well above the $2,000 limit for donors to candidates.
 In Quincy, Mr. Kerry marveled at how in 1858, when the population was 10,000, as many as twice that number came to hear Lincoln and Douglas.
 The population is now about 43,000, some of whom waved from the sidewalk or the picture windows of their stately 19th-century homes as Mr. Kerry's motorcade drove along Maine Street. But only a few hundred made it to the half-empty junior high school gym where Mr. Kerry spoke before a brief stop for the cameras at the debate site.
 Beyond the legacy of Lincoln -- another tall, thin politician whose craggy face is often compared with Mr. Kerry's -- the senator invoked his own campaign experience in 1996, when he and Gov. William F. Weld held eight debates across Massachusetts. Those debates are credited with helping Mr. Kerry win after he had fallen behind Mr. Weld in polls.
 ''When I first decided to do it, I wondered if voters could actually withstand and endure the cruel and unusual punishment of having to listen to two politicians for that long,'' Mr. Kerry said. But, he added, ''by the time voters went to the polls, everyone knew where we stood and what we would do.''

HEADLINE: He's Firing As Fast As He Can

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
THE night before the jury elected to send Martha Stewart to the slammer, some 20 million Americans watched with glee as another businesswoman got her comeuppance. On ''The Apprentice,'' Donald Trump fired Omarosa Manigault-Stallworth, the contestant audiences loved to hate in NBC's hit reality show pitting 16 aspiring Trumps in a dog-eat-dog weekly battle to win a $250,000-a-year job in his employ. The ritualistic weekly firing on ''The Apprentice'' is an instant TV classic -- right up there with Rod Serling beckoning us into the Twilight Zone. Mr. Trump seems to grab a gnat out of the air with his fingers as he focuses on his prey, and then, wham, it comes: ''You're fired!'' We just can't get enough of hearing Mr. Trump say, ''You're fired!'' Even the network promos featuring the bit are music to a nation's ears.
 For many, the joint Omarosa-Martha beheading was a double feature of schadenfreude, with a soupcon of synergy: A Kmart commercial during ''The Apprentice'' showcased Ms. Stewart's housewares. Both women have been frequently slapped with the b word by detractors, who despise in them the aggressive, self-absorbed and haughty behavior that is routinely countenanced in male masters of the universe. 
 But to view the animosity toward these two strictly as a parable about gender -- or to see the Stewart verdict as a morality tale about the price of celebrity or the wages of lying -- is to miss much of the picture.
 The general joy attending both Ms. Stewart's demise and Mr. Trump's weekly dismissals is the most telling cultural indicator yet that the revulsion against business remains red-hot more than two years after the bubble burst. Writing about the Stewart trial in Slate, Henry Blodget described the prevailing mood: ''The bloodthirsty political environment that spawned this indictment was, in its own way, as rabid, crazy and ephemeral as the boom that preceded it.'' Mr. Blodget -- the disgraced former Merrill Lynch tech analyst who made his name by hyping junk stocks during the boom -- knows the horror whereof he speaks.
 Not even 9/11, or the rumors of an economic recovery, have dented Americans' anger. If anything, the rage may be coming to a new boil in an election year when jobs have failed to materialize as promised, and when the embattled incumbent's No. 1 career patron is Enron, the totemic corporate fraud of our age. This corrosive atmosphere is no doubt what moved Chappell Hartridge, the juror in the Stewart case most enthralled by his own 15 minutes of fame, to grandstand that the verdict was ''a victory for the little guys who lose money in the market because of these kinds of transactions.'' In reality, it was no such victory for the little guy; Ms. Stewart wasn't charged with insider trading, and she was the sole victim of her crime, a minuscule transaction next to the $11 billion alleged fraud at WorldCom.
 But when there's a bloodthirstiness at loose in the land, such details don't matter. We'll string up whoever is handy. Though not even Michael Eisner's harshest critics have accused him of breaking the law, his downfall has also become a bloody spectator sport, including for those who don't know Disney's share price and are foggy on his record as a manager. The company's shareholders' meeting in Philadelphia received the media attention of a playoff game, and, for connoisseurs of subtle forms of torture, there was the postgame Ted Koppel interview with Mr. Eisner that night. ''Nightline'' had almost been killed by Disney's back-door effort to recruit David Letterman for ABC two years ago, and Mr. Koppel was clearly in no mood to forgive and forget. In sly sotto voce, he took sadistic delight in rubbing Mr. Eisner's face in the breaking news of his dethronement as Disney board chairman. It was a ''you're fired!'' denouement in all but name.
 At a time when even the most admired C.E.O. of the 1990's, Jack Welch, has been tarnished by revelations of expense account greed, there's an opening for king of the corporate hill. Surely it's an unexpected development that that role would be filled in the popular culture by Donald Trump. In 2004, a man who was the often mocked hood ornament of the ''greed is good'' boom of the late 1980's has been rehabilitated both as a show biz phenomenon (NBC sees ''The Apprentice'' as its Thursday night successor to ''Friends'') and, more intriguingly, as a moral paragon. It's not an indication of how much he has changed, which is not at all (with the possible exception of that hair), but how much the country around him has.
 Now, as ever, Mr. Trump is a real estate developer who wallows in glitz, congratulates himself over the art of his own deals and cares little about who is displaced or whose view is blocked by his slabs of phallic architecture. But his business, unlike that of the Skillings and Waksals, is far from exotic. He wants, he buys, he builds, he slaps his name on everything in sight. His is the second-oldest profession in the world.
 That familiarity is comforting. So is the realization that on ''The Apprentice,'' we never see Mr. Trump using a computer or a P.D.A.; even his secretary uses an old-fashioned, card-filled Rolodex. The tasks he sets for the contestants are just as retro. In the first episode, he instructed them to sell lemonade. In the episode in which he fired Omarosa, the assignment was to sell art. The team that won was congratulated by Mr. Trump for really believing in the product it was selling -- a corny idea harking back to the low-tech heyday of the Fuller Brush Man. The paintings that were sold, however hideous they might have been, were, if nothing else, tangible merchandise, a far cry from the phantom slices of Internet bandwidth Enron claimed to be trading on its way to oblivion. 
 Experts from the business world have been merciless in ridiculing the show. ''Many C.E.O.'s I talk with shudder at this ill-timed portrait of corporate leadership just when we need to restore trust in corporate values,'' said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, associate dean at the Yale School of Management, who has been recruited for a weekly USA Today panel of experts that dissects every episode as if it were ''Finnegans Wake.'' What's lost on him and so many others is that Mr. Trump's brand of leadership, narcissistic and autocratic as it seems, strikes audiences as more palatable than the corporate shenanigans that have been in the spotlight on the public stage in recent years.
 In ''The Apprentice,'' the disgraced values of the Blodget-era boom are usually embodied by the contestants, and it is they, not Mr. Trump, who are unsympathetic. We don't root for them to win -- we root for them to be canned. Revealingly enough, the most popular Trump firing before Omarosa was that of Sam Solovey, who was identified as the founder of some sort of vague Internet company and seemed a caricature of dotcom-era arrogance. By contrast, the most appealing contestant is easily the least digital and most Trump-like of the lot, Troy McClain, a scantly educated insurance man from Boise.
 Of course we cannot have a business economy run solely by insurance agents and real estate developers, but in its caricatured way, ''The Apprentice'' has captured the fallout of the bust. It's not that Americans despise people for getting rich. No one faults the show's contestants for wanting to have, as one line has it, ''a taste of the Trump lifestyle.'' People resent that lifestyle -- or Martha Stewart's -- only when it is linked to cheating. If you want to throw a toga party in Sardinia with an ice statue of Michelangelo's ''David'' urinating vodka (as Tyco's Dennis Kozlowski did) or own 100 pairs of identical slippers (Adelphia's Timothy Rigas) or have a 118-foot yacht named Aquasition (WorldCom's Bernie Ebbers), that's your God-given, all-American right, as long as you don't rob anyone. 
 Though Mr. Trump may have the same taste, ego and fortune as a Kozlowski, he's a hero because he conducts business so transparently (as idealized on TV, at least). That's why the anti-corporate mood of 2004 is not to be confused with class warfare, a European concept Americans rarely embrace. As a political matter, class warfare can't fly in the presidential race anyway, given that both George W. Bush and John Kerry are multimillionaires from the same upper class. But if class is not an issue, the misbehavior of those on top remains a hot button.
 Mr. Kerry, who has spent his entire career in politics, is free to rush into this fray and bad-mouth ''Benedict Arnold C.E.O.'s,'' as he calls them, because there is no business experience on his resume. (His critique may not extend to Martha Stewart, a Democratic contributor, however.) Mr. Bush, whose youthful bailouts at Harken Oil are as cloudy in particulars as his National Guard service, is not so easily inoculated. He can read the polls. Some 64 percent of Americans judge the president to be more aligned with business than with ''the average person'' -- an alignment that's none too popular, given that The Wall Street Journal reported last month that a whopping 75 percent of Americans found the image of big corporations to be ''not good'' or ''terrible.'' Not even the news media are so despised, which is saying something.
 The president, who entered office priding himself on his entrepreneurial know-how and on the high quotient of C.E.O.'s in his can-do administration, has thus begun a campaign to distance himself from his own bedrock constituency. In his first campaign ads, there is no depiction of the most famous business executive in his administration, Dick Cheney; in place of his face is that of Laura Bush, a surrogate running mate. It's probably not a good thing that Mr. Cheney does appear, if only by inference, in some other ads, an image-burnishing campaign from his former employer, Halliburton. The commercials accompany happy scenes from Iraq with the sell line: ''We're serving the troops because of what we know, not who we know.''
 If the president's re-election campaign is lucky, those embarrassing commercials will soon disappear, and the vice president, like the mysteriously vanished Ken Lay, will remain out of sight through Election Day. Any incumbent politician who calls attention to his corporate past this year is all but inviting voters to pull the lever that says, ''You're fired!''

HEADLINE: Bold Thai Leader Faces Growing Criticism

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: BANGKOK 

 BODY:
In a country where people pride themselves on tranquillity and deference, Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra of Thailand shows little of either trait. 
 Mr. Thaksin, a former policeman who got rich in the telecommunications business, is out front and boastful, asserting that Thailand can serve as the leader of a newly vibrant Southeast Asia. He is the region's modern man, he says. 
 But complaints about an increasingly authoritarian style and perceptions that his government's decisions benefit his family's financial interests have taken the sheen off the region's rising star. 
 His most immediate political problems center on unrest in the Muslim-dominated south and anger over his government's failure to warn about the outbreak of Asian bird flu even though officials knew the disease was at hand. 
 In the capital, intellectuals refer to Mr. Thaksin as the Berlusconi of Asia, a reference to Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy, a business tycoon who has faced continuing accusations of conflict of interest.
 Mr. Thaksin ran his corporation as a one-man show, and he runs the country the same way, his critics assert. He has tightened his grip on television, radio and the newspapers -- leaving few news outlets free of political influence. 
 ''He doesn't have a democratic instinct,'' said Ammar Siamalla, one of the country's leading economists.
 Asked by Thai reporters about the growing criticism, Mr. Thaksin responded, ''Decisiveness isn't dictatorship.'' Anyway, he said, his wife, Pojamarn, a general's daughter and businesswoman, always keeps him in check. ''The Thais have my wife as a warning machine,'' he said. 
 The United States added to the criticism recently, saying in its annual human rights report that the Thaksin government had killed many civilians during its crackdown on drug trafficking last year. 
 In response, Mr. Thaksin called the United States a ''useless friend,'' perhaps implying that Washington should be more grateful for Thailand's contribution of nearly 500 troops in Iraq. 
 In many respects, Mr. Thaksin, 54, who has a degree in criminal justice from Sam Houston State University in Texas and recently wore a watermelon pink shirt to a cabinet meeting, has delivered on his promises. 
 Thailand's economy was one of the standouts in Asia last year, growing by more than 6 percent. With steady demand from China for electronic parts, petrochemicals and rubber, Thailand can expect even higher growth this year, said Supavud Saicheun, chief of research at Phatra Securities. 
 In a major face-lift for the country, Mr. Thaksin is pushing ahead on plans for Heaven City, a satellite city intended as a smog-free alternative to the traffic-choked capital. He says he will replace the worn-out international airport, and he wants to upgrade the railways. He has challenged the Thai auto industry to become the Detroit of the region, and he has urged Thailand's little-known fashion designers to elevate Bangkok to become the Paris of the East. 
 Along with the increased public spending, he has encouraged easy credit for corporations and consumers. He has provided the nation's 70,000 villages with a system of microcredits and introduced almost free health care at hospitals. 
 These programs have increased his popularity: he is regarded as the first Thai prime minister to act on behalf of the poor. But the programs have not worked smoothly. 
 Villagers in Mr. Thaksin's home area around the northern city of Chiang Mai say many poor people have run up large debts because they have little understanding of the obligations of borrowing. 
 Tong Taan Wong, 66, a shopkeeper, said he resigned from his village's loan committee because he did not want to be involved in the unpopular cause of debt collection. Tang-on Ong-sun Torn, 28, said her husband bought 18 bicycles for a rental business but found few customers. He gave up the business and still had a big loan to pay back, she said.
 In the capital, nepotism is a major concern. The prime minister's cousin, Gen. Chaiyasit Shinawatra, is now commander in chief of the army. One of Mr. Thaksin's sisters, Yaowapha Wongsawat, heads a faction within the governing Thai Rak Thai Party. Another sister, Yaovares Shinawatra, is the leader of the National Council of Women. 
 Somkiat Tangkitvanich, an economist and a research director at the Thailand Development Research Institute, recently completed a study of how political connections affected Thai businesses. 
 His analysis showed that companies on the Bangkok stock exchange in which the Shin Corporation, the Thaksin family's company, owned significant holdings, did spectacularly better in 2003 than other listed companies, including those whose major shareholders included families of cabinet members. 
 Further, Mr. Somkiat said, a government decree effectively barred the liberalization of the Thai telecommunications industry, which is dominated by the Thaksin family company. The decree added an excise tax on new telecommunication companies. 
 In another decision, Mr. Somkiat said, a government board provided a corporate income tax exemption for eight years on revenue generated overseas from new communications satellites. The Shin Corporation is about to launch its fourth satellite, he said. 
 Since Mr. Thaksin took office, the press has come under intense pressure from the government. The editor of an influential English-language daily, The Bangkok Post, Veera Pratheepchaikul, was removed last month after the newspaper ran articles critical of Mr. Thaksin. Other journalists and editors have been dismissed. The family of a cabinet member has become a major stockholder of a second English-language daily, The Nation. 
 Asked about the assertion that the government policies favored the prime minister's family interests, Mr. Thaksin's spokesman, Jakrapob Penkair, said: ''The prime minister wants the economy to be better off because then everyone benefits. He compares the economy to a container. When it rains, a big container collects more water, a small container less.'' 
 Giving a rendition of trickle-down economics, Mr. Jakrapob said those who had a big container in the economy -- the wealthy -- received ''more reward'' but those with a small container also benefited. 
 Mr. Somkiat, who studied the administration, said, ''I'd say Thaksin has the only container.''

HEADLINE: China's Economic Engine Needs Power (Lots of It)

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
FOR all the hoopla about China's booming economy, its manufacturing muscle and its potential to become a great power, the world's most populous country is struggling to keep the lights on. And the sporadic blackouts that plagued much of China last year are raising complicated questions for the Communist Party and for the rest of the world:
 How and where will China get the energy it needs to maintain its economic growth? And how much will the environment suffer for it?
 ''It's one of the hottest issues facing the international energy industry,'' said Scott Roberts, chief representative in the Beijing office of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a consulting firm based in Massachusetts. ''The growth has been explosive, and I think it has caught many people in China and elsewhere off guard.'' 
 China's emergence has already roiled commodities markets, as the country has become a voracious consumer of energy and raw materials. Last year, its oil imports rose by nearly a third. It also built so many new cars, factories, airports and high-rises that it passed the United States to become the world's biggest steel importer, according to the Iron and Steel Statistics Bureau, a British-based information clearinghouse for the steel industry. Last year, China accounted for almost a third of the world's consumption of finished steel.
 Electricity consumption jumped by 15 percent. Domestic coal production rose by 100 million tons -- and still there were shortages.
 Yet China's appetite today is modest compared with what is estimated for the future; the country's energy needs are expected to more than double by 2020. This prospect has the Communist Party reportedly rolling out plans for at least 100 new power plants, including nuclear, hydropower and coal-fired ones. It has also raised concerns that efforts to improve China's polluted environment will be muted by the demand for power.
 China is trying just about every possible avenue to satisfy its power demands, and none offers a completely risk-free or ''clean'' solution. Plans call for at least 20 nuclear plants to be built by 2020. Hydropower projects, regarded by many Chinese officials as a clean power source, are threatening to disrupt the ecological balance on many important rivers that flow out of the high Tibetan plateau.
 China's primary energy source, and its dirtiest, is coal, which accounts for almost 70 percent of the power supply. Coal is a primary source of greenhouse gases, and experts predict that by 2020 China could pass the United States to become the world's biggest source of carbon monoxide. That this is happening is perhaps not surprising, because America is an economic, if not political, model for China.
 ''The fundamental problem is that China is following the path of the United States, and probably the world cannot afford a second United States,'' said Zhang Jianyu, program manager for the Beijing office of Environmental Defense, an American-based advocacy group.
 In an address earlier this month before the annual meeting of the National People's Congress, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao captured the competing pressures of the economy when he cited environmental protection and called for building a ''conservation-minded society.'' Yet he also exhorted the country to develop more energy sources. 
 ''We must speed up the development of large coal mines, important power generating facilities and power grids, the exploration and exploitation of petroleum and other important resources,'' he said.
 Michelle Billig, a former energy attache in the United States Embassy in Beijing, said China's leaders are improving energy efficiency and becoming more environmentally friendly. She noted that China is completing the creation of fuel-efficiency standards that are better than those in the United States. The government is also experimenting with buses and taxis that run on natural gas and expanding its use of ''clean'' coal technology.
 ''In some ways, they are addressing these issues a lot more seriously than we are in the United States,'' said Ms. Billig, now an international affairs fellow with the Council on Foreign Relations.
 But experts agree that such efforts, as yet, are making only a tiny difference and that too often environmental restraints are brushed aside to meet the demand for power. Mr. Zhang said China's environmental degradation is already being measured in economic losses. He said state officials estimate that acid rain causes about $13 billion, while air pollution reduces the annual gross domestic product by about 3 percent.
 China is also often inefficient in its energy use. Mr. Roberts, the Cambridge Energy consultant, said that the worst Chinese industries waste 70 percent more energy than their counterparts in the United States. He also noted that China's electricity consumption grew by 15 percent last year and 10.4 percent in 2002 -- a spike in demand he said was equal to total power consumption in Brazil. ''They are adding a middle-sized country every two years in terms of energy consumption,'' he said.
 This helps explain why energy security is an increasingly important issue for Chinese leaders, particularly regarding oil. China began importing oil in the early 1990's, partly because its own supplies were leveling out, but also because of rising demand. Now the American invasion of Iraq has shown Chinese leaders, dependent on Middle East oil, how vulnerable they could become.
 A December 2003 analysis of China's energy situation by Deutsche Bank noted that in response to the Iraq war, China has begun building a group of storage facilities to create a strategic oil reserve. The report also noted that the country is aggressively pursuing oil deals around the world, from neighboring Kazakhstan and Russia to other oil fields in South America and even Canada. Earlier this year, President Hu Jintao made visits to African countries with significant oil fields.
 For now, power officials are warning citizens that another spate of blackouts is likely. Last year, nearly two-thirds of the provinces and autonomous regions experienced varying degrees of blackouts. This year, officials say, could be as bad, or maybe worse.


CORRECTION-DATE: March 21, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about China's energy needs misidentified the main greenhouse gas emitted by burning coal. It is carbon dioxide, not carbon monoxide.

HEADLINE: A Tale of Two Indias (and Americas)

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 As an Indian, born here in America, I have loved reading the many words of praise offered by Thomas L. Friedman in his most recent columns (including ''The Great Indian Dream,'' March 11). He has shared some great tales of a country that many people are only just beginning to know because of the free and increasingly global market.
 That India is no longer simply synonymous with images of poverty is a tremendous step forward, but I worry that these images will be completely eclipsed by those of call centers in Bangalore and the rising economic freedom of those fortunate enough to be involved. The pictures of sadness are too easily forgotten unless you have seen the children who are hungry and sick. 
 The vast majority of the overwhelming population still lives with too little, and so I urge Mr. Friedman and others to keep painting those pictures as well.

Kerry Missing Late-Night Peg
 THE Bush campaign went on television last week with commercials labeling Senator John Kerry, but the nation's late-night comedians still haven't quite pegged him. They haven't completed the ritual of turning a presidential candidate into a stock character like Bush the Dumb Frat Boy, Gore the Know-It-All Stiff, Clinton the Gluttonous Lecher or Reagan the Amiable Dunce.
 Comedians have tried the Rich Guy persona along with a variation of the Gold Digger, which Jay Leno used in explaining how Mr. Kerry would eliminate the federal deficit: ''He said all we have to do is find a really rich country like Switzerland and marry it.'' They've also tried the War Bore, as depicted in jokes about Mr. Kerry's frequent references to his Vietnam service. There's also Kerry the Waffler on issues, as in David Letterman's line: ''I'm telling you, this guy has more positions than Paris Hilton.'' 
 The most popular persona so far seems to be Killjoy Kerry, as depicted in the many jokes about his long face and dour demeanor. After Mr. Kerry's victory speech on Super Tuesday, Craig Kilborn said, ''Democrats finally found someone who is Al Gore without the flash and the sizzle.'' Colin Quinn calls him the Undertaker and imagines him posing with a wife and pitchfork. 
 ''We're just starting to get a bead on Kerry,'' said Mr. Quinn, the host of ''Tough Crowd,'' a daily comedians' roundtable on Comedy Central. ''He should eventually be an improvement on Bush, who's getting played out, but right now Kerry is not a real lively one. We need more information on him. People are waiting for something funny to happen, like the choking-on-a-pretzel thing.''

Great Attack Ad: Priceless
 WHEN you're making political advertisements, it turns out there are some things money needn't buy.
 A federal judge in New York ruled Monday that it's all right to freely borrow Mastercard International's ''priceless'' advertising format when you're using it to sell a politician. Mastercard International sued to stop Ralph Nader from running a commercial four years ago that promoted his presidential bid by listing other politicians' campaign expenses (like ''Grilled tenderloin for fund-raiser: $1,000 a plate'') followed by ''Finding out the truth: priceless.''
 But on Monday, the suit was finally dismissed by Judge George B. Daniels, who ruled that the political advertisement was a parody that did not infringe on Mastercard's trademark and copyright. 
 The immediate beneficiary of the ruling seems to be Citizens United, a conservative group that borrowed the format in a commercial last week listing the prices of Mr. Kerry's possessions (like ''Designer shirts: $250'') followed by ''Another rich, liberal elitist from Massachusetts who claims he's a man of the people: priceless.''

Political Quiz On the Economy
 AS Democrats were attacking him last month, some Republicans demanded the resignation of N. Gregory Mankiw, the chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, because of his remarks about outsourcing jobs. On Tuesday, at a hearing on Capitol Hill, the topic was revisited by Robert B. Zoellick, the administration's trade representative. But this time, no one demanded his head, even though he spent much of his time offering the same sort of conventional economic wisdom on the benefits of free trade.
 What was the difference? To test your political antenna, try to pick out Mr. Mankiw's two perceived gaffes as well as two of Mr. Zoellick's nonnewsworthy comments among these statements:
 a) When a good or service is produced at lower cost in another country, it makes sense to import it rather than to produce it domestically. 
 b) It's clear economic isolationism won't work. I think one has to be very careful about bureaucratic interventions that will increase prices for people.
 c) Americans, given the dynamism in this economy, can be big beneficiaries of openness and global growth and development.
 d) I think outsourcing is a growing phenomenon, but it's something that we should realize is probably a plus for the economy in the long run.
 e) Frankly, some of these workers in India need the jobs more than Americans do -- and they have better telephone manners.
 Answers: Mr. Mankiw got in trouble for a and d. Mr. Zoellick skated by with b and c. If you picked e, do not consider a career in politics.

HEADLINE: If It Isn't One Nuisance . . .

BYLINE: By HUBERT B. HERRING

 BODY:
Well, one down, one to go. The ''do not call'' list is proving a ringing -- no, make that a nonringing -- success. 
Those pesky sales calls -- timed by a fearfully omniscient computer to intrude at the exact moment you settle in for dinner -- are declining rapidly, according to an Associated Press/Ipsos survey of 1,000 Americans in February.
 But only fools would suppose they could stop commerce from intruding in their lives, and sure enough, e-mail spam has gushed in where telemarketers were warned not to tread. And gushed and gushed, to the point where you take a deep breath and arm yourself with strong coffee before clicking on the daily avalanche of dozens of messages. Yes, there's a law that's supposed to limit it, but the survey shows that it doesn't seem to be working. HUBERT B. HERRING

HEADLINE: G.M. Is Extending the Warranty On Variable Saturn Transmission

BYLINE: By CHERYL JENSEN

 BODY:
BECAUSE of concerns about the durability of Saturn's continuously variable transmissions, General Motors is extending the warranty.
 The extension applies to 2002-04 models, as well as to future models that will use the same transmission. The warranty will be stretched to 5 years or 75,000 miles from the original term of 3 years or 36,000 miles, a G.M. spokeswoman, Debbie Frakes, said late last week. Only two G.M. vehicles sold in the United States, the Saturn Vue and Ion, currently use the transmission. 
 Ms. Frakes said the company was acting because of concern about the durability of the steel belt at the heart of the transmission, which G.M. calls the VTi.
 C.V.T.'s generally change gears through the use of a belt or chain that runs through pulleys that move closer together or farther apart. Instead of a fixed number of gear ratios, like those of a conventional transmission -- whose shifts the driver can feel as they occur -- a C.V.T. has an infinite number of gear ratios that change constantly. The shifts are smooth and seamless, at least in theory.
 Because a C.V.T. more closely matches the engine's output to the vehicle's speed, the engine should always be operating at optimum efficiency, improving fuel economy.
 G.M. halted production of the transmissions on Jan. 6 at the Fiat G.M. Powertrain plant in Hungary, and simultaneously stopped building Vues and Ions with the transmissions at the Saturn assembly plant in Spring Hill, Tenn.
 The issue that stopped production was concern over belt durability that might affect a small percent of vehicles, Ms. Frakes said.
 ''In the field, we have seen very limited instances of belt failure, but we don't know if the causes of those belt failures are related to the condition we discovered in the tests,'' she said, referring to the company's own high-speed testing.
 Ions with C.V.T.'s will be in production in Spring Hill by the end of March, Ms. Frakes said. The Vue is to follow a few weeks later. 
 G.M. has a supply of C.V.T.'s that have been ''recalibrated and will be used to restart production,'' she said. ''We have found what we feel is a good fix.''
 When news of a problem began to circulate several weeks ago, it made some owners nervous, said Charlie Eickmeyer, who created a site for enthusiasts called SaturnFans.com. But even before G.M. extended the warranty Mr. Eickmeyer expressed confidence that Saturn wouldn't leave customers in the lurch.
 About 82,000 Saturn C.V.T.'s have been produced since the transmission became available in May 2002.
 Eric Fedewa, director of global powertrain forecasts for CSM Worldwide of Farmington Hills, Mich., a market intelligence and forecasting service for automotive suppliers, said: ''The technology is a great technology, a proven technology. And some companies are having good success and some are not. The ones who are successful are ones who have a long history with C.V.T.'s; other companies look like they are still trying to sort it out.'' 
 Other vehicles with C.V.T.'s include the Audi A4 and A6; Honda Civic HX, Civic Hybrid and Insight; Nissan Murano; and Toyota Prius. Ford plans to offer a C.V.T. in its 2005 Five Hundred and Mercury Montego sedans and Freestyle utility wagon.
 G.M. matches its C.V.T. only with the 2.2-liter 4-cylinder Ecotec engine. The transmission is a $1,990 option on the front-drive Vue and is standard with all-wheel drive. It is a $900 option on the Ion Quad Coupe. 
 Ms. Frakes said that the current problems were not related to those that delayed the transmission's introduction in the Vue in December 2001. G.M. says those problems involved inconsistent machining of parts so that they did not always match specifications, causing variations from transmission to transmission. 
 Here are some other Saturn developments that emerged in recent weeks: 
 G.M. said it would end production of the midsize Saturn L300 a year earlier than planned. Year-to-date sales through February were down 74 percent for the Opel-based car, which never met expectations. The L-Series plant in Wilmington, Del., will stop production by the end of June and is scheduled to reopen in mid-2005 to produce a new Pontiac roadster, the Solstice.
 Saturn will add a sporty car to its lineup in early 2006. It will be built at the same Delaware plant that will manufacture the Solstice. Both will be built on a new platform called Kappa, for rear-drive small cars.
 Saturn will introduce three other new products in the next three years: the Relay, a minivan with sport utility styling, due due this fall; a new midsize car in 2006; and a larger sport utility vehicle.
 In addition, the Vue scored poorly in reliability ratings released last week by Consumer Reports, ranking below all small S.U.V.'s except the Land Rover Freelander. But the magazine's list of trouble spots did not indicate a particular problem with the Vue's transmissions.

HEADLINE: 7-Hour Hostage Drama Ends With an Arrest

BYLINE: By ALAN FEUER and OREN YANIV

 BODY:
An unemployed man held his invalid grandmother hostage for nearly seven hours in a Bronx apartment yesterday, firing as many as 100 shots at the police through her apartment door before he was subdued by officers using Taser guns.
 The man, Adam Perry, 32, was led in handcuffs from the Forest Houses on East 166th in the Morrisania section about 4:30 p.m. by a dozen or so of the scores of police officers who had surrounded the building on the ground and in the air. 
 The police received the first call to the apartment, where the grandmother and other relatives live, at 9:34 a.m., police officials said. Mr. Perry's father, Anthony Perry, told the police that he left the apartment when his son began brandishing one of three guns he had. He left behind the grandmother. Berthel Drewitt, 85, who neighbors said is confined to a wheelchair and was recently released from a nursing home. For the next seven hours, scores of officers, including some from the department's elite Emergency Service Unit, cordoned off East 166th Street for several blocks around the apartment complex and waited. The authorities evacuated the third floor of Mr. Perry's building and at least one apartment across the street. 
 Although police negotiators tried several times to communicate with Mr. Perry by cell phones they had managed to get inside the apartment, he refused to use them, the chief negotiator, Lt. Jack Cambria, told reporters after the standoff was over. Lt. Cambria said police negotiators were forced to talk with Mr. Perry through the apartment door, from behind a bulletproof shield.
 ''He would talk to us and then just pull away from us, at times demonstrating a great amount of anger,'' Lt. Cambria said.
 He said that other than asking to speak with his friends. Mr. Perry never made any specific demands. The police allowed him speak to one old friend, Kevin Davis, Lt. Cambria said, adding, ''He had impact but not enough for him to come out.''
 At one point, the police said, Mr. Perry thrust the gun out the window but did not fire. About four hours into the standoff, police officers lowered bulletproof shields to cover the windows of the apartment. 
 Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, who went to the scene about 4 p.m., told reporters that Mr. Perry was upset at having recently been laid off from his job in the mailroom of the Sony Corporation. Mr. Perry's friends also said that he was bitter at having lost his job and that he was depressed because his brother, Anthony, had died of a heart attack at the age of 37 during the citywide blackout last August.
 ''He had a bad case going on,'' said Mr. Davis, the friend.
 Lamont Chapman, 33, who lived with Mr. Perry on Prospect Avenue in the Bronx, 
 also said that his roommate was going through a rough spell. ''He's doing it out of paranoia,'' Mr. Chapman said.
 In the late afternoon, police negotiators convinced Mr. Perry to toss his weapons from a window of the apartment, Mr. Kelly said, adding that for some odd reason Mr. Perry then started to sweep the floors of the apartment with a broom.
 A team of five officers was sent into the apartment to arrest him, Mr. Kelly said, but when the team tried to enter the apartment Mr. Perry blocked the door. The officers then shot him twice with electric Taser guns and subdued him, Mr. Kelly said.
 About 4:30 p.m., a transmission was sent out over police channels saying, ''He's in custody.'' After another minute, an officer on a police radio said, ''He's handcuffed.''
 Moments later, Mr. Perry was led from the building wearing a white tank-top and blue sweatpants or pajamas. The charges against him include attempted murder and unlawful imprisonment, the police said. 
 Mr. Kelly said that Mr. Perry had a lot of ammunition left when he was arrested. He added that Mr. Perry had nine previous arrests, which included convictions on charges of burglary and drug possession.
 Ms. Drewitt, who is Mr. Perry's maternal grandmother, was found unharmed and sitting on a couch, the commissioner said. 
 ''Everything worked out, thank God for that,'' said Mr. Chapman, the roommate. ''He gave in. I got my own place now.''

 From the rubble of defeat, the Third Reich has re-emerged like some malign, ubiquitous phoenix. The misdeeds of Hitler, Eichmann and Goebbels fill airwaves and lecture halls, and still the public hungers for more. At the start of the 21st century, the standard bibliography on the subject listed some 37,000 works on Nazism, 12,000 of these having appeared in the previous five years alone. Will not historians at our century's end look back and scratch their heads in bemusement? The millions of victims of state violence in China or the Soviet Union rate only a fraction of this attention, the killing fields of Cambodia and Rwanda still less. Yet the Nazis keep marching on, while the Holocaust has been turned into a moral touchstone, an unparalleled example of evil that we are exhorted to keep constantly in mind. Faced with two hefty new works -- the 600-page first volume of a projected trilogy on the Third Reich, and a detailed study of the origins of the Final Solution -- one wonders what more remains to be learned. 
 Richard J. Evans's ''Coming of the Third Reich'' is an enormous work of synthesis -- knowledgeable and reliable, and playing to the author's strengths as it highlights the interconnections between politics and society. Evans, the author of several books about Nazi Germany, reminds us at the outset that we should not read too much into the activities of nasty but small anti-Semitic and nationalist extremist groups before World War I. Instead he underscores the importance of the postwar crisis, a Germany left bitterly divided between Social Democrats and Communists, an economy ravaged by unemployment and a country led astray by a political and industrial elite with no real commitment to democracy. This is a vivid although familiar account of why the Weimar Republic collapsed. Evans shows how the ingredients for Nazi triumph were assembled and what was needed to make them jell: add war and depression, cook in a turbulent political atmosphere for several years and serve hot. 
 There are of course many ways to bake this particular cake. Paradoxically, it suited both the Nazis and their Social Democratic opponents to claim that the Third Reich represented a radical break with pre-1933 politics, and this is the picture Evans presents too. A more European perspective might have shown Weimar in a different light. The book does not dwell much on World War I, nor, more surprisingly, does it have much to say about the effect of the Versailles peace settlement and the territorial losses this inflicted upon Germany. Hitler was not the only one to bang on about the plight of those Germans left stranded after 1918 on the wrong side of the Polish or Czech borders; his commitment to do something for them, by force if necessary, struck a chord in a country where the Association for Germandom Abroad, an influential lobbying group, had two million members and where the League of Nations was widely believed to be an organization biased in favor of Germany's enemies.
 One of the merits of ''The Origins of the Final Solution'' is that it shows how important the question of land and minorities really was. This magisterial work does offer us something new -- an unrivaled account of how the Nazi leadership ended up with a policy of industrialized mass murder of Jews as it fought a war of territorial expansion against the threats supposedly posed by Polish nationalism and Soviet Bolshevism. Probably no one is better qualified for this task than Christopher R. Browning. His earlier works uncovered eager Foreign Office officials trying to second-guess Hitler on the Jewish question, death squads of middle-aged Hamburg policemen, soldiers executing Jews in Serbia amid an escalating partisan war. The way he told it, their actions made genocide seem like an exercise in wartime problem-solving rather than the unfolding of some grand design. Now, in this summation of more than 20 years of research, he explains how the grand design emerged as well, and points the way to a reintegration of the whole subject in a much broader history of nationalist conflict, forced population movements and colonial settlement.
 The first thing he conveys is the importance of the war itself. Everything happened so fast. Forget the talk of blueprints for destruction festering in Hitler's mind over decades: genocide was the product of military success after 1939 and the political dilemmas this brought in its wake. The Nazis dreamed of reclaimed lands colonized by racially healthy bodies. As Himmler put it, ''One only possesses a land when even the last inhabitant of this territory belongs to one's own people.'' But as so often happens, others -- in this case Catholic and Jewish Poles -- were already inconveniently living in the proposed ''Garden of Eden.'' Hitler's advisers told him not to talk about military occupation, because they wished to circumvent the requirements of international law ''to which we doubtless shall not submit.'' Their thinking soon became clearer: to establish the new greater Germany that was the war's main purpose, some Polish territory would be annexed and resettled by ethnic Germans repatriated from the Baltic states, South Tyrol and the Soviet Union. Houses, farms and fields would be obtained for them by expelling their non-German owners into what was left of Poland. 
 The Nazi solution to the Polish question aimed to unmix its intermingled populations by deporting hundreds of thousands of people. Thanks to the lethal combination of an efficient transportation system and extreme racist ideology, no more than a few months were needed to bring about acute overcrowding in the ghettos to the east, labor shortages, sabotage and economic disruption in the west. Over one million destitute Poles, Jewish and non-Jewish, were shunted into rump Poland, but only 200,000 ethnic Germans were settled in their place. It was chaos. There were too many of the wrong sort of bodies, not enough of the right ones -- the usual nationalist nightmare demographics. Browning shows in grim detail how violence created problems that more violence was then called upon to solve. 
 Tens of thousands of civilians were killed; priests, politicians and teachers were shot in mass executions. There was plenty of talk of ''extermination,'' but as yet the murder of entire populations was not on the agenda. In fact, the Soviets were probably killing more people in eastern Poland than the Germans were in the west. As for its self-inflicted Jewish problem, even in 1940 Berlin hoped emigration would work: a prewar idea to turn the French colony of Madagascar into a Jewish reservation was taken seriously, until failure to defeat the British relegated it to the scrap-heap. For a while after that, all was confusion and uncertainty; the Catholic Poles were exploited for slave labor, but no one really knew what to do with the Jews of Poland and the Reich, let alone those in the rest of the Continent. 
 It took three separate developments to allow the idea of systematically killing all the Jews of Europe to crystallize in Hitler's mind. One was the planning for a new kind of total war -- a war of annihilation -- with the Soviet Union. Formed in the spring of 1941, special SS death squads roamed the occupied Soviet territories after the invasion in June. At first they targeted Jewish men and Communists, two categories readily conflated in Nazi minds; but from mid-August they began to massacre Jews of all ages. Evidently their orders had changed and Soviet Jewry was to be wiped out. 
 At about the same time, in an unrelated development, the main euthanasia program in the Reich itself was wound down in the face of public disquiet. Run from a special office in Hitler's chancellery, this had already killed about 70,000 mentally ill patients through gassing. From September, its unemployed personnel were offering their murderous expertise in the annexed Polish territories and getting a warm response from hard-pressed officials there. In October Himmler commissioned the construction of new killing camps with gas chambers, while other SS mechanics were busy turning ordinary trucks into mobile gas vans. The same month all Jewish emigration from Europe was halted. By this point, Browning argues persuasively, Hitler had decided on ''biological annihilation'' as the Final Solution to the Jewish Question. The chief killing technology had been found. All that remained was implementation.

HEADLINE: A Nation Unto Himself

BYLINE: By Jennifer Senior.

 BODY:

[Intruders in the House of Saud]
Part II
If, in the future, the war on terrorism is fought in the orderly confines of the courtroom and not just in the caves of Tora Bora, then incriminating documents could become the equivalent of smart bombs. Ronald L. Motley, who has made a career of coaxing such documents from the shadows, made this clear in our very first phone conversation, during which he could barely contain his delight. ''Have you heard of Mohammed Fakihi?'' he demanded, in a drawl rich enough to fill a doughnut. ''Investigated by the German police?''
 Well, no --. 
 ''That fella had a computer,'' he continued. ''And do you know what I did with that computer?'' 
 He allowed a capacious pause.
 ''I'll tell you what I did,'' he said. ''I bought it.''
 As a trial lawyer, Motley thinks of terrorism not just as a form of war, but as a business -- a depraved, ruthlessly efficient business, whose financiers must be exposed and held accountable for their role in sowing harm. In the case of Sept. 11, Motley, like many in the American intelligence community, concluded that the 19 hijackers would never have been able to carry out their plans without generous Saudi assistance. Nineteen months ago, he filed a civil lawsuit in federal court in Washington charging that a wide variety of parties from the kingdom sponsored the attacks, either directly or indirectly, by making donations to institutions that they knew fostered terrorism. Among the case's 205 defendants are seven Saudi charities, including the largest in the Muslim world; three Saudi financial institutions, including one that is now state-run; dozens of prominent Saudi individuals; and perhaps most audaciously, several members of the royal family, for whom Motley has a rich assortment of epithets. Though Motley is not the only tort lawyer in the United States to have filed an international lawsuit in connection with Sept. 11, his case is by far the largest and most lavishly financed of its kind: he has already spent more than $12 million, most of it his own money or his firm's, investigating the case. The families of 1,667 people who died that day, as well as 1,197 men and women who sustained injuries, have signed on.
 With all due respect, I asked Motley, how did he, rather than the F.B.I. or the C.I.A, gain custody of Fakihi's computer?
 ''Well, think about it this way,'' he said. ''If you had information -- a computer hard drive, a Mullah Omar document or whatever your currency might be -- would you necessarily want to give it to the F.B.I.? Why, you might wind up in Guantanamo Bay. Which is not a pleasant place to be, I understand.''
 Nor does it hurt, one imagines, that when it comes to procuring the hard drives of individuals with potentially valuable information, Motley is willing to pay a handsome fee. (Though in this case, the seller, who Motley said was on the lam, charged only $4,000, on the condition that Motley's people also take his car off his hands.) 
 Motley built a successful legal career by winning quixotic lawsuits -- first against asbestos companies, which made him an extravagantly wealthy man, and then as a central player in the huge, 46-state case against Big Tobacco, at a time when going after cigarette manufacturers was a demonstrable route to bankruptcy. But whatever risks he took in suing multibillion-dollar corporations pale in comparison to this terrorism case. In trying to use domestic courts to redress the problem of global terror, Motley is potentially subverting, or at least opening to redefinition, the very notion of diplomacy. He and his clients are effectively acting as their own nation. This is naturally worrisome to international-relations professionals, who wonder whether profit-seeking trial lawyers have the legitimacy, expertise or proper motivations to be making foreign policy. ''That's why we have a government,'' said Sean D. Murphy, who served as a State Department lawyer from 1987 to 1998. ''It's elected to make some of the hard calls about how to handle foreign countries.'' 
 That may be so. The problem, as Motley sees it, is that sometimes governments are not in the position to make those hard calls, whether it be for political or for commercial reasons. So instead, they make easy ones. They resort to gentle persuasion, and their pleas fall on deaf ears. ''Since 1999,'' Motley said later, ''officials at the highest levels of our government have tried repeatedly to warn the Saudis about terrorism funding. And what did they do? They ignored them.''
 He took another dramatic pause. 
 ''Which is why our defendants,'' he concluded, ''ought to be held accountable in an American court.''
Unlike most of the litigation filed in the aftermath of Sept. 11, which involves a fairly traditional body of laws and assumes a predictable pattern (the victims' families suing the airlines suing the insurers), the sweeping antiterrorism case brought by Ron Motley relies on new and evolving legal terrain, and its key defendants live in a Muslim monarchy halfway around the world. The United States also happens to consider this monarchy an ally, no matter how imperfect it may be. While Motley is aiming at other foreign parties, too, and while he is not suing the kingdom of Saudi Arabia itself, he is making a rather provocative statement by going after the kingdom's prominent citizens, banks and even some of its leaders. The State Department, while not formally weighing in against the suit, is watching it warily: the last thing it desires is the transformation of the American legal system into a blunt instrument of foreign policy. Bankrupting terrorism is certainly a national priority, even an urgent one, but hardly the task the diplomatic corps wants to entrust to a man who once, during closing arguments, wore a toy stethoscope in court. 
 Motley insists, frequently and not always convincingly, that he doesn't mean to make a national nuisance of himself; he is simply trying to address a fundamental injustice. Why, in the context of terrorism, should the needs of the state be privileged above the rights of the victims? Or, put another way, why should the flesh-and-blood targets of terrorist attacks -- the deceased and the bereaved -- take a back seat to the less tangible target, the state?
 ''Going through the court system and trying to take their money is the only recourse I have,'' explained Deena Burnett, the first client to sign on to Motley's suit. Her husband, Thomas, was on United Airlines Flight 93, which crashed into the empty field in Shanksville, Pa. ''I can't join the military. It would be impractical for me to go abroad. But if I can put a stranglehold on their finances,'' she said, ''it assists our president in the war on terrorism.''
 Whether George W. Bush is grateful for her assistance is another matter. As Motley, a generous donor to the Democratic Party, is fond of pointing out, the president's ties to the Saudi kingdom are personal as well as political: his father, George H.W. Bush, was until recently a senior adviser to the Carlyle Group, an investment firm that counted bin Laden family members among its investors until October 2001. James Baker, whom Bush recently sent abroad seeking help to reduce Iraq's debt, is still a senior counselor for the Carlyle Group, and Baker's Houston-based law firm, Baker Botts, is representing the Saudi defense minister in Motley's case. 
 Yet however committed a Democrat Motley might be, Burnett v. Al Baraka Investment and Development Corporation, as the case is known, could hardly be described as a partisan crusade. Allan Gerson, a Washington lawyer and Motley's co-counsel, worked in the Reagan Justice Department. Private legal actions against terrorist financiers also have the support of a number of prominent Congressional Republicans, who have shown dwindling patience with the Bush administration's gingerly approach to Saudi diplomacy. Senator Arlen Specter, the Pennsylvania Republican, strongly supports Motley's investigation. Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, was one of the original proponents of the legislation Motley is relying on for his case. In December, Grassley sent a sternly worded letter to the Treasury Department, demanding to know why the United States was slower than Europe to freeze certain Saudi assets. Last July, Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican and former chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, publicly chastened the administration for classifying 28 pages reportedly about the Saudis from a Congressional report on Sept. 11.
 Recently, I asked Shelby if he was nervous that Burnett might complicate life for the president. His answer was blunt. ''If Ron Motley can help unravel the mystery of a lot of terrorist financing,'' he said, ''I don't care who the president of the United States is. Or where the trail leads.''
 Assuming the answer is Saudi Arabia, what does that make Motley's case, exactly? A glorified, globalized tort suit? Or an example of a new wartime jurisprudence, one that fights terrorism with lawyers as well as guns and statesmen? The answer, in a sense, is both, and it could be the new way of the world. Those who take a dim view of Motley's work, dismissing it as nothing more than worldwide ambulance chasing, will be startled to learn that it is theoretically possible, in today's borderless society, to follow a screaming siren all the way to Riyadh. ''Telling U.S. courts not to evaluate international tort claims is like King Canute telling the tide not to come in,'' said Harold Hongju Koh, the international law expert and next dean of Yale Law School. ''I'm sorry, but the sun is coming up tomorrow, and it's called globalization.''
Last fall Motley stood at a podium of a hotel conference room in suburban Virginia, addressing a large gathering of families of airline-disaster victims. ''Let's pick on the Saudis for a moment,'' he said, grinning as the C-Span cameras rolled. He's regulation height, with a face that reddens easily and hair that's prone to feathering behind his ears. ''I loooove,'' he continued, ''to pick on the Saudis.'' 
 Motley, 59, is usually a dervish of energy and restless tics. His eyes dart and his fingernails tip-tap; in conversation he regularly interrupts himself. But not here. As soon as he stands before a crowd, armed with a PowerPoint presentation and a linear legal argument, that energy field of mayhem disappears.
 ''I think,'' he said, ''that we should be very angry with the Saudis.''
 In order to justify his latest legal undertaking, Motley must establish that the Arabian Peninsula is the fund-raising capital for merchants of terror. Though the allegation has always drawn adamant denials from the Saudis -- their Washington embassy refuses to comment on Motley's case -- it is not, from the intelligence-community point of view, a particularly controversial point. In the months after Sept. 11, Treasury and National Security officials appeared before Congress, declaring Saudi Arabia the epicenter of terrorism financing. (This, in fact, was the precise phrase used by David Aufhauser, a former general counsel to the Bush Treasury Department who was also chairman of the National Security Council's committee on terrorist financing.) Perhaps the most scathing declaration on the subject appeared in a report from the Council on Foreign Relations, issued 17 months ago: ''It is worth stating clearly and unambiguously what official U.S. government spokespersons have not. For years, individuals and charities based in Saudi Arabia have been the most important source of funds for Al Qaeda, and for years the Saudi officials have turned a blind eye to this problem.'' 
 While Motley suggests that Saudi money occasionally takes a direct path into Al Qaeda's coffers -- generally via wealthy individual donors -- it more frequently takes a circuitous route, either through the clean-and-rinse cycle of quasi-legitimate businesses or, more commonly, through a highly complex web of Muslim charities, which receive a steady stream of alms from both individuals and Saudi banks. Some of the charities named in Motley's suit are already the subjects of federal criminal investigations. But others, like the Muslim World League, are highly esteemed in the Arab world.
 ''Here's how I would explain to a jury all this legal mumbo jumbo,'' Motley told the crowd in the hotel conference room. The graphic behind him changed to a cartoon of heaving smokestacks and tangled pipes. ''This,'' he said, ''is a terrorist factory. Let's call it Al Qaeda Inc. And those smokestacks are spewing out terror, hatred, jihad, suicide bombers. So who's liable if you've lost a loved one to Al Qaeda Inc.?'' He looked around. ''It's the bank that loaned the money. It's the architect who designed the factory, knowing it was going to be spewing out hatred. It's the suppliers who supplied the factory with ingredients to manufacture terrorist acts. They're all responsible, each and every one.'' He thumped the podium. ''That's the law of the United States.''
 Congress has indeed passed several antiterrorism laws over the last dozen years. In 1992, it enacted a law that said terror victims could sue for civil damages; in 1994, it explicitly criminalized providing ''material support'' for terrorist activities, making sure the definition included not just money but also lodging, training, personnel, telecommunications equipment, false documents, safe houses, transportation -- as broad a range of terrorism services as the authors of the bill could identify. In 1996, Congress also made it possible to file civil suits against foreign governments identified by the State Department as sponsors of terrorism.
 The problem with these statutes -- particularly those involving ''material support'' -- is that they are vague, largely untested and now being challenged partly on First Amendment grounds. For now, Motley is relying on just a handful of precedents to make his case, hoping they aren't overturned along the way. The most important emerged from the Seventh Circuit in the summer of 2002, when the appeals court refused to dismiss a case against several American-based institutions alleged to have contributed to the Palestinian militant group Hamas; the court declared that the institutions could, under certain circumstances, be held liable for the Hamas killing of an American student, David Boim, in the West Bank, even if the charities had nothing to do with the specific planning of the murder. ''Civil liability for funding a foreign terrorist organization,'' the opinion stated, ''does not offend the First Amendment so long as the plaintiffs are able to prove that the defendants knew about the organization's illegal activity, desired to help that activity succeed and engaged in some act of helping.'' The case, commonly known as Boim, is now in federal court in Chicago.
 Of course, with a case involving 205 defendants, many of them armed with the finest legal representation that money can buy, Motley can expect a world's worth of obstacles before Burnett ever gets that far. There will be motions to dismiss, extensions, delays -- all manner of procedural jujitsu that will probably keep the case going for years. Perhaps the biggest procedural obstacle of all is the question of jurisdiction: unlike Boim, Motley's case goes mainly after parties abroad. While collectively they have substantial American assets, it's unclear whether American courts will feel comfortable asserting jurisdiction over them. ''The courts,'' Gerson said, ''have to become involved in dealing with the reality of foreign affairs.''
 From behind the podium, Motley told the audience that he was about to run what he said was a surveillance video made in 1997 by the Madrid Qaeda cell. He warned it would be chilling. ''When we intervened with the Spanish prosecution of this case,'' he explained, ''the judge gave it to us.'' 
 For Motley, Burnett is a case not ultimately about foreign policy but about facts, which means that proving his defendants knowingly provided material support to terrorists is his other significant legal challenge. For the last two years, he has bankrolled a worldwide intelligence-gathering operation that makes the discovery process, ordinarily marked by subpoenas and dry depositions, read like a Tom Clancy novel. One process server he hired, he told me, disappeared in Saudi Arabia. Motley himself has received death threats, prompting him to hire a 350-pound former Army sergeant, the same bodyguard who accompanied him during the tobacco years. 
 Around the globe, Motley has hired 10 foreign ''informants'' -- including a former Taliban official -- whom he insists on referring to by code names (Arnold, the Albanian, the Muslim, Top Source). He has also hired Jean-Charles Brisard, a French intelligence expert, to persuade foreign governments to cooperate with his suit. Brisard is the author of the European best seller ''Forbidden Truth,'' which posited that before Sept. 11 the Bush administration tried to coerce the Taliban into surrendering Osama bin Laden in exchange for a lucrative oil pipeline.
 Motley asked his assistant to show the video. The footage at first looked like any tourist video -- a busy Manhattan streetscape, food vendors and people whizzing by, a seemingly reverential shot of the green sign that says Wall Street. Then the camera slowly panned up and down the length of the World Trade Center, while a voice spoke in Arabic. The subtitle translated: ''I'll knock them all down.'' 
From the very earliest days of his career, Motley showed the kind of passion, cocksureness and hallucinatory sense of possibility that have long made trial lawyers a metabolically distinctive species. He lived on credit cards, spent weeks on the road, drank hard in the evening and jogged long in the morning. He took on projects that seemed like surefire losers, sometimes to the utter disgust of his colleagues. To this day, said his partner, Joe Rice, ''Ron just assumes there'll be money there to pay the bills.''
 Yet few who know Motley, including his adversaries, would dispute his talents as a lawyer. He thinks quickly, possesses a gift for making difficult concepts accessible and can quote, almost verbatim, documents and testimony he read months before. In the courtroom, he lurches between ruthlessness and shameless vaudeville but still manages to endear himself to juries, probably because his antics -- like bringing water guns to court -- provide relief from the undertaker-sonorousness of most defense lawyers. Slowness he finds infuriating, especially these days, as he waits for documents from his more leisurely and bureaucracy-prone counterparts in Europe. (''They meet more often than the elders of the Church of the Nazarene,'' Motley complained. ''And probably get less done.'')
 But underneath the comedy runs a hard streak of determination. ''With Ron, there's this huge sense of wanting to beat the pants off Goliath,'' said Paul Hanly, a New York lawyer also working on the Burnett case, who in previous years opposed Motley as a defense attorney. ''And then there's this whole populist thing -- that he's up against the Republican-funded, blue-chip, white-shoe Wall Street law firms who wouldn't have hired him as a paralegal when he graduated from law school.''
 Motley grew up in North Charleston, S.C. From the time he was tall enough to reach the nozzle, he pumped gas at his father's service station in a mostly black, working-class section of town. He attended the University of South Carolina, had a brief stint as a high-school history teacher, then returned to the university for law school. His ascent after graduation was swift. He had his own name on the law-firm door by 1975. He became the youngest president of the South Carolina Trial Lawyers Association in 1977. During the early 1980's, he formed an archipelago of agreements with law firms around the country, trying asbestos cases by the dozen. Then, in 1993, the Mississippi attorney general, Michael Moore, recruited Motley and a handful of other lawyers to lead an improbable assault against Big Tobacco on behalf of his state. The case ultimately swelled into a gargantuan project involving dozens of plaintiffs' lawyers representing 46 states and five United States territories. Motley's firm represented 25 government entities and, in a remarkable settlement in 1998, secured $246 billion for them over the course of 25 years. 
 Motley's firm reaped an estimated $2 billion in fees from the tobacco settlement, too, but the money seemed only to fuel an already festering tension between Motley and his partners. As he was gambling on Big Tobacco, they were toiling away on less risky, less glamorous cases, trying to keep the firm solvent. Then Motley started talking about 9/11 litigation, even though he'd never tried a single international case in his life. The partnership, Ness, Motley, Loadholt, Richardson & Poole, dissolved in 2002. Motley and Rice went on to form their own firm, based in Mount Pleasant, S.C.
 Motley's fans concede that to know him is to appreciate his pandemonium, but he also has a quieter side. ''He has this reputation for being a brash, successful plaintiffs' lawyer,'' said Marc Kasowitz, who faced Motley in the tobacco years as a lawyer for the Liggett Group. ''But in person, he's very straightforward, actually, and sort of a sensitive guy.'' During the asbestos years, Rice recalled, Motley took breaks from his depositions of witnesses with lung disease to go outside and cry.
 Opportunistic and compassionate, bombastic and fragile, undisciplined and focused -- it's a binary personality code that applies to a lot of successful people, and it applies rather vividly to Motley, who for all his bluster still stands with the sloped posture of someone who's both heartsick and disappointed in himself. He is three times divorced, admits he still drinks more than he should and now regrets, in ways he could hardly have imagined, that he saw too little of his two children as they were growing up. When Thomas Burnett's father phoned in the winter of 2001, inquiring about a potential Sept. 11 lawsuit, what drew Motley in were doubtless the same things that always did -- money, publicity, outrage, intellectual sport. But there was something else, too, and that was a terrible sense of identification: his own 28-year-old son, Mark, had died just 10 months before, following experimental surgery for epilepsy. When he met the Burnetts in person three months later, he told them so.
 ''Understand, it's not like I use it as a marketing tool,'' Motley told me. ''But people who haven't been through it, they don't know what it's like to be in the fog of death.'' He was silent for a second. ''Like I'm told I did my son's eulogy. I'm told I got up that morning, wrote it out and never read from a script. I'm told that it was the most eloquent thing anybody's ever heard. And I don't remember a word I said.''
Twitching his eyes and bouncing his knees, Motley sat in the pillowed corner of a common room at the Pentagon City Ritz-Carlton last October, drowning in his own adrenaline. He was preparing for a hearing in Washington the next day, during which a judge was to entertain motions to dismiss the two highest-profile defendants in his case: Prince Turki al-Faisal, the former head of Saudi intelligence, and Prince Sultan bin Abdel Aziz, the Saudi minister of defense. 
 ''Say,'' he shouted to a colleague. ''Have you gotten that memo on the Prince of Baloney yet?'' Motley was referring to Prince Turki, whom he also once referred to on television as ''Prince Cooked Goose.'' He turned and elaborated. ''Turki gave a speech last night and labeled our charges baloney. So now we have a new name for him.''
 Gerson, rabbinical and elegant in a three-piece suit -- Motley was in sweats -- gently admonished him, suggesting that perhaps he ought not call the princes names.
 As a trial lawyer, Motley is a generalist. Though clearly important to him, Burnett ultimately amounts to another chapter in a long and varied career. The same cannot be said of Gerson. Thoughtful, arrogant and tangibly intense, he has spent most of his adult life contemplating the relationship between individuals and nations -- first as chief counsel to the American delegation to the United Nations under Jeane Kirkpatrick, then as a lawyer in the Reagan Justice Department working on international affairs. When Gerson discusses Burnett, he talks in sweeping, conceptual terms, not tactical ones. His attitude toward the case borders on the messianic.
 Like many specialists in international law, Gerson said he believes that domestic courts have a role to play in holding foreign parties accountable for their misdeeds. He came of age as a doctoral student at Yale under the tutelage of Myers McDougal, the eminence grise of international law, who preached that lawyers had a legitimate role in advancing political objectives. As soon as he entered the private sector, he began to put this philosophy into practice, becoming the first lawyer to file a civil suit against Libya for the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. Shortly after Sept. 11, he had an idea for a similar suit aimed at Saudis. A colleague introduced him to Motley in the spring of 2002, at the private-jet area of Dulles airport, where Motley had diverted his plane in order to meet him. Having already agreed to represent the Burnetts, Motley was digging a tunnel in the same direction. The two men -- a Democratic trial lawyer and a neoconservative Reaganite -- made a verbal agreement that afternoon.
 What Gerson sees in Burnett is the perfect opportunity for the judiciary to play a critical role in the war on terror, punishing those enemies of the United States that the executive branch, hamstrung by diplomatic considerations, cannot. ''If we left justice solely to the U.S. government, when it has so many commercial and other interests with countries like Saudi Arabia, what action would be taken?'' he asked. ''We've refused to join the international criminal court. And trying to accuse a foreign country of criminal activity gets us into a terrible diplomatic mess. So why shouldn't they be held responsible in our courts?''
 To those accustomed to the genteel rites of diplomacy, the adversarial American court system may seem an unfortunate forum to engage questions of international wrongdoing. In an affidavit in the Burnett case, Charles Freeman, a former ambassador to Saudi Arabia, disparagingly referred to this solution as ''the privatization of foreign policy.'' Gerson prefers to call it the privatization of justice. Absent the judiciary, he argues, victims of terror have no other means of redressing wrongs. ''Freeman's notion, which represents institutionalized State Department dogma, is like the old idea that the Post Office is only something that the U.S government can do -- it's so antiquated it's absurd,'' he said. ''The idea is that the government is obligated only to itself and responsible to no one. Well, that idea has been eroding with the advent of contemporary human rights. This is the great human rights case. It's the right to be free from terrorism.''
 American civil courts are not unfamiliar with lawsuits involving international human rights. Since 1980, lawyers have made shrewd use of an obscure 1789 law called the Alien Tort Claims Act, originally intended to combat piracy, which gives American courts ''original jurisdiction of any civil action by an alien for a tort only, committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the United States.'' As a result, American judges have heard from Guatemalan victims of torture, from Haitian dissidents and from survivors of the Bosnian genocide. In the last decade, the same law has also been used in an attempt to hold multinational corporations accountable for malfeasance -- like Unocal, for example, for its alleged use of forced labor to provide security for oil pipelines in Myanmar.
 The difference between Alien Tort cases and Burnett, however, can be measured in light years. Alien Tort cases are generally brought by human rights lawyers, working for a pittance, hoping to turn a 215-year-old law into an instrument of justice for citizens around the globe. Burnett is being brought by a plaintiffs' lawyer, toiling for a cut of the proceeds, hoping to use laws recently enacted by a law-and-order Congress to punish those who have brought harm to Americans. One can see how tastelessly opportunistic it might seem from the point of view of the human rights community: plaintiffs' lawyers, swooping in, turning a handsome profit off history's ugliest moments. Yet some human rights experts see real value in Burnett. ''It seems like a righteous case brought by an experienced lawyer,'' said Paul Hoffman, the human rights attorney involved in the Unocal suit. ''And who else has the kind of resources for it? Who else has that kind of cash up front?''
 Motley does, of course. Yet there aren't many precedents for spectacular payoffs in cases like this one. Almost none of the plaintiffs who have sued successfully using the Alien Tort Claims Act have been able to collect from the hostile foreign parties they've targeted; generally, they are awarded default judgments when the defense doesn't show up in court. And most of the successful cases using antiterrorism statutes have been directed at countries on the State Department list of terrorism sponsors, like Iran and Cuba, whose American assets, if there are any, are generally frozen. The victories in all these cases are mainly moral rather than financial. In going after wealthy Saudis and Saudi financial institutions with considerable assets in the United States, Motley is part of the first generation of lawyers trying these cases who might actually be able to collect.
 Unless, that is, the Bush administration tries to block the suit. As a rule the administration favors a limited role for the judiciary in international cases. Later this month, it will argue before the Supreme Court against the use of the Alien Tort statute for human rights cases, absent a law from Congress explicitly allowing as much. Even with an imprimatur from Congress, the president clearly doesn't like Motley's use of the antiterrorism statutes; back in October 2002, news articles reported ''administration officials'' saying that the government was considering asking the courts to dismiss the suit. Victims' families reacted with the outrage you'd expect. The administration never intervened.
 But should the administration consider Motley's suit a threat? David Aufhauser, the former general counsel to the Treasury Department, said he believes that private and government action against terrorism are not mutually exclusive pursuits. ''If brought soberly and with substance, private actions can be of material assistance to the government,'' he said. ''Because I can tell you: the bankers of terror are cowards. They have too much to lose by transparency. Name, reputation, affluence, freedom, status. They're the weak link in the chain of violence. They are not beyond deterrence.'' 
Jean Charles-Brisard, Motley's chief European investigator, was a bit late to arrive at La Reserve Hotel in Geneva one afternoon last December, but it didn't seem to matter. The witness he was meeting, Carmen bin Laden, wasn't ready to speak with him anyway, because she was still talking to a pair of foreign journalists about ''Inside the Opaque Kingdom,'' her chronicle of tribulations within the bin Laden family. When she finally finished, she walked over to Brisard, magisterially shook his hand and took a seat on a hard maroon couch. She was trim, plump-lipped, imposing and, in her own way, spectacular. Her face was stretched as taut as a volleyball net, and her coat collar was a vivid species of fur. She pulled out a cigarette.
 Carmen bin Laden is Osama's Swiss-born sister-in-law. She is currently embroiled in a bitter divorce from his half-brother Yeslam, who is a defendant in Burnett. This makes her, like many of the witnesses in Motley's case, fairly rich in ulterior motives. Her discussion with Brisard did not last long. After just a few minutes, she received a phone call and abruptly left. Brisard turned to me and apologized for her ''bizarre'' behavior. ''She's not a key witness,'' he said. ''She's a contextual witness.''
 Over the course of their investigation, Motley's team has learned what the professional intelligence community has long known: the information trade often involves questionable types. Michael Elsner, an associate at Motley Rice who often accompanies Brisard on these trips, told me of once receiving a phone call from a Russian fellow named Igor who said just enough about Islamic banks and charities operating in Chechnya to earn himself an invitation to chat. The man who showed up was bald, rotund and almost permanently attached to a shining silver briefcase. ''He was supposed to get us things,'' Elsner said. Yet he never returned. It's probably just as well. A background check revealed that Igor had a small problem with embezzling.
 With his $12 million, Motley has begun an investigation that even most nation-states could not afford. But money alone is not enough to form an ersatz C.I.A. Motley sought out former intelligence agents, journalists and professors, all of whom spent their lives obsessing about Al Qaeda. Some turned out to be shady and unreliable. Yet Motley has had some success. Early on, one of his sources in Afghanistan learned of a Taliban fighter who was selling a computer file that he claimed had belonged to Muhammad Atef, military commander for Al Qaeda until he was killed in November 2001 in Afghanistan. The seller wanted $80,000. Motley wired it to Dubai. Motley's team also discovered a document supposedly signed by Mullah Omar containing a directive to turn over $2 million ''in Saudi Arabia aids'' to a terrorist in central Asia. That got attention in the press. 
 But Motley also concedes that his team had a hard time separating wheat from chaff when it began its investigation two years ago. Fakihi's computer, which Motley was so pleased to have obtained, for example, ended up adding little to the information he'd already collected. The car that came with it is still sitting somewhere in Europe.
 Motley is now focusing on the documents culled by foreign governments, which have already been vetted and, presumably, authenticated. This is where Brisard comes in. Though his book was criticized in the United States, he is nevertheless considered an expert on Al Qaeda's financing stream, particularly its Saudi tributaries, and has written a well-respected report on the subject for the United Nations Security Council. So far Brisard has gotten his hands on two million pages of documents from 35 foreign governments, some of them quite tantalizing: Swiss bank records of Osama bin Laden; Albanian intelligence reports on bin Laden business dealings; information from 34 Bosnian hard drives from the offices of Al Haramain Charitable Foundation, which Brisard said he managed to get instead of the F.B.I. (Why? I asked. ''Because the U.S. promised to give them the technology to recover the deleted files, but didn't,'' Brisard answered. ''And we did.'') Recently, added Motley, an Oregon federal prosecutor investigating Al Haramain called him, wondering whether he could have a look at those files. Motley said he obliged.
 One may wonder why these countries would bother cooperating with an American civil lawsuit. Motley has a characteristically blunt explanation. ''Please -- these countries have their own parochial agendas,'' he said. ''Radical Islamic fundamentalism is a huge problem in France. A huge problem in Spain. A terrible problem in Germany. And look at Chechnya! Why do you need to look any further at why Russia's gonna help us? Or look at Jordan. It's a secular kingdom! They're certainly not rah-rah-rah on the Wahhabi movement.''
 How this formidable pile of information will be interpreted by the courts -- if Motley's case ever gets that far -- remains to be seen. For the lay person, any foray into the intelligence world is surreal and initially intoxicating; who wouldn't respond to the formation minutes of Al Qaeda, which the team obtained from Bosnia? If genuine, this and many of Motley's documents are certainly of historical relevance, but whether they're of legal relevance, demonstrating that Motley's defendants knew they were providing material support to terrorists, is another question entirely. 
 ''The claim against my client is that it gave money to charities and the money ended up in the hands of terrorists,'' said Christopher Curran, the lawyer for Al Rajhi Bank, one of the banks being sued by Motley. ''But these were government-regulated and government-approved charities that held themselves out as bona fide charitable organizations. When we Americans donate our clothes to Goodwill or our funds to the United Way, do we really know where it's all going? Don't we also rely on government regulation and the representations of the charities themselves?''
 Even if Motley compiles enough evidence to prove his defendants knowingly financed terrorism, it may not be enough: the judge must still agree that it is appropriate for an American court to assert jurisdiction over them. In the cases of the Saudi Princes Turki and Sultan, for example, the judge did not. In November the United States District Court in Washington ruled that the allegations against the princes, as Saudi officials, were not enough to surmount sovereign immunity, a powerful privilege that protects states and their officials not just from liability but also from lawsuits themselves. 
 The ruling didn't affect Motley's banking, charity and nonsovereign defendants, but his team was devastated when it heard the news. ''The judge proceeded as if it were a time of peace,'' Gerson said, ''and it's a time of war.'' 
For Gerson and Motley, war means interpreting the antiterrorism statutes as aggressively as possible. But even people sympathetic with their efforts think there are limits. Like suing sovereigns. ''Look,'' said Aufhauser, the former Bush administration official, ''you have to be mindful that bringing them into an American court is an invitation for enormous mischief abroad, potentially against former and current U.S. officials . . . like me.''
 The United States more or less had to cope with this problem last year, when Iraqi families, using Belgium's ''universal jurisdiction'' law (now amended to give immunity to world leaders), tried to call Colin Powell, former President Bush and Dick Cheney into court for the bombing of a civilian shelter during the gulf war in 1991. Youssef M. Ibrahim, a former New York Times reporter who is now the managing director of Strategic Energy Investment Group, a consulting firm based in Dubai, told me that two lawyers in Saudi Arabia are flirting with the idea of recruiting Iraqi clients to sue Donald Rumsfeld for the use of depleted uranium munitions in Iraq. What if their targets don't stop with Rumsfeld? And what if they also sue Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman for making those arms? Or their engineers for designing them?
 For those who believe the executive branch should be wholly in charge of foreign policy, Burnett feels like a mockery of international relations, a flagrant end run around the institutions designed to engage the world community. ''If people think we should be tougher on these countries, we have a democratic process to try to bring that about,'' said Murphy, the former State Department official. ''They can vote, they can lobby, they can form networks and lobby even better. But it shouldn't be dictated by the initiatives of just a few victims.''
 Particularly, the argument goes, when Saudi Arabia has an incentive to finally address the problem of terrorist financing itself. In May and November 2003, terrorists blew up housing complexes in Riyadh, which reportedly spurred more on-the-ground intelligence cooperation between the United States and Saudi Arabia than ever before. The Treasury Department, charged with tracing terrorism dollars, noted in an announcement in January that it worked jointly with Saudi Arabia to close down four offices of the charity Al Haramain outside the kingdom. Would now be the time to humiliate Saudi Arabia with a lawsuit, just as our objectives are finally starting to align?
 ''Basically, this is U.S. diplomacy by contingency-fee lawyer,'' said Curran, the defense lawyer. ''No one disputes that all of those responsible for 9/11 should be tracked down and held fully responsible. But in this case, allegations have been made indiscriminately against some of the most prominent and reputable Saudi organizations and citizens -- many of whom are Western-oriented and could play a major role in fostering constructive relations between our two countries. These lawsuits undermine that possibility.''
 Meanwhile, the American budget and trade deficits continue to grow. Is now the time to scare away the foreign investors who are pouring money into the American economy and buying Treasury bonds? Less than a year after Sept. 11, The Financial Times reported, Saudi investors had already withdrawn as much as $200 billion from the United States. ''At the end of the day, I believe this president will prevent this lawsuit,'' Ibrahim said. ''There's nothing more cowardly, as you know, than capital.''
 Some human rights lawyers, though reasonably convinced of the merits of Motley's case, also balk at the ''material support'' clauses it relies so heavily upon, believing they've been defined too broadly and could therefore unwittingly penalize those who give money to groups they consider politically legitimate. ''When Nelson Mandela came to Yankee Stadium, should all the people who put $10 in the hat be treated as terrorists?'' asked David Cole, a human rights lawyer who is leading an aggressive challenge to these statutes. Cole pointed out that not long before, the United States government had labeled the African National Congress a terrorist organization. ''Are we going to go down the road of guilt by association in the name of fighting terrorism, just as we did in the name of fighting Communism?'' Cole said. ''That's my principal concern.''
 Motley would point out that he is not going after $10 donors in his lawsuit, but the gulf states may not view it that way. ''I give to charity personally,'' said Khaled Al-Maeena, editor in chief of The Arab News, an English-language newspaper published in Jidda. ''You can quote me on this. A lot of people supported the Afghan struggle against the Soviet Union. Some of that money may have been siphoned. But that does not mean we are responsible for Sept. 11. Who are these people who are accusing them? They are fat-cat lawyers -- fat-cat lawyers who want to make money.'' 
 Indeed, perhaps the most discomfiting aspect of the Burnett case is the message it sends abroad. The United States already has an international reputation for unquenchable litigiousness. And Motley, often prone to rhetorical excess -- like referring to Prince Turki as Prince Cooked Goose -- hardly seems like the most sensitive champion of private action against foreign defendants. The average Saudi may read about Burnett and feel not deterred but further inflamed: the United States walked away from the Kyoto treaty; it attacked Iraq with only meager international support; it repeatedly flouted the desires of the United Nations. And now, the United States, whose citizens are among the richest and luckiest on Earth, has responded to its misfortune with a trillion-dollar lawsuit aimed at, of all things, some of the most prominent relief organizations in the Middle East. 
 ''A judgment will cause great resentment on the part of the people here,'' Al-Maeena concluded, with a sigh so audible it temporarily muffled our connection across the globe. ''And it will be fuel, I think, for our own extremists.''
In mid-December, the Motley team got some disorienting though not entirely unexpected news. A panel of federal judges ordered the consolidation of all Sept. 11 cases involving foreign defendants into the Southern District of New York. It's for the pretrial phase only, in order to spare the defendants the hassle of showing up in multiple courts for multiple lawsuits, but it nevertheless has its consequences. Motley, who had been following his own rhythms, must now reach a power-sharing agreement with the lawyers representing a dozen or so other cases, and their styles, defendants and theories of liability are not necessarily the same. As it turns out, Motley's first attempt at court-driven diplomacy may not involve his defendants but his new colleagues. And lawyers, of course, get along only slightly better than warring nations. So far, no agreement has been reached. 
 Because Motley has served the most defendants and is representing the most wrongful death claims, he will doubtless have leverage in this deal. And some of the other lawyers now involved in this case could prove a real asset to Motley's team. Like James Kreindler, for example. Though Gerson was the first to sue Libya in the case of Pan Am 103, it was Kreindler, an airline litigation expert, who ultimately represented most of the families. His faint New York patois and familiarity with the folkways of the Southern District also can't hurt; he seems to have a genuine rapport with the new judge in this case, Richard C. Casey. 
 But Kreindler has spent only $2million so far on his suit. A good portion of it went toward examining Al Qaeda's ties with Iraq, which now appears to be moot -- even if he could provide proof, the Bush administration has declared Iraq's assets off-limits. Most important, though, Kreindler's approach to his lawsuit is very different from Motley's. ''You have to handle this case in a delicate way,'' he said, ''in a way that doesn't burn bridges with our government.'' He stressed that he's a Democrat. ''But I believe in letting the government go first in their criminal prosecutions, and it takes years for the government to do its work. But when that's done, you have the weight of the government behind you when you make allegations.''
 This approach does not harmonize well with Motley's instincts. Patience is not his strong suit. ''Jim is the Job of the trial bar for waiting so long on Pan Am 103,'' he said. ''But my clients don't want to wait. They want the trial last week.''
 And yet they may have no choice. The court system, their chosen means of justice, is a fundamentally slow, lumbering thing, and with so many different lawyers and philosophies now thrown in the mix, it seems now to be even slower. Motley's clients, like Motley himself, may have to accept that legal solutions to misfortune, as gratifying and empowering as they seem, still don't give their victims full control.
 Still, Motley is proceeding apace, serving defendants and collecting documents from around the globe. And Bush has yet to interfere. Last year, at a Republican fund-raiser in Little Rock, Deena Burnett said she asked the president what he thought of the lawsuit she had initiated. The two were standing side by side, waiting to have their picture taken together. She said that Bush turned and looked at her, just before the flashbulb popped. ''You just keep doing what you're doing,'' he said. 


CORRECTION-DATE: March 28, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An article on Page 36 of The Times Magazine today about Ron Motley, an American lawyer filing a suit against prominent Saudis and Saudi organizations over supposed connections to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, misstates a phrase in some copies in a quotation from Richard Shelby, an Alabama senator who has criticized the Bush administration for classifying information that may be about the Saudis. He said: ''If we can help unravel the mystery of a lot of terrorist financing, I don't care who the president of the United States is. Or where the trail leads.'' He did not say ''If Ron Motley can help unravel. . . .''
 In some copies the article also omits Mr. Motley's assertion about the administration's response to his investigation. He said it had refused to help him.
An article on March 14 about Ron Motley, an American lawyer filing a suit against prominent Saudis and Saudi organizations over supposed connections to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, misspelled the given name of a Yale professor who was an early influence on Allan Gerson, Motley's co-counsel in the case. He was Myres McDougal, not Myers.

HEADLINE: Finding an X Factor That Spurs Growth

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
ROHIT SAH is happy to consider stocks from any country or industry for his Oppenheimer International Small Company fund, as long as they meet two criteria. The companies must be small, of course, and there must be an extra something about their products, markets or industries that will turn a merely good investment into a spectacular one if circumstances unfold as he expects.
 The fund has been blessed with many extra somethings in the last year, as shareholders have more than doubled their money in the 12 months through Thursday. Of course, much of the fund's return has resulted from the strength of stock markets in general, and of small-capitalization stocks in particular. 
 ''Small-caps tend to outperform at the beginning of a cycle,'' said Mr. Sah, 38, who took over sole management of the fund in December after working on a team that ran it for three years. Before joining Oppenheimer in 1996, he studied mechanical engineering in India, where he was born, and received a doctorate in economics from Columbia University.
 Noting that the stock market ''bottomed out in absolute terms in March 2003, then took off,'' Mr. Sah said that ''anyone with a decent international small-cap portfolio did well.''
 But the Oppenheimer portfolio was more decent than most. In 2003 alone its return was 85.1 percent, or 31 percentage points higher than that of the average fund specializing in small or medium-size foreign companies, according to Morningstar Inc.
 Because of the huge number of small companies in the world, Mr. Sah said, managers who choose their stocks wisely can produce demonstrably better results than their rivals. ''Small caps make up a far bigger potential pool of companies in foreign markets than in the U.S.,'' he said, ''so stock selection becomes absolutely critical.''
 His portfolio is spread across many economies. Japan alone accounts for 27.5 percent of assets, but he said that this was because he liked many individual companies there, not because of any explicit preference for the Japanese economy or stock market. Conversely, there are only a few holdings in Latin America.
 The fund is skewed toward technology stocks, reflecting Mr. Sah's leaning toward growth. ''There are very few small-cap value stocks,'' he said. ''Small caps are best when they are growing rapidly. You don't want to be a $200 million company and growing at 5 percent.'' 
 Last year, he said, ''we were in the right sectors at the right time -- the Internet, telecoms in Europe.'' Technology and telecommunications stocks make up 31 percent of the fund's assets.
 But he says he also keeps an eye on company value. ''When I buy a stock, I have a good sense of what the company is worth,'' he said. ''I look for stocks that are priced to double in the next three years.''
 He said he found growth potential in many industries besides information technology and telecommunications. Although the fund invests in companies whose lines of work barely existed 10 years ago -- like online games or the sending of information over cellphones -- it also invests in business areas that have been around for thousands of years -- like textiles, copper mining and herbal medicine.
 Mr. Sah called iTouch, a British supplier of cellphone data services, ''my favorite right now'' among his holdings. ''The story over there is mobile data content,'' he said of iTouch's home market. ''Where the revenue will come from in that industry is not from more calls, but from using mobile phones as data providers. Wireless data could be big business.'' He said he expected much of the revenue to come from teenagers, who have grown accustomed to downloading games and ring tones over their cellphones.
 Mr. Sah owns shares of a second wireless data company, Index, which is based in Japan. Among its several business lines, he said, the most appealing is the collection of partnerships it has formed with conventional bricks-and-mortar companies that use Index's system to allow customers to buy their products over cellphones. 
 ''Small companies don't have the technology or the inclination to invest to put their business up on cellphones,'' he explained. ''What these guys have done is said, 'We'll team up with you and run your content on cellphones.''' The partners pay a small fee plus a portion of sales.
 Electrovaya, based in Toronto, is a play on smaller, busier cellphones. It makes phone and laptop batteries, which Mr. Sah says pack the most power per unit of volume and last three times as long as ordinary batteries.
 But over the last two years, he said, the company has had manufacturing problems and the stock is now extremely cheap: ''If I'm correct, this stock could double from here and go even higher if the company delivers on its potential. Having said that, the management has continually disappointed. Canadian investors don't even look at this stock.''
 The company's products have attracted interest, however. Electrovaya has won a NASA contract that should mean that shuttle astronauts will be using its batteries.
 Another technology holding is NCsoft, a South Korean provider of online games. Mr. Sah said that the market was already pricing in success for the company's products in Korea and Taiwan, but that ''the big question is whether it becomes big in Japan.'' That could be the extra factor that carries NCsoft's valuation to $3 billion from $1.3 billion, he said.
 AMONG companies in much older industries, Mr. Sah mentioned Inmet Mining, based in Toronto, which owns copper and zinc mines. Prices of base metals have been soaring, but the company still trades at a mere five times earnings, once the ample cash on its books is removed from the equation, he said.
 Inmet's main property is an 18 percent stake in a copper mine in Papua New Guinea. Noting that the mine accounts for 10 percent of that island nation's economy, Mr. Sah said, ''the potential output of this mine is huge, and with high copper prices, I think net income from this mine alone could be 70 million to 130 million Canadian dollars'' ($52.9 million to $98.2 million). That would just about equal the current earnings from all of the company's mines. ''Given the consolidation in this industry, they can use that cash to buy other mines,'' he added.
 Another holding is Arvind Mills, a large Indian manufacturer of denim. Its sales have grown 15 percent annually, and the company is benefiting from a revamping that brought in more professional managers, Mr. Sah said.
 Also in the portfolio is Tsumura, a Japanese company that closed several money-losing units in the late 1990's and has been reborn as a supplier of prescription Chinese herbal remedies in Japan, where it controls 70 percent of the market.
 The prospect that the popularity of herbal remedies will be further underpinned by science could be the catalyst for growth. ''Japanese doctors are being educated about Chinese medicine, so the risk to sales is to the up side,'' Mr. Sah said.

HEADLINE: In This Recovery, a College Education Backfires

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
ROBERT B. REICH called them ''symbolic analysts.'' They were the college-educated workers supposedly insulated from the global pressures that condemned others with less schooling to job insecurity and layoffs. ''Symbolic analysts are in ever greater demand in a world market that places an increasing value on identifying and solving problems,'' Mr. Reich wrote in 1991.
 The message: Get a college education; earn a bachelor's degree, or more. That is your immunization against the outsourcing, offshoring and downsizing that frighten so many workers today. The Clinton administration, in which Mr. Reich served as secretary of labor, pushed that solution, and so has nearly every politician, policy expert and corporate executive. 
 Young people listened, all too well. In this recovery, college graduates are losing ground faster than any other group, and that is partly because there are now so many graduates. More than 27 percent of the population has a bachelor's degree normally earned in four years of schooling. That is up from 21.3 percent in 1990 and 17 percent in 1980, according to the Census Bureau, and the proportion is rising by a percentage point or so every couple years. 
 From this group comes management consultants, lawyers, software and computer engineers, research scientists, corporate executives, financial advisers, strategic planners, advertising executives and television producers. These are Mr. Reich's symbolic analysts, and their great contribution is conceptual thinking.
 No one does that better than America's college graduates, the argument goes. The next great innovation will come from them -- the breakthrough that will keep the United States on top in the global economy and generate jobs within the country for workers with less education, too. 
 That is bedrock theory. Democrats and Republicans both subscribe to it. True, in the raging debate over the offshoring of jobs, various short-term fixes are offered -- protectionist measures, for example, and tax incentives to encourage companies to preserve jobs at home. But the thesis prevails: Our college-educated, with their superior skills, give the United States a long-term natural advantage. Jagdish Bhagwati, a prominent international economist at Columbia University, put it bluntly in an Op-Ed article in The New York Times last month. ''I have taught hundreds of fine foreign students in the last few years, but only a small fraction are at the level of proficiency that Intel looks for in its research program.''
 Well, if America's college graduates --the men and women with the equivalent of a bachelor's degree or more -- are so special and in such demand, why are they suffering in the current job market? No other group has taken the beating they have in the last four years. The percentage of all college graduates 25 and older who hold jobs fell from just over 78 percent in 2000 to just under 76 percent in 2003. That was the lowest level in more than 25 years, according to an analysis of Labor Department data by the Economic Policy Institute, a research group in Washington. And they are joining the rolls of the long-term unemployed at a faster rate than any other group, educated or not.
 The 25- to-35-year-olds have been hit the hardest. The portion employed in this group of college graduates dropped from more than 87 percent in 2000 to 84.1 percent late last year. That was also the lowest since the late 1970's, and their average wage has fallen since 2001.
 Let's not blow these hardships out of context, however. College graduates are still more likely to have jobs than others, and their wages are notably higher. ''In terms of employment, college graduates enjoy a big premium, just not as big as it used to be,'' said Lawrence F. Katz, a labor economist at Harvard. ''They appear more vulnerable to economic shocks than in the past. And we don't fully understand why.'' 
 The bubble economy of the late 1990's contributed to the distress. Companies over-hired the college educated, particularly in high-technology areas. When the bubble burst, many were laid off, and now employers are hiring as few as possible. Unable to raise prices, they hold down costs, particularly the cost of high-wage labor. Demographics play a role. College graduates are being hired. But only 2.5 college grads are landing jobs for every 3.5 getting degrees, and so the ratio of employment to population falls.
 Offshoring is a factor. More than in the past, work done by Mr. Reich's symbolic analysts is migrating to India and China. The numbers are still small, but the sense of vulnerability is widespread. ''What most of these workers have in common is the sense that they have personally been devalued or harmed,'' said Jacob S. Hacker, a political scientist at Yale.
 Mr. Reich says his original assessment, nearly 13 years ago, still holds. He blames insufficient economic growth. Despite a recent surge, the current recovery is one of the weakest on record. ''Once the economy bounces back,'' he said last week, ''college-educated symbolic analysts will be in great demand'' in the United States.
 Like most politicians, economists and policy experts, Democratic and Republican, Mr. Reich keeps his faith in the curative powers of a strong economy. But what if the offshoring bleeds away so much of the work now done by college graduates that the supply of people getting four-year degrees outruns the demand, even in a strong economy? Should government step in, as it did a generation ago, and subsidize job creation to supplement the private sector?
 The Democrats expunged that sort of alternative in the Clinton years, and Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, has not revived it. But Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, a powerful figure in the Democratic Party, is trying to push his party back in this direction. ''We must create new and meaningful jobs for all Americans,'' he declared in a recent speech. ''And we must do this by recognizing once again that government -- an enlightened government -- has an extraordinary responsibility to assist in this task.''
 The speech went unnoticed. Certainly, the nation's symbolic analysts have not picked up the refrain. They might if the demand for their services deteriorates long enough.

HEADLINE: Adapting a New Haven Tower for Assisted Living

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN 

 BODY:
RENOVATION has started on 60 units in an apartment tower for older residents in New Haven under a new government program designed to create assisted-living units in developments that have not previously had them.
 Assisted living, a housing approach for older people who do not require the level of care furnished by nursing homes but need help dressing, bathing and performing other daily routines, is usually found in specially designed retirement communities, where rents can be sizable.
 Tower One/Tower East, a nonprofit low-income retirement community in New Haven, has been introducing more and more assisted living services over the past 10 years, financed by a combination of state and federal funds.
 Because such services are in place, Connecticut has been chosen to become one of 12 states participating in a grant program from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The grants are being made under the federal government's Housing Security Plan for Older Americans, initiated to create alternatives to costly nursing homes. The program provides grants that finance renovations required to provide assisted living for people 62 and older. 
 The first building at Tower One/Tower East was built in 1971 as an independent home for elderly Jewish residents. Now, the development is the first in the state to participate in HUD's pilot program; 95 to 100 subsidized tenants who are receiving assisted living services will have their apartments renovated.
 Improving conditions for tenants keeps them from entering nursing homes prematurely and controls costs by minimizing the time spent in nursing homes. ''It is more humane and more cost effective to keep them where they are, in familiar surroundings,'' said Rick Robbins, community development administrator at the Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development. His department pays $500 a month each for tenants to receive assisted living services, far less than nursing homes would cost. Tenants paying full rent of up to $1,211 pay for services themselves.
 ''Twelve years ago,'' said Dorothy Giannini-Meyers, president and chief executive of Tower One/Tower East, ''we noticed that residents were becoming more frail and having to leave because we had no services to take care of them. In 1990 a Yale study on health and aging helped us put together a survey of what residents would need to stay. We brought in a branch of the New Haven Savings Bank, a convenience store, a series of supportive services and in-house activities trying to keep them independent.'' 
 THE HUD grants became available in the late 90's, and Ms. Giannini-Meyers applied. Three separate grants have been approved, totaling $12 million. Sixty apartments are to be renovated.
 ''We are now taking applications for the new apartments,'' she said. ''There is a waiting list for the first 40 now in work, but applicants can change their minds and people should not be deterred from applying.'' Residents of the apartments being renovated have moved to other units while the work is being done. 
 Renovations at Tower One/Tower East, on Tower Lane off Church Street South, three blocks from the connector to Exit 47 of Interstate 95, required gutting the second through seventh floors of the 21-story building. In addition to creating new apartments, the grant covers conversion of a 6,000- square-foot area on the first floor for administrative offices, a computer learning center, health clinic, resident activities room and an office for Utopia Assisted Living Services Agency, which supplies the services; a new 6,900-square-foot dining room with a movable partition; and a new 500 square-foot main entrance. 
 The current total of 217 apartments will be reduced to 211 because each of the six floors under renovation will have a new ''great room'' area for socializing. Apartment sizes will not change -- 395 square feet for the smallest studio to 465 square feet for the largest one-bedroom -- but some of the space will be taken by updated fully equipped kitchenettes with lower countertops and by larger bathrooms with walk-in showers with seats, grab bars, doors and entry areas widened to five feet to accommodate wheelchairs. 
 Electrical and plumbing lines are being reset to allow for reconfigurations of apartments and relocations of kitchenettes and bathrooms. The building is steel-reinforced concrete, and the project involves drilling through eight inches of concrete, floor by floor, to create new pathways for plumbing and electrical and telephone lines, which must then reconnect with the existing pathways at the 8th through 21st floors. 
 Mark Garilli, project superintendent for the Konover Construction Company, said, ''This is a big safety challenge in a building occupied by people who are frail and easily confused, when we have to cut off hot water or phones on certain floors for several hours.''
 THE building was designed by Charles Moore, then dean of architecture at Yale, and built at a cost of $7 million. Its octagonal shape, with two elevators running up the center surrounded on each floor by a corridor that opens onto the apartments, achieved national attention as a breakthrough in elderly housing. The apartments face out over vistas of Yale University, the city or Long Island Sound. 
 ''There were no amenities in what they called homes for the aged in 1971,'' said Sandra Vlock, a member of the architectural firm of Arbonies King Vlock in Branford, which worked with Mr. Moore. ''Tower One/Tower East created them -- a spacious dining room, places to walk in courtyards and enclosed gardens -- a sense of neighborhood.'' The firm designed the current renovations, and Glenn Arbonies designed Tower East, the adjoining 12-story building.
 Tower One/Tower East's two high-rise buildings on a 4.5-acre parcel have a combined total of 367 apartments with tenants ranging in age from 62 to near 100. Tower One has 92 subsidized apartments, where tenants pay 30 percent of their income, which cannot exceed $32,750 for an individual or $37,450 for a couple. All apartments are carpeted and have window draperies but are furnished by the tenant.
 Rents of $803 for a small studio to $1,489 for a one-bedroom apartment for two people cover utilities (except telephone and cable television), six dinners a week, housekeeping, access to laundry machines on each floor, free health screenings, 24-hour staffing and security, daily personal safety checks, a library, excursions, on-site primary health care, arts and crafts, professional entertainment, religious services or programs, and reserved parking. The rents are ''a fraction of the cost of similar amenities at private luxury retirement communities,'' said Rebecca Goodman-Olshansky, marketing and admissions manager. ''Two people sharing an apartment can be married, unmarried, same gender, man and woman, or parent and grown child,'' she said. 
 Tower East, built in 1982, admits only residents eligible for HUD Section 8 rental assistance. Tenants pay up to 30 percent of income, which cannot exceed $20,500 for an individual or $22,400 for two people. There are 144 one-bedroom apartments at $1,312 and six apartments with two bedrooms at $1,457. Residents have access to all the amenities and assisted living services available at Tower One except meals, which are not included in their rent but can be purchased (a three-course dinner is $12.95). Air-conditioning and electricity are also paid for by the tenant.
 A second project in Connecticut to apply for and receive a HUD grant, Immanuel House at 15 Woodland Street in Hartford, has been housing older people for 33 years in 204 studio and one-bedroom apartments. ''We serve a wider range of tenants than Tower One/Tower East,'' said Deborah Winzell, executive director of Immanuel House. ''We have very-low-income Section 8 tenants paying as little as $25 a month to others paying $600.'' 
 Construction has begun to convert 42 units on two floors, and renovations are in process in common lounge areas and the kitchen and dining room, which serves three meals a day, seven days a week.
 A THIRD development seeking to join the program, Juniper Hill Village at 1 Silo Circle in Storrs, which began as a HUD-financed moderate-income residence for older people, has become home to people of very low to low income. ''We started assisted living a year ago,'' said the director, Marsha Zimmer, ''delivering 20 hours of nursing seven days a week, personal care and housekeeping, and three meals a day.'' Rents at 30 percent of income can be less than $100 and run up to $600 a month. 
 Of the 100 apartments, five have two bedrooms, and the rest have one. Juniper Hill's application for a grant is in the processing stage, and approval is expected this year. Eight apartments are to be renovated. 
 All three residences were founded by Jewish or Christian groups, but over time as they came to rely on federal and state support, they became nondenominational. Tower One/Tower East today is a veritable United Nations of races, religions and ethnicities.
 It still keeps kosher with the requisite two kitchens -- one for meat, one for dairy -- but it has a chef manager, David Schwartzenberg, who has made it his mission to adapt kosher cooking principles to a surprising variety of dishes, including those for Hanukkah, Christmas, Three Kings Day, Chinese New Year and Kwanzaa.

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Productivity and Jobs: The Political Vagaries'' (Economic View, March 7), which described the arguments over how much productivity growth is good for the economy: 
 The rate of job growth in the United States economy will no doubt continue to be an important issue in this year's election. It may even decide the winner in the race for president - particularly if the results in states like Ohio make the difference.
 The negative effects of a jobless recovery cannot be attributed solely to factors like the outsourcing of jobs overseas. We must also understand the apparently profound impacts of our own sustained improvements in national productivity. 
 Innovation, creativity, and competition produced these vital changes in our national ability to create value. Which candidate will articulate a plan to build on these strengths while mitigating the negative effects of a new global economic equilibrium?

 BODY:
There was a time when making it as a ballplayer in the Dominican Republic required not just talent but also superhuman effort and ingenuity. In Rob Ruck's informative history ''The Tropic of Baseball,'' the catcher Tony Pena, who grew up in Palo Verde in the late 1960's and early 70's, remembers having to make his own mitt out of cardboard and his own ball out of rubber salvaged from old tires. To sharpen his skills, he improvised ways to make the game even more difficult: ''We took the seed from the guasima tree, and Ramon'' -- his brother -- ''pitched that to me instead of a ball, so I could learn to hit fastballs better,'' he says. ''For curves, he threw me bottle caps.''
 That may not have been too good for Ramon's arm -- he had the proverbial cup of coffee in the major leagues, 18 forgettable innings for the Detroit Tigers in 1989 -- but things worked out well for Tony. He lasted 17 seasons in the majors, made the all-star team five times and played in two World Series. He now manages the Kansas City Royals. 
 Though Pena's story is only a generation old, conditions in the D.R. have changed considerably. Today, few kids have to make their own mitts, and there are plenty of regulation major-league baseballs to go around. But stories like Pena's nourish an extraordinary cultural phenomenon. The tiny Caribbean nation of 8.7 million now supplies about one of every four professional ballplayers in the United States (including minor leaguers). Any boy who shows the slightest potential for greatness is swept up into a system designed to maximize his talents and usher him into the clutches of professional baseball in the United States. Every major league team has scouts all over the D.R., and some operate their own academies, where teenagers live and breathe baseball as much as 10 months a year. (Some critics call this exploitation, but the practice continues.) Last December, the Boston Red Sox unveiled a new $3 million complex, where the team hopes to develop arms as golden as that of its Dominican-born ace Pedro Martinez and bats as mighty as that of its Dominican-born slugger Manny Ramirez.
 The country's ability to produce so many great baseball players can be compared to Romania's record of turning out Gold Medal gymnasts or, to pick a lesser-known, less wholesome example, the Philippines' capacity for making the world's most unbeatable pool hustlers. These relatively impoverished, often overlooked countries combine just the right balance of dream and deprivation. For Romania, long smothered culturally and economically by the Soviet Union, gymnastics was how the country showed its strength and individuality: every girl grew up dreaming of being the next Nadia Comaneci.
 In the Philippines, pool is a source of masculine identity, and, as The Wall Street Journal recently noted, the tables in the slums of Manila are so terrible that the simplest shots require tremendous skill. In this way, deprivation produces greatness, just as it did when the young Tony Pena was trying to hit bottle caps.
The Dominican Republic's fixation on baseball is not unusual in the Caribbean. After learning the game from American sailors, Cuba became the first baseball power in the region, and Puerto Rico has always produced a good share of players, including the Hall of Famer Roberto Clemente. But nowhere else do the roots run quite so thick and deep. The game arrived on the island in the late 1860's, imported by Cubans fleeing from a war. Back then, the favorite sports of the Caribbean were dictated by the colonial powers. Haiti, which shares the island of Hispaniola with the Dominican Republic, was under French rule, and so the Haitians played soccer. In the British West Indies, cricket was the dominant game.
 The Dominican Republic was originally colonized by Spain, but by the dawn of the 20th century, the Dominicans were developing closer ties to the United States. From the Dominican side of the bargain, it has been a long love-hate relationship. The Dominicans hated Americans for their bullying ways (notably the Marines' occupation of the country from 1916 to 1924) and for their fruit conglomerates that sometimes acted as if they were above the law.
 But the Dominicans loved the great American pastime, and through the years, as the country suffered economic upheavals and the long rule of the dictator Rafael Trujillo, the game provided a steady and reliable reprieve, a kind of social glue. It created heroes and gave young boys something to dream about and aspire to.
 After being one of the economic success stories of Latin America in the 1990's, the Dominican Republic is seeing bad times again. The economy is faltering, and the government is fending off charges of corruption. But baseball is, as it always has been in the Dominican Republic, a separate institution, and it is flourishing. If you're a teenager in Palo Verde or San Pedro de Macoris, there is still nothing you'd rather be doing than playing ball, and that is not necessarily how it is anywhere else in the world. While the United States grooms the greatest generation of Xbox players ever seen, they're still making tomorrow's shortstops in the D.R.

PERSON: William F. Browder

HEADLINE: An Investor and Gadfly in Russia

BYLINE: By ERIN E. ARVEDLUND

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
WILLIAM F. BROWDER, an investor who is shaking up Russia's financial world by attacking its economic oligarchs, has come under the influence of a diverse cast of larger-than-life characters over the years.
 There was his grandfather Earl R. Browder, the Stalinist boss of the American Communist Party from 1932 to 1945, who died in 1974, when William was 9. ''All he was to me was Grandpa, the guy smelling of pipe smoke,'' said Mr. Browder, who was born in the United States and emigrated to Britain. But the elder Mr. Browder also impressed his grandson as a man of principle and an advocate for the little guy. 
 Decades later, the grandson has become a self-described crusader for shareholders' rights, filing lawsuits that seek to force Russian companies to open up their books and cede some control. He says he honed his confrontational style with the help of another mentor, Edmond J. Safra, the multibillionaire founder of Republic National Bank in New York. 
 In vivid contrast to Mr. Browder's far-left forebear, Mr. Safra was the ubercapitalist who befriended him and bankrolled the Hermitage Fund, the hedge fund that Mr. Browder opened in 1996. It is now one of the largest hedge funds dedicated to Russia, with $1.4 billion in assets.
 Mr. Safra, who died in 1999, gave him more than money, Mr. Browder said; he gave him attitude. ''Why create controversy? Because the people whose interests I'm maximizing are my clients, the investors in my fund,'' Mr. Browder said. ''I learned that from Safra.''
 Finally, there is Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, whom critics accuse of locking down the free press and bringing back de facto one-party rule. Mr. Putin, who is expected to win overwhelmingly in the Russian election today, is increasingly perceived as authoritarian. 
 But ''we want an authoritarian -- one who is exercising authority over mafia and oligarchs,'' Mr. Browder said, adding that Mr. Putin ''has turned out to be my biggest ally in Russia.''
 ''It's an exaggeration that there's no free press here,'' he said. ''The press may not be free to criticize Putin, but anyone else, they can.''
 It is an advantage to count a national leader in your corner, of course, especially if you have a lot of powerful enemies. And Mr. Browder has plenty. ''I fight Russian companies,'' he boasted, by pushing them to open up their books, to use cash to pay higher dividends and to give equal representation to outside shareholders. 
 In the 1990's, he picked a fight with an oligarch, Vladimir Potanin, over Sidanco, an oil company, concerning a share issue that would have diluted minority holdings. Russian securities officials canceled the disputed share issue, saving the Hermitage Fund alone $63 million.
 ''More or less everybody hates me,'' he said, rattling off a list of people and companies who have been targets of his shareholder battles, including Anatoly B. Chubais, chairman and chief executive of UES, the Russian electricity monopoly; Rem I. Vyakhirev, the former chairman of Gazprom, the Russian natural-gas monopoly; and the American accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. ''But I'm not here to be liked.'' 
 Mr. Browder does not wage all his battles alone. His latest effort -- a lawsuit filed this month in a Siberian regional court against Surgutneftegas, Russia's fourth-largest oil company -- was filed jointly with Russia's Investor Protection Association and a large group of Surgutneftegas minority shareholders, including two other hedge funds, Prosperity Capital, based in Moscow, and the Firebird Fund, based in New York. 
 They contend that Surgutneftegas executives have entrenched themselves and unfairly control about 62 percent of voting shares through various murky subsidiaries. They also contend that the oil company pays a miserly dividend compared with those of its larger Russian rivals, Lukoil, Yukos and Sibneft. Surgutneftegas pays out 1 percent of its net income per share in dividends, versus 94 percent for Sibneft, 28 percent for Lukoil and 23 percent for Yukos.
 A court ruling in the shareholder group's favor could pay off handsomely. But the suit has also set the stage for a protracted legal battle with Surgutneftegas, an oil giant that is loyal to the Kremlin, treats its employees relatively well and pays big taxes. 
 A Surgutneftegas spokeswoman, Raisa Khodchenko, declined to comment on the suit, saying that no one at the company had seen or read it.
 A few analysts hailed Mr. Browder's suit, saying that some complaints against Surgutneftegas -- including contentions that the company's accounting rules understate net income, and thus, dividends -- were widely shared among investors. But the investors' chances are slim, even after joining forces. Prosperity Capital filed a similar suit against Surgutneftegas three years ago and lost. 
 ''There is no precedent in Russia for a similar suit succeeding,'' said Steven Dashevsky of Aton Capital, a brokerage firm based in Moscow. 
 Mr. Dashevsky also said that Surgutneftegas's president and general director, Vladimir L. Bogdanov, is a local hero in the company's remote region of Khanty-Mansiysk, and ''the likelihood of a court there removing him from control of a company that is an excellent corporate citizen is next to nil.'' Moreover, he said, the suit would require Surgutneftegas to unwind a share arrangement like those used by other powerful Russian companies. 
 Nevertheless, under Mr. Putin, the cold climate for lawsuits of this kind may be warming up. A deputy in the Russian Parliament is pushing through a bill that would force Russian companies to calculate dividends based on a standard definition of net income, a change that would address one accusation leveled at Surgutneftegas. 
 ''Under Putin, the political winds have shifted in favor of investors, even if only at the margins,'' said Ian Hague, a partner at the Firebird Fund. ''This puts to the test Putin's promise to level the playing field for investors. And that includes Surgut, which should be doing what every other Russian oil company does -- paying dividends and declaring the proper net income.''
 ALTHOUGH Mr. Browder's conflicts may have made him few friends here, they have paid off in financial terms, by protecting the fund's investments and by driving up prices of shares it holds. The Hermitage Fund had a return of 67 percent in 2003, and has returned 33 percent, annualized, since its inception. 
 Mr. Browder says he is confident that he will prevail in his latest legal challenge. ''We'll take it all the way to the top,'' to the Constitutional Court of Russia, he declared.
 As for his personal politics, Mr. Browder says he is ''not a Communist'' like his grandfather. He's a longtime supporter of the Democratic Party in the United States. When he does argue politics with American relatives, he said, ''the one thing we all agree on is that we have to get rid of George Bush.''

HEADLINE: Balky Old New York Goes High-Tech, Using Gadgets to Improve Services

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
It may not seem like much, but at $34 a ton, even ordinary street salt can break a budget in a city that slathers 300,000 tons a year on its roadways. So New York's Sanitation Department dispatched a new generation of salt spreaders this winter, loaded with satellite tracking devices and sensors that can measure precisely how much salt is dropped per mile and report back when there is any waste.
 Similarly, city environmental officials are using technology to conserve their resources in monitoring the city's reservoir system in upstate New York. Last year, they deployed their version of the Mars rover -- known as R.U.S.S., for Remote Underwater Surveillance System -- to take readings once done by inspectors in boats.
 The Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications is also rolling out an interactive three-dimensional map of the entire cityscape this spring that could someday all but eliminate the need for on-site surveys. It is expected to be used for everything from collecting property taxes to bolstering security at big events to developing architectural plans for the city's 2012 Olympic bid. 
 This is all part of a technological revolution under way in New York City government that is rapidly changing the way that its agencies carry out their functions and provide services to residents. From rationing street salt to sending out daily e-mail messages on parking rules, once-lumbering bureaucracies are adopting the latest scientific advances as a means of cutting costs, increasing efficiency as well as ensuring greater accountability after a series of corporate and government corruption scandals.
 Many of these changes have been promoted by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, whose pet project last year was the creation of a 311 hotline to centralize information about city services and take complaints from residents at the touch of a button. 
 Under the Bloomberg administration, spending on technology across all city agencies has risen steadily to an estimated $1 billion this year, even as spending in other areas has been trimmed. The move to modernize is also part of a larger trend, one that many cities, long known for their dusty ways, are embracing.
 William Lehr, a research associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said that since the late 1990's, municipal governments, large and small, have been rushing to take advantage of what he described as a convergence of better and cheaper technologies.
 ''You don't have to be the C.I.A. or General Motors or Boeing to take advantage of computing and information technology anymore,'' he said. ''Cheap computing, the Internet and wireless data services now make these capabilities available to small businesses, local governments and consumers.''
 Mayor Bloomberg and his commissioners view technology as an essential component for improving governmental operations, whether that means consolidating and updating database systems or introducing sophisticated gadgets like hand-held computers and satellite-tracking devices. ''I have always believed, if used correctly, technology makes people more efficient,'' Mayor Bloomberg said in an interview. ''It does not replace people. In the end, it's in their interests.''
 But the new technology is also meeting resistance from critics who question the high start-up costs, and from some city workers who said they experienced glitches in the transition. Last month, for instance, the Buildings Department started using mapping technology that was supposed to schedule plumbing inspections more efficiently, by grouping the appointments together by location. However, some inspectors were initially bounced from the East Side to the West Side and back.
 ''That was certainly one of the rough spots,'' said Mark H. Topping, a deputy buildings commissioner, adding that the system is now running smoothly. The new technology, with its seemingly boundless capabilities, has also raised concerns about privacy. Norman Siegel, a civil rights lawyer, said employers will increasingly be able to keep tabs on workers at any moment, even during lunch hours or on weekends. ''It's going to raise serious and substantial issues about privacy for city workers as this technology is employed in the workplace,'' he said.
 But others believe that the Big-Brother elements of the technology will have little practical effect. Harry Nespoli, president of the Uniformed Sanitationmen's Association, which represents 6,000 city sanitation workers, said the satellite-tracking devices in the salt spreaders were meant to enhance communications within the department and, in that sense, were no different from the radios already in place.
 ''All it's going to do is confirm what I've been saying all along, that we move snow,'' Mr. Nespoli said.
 Each of the 27 salt spreaders purchased by the Sanitation Department in December comes with a black box, which contains a Global Positioning System receiver for picking up satellites signals to pinpoint the spreader's location, and sensors that record air and ground temperatures and monitor salt output.
 The salt spreaders, which cost a total of $4.2 million, automatically relay all this information to a centralized database, which is watched closely by sanitation officials during blizzards. In January, the system showed that two salt spreaders, in the Bronx and in Queens, were dispensing nearly twice as much salt as was needed. Officials radioed the drivers, and the settings were adjusted.
 ''The idea is to build a better piece of equipment and be more productive,'' said Commissioner John J. Doherty, who next plans to put satellite tracking in garbage trucks.
 While satellite tracking devices are hardly cutting edge -- they have long been used by hikers and boaters -- the technology has been slow to catch on in New York City because all the skyscrapers can block or distort signals from satellites in what engineers call an ''urban canyon effect.'' Such problems prevented the New York City Transit from installing satellite tracking in its buses in the late 1990's. Transit officials said this week that they have hired a consultant to move forward with plans to place the tracking devices in its 4,500 buses, as well as in vans used to transport the disabled.
 Gino P. Menchini, commissioner of the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications, said that tracking technology has improved so much that the city is now studying a host of uses for it, including in police cars and ambulances, and even taxis. In addition, his department has been testing wireless communications.
 They also have been building elaborate three-dimensional maps of the city, starting with skyscrapers and moving down to subways. The maps will correspond to a vast bank of information, including police precincts and building inspection records.
 ''I think there's more real practical business technologies occurring now than anytime in the city's history,'' Mr. Menchini said. ''In general, if I had to take our mass of technology projects and sort of put it on a scale, I'd say in regard to other large cities, we're probably ahead of the vast majority of them.'' 
 One of the more sophisticated technology experiments is unfolding at the Department of Environmental Protection, which deployed three Y-shaped robots to float on the Schoharie Reservoir at a cost of $180,000. Each robot, which is powered by solar panels, has a probe that can be lowered into the water to take temperature and pH readings. In addition, the probe tests for chemical and biological pollutants as part of an early warning system for terrorist and security threats.
 In other cases, the technological improvements have sped up, and streamlined, long-held practices. For example, the Health Department's food service inspectors have switched over to hand-held Acer computers for reporting findings that were once recorded on paper forms, and then manually typed into a database -- a process that could take days and was often fraught with errors. The papers were then preserved on microfilm at an additional cost of $100,000 a year.
 Elliott S. Marcus, an assistant health commissioner, said that inspectors now enter their findings with a few keystrokes, and download that directly into a database, eliminating the need for data entry and microfilming altogether. ''Instead of spending two and a half hours on a restaurant, now we can spend two,'' he said.
 Marsha Beecher, a senior health inspector who started using the computer in 2002, said that using the new technology has kept her more focused on her job and sped up the inspection process. ''Not everyone likes change, but I think the majority wanted it,'' she said. 
 ''It's more professional looking,'' she said. ''It gives us more of a sense that we know what we're doing.''
 Some city agencies have also turned to technology to make their operations more open to scrutiny, and safeguard against embarrassing lapses. For instance, the Buildings Department spent more than $800,000 to include hand-held computers, satellite tracking devices and electronic records in its inspection process after 19 plumbing inspectors were arrested in a bribery scandal.
 The program, known as Pipes -- Plumbing Inspection Portable Entry System -- uses mapping technology to schedule appointments and track inspectors throughout the day for better planning and accountability. ''Our goal is not to track every plumbing inspector everywhere they go, it's to improve the system,'' Mr. Topping said.
 The new technology has largely drawn praise from council members and government oversight groups, who say that it is making more information available about city services than ever before. ''You wouldn't find out this kind of information in the past,'' said Gene Russianoff, a senior attorney for the New York Public Interest Research Group. ''You'd have to call each one of these agencies, and they'd tell you the data wasn't available, or it wasn't broken down that way, or click.''
 Councilwoman Gale Brewer, chairwoman of the Technology in Government Committee, said that while she supported satellite-tracking devices and hand-held computers, she would like to see even more investment in consumer-oriented technology that could be shared across agencies.
 ''I think some of these gadgets are fine, but that's not the whole story,'' she said. ''We are still very far in terms of providing consumer services, where you can actually do things online instead of in line.''

HEADLINE: Investors, Do Not Try This at Home

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM

 BODY:
FOR the second consecutive year, Warren E. Buffett has used his annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholder letter to take aim at the mutual fund industry. This time, he has criticized what he calls the ''lapdog behavior'' of fund directors, whose job it is to look after investor interests by overseeing the selection and performance of fund managers.
 Yet Mr. Buffett's criticism of fund directors, which received much attention from the news media after he posted the letter on the Berkshire Web site on March 6, raises a question: How is Mr. Buffett, perhaps the world's most famous investor, doing in his capacity as a de facto fund manager? And what lessons, if any, can individual investors draw from what he has done lately with his company's equity portfolio?
 The most immediate lesson from Mr. Buffett, 73, the plain-spoken master of value investing, is patience. When it comes to stocks, he is the anti-market timer. Last year, the market soared and investors poured money into stocks. Recently, however, stocks have taken a pounding -- the Dow dropped 3.4 percent last week -- and many investors are fretting. Through all of this, Mr. Buffett has barely altered his core portfolio. In his letter, he noted a ''shortage of attractively priced stocks in which we can put large sums'' and said he would rather earn very little in cash than do ''something stupid'' with the money. 
 Though Berkshire Hathaway is an amalgam of insurance companies, like Geico and General Re, and dozens of other businesses including Ben Bridge Jeweler, Fruit of the Loom and See's Candies, it still invests a big chunk of assets in publicly traded stocks -- through a variety of its entities. These stock investments, which are revealed quarterly in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, were about one-fourth of Berkshire's total asset allocation last year, according to an analysis by Haywood Kelly, chief of securities analysis at Morningstar Inc. That is down from more than half in 1998, when wholly owned companies were a much smaller part of Berkshire.
 STILL, with around $35 billion invested in publicly traded stocks at the end of 2003, Berkshire Hathaway's equity portfolio, if seen as a mutual fund, would be the 10th-largest stock fund in the country, according to Morningstar. It would be the sixth-largest actively managed United States equity portfolio, just behind Fidelity Contrafund and ahead of the Dodge & Cox Stock fund. 
 While Berkshire stock has beaten the market for decades, outsiders cannot calculate precisely the performance of the company's stock portfolio because S.E.C. filings do not indicate when, or at what price, each stock was bought. If all the stocks listed in its most recent filings had been owned for the 12 months through February, the portfolio would have outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index by more than four percentage points, according to Morningstar. 
 Berkshire's team -- Mr. Buffett, the chairman; Charles T. Munger, the vice chairman; and Lou Simpson, who oversees Geico's investments -- manages money in ways that are strikingly different from those of a typical stock fund. For starters, unlike many mutual fund managers, Mr. Buffett is quick to note mistakes that he has made with his investors' money. In his most recent letter to shareholders, he bemoaned the fact that he did not sell some of his top holdings in recent years.
 Hanging on to a single stock for too long can have a larger impact at Berkshire than it does at the average domestic stock fund, which invests in 169 companies. Berkshire, by contrast, held just 29 stocks at the end of 2003, not including the companies it owned outright, according to its most recent S.E.C. filing. (That filing included companies for which Berkshire owned some American shares; in an amended S.E.C. filing, on Feb. 17, Berkshire indicated that it also owned shares of Cadbury Schweppes, which trade on the London Stock Exchange.)
 At first blush, Mr. Buffett's lament over not selling seems at odds with his reputation as a value manager who avoids risk by buying stocks in solid companies and holding them for a lifetime. But concentrating on a few dozen stocks fits into Mr. Buffett's strategy of investing only in companies about which he feels absolutely comfortable, and knowledgeable. He has said that his love of sweets, for example, led him to an intimate knowledge of Dairy Queen, See's Candies and Coca-Cola. He invested in the companies after poring through their financial records and chatting with their executives. 
 In general, Mr. Buffett's bets have paid off. 
 This contributed to Berkshire's solid performance last year. He said in the letter that the net worth of the company grew by $13.6 billion in 2003, which increased Berkshire's book value per share by 21 percent.
 Berkshire's stock has returned 36.9 percent in the last 12 months, lagging behind the S. &P. 500 by 4.9 percentage points. But from 1969 through last year, the stock had an amazing annualized growth rate of 24.8 percent, according to Standard & Poor's, versus the 10.6 percent, annualized, return for the S.&P. 500. Such results make it easy to see why Mr. Buffett, whom Forbes magazine lists as the world's second-wealthiest man, after Bill Gates, is considered among the most successful money managers in history.
 The fact that Mr. Buffett did not add many stocks to Berkshire's portfolio is attributable to two factors, analysts say: First, as Mr. Buffett said in his letter, he is having a tougher time finding undervalued stocks in the United States. He has said that when valuations in the private and public equity markets are similar, ''we strongly prefer owning businesses to owning stocks.''
 But beyond this short-term consideration, investors in Berkshire Hathaway must understand that Mr. Buffett has always ''been willing to step up to the plate and take big positions'' in certain stocks, if he trusts the underlying businesses, said William Fiala, an analyst at Edward Jones.
 Contrary to popular opinion, ''he does not believe in diversification, he believes in concentration,'' said Jean-Marie Eveillard, co-manager of the First Eagle Global fund. It owns 815 shares of Berkshire's Class A stock, which now trade for $92,150 each. ''He believes that a few carefully chosen eggs in one basket is fine,'' Mr. Eveillard added, ''as long as they are carefully chosen.''
 AN assistant said last week that Mr. Buffett was not available for an interview, but that he would answer questions on May 1, at his annual shareholders' meeting in Omaha. Those meetings have resembled country fairs in which the avuncular Mr. Buffett plays host to barbecues, baseball and bridge games, and informal investment tutorials. For one weekend every year, his acolytes have transformed Omaha into a mecca for value investors. 
 But Mr. Eveillard, himself a respected value manager, warns investors that Mr. Buffett's style of equity investing cannot easily be replicated. ''Unless you're as smart as Warren Buffett, you should be very careful with concentration,'' he said. 
 Berkshire's equity holdings are even more concentrated than is apparent at first glance, said Steven Check, chief investment officer at Check Capital Management, an investment advisory business in Costa Mesa, Calif., that owns roughly $22.8 million in Berkshire stock. For instance, more than 80 percent of Mr. Buffett's holdings were in stocks in just three economic sectors: financial services, consumer goods and energy.
 Moreover, his top 10 holdings accounted for nearly 90 percent of the portfolio's assets. Those stocks were Coca-Cola, American Express, Gillette, Wells Fargo, Moody's, the Washington Post Company, PetroChina, H&R Block, HCA and Wesco Financial. Mr. Munger, the vice chairman of Berkshire, is the chairman of Wesco, which is also a holding company with assets in insurance and in an eclectic group of businesses like furniture rental.
 By comparison, the average domestic equity fund holds a third of its assets in its top 10 names, while the 10 largest United States stock funds hold only around a quarter of their assets in their top picks.
 Despite Mr. Buffett's willingness to make big bets on a handful of stocks, he acknowledged in the letter that ''I made a big mistake in not selling several of our larger holdings during the great bubble.'' While he did not name which stocks he should have sold, Mr. Eveillard said that ''Coke and Gillette would be the obvious guesses.'' 
 At the end of 2000 Berkshire's 200 million shares of Coca-Cola were worth $12.2 billion. By Dec. 31, 2002, the market value of those shares had fallen to $8.8 billion in the bear market, an annualized loss of 15.1 percent, compared with an annualized decline of 18.3 percent for the S. &P. 500. Though shares of Coke and Gillette have since improved, analysts agreed that Mr. Buffett should have sold those shares in recent years, as he sold other positions including the Walt Disney Company and Freddie Mac.
 Because Mr. Buffett bought many of his top holdings long before the bear market, his company has still had sizable gains in those positions. He said in his annual report that Berkshire had paid $1.3 billion for its stake in Coca-Cola. Last week, those shares were worth more than $10 billion.
 ''You can think of it this way: The S.&P. 500 has gone up somewhere around three times since 1990,'' says Dreyfus Neenan, an analyst at Morningstar. ''Buffett's Coca-Cola stock is worth around eight times what he paid for them. His American Express stock is worth four or five times what he paid for them. His Wells Fargo stake is probably up seven times what he paid for it.''
 Mr. Buffett said the last time he changed his position in American Express was in 1998; the last time he changed his Coca-Cola investment was in 1994; and the last time he altered his Gillette position was in 1989. That does not mean, however, that Berkshire does not occasionally tweak its equity holdings or other investments. He said in the letter, for example, that he has become ''increasingly bearish on the dollar,'' and, at year-end, was making a $12 billion bet against the currency.
 And, according to S.E.C. filings, Berkshire made some changes in its stock portfolio. It sold its positions in a handful of stocks in 2003, including Best Buy, the consumer electronics retailer; Jones Apparel Group, the apparel manufacturer; PNC Financial Services Group, the regional bank; and Great Lakes Chemical, a specialty chemicals manufacturer.
 BERKSHIRE opened a position in HCA, the hospital company that Mr. Check says is a ''typical Buffett company -- with good cash flow and trading at attractive valuations when he bought it.''
 Perhaps the most intriguing -- and most telling -- addition to the Berkshire portfolio was PetroChina, the integrated oil and natural-gas company that operates 29 refineries in China. At the end of 2003, Berkshire's shares in PetroChina were worth more than $1.3 billion, nearly three times what the company paid for them. (Most of that investment traded in Hong Kong, while the rest was in American depository receipts.)
 In fact, PetroChina stands out in Mr. Buffett's portfolio. Its shares tripled in 2003, as investors bid up shares of many stocks that stand to benefit from China's economic growth. That type of spike is not what would be expected in a steady-as-she goes Buffett stock. ''This is a long way from home for a guy who doesn't traditionally invest overseas,'' Mr. Neenan said.
 But that may be an indication of how hard it has been recently for Mr. Buffett to find undervalued large-capitalization stocks in the United States market, Mr. Neenan said.
 Of course, Mr. Buffett's complaint about the lack of good stocks at good prices does not mean that he will not put new money to work in 2004. In fact, longtime investors of Berkshire Hathaway will recall that in a letter to shareholders in 1989, Mr. Buffett said the stock market was less attractive than it had been for the last 24 years. Yet, later that year, he increased his holdings in Coca-Cola by 60 percent. 
 ''I would challenge anyone,'' Mr. Check said, ''to find a single report where he says it's easy to find equities to buy.''

HEADLINE: A Tug of War Over 'Stupid White Men'

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR

 BODY:
Next week, a tiny Brooklyn-based publisher will bring out ''How to Get Stupid White Men Out of Office.'' The book, a low-budget paperback written by a group of political activists, is not to be confused with ''Stupid White Men,'' a HarperCollins best seller by the filmmaker and author Michael Moore, which remains in hardcover.
 But HarperCollins has been concerned about just that sort of confusion. In November, HarperCollins wrote to the Brooklyn publisher, Soft Skull Press, demanding that the title be changed and stating that the similarities would cause ''irreparable damage'' to Mr. Moore and his book. 
 The ironies compound rather quickly at this point, even ignoring that a company built on free and unfettered expression appears to be, by implication, objecting when someone else engages in that. In sending the letter, HarperCollins was protecting a book it refused to publish for a time, defending an author it fought bitterly with, and, according to Mr. Moore, doing so without his knowledge.
 When called about the letter and the implied legal threat, a spokeswoman said that the publisher planned no further action against Soft Skull Press over ''How to Get Stupid White Men Out of Office,'' which was written and edited by William Upski Wimsatt, among many others. 
 HarperCollins has always had a hard time making up its mind about ''Stupid White Men,'' a jeremiad against the Bush administration that was originally scheduled to be released on Sept. 11, 2001. HarperCollins delayed the release because of the sensitivities created by the terrorist attacks, and, according to Mr. Moore, asked for significant changes in tone and content. 
 The book was finally released in 2002 after a group of librarians organized a protest and threatened to boycott the publisher, according to Mr. Moore. The book became a big nonfiction success, selling more than a million copies, but Mr. Moore said he was embittered by the experience and moved to Warner Books. Mr. Moore says he has not spoken to anyone at HarperCollins for two years.
 ''It is kind of strange that a publisher that first tried to squash my book is now trying to defend their economic interest now that it is a best seller,'' he said. ''And they are apparently doing it by trying to squash another book.''
 A spokeswoman for HarperCollins, which is owned by the News Corporation, said no squashing was in the offing.
 ''We were concerned that there would be confusion, and we brought that to the attention of the publisher and that was the end of it,'' the spokeswoman, Lisa Herling, said. 
 In the HarperCollins' letter to Soft Skull Press, the publisher said, ''Michael Moore has become closely identified with the phrase 'Stupid White Men' in the minds of the general public.''
 ''Accordingly, we demand that you eliminate the phrase 'Stupid White Men' from the title of Mr. Wimsatt's book prior to its publication,'' said the letter, from Beth Neelman Silfin, vice president and associate general counsel of HarperCollins. ''Please confirm to me, in writing that you will take this important and necessary step to avoid confusion between the two books.''
 Richard E. Nash, the publisher of Soft Skull Press, said he thought the letter was hilariously menacing.
 ''The reason that I have neither ceased nor desisted is that they have no case,'' Mr. Nash said. ''Besides, I have strong opinions about the current trends in copyright and trademark laws. There is a huge land grab going on by big corporations.''
 Robert D. Lystad, of the Baker & Hostetler law firm in Washington, said that he had not seen a land grab but had noticed a trend toward a more spirited defense of intellectual property.
 ''Publishers, like other business, are aggressively pursuing protection for any aspect of their products that they believe imparts value,'' he said, adding, ''catchy titles impart value.'' 
 In his written response to HarperCollins, Mr. Nash pointed to a case brought last summer by the Fox News Channel, another division of News Corporation. Fox News had sought an injunction against the comedian Al Franken over the title of his book, ''Lies, and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right,'' arguing that his use of the term ''fair and balanced'' would lead to consumer confusion. But Judge Denny Chin of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York said someone would have to be ''completely dense'' not to get the joke implied by the cover.
 Mr. Franken said that the two issues were not precisely the same.
 ''The Fox case was wholly without merit,'' he said. ''This one seems a little tougher because I was doing a book that was commenting on Fox. It was satire. This book sounds sort of similar to Michael Moore's.''
 Few would mistake ''How to Get Stupid White Men Out of Office'' for a potential best seller. With a dozen authors and editors on the cover and a relentless focus on nuts-and-bolts electoral tactics and case studies, it is far from a breezy bit of Bush-bashing.
 ''I think that this is one of those big, dumb, paranoid intellectual property gambits,'' Mr. Nash said. ''They send out these big cease-and-desist letters to anything that moves.''
 In this case, the prospects for a legal remedy might be slim.
 ''The fact that Mr. Moore and his publishers have been lucky enough to coin a phrase doesn't mean they get a monopoly over its use,'' said Kevin W. Goering, a media and publishing lawyer at Coudert Brothers, a Manhattan law firm. ''Any legal action would be very speculative at best.'' Mr. Goering added that book titles are not generally subject to copyright laws. 
 Mr. Moore -- whose current best seller, ''Dude, Where's My Country?'' does some borrowing of its own from the movie ''Dude, Where's My Car,'' -- says he does not object to the latest iteration of ''Stupid White Men,'' as long as there is no confusion about who wrote it.
 ''I bumped into somebody that was working on the project a few months ago and said it is important that the public not think that it was a book by me,'' he said. ''But I am flattered that somebody would take something that I did and use it to create change.''

HEADLINE: Companies Aiding Internet Gambling Feel U.S. Pressure

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL

 BODY:
Federal prosecutors have begun a wide-ranging effort to curb the growing popularity of online gambling in the United States by quietly threatening legal action against American companies that do business with Internet casinos and sports betting operations based outside the country, lawyers and industry executives say.
 The investigation into the activities of media, public relations and technology companies relies on a controversial legal concept that holds that the American businesses, by providing advertising and other services that support Internet gambling, are ''aiding and abetting'' online casinos. That gives prosecutors an indirect way to attack the overseas enterprises, whose operations are illegal here but fall outside their jurisdiction.
 Lawyers said they were not aware of any charges that had been filed. Still, the campaign, which has gone on for months, has already chalked up some significant nonlegal victories. Several big media operations -- including Infinity Broadcasting, Clear Channel Communications and the Discovery Networks -- stopped running advertisements for offshore Internet casinos last fall in light of the threat of further scrutiny that might lead to prosecution. 
 The investigation of the Internet gambling industry, lawyers said, is being run by Raymond W. Gruender, the United States attorney in the Eastern District of Missouri. His office convened a grand jury last year in St. Louis that has issued summonses to a number of companies and individuals, including Sebastian Sinclair, a market researcher who provides economic analyses of the online gambling industry.
 Mr. Sinclair said he received a subpoena at the end of February. He said it required him to testify before the federal grand jury next month. 
 The investigation comes as millions of Americans have turned to their home computers to place sports bets and play casino games. Using credit cards or other electronic payment methods, players can place wagers with the Internet casinos, most of them in Costa Rica, the Caribbean or the Isle of Man, between Ireland and Britain.
 In trying to crack down on Internet gambling through American companies that provide support services, particularly advertising and marketing, the government may find itself on shaky legal ground, the industry, its lawyers and some independent legal analysts say. 
 The reason, analysts say, is that broadcasters and marketers could well be within their First Amendment rights in advertising on behalf of Internet casinos.
 But others say prosecutors may be able to develop a sound case on the ground that American companies are profiting from the success of Internet casinos, a plainly illegal enterprise in the United States.
 Even though the legal issues have not been resolved, the inquiry is already achieving some of its goals merely by raising questions.
 ''The government has floated these legal theories without having to prove anything,'' said Lawrence G. Walters, a Florida lawyer who specializes in Internet gambling law. ''But they've achieved their end result: scaring the players and the industry.''
 Mr. Gruender, the United States attorney in St. Louis, declined to comment. His office referred inquiries to Justice Department officials in Washington. They also would not comment, saying the department does not discuss any potential or active investigation. 
 Broadcasters are already under scrutiny from regulators and legislators who are seeking to establish new standards regarding obscenity. Recently, Clear Channel, which operates the nation's largest chain of radio stations, stopped carrying the Howard Stern show in six cities. 
 The investigation also underscores the complex legal and political issues raised by the borderless Internet. The overseas casino operations are legal and licensed in the jurisdictions where they are based, permitting them to reach through the Web to customers in the United States, where federal and state laws forbid the operation of unlicensed casinos.
 David Carruthers, chief executive of BetonSports.com, an online sports betting business based in Costa Rica, said he was licensed in that country, as well as in Antigua, the Dominican Republic and Britain. His company alone, he said, has 1.2 million registered American users and accepted 33 million bets from North America last year, the vast majority from the United States.
 He said his advertisements had been banned recently from, among other places, the Howard Stern show, which is produced by Infinity Broadcasting, a unit of Viacom.
 Media companies are ''being held hostage,'' Mr. Carruthers complained. ''Unless they stand up, they're going to lose millions in dollars from the advertising.''
 As recently as last September, Mr. Carruthers also advertised BetonSports.com on city buses in New York. But Viacom Outdoor, which placed the ads, no longer accepts online gambling advertisements, said Jodi Senese, a spokeswoman for Viacom Outdoor. She declined to give a reason for the decision or say precisely when the company's policy had changed.
 Other media companies have also turned their backs on Internet gambling advertisements. The Travel Channel stopped running them this fall on the World Poker Tour, one of the channel's most popular programs. David Leavy, spokesman for the Discovery Networks, which operates the Travel, Discovery and other channels, said the policy against running ads for Internet gambling covers all its cable channels. 
 ''Given the investigation,'' Mr. Leavy said, ''we are taking a cautious approach to online gaming advertisements.'' 
 Similarly, Clear Channel, which operates 1,200 radio stations and 40 television stations, stopped running advertisements last fall after receiving a letter from prosecutors. 
 Some companies, however, have not changed their policies. Yahoo and Google continue to accept paid advertisements from online gambling operations.
 Yahoo, in a statement responding to questions about its Internet gambling advertisements, said it was committed to a ''high-quality and comprehensive online experience,'' adding that ''we regularly evaluate our policies as part of our ongoing efforts to provide the best experience for consumers and advertisers.'' 
 A spokeswoman for Google said it continued to run such advertisements and to evaluate its policies.
 While it is illegal to run an Internet gambling operation in the United States, state laws vary as to whether the bettor is committing a crime. New York, for instance, prohibits operation or promotion of an unlicensed casino, but it does not make the act of placing a bet a crime, said Kenneth M. Dreifach, chief of the Internet bureau for the New York attorney general, Eliot Spitzer. 
 The campaign by the federal government dates at least to last June, when John G. Malcolm, deputy assistant attorney general for the criminal division of the Justice Department, sent a letter to trade groups representing publishers and broadcasters. The letter warned the trade groups that their members might be in violation of the law by aiding and abetting online casinos.
 While declining to comment further, Casey Stavropoulos, a department spokesman said, ''John Malcolm's letter speaks for itself.''
 By sending an official notice, the government was giving companies ''knowledge'' that Internet gamblers were committing a crime, legal experts said, one of two main elements to the crime of aiding and abetting.
 But aiding and abetting has a second element -- whether the broadcaster is furthering the commission of a crime, said Jennifer S. Granick, the executive director for the Center for Internet and Society at Stanford University Law School.
 Ms. Granick said case law suggested this might be hard for the government to prove; television and radio audiences are so broad that many, if not most, of the people watching or listening to an advertisement are not going to place a bet over the Internet. ''It's not at all clear that they're breaking the law,'' Ms. Granick said, noting that the broadcasters could be seen as merely disseminating information. ''There's strong reason to think the opposite because they are broadcasting to a general audience.''
 The investigation has recently spread beyond advertising. Mr. Sinclair, a research analyst for Christiansen Capital Advisors of New Gloucester, Maine, said the subpoena he received two weeks ago asked him to provide information not just about advertisers working with overseas Internet casinos, but also about public relations firms, consultants, banks, and software and telecommunications companies.
 In the earlier subpoenas to media companies, the government sought information dating to 1997 about each company's relationship with online casinos..
 Given the pressures on online casinos, Mr. Sinclair has recently downgraded his expectations for the growth of the industry, which derives about half its revenue from Americans. In 2002, he projected $8.3 billion in sales for 2004; last fall, he dropped that projection to $7.4 billion.

HEADLINE: $3 MILLION GRANT FOR FILM FESTIVAL

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
The TriBeCa Film Festival has received a $3 million commitment from the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. The money is to be used for expanding the festival's free programs and increasing downtown economic activity, which suffered after the 2001 terrorist attacks. This year's festival, the third, is scheduled for May 1 through 9. The grant will help finance the festival's guide and events, including a drive-in, panels, workshops and a seven-block family festival. ''The TriBeCa Film Festival has been a wonderful cultural event and economic boost for the downtown area,'' Kevin M. Rampe, the president of the development corporation, said in a statement late last week. ''We are pleased to be a part of the festival's continued success.'' In addition, Gov. George E. Pataki announced a $200,000 Empire State Development grant to support the TriBeCa Film Institute Inc., which will subsidize the institute's year-round education and networking programs.

HEADLINE: Study Finds a Waning Appetite for News

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG

 BODY:
A research institute associated with the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism has surveyed the journalistic landscape and concluded, not unlike others who have traversed similar ground, that the immediate prospects for newspapers and broadcast television news are bleak.
 The report, which is being released today by the Project for Excellence in Journalism, holds out some hope for the future of journalism -- it documents, for example, a surge in the popularity of Spanish-language newspapers, alternative weeklies and news Web sites. 
 But it also questions whether the so-called new media can succeed on a scale large enough to plug the losses being incurred by the old. 
 ''Journalism is going through this great period of transition and dislocation,'' said Tom Rosenstiel, a former reporter at The Los Angeles Times and Newsweek and director of the project, based in Washington. 
 ''The potential opportunities actually look very promising,'' he added. ''The question is economic.''
 In seeking to create a portrait of journalism as it is practiced and consumed today, the authors of the report, ''The State of the News Media 2004,'' gathered an array of statistics, most previously reported. 
 The authors note, for example, that the circulation of English-language newspapers in the United States has declined by 11 percent since 1990. But over roughly the same period the circulation of the country's Spanish-language daily newspapers has more than tripled, to 1.7 million, according to the National Association of Hispanic Publishers. 
 And the study reports that the combined circulation of alternative weeklies like the Washington City Paper more than doubled, to 7.5 million in 2002, according to the Association of Alternative Newsweeklies. 
 The report was financed by the Pew Charitable Trusts, which has been setting up a Web site, www.stateofthemedia.org, to make it available online. It was not given to news organizations in advance of its release, but several media reporters who were provided embargoed copies relayed some conclusions to representatives of these organizations, and the response was often critical. 
 The report argues, for example, that the combined audience of the three major cable news channels -- the Fox News Channel, CNN and MSNBC -- has been flat since late 2001, and that whatever additional audience those networks gained during the early days of the war in Iraq has been lost.
 Researchers at Fox News, citing data from the same source, Nielsen Media Research, said that a more appropriate time frame for measuring viewership is seven years -- during which the total cable audience, driven mostly by a rise in Fox ratings, has grown. 
 The Fox researchers also disputed the notion that the cable networks had lost any gains made during the war, contending that on a 24-hour basis, the three channels' combined viewership in December 2003 was 17 percent higher than in January 2003, before the war started.
 ''What you've got in this report is free-floating anxiety supported by selective use of the data,'' said Nicholas Schiavone, a former head of research at NBC who is now a consultant to Fox News. 
 Peter Bhatia, the executive editor of The Oregonian in Portland and the president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, did not dispute his industry's circulation decline.
 But Mr. Bhatia, who has judged several major journalism contests this year, said that the reporting and writing of newspapers as a whole -- and the role they play in society -- was difficult to capture in a sheaf of statistics.
 ''What those numbers don't show that I think is important is a qualitative indicator,'' he said. ''There is some phenomenally good journalism being done in this country.''

HEADLINE: Now That Japan Is Cool, Its Fiction Seeks U.S. Fans

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
In his small office on Park Avenue South, Ioannis Mentzas is surrounded by more than 1,000 books, nearly all in Japanese. Most, he said, aren't worth translating for an American audience. It is his task -- his obligation, his burden -- to pick the few that are.
 Mr. Mentzas said that as editorial director of Vertical Inc., a tiny publishing house dedicated to translating contemporary Japanese fiction into English, he tried to find novels that ''should appeal to readers who are not necessarily interested in Japan.'' 
 It is not lost on him that Japan is increasingly viewed as a source of hip culture, fueled by the popularity of anime, Japanese fashion and even the independent film ''Lost in Translation,'' the story of two lost souls in neon-lighted Tokyo, which won its director and writer, Sofia Coppola, a screenwriting Oscar.
 ''Japan has become a brand in terms of good storytelling and cool stuff, and I think that can carry over into literature,'' Mr. Mentzas said recently, his smudged glasses and battered sneakers betraying his former incarnation as a doctoral candidate in English and comparative literature at Columbia University.
 Born and reared in Japan to a Greek father and Japanese mother, Mr. Mentzas still keeps student hours, rolling into the office at 2 p.m. and staying after midnight, reading new novels or editing translations. He even slept in his office once to ensure that he wouldn't miss an 11:30 a.m. interview the next day.
 The company, founded by Hiroki Sakai, a former book editor and business journalist in Japan, published its first 10 titles last year. They included two volumes of ''Buddha,'' a graphic novel by Osamu Tezuka, considered the godfather of the Japanese comic art form known as manga; Koji Suzuki's ''Ring,'' on which the Japanese horror film of that title and an American remake were based; and ''Twinkle Twinkle,'' a novel by Kaori Ekuni about a woman who marries an alcoholic gay man to assuage their parents.
 This year the company plans 16 more titles, including ''Sayonara, Gangsters'' by Genichiro Takahashi, a novel that Mr. Mentzas described as ''a postmodern masterpiece.''
 When Mr. Sakai used to visit the United States he was struck by how few Japanese novels he could find in American bookstores. In 1998 he moved to New York with the idea of selling modern Japanese writing to American publishers. He tried unsuccessfully to sell four or five children's books. When he recruited Mr. Mentzas in 2001, he decided to form his own publishing house.
 Mr. Sakai persuaded Itochu International, a Japanese trading and investment company, to invest $600,000. Nihon Keizai Shimbun Inc., or Nikkei, as it is commonly known in Japan, Mr. Sakai's former employer, kicked in $200,000.
 When Mr. Sakai and Mr. Mentzas were looking for a name for the new publisher, they didn't want something that was too obviously Japanese. ''So no Cherry Blossom Press for us,'' Mr. Mentzas said.
 Still, Vertical subtly refers to the fact that Japanese characters are written and read vertically rather than horizontally.
 So far Vertical's books have attracted a handful of reviews in publications like Time Out New York, The Guardian of London and Tricycle, a Buddhist magazine. Sales are quite modest. According to Nielsen BookScan, the first volume of ''Buddha'' has sold 1,400 copies. ''Ring'' has sold 7,900 copies and ''Twinkle Twinkle'' just 130.
 But those who are interested in translated literature are excited about Vertical. ''There is, I feel, far too little Japanese fiction translated into English,'' said Robert Weil, executive editor of W. W. Norton, which has brought some foreign titles, mostly European works, to the United States. 
 Few modern Japanese novelists have found American audiences. Haruki Murakami, author of critically acclaimed novels like ''The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle'' (Alfred A. Knopf, 1997) and ''A Wild Sheep Chase'' (Kodansha International, 1989), and Banana Yoshimoto, who wrote ''Kitchen'' (Grove Press, 1993), are among the handful who have a following in the United States.
 A few other publishers are trying to bring more Japanese books to English-speaking readers. The American arm of Kodansha International, a Japanese publisher, translates one or two Japanese novels a year. In January it published ''In the Miso Soup,'' a thriller set in underworld Tokyo by Ryu Murakami (no relation to Haruki). 
 Random House recently started a joint venture with Kodansha to publish books in Japan, and Kodansha hopes to translate some works into English. 
 Anyone trying to sell translations faces a difficult market. ''Opening the door in many cases to a very different culture makes that aspect of the business wonderfully exciting,'' said John Glusman, editor in chief of Farrar, Straus & Giroux, which got its start translating European literature in the 1940's. ''But at the same time it's very challenging, especially from an economic view.''
 Much of Vertical's success will depend on the books it selects from the hundreds published in Japan every year. So far Mr. Mentzas and Mr. Sakai have chosen novels whose plots can be easily described in a few sentences and, they hope, might readily translate to film.
 ''If there is a lot of good Japanese writing to be translated, then I would say great,'' said Marty Asher, editor in chief of Vintage Books and Anchor Books, units of Random House. ''But if they're just doing it because Japanese is this week's literary flavor of the month, then I would be more skeptical. I hope they find lots of treasures.'' (Next year Mr. Asher's Vintage, which publishes Haruki Murakami's work in paperback, will publish ''Out,'' a mystery novel by Natsuo Kirino that was first published by Kodansha in hardcover.)
 Paul Anderer, a professor of Japanese literature and film at Columbia whose former students include Mr. Mentzas and a number of Vertical translators, said that he supported Vertical's efforts but that he wondered whether some of the company's novels would attract strong reviews or readers. ''I'm not sure that all of the fictions, as fictions, are necessarily going to hold up, no matter how cleverly packaged or marketed,'' he said.
 Mr. Sakai admitted that his friends in Japan think he is crazy. But that hasn't stanched his ambition. His goal? ''One million copies of one title, within this year,'' he said. He paused. ''Within several years,'' he appended, smiling.

HEADLINE: Georgian Leader Barred From Province

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: POTI, Georgia, Monday, March 15 

 BODY:
Georgia's military was on alert on Monday after President Mikhail Saakashvili was blocked from entering its separatist Black Sea province of Adzhara.
 Mr. 
Saakashvili, an American-trained lawyer elected after leading street protests that toppled Eduard A. Shevardnadze, threatened an economic blockade on Sunday after twice being blocked from entering the province.
 The dispute deepened already awkward relations between Georgia and its neighbor Russia, a patron of Adzhara, which warned Mr. Saakashvili not to resort to force.
 Mr. Saakashvili warned the Adzharan leader, Aslan Abashidze, that Georgia would close the region's airspace, block the oil port of Batumi and freeze accounts of companies linked to Adzharan leaders.
 The port ships around 200,000 barrels per day of oil and refined products from Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan.
 Georgia raised its military readiness after soldiers loyal to Mr. Abashidze blocked Mr. Saakashvili's convoy. His attempts to cross into Adzhara were thwarted first by a warning shot and later by a chanting crowd. 
 Adzhara's conduct, he said, amounted to armed revolt.
 The crisis around Adzhara, which is about the size of Luxembourg, underscores the fragility of Georgia, which lost control over two other openly separatist regions around the end of the Soviet era.
 Mr. Abashidze spent the weekend on one of his frequent visits to Moscow. He returned late Sunday night. He urged Russia ''to stop the invasion forces, which will bring new bloodshed and refugees.''
 Russia, which still operates a Soviet-era military base in Batumi that Mr. Saakashvili wants closed and that rivals the United States for influence in Georgia, was quick to warn Mr. Saakashvili.
 ''If there is a crisis, all responsibility will lie with the Georgian leadership,'' a Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman, Aleksandr Yakovenko, told Ekho Moskvy radio.

Spanish Voters' Anger Spurs Opposition Victory
Spain's opposition Socialists swept to an upset victory in general elections, ousting the center-right party of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar in a groundswell of voter anger and grief over the handling of terrorist attacks in Madrid. Many voters suspected Al Qaeda plotted the attacks to punish Mr. Aznar for supporting the war in Iraq. A1

The opposition victory in Spain is the first electoral rebuke of one of President Bush's most steadfast allies in the war on Iraq. A1

At least one of the five suspects being held by the police in connection with the Madrid terror attacks had been linked more than two years ago to an important cell of Al Qaeda that operated in Spain, according to documents and government officials. The suspect, Jamal Zougan, is a Moroccan immigrant. A12

Many Europeans, after the attacks in Spain, are suddenly confronting the prospect that Islamic terrorism is no longer somebody else's problem, as they might have thought, but an immediate and mortal threat. A13

Putin Wins Election in Russia
President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia won a second term in an election that had never been in doubt and that consolidated his centralized control of power. With most ballots counted, he had won more than 70 percent of the vote, but many Russian stayed away either because of apathy or out of protest. A3

Iraqi Rebels Sharpen Skills
Insurgent bombmakers in Iraq, whose roadside explosives claimed the lives of six more American soldiers over the weekend, have adopted new and grimly devious tactics. Military officers described vast improvements in the lethality and effectiveness of those weapons over recent weeks. A1

In a surprising turnabout, several Iraqi leaders on the Governing Council are balking at allowing the United Nations to return to the country. They say they are reluctant to give the organization a big role either in helping to prepare the Iraqi government to stand on its own or in readying the country for nationwide elections. A10

Bombing in Israeli Port
Two Palestinian suicide bombers blew themselves up minutes apart at the industrial port of Ashdod in Israel, killing 10 others and prompting Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to cancel a first meeting with his Palestinian counterpart. A1

Constitutional Change in China
China's Parliament formally approved constitutional amendments that address private property and human rights. At the same time, the country's new prime minister, Wen Jiabao, promised to rein in the overheated economy. A6

NATIONAL A14-19

Government-Produced TV Is Under Federal Scrutiny
Federal investigators are scrutinizing television segments in which the Bush administration paid people to pose as journalists praising the benefits of the new Medicare law, which helps elderly Americans with the costs of their prescriptions. A1

Comments by Senator John Kerry diverted attention from his themes of creating jobs and providing health insurance. He is being asked: Which foreign leaders told you they support your campaign? A16

New Death Penalty Debate
The struggle over the death penalty is returning to Illinois. Legislators and prosecutors say the landmark reforms that state lawmakers have adopted mean it is time to begin executions again. Critics of capital punishment praise the reforms but say many more must be made. A14

A Legal Thriller in Mississippi
A federal indictment is pending against a sitting Mississippi Supreme Court justice, his former wife, two former judges and one of the state's most prominent lawyers. Mississippi justice, the indictment suggests, is built on cozy relationships and fueled by bribes. A14

Theory in Murder Investigation
A day after Marcus Wesson, 57, was booked on nine counts of murder, after the bodies of family members were discovered in his home, details are emerging about the crime. Police Chief Jerry Dyer of Fresno, Calif., said investigators had a theory of what happened. He said he would wait until the completion of autopsies before disclosing the causes of the deaths. A14

2 Firefighters Die in Pittsburgh
A fire destroyed a historic black church in Pittsburgh. Two firefighters were killed and 28 others injured when the steeple collapsed and the debris broke through the floor into the basement. A19

An Actuary Amid Controversy
Richard S. Foster, Medicare's chief actuary, has created a political controversy with charges that Bush administration officials threatened to fire him if he shared data with Congress on the higher costs of new Medicare legislation. A18

Is Good Cholesterol So Good?
New research has called into question whether high levels of the good cholesterol are always good and, when they are beneficial, how much. Doctors are calling researchers and asking what to do about patients with high H.D.L. levels, and patients are left with conflicting advice. A1

HEADLINE: Bashful vs. Brash in the New Field of Nanotech

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

DATELINE: PALO ALTO, Calif. 

 BODY:
When it came time to invite a representative company to attend President Bush's signing of a bill last December authorizing $3.7 billion in federal spending on nanotechnology over the next four years, a three-year-old Silicon Valley company named Nanosys got the call.
 It is easy to see why. Painstakingly assembled by experienced entrepreneurs, famous academic researchers and big-name venture capitalists who know how to dazzle Wall Street, Nanosys is the epitome of a start-up shooting for business glory. 
 It brandishes a portfolio of impressive patents, covering processes like ways to make wires one ten-thousandth the thickness of a human hair, and is pursuing research projects that could affect consumer electronics, energy and communications. 
 But for all its glamour and promise, Nanosys does not expect to sell products commercially until 2006. For actual sales and profits, one needs to look to a more prosaic company, Nanofilm, a developer of optical coatings that is based in an industrial park in Valley View, Ohio, outside of Cleveland. It has been profitable since 2001. 
 ''We're the quiet company,'' said Scott E. Rickert, a 51-year-old former chemistry professor at Case Western University who has been president of Nanofilm since he founded the company in 1983.
 While Nanosys represents the aspirations of many of the 400 to 500 nanotechnology ventures that analysts say have sprung up in recent years, Nanofilm's story may actually be more relevant to the start-ups in the field struggling to survive. Together, the two companies show the diversity of the nanotechnology business landscape and some of the uncertainties it holds for investors.
 Nanotechnology, a term based on the nanometer, which is one-billionth of a meter, has attracted investment not only from privately held start-ups, but also from giants like I.B.M., General Electric and DuPont, which are eager to exploit the potentially valuable properties of materials so small that their dimensions can be measured in molecules. The federal government estimates that nanotechnology, a catch-all label for products and processes that operate on the molecular scale, will have a $1 trillion economic impact by 2015. 
 It may take that long to sort out the business models best suited to thrive in the nascent field. 
 Nanosys, based in Palo Alto, Calif., offers a model that is particularly compelling to Wall Street. Its neighborhood is home to Hewlett-Packard, Stanford University and some of Silicon Valley's most prestigious law firms and venture capitalists -- the entrepreneur's equivalent of beachfront property. Its scientific advisory board includes luminaries like Dr. Charles M. Lieber of Harvard, a leader in research on how to build nanoscale wires, and Dr. A. Paul Alivisatos, a chemist at the University of California at Berkeley whose research helped found the Quantum Dot Corporation, a start-up company that makes crystalline nanoscale tags that are used in the study of cell behavior.
 Nanosys's chief architect and chairman, Larry Bock, 45, was already well known as a biotechnology entrepreneur and, by his description, was semiretired when he became interested in nanotechnology in 2000. ''I had done reasonably well in biotech,'' he said, summing up his track record involving 14 start-ups, with 12 of them going public or sold to other companies for a total of more than $1 billion.
 Dr. Rickert of Nanofilm, by contrast, had no business experience and, he soon discovered, no ability to attract investment from venture capitalists when he formed his company. Instead of having wide-ranging patents from leading university laboratories, he had only his own idea for a new, unusually rapid way to make ultrathin, superrepellent coatings for glass, plastic and metal surfaces.
 When he changed his company's name to Nanofilm from Flexicrystal in 1985, the ''nano'' prefix had none of the allure it had when Nanosys was started in 2001. Outside molecular research circles, the name conjured up little except ''nanu-nanu,'' the way Robin Williams's goofy alien on the television show ''Mork and Mindy'' said goodbye. 
 ''I got a lot of grief,'' Dr. Rickert said in an interview at the company's headquarters. 
 Mr. Bock's track record, the growing interest in nanotechnology in the late 1990's, and his strategic approach produced a much different reception for Nanosys. He tells visitors he spoke to 1,000 researchers over an 18-month period before he and his co-founders, Calvin Y.H. Chow and Steven Empedocles, settled on a name, business plan and financial structure for Nanosys. 
 Nanosys's initial goal is to use its expertise in nanoscale silicon structures and related inorganic materials to build sensors and other simple products that its business partners would manufacture. In time, it hopes those efforts can become the foundation for more complicated devices like silicon solar panels, powerful memory chips and thin films for flexible electronic displays. 
 In essence, the company is creating a miniportfolio of nanotechnology bets that will allow it to pick out the most promising areas as some fall by the wayside and others arise. Nanosys has raised $55 million from venture capitalists like Venrock Associates, the venture arm of the Rockefeller family, and smaller firms like Lux Capital and Harris & Harris that are specializing in nanotechnology and related areas. 
 Nanosys has also raised more than $15 million from government research grants and deals with business development partners like DuPont, Intel, Matsushita Electric Works and In-Q-Tel, the Central Intelligence Agency's investment arm. Strategic alliances with big businesses are fraught with dangers for small companies, but one thing Nanosys and Nanofilm have in common is the belief that they will need such relationships to turn the new technology into profits.
 With Nanosys's second round of financing, which brought in $15.5 million in 2002, it far surpassed the total invested in Nanofilm over its entire existence. Nanofilm started with capital gathered from a small group of individual investors led by Donald McClusky, who had recently retired as vice chairman of Goodyear when Dr. Rickert set out to commercialize his thin-film technology.
 Dr. Rickert and Mr. McClusky managed to raise $1 million from friends and family by 1988. That supported enough development work for Dr. Rickert to persuade LensCrafters in 1989 to pay Nanofilm to build two 1.5-ton robots to put its high-strength, protective nanocoating on premium eyeglasses. LensCrafters also agreed to pay a $4 royalty for every pair of glasses sold. Nanofilm became profitable the following year.
 But Dr. Rickert's reliance on his relationship with LensCrafters backfired in 1991 when the Persian Gulf war broke out, the economy slumped and LensCrafters decided to shut its manufacturing in favor of outsourcing its production. Nanofilm shrank from 17 employees to 5. Dr. Rickert eliminated his salary and the others were cut to 65 percent. 
 ''We nearly went bankrupt,'' Dr. Rickert said. The company survived only because a lens-cleaning solution it had developed turned out to be popular with opticians and grew into a profitable line of products under the Clarity brand name. 
 Today, Nanofilm's films use nanostructured properties to keep rain off binoculars, preserve the shine on expensive faucets and protect display screens on A.T.M.'s and laptop computers. Other films from the company resist fogging or are scratch resistant.
 ''The company we are most like is International Flavors and Fragrances,'' said Dr. Rickert, referring to the world's largest producer of food flavorings and scents for household products and cosmetics. ''We sell very small quantities of our materials at high prices. I can do it anywhere in the world with just a few people.'' In fact, Nanofilm has become a multinational with a small sales and distribution outpost in the Netherlands. 
 Later this year, Nanofilm will distribute its first consumer product for the auto market -- an antistreaking windshield coating that mimics the nanoscale structures on the surface of lotus leaves that repel dirt. A couple of drums of the material's active compound could be made in a month's time and would be enough to treat every windshield in the world, Dr. Rickert said.
 When a raindrop or a bug hits the coating, which is intended to be applied once a year, the pressure melts the surface molecules for an instant, causing anything on the surface to slip away, Dr. Rickert said. But ''it's not perfect,'' he said, noting that because of its electrical characteristics, the film attracts some dust. 
 Still, such innovations have kept Nanofilm growing and, since 2001, steadily profitable. Revenues topped $15 million last year, Dr. Rickert said. The company began paying dividends to its 40 investors in 2001 and now has 65 employees. 
 Nanofilm's ambitions, though modest compared with those of Nanosys, are expanding. Dr. Rickert said his goals included increasing revenues to $30 million to $50 million over the next five years.
 If Nanofilm hits an area of research that requires a huge, rapid investment with potentially high returns, the company might try to spin that project off into a company backed by venture capital, he said.
 Dr. Rickert, however, does not want to expose Nanofilm to venture capitalists and investment bankers who might be impatient for growth and might push to sell the company or take it public. Instead, he said, Nanofilm will borrow money when necessary and continue to pursue joint development agreements with major customers, like its four-year-old partnership with Carl Zeiss Inc., the American subsidiary of the German high-performance optics company.
 ''We're on an exponential growth curve,'' Dr. Rickert said. ''We feel like it's our decade but it's on our schedule.''
 Such caution and focus provide no guarantee against losses. But Nanofilm's approach does prove that profits can be made in nanotechnology. 
 If the field is to become an important economic engine, in all likelihood there will have to be hundreds of small companies like Nanofilm exploiting different niches. 
 Whether those smaller companies will be operating in the shadow of a successful giant called Nanosys -- or reminiscing about how sweeping ambitions could not save a well-financed, well-placed start-up -- is harder to predict.

HEADLINE: Kerry Setting Out to Make A Good Second Impression

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER

 BODY:
When President Bush went on television last week with advertisements attacking Senator John Kerry, Mr. Kerry's campaign took precisely 12 hours to fire back with an expensive multistate ad barrage that accused Mr. Bush of ''misleading America.''
 The speed and scope of the counterattack took the Bush team by surprise and enlivened Democrats hungry for a fight this year. And the quick-paced exchange offered a glimpse of the strategy that Mr. Kerry's aides have settled on to deal with what they describe as a daunting task: how to redefine a president about whom most voters have very strong opinions, in the face of Mr. Bush's huge financial advantage.
 Part of that, Kerry aides said, would be an attempt to portray the president as a stubborn, out-of-touch ideologue with a record of broken promises. But beyond that, Mr. Kerry's advisers said they would seek to move quickly to try to flesh out voter perceptions of their candidate before Mr. Bush has a chance to. 
 After a primary season in which many Democrats said Mr. Kerry had spent more time vowing to fight Mr. Bush than setting out a vision for what he would do should he win the White House, Mr. Kerry's advisers said he would begin a series of speeches and campaign appearances, including a ''jobs tour'' and a ''health care tour.'' The intent is to extend his appeal beyond the hard-line Democratic primary voters who responded fervently to his ''bring it on'' attacks on Mr. Bush.
 Mr. Kerry's aides these days seem more confident than cocky, particularly after two weeks in which, they argued, Mr. Bush made a series of mistakes. They conceded that they had little hope of matching Mr. Bush in fund-raising and acknowledged his strong base of support, forged over three years in which he has led the country through difficult times. And they were thus aiming to compensate as much as possible by relying on coverage in the news media.
 But they take solace from recent public opinion surveys indicating that a slim majority of Americans want to see a change of direction in the White House.
 ''Once people form a negative impression of you, especially over multiple years, it's a lot harder to turn that into a positive impression,'' said one consultant to the campaign, who like several other advisers insisted that he not be named. ''And it's especially hard if you're throwing dirt.''
 They also insist that domestic problems like economic dislocation, skyrocketing health care costs and school-financing shortfalls will overwhelm the residual good will toward Mr. Bush from his handling of the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks.
 ''What's most important is what's freshest in voters' minds,'' said Stephanie Cutter, Mr. Kerry's communications director. ''The president can't come out now and say, 'O.K., I finally have a plan to fix the economy,' '' Ms. Cutter said. ''Where have you been for the past three years? John Kerry can.''
 How Mr. Kerry is seeking to define the president evolved out of weeks of attacks by Mr. Bush and equally vituperative responses by Mr. Kerry, some of which have worked while others have been discarded.
 When the Bush campaign lampooned Mr. Kerry as a ''flip-flopper'' on an array of issues, for instance, Mr. Kerry's aides retorted that Mr. Bush had broken promises to create millions of jobs, cut the deficit and make health care more accessible.
 But when Mr. Bush began promoting his ''steady leadership in a time of change,'' Mr. Kerry's campaign at first merely sniped that the only thing steady about it was that it was headed in the wrong direction.
 Only after Vice President Dick Cheney went on the offensive, suggesting that Mr. Kerry's ''indecision kills,'' did Mr. Kerry hit upon the notion that Mr. Bush was really providing ''stubborn leadership,'' which campaign advisers said worked on several levels -- not least because it evokes immaturity -- and would become a familiar refrain, along with ''broken promises.''
 ''It's a basic truth about his approach to the presidency, and it's a basic truth about how his policies are affecting the country,'' one senior Kerry adviser said. ''It'll be a case that'll be made throughout the entire campaign, from candidate to surrogates, to potentially advertising, to every other facet of the campaign.''
 The Kerry campaign is undeniably apprehensive about Mr. Bush's advertising blitz, but officials said there were several consolations. The placement of ads on ESPN and the Golf Channel, popular among affluent white men, suggests that ''they're going to have to use a lot of this money to just nail down what should have been theirs in the first place,'' a Kerry official said.
 Better still, they said, Mr. Bush's attack ads allowed Mr. Kerry to strike directly at the president, while appearing to be merely standing up for himself. Mr. Kerry's ads, which rebut the suggestion that he would raise taxes by $900 billion, accuse Mr. Bush of ''misleading America'' and put Mr. Kerry forward as offering ''a new direction for America.''
 ''That's a pretty neat trick for 30 seconds,'' said Geoffrey Garin, a pollster for Gen. Wesley K. Clark's campaign. Mr. Garin and other Democratic strategists said that Mr. Kerry's fast, sharp counterpunches were in themselves refuting part of Mr. Bush's argument against him.
 ''Going back at him shows Kerry being tough,'' said Tony Coelho, who was Al Gore's campaign chairman in 2000. ''It doesn't show Kerry as this weak liberal flip-flopper. He's tough, he fights back, he stands up, he doesn't apologize. And they've got to be frustrated because they can't get to him, they can't get inside.''
 Indeed, Mr. Kerry has taken every opportunity to hit Mr. Bush in response to the news of the day, a tactic he has used so frequently and effectively that his aides have made it an essential part of their strategy. On Wednesday, Mr. Kerry even got ahead of the news, attacking before it was announced the president's choice for manufacturing czar of a business executive who had laid off workers and opened a factory in China; the next day the executive withdrew from consideration.
 Kerry advisers have not had to look hard for openings. Last week, they pointed to the Senate's rebuff to Mr. Bush in backing a new rule requiring 60 votes to make his tax cuts permanent.
 Mr. Coelho said the Kerry campaign was reinforcing Mr. Bush's credibility problems in the news media the same way Mr. Bush, four years ago, poked at Mr. Gore's image of not knowing who he was.
 ''It is smart, it is very effective, and you don't need a lot of money,'' Mr. Coelho said.
 Mr. Kerry's aides said they would also be relying on news coverage to help them reintroduce him to the broader American public between now and the convention. 
 A senior campaign official noted that a poll last week found that 62 percent of Americans were giving the election a lot of thought. ''That tells me that it matters what we do day to day,'' the official said. ''Certainly advertising is a very important tool to build up your positives and refute a negative. But what you do day to day really matters.''
 Thus, the plans for a jobs tour and similar policy-oriented events, like the forum on Sunday in Bethlehem, Pa., where Mr. Kerry emphasized health care.
 While Mr. Kerry's aides said the Bush campaign might be right in viewing this as a rare moment when many Americans are paying attention to the race, they said that as the national spotlight fades they expected Mr. Kerry's speeches and town-hall meetings to gain plenty of attention where he needs it most: in the local media of battleground states.
 ''That's something we really found out in Iowa,'' the official said. ''When we weren't in the national newspapers, and people didn't even put us in the head-to-head polls in the Democratic primary, the local newspapers were fabulous, and the headlines were fabulous, and it paid off.''

HEADLINE: As Expected, Putin Easily Wins a Second Term in Russia

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS

DATELINE: MOSCOW, March 14 

 BODY:
President Vladimir V. Putin cruised to a second term on Sunday in an election that had never been in doubt and that consolidated his centralized control of power in Russia.
 Mr. Putin, 51, had already taken command of Parliament in an election in December and marginalized his opponents by limiting press access and harassing their campaigns. Last week, he effectively began his second term by appointing a new cabinet. 
 With nearly 90 percent of the ballots counted, Mr. Putin had received more than 70 percent of the vote. A candidate representing the Communist Party, Nikolai M. Kharitonov, was projected to win about 15 percent, an unexpectedly high showing that indicated that the party retains some of its populist base.
 Four other challengers did not rise above single digits.
 ''I promise that the democratic accomplishments of our people will be unconditionally defended and guaranteed,'' Mr. Putin said. ''We shall strengthen the multiparty system. We shall strengthen civil society and do everything to uphold media freedom.''
 He pledged economic growth and social stability at home and flexibility abroad. ''We will not in any way resort to aggressive measures or enter into confrontations,'' he said.
 Rights groups and some political commentators said this election signaled the end of Russia's post-Soviet experiment with democracy. Political opposition has been effectively eliminated, and it is assumed that Mr. Putin will select his successor in 2008 when he reaches the mandatory two-term limit.
 The election amounts to ''the formalization of the post-Communist system,'' wrote Lilia Shevtsova, a senior associate of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, in a commentary in The Moscow Times. ''From now on, it will not be possible to alter the rules of the game, create a party bottom-up, win an election without approval from the authorities or force one's way to the top independently.''
 Rather than a genuinely competitive election, this was in effect a vote of confidence on Mr. Putin's rule. Those who backed him generally said they were voting for what they saw as the stability of a strong central government. 
 The years since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 have been political and economically chaotic for Russians. Many seemed to be hoping for breathing space. 
 Some people stayed away from the polls, however, either because of apathy or as a protest against what they said was overbearing government manipulation.
 In Washington, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell urged Mr. Putin to ''do a better job'' of making democracy work.
 ''Russians have to understand that to have full democracy of the kind that the international community will recognize, you've got to let candidates have all access to the media that the president has,'' Mr. Powell told ''Fox News Sunday.''
 On the ABC News program ''This Week'' he said, ''We are concerned about a level of authoritarianism creeping back in the society.''
 The national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, speaking on the NBC News program ''Meet the Press,'' also criticized limitations on opposition campaigning.
 Mr. Putin responded by saying that constructive criticism was welcome but that he believed that those remarks were ''dictated by the internal political situation'' in the United States.
 ''No one has a right to think that if they criticize others, they cannot be criticized themselves,'' he said, adding, ''Nearly four years ago we watched in bewilderment how the United States electoral system suffered glitches.''
 Aleksandr N. Yakovlev, who was considered the ''godfather of glasnost'' under the last Soviet president, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, called the election a meaningless formality. ''The population has been manipulated and they know it,'' he said in a telephone interview from the Czech Republic.
 Many of those who voted did not show much enthusiasm.
 ''I voted for Putin because I don't know any of the others,'' said Vasily Chernolutsky, 20, a student. ''The main thing is for things not to get worse. If they get better, that would be great.''
 Vyacheslav Sokolov, 63, a retired television cameraman, said: ''I voted for Putin for one simple reason: Give the guy a chance to do his work. Let's see what he can do. If we put in someone new, we'll have to start from the beginning all over again.''
 Those who said they were not voting generally expressed stronger feelings than those who were.
 ''What's the point?'' said Mikhail I. Krendeshev, 29, a manager in a private company. ''The system has deprived us of any choice. My refusal to vote is not even a protest. It's just deep disillusionment in the way our country is heading and disillusionment after the collapse of the democratic forces.''
 The only suspense on Election Day was over whether the turnout would reach the 50 percent needed for a valid vote. The government mounted an aggressive get-out-the-vote effort, and human rights groups and opposition politicians said the numbers were in some cases artificially inflated to reach that threshold.
 Four years ago, Mr. Putin won the presidency as the anointed successor of Boris N. Yeltsin at a time of disarray and a weakened Kremlin.
 Since then Mr. Putin has asserted his control by limiting press freedoms, neutralizing political opposition and demonstrating his readiness to exercise power by arresting the nation's richest man, the oil baron Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky.
 Mr. Putin has worked to put in place a structure known here as a ''power vertical,'' a top-down system that relies on the control of powerful ministers and a rigid bureaucracy. Critics warn that a lack of checks and balances could make this system inflexible and repressive.
 Irina M. Khakamada, one of Mr. Putin's five opponents and the only liberal candidate in the race, characterized Mr. Putin's government as ruling by fear, and an atmosphere of insecurity has begun to creep back into Russian life. Mr. Putin, who once headed the post-Communist successor to the K.G.B., has filled much of his government with former members of the security services.
 One 43-year-old marketing executive angrily said he would not vote, saying: ''I don't want to be part of this farce. For 70 years these people have been oppressed by the K.G.B. and they vote again for the K.G.B.''

HEADLINE: Survey Finds Post-9/11 Times Harder for City's Artists

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

 BODY:
They are, to a large extent, the same worries that have always been voiced by New York City artists: the rents are too high, the pay is too low, and if things don't get better soon, I'm going to have to go. 
 But according to a new survey released last week, those problems have only grown in the two and a half years since the 2001 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center.
 ''It's never been easy, but it's basically like a lot of possibilities have ended,'' said Michael Cook, 52, a painter and graphic artist, who had a spacious rent-stabilized apartment overlooking ground zero. After the attack, he was forced to move to a smaller apartment in central Queens as jobs dried up and clients seemed hesitant to venture downtown. ''I'm essentially unemployed, and my prospects are worse over here,'' Mr. Cook said in a telephone interview. ''I really don't know what comes next, but I hope things get better.'' 
 The report, conducted by the arts coalition DowntownNYC, was based on answers from 175 working artists about their current economic status. (Painters, actors and musicians were the three biggest groups.) Although its sample was not large enough to be authoritative, the survey results are sobering.
 Eight percent of the respondents wrote that they had left New York City since 9/11, while an additional 5 percent had moved from downtown, traditionally home to the some of the city's most vibrant artistic neighborhoods. Forty-two percent of the respondents said they had to keep day jobs to pay the rent, decreasing their artistic output, while 13 percent said they were considering abandoning the arts altogether. 
 The survey, which was conducted by e-mail in early February, gives a sense of some day-to-day pains and annoyances faced by artists in the city.
 Take Stanley Allan Sherman, a 50-something actor and theater-mask maker who lives on West 14th Street. Mr. Sherman, who appeared in the Off Broadway play ''Grandma Sylvia's Funeral'' and plays a regular character on Conan O'Brien's late-night show, said that despite that, he was several months late on rent -- ''If I win an Academy Award, I'm thanking my landlady'' -- and thousands of dollars in debt.
 ''On a scale between 1 to 10, with 10 being extremely serious economic straits, I'd say I'm at 13 or 14,'' Mr. Sherman said in a telephone interview. ''And I'm doing better than most. It's just white-knuckle times everywhere. I've talked to five artists in the last year that have lost their homes, and most of them were people who I perceived as doing well.''
 One of the artists who left the city is Nancy Friese, a painter whose studio was in the trade center. She retreated to Rhode Island after losing $60,000 worth of work in the collapse. She said she did not paint regularly for nearly two years after the attack. 
 ''Somehow having a studio in the towers when they fell had a greater impact than I had realized,'' Ms. Friese wrote in her survey response. ''I was grateful not to be there, but on the other hand it called into question my whole reason for art.''
 The report, a follow-up to a similar Internet survey conducted in August 2002, also illuminates some new and unexpected challenges facing artists, including everything from the city's smoking ban, which some musicians say has cut attendance at rock concerts, to the increasing use of nonunion theater tours, which Equity actors say have reduced valuable work opportunities outside the city. Several survey respondents also complained about the loss of ancillary work like temp jobs and corporate events that had helped to pay the rent.
 Jonathan Slaff, who wrote the report with Delphine Veaudor, said a major concern was that more artists would leave the city or the arts altogether, a change that he said could hurt the local economy. 
 As an example, Mr. Slaff cited Jonathan Larson, who was an unknown composer working in the East Village when he wrote the musical ''Rent,'' which subsequently moved to Broadway, attracting tourists and creating jobs.
 ''Such arts workers are important intellectual capital to the city, but they are rarely acknowledged that way,'' Mr. Slaff said. 
 Some arts officials said that although the findings in the survey were not surprising, they were still a source of concern.
 ''It confirms all the anecdotal stuff I'm hearing,'' said the executive director of the New York Foundation for the Arts, Ted Berger. ''What I find sobering is that people are losing hope. There's nothing new that we don't know, but the idea that there's this very quiet brain drain going on is upsetting.''
 Among the respondents citing the uncertain economy and the shrinking pool of survival jobs was Corinne Edgerly, an actress living in Washington Heights. She said that even though she baby-sits and does home repair work to make money, those jobs can dry up for months at a time. ''I have difficulty finding even nonacting work at this point,'' Ms. Edgerly wrote. ''It isn't how I expect to continue in my artistic career at this point that is the major question. It's how I'm going to continue to survive financially.''
 Still, despite all the troubles, many respondents said that like generations of New York artists before them, they would persist.
 ''I write because I am a writer,'' wrote Valerie Cihylik, an actress and writer who is part of a small theater troupe. ''My theater company has produced plays with almost no money at all. It is inconceivable that I or my fellow artists would stop because of money. There has never been any money in theater or writing for anyone but the big names. In difficult times, and in good times, we are who we are.''

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New Jersey: Trenton: Lawmakers To Vote On Malpractice Bill

BYLINE: AP; Compiled by Vicki Vila

 BODY:
Legislators in the General Assembly are set to vote today on a legislative remedy to hold down escalating medical malpractice insurance costs that have prompted some doctors to threaten to leave New Jersey. The bill has stalled in the Assembly for a year, but lawmakers have tweaked it and say it will now provide financial help to doctors while maintaining the legal rights of malpractice victims. ''The bottom line is, doctors will get the relief they deserve and patients will get the care they need,'' said Assemblyman Joseph Roberts, the Democratic majority leader and a sponsor of the bill. The bill sets up a $90 million fund that would help doctors and hospitals pay insurance premiums for the next three years. The fund would be paid for by a $50-a-year license fee for doctors, lawyers, chiropractors and dentists and a new employers' tax of $3 for each worker for unemployment insurance. The bill tightens rules on filing lawsuits, though it does not put limits on awards, and gives state regulators the ability to scale back insurance rates that climb too quickly. The measure also sets stricter guidelines for filing malpractice lawsuits and gives judges more leeway to control verdicts.

HEADLINE: Industrial Production Rises 0.7%, More Than Expectations

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Industrial production rose a larger-than-forecast 0.7 percent in February as companies made more cars, electronics and business equipment, the Federal Reserve reported yesterday. 
 Economists had expected a 0.4 percent increase in industrial production. 
 The increase in production at factories, mines and utilities last month came after a 0.8 percent increase in January, the largest two-month gain since October and November 1999. 
 Increased consumer spending has kept inventories lean and is prompting factories to increase production to restock their shelves and warehouses. 
 ''Strong growth, a lower dollar and the need to increase inventories all suggest a need to increase production,'' said Cary Leahey, a senior economist at Deutsche Bank Securities in New York. 
 The economy grew at an average 6.1 percent annual rate in the second half of 2003, the largest growth since 1984. That growth has not produced jobs, as the fastest increase in productivity since recordkeeping began in 1947 has kept companies from hiring. Manufacturers have cut jobs for 43 months. 
 Federal Reserve policy makers, when they meet today, are expected to keep interest rates at an almost 46-year low because the expanding economy is creating too few jobs. 
 Last month, one manufacturing gauge held close to a two-decade high and more factories reported that they were hiring to meet demand, a report from the Institute for Supply Management this month showed. The group's production index showed output expanded for a 10th month in February. Seventeen of 20 industries surveyed increased production, paced by gains in chemicals, industrial equipment and electronic components.
 Even with the increases in production, the institute's index of order backlogs rose, suggesting that factories were not keeping pace with demand. Businesses so far have not been able to restock warehouses fast enough to meet demand. Inventories rose 0.1 percent in January, a fifth consecutive gain, while sales rose 0.4 percent, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. The ratio of inventories to sales held at 1.33 months' supply, a record low.
 ''Restoring inventory-to-sales ratios to moderately higher levels will require substantial inventory investment,'' said Steven Wood, president of Insight Economics in Danville, Calif.
 ''This would add significantly to economic growth.''

HEADLINE: Fannie Mae Cites Strength Of Its Stockholder Equity

BYLINE: By ALEX BERENSON

 BODY:
Fannie Mae, the second-largest financial institution in the United States, said yesterday that an important measure of its performance had been strong in 2003 after three relatively weak years.
 Fannie Mae said its stockholder equity had risen about $8 billion in 2003, after factoring out dividend payments and stock repurchases. That gain was almost equivalent to Fannie Mae's reported earnings of $7.9 billion for 2003. The disclosure was contained in Fannie Mae's annual financial report to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which the company filed yesterday. 
 The gains will not put to rest criticism that Fannie Mae, which owns or insures more than 25 percent of all American home mortgages, is too large and too risky. But Fannie Mae has withstood those complaints for years, and critics hoping for new ammunition in yesterday's report came away largely disappointed.
 From 2000 to 2002, Fannie Mae's shareholder equity and the fair value of its assets -- another important measure of its performance -- lagged far behind its reported earnings. The divergence led critics of the company to contend that Fannie Mae had suffered billions of dollars of losses that were obscured by the complexity of its accounting.
 In 2003, that gap closed, according to yesterday's report.
 Fannie Mae has discouraged investors from judging its results by the change in its shareholders' equity or its fair value. Those measures are very volatile and do not fully capture the value of Fannie Mae's business, said Jayne Shontell, senior vice president for investor relations.
 Changes in fair value and shareholders' equity are ''not something we really run the business by,'' Ms. Shontell said yesterday. The company hopes that yesterday's report, along with other information it has released about its portfolio of bonds, will quiet complaints, she said.
 ''We can't think of anything else to disclose,'' she said.
 But critics of the company, including former employees and some experts on interest rates, say that Fannie Mae has taken on too much risk in an effort to produce steady and strong profit growth. Many investors do not understand the risks Fannie Mae is running, and because the company's bonds are implicitly backed by the federal government, taxpayers could eventually wind up bailing the company out, critics say.
 The government created Fannie Mae in 1938, in the wake of the credit squeeze that worsened the Depression, to help make home mortgages more available. A decade ago, the company mainly insured mortgages held by other investors against default, an unglamorous but steadily profitable business.
 Today, Fannie Mae makes most of its money holding mortgages for itself and issuing its own debt to investors. That business is much riskier because mortgages can be prepaid if interest rates fall, making Fannie Mae subject to very complex risks related to changes in interest rates. Hoping to make bigger profits, the company has chosen not to hedge all of those risks, raising the possibility that a sharp move in interest rates could produce unexpected losses to taxpayers.
 Fannie Mae now owns about $880 billion in mortgages and guarantees $1.3 trillion more held by other investors. Over all, the company had more than $1 trillion in assets at the end of 2003, making it the second-largest financial company in the United States, behind only Citigroup.
 But in 2002, Fannie Mae appeared to be taken by surprise when long-term interest rates plunged between May and September, then rose sharply in October. Although the company reported $6.4 billion in 2002 in ''core business earnings,'' its favored measure of profitability, its shareholders' equity actually declined by almost $2 billion that year.
 Even accounting for dividends and stock repurchases, the company's shareholder equity was basically flat for the year. The difference came from huge hidden losses in Fannie Mae's portfolio, losses that could be deferred but would hurt the company's earnings in the future, critics said. They pointed to another line in the company's financial statement, ''accumulated other comprehensive income,'' which showed losses of $8.7 billion in 2002.
 Fannie Mae disputed those accusations and said its balance sheet did not fully reflect its value as an operating company. But when long-term interest rates again moved unexpectedly fast last year, rising more than one percentage point from mid-June to late July, critics warned that the company might again be facing big losses.
 Fannie Mae's shares, which are among the most stable of any big company, fell almost 20 percent over the summer, from $75.37 on June 4 to $60.41 on Aug. 20.
 But yesterday's report appears to show that Fannie Mae weathered the interest rate swings in 2003 without much trouble. The company's shares have regained their losses, closing yesterday at $75.20, off 50 cents
 ''This company is not on the ropes by any means,'' said Bert Ely, president of Ely & Company and a frequent critic. Still, Mr. Ely said the company remained highly leveraged and vulnerable to sharp swings in interest rates.
 ''If there is a bad turn against them, next year, whenever, then that is going to show up,'' he said. ''It is a risky game, no question about it.''

Amtrak Responds To Terror Attacks
 Amtrak is responding to the terrorist attacks on trains in Madrid last week by stepping up police patrols and ''conducting random baggage screening'' at major stations, said Dan Stessel, a spokesman for the railroad. The attacks in Spain came as Amtrak is struggling with its budget to keep pace with a steady growth in demand in the United States, as indicated by a 2.7 percent increase in ridership to a record 24,028,119 passengers in fiscal 2003, which ended Sept. 30.
 The Pacific Surfliner trains on the coast of Southern California roughly between San Diego and Los Angeles had 26.3 percent more riders in fiscal 2003 than the year before. Ridership on Acela-Metroliner trains in the Northeast corridor dropped 8.6 percent for the year because of equipment problems that forced a cutback in frequency, Mr. Stessel said. Frequency on those routes is nearly back to normal, he added.
 In the first four months of the 2004 fiscal year, Amtrak ridership nationally was up 7.6 percent.

International Travel Picking Up Sharply
 In the latest sign that international business travel has picked up sharply, and that premium-class travel is increasing on long flights, Emirates said it would begin daily nonstop service between New York and Dubai on June 1. Emirates, based in Dubai, said the route would be flown with ultra-long-haul Airbus A340-500 jets configured with 12 seats in first class, 42 in business and 204 in economy. 
 The New York-Dubai flights will depart from Terminal 4, which opened in May 2001 at Kennedy International Airport. Emirates is building a 12,000-square-foot lounge for first- and business-class passengers at Terminal 4, where it also plans to begin service with superjumbo A380 aircraft in 2006, when Emirates expects to receive the first of the 45 double-deck A380's it has ordered from Airbus.
 The Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific Airways, meanwhile, plans to begin daily nonstop service from New York to Hong Kong on July 1, using A340-600 aircraft configured with 8 first-class seats, 60 business-class seats and 220 economy-class seats. The service will supplement Cathay's existing one-stop daily service from New York to Hong Kong through Vancouver, British Columbia. 

It's Time Again For Spring Break
 It's spring break time and business travelers often have problems finding hotel rooms in areas favored by students. According to Travelweb.com, the top 10 spring break destinations are: Miami Beach; Orlando, Fla.; Las Vegas; New York City; Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, Fla.; Cancun, Mexico; San Diego; Daytona Beach, Fla.; Honolulu; and Phoenix-Scottsdale, Ariz.

HEADLINE: China Aims to Cut Pollution From Scrap Metal Industry

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG, March 15 

 BODY:
Eager to become the world's workshop, but wary of becoming its trash bin along the way, China is laying plans for stricter regulation of the scrap industry.
 Under a regulation issued in mid-December, businesses shipping scrap to China will be required to register with Beijing by July 1 and get government approval. Chinese regulators have not yet said what standards they will set in deciding which companies may register.
 Chinese imports of steel scrap have nearly doubled in the last three years and are expected to double again in the next two years, as the steel industry has expanded even more rapidly than the rest of the fast-growing economy. 
 In addition to steel scrap, imports of copper and other scrap have also increased, since it is considerably cheaper to remelt existing metal than to process raw ore.
 Meng Jianbin, the director of international cooperation at the Metallurgical Council of China for the Promotion of International Trade, a Chinese trade group, said that the scrap industry posed a continuing environmental problem.
 ''The environment is better than before, but it still has not reached the best result,'' he said. ''The scrap processors are using very old ways to do the scrapping, which is very harmful to the environment.''
 Most of the processors are still small and medium-size companies with little money to invest in modern, less-polluting equipment, Mr. Meng said.
 ''The government has asked the scrap processors to report to the government about whether the methods they use are harmless or not, but usually the scrap processors don't bother,'' he said. ''In the past, the scrap industry has been a mess. The government is now making rules for them to follow.''
 Felipe Tan, who used to own a scrap auction yard in Guangdong Province in southern China and a factory that sliced open secondhand telephone cables to extract the copper, said that he left the business after being undercut by smaller companies with dubious business practices.
 ''We got competitors coming in who were burning cables, throwing fiber scraps into the river,'' Mr. Tan said.
 The Bureau of International Recycling, a Brussels-based trade association with 500 members, including many of the world's largest scrap and waste management companies, supports greater regulation in China, said Francis Veys, the group's director general.
 Tighter supervision should result in a cleaner environment in China, he said, by making it harder for less scrupulous companies to dump almost anything in containers and send it across the ocean. It will also force companies to do more work in places like the United States and Europe, separating trash from scrap before shipment, Mr. Veys added.
 ''We are very much in favor of controls,'' he said.
 The rules may prompt China to shift its imports to rely less on Europe, where regulators have been quick to work with other countries that want to restrict trash imports, Mr. Veys said. He predicted that China might wind up depending on the United States for a greater share of its imports as a result, although trans-Pacific scrap shipments are already causing problems for American smelters that have found it tough to find scrap for their own operations.
 An environmental crackdown now in China would not be the first in the region. The scrap industry in greater China was centered in southern Taiwan in the 1980's, but shifted to Guangdong Province, up the Pearl River from Hong Kong, as Taiwan tightened environmental standards through the late 1980's. Guangdong, in turn, imposed tighter rules in the mid-1990's and shut many of the smaller scrapyards.
 This prompted many scrap businesses, though not all, to move 800 miles north to Shanghai, Nanjing and cities along the lower Yangtze River, a region that is also a big center of steel production.
 Much of the scrap is mixed with pig iron, produced from iron ore, to make the higher grades of steel that China's increasingly advanced economy needs in large quantities, said David P. Garcia, the managing director of Asia Iron Ltd., an iron ore company that has its operations in Nanjing and Australia but is based in Hong Kong.
 Some in China's scrap industry are skeptical that new government rules will have much effect. David Lo, the owner of one of the largest scrap-processing centers for copper and other nonferrous metals in southern China, said that it would not make financial sense to modernize by installing machines instead of relying on hand labor.
 The industry provides many jobs, he noted, and is so important to China that he doubted the government would do anything to disrupt it. ''There is a lack of raw materials like copper,'' Mr. Lo said, ''so China needs scrap.''

HEADLINE: Aramcons Find Arabia Like Home, Sort Of

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia, March 10 

 BODY:
Try not to make too much of the women driving sport utility vehicles, the baseball diamonds, the thousands of Americans and Britons or the cul-de-sacs with names like Prairie View at the well-guarded headquarters of Saudi Aramco, the world's largest oil company. 
 ''We are not a state within a state,'' Abdallah S. Jumah, Aramco's chief executive, said in an interview as he discussed the company's influence through its control of more than 10 percent of the world's oil production. 
 While Aramco's importance to the Saudi economy and the global energy industry is hard to underestimate, the company, like other Western-influenced areas of society, has been caught in the cross hairs of Islamic conservative objections to its American-style management approach. 
 For instance, while women nearly everywhere in Saudi Arabia are required by religious law to dress conservatively in black shawls and prohibited from driving, Aramco's female employees are allowed to wear Western clothing and drive on company property. Old-fashioned American business practices also persist at Aramco, down to the gold watch after 30 years of service. 
 And in a striking difference from many oil companies that were seized by governments in the developing world in the last century, Aramco never required its American employees to leave. Though its top executives are now Saudis, the official language remains English, making it easier for the 2,000 Americans who work for the company in Saudi Arabia, most of them living in this dusty city across the border from Bahrain. 
 ''We've had a fortunate lifestyle here,'' said Thomas Owen, 51, an American who was born in Dhahran while his father worked for the company and returned to Saudi Arabia after attending college in the United States to work in the purchasing department. ''There's been little incentive to leave.''
 The company still provides plentiful perks to attract American employees, who call themselves Aramcons. The benefits for Americans and other expatriates from rich countries include subsidized ranch-style suburban houses at Aramco's compound here, free health and dental care at the company's own hospitals, nearly 40 vacation days a year and free private education for children until high school, when the company will pay 80 percent of boarding-school costs in the United States. 
 Still, the attacks last year on Western residential compounds in the capital, Riyadh, and heightened awareness of anti-American sentiment throughout Saudi Arabia have reminded Aramco's employees of their tenuous position in Saudi society. Dhahran was the site of a bombing in 1996 that killed 19 American servicemen were killed and injured 64. Reacting to criticism from the religious conservatives and to economic pressures in a nation with growing unemployment, senior executives are purusing efforts to make Aramco more of a Saudi company. 
 American and European employees, for instance, are no longer assured lifetime employment when they are hired, as Aramco seeks to fulfill obligations to ''Saudi-ize'' its work force of 54,000 by hiring and training more Saudis. Critical areas of Aramco's operations are already entirely run by Saudis, like the futuristic control room where technicians manage the nation's oil output. 
 The emphasis on employing more Saudis is a priority. Out of a total population of about 24 million, Saudi Arabia has roughly 6 million foreign workers, most from Pakistan, India and other parts of Asia, who perform service jobs. Among Saudi men, the unemployment rate is 10 percent, according to government statistics, but is probably as high as 13 percent, said Nahed Taher, chief economist at National Commercial Bank in Jeddah. (Women, who are prevented from working in most areas of the economy, are not counted in unemployment figures.)
 Aramco's field operations are another area where officials are seeking to hire more Saudis. At Shaybah, an isolated oil production site tucked between sand dunes in the windswept Empty Quarter, nearly all of the 300 Aramco staff employees are Saudis, and there is pressure from above to hire more Saudis for the 350 nonstaff contracted positions. 
 ''It's a little like the opposite of outsourcing in other countries where the idea is to have fewer jobs,'' said Mohammed Hatlani, operations manager at Shaybah, which produces 500,000 barrels of oil a day. ''Sometimes these things are beneficial to the kingdom.'' 
 A job at Aramco, to be sure, is a prize for many Saudis, too. Their benefits include relatively high salaries, no-interest home loans and, for some Saudi women, the opportunity to work in a Western-style environment. There is also no income tax in Saudi Arabia, making a stable job at Aramco, the nation's largest single employer, more lucrative. 
 About 85 percent of the work force is Saudi, up from less than 60 percent three decades ago, when Aramco was controlled by American oil concerns and called the Arabian American Oil Company. It was formed in the 1940's by oilmen from California and Texas.
 Saudi Arabia nationalized the company in 1976 but kept its American management largely intact until the mid-1980's, when Ali al-Naimi became the first Saudi chief executive. Mr. Naimi, who later rose to his current position as oil minister, still serves as chairman of Aramco's board, which includes three American directors. 
 Traditionally loath to allow public scrutiny of its operations, Aramco recently opened up a bit after questions were raised about its reserves and its ability to remain the world's leading oil producer. 
 Commenting on the company's aversion to debt and its ability to finance its own extensive exploration, Nansen Saleri, the manager of reservoir management, said Aramco operated much as it did when it was owned by four American oil companies. 
 ''We have not changed one iota in this regard,'' said Mr. Saleri, a Turkish-born American citizen based at Aramco's Dhahran headquarters.
 Aramco, which produces about eight million barrels a day, generated an estimated $85 billion in oil revenue last year after prices climbed to their highest level in two decades, according to Brad Bourland, chief economist at the Samba Financial Group in Riyadh. The company's financial clout extends to other areas, like its fleet of jet aircraft used to travel inside and outside Saudi Arabia. All its pilots are trained in the United States or Britain. 
 ''It feels almost normal here until you get outside the company and its compounds,'' said Richard Pattee, a native of Tacoma, Wash., who moved to Dhahran in October to pilot the company's new Boeing 737. 
 Few Aramcons speak fluent Arabic, even among second- or third-generation Americans who grew up in Aramco communities. Still, their privileged and relatively isolated life has at times been punctured by the fear of terrorist attacks when they venture outside the Aramco cocoon.
 ''I still think we have a safer life than people back in the States, but I'm a lot more aware now than I was before,'' said Cathy Rylands, who was born in Ras Tanura, another Aramco location, and returned to Saudi Arabia after marrying an Aramco employee.

HEADLINE: Shares Hit New Lows for Year on Reports From Spain

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Stocks fell to new lows for the year yesterday in the wake of reports of evidence that Muslim fundamentalists with a connection to Al Qaeda were involved in the terrorist bombings in Madrid last week.
 In Europe, market indexes, except for Spain's, were down 1.2 percent to 2.7 percent, with the market in Germany hitting a new low for the year. In Spain, the main market index plunged 4.2 percent, to its lowest close of the year. 
 In the United States, where the three main market gauges fell more than 1 percent, airline, hotel and travel stocks were hit hard as investors worried that the threat of additional terrorist attacks would curb tourism this summer. Delta Air Lines plunged 12.2 percent. Walt Disney, which derives a significant share of its revenue from the tourists who travel to its theme parks, was off 3 percent. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 137.19 points, or 1.3 percent, to 10,102.89 and is down 3.4 percent for the year. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 16.08 points, or 1.4 percent, to 1,104.49 and is down 0.7 percent for the year. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 45.53 points, or 2.3 percent, to 1,939.20. It is off 3.2 percent for the year and 10 percent from its recent high of 2,153.83 on Jan. 26.
 The market's decline also reflected concern about the economy as investors sold stocks like Time Warner, off 3.7 percent, and Tupperware, down 4.9 percent, whose fortunes often turn down if the economy is slowing. The plunge in technology stocks also reflected worries about economic growth.
 The drop in airline stocks is also a reaction to a jump in the price of oil. Delta reported yesterday that it expected a $400 million loss this quarter because of the rise in jet fuel prices.
 ''It is very clear that investors not only are worried about the economy but also are worried about further acts of terrorism and their impact on the economy,'' said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer of the First Albany Corporation.
 Some economists argue that the economy's strong growth in the last six months could be undermined if job creation, which has been unusually slow, does not pick up its pace soon.
 The rising price of crude oil is also a threat because it has pushed gasoline prices to near record levels and is acting like a tax on consumers. The April contract for crude oil rose $1.25, or 3.5 percent, to $37.44.
 Henry Herrmann, chief investment officer at Waddell & Reed, attributed the market's softness, which he contended began in the first or second week of December, more to economic concerns than to terrorism.
 ''The correction got legs with the February employment report, which cast aspersions on the sustainability of the economy,'' he said. ''I don't think terrorism is the fundamental problem of the tape. I think the fundamental problem is jobs.''
 Another factor in the selling may be that many investors are expecting a significant market correction. Until last week, neither the Dow nor the S.&P. 500 had declined 5 percent since the stock market rally began last spring.
 At the close of trading last Thursday, the Dow was down 5.7 percent from its recent high of 10,737.70 on Feb. 11. And the S.&P. 500 is now less than 5 points from reaching its own 5 percent fall from its recent high of 1,157.76 on Feb. 11. 
 ''No one should be surprised that this is occurring,'' Mr. Johnson said, given that the stock market's run since last March is one of the longest without a 5 percent correction.
 General Electric, which announced that it was buying InVision Technologies for $900 million, fell 30 cents, to $30.30. InVision surged 19.7 percent, or $8.13, to $49.35.
 In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury note gained 6/32, to 10130/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 3.76 percent from 3.78 percent on Friday.
 Here are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Japan Trips Mean World To Baseball

BYLINE: By Richard Sandomir

 BODY:
Opening the regular season in Japan is not an easy task for major league teams, with jet lag and the reality of resuming play in the United States three days later, as the Yankees and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays will discover this month.
 ''There was some concern about that,'' said Dave Howard, executive vice president of the Mets, who split the first two games of the 2000 season with the Chicago Cubs at the Tokyo Dome. ''But we won the National League pennant that year.''
 The long relationship between Major League Baseball and Japan has grown more intimate in recent years as some of Japan's best players -- Hideo Nomo and Ichiro Suzuki, and Hideki and Kazuo Matsui -- have signed with major league teams, spurring huge interest abroad. 
 In 2000, Yomiuri Shimbum Holdings, which owns the Yomiuri Giants, promoted the Cubs-Mets series in Tokyo; last year, Yomiuri's hope of attracting Seattle, a huge draw because of Suzuki, to play Oakland was derailed by terrorism fears once the Iraq war began. Yomiuri is once again promoting the Yankees-Devil Rays series, which will be preceded by exhibition games against the Giants and the Hanshin Tigers.
 ''It'll be interesting to see what rates higher, the Yankees-Yomiuri Giants game, with these two storied franchises and Hideki Matsui's return, or the two regular-season games,'' said Paul Archey, the senior vice president of Major League Baseball International. Matsui, the Yankees' left fielder, is a former Yomiuri megastar; the Mets' Kazuo Matsui spurned an offer from the Giants and left Japan for Flushing.
 To get the series, Yomiuri pays M.L.B. International a fee. Between the fee and other marketing revenues in Japan, baseball compensates the teams for all the gate and concessions receipts they lose by ceding spring training and home dates. 
 ''The operating principle is to put the club in the same position financially as if they hadn't gone at all,'' said Tim Brosnan, M.L.B.'s executive vice president for business.
 Brosnan would not say what Yomiuri is paying, but he indicated that it had grown, though not at the same rate that Dentsu, the advertising giant, agreed to pay last year for the Japanese rights to M.L.B. games. At an estimated $275 million over six years, Dentsu more than tripled its previous annual payments. Dentsu sublicenses the rights to various broadcast and satellite outlets.
 The Yankees are highly desirable to the Japanese market; Matsui is a huge factor, and the working agreement between the team and the Yomiuri Giants are reasons enough for the Yankees to want to go to Japan.
 ''If they didn't have Matsui, the Yankees wouldn't be playing in Tokyo,'' said Robert Whiting, the author of ''The Meaning of Ichiro.'' Matsui has made a large enough impact on New York's economy to be hired to promote it by the city's convention and visitors bureau. Whiting added, ''Japanese fly in on package tours from Japan to watch a three-game series in New York, buy Yankees jerseys and Matsui bobblehead dolls, then fly back.''
 Baseball first sent two teams abroad to open the season in 1991, but Japan has not been the only destination. That first year, the site was Monterrey, Mexico, and in 2001, it was Puerto Rico. But Japan accounts for about 40 percent of M.L.B. International's revenues. 
 And Tokyo is popular to sports other than baseball. The National Football League has staged 12 exhibition games there, including Tampa Bay's 30-14 victory over the Jets last August. The National Basketball Association sent the Los Angeles Clippers and the Seattle SuperSonics there to open this season.
 Last year, Japanese viewership of major league games averaged 1.5 million viewers in Japan, up from 983,000 in 2002. Total viewership of the World Series on broadcast and satellite outlets soared to 75 million last year from 10.2 million in 2002, a figure reduced by the games being carried almost entirely by satellite.
 Japan is the easiest but not the sole object of baseball's desire. Back in 1993, two Class AA teams played a springtime exhibition game on a cricket grounds in London. Baseball is willing to retrofit rugby and soccer stadiums to get a foothold in Europe; two countries, Italy and the Netherlands, have ballparks and a growing affinity for baseball. Interest has also been received from Korea.
 But Japan is still the most crucial market and could be where George Steinbrenner and his Yomiuri counterpart, Tsuneo Watanabe, hold a mogul summit. Steinbrenner calls Watanabe a ''dear friend.''
 ''George has never met or spoken to him,'' said Howard Rubenstein, a spokesman for Steinbrenner. ''But they've exchanged letters and have extended their mutual respect.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Takes Steps to Tighten Mexican Border

BYLINE: By ERIC LICHTBLAU

DATELINE: PHOENIX, March 15 

 BODY:
Federal officials have become increasingly worried about a surge in violence and instability along the Arizona-Mexico border and will begin what they describe as a major air and ground initiative to help keep out illegal immigrants, drug smugglers and possibly terrorists, officials said on Monday.
 The $10 million plan, to be announced on Tuesday by the Department of Homeland Security, will include the first use of unmanned aircraft for border patrol, the addition of several hundred agents and the creation of seven tent complexes to detain illegal border crossers.
 Asa Hutchinson, an under secretary for domestic security, said in an interview that a tightening of security in border areas in California, Texas and elsewhere had led smugglers to turn in increasing numbers to Arizona -- often with violent results. 
 ''This is not a secure border,'' Mr. Hutchinson said. ''Arizona has become the chokepoint. This is our current battleground.'' 
 But some human rights and immigrants' advocates believe that broader economic and political changes -- rather than a law enforcement crackdown -- are the answer.
 ''Our border is in utter chaos here in Arizona,'' said the Rev. Robin Hoover, head of a Tucson group called Humane Borders that provides relief for migrants, ''but a Berlin Wall is not the way to solve the problem.'' 
 Moreover, the unmanned aircraft face technical and safety hurdles. A report in January by the Congressional Research Service said that drones, as the aircraft are commonly known, offer several attractive features for border patrol work and can identify ''a potentially hostile target the size of a milk carton at an altitude of 60,000 feet.'' But their use is also hindered by accident rates more than 100 times that of manned aircraft, according to the report. 
 ''I think the jury is still out'' on unmanned aircraft, Mr. Hutchinson acknowledged, but he added that ''we're looking for new tools.''
 Homeland security officials expect to begin using the remote-controlled aircraft in June to supplement manned air and ground patrols. It will be the first time the drones will be used for border patrol in the United States, other than on a trial basis, officials said.
 The officials would not give details about the drones, including their numbers or how frequently they would patrol.
 The unmanned aircraft will allow federal officials to spot crossers along parts of the more than 300 miles of the often-desolate border in Arizona that are not regularly patrolled, said David Aguilar, who is chief border patrol agent in Tucson.
 Federal officials also plan to expand their patrols with helicopters and manned airplanes, create a new interagency network to coordinate the initiative, and add 200 permanent border patrol agents and 60 temporary agents trained in search and rescue operations. The increase will bring the number of border agents in Tucson to more than 1,900.
 Officials will also create seven air-conditioned tent complexes to house and detain some immigrants until they can be sent home, rather than freeing them before court appearances and risking having them flee, Mr. Hutchinson said.
 Homeland Security officials said they expected to spend $10 million in the next six months on the additional personnel and technology.
 ''This is going to make a tremendous difference,'' said Mr. Aguilar, who will run the interagency effort. ''It will be a very different focus.''
 The past few months have seen a spasm of violence and apprehensions along the Arizona border, even as illegal border crossings in other parts of the country have dropped.
 Border Patrol agents in Arizona apprehended nearly 200,000 people from last October to early March, a rise of 34 percent over the same period a year earlier. And seizures of marijuana at the border were up 17 percent, Mr. Aguilar said.
 With the influx have come more immigrant deaths in the desert -- more than 200 last year by Mr. Hoover's count, many because of the heat. There have also been execution-style shootings, tortures and kidnappings that law enforcement officials blame on human smuggling rings. Four people died in a shootout between immigrant smugglers on an Arizona interstate last November.
 Mr. Hutchinson described the smugglers and other traffickers in immigrants and drugs across the Arizona border as ''greedier, more ruthless and more violent'' than before. ''These are people who have no regard for anyone's safety,'' he said.
 He added that the potential problems went beyond drugs and illegal immigrants. ''Any time you have vulnerabilities at the border, you have to worry about terrorists taking advantage of that too,'' he said.
 But Mr. Hoover, whose group provides water stations in the Arizona desert for immigrants, said resourceful traffickers would always find a way to get across the border unless officials looked at the root causes of immigration problems.
 ''It's like putting rocks in a river -- the water just goes around it,'' he said. ''You can show off a lot of new technology and more men and women in uniform, but it's all just more of the same.''

Death Penalty Sought for Driver
 HOUSTON, March 15 (AP) -- Federal prosecutors said Monday they would seek the death penalty against the driver of a truck in which 19 illegal immigrants suffocated last year.
 Prosecutors say Tyrone Williams, 33, of Schenectady, N.Y., drove more than 70 illegal immigrants from Mexico, Central America and the Dominican Republic on May 13 from the Rio Grande Valley toward Houston. Prosecutors say that when the immigrants began succumbing to the heat in the trailer, Mr. Williams abandoned it 100 miles southwest of Houston. Seventeen immigrants were found dead inside the truck. Two others died later.

HEADLINE: Fresno Victims Were Shot, Police Report

BYLINE: By CAROLYN MARSHALL

DATELINE: FRESNO, Calif., March 15 

 BODY:
The nine victims in this city's worst mass murder all appear to have been shot to death, the police said on Monday.
 They said investigators were trying to determine whether the suspected killer, believed to be the father of all the victims, was helped by someone else. 
 The bodies were found on Friday when the police responded to a child-custody call at a house. After a standoff with the suspect, Marcus D. Wesson, 57, they took him into custody. Mr. Wesson's arraignment on nine counts of murder has been scheduled for Wednesday. 
 Three of the victims were 1 year old, and four others were younger than 9. The other two victims were a 17-year-old girl and a 24-year-old woman, the police said. Two of the toddlers may be the result of incestuous relations between Mr. Wesson and his older daughters, the authorities said.
 Autopsies on seven of the victims indicate that they suffered gunshot wounds, while injuries on the last two bodies still under examination exhibited injuries similar to gunshot wounds, the authorities said.
 The Fresno County coroner's office said one of the victims might have been somehow involved in the shootings. Chief Jerry Dyer of the Fresno Police Department declined to comment about a second killer but said it was ''something we are keeping an open mind to.''
 Chief Dyer said more search warrants had been issued for another Fresno address.
 Chief Dyer and officials at the Fresno County Department of Child and Family Services also said that the authorities never received complaints about the Wesson family that would have raised concern. ''I don't know that anything could have been done to prevent this,'' he said.
 The police investigation and interviews with residents provide a portrait of Mr. Wesson as an intelligent but extremely controlling and private unemployed man who may have been supported by the women who gave birth to his children.
 Serafino Wesson, 19, the youngest living son of Mr. Wesson, spoke lovingly of his father and the brothers and sisters he last saw alive on Friday morning, before he left the house for the day.
 The son, upset as he recovered personal items at the home on Saturday, described his father as a good parent who kept his family close and home-schooled his children because he distrusted the public education system. 
 ''It was a nice way to grow up,'' he said about having many siblings. ''And I can't name another 19-year-old who has no record and obeys his parents.''
 He confirmed earlier reports that he and his brothers attended martial arts classes. ''My father thought it would help us learn to defend ourselves and deal with people,'' he said.
 Neighbors described the father, a former Vietnam War medic, as withdrawn and private. Some members of the family were rarely seen outside during the day and seemed active only at night, typically after 10 p.m. Just how reclusive the family was could be seen in discussions with nearby residents.
 ''I never even knew there were kids living there,'' said one neighbor, Patrick Collazo, 44. ''I'd never seen them. That's why the murder of kids came as such a shock.''
 Several neighbors commented on ''strange odors'' that emanated from the backyard almost every night. The Wesson family seemed to have nightly barbecues.
 ''At least twice a week when they were barbecuing there would be an odor,'' said Barbara Alec, 61, who lives next door to the Wesson house. ''It would kill you to smell it. It would gag me. Whatever he was cooking, it was not food. If it was food, they must have used strange spices.''

HEADLINE: Pakistani's Nuclear Earnings: $100 Million

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and WILLIAM J. BROAD

DATELINE: OAK RIDGE, Tenn., March 15 

 BODY:
The Bush administration said Monday that the clandestine network created by Abdul Qadeer Khan, the Pakistani nuclear scientist, netted $100 million for the technology it sold to Libya alone, and for the first time officials displayed a carefully selected sample of the type of equipment that the network sold to arm Libya, Iran and North Korea.
 Under extraordinary security -- guards with automatic weapons stationed every few yards -- officials showed reporters the most basic of the high-speed centrifuges that Dr. Khan marketed to countries seeking to enrich uranium for bomb fuel. Many of the centrifuges, flown out of Libya and stored here at one of America's first nuclear weapons laboratories, were still in their original packing crates. 
 But the most critical components shipped out of Tripoli -- including 4,000 more advanced centrifuges and the drawings Dr. Khan sold showing how to turn the uranium into crude warheads -- were kept out of view. So were labels and other evidence that would link specific products to Pakistan, Germany, Malaysia and a dozen other countries where Dr. Khan's network of suppliers and manufacturers operated over the past decade.
 North Korea and Iran are believed to have purchased essentially the same package of technology that Libya obtained after negotiating with Dr. Khan in the mid-1990's.
 The event here on Monday was part of a weeklong effort by the administration to trumpet what it views as one of its biggest foreign-policy accomplishments growing out of the invasion of Iraq a year ago.
 ''We've had a huge success here,'' said Spencer Abraham, the secretary of energy, who is in charge of overseeing the American nuclear stockpile. Surrounded by the cache of nuclear equipment, Mr. Abraham argued that the decision announced in December by Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi to disarm completely and rapidly came because of ''the resolve that we and others conveyed in Iraq, which has forced countries to make a choice.''
 Mr. Abraham said that virtually all of the 55,000 pounds of nuclear gear already brought out of Libya, which appears headed to a lifting of most American economic sanctions next month, now rests here, behind barbed-wire fences in the hills of eastern Tennessee.
 The equipment, he said, was ''the largest recovery, by weight, ever conducted under U.S nonproliferation efforts'' but was ''just the tip of the iceberg'' because a shipload of Libyan equipment is currently sailing to the United States.
 Such work, he said, ''spells out our commitment to winning the war against terrorism.''
 Libya never began to produce enriched uranium, though experts here said that if assembled, the equipment that the United States, the International Atomic Energy Agency and other nations have recovered could have produced enough fuel to make up to 10 nuclear weapons a year.
 Libya had obtained a bit less than half of the 10,000 centrifuges it hoped to operate, before determining that the program was not worth the diplomatic cost. ''The program was much more advanced than we assessed,'' Robert Joseph, who heads counterproliferation efforts in the National Security Council, said here. ''It was much larger than we assessed.''
 The $100 million estimate was nearly twice as high as the highest previous estimate of what Libya paid for its nuclear technology. That figure does not include what Iran and North Korea or other customers of the Khan network that the officials declined to identify Monday, citing continuing investigations, paid to the network of suppliers. 
 On Saturday, Iran announced a freeze on inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency to protest the terms of a resolution that chided the country for failing to cooperate fully with inspectors. On Monday, the head of the agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, said in Washington that Iran had changed its position and would allow the inspections to resume on March 27.
 The $100 million figure does, however, explain how a government scientist like Mr. Khan could afford a lavish lifestyle, in Pakistan, in homes around the world and at his hotel in Mali. One official noted that given the relatively small number of principal players in the Khan network -- maybe a dozen people in all -- it ''made it a very lucrative trade.''
 ''The network's financial dealings were deliberately complex and we do not yet have a complete picture,'' said Jim Wilkinson, a deputy national security adviser who made the trip here. ''The developing picture, however, indicates that the Khan network received at least $100 million for supplying technology, equipment and know-how'' to Libya, he said. ''It was truly one-stop shopping.''
 Under a tent in a parking lot of the heavily guarded complex here, officials set up a display of dozens of large wooden packing crates that contained Libya's disassembled nuclear program, as well as small number of items that they had declassified. Among them were four aluminum centrifuges, called P-1's, the nomenclature for the first generation of Pakistani centrifuges based on a design that Dr. Khan stole from Europe and used to make the uranium for the first Pakistani nuclear weapons. 
 Gleaming, the aluminum tubes stood more than six feet tall, with three pipes coming out the top of each. The centrifuges, basically hollow metal tubes, spin at the speed of sound to separate uranium 235 -- which is used as the main ingredient for bombs -- from unneeded uranium 238.
 In front of the display lay a six-foot-long piece of cascade piping -- the line that in an operating plant would tie the centrifuges together. A set of thousands of centrifuges, called a cascade, concentrates the rare U-235 isotope to make potent bomb fuel. Each centrifuge in a cascade makes the uranium a little more enriched in the U-235 isotope.

HEADLINE: GREENSPAN SHIFTS VIEW ON DEFICITS

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 15 

 BODY:
Consumer debt is hitting record levels. The federal budget deficit is yawning ever larger. The trade gap? Don't even ask. 
 Many mainstream economists are worried about these trends, but Alan Greenspan, arguably the most powerful and influential economist in the land, is not as concerned.
 In speeches and testimony, Mr. Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, is piecing together a theory about debt that departs from traditional views and even from fears he has himself expressed in the past. 
 In the 1990's, Mr. Greenspan implored President Bill Clinton to lower the budget deficit and tacitly condoned tax increases in doing so. Today, with the deficit heading toward a record of $500 billion, he warns more emphatically about the risks of raising taxes than about shortfalls over the next few years.
 On Monday, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office published new calculations showing that the budget deficit now stems almost entirely from tax cuts and spending increases rather than from lingering effects of the economic slowdown. [Page A18.]
 Mr. Greenspan's thesis, which is not accepted by all traditional economists, is that increases in personal wealth and the growing sophistication of financial markets have allowed Americans -- individually and as a nation -- to borrow much more today than might have seemed manageable 20 years ago. 
 This view is good news for President Bush's re-election prospects. It increases the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will keep short-term interest rates low. And it could defuse Democratic criticism that the White House has added greatly to the nation's record indebtedness.
 Adjusted for inflation, the average family's debt, including a mortgage, has climbed from $54,000 in 1990 to $79,000 last year. Mortgage foreclosures, credit card delinquencies and personal bankruptcies are all at near record levels. 
 Mr. Greenspan's view is that household balance sheets are ''in good shape,'' and perhaps stronger than ever, because the value of people's homes and stock portfolios have risen faster than their debts.
 The Fed chairman is equally sanguine about the nation's overall borrowing from foreigners, which has soared to more than $500 billion a year and has contributed to a sharp drop in the value of the dollar. And he has also made it clear he will not try to torpedo the president's tax-cutting agenda, which could add another $2 trillion to federal borrowing over the next decade.
 ''History suggests that the odds are favorable that current imbalances will be defused with little disruption,'' he declared in a speech two weeks ago. 
 But a growing number of experts are worried that Mr. Greenspan is too casual. Though most economists agree that American's indebtedness is not a problem at the moment, many worry that the country has become too dependent on extraordinarily low interest rates.
 ''The fear I have is that the world is leveraged on low-interest borrowing,'' said Allen Sinai, chief executive of Decision Economics, an economic forecasting firm. ''It's like a drug, and you get hooked on it.''
 According to the Federal Reserve's most recent data, household wealth bounced back after the economic slowdown and hit a record at the end of 2003.
 But the main reason for that new wealth has been rising prices for real estate and stock, and those prices have climbed in large measure because interest rates are at their lowest level in more than 40 years.
 If inflation rises and the Fed feels forced to raise rates, many economists worry that monthly debt burdens would rise at the very moment that housing prices start to decline. 
 ''The day of reckoning is not now, but maybe five years from now,'' said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. ''To go down Greenspan's route is like saying there is a free lunch. The fallacy is that net worth has gone up because debt went up. And that doesn't give me a good feeling.'' 
 Other analysts have begun to dispute Mr. Greenspan's benign view of rising household debt. Mark Zandi, economist at Economy.com, said many other indicators suggest that financial stress has risen significantly in the last two years.
 Mortgage foreclosure rates, personal bankruptcies and credit card delinquencies have been rising steadily and are at record levels. Most of that stress has taken place in lower-income families, which is why it has not made a big impact on aggregate data about national wealth.
 ''These people who have heavy debt don't have stable incomes,'' Mr. Zandi said. ''They're the ones who are getting pummeled by the loss of call-center jobs. These are the folks who rely on two incomes, the ones who don't have any assets.''
 Though Mr. Greenspan has not articulated a sweeping new view, his public comments on particular topics provide a mosaic of his thinking and suggest that he is groping toward his next big idea.
 Mr. Greenspan's last big idea came 10 years ago, when he correctly perceived that American productivity was growing much faster than official statistics suggested and that the country could grow much more rapidly without inflation than most experts believed at the time.
 But after having reduced the federal funds rate on overnight loans to just 1 percent, the lowest level in 46 years, Mr. Greenspan has presided over an explosion in home buying, mortgage refinancing and consumer spending fed by cheap money.
 Mortgage debt soared by more than one-third to $6.8 trillion in 2003 from $4.9 trillion in 2000. And though many people borrowed against their houses to pay down more expensive credit card debt, nonmortgage consumer credit climbed by $300 billion, or about 15 percent.
 In a Feb. 23 speech to the Credit Union National Association, Mr. Greenspan made it clear that such borrowing cannot keep that pace indefinitely. But he said the rise in debt had been matched by a rise in real estate values and stock portfolios.
 ''The surge in mortgage refinancings likely improved rather than worsened the financial condition of the average homeowner,'' he said. Though bankruptcy rates had climbed sharply, he continued, these were ''not a reliable measure'' of household financial health.
 Mr. Greenspan went on to note that household debt burdens had been rising for the last half-century as lenders extended credit to wider segments of the population.
 That leads to Mr. Greenspan's broader idea: that financial institutions have steadily expanded credit by developing complex new instruments like credit swaps to hedge their risks.
 Back in June 2001, the Fed chairman praised the use of new risk-scoring techniques to expand ''subprime'' lending to people with poor credit histories.
 ''Such lending is favorable both to borrowers and lenders,'' he said in a speech to bankers that year. People with poor credit gained access to loans that would otherwise be unavailable, he said, while lenders obtained ''the opportunity for higher returns.''
 In speeches, Mr. Greenspan has argued that advanced new hedging techniques helped financial institutions survive huge loan losses to telecommunications companies after the stock market bubble collapsed. 
 ''Unlike in previous periods of large financial distress, no major financial institution defaulted,'' Mr. Greenspan told a conference sponsored by the British Treasury in January. Novel tools for hedging risk, he concluded, had created a ''far more flexible, efficient, and hence resilient financial system than existed just a quarter-century ago.''
 Mr. Greenspan has voiced similar thoughts about the United States' huge current account deficit, which reached a record $541 billion in 2003.
 Like many economists, Mr. Greenspan has described the deficit as unsustainably high and said it would have to come down. The most common way for that to happen is for the dollar to drop in value, which would make imports more expensive and exports cheaper.
 But he has also suggested that the country may be able to borrow more because investors have become far less wedded to their home countries. This declining ''home bias,'' Mr. Greenspan said in a speech this month, ''has enabled the United States to incur and finance a much larger current account deficit than would have been feasible in earlier decades.''
 Many economists say Mr. Greenspan is correct about basic changes in the world.
 ''There is really nothing unusual in what he is saying, and I happen to agree with him,'' said Janet L. Yellin, a former Fed governor who teaches economics at the University of California at Berkeley.
 But others say they are increasingly uneasy. If foreign lenders lose their appetite for American securities, the dollar will fall and interest rates are likely to rise. If interest rates rise, and Fed officials have made it clear today's rates are unsustainably low, household debt payments are likely to rise and real estate values could decline.
 ''It really strains the imagination to believe that household balances are in that great shape,'' said David Rosenberg, a senior economist at Merrill Lynch. ''If you look at debt on a cash-flow basis, servicing the debt is not a great problem. But under a different interest rate scenario, the servicing costs become less manageable.''
 But J. Bradford DeLong, a longtime Fed watcher at the University of California at Berkeley, cautioned that Mr. Greenspan had been right when many others were wrong.
 ''I think he's wrong, but he's got a better track record than I have,'' Mr. DeLong said.

 CORRECTION:
A front-page headline yesterday about the views of Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, on debt levels in the United States characterized his position on budget deficits incorrectly. While Mr. Greenspan has urged Congress to avoid tax increases as a way of reducing such shortfalls, he continues to oppose budget deficits. He has not shifted his view.

HEADLINE: A.F.L.-C.I.O. To Press Bush For Penalties Against China

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSEand ELIZABETH BECKER; Steven Greenhouse reported for this article from New York and Elizabeth Becker from Washington.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 15 

 BODY:
The A.F.L.-C.I.O. will file an unusual trade complaint on Tuesday to press President Bush to punish China, which it asserts has gained a commercial advantage through violating workers' rights by suppressing strikes, banning independent trade unions and not enforcing minimum wage laws.
 Timed to maximize pressure on Mr. Bush as the presidential campaign heats up, the complaint asserts that the United States has lost up to 727,000 factory jobs because the labor violations it cites artificially lowered China's production costs and unfairly undercut American companies. 
 The A.F.L.-C.I.O. argues that this illegal repression of workers' rights translates into a 43 percent cost advantage on average for China.
 ''This will put the onus on the Bush administration to explain that China is not repressing workers' rights, and to me that is an extraordinarily difficult case to make,'' said James Mann, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ''The record going back for decades is that China has intensely resisted independent trade unions, and I don't see how the administration can pretend otherwise.'' 
 This is the first case ever brought under the Trade Act of 1974 that seeks penalties over violations of workers' rights. Some trade experts said the complaint could be vulnerable to challenge at the World Trade Organization because global trade rules do not protect labor rights.
 Concerned about the loss of nearly three million factory jobs since January 2001, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. is asking President Bush to impose punitive tariffs of up to 77 percent on China or to elicit a pledge to halt all such violations. Union leaders warned that rejecting the complaint would anger millions of American workers, especially in Midwestern battleground states where factory workers have been hit especially hard.
 ''American workers are suffering, they're losing their jobs, they're losing hope,'' said Barbara Shailor, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s director of international affairs. ''At the same time, Chinese workers are suffering under repressive conditions and are denied their most fundamental rights. Unless some action is taken to remedy this, we will see a continued hemorrhaging of jobs in the United States.''
 The complaint comes as the Bush administration prepares for next month's visit to Washington by China's vice premier, Wu Yi, who will discuss trade and commercial conflicts between the two countries.
 The A.F.L.-C.I.O., which represents 13 million American workers, plans to file the complaint under Section 301 of the trade act, which makes it an unfair trade practice for countries to violate internationally recognized workers' rights. 
 President Bush will have 45 days to decide whether to let the complaint proceed. If he lets it go forward, the International Trade Commission will have a year to rule on it. Trade experts said China would undoubtedly be angered if Mr. Bush allowed the complaint to go forward.
 A spokesman in the office of Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, declined to comment specifically on the complaint, saying it would be inappropriate until the office had reviewed it. However, the spokesman said in a statement, ''The United States is a leader in promoting internationally recognized labor standards and human rights globally, especially in countries where those standards are not fully upheld.'' 
 To buttress its position, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. cited the State Department's latest annual human rights report, which states that China ''continued to deny internationally recognized worker rights'' and has slid backward on arresting labor leaders.
 The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not respond to telephone inquiries.
 G. Hamilton Loeb, a lawyer who often represents China, said the unions' efforts would ultimately fail because global trade rules do not protect workers' rights and also bar one country from unilaterally punishing another over an issue not covered by those rules. 
 ''China takes its World Trade Organization commitments very seriously, but the W.T.O. standards do not extend into these labor issues,'' Mr. Loeb said. 
 Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, voiced sympathy with the unions' complaint, saying he would make workers' rights here and abroad a fundamental part of American trade policy.
 ''The Bush administration has completely walked away from using trade policy to raise living standards and improve the rights of workers at home and abroad,'' Mr. Kerry said in a statement. ''While I'm not familiar with all the details of this case, I believe that it marks an important challenge on behalf of American workers and raises real concerns about China's treatment of its workers.''
 The 105-page complaint sketches a nightmarish picture of factory workers in China. Citing reports by governments and human rights groups, the complaint says that strike leaders are often arrested and tortured. At many factories, independent labor unions are banned, and the only ones allowed are slavishly attached to the Communist Party's official union.
 Millions of peasants who migrate to urban factory jobs are frequently treated like bonded laborers, often working 18-hour days for half the minimum wage, the complaint asserts. They often live in prison-like dormitories, the complaint says, and often are unable to leave their jobs because their supervisors take their travel documents.
 Asserting that labor violations depress China's wages by 47 percent to 86 percent, the complaint asserts that wages in China would increase twofold to sevenfold if China allowed strikes and independent trade unions, enforced its minimum wage law and granted full legal protections to migrant workers. The complaint argued that without these artificially depressed wages and unfair competition, the United States would not have lost nearly 323,000 apparel and textile jobs the last two years.
 ''China's capacity is so vast and the labor repression so pervasive that together they create incredible downward push on wages and production in the rest of the world's economy,'' said Mark Levinson, chief economist for Unite, the nation's largest apparel union.
 The complaint asserts that the labor violations give China's producers an improper cost advantage of 10 percent to 77 percent, depending on which economic model is used. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. is requesting a punitive tariff of up to 77 percent and a pledge from China to comply with labor rights standards.
 ''The purpose of the trade remedies is not protectionist,'' the complaint says. ''They are, rather, intended to bring about positive change for China's workers and to ensure that global competition is fair for workers everywhere.''
 The complaint's main author is Mark Barenberg, a Columbia University law professor.
 Robert A. Kapp, president of the U.S.-China Business Council, said he thought China could not climb out of poverty while letting its hundreds of millions of workers organize independent unions for higher wages. He asserted that the American labor movement was making a ''colossal mistake'' by turning a complicated trade and development issue into a campaign issue.
 The complaint asserts that when China artificially depresses wages by violating workers' rights, it not only reduces wages and jobs in the United States but also hurts wages and jobs in Bangladesh, Indonesia and other third-world countries that compete with China. 
 These artificially depressed wages have fueled China's amazing manufacturing boom, the complaint contends, noting that China will add more factory jobs over the next five years than the total number of factory jobs in the United States, Europe and Japan. 
 ''China's trade practices with regard to repressing their people, and tolerating forced labor, child labor, no maximum hours, repressing people from joining unions are all unreasonable trade practices,'' said James P. Hoffa, president of the Teamsters, a union courted by the White House. 
 ''What that means for the American worker is they accelerate the number of jobs leaving the country.''

An article in Business Day yesterday about plans by the A.F.L.-C.I.O. to file a trade complaint to press President Bush to punish China over workers' rights paraphrased imprecisely from comments by Robert A. Kapp, president of the U.S.-China Business Council. He said that because many poor people in China would continue to seek work in modern factories, even a vast improvement in labor rights would probably not raise wages high enough to eliminate an unfair cost advantage. (He did not say China could not climb out of poverty while letting its workers organize independent unions for higher wages.)

HEADLINE: Deficit Study Disputes Role Of Economy

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 15 

 BODY:
When President Bush and his advisers talk about the widening federal budget deficit, they usually place part of the blame on economic shocks ranging from the recession of 2001 to the terrorist attacks that year. 
 But a report released on Monday by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that economic weakness would account for only 6 percent of a budget shortfall that could reach a record $500 billion this year.
 Next year, the agency predicted, faster economic growth will actually increase tax revenues even as the deficit remains at a relatively high level of $374 billion.
 The new numbers confirm what many analysts have predicted for some time: that budget deficits in the decade ahead will stem less from the lingering effects of the downturn and much more from rising government spending and progressively deeper tax cuts. 
 Administration officials do not dispute the basic thrust of the agency's estimate, but they still say that faster growth and spending restraints can reduce the deficit in five years. 
 Though the economy is growing at more than 4 percent a year, administration officials continue to attribute much of the budget deficit to economic problems beyond their control. ''Large and unwelcome as they are, the deficits are understandable,'' Treasury Secretary John W. Snow said in a speech last week. ''They are understandable in the sense that the president inherited a recession and an economy greatly weakened by the excesses of the late 90's.''
 President Bush and his advisers almost routinely cite a list of shocks to the economy, from a recession that began as Mr. Bush took office to the terrorist attacks and the loss of investor confidence after a series of corporate scandals.
 Joshua B. Bolten, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, summed up the burdens when he presented Mr. Bush's latest budget proposal and predicted a deficit of $521 billion for this year. ''Like America itself, the federal budget has faced extraordinary challenges in recent years,'' he said, citing ''a stock market collapse that began in early 2000; a recession that was fully under way in early 2001; revelation of corporate scandals years in the making; and, of course, the Sept. 11 attacks and ensuing war on terror.''
 The Congressional report, though, concludes that the ''cyclical'' problems of slower growth are a tiny part of the overall budget problem. The Congressional agency estimated that slower growth reduced tax revenues by $53 billion in 2002, accounting for a third of the budget deficit that year. In 2003, the agency estimated that subpar growth cut tax revenues by $68 billion. The overall budget deficit in 2002 swelled to $375 billion as a result of spending on the Iraq war and Mr. Bush's tax cuts.
 But this year, with the economy expanding, the Congressional agency predicted that lingering weakness would drain only $30 billion in tax revenues while the deficit hits $477 billion, less than the White House had forecast, but still a record.
 Critics of the Bush administration said the new report meant that budget problems were increasingly the result of legislative changes, from higher military spending to deeper tax cuts, rather than temporary economic distress.
 ''What the Bush administration has tried over and over again to do is blame deficits on events outside their control,'' said Thomas S. Kahn, chief of staff for Democrats on the House Budget Committee. ''The C.B.O. report is confirmation that the Bush administration has locked us into long-term structural deficits that will take some very tough decisions to wipe out.''
 But J. T. Young, a spokesman for the White House budget office, said the administration was confident it could reduce the annual budget deficit by half over the next five years.
 Mr. Young cautioned that increases in tax revenues often lagged behind increased economic growth, and he noted that the budget was still being affected by higher costs for the military and domestic security.
 ''The economic downturn was only one of the shocks,'' Mr. Young said. ''Even though the recession is over, we still have to spend what is necessary in the war on terrorism.''
 Brian M. Reidl, a senior budget analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group, said control over government spending would be crucial. He said the agency report projected a 42 percent rise in spending from 1999 through 2005, but a tax revenue increase of only 19 percent. ''Economic booms are not forever, but government programs are,'' Mr. Reidl said. ''In the absence of real spending reform, the deficits are not going to go down.''

HEADLINE: Bush Visits Pennsylvania To Promote Homeowning

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: ARDMORE, Pa., March 15 

 BODY:
President Bush brought his campaign to the suburbs of Philadelphia on Monday, seeking to appeal to the moderate voters he needs if he is to bring Pennsylvania into his column in November.
 Mr. Bush did not mention Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts during his two stops here, a visit intended to highlight his administration's efforts to promote homeownership among low-income Americans. The closest he came to overt partisanship was his call to avoid ''economic isolationism,'' as he refers to the trade policies advocated by many Democrats, and his plea for Congress to extend elements of his tax cut that would otherwise expire at the end of the year. The elements include an increase in the child credit and a break for married couples. 
 But the political overtones of the trip, which was billed to taxpayers, were clear even before he took off for the Philadelphia area aboard Air Force One. Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, who is up for re-election this year, told reporters on the plane that he had spoken to Mr. Bush and Karl Rove, the president's senior adviser, and that they hoped to eat into the traditional Democratic advantage in Philadelphia and the surrounding suburbs of southeastern Pennsylvania.
 It was Mr. Bush's 26th visit to Pennsylvania since he took office. The state went to Al Gore in 2000 by a little over four percentage points. Along with Michigan, it is near the top of a list of states that went Democratic last time but that the White House appears serious about contesting. To win, members of both parties say, the president must reach out well beyond his conservative base.
 ''His message today is designed to appeal to moderates and independents and Democrats, going after an issue, in housing, that's very important,'' Mr. Specter said.
 Mr. Bush first stopped by a row of new houses in Ardmore bought by low-income Pennsylvanians with help from government programs. Chants of ''No more Bush'' from demonstrators several blocks away were audible as Mr. Bush strolled by the two-family houses. He posed for pictures and went inside the house owned by Pearl Cerdan, whom the White House identified as a certified nursing assistant and first-time home buyer who moved into the house 16 months ago with help from a government program.
 He then rode to a Y.M.C.A., where in front of signs set up by the White House saying ''A Home of Your Own,'' he talked about a statistic the administration often cites in asserting that the economy is getting stronger. ''Homeownership in America is at the highest rate ever,'' he said to applause. ''It's a fantastic statement to say that, isn't it?''
 Mr. Bush alluded only briefly to the biggest economic issue of the campaign so far, the economy's failure to generate large numbers of new jobs. Even though the recovery has been under way for well over two years, fueled in part by the tax cuts Mr. Bush has always sold as the best medicine for stagnant employment, job creation has remained well below the levels predicted by the White House and many private economists.
 Mr. Specter said Mr. Bush's economic record would hold up well in Pennsylvania, in part because of the president's decision in 2002 to impose tariffs on imported steel. This was considered a boon to Pennsylvania, which like most other industrial states has been shedding manufacturing jobs. The tariffs were lifted late last year.

SECTION: Section A; Column 3; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 1; CASH FOR TRASH: Enron in Connecticut

LENGTH: 2641 words

HEADLINE: The Garbage and the Governor: Enron in Impeachment Inquiry

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

DATELINE: GLASTONBURY, Conn. 

 BODY:
Most people who visit the town dump here do not seem to realize they are quite literally holding the bag for a piece of the Enron debacle every time they toss out their trash.
 But now as Gov. John G. Rowland tries to stave off impeachment, the most expensive misjudgment of his tenure -- a failed deal with Enron that cost the State of Connecticut $220 million -- is generating attention on multiple fronts. It is the subject of lawsuits and inquiries by federal investigators, a state grand jury and the legislative panel that will recommend whether Mr. Rowland is impeached. 
 A suit filed in January by the town of New Hartford names the governor as a defendant and alleges that the Enron deal was but one way the state's trash authority, the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority, was used to reward the governor and people close to him. 
 Billed in 2001 as an energy trade by the trash authority, because it involved electricity generated by burning trash, the deal has since been characterized by Attorney General Richard Blumenthal as an illegal, unsecured loan to a company desperate for cash. Residents in 70 towns and cities served by the authority, representing 30 percent of the state's population, are now paying higher bills to make up for the loss.
 Connecticut was hardly the only state victimized by Enron. But Mr. Rowland's dealings with the trash authority and with Enron, as revealed in records, interviews and news accounts, reflect the ethical issues surrounding his administration writ large. 
 They involve a little-watched trash authority, run by one of the governor's top aides, whose stewards became adept at turning trash into cash for well-connected insiders; a law firm that was on both sides of the deal; and a politically astute company skilled at using contributions and contacts to gain influence and government contracts.
 ''It's another one of a series of relationships that the governor had with major state contractors and employees that raises all kinds of very legitimate questions,'' said Michael Lawlor, a Democratic member of the impeachment panel.
 Mr. Rowland, a Republican, insists he did nothing wrong and played no role in the deal with Enron. The governor's spokesman, Dean Pagani, said the deal was approved by the entire trash authority board, Democrats and Republicans alike. ''They all voted on it because it was seen as a good deal,'' he said. ''Then Enron went bankrupt, and everything changed.''
 In the past, the relationship with Enron and the trash authority deals has dogged the governor but failed to gain traction as a major liability. Now, in the context of the ethical issues plaguing his administration, they are raising fresh questions about whether his administration habitually rewarded friends, contributors and powerful insiders. And this time the stakes are much higher than a hot tub or gutter work at a lakeside cottage.

Golden Trash
 The town dump here is a marvel of efficiency and New England thrift. All day long, residents looking to save a few dollars by not hiring a hauling service arrive in cars full of trash.
 The annual cost to unload is $90 to $210, depending on the size of the car. But the cost to throw away anything at home or at the dump is going up sharply here and in the 69 other towns and cities that send their trash to an incinerator in Hartford as partners in the Mid-Connecticut Project of the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority, which arranged the Enron deal. ''Someone should be held accountable,'' said Kevin Dalton, a Glastonbury resident. 
 The authority was established in 1973 simply to collect trash and burn it, producing electricity that it sold. But as a quasi-public entity, the trash authority has always had more freedom than state agencies do. Its employees could make more than government workers, and its expense account reimbursements were rarely looked at by state auditors. In those years, the governor appointed 4 of the 13 board members outright, and 3 more indirectly. 
 Under Mr. Rowland, the trash authority began to change. In 1997, he appointed his economic development commissioner, Peter Ellef, as the trash authority's chairman. Later that year, the governor also made Mr. Ellef his co-chief of staff.
 Mr. Ellef, whose lawyer, Hugh F. Keefe, declined to comment, no longer works for the governor or the trash authority. He has been a central figure in the federal investigation into corruption in the Rowland administration ever since his deputy in the governor's office, Lawrence E. Alibozek, pleaded guilty last March to having accepted cash and gold coins in exchange for steering state business to favored contractors.
 Under Mr. Ellef, the trash agency became involved with a lot more than trash.
 Documents turned over to federal investigators last year show that it commissioned a compensation survey of other nonprofit groups, which was then used to argue for higher pay. The authority was extremely generous about expense reimbursement, covering everything from part of Mr. Ellef's stay at the Chateau Frontenac in Quebec to another executive's purchases at Toys ''R'' Us.
 The authority also filled its ranks with politically connected people like Mary A. Bergenty, the girlfriend of William A. Tomasso, a construction executive whose company is at the heart of the federal investigation into bid-rigging. A recycling and enforcement supervisor, Ms. Bergenty did not return phone calls seeking comment.
 The trash authority also began paying $4,000 a month plus expenses to Linda Kowalski, a Hartford lobbyist who had close ties to the governor's office and whom Mr. Rowland had asked to help raise money for the Republican Governors Association.
 When some $27,000 of her spending was questioned, the governor's office repaid some of it and Ms. Kowalski put much of the money in escrow, pending resolution of the issue. Ms. Kowalski's lawyer, R. Bartley Halloran, said that all the spending was properly authorized, and that ''she did not have anything to do with the Enron transaction.'' 
 Another one of the trash authority's early deals under Mr. Ellef was a $500,000 grant in 1998 to a consortium the authority formed with the National Geographic Society in Washington, to finance a program to teach geography. The chairman of the society then was Gilbert Grosvenor, a cousin of Mr. Rowland's.
 Asked in February about the grant, the trash authority's current president, Thomas D. Kirk, said the authority was trying to get its money back.
 Another deal involved transferring title to a fleet of trucks, potentially worth $1 million, to Connecticut Waste Processing in Plainville, Conn., in 2001.
 Its owners, the Manafort family, had contributed heavily to Mr. Rowland's campaigns. Their company was supplying the drivers who used those vehicles to haul garbage from the trash authority's transfer stations to the incinerator in Hartford. The deal was described at the time as a way for the trash authority to lower its maintenance costs and reduce its liability. But it also allowed the company to use the trucks any way it wished during the contract and to keep them after it expired.
 Mr. Kirk said the trash authority's new board was ''not comfortable'' with that decision and had him renegotiate it last year. In an interview, Jason Manafort, the company's president, said that the initial transfer of the trucks was requested by the trash authority solely to reduce the authority's potential liability. ''There was no other motivation,'' he said.
 But critics say the pattern of misuse of the authority's resources is clear. Barbara Surwilo, former mayor of the town of Rocky Hill, said the National Geographic deal should have been a tipoff.
 ''They made a run at that to see if they could get at the wealth accumulating inside C.R.R.A.,'' said Ms. Surwilo, whose town named the governor and other defendants in a lawsuit over the trash authority and then withdrew it, fearing that a suit against the governor could cost them approval of bond projects. ''And when they found out how easy the pickings were, this whole deal with Enron was easy.''

Enron's Opportunity
 Connecticut was hardly the only state of interest to Enron, the energy giant, which became one of the most dazzling corporate success stories of the 90's before collapsing into accounting scandals and bankruptcy in 2001. Under deregulation, utilities were to use their best efforts to unwind long-term supply contracts, like the one under which Connecticut Light and Power had to buy the steam that the Mid-Connecticut project's incinerator in Hartford produces as it burns trash.
 Connecticut Light and Power was obliged to buy the steam for at least 8.5 cents a kilowatt-hour through 2012. Because the going rate was closer to 3 cents, the contract was very valuable to the trash authority.
 Connecticut Light and Power understood that it would have to pay to break the contract. On March 31, 1999, it signed a memorandum of understanding stating that it was prepared to pay the trash authority nearly $300 million to get out of the deal. The trash authority was unsure what to do with the windfall, but figured it would come up with a plan.
 By April, state ethics filings show, Enron had engaged the law firm of Murtha Cullina, its frequent lobbyist in Connecticut. For years, the firm had also represented the trash authority as its general counsel.
 One of its lead lobbyists was Michael Martone, an old friend of the governor. Mr. Martone had also worked in the governor's office during his first term and had been his political director for the 1998 re-election campaign. According to testimony by Mr. Ellef, it was Mr. Martone who introduced Enron to Mr. Ellef in the summer of 2000. Mr. Martone did not return phone calls seeking comment.
 About this time, Enron also began donating heavily to the Republican Governors' Association, where Mr. Rowland was active. Between April and November 2000, Enron and people associated with it gave nearly $500,000 to the group's fund-raising arm, election filings show. The company also became a regular contributor to Mr. Rowland's campaigns.
 The governors' group was just one way the company was working to win Connecticut's business.
 One person Enron went to for help was Anthony W. Ravosa Jr., a Republican fund-raiser from Glastonbury who later raised $50,000 for Mr. Rowland's 2002 re-election campaign.
 Mr. Rowland has acknowledged that because of Mr. Ravosa, ''a good friend,'' the governor played host to him and three Enron executives in his office on Dec. 18, 2000. The governor said the get-together was a chance to get acquainted and perhaps chat about a pet project, the use of fuel cells as an alternative energy source. He has said that the Connecticut Light and Power deal was never discussed.
 Nonetheless, 10 days after the meeting in the governor's office, Enron made inroads on both fronts.
 It signed a memorandum of understanding in which the state pledged to pursue a $124 million fuel cell deal, which would have entitled Enron to a 10 percent development fee. According to the New Hartford lawsuit, some of the construction work was to go to the Tomasso companies.
 On Dec. 28, 2000, Enron also worked itself into the deal with Connecticut Light and Power.
 Here's how that deal worked. Connecticut Light and Power would put up $280 million in cash to buy out the contract. The trash authority would use some of that money to buy land and assets near the incinerator in Hartford and clean up the site. Most of the cash, $220 million, would be handed over to Enron.
 On paper, Enron was promising to buy power from the incinerator. But the price equaled what Connecticut Light and Power was agreeing to pay Enron for the same power, and the power was to be delivered to the utility, bypassing Enron completely.
 Enron's only obligation was to pay $2.375 million a month to the trash authority until 2012. It was exactly what Enron would have paid had it borrowed $220 million at 7 percent annual interest. Using Enron satisfied the trash authority's desire to have an annual stream of payments to support the Mid-Connecticut Project, rather than a huge lump sum to manage.
 The three-page summary of the deal given to the board spoke only of a ''lump sum payment'' to Enron. Nowhere did it mention that the payment was for $220 million.
 And if the directors failed to realize that lending $220 million to a private entity exceeded their authority, as the trash authority's new management now contends, they have a likely excuse. Murtha Cullina, the same firm that was lobbying for Enron, advised the authority in a letter dated Dec. 28, 2000, that the transaction was proper.
 William Prout, the lawyer representing Murtha Cullina, said the firm's representation of the authority was ''appropriate in all respects.'' He said the claim against Mr. Martone in one suit also ''has no merit.''

Holding the Bag
 On March 31, 2001, $220 million of the money Connecticut Light and Power owed the trash authority was conveyed to Enron in a no-bid deal that left taxpayers with no protection in case of default.
 Enron spent the next eight months pushing other deals with the trash authority: the $124 million fuel cell deal that did not happen and a deal to buy paper for recycling at an unusually low price that did.
 Throughout this period, Enron's donations to the governors' group and to Mr. Rowland's re-election campaign kept coming. On Oct. 16, 2001, the same day that Enron announced a $1.2 billion write-down, the Republican Governors' Association's fund-raising arm received a $60,000 gift from Enron, election filings show. Mr. Rowland had become the group's chairman 11 days earlier.
 Filings show Enron and its associates gave $686,222 to the governors' group's fund-raising arm and $57,750 to Mr. Rowland's election campaign in the 20 months before its collapse.
 Harvey Valentine, a spokesman for the governors' group, said that his group had once been a subsidiary of the Republican National Committee, so that figure includes money that went to other national committee business as well as to the governors' group.
 The deal-making abruptly halted on Dec. 2, 2001, when Enron filed for bankruptcy protection. 
 Since then the issue has flared intermittently, first when Mr. Rowland's Democratic challenger Bill Curry tried, mostly unsuccessfully, to make it a campaign issue, later when e-mails surfaced showing Mr. Rowland's involvement. Bankruptcy lawyers are trying to recover some of the lost money from Enron's estate. Connecticut's attorney general has sued 92 different parties he holds responsible, most out of state.
 The trash authority is moving to cheaper digs. The legislature has replaced the entire trash authority board and changed it so the governor now names only 3 of its 11 members.
 Now the Enron deal is getting a sustained look by those searching for evidence of corruption in the Rowland administration and by those looking for deep pockets to sue.
 But the deal's very complexity has made it daunting to investigate. That is especially so with the impeachment panel's feeling some urgency to make its recommendations by this spring. ''Whether or not it's possible to get one's arms around it in time to include it in the decision we need to make is hard to say right now,'' said Mr. Lawlor, a Democrat on the impeachment panel.
 Still, in light of the other issues, the deal rankles now as never before.
 Wilken Mahland, who was bringing his empty pizza boxes to the dump in Glastonbury recently, said he, for one, would love to have some answers. ''I keep wondering how someone gives away $220 million,'' he said.
 Still, he was not sure if lawsuits against the governor and his associates had much potential. ''Who would we sue?'' he asked. ''What are we going to grab? His hot tub? What do we get, a motorcycle? These guys aren't worth $220 million put together.''

HEADLINE: Observer Team in Russia Lists Election Flaws

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

DATELINE: MOSCOW, March 15 

 BODY:
International election observers on Monday criticized Russia's presidential election for falling short of basic democratic standards, even as President Vladimir V. Putin accepted congratulatory telephone calls from presidents and prime ministers of the world's leading democracies. 
 The observers -- representing the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe -- cited the misuse of government resources, bias in state news media and even instances of ballot stuffing on Election Day. 
 ''The election process over all did not adequately reflect principles necessary for a healthy democratic election process,'' the chief of the observer mission, Julian Peel Yates, said at a news conference. ''Essential elements of the O.S.C.E. commitments and Council of Europe standards for democratic elections, such as a vibrant political discourse and meaningful pluralism, were lacking.'' 
 Mr. Putin swept to an entirely expected re-election victory on Sunday, receiving 72.1 percent of the vote, after a campaign that featured overwhelming support of the incumbent from local governments and the state-controlled news media. Nikolai M. Kharitonov, representing the Communist Party, came in a distant second with just under 14 percent, election officials said after most of the votes had been counted. The rest of the field failed to break out of single digits. 
 Mr. Putin, appearing at his campaign headquarters in the wee hours after the polls closed on Sunday night, gently brushed aside earlier American criticism from Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and the national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice. He did not address the observers' assessment.
 President Bush called to congratulate Mr. Putin, as did Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, President Jacques Chirac of France, Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany and Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi of Japan.
 Mr. Bush's spokesman, Scott McClellan, said Mr. Bush had emphasized that Mr. Putin had ''an opportunity to deepen Russia's commitment to reform, market-based reform and democratic reform.''
 The congratulatory calls reflected not only diplomatic niceties, but also, said a senior American diplomat, who insisted on anonymity in accordance with diplomatic practice, the importance of Russia's role in a variety of economic and diplomatic issues -- from Iraq to North Korea to oil -- despite concerns about the nature of Mr. Putin's re-election campaign.
 While no one called Mr. Putin's victory fraudulent, given his obvious popularity, the observers and his challengers cited biased news coverage and favoritism from election officials that, according to the international observers report, ''reflected a lack of a democratic culture, accountability and responsibility.''
 The report cited at least two instances of outright falsification of votes at polling places in Moscow and Khabarovsk, but Mr. Yates declined to comment on the effect any of the reported abuses might have had on the outcome.
 In Chechnya, battered by more than four years of a war under his leadership, Mr. Putin received more than 92 percent of the vote, according to the official results. The Moscow Times quoted election officials in the republic's capital, Grozny, acknowledging that they had filled in several thousand ballots for Mr. Putin.<M03,20,40,20> --------------------

Censure Sought on Chechnya	By The New York Times	 GENEVA, March 15 -- The European Union is seeking a vote at the annual meeting here of the United Nations Human Rights Commission to censure Russia over human rights abuses committed by its forces in Chechnya, diplomats said Monday. The annual meeting of the 53-nation group opened on Sunday and runs until April 23. 
 ''The Russian government must honor fully its responsibility to protect human rights in the northern Caucasus,'' the German foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, said at the opening session. ''All human rights abuses committed there should be investigated and those responsible brought to justice.'' 
 There is growing alarm in Europe about the influx of Chechen refugees from Russia. 
 Moscow defends its tough approach in Chechnya as necessary in its own campaign against terrorism. Last year, Russia was able to use various tactics to prevent a vote of censure, and it is likely to succeed in doing so this year, too.

HEADLINE: Nation's Direction Prompts Voters' Concern, Poll Finds

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY and JANET ELDER; Fred Backus contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
George Bush and John Kerry enter the general election at a time of growing concern among Americans that the nation is veering in the wrong direction, the latest New York Times/CBS News poll shows. Mr. Bush faces unrest over his management of the economy, while the public has doubts about Mr. Kerry's political convictions.
 Americans do view Mr. Bush and Mr. Kerry as strong leaders who share their moral values and have a clear vision of where they want to take the country, the poll found. 
 But while the candidates are starting on roughly equal ground on those critical generic measures of leadership, the poll found that nearly half of respondents have not yet formed an opinion about Mr. Kerry. That result suggests that Mr. Bush has an opening to mold public opinion of his largely unknown challenger. 
 Already, most voters think Mr. Kerry is a politician who says what people want to hear, the poll found, rather than what he believes -- the line of attack Mr. Bush has used against him in speeches.
 At the same time, there is sweeping concern among Americans about the president's economic policies, including his ability to create jobs and the effectiveness of his tax cuts, according to the poll. By a margin of greater than 30 points, more people said the policies of Mr. Bush's administration had reduced the number of jobs in the country rather than increased them. Those findings could prove particularly significant if the election is fought over economic issues in hard-hit states like Ohio.
 Perhaps most significant for Mr. Bush, the number of Americans who think that the nation is heading in the wrong direction is now 54 percent, as high as it has been in his presidency. The right direction/wrong direction figure is a measure that pollsters view as a highly reliable early indicator of problems for an incumbent.
 ''Our priorities need to be reshuffled,'' Darrell Griffin, 64, a Republican retired engineer from Hemphill, Tex., said in a follow-up interview. ''The protection of the homeland and our allies from terrorism is important, but our economy in our own country and Social Security and things like that here at home are pretty important, too. ''
 The Times/CBS News poll offered the latest evidence that the race for president was as tight as has long been predicted. Even after two weeks in which Mr. Bush has run televised advertisements promoting himself and attacking Mr. Kerry, and in which Mr. Kerry has enjoyed the glow of favorable coverage that greeted his near-sweep of Democratic primaries, the two men are effectively tied, with 46 percent of voters saying they supported Mr. Bush and 43 percent backing Mr. Kerry.
 The candidacy of Ralph Nader looms as a potentially lethal threat to Democratic hopes of regaining the White House: With Mr. Nader in the race, Mr. Bush leads Mr. Kerry by 46 percent to 38 percent, with Mr. Nader drawing 7 percent of the votes. In a sign of the polarized electorate Mr. Bush and Mr. Kerry are facing, three-quarters of supporters of each candidate asserted they would not change their mind before the election. 
 The nationwide telephone poll of 1,206 adults, including 984 registered voters, was taken from last Wednesday through Sunday. It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
 The questioning was completed before the vote in Spain on Sunday that produced in the ouster of one of Mr. Bush's principal allies in the Iraq war, the party of Jose Maria Aznar. The vote followed a terrorist bombing there that has been linked to Al Qaeda.
 The Times/CBS News poll found that Mr. Bush continued to enjoy an advantage over Mr. Kerry in managing foreign policy, and in protecting the nation against terrorism. Indeed, fighting terrorism remains Mr. Bush's greatest area of strength.
 But the poll suggested other potential obstacles as Mr. Bush moves into his re-election campaign. 
 After a month in which Mr. Bush called for a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage, he is viewed in sharply ideological terms, with more than 50 percent of voters describing him as conservative, again as high as it has been during his presidency. The finding suggests the risks Mr. Bush faces as he tries to build up his standing with conservative members of his party, and the challenge he faces as he seeks to expand his support. 
 By 59 percent to 35 percent, respondents said they supported a constitutional amendment that would ''allow marriage only between a man and a woman.'' But 56 percent said that they did not view the issue as important enough to merit changing the nation's constitution.
 ''It seems like a waste of time and energy when we should be thinking more about figuring out how we're going to have Social Security,'' said Ronald Sharp, 44, a Republican and retired mental health care aide from Detroit. 
 Nearly two-thirds of respondents said it was unacceptable for candidates to use images from the World Trade Center's destruction in political advertisements. Mr. Bush is running an advertisement that shows the aftermath of the attack on Sept. 11, 2001, and has refused to take it off the air in the face of criticism by Mr. Kerry's allies, firefighters and some families of victims.
 ''They shouldn't exploit what happened to make a political issue,'' said Nan McNeill, 56, a Republican ranch owner in Tonopah, Ariz. ''The fact that it happened is something that no one can deny, but no political party can actually say this is what should have been done or shouldn't have been done, so I don't think that it should be an issue at all.''
 But the biggest difficulty for Mr. Bush is the perception of his management of the economy. The number of Americans who say they approve of his economic record is now among the lowest of his presidency, 38 percent. In addition, 57 percent of voters said they were uneasy about Mr. Bush's ability to make the right decision on the economy, compared with just 39 percent who said they had confidence in his economic-decision making. Voters were evenly split over whether they were uneasy or confident about Mr. Kerry's ability to make economic decisions.
 Mr. Kerry is viewed by Americans as much more likely to succeed at creating jobs and improving the economy than Mr. Bush. He also is viewed as more likely to protect Social Security and hold down the cost of drugs, two areas that could give him an advantage with the elderly voters.
 But at the start of what Mr. Bush's advisers said would be an intensive campaign to raise questions about Mr. Kerry's ideology and political convictions, the poll found that 39 percent of respondents considered Mr. Kerry a liberal -- a characterization the Republicans have been encouraging.
 And by 57 percent to 33 percent, respondents said that Mr. Kerry says what people want to hear, rather than what he believes in. By contrast, 45 percent said Mr. Bush says what people want to hear, while 51 percent said he says what he means.
 ''He seems to change his mind or his opinion about things depending on whom he's talking to,'' David Carpenter, 78, an independent and retired engineer from Wakefield, Mass., said of Mr. Kerry. ''He just tries to appease those that are in front of him, and as a result he isn't consistent. The lack of consistency indicates to me that he's trying to appease the people that he's talking to or appeal to them rather than sticking to a straight line. He's done it with the war in Iraq.''
 The poll reflected the clear unease among Americans over marriages, or civil unions, by same-sex couples. Nearly two-thirds of respondents said they believed the issue did not merit being part of a presidential campaign. 
 And while the public supports an amendment to allow marriage between only a man and a woman, 22 percent said they supported allowing gay marriage, while another 33 percent said they supported permitting gay couples to form civil unions.

How the Poll Was Conducted
 The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Wednesday through Sunday with 1,206 adults throughout the United States. Of these, 984 said they were registered to vote.
 The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active residential exchanges across the country. Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to listed and unlisted numbers alike. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
 The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variation in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race, age and education.
 In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
 For smaller subgroups the margin of sampling error is larger.
 In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variation in the wording and order of questions, for example, may lead to somewhat different results.

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about growing unease among Americans as the presidential election season gets under way misattributed a comment about the use of images from the World Trade Center attacks in political advertisements. It was Ronald Sharp, 44, a Republican who is a retired mental health aide from Detroit, who said, ''They shouldn't exploit what happened to make a political issue'' and ''The fact that it happened is something that no one can deny, but no political party can actually say this is what should have been done or shouldn't have been done, so I don't think that it should be an issue at all.'' It was not Nan McNeill, 56, a Republican ranch owner in Tonopah, Ariz.

HEADLINE: Jets Campaign for a Manhattan Stadium

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The Jets are pressing hard to win the hearts and minds of New Yorkers for the team's proposed $1.4 billion stadium that would rise over the rail yards on the far west side of Midtown Manhattan.
 In the latest round of barroom presentations, breakfast talks, Jets fests-in-the-park, endorsements and deals, some of the city's most prominent union leaders are expected to announce their support for the stadium on Thursday at a noontime news conference near the west side yards.
 The construction unions are often used as the shock troops for real estate developers eager to counter community opposition, and the stadium effort is no exception. But organizers of the news conference have invited a broader array of labor leaders, including Peter Ward, president of the 25,500-member Hotel and Motel Trades Council, and Brian M. McLaughlin, president of the Central Labor Council, the governing body for New York City unions. 
 Of course, Mr. Ward's endorsement comes with a price: the Jets have to agree to let the union sign up workers at the four high-end restaurants the Jets plan for the stadium. It is a small but important step in an effort that the Jets hope will demonstrate the breadth of support for the project. ''We're down to the wire,'' said L. Jay Cross, president of the Jets. ''We want to be under construction within the next 12 to 15 months. We really want to ratchet up the amount of information that's available to the public.'' 
 The sense of urgency comes from the Jets' desire to complete the stadium, which would double as an Olympic forum if the city wins its bid for the 2012 Olympic Games, before their lease runs out at the New Jersey Meadowlands in 2008. The city also wants to demonstrate some progress on the stadium by May 19, when the International Olympic Committee is expected to winnow its list of candidates for the 2012 summer games.
 The Jets, the Bloomberg administration and state officials say the stadium, which requires a $600 million public subsidy, would provide an additional benefit because it could be used for conventions and trade shows in conjunction with the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center.
 The Jets have hired a small army of lobbyists and consultants, including former aides to Gov. George E. Pataki -- Mike McKeon and Louis R. Tomson -- and strategists with ties to labor, minorities and Democrats -- Ken Sunshine and Bill Lynch. The Jets also hired Mr. Tomson's former aide at the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, Matt Higgins, as vice president.
 The stadium has come in for criticism from local residents, politicians and some Broadway theater owners, who fear that the stadium would bring traffic congestion, displace Broadway-related businesses and discourage people from visiting the theater district. ''Neighborhood feeling is as strong as it's ever been, or stronger, in opposition to the stadium,'' Assemblyman Richard N. Gottfried said. ''I don't think that's going to change by inviting them to parties or press conferences.'' In recent weeks, the team has gone into hyperdrive to answer critics and convince political leaders and New Yorkers that a West Side stadium will be great.
 At a Feb. 25 meeting scheduled by Community Board 4 to discuss the issues surrounding the stadium and West Side development, dozens of construction workers arrived early, dressed in green Jets caps and chanting ''J-E-T-S; Jobs.''
 Herman Edwards, the Jets head coach, addressed the annual Black, Puerto Rican and Hispanic Legislative Caucus dinner on Feb. 15. He gave an inspirational talk about leadership and tacked on a plug for the stadium, said three politicians who attended.
 ''It wasn't really a centerpiece of his speech,'' said Adriano Espaillat, chairman of the caucus and a Manhattan assemblyman. ''For the most part, the audience wasn't really tuned into it.''
 Mr. Espaillat opposes the stadium. ''All the research indicates that stadiums are one-shot deals and not a significant stimulus to local economies,'' he said. ''I think it'll be a traffic nightmare all the way up to the George Washington Bridge, and it'll adversely affect the economy.''
 The Jets had a news conference on the steps of City Hall on March 4 to show that support for the project was surging, with the help of minority legislators and former Olympic athletes. There were only three politicians in attendance: Assemblymen Keith L. Wright and Darryl C. Towns and Councilwoman Margarita Lopez. Mr. Towns represents a Brooklyn district; the two others are from Manhattan.
 The team saw a better turnout at a gathering of about 30 bars owners last Tuesday at O'Farrell's, a bar at 10th Avenue and 33rd Street, even if some of them were from East Side bars. Team officials presented striking designs for the stadium, its connections to the Javits Center and its potential economic impact.
 ''I think the bar owners are going to be behind it,'' said Jim Breidenbach, manager of P&G Cafe on Amsterdam Avenue near 73rd Street.
 On Sunday, the team sponsored a ''Jets Fest'' at a West Side park, complete with Jets players, that drew several hundred people, including opponents who passed out leaflets indicating that they loved the team and hated the stadium.
 Yesterday, Councilman David I. Weprin, chairman of the City Council's finance committee, held a news conference outside City Hall with Mr. Cross. Mr. Weprin said his analysis of economic data, which he acknowledged was mostly provided by the Jets, led him to conclude that ''this is a great deal for the city.''
 Mr. Weprin said he was speaking for himself and not for other members of the City Council, among whom opinion on the project is divided.
 ''They're not going to turn things around on the West Side,'' Assemblyman Thomas K. Duane said. ''Mayor Giuliani tried to stuff a baseball stadium down our throats and it didn't work.''

HEADLINE: Terrorism and the Spanish Vote

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 The surprise election victory for Spain's Socialists on Sunday (front page, March 15) will no doubt worry Tony Blair and President Bush. 
 Despite Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's solid economic performance, his highly unpopular involvement of Spain in Iraq may have been the catalyst for change after the terror attacks of March 11.
 The Spanish people have sent a clear message to leaders like Tony Blair, Silvio Berlusconi of Italy and George W. Bush: far from eradicating and protecting us from terrorism, their insensitive actions have in many ways brought the likelihood of Islamic terrorist attacks a step closer. 
 By practically abandoning Middle East peace initiatives and invading Iraq without a clear mandate, they have incurred an elevated level of anger from the Muslim world, which is feeling increasingly isolated.

HEADLINE: Haiti's New Leader Said to Pick Cabinet, Shunning Politicians

BYLINE: By KIRK SEMPLE; Lydia Polgreen contributed reporting from Kingston, Jamaica, for this article.

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, March 16 

 BODY:
Haiti's interim prime minister, moving quickly to prevent the country from sinking into further disarray, reportedly settled on a list of cabinet members on Tuesday amid a regional quarrel over Jamaica's decision to receive Haiti's exiled president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
 Prime Minister Gerard Latortue, who was appointed last week, faces the task of forming an interim government that can begin reactivating the public and private sectors and winning the confidence of the Haitian people, who have suffered through months of political uncertainty. Mr. Aristide fled into exile on Feb. 29 under pressure from rebels and the American and French governments. 
 Officials involved in the cabinet selection said Mr. Latortue had decided on at least 12 ministerial posts on Tuesday plus several other cabinet members. The prime minister is expected to make the formal appointments on Wednesday.
 The ministers chosen so far, according to officials close to the selection process, are mostly technocrats who have not been deeply involved in politics; the exclusion of politicians has reportedly angered some of the country's political parties on Tuesday, including Mr. Aristide's Lavalas Party. Mr. Latortue has said he intends to build a government of national reconciliation. The cabinet will run the country until elections are held.
 The reported list of cabinet members includes Herard Abraham, a former general, as minister of public security; Bernard Gousse, a well-known lawyer, as minister of justice; and Yvon Simeon as minister of foreign affairs.
 Meanwhile, diplomatic wrangling between Haiti's new government and Jamaica, which has provided temporary refuge to Mr. Aristide, continued on Tuesday.
 Mr. Aristide spent the day in a heavily guarded house in a retreat owned by the Jamaican government in the hills near the resort town of Ocho Rios, and Jamaican officials said they would not recognize Haiti's new government until the issue was discussed at a meeting of the 15-member Caribbean economic bloc, the Caribbean Community, or Caricom, later this month.
 On Monday, Mr. Latortue said he was withdrawing his ambassador from Kingston and suspending diplomatic relations with Jamaica and Caricom over their decisions to side with Mr. Aristide. The Haitian ambassador had actually left Jamaica last week, part of a mass recall of ambassadors undertaken after Mr. Aristide left Haiti, officials in Jamaica said.
 Since fleeing Haiti, Mr. Aristide has claimed that he was forced from power by an American-backed coup and whisked into exile against his will. He says he is still president of Haiti. American officials deny the accusations.
 President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, who has grown increasingly hostile toward the United States in recent speeches, jumped into the regional diplomatic fray on Tuesday, saying he would not recognize the new government of Haiti and offering Mr. Aristide refuge in Venezuela.
 American officials have joined Mr. Latortue in criticizing the Jamaican government's decision to allow Mr. Aristide's visit, saying the former leader's presence could interfere with the efforts to stabilize the country by inspiring his loyalists in Haiti to resist the transition to a new government.

SECTION: Section D; Column 1; Sports Desk; Pg. 7; COLLEGE HOCKEY REPORT

LENGTH: 839 words

HEADLINE: Pleasing Time for N.C.A.A.

BYLINE: By MARK SCHEERER

 BODY:
Despite the discontinuation of hockey as a varsity sport by three Division I programs over the past two seasons, Tom Jacobs, the N.C.A.A.'s director of championships, said this week that the state of college hockey had ''never been better.'' 
 In a conference call with the news media in advance of Sunday's selection of the 16 teams for this year's N.C.A.A. tournament, Jacobs said: ''I think if you look at the quality of the competition, it's just unbelievable. It's just a terrific product.'' 
 The tournament, which expanded last year to 16 teams from 12, is one of a handful of championships that generate revenue for the National Collegiate Athletic Association, according to Jacobs. ''Typically it's right up there in the top three behind men's basketball and alongside baseball and some others.'' 
 Earlier this season, Findlay College downgraded hockey to a club sport, as did Fairfield and Iona last season. Robert Morris has been invited to take Findlay's place in College Hockey America.
 Ron Grahame, chairman of the Division I men's ice hockey committee, said, ''We've had a couple of schools that have made a determination that they are not going to sponsor the sport any longer, but that's probably a larger decision over all, economically, for an institution versus the game itself.'' 
 Asked to compare the state of the college game to that of the National Hockey League, currently reeling from the attack by Todd Bertuzzi of the Vancouver Canucks on Steve Moore of the Colorado Avalanche, Grahame said, ''We do a good job policing the game or managing the game from an N.C.A.A. and a collegiate perspective, so that some of the issues that are dealt with on the professional level don't come into our game because it's just not tolerated.''

COLLEGE HOCKEY AMERICA
Niagara Is First to Earn Berth
 The first team to earn a berth in the N.C.A.A. tournament was Niagara, seeded second in the College Hockey America tournament, which upset Bemidji State in the championship game last Sunday. The Purple Eagles (21-14-3) needed an overtime goal by Joe Tallari to win an automatic bid. Tallari, a finalist for the Hobey Baker Award last year, was assisted by Barret Ehgoetz, the third-leading scorer in Division I with 51 points. Bemidji State, C.H.A.'s regular-season champion, is not expected to receive an N.C.A.A. bid.

HOCKEY EAST
Boston University Is Rallying
 Boston University could salvage a dismal season by securing the N.C.A.A. berth that goes to the winner of the Hockey East tournament. The Terriers (12-16-9) surprised Boston College in the two-of-three-game first round. Next, they face second-ranked Maine in a single-elimination semifinal Friday. If Boston University upsets Maine, it will play the winner of the New Hampshire-Massachusetts semifinal. Boston College, ranked No. 1 in the nation two weeks ago, has lost five of its last six games.

DIVISION III
Two Semifinal Teams Score Nine
 Norwich University will play host to the final three games of the N.C.A.A. tournament on Friday and Saturday. Norwich and Middlebury will meet in one semifinal, both having won their quarterfinals with nine-goal broadsides. The defending champion, Norwich (24-3-0), defeated Hobart, 9-5, and Middlebury (25-3-0) stopped Wentworth, 9-1. 
 St. Norbert and Plattsburgh will play in the other semifinal. Plattsburgh (23-4-3) defeated Curry on a goal by Paul Kelly 18 minutes 9 seconds into overtime. It was Kelly's third goal of the game. In a rematch of the Northern Collegiate Hockey Association final, St. Norbert (26-2-2) beat Wisconsin-River Falls, 3-0.

WOMEN
Elmira's Division III Title Run Ends
 There will be a new Division III women's champion this year. The past two years, Elmira has beaten Manhattanville in the final. Last Friday, Elmira was eliminated by Middlebury (22-4-0), which advanced to face Plattsburgh (21-5-2) in a semifinal Friday. Top-seeded and top-ranked Manhattanville (23-2-2) will face Wisconsin-Stevens Point in the other semifinal. In a game that went into a second overtime period, Wisconsin-Stevens Point (18-6-4) defeated Gustavus Adolphus, 3-2. 
 *Minnesota took the Western Collegiate Hockey Association title, defeating Minnesota-Duluth, 4-2. The Gophers (28-4-2) will be seeded No. 1 when the N.C.A.A. announces the pairings for the Frozen Four in Providence, R.I., on March 26-28.
 *Two W.C.H.A. teams, Wisconsin and Minnesota-Duluth, are hoping for one of the four N.C.A.A. bids. Shannon Miller, coach of the three-time defending champion Minnesota-Duluth, said her Bulldogs deserved a berth because of their tough schedule and their record against top teams.

HEADLINE: Rumble at the Sierra Club

 BODY:
The Sierra Club, which spends its energy battling others on environmental issues, is now caught up in a nasty debate of its own. The issue is immigration, the battleground this year's election of new directors. 
On one side are dissidents who would have the club promote more restrictive federal immigration policies. A majority of the organization's current board members and its senior management rightly feel that the club must remain neutral on an emotional issue they regard as largely irrelevant.
 Anti-immigration groups have long sought to make their exclusionist agenda more palatable by framing it as an environmental issue. So immigrants are blamed for everything from urban sprawl to dirty air and traffic congestion. The premise underlying these claims is that the nation's growing population is reaching unsustainable levels. The premise is faulty. Sprawl, for example, has less to do with population growth than it has with misguided policies on zoning, transportation patterns and open space. Likewise, reducing air pollution rests far more on timely regulation and new technologies than on controlling population.
 Adding such a toxic issue as immigration to the Sierra Club's agenda would simply divert the organization from its primary responsibility, which is to keep real environmental problems in the public consciousness. The club went through a similar struggle in 1998. Since then, the idea that environmental problems cannot be solved until the country gets a grip on what some regard as unsustainable population growth has been further discredited. 
 The economic reality is that immigrants want jobs, and that the United States and other industrialized nations need workers. Thus the real task for environmentalists is to help policy makers manage the inevitable in ways that protect both people and the environment.

 BODY:

THE COMING OF THE THIRD REICH
By Richard J. Evans
Illustrated. 622 pages. Penguin Press. $34.95.
 How did it happen? Looking back over the wreckage of the last century, not all its horrors are simply inexplicable. Wars killed scores of millions, but then war is as old as original sin, and although Stalin murdered many more millions, it's true (if no excuse) that czarist Russia had been a primitive peasant society.
 But Germany was not backward. As the 20th century began, it seemed -- and in many ways really was -- the most advanced of all nations, with a dazzling cultural heritage and a formidable industrial economy. The Reich created by Otto von Bismarck in 1871 appeared to have a rule of law as well as a democratic parliament.
 By 1918 Germany had begun one war and lost it; by 1933 Hitler had come to power; by 1945, having devastated Europe and carried out unimagined acts of wickedness, Germany was mired in utter moral as well as physical desolation. How could it have happened?
 This is the question Richard J. Evans addresses in ''The Coming of the Third Reich,'' the first part of a planned three-volume history of the National Socialist regime. A professor at Cambridge University, Mr. Evans is, with Michael Burleigh and Sir Ian Kershaw, one of the British historians who have become eminent narrators of this terrible story, and he enjoyed a wider fame as an expert, and devastating, witness in a libel action when the historian David Irving sued an American scholar who had accused him of Holocaust denial.
 Rather than delving into mistier origins, Mr. Evans starts by showing that the Bismarckian Reich's semblance of representative government was largely illusory. Even so, he insists that Hitler's rise had not ''been pre-programmed by the previous course of German history,'' and was in no sense inevitable.
 Defeat in the Great War was made worse when so many Germans failed to recognize that they had in fact lost: Friedrich Ebert, the Social Democrat leader, told the returning army in 1918, ''No enemy has overcome you!'' Although the new Weimar Republic survived the crazy inflation of 1923 (from January, when there were 17,000 marks to a dollar, to December, when it was notionally 4,200 billion), many Germans never accepted the republic's legitimacy.
 Prominent among those who rejected it were the parties of the radical right. One such, still very small in the early 1920's, was the German Workers' Party, whose leader had picked up a ragbag of noxious notions abroad at the time: war as ''biological necessity,'' ferocious anti-Semitism and an obsession with ''racial hygiene'' and the ''unfit.'' All these were seeds that would bear hideous fruit.
 Even then, with all of Hitler's hypnotic demagoguery, the Nazis could still win no more than 2.6 percent of the vote in the May 1928 election. It took the Depression to knock the republic flat. As unemployment quadrupled, political violence spiraled out of control -- 105 people were killed in Prussia during the election months of June and July 1932 -- while the Communists did everything they could to undermine democracy.
 Finally came the grotesque miscalculation of the conservative politicians who brought Hitler to power in January 1933 thinking that they had hired him in order to discredit him. No hindsight was needed to see the stupidity of this: the French ambassador to Berlin, Andre Francois-Poncet, dryly said at the time that those politicians thought they were clever, ''ridding themselves of the wolf by introducing him into the sheepfold.'' 
 Although Mr. Evans has read very widely, he sometimes relies too much on particular sources, like the diaries (remarkable as they are) of Victor Klemperer. Writing in a self-confident tone, Mr. Evans has a few quirks, like translating every turn of phrase, even those in common currency.
 There may be something to be said for rendering Fuhrer as ''leader,'' but the baffling ''struggle for culture'' turns out to refer not to some worthy artistic aspirations but to what is well-known in English as well as German as the Kulturkampf, Bismarck's campaign against the Roman Catholic Church. And to translate the names of newspapers -- Frankfurt News for Frankfurter Zeitung, Berlin Daily News-Sheet for Berliner Tageblatt, Racial Observer for Volkischer Beobachter -- is just silly. At one point Mr. Evans cites a contemporary article from this newspaper. A German historian might well do the same, but he would call it The New York Times, not Die Neuyorker Zeiten.
 ''Is it wrong to begin with Bismarck?'' Mr. Evans asks, and by the end of his story it looks all too right. There is a lingering fashion to admire Bismarck for his political genius and his comparative restraint, and of course he would have despised Hitler. And yet Bismarck does bear a heavy burden for having taught Germany the use of war as a cynical instrument of policy.
 By waging his domestic wars against socialism and the Catholic Church (to which two of five citizens in his Reich belonged), he alienated the industrial working class and their Social Democratic party from the state, while preventing the emergence of a constitutional conservative party that could have embraced Protestants and Catholics. As it was, the Catholic Center party was born in narrow sectarianism and died betraying democracy and indeed Christendom into Hitler's hands, while cruelty and bloody persecution swept Germany.
 Recently there have been a number of books by Germans recalling the sufferings of the German people at the end of Hitler's reign. This book may act as something of an antidote by reminding us how his reign began.

HEADLINE: Missiles Incoming, and You're President

BYLINE: By JAMES GLANZ

DATELINE: COLORADO SPRINGS, March 16 

 BODY:
Call me Potus, baby.
 Half a dozen nuclear warheads are soaring from an East Asian country toward American cities on the computer screen in front of me, and it looks as if we are about to run short of interceptors in the missile defense system that is supposed to stop them. I have been chosen to play the role of president of the United States in this most frightening of war games. And now I must choose. 
 Should I save Boise or Anchorage? We may not have enough interceptors for both.
 My scalp tingles. The graphics are very convincing, and I know that they are based on real calculations of missile and interceptor trajectories. Being president is tough.
 This is the first time anyone outside the United States military and its contractors has seen the computer-based war game that the Pentagon is using to determine how a national missile defense might perform in a nuclear attack. Called M.D.-WAR for Missile Defense Wargame and Analysis Resource, it is the tool being used to train military and civilian personnel who, led by the president, would actually make life-or-death decisions.
 Because only one new intercept test using parts of the actual system is scheduled before initial deployment this year, the Pentagon is relying heavily on simulations like these. But the simulations and the system itself have been criticized by outside weapons experts and Democratic lawmakers.
 ''Garbage in, garbage out,'' said Joseph Cirincione, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, who maintains that the simulations will not be meaningful without more data from a variety of tests. ''You can play that game all week, and you would have no idea on what would happen in an actual missile attack.'' 
 Officials at the Pentagon's Missile Defense Agency, though, say their tests have yielded enough data to create realistic exercises on the computer. And Rick Lehner, a spokesman for the agency, said the threats considered in this simulation -- incoming missiles that do not break into multiple warheads, for example -- are expected of ''rogue states'' like North Korea.
 In a carefully managed event intended to give a taste of how the system works -- and doubtless also to build public support -- the Pentagon invited seven reporters to play the roles of critical decision makers, from tactical leaders up to commander in chief. Why I have been chosen president I do not know, but the most vain part of my mind believes it has to do with the new charcoal-colored cashmere jacket I have worn here to the Joint National Integration Center at Schriever Air Force Base. Cashmere looks presidential. Heads of state have been chosen for flimsier reasons.
 Potus, baby.
 The launchings come from a mythical country on an island in the Sea of Japan called Midland, which is not (wink, wink) North Korea.
 I am having a typical day at the White House, feet up in the Oval Office, pondering the big questions, when the first hint that something has gone badly wrong comes through in the Situation Room: ''We have an L.R.B.M. in boost phase on Midland.''
 That means a long-range ballistic missile is firing its boosters. The feet come down. I go to the Situation Room, wearing the cashmere jacket.
 Now some really bad news comes in over my audio link. ''Confirm, early warning on unscheduled launch from Midland. Impact point, Portland, Ore. Time to impact, approximately 26 minutes.''
 There are five more launchings. Two missiles are knocked out by a ''boost phase'' interceptor -- a laser that does not actually exist yet but that in the simulation is flying on an airplane near Midland. Boise, Anchorage and Helena are targets.
 An adviser speaks to me over my shoulder, suggesting I contact United States Northern Command, or Northcom. ''Push the button down,'' the adviser says to me, pointing to my comm link.
 ''Do I have to identify myself?'' I ask.
 ''Yeah, I would say, 'White House.' ''
 ''Northcom,'' I say, ''this is White House. We understand that U.S. is under attack.''
 ''Yes,'' Northcom replies, ''that is our assessment, White House. North America is under attack.''
 ''So now we found a war,'' my adviser says.
 ''Ho! God!'' Potus hisses.
 Things go promisingly for a while. The missile aimed at Portland is destroyed by an interceptor. But Midland launches fighter planes against the laser, and it has to retreat. And the missile aimed for Boise slips past an interceptor. Since the United States has only six interceptors in the simulation -- an implicit message of the exercise seems to be, buy as many interceptors as possible -- that leaves three incoming missiles and four interceptors.
 I scramble for ways to choose among the cities if I have to. I was recently in Montana -- losing Helena is out. So it could be between Anchorage and Boise. Alphabetical order? By population? Contribution to gross domestic product?
 Potus squirms in indecision, but, just as in Hollywood, the missile defense system comes through. There are three straight hits, and so the United States is saved, with one interceptor to spare.
 There is only one thing I am sure of. My counterpart in Midland is about to have a bad day, too.

HEADLINE: BUSH'S CAMPAIGN EMPHASIZES ROLE OF LEADER IN WAR

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON and ADAM NAGOURNEY; Jodi Wilgoren contributed reporting from Huntington, W.Va., for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 16 

 BODY:
A year after ordering the invasion of Iraq, President Bush is moving the war to the forefront of his re-election effort with a weeklong barrage of speeches, an orchestrated set of interviews with senior Pentagon officials and a new television advertisement questioning Senator John Kerry's support of the troops.
 Mr. Bush's advisers said Tuesday that the president intended to press his case that the world was safer with Saddam Hussein out of power, and to use the first anniversary, on Friday, of the war's start to draw sharp contrasts with Mr. Kerry over foreign policy and leadership. 
 The moves were part of what aides described as a new chapter in the political campaign against Mr. Kerry. But they came as the bombings in Spain stirred more criticism of Mr. Bush's Iraq policy, underlining the extent to which the campaign had become subject to the unpredictability of overseas events, and pointing up the complications Mr. Bush faces in trying to balance the demands of the presidency with a re-election effort. 
 In the Oval Office on Tuesday, Mr. Bush showed a flash of how confrontational he planned to be on Mr. Kerry's foreign affairs record. With the Dutch prime minister, Jan Peter Balkenende, at his side, Mr. Bush demanded that Mr. Kerry provide evidence to support his suggestion last week that foreign leaders want to see Mr. Bush defeated. 
 ''If you're going to make an accusation in the course of a presidential campaign, you've got to back it up with facts,'' Mr. Bush told reporters on Tuesday.
 Mr. Bush then was asked if he and Mr. Balkenende had agreed on whether Dutch troops would remain in Iraq. Neither gave a firm answer.
 At a campaign appearance in West Virginia, Mr. Kerry shot back at Mr. Bush, caustically challenging his credibility on an array of fronts.
 ''Nothing is more important than telling the American people the truth about the economy, health care, and war and peace,'' Mr. Kerry told veterans on Tuesday, the day he won the Illinois primary. ''This administration has yet to level with the American people.''
 The White House had long planned to use this week to focus attention on the war, terrorism and national security. The White House is counting on those issues to build support for the president at a time when the other big subject of the campaign, the lack of jobs being created by the economy, is working against Mr. Bush.
 On Thursday, Mr. Bush will travel to Fort Campbell, Ky., for a speech before what the White House said would be 20,000 troops and their families. He plans to thank them for their sacrifices in Iraq and Afghanistan and to point to the progress being made in both nations.
 Mr. Bush is also expected to highlight his role as commander in chief when he delivers an address to his first full-scale campaign rally of the year, in Orlando, Fla., on Saturday.
 At the same time, the administration is going after Mr. Kerry. Vice President Dick Cheney will begin a new attack on Mr. Kerry in California on Wednesday.
 ''The American people will have a clear choice in the election of 2004 -- at least as clear as any since the election of 1984,'' Mr. Cheney is expected to say, in a reference to the race between Ronald Reagan and Walter F. Mondale, according to an advance excerpt of his speech.
 The new Bush television commercial, which began running in the swing state of West Virginia on Tuesday, sought to discredit Mr. Kerry's defense credentials by attacking him for voting against the $87 billion bill last year that financed operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.
 Mr. Kerry had voted for the resolution authorizing war in Iraq, but White House aides said he later expressed enough ambivalence about the war to let them portray him as opposing a war that enjoys wide support among Americans.
 Mr. Kerry dismissed the advertisement. ''I understand that the Republican attack machine has welcomed me to West Virginia today with another distortion and misleading statement,'' he said.
 ''I'm not going to worry about them misleading because we're going to just keep pounding away at the truth,'' Mr. Kerry told the crowd of veterans, who wore a rainbow of caps, jackets and pins representing all the military branches and recent conflicts. ''We're going to build an army of truth-tellers.''
 Mr. Kerry added, ''I actually did vote for the $87 billion before I voted against it,'' referring to an amendment he supported that would have rescinded some tax cuts to finance the war.
 Mr. Kerry did not respond to Mr. Bush's call that he explain his suggestion about other leaders rooting for his victory. Although on Monday, it emerged that the suggestion was misquoted and that Mr. Kerry had said ''more'' leaders, not ''foreign'' leaders, the comments came in response to remarks about travel abroad and the White House continued to press the issue. Asked about it, a Kerry aide, David Wade, said: ''President Bush is launching political attacks from the White House because he can't defend what he's done in the White House.''
 Mr. Kerry's advisers asserted that Mr. Bush's focus on Iraq reflected White House concern that the conduct of the war had been a failure. The advisers said Mr. Kerry welcomed a fight on the issue.
 White House officials argued that the events in Spain would not undercut public support of the war.
 Mr. Kerry, speaking for the first time about the Spanish election, told the ABC network affiliate in Phoenix on Tuesday:: ''In my judgment, the new prime minister should not have decided that he was going to pull out of Iraq. He should have said this, This increases our determination to get the job done.''
 A senior White House adviser who would only discuss the details of Mr. Bush's campaign planning on condition of anonymity noted that polls showed strong public support for the war and asserted that Mr. Kerry was making a mistake criticizing the conduct of the war.
 The adviser said: ''You ask them this: 'The Bush campaign is absolutely willing to have this conversation carried on for the next 216 days. Are you?' It should be one of the big discussions between us.''
 Other Bush aides said they were not altering their plans to blanket the nation with a message that Mr. Bush was a tested leader while Mr. Kerry could not be counted on.
 ''The American people have etched in their minds the president's leadership in a time of crisis,'' said Dan Bartlett, the White House communications director. ''That's something voters find comfort in going into an election. Whether it has to be emphasized or not, we've made clear that one of the most important issues is how the two candidates would conduct the war on terror and protect America. There's a clear choice.''
 By asserting that the war in Iraq is an integral part of the battle against terrorism -- an assertion that many critics dispute -- the White House has to some extent bet Mr. Bush's political standing as the nation's post-Sept. 11 leader on the effort to stabilize Iraq.
 But in making the case that toppling Mr. Hussein was a vital step in protecting the United States from terrorism, the White House is also setting out a broad strategic framework built on the idea that bringing peace and democracy to Iraq and the Middle East would generally undercut the forces that have bred Islamic militancy.
 Mr. Bartlett said Mr. Bush would discuss that theme on Friday in a speech at the White House. The speech will be delivered to an audience of ambassadors from nearly all the nations that have lent some support to the fight against terrorism and is intended to rally support for the job of stabilizing Iraq and the entire Middle East, he said.
 Mr. Bush's appearances this week are part of a coordinated, administrationwide effort to tell voters that the United States is making progress in fighting terrorism and that Mr. Bush deserves the credit.
 The Pentagon threw open its doors to local radio talk show hosts on Tuesday and made available to them Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz, generals and other military and civilian officials. 
 Mr. Kerry does not plan to let foreign policy and military issues drop from sight, either. On Wednesday in Washington, he plans to give a speech on national security and to propose a ''Military Families Bill of Rights.''

HEADLINE: Powell Reassures India on Technology Jobs but Presses for Opening of Markets

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, March 16 

 BODY:
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, encountering the other side of a tempestuous debate in the United States, sought to assure Indians on Tuesday that the Bush administration would not try to halt the outsourcing of high-technology jobs to their country.
 In discussions with Indian leaders and college students, Mr. Powell found that the issue of the transfer of American jobs to India by leading technology companies was as emotional in India as in the United States. 
 But whereas American politicians have deplored the loss of such jobs, it was clear that the anxiety in India focuses on threats by some members of Congress to try to stop the transfer by legislation. 
 Responding to a questioner in a session with students who asked if he supported or opposed outsourcing, Mr. Powell said: ''Outsourcing is a natural effect of the global economic system and the rise of the Internet and broadband communications. You're not going to eliminate outsourcing; but, at the same time, when you outsource jobs it becomes a political issue in anybody's country.'' 
 Mr. Powell told the students what he had said to reporters earlier in the day after a meeting with Foreign Minister Yaswant Sinha: an appropriate American response to outsourcing was to press India to open up to imports of American investments, goods and services. 
 He said one purpose of his trip was to explain to India that because outsourcing had created a political problem in the United States, India could help by lowering its trade barriers. He said he was making that request, not as a condition for the United States allowing outsourcing to continue, but because it was in India's interest to be more open. 
 In February, Gregory Mankiw, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, stirred a political outcry when he called the outsourcing of jobs a long-term ''plus'' for the economy. While Mr. Powell said Tuesday that ''it is the reality of 21st century economics that these kinds of dislocations will take place,'' he was quick to add that the Bush administration would work to train people for new jobs.
 In Washington, the White House endorsed Mr. Powell's comments.
 ''The secretary made clear in his remarks that we are concerned when Americans lose jobs, and we are focused on creating jobs for American workers, and the best way to do that is to open markets around the world, including in India,'' said Claire Buchan, a spokeswoman for the White House.
 But David Wade, a spokesman for Senator John Kerry, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said Mr. Powell's comments demonstrated how the Bush administration has ''failed to fight for American workers.'' 
 The questions put to Mr. Powell on Tuesday showed the high degree of interest in American affairs by his Indian audience. 
 Mr. Powell had a full day of activities, meeting with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and other Indian leaders and then attending a dinner at the residence of the United States ambassador. 
 He has repeatedly joined with Indian leaders to proclaim that the current period is seeing their countries' closest friendship in many years. 
 Two years ago, Mr. Powell visited at a time of rising tensions with Pakistan. Now, despite the American embrace of the Pakistani president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, Indian leaders have not voiced loud objections to such American policies as overlooking Pakistan's past proliferation of nuclear technology. 
 Suspicions of Pakistan are never far below the surface in India, however, and Mr. Powell was repeatedly asked by reporters and students why the United States was being lenient with Pakistan despite its detrimental activities. ''Pakistan is a friend of the United States, just as India is a friend of the United States,'' Mr. Powell told the students. He said, however, that Pakistan's allowing nuclear materials and knowledge to leak to other countries was ''reprehensible,'' and that he would take up this matter with General Musharraf later this week.
 Financial issues dominated the talks, American and Indian officials said. The United States has intensified its drive to open Indian markets and wants to sell advanced civilian space and nuclear technology, but only if India imposes controls so that the technology is not passed on to other countries. 
 Responding to questions, Mr. Powell defended the war in Iraq and American foreign policy generally, especially against suggestions that the United States used force in its own interests whenever it wanted. 
 ''We don't go around invading everybody,'' he told the students. ''Iraq was an entirely different subject.'' Later he added: ''Not every answer is use of military force -- quite the contrary with respect to the U.S. policy.''

HEADLINE: The Cost of Cheap Money

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve Board announced yesterday that it would keep its overnight interest rate where it has been for nine months -- at 1 percent, its lowest level since 1958. Factor in inflation, and Alan Greenspan is essentially lending money at a loss. This cannot go on indefinitely, and it should not go on much longer. In this election year, Mr. Greenspan and the other Fed officials are under tremendous pressure to stay put on rates in the absence of a tightening labor market or other signs of inflation, but such a stance would be a mistake. There are other costs associated with exceptionally cheap money that the Fed must recognize, and address by gradually raising rates. 
 There is no question that the Fed's loose monetary policy helped jolt the economy back to life last year. It increased corporate profits and prompted consumers to refinance their mortgages and to spend their way into plenty of other debt. That mission accomplished, the argument for keeping rates at crisis-driven shock-therapy lows is that businesses are still not hiring, and that there is no sign of inflation on the horizon. Those are the classic cues the Fed awaits before raising rates.
 The sharp spike in the productivity growth rate in recent years explains why mass hirings and signs of inflation are scarce even with a rebounding economy. But the Fed cannot afford complacency.
 Mr. Greenspan should heed the lessons of the stock market bubble of the late 1990's. In the new economy, remember, we were assured that the old speed limits needn't apply. What investors were not warned about enough was the extent to which the virtuous cycle of cheap money, low inflation and strong growth was feeding a speculative financial market bubble, which eventually popped at huge cost to those investors.
 Now there are other hints that too much of a good thing can be dangerous. In some parts of the nation, housing values suggest that another bubble is forming. Many homeowners, and consumers in general, are borrowing recklessly, betting that rising housing prices and easy credit are here to stay. With 30-year loans available at 5.5 percent, mortgage debt soared to $6.8 trillion last year, from $4.9 trillion in 2000. The nation may be in for a rude shock when the real estate market levels off, and when millions discover that the adjustable rates of their mortgages and other loans can be adjusted upward.
 The Fed should gradually wean the country off such extraordinarily easy money before it is forced to do so abruptly, and painfully. It cannot wait until after the election, nor until it sees inflation pick up. Rates are so low that the Fed has plenty of room to move before being accused of adopting a restrictive monetary policy. It needs to get started.

HEADLINE: Spain Grapples With Notion That Terrorism Trumped Democracy

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ and ELAINE SCIOLINO; Helene Fouquet and Dale Fuchs contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: MADRID, March 16 

 BODY:
In the aftermath of its national election, Spain, along with the rest of the world, is struggling to answer a harrowing question: who really won on Sunday, the Socialists or the terrorists?
 For the departing foreign minister, Ana Palacio, whose center-right government staunchly supported the American-led war in Iraq and lost the election, the answer is clear. ''We are giving birth to a new world, and it is sad and dangerous and sick,'' Mrs. Palacio said in an interview. ''We are giving a signal to terrorists that they can have their way because we have given in.''
 For Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, the Socialist who will soon become the next prime minister, the answer is far different. Asked at a news conference on Monday whether terrorist bombs had catapulted him to power, Mr. Zapatero said nothing could be further from the truth. 
 ''Spaniards have always expressed great maturity and common sense at the time of voting,'' he said, emphasizing each word. ''There was a desire for change because there was a government that had done bad things. And on Sunday, the people voted for change.''
 The reverberations from the ballot box here have been felt around the world. Spain, with Britain, had embraced the American war effort in Iraq, despite widespread popular opposition. The Madrid bombings raised the possibility that Europe was a fresh target for violence and that terrorists could undermine democracy and manipulate elections.
 In Washington, President Bush tried to dispel the notion that the Spanish election would lead other European nations to seek distance from Washington's approach to terrorism and Iraq. During a meeting with the Dutch prime minister, Jan Peter Balkenende, Mr. Bush asked the Dutch people -- and by extension other Europeans -- to think hard before they followed any impulse to pull their troops out of Iraq.
 ''I would ask them to think about the Iraqi citizens, who don't want people to withdraw, because they want to be free,'' Mr. Bush said. ''And I would remind the Dutch citizens that Al Qaeda has an interest in Iraq for a reason.'' He added, ''They realize this is a front in the war on terror, and they fear the spread of freedom and democracy in places like the greater Middle East.''
 The contest in Spain had always been close between the governing Popular Party, which backed Mr. Bush's policies, and the Socialists, who opposed them. Other issues at stake before the bombings were unemployment, a housing shortage, women's rights and social benefits.
 In March 2003, at the height of opposition to the Iraq war, the Socialists were ahead in polls. With the economy roaring and the Socialist Party in disarray, the Popular Party pulled ahead. On March 7, the last date in which polls were published, an Opina poll showed that the gap had narrowed, giving the Popular Party 42 percent, compared with 38 percent for the Socialists.
 Four days later, terror struck. With Madrid under siege, voters were expected to rally around the flag and stick with the party that had talked the toughest against terrorism, at least initially. Even the Socialists braced themselves for that outcome, said two senior party officials.
 But interviews with scores of Spaniards of both parties indicated that a number of things happened after the attacks that shifted the balance to the Socialists. Voters flooded the polls on Sunday in record numbers, especially young people who had not planned to vote. In interviews, they said they did so not so much out of fear of terror as out of anger against a government they saw as increasingly authoritarian, arrogant and stubborn. The government, they said, mishandled the crisis in the emotional days after the attacks.
 Voters said they were enraged not only by the government's insistence that the Basque separatist group ETA was responsible, despite mounting evidence to the contrary, but they also resented its clumsy attempts to quell antigovernment sentiment.
 For example, the main television channel TVE, which is state-owned, showed scant and selective scenes of antigovernment demonstrations on Saturday night, just as it ran very little coverage of the large demonstrations against the war in Iraq last year. It also suddenly changed its regular programming to air a documentary on the horrors of ETA.
 That was the last straw for some Spaniards, who said it evoked the nightmare of censorship during the Franco dictatorship little more than a quarter of a century ago.
 Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar personally called the top editors of Spain's major dailies twice on the day of the attacks. In the first round of calls, Mr. Aznar said he was convinced that ETA was responsible.
 ''He said, 'It was ETA, Antonio, don't doubt it in the least,' '' said Antonio Franco, editor in chief of the Barcelona-based El Periodico de Catalunya, in an interview.
 Mr. Franco's newspaper published a special edition based on Mr. Aznar's call, then Mr. Franco published an editorial rectifying the mistake as new information came to light. ''It was shameful to me that the whole world was taking precautions and debating about Al Qaeda except in Spain, where the attack occurred,'' he said.
 At the Spanish news agency EFE, Alfonso Bauluz, a correspondent and member of the agency's union, said, ''I received information from my colleagues, who have good sources, about the Al Qaeda hypothesis, but the editor said we don't want that, don't pay attention. On Saturday, the editor wrote a story with his own byline saying all possibilities of an Al Qaeda connection were thrown out.''
 During Mr. Aznar's second call that evening, he acknowledged that other avenues were being investigated, but discounted them, Mr. Franco said.
 Meanwhile, within 24 hours of the terrorist attacks, the Socialists, through their own intelligence and diplomatic contacts in the Muslim world, were already leaning toward the theory that Al Qaeda and not ETA was responsible, two senior Socialist Party officials said.
 Spaniards are still struggling to absorb both the shock of the terror attacks and interpret the result of the upset election on Sunday.
 ''The terrorism attack has changed the result of the election, but the people were also deceived by the government, so it's a combination, a mix of the two of things,'' said Elena Roldan, a 28-year-old law librarian who voted Socialist.
 Asked whether she felt the United States bore some responsibility for encouraging Spain to join its war against Iraq, she replied, ''Nobody forced Aznar to go to war; the entire country was against it. Nobody has been saying that the United States was responsible for this attack, but everybody holds the Spanish government responsible.''
 At the bus and train terminal at Plaza de la Castilla in northern Madrid, Alberto Martin, a 31-year-old nuclear physicist who voted Socialist, said, ''If the government had said, 'We don't know who did it,' nothing would have happened and Zapatero would not be there. Aznar was making decisions without any consideration for people's concerns. Look at the war in Iraq. Aznar thought he was God! There was no dialogue.''
 The election, Mr. Martin added, ''is a victory for the people, not for terrorism. You see, I'm now going to take the train.''

HEADLINE: Europe And U.S. Near Accord On Auditing

BYLINE: By PAUL MELLER; Floyd Norris, in Paris, contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, March 16 

 BODY:
The European Commission signaled on Tuesday that it might settle a longstanding dispute with the United States next week that would pave the way for joint supervision of the auditing profession.
 ''We have come to a compromise'' with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, an independent body created after the Enron scandal, Frits Bolkestein, the European Union's internal market commissioner, said after a meeting at the European Parliament.
 ''This will mean we will supervise in a joint effort the whole auditing profession,'' he added.
 The chairman of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, William J. McDonough, is scheduled to visit Brussels next week, ''at which time I hope I will be able to hammer out the final details,'' Mr. Bolkestein said. 
 Part of the problem the sides hope to resolve is the information that United States authorities would try to seize during an investigation. The commission wants the American authorities to agree to involve European audit regulators in any such inquiry.
 In Washington, the European Commission action was applauded by Mr. McDonough. ''The directive offered today by the European Commission is a highly constructive step toward our mutual goal of protecting investors,'' he said.
 ''The system of accounting oversight described in the directive will mesh quite well with the accounting oversight we are putting in place here in the United States. I applaud the work of my friend Frits Bolkestein and his staff,'' Mr. McDonough added.
 Christi Harlan, a spokeswoman for the oversight board, said the American body insisted on the registration of foreign audit firms, and said a number had already registered.
 ''What we are discussing with the E.C. representatives are the circumstances of inspections and investigations,'' she said.
 She said the board was willing to accept the work of European regulators in inspecting and investigating auditing firms based in Europe, so long as it was clear the regulators were both independent and vigorous.
 News of a possible compromise came after Mr. Bolkestein proposed earlier in the day a unionwide law on corporate auditing that calls for similar standards to those being imposed in the United States. 
 ''No one is naive enough to think any directive will stop accounting fraud at a stroke -- you cannot abolish crime,'' Mr. Bolkestein said. ''But what we are proposing would inject more rigor and a stronger dose of ethics into the audit process, bolstering that defense on which all market economies rely.''
 The collapse of the Italian dairy giant Parmalat just three months ago ''was a reminder of what happens when that defense fails,'' he added.
 Like its American counterpart, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which was passed in 2002 largely in response to the Enron scandal, the European directive aims to tighten the regulation of the auditing profession to deter future corporate misdeeds.
 Companies will be required to appoint audit committees that act independently of management. These committees would appoint the audit firm, and to prevent the relationship's becoming too cozy, companies would have to rotate their chief auditor once every five years if it has more than one firm working for it, or once every seven years if there is only one auditor, the commission said in a statement.
 The directive would pave the way for the creation of a network of national public accounting oversight boards in each country in the European Union. At present, most countries allow the accounting profession to regulate itself.
 The national regulators would keep a register of all auditors, whether European or from elsewhere, practicing in their country. The commission initially fought to exempt European auditors active in the United States from registering with the American regulator, the oversight board, arguing that similar supervision in Europe would make additional supervision in the United States unnecessary.
 With this directive, the commission is effectively imposing the same conditions on American auditors practicing in Europe.
 The directive is expected to form the basis for cooperation agreements with auditing authorities from other parts of the world, the commission said, including the oversight board.
 The unionwide law would call for national regulators to impose criminal sanctions for serious offenses, the commission said.
 The financial meltdown of one of Europe's biggest food companies, and a similar crisis at the Dutch retailer Royal Ahold had a direct influence on the shape of the proposal, Jonathan Todd, a spokesman for the internal market commission, said. ''The requirement for companies to have an independent audit committee was added after the Parmalat affair,'' he said.
 But momentum to reform the law in Europe began long before Parmalat, Mr. Todd said. Efforts began after the Enron scandal in 2001, more or less when the United States starting writing the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Quicker off the mark, the American law became the yardstick for Europe.

HEADLINE: Housing Starts Show a Decline

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Home builders broke ground at a slower-than-expected pace in February, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. Bad weather also played a part in the decline, and economists said housing could regain some momentum because of a recent decline in mortgage rates. 
 Starts on new housing fell 4 percent last month, to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.855 million compared with January, well below the 1.93 million Wall Street analysts projected. January housing starts were revised upward to a 1.932 million pace from 1.903 million.
 ''This is a huge disappointment relative to expectations,'' said Anthony Chan, chief economist at Banc One Investment Advisers. But he added: ''Fundamentals are still strong for the housing market. It should get a second wind from the drop in rates.'' 
 According to the mortgage finance company Freddie Mac, the average interest rate on 30-year fixed mortgages was 5.64 percent in February, the lowest since July 2003, and rates have fallen further this month.
 Housing permits, an indicator of builders' confidence, also dipped in February, down 1.5 percent, to a 1.903 million annual pace, a figure in line with Wall Street projections.
 Housing starts were up in the Northeast and Midwest but down in the larger markets of the South and West. Starts rose 25.3 percent in the Northeast, to a 188,000 pace, the fastest since February 1988. In the Midwest, they were up 7.1 percent, to a 349,000 pace. In the South, housing starts fell 10.6 percent, to an annual 839,000, and in the West, they were down 7.5 percent to a 479,000 pace.
 While February's data was weaker than expected, the overall level was up 13.1 percent compared with February 2003.

HEADLINE: Egypt and Israel Discuss Industrial Trade Zone

BYLINE: By ABEER ALLAM

DATELINE: CAIRO, March 16 

 BODY:
Nearly a decade after an agreement first allowed for joint industrial areas where Egyptian goods with Israeli content can gain tariff-free access to the United States, Egypt and Israel finally seem to be seriously considering the creation of so-called Qualifying Industrial Zones.
 The zones, if formed, are expected to attract millions of dollars in foreign investment and employ thousands of Egyptian workers.
 An delegation of officials from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Egyptian textile businessmen is in Israel this week; last week, an Israeli delegation met Egypt's prime minister, Atef Ebied, in Cairo. Those meetings followed a visit to Israel in December by a delegation of Ministry of Foreign Trade officials and local businessmen, according to an Egyptian official close to the negotiations who insisted on anonymity.
 Though the Israelis confirmed the talks, Egyptian delegation members and Ministry of Foreign Trade officials all rejected or ignored repeated requests for comment. 
 The skittishness reflects just how sensitive the issue is in Egypt. Dealing with Israel comes at a very high political price, and the public and the press, largely hostile to Israeli policies in the occupied territories, have lashed out at both the Egyptian government and businessmen said to have been part of the trade delegation to Israel.
 Reports of talks on the special zones, known as Q.I.Z.'s, first surfaced late last year after a meeting of President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom of Israel on the sidelines of a conference on Information Technology in Geneva. 
 At the meeting, the two discussed the prospects of creating such zones to manufacture and export textiles -- a meeting that Eli Shakad, the Israeli ambassador to Egypt, said was the fruit of quiet discussions by Egyptian and Israeli businessmen as long as six months ago.
 ''What is happening in the past couple of months is very encouraging,'' Mr. Shakad said in a recent interview. ''Egypt and Israel are working now on the fine details of a Q.I.Z. agreement.''
 ''The Egyptians,'' he added, ''understand it serves their national interests.''
 There would be a benefit for Israel, too. The Q.I.Z. legislation, a 1996 Clinton administration initiative, basically extends to peace partners of Israel the preferential access to the United States market that Israel gained under the 1985 American-Israeli free trade agreement. It aimed to reward peace efforts in the Middle East and to encourage Arabs and Israelis to create a base of businesses joined by common interests to spur further development. 
 Under the initiative, at least 11.7 percent of the value added to any goods produced in a qualifying zone must come from Israel.
 ''You have to import from Israel in order to qualify,'' said Fahd al-Fanek, an economist in Jordan, a country also included in the legislation. (The Palestinian Authority was the other entity included.) ''If you make bags, for example, the handles must come from Israel not because they are the best or cheapest, but because these are the rules.''
 For Israeli businessmen, labor in Egypt and Jordan is cheap, an average of $100 a month, compared with $700 a month in Israel.
 Jordan concluded a Q.I.Z. agreement with Israel in November 1997 and its first zone was established in Irbid in 1998. Now 10 such zones have been designated by the United States trade representative's office. 
 Exports to the United States have boomed, and the zones have attracted Israeli and other foreign investment, mainly from Southeast Asia. Though Jordan signed a free trade agreement with the United States in 2000 nearly all its exports there still come through the zones, where the country's modernized industries and higher-quality products are concentrated.
 Egypt, however, evaded closer economic ties with Israel as it sought a full free trade agreement with the United States. But during the World Economic Forum meeting in Amman in June, the United States trade representative, Robert B. Zoellick, harshly criticized Egyptian economic policies and ruled out such an agreement.
 So, with the Egyptian economy flagging, major Egyptian manufacturers, especially textile makers, began searching for another way to bolster exports and attract foreign investment.
 Central to the current negotiations between Israel and Egypt is the question of how much Israeli content must be in the goods produced in a qualifying zone to enable the goods to enter the United States duty free, according to the Israeli ambassador and the Egyptian official who insisted on not being identified.
 The authorizing legislation states that at least 35 percent of the goods exported must be of local content, with Israeli content totaling 11.7 percent of that.
 According to the Egyptian official, Cairo wants the Israeli minimum contribution lowered to 8 percent, a reduction granted to Jordan soon after it concluded its Q.I.Z. agreement in 1997, while Israel wants to increase its minimum contribution to 14 to 17 percent.
 The official added that some Israeli businessmen with investments in Jordan's zones are lobbying against an Egyptian Q.I.Z. deal for fear of competition. Egyptian businessmen have said their zones will include a broad variety of textile goods that would not necessarily compete with those produced in Jordan.
 Jordan's Q.I.Z. exports to the United States rose from less than $20 million in 1999 to more than $200 million in 2002, according to Ministry of Trade and Industry in Jordan. Last year, the exports reached $660 million, 95 percent of them from Q.I.Z.'s and the rest under the Jordanian-American free trade agreement.
 Some experts have questions about how many local jobs such zones create and how broadly the economic benefits actually spread. According to Mr. al-Fanek, ''If workers of the Q.I.Z. left their job today, unemployment would rise from 15 percent to 16.5 percent.''
 About 1.5 percent of Jordan's laborers work in Q.I.Z.'s, he said. ''Not bad,'' he added. ''It helps in solving the problem -- not a total solution.''
 Egypt has more skilled workers with long experience in the textile industry. Egyptian proponents of the industrial zones hope to increase exports to the United States beyond the $3.5 billion logged in the 11 months ended in November 2003. Exports, particularly of textiles and clothing, in which Egypt competes with places like China and Pakistan, are limited by American import quotas and tariffs. Customs on woven fabrics range from 20 percent to 33.6 percent. Egypt exported $336.4 million worth of clothing and textiles to the United States in 2003, about a third of its worldwide total.
 Still, the prospect of working with Israel is a tough sell.
 Though Egypt was the first Arab country to sign a peace agreement with Israel, relations have remained strained, with Egypt regularly reminding the Israelis that progress in normalization is tied closely with progress on relations with the Palestinians.
 The Palestinian uprising in 2000 and the strong Egyptian public opinion against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza only made things worse. With the upsurge in the Israeli military operation in the West Bank, Egypt announced a freeze of all bilateral relations and withdrew its ambassador.
 Trade volume between the nations dropped to $45.7 million in 2003 from almost $80 million in 2000. The names of companies doing business with Israel have been publicized in the news media there.
 Some experts say the solution to Egypt's trade problems is less a matter of modifying trade rules and more a matter of modifying Egyptian business practices. 
 Akram Bastawi, a specialist in international trade regulations who advises governments in the region, said that the problem was not the language of any trade agreement with the United States. ''Globally competitive production and a lack of international marketing prowess are the central problems,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Citing Low Hiring, Fed Leaves Rates Alone

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 16 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve left short-term interest rates unchanged at 1 percent on Tuesday, noting that ''hiring has lagged'' and suggesting that it had become more concerned about the weak job market.
 The decision to leave interest rates unchanged had been widely expected by analysts and investors, and it reinforced expectations that the Fed would refrain from raising rates until much later this year or perhaps next year.
 Treasury bonds rose in value and yields declined after the decision was announced. Stocks, which had traded higher before the announcement, initially gave up their gains before rebounding. [Page C9.] 
 Since the summer, the Federal Reserve has kept the federal funds rate, the rate on overnight loans between banks, at its lowest level in 46 years.
 Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has warned that interest rates are too low to be sustainable indefinitely. At its last meeting on Jan. 28, the Fed's policy committee retreated from an open-ended commitment to keep rates low for ''a considerable period.''
 But Federal Reserve officials had also made clear that they were worried and puzzled about the stubbornly high level of unemployment, and their statement on Tuesday reflected disappointment over the surprisingly poor employment report for February issued by the Labor Department. 
 The economy has lost 2.2 million jobs in three years, and job growth has remained anemic despite rapid growth in the overall economy since the summer. In February, 21,000 jobs were added, compared with about 125,000 that economists say is necessary just to keep up with increases in population. The unemployment rate remained at 5.6 percent. 
 The Fed's statement on Tuesday hinted at slightly more pessimism than last month about the job market. Its rate-setting panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, said the economy continued to expand ''at a solid pace.'' But it added, ''Although job losses have slowed, new hiring has lagged.''
 It reiterated that inflation was extremely low and that there was little pressure to tighten monetary policy through higher rates. And it repeated a view that the risks of inflation and deflation were ''almost equal,'' and noted that increases in consumer prices were ''muted and expected to remain low.'' 
 ''With inflation quite low and resource use slack, the committee believes it can be patient in removing its policy accommodation,'' it said. In using the word ''slack,'' the Fed panel was alluding to the relatively high number of unemployed workers and the large amounts of spare factory capacity.
 Chris Wolfe, an analyst at the J.P. Morgan Private Bank, said the Federal Reserve's statement offered little real news but reassured investors who were worried that rapid price increases in commodities -- including crude oil, steel scrap and rubber -- suggested steeper inflation in the near future.
 ''This ought to quell the notion that massive inflation might be ahead,'' Mr. Wolfe said. 
 William C. Dudley, chief United States economist at Goldman, Sachs, said the Fed's decision on Tuesday confirmed what Mr. Greenspan and other top officials had been signaling for some time: that there is no need to raise interest rates any time soon.
 ''The Fed is actually speaking very plainly, but people are so used to the Fed speaking very subtly that the markets aren't used to it,'' said Mr. Dudley, who has predicted that the Fed would not raise rates until some time in 2005.
 The response in the credit market on Tuesday reflected a dissonance between the Fed and bond investors over the prospects for a bump up in inflation. Mr. Greenspan and other officials noted that consumer prices, excluding food and energy, were climbing barely 1 percent a year. 
 Outside the Fed, some economists have become worried about rising commodity prices, which have traditionally been a precursor to rising consumer prices. Oil, for instance, reached another recent high in New York trading Tuesday, with the April contract up 4 cents, to $37.48. 
 Unless the Federal Reserve raises rates by June, which most analysts consider extremely unlikely, it may be reluctant to change policy until well after the presidential elections in November. The Fed has usually tried to avoid taking any action that might be seen as favoring one side or another.
 Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo & Company in Minneapolis, commented: ''This is a presidential election year and the Federal Reserve does not want to become a political football. Most likely, there won't be any need to raise the interest rate this year.''

HEADLINE: Justice Dept. Opens Inquiry Into Shell Oil

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATONand JEFF GERTH

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 16 

 BODY:
The Justice Department has opened an inquiry into whether executives at the Royal Dutch/Shell Group violated any laws by failing to disclose in a timely fashion a significant shortfall in proven reserves of oil and natural gas, a person involved in the inquiry said Tuesday.
 The company and its executives are already the focus of investigations by European regulators and officials from the Securities and Exchange Commission. But the Justice Department, unlike the commission, has the authority to bring criminal charges as well as civil ones. British and Dutch regulators are also examining the company. 
 The Justice Department inquiry, which was opened in recent days, is being conducted by prosecutors in the United States attorney's office in Manhattan, which often handles securities law inquiries involving large publicly traded companies. Shell, the world's third-largest publicly traded oil company, is controlled by Dutch and British executives. It has publicly traded shares on major exchanges around the world, including the New York Stock Exchange.
 A spokesman at the company, Matt Samuel, said it had not been contacted by Justice Department officials.
 Marvin Smilon, a spokesman for the United States attorney in New York, did not return a phone call seeking comment.
 Two months ago, the company lowered its estimates of proven oil and gas reserves by about 20 percent, or 3.9 billion barrels. Company documents from two years ago show that current and former top executives were aware of a significant shortfall in reserves and came up with an ''external storyline'' and ''investor relations script'' that minimized its significance. 
 Two weeks ago, the group dismissed its chairman, Sir Philip Watts, and its head of exploration and production, Walter van de Vijver. 
 Sir Philip was succeeded by Jeroen van der Veer. The 2002 documents describing the shortfall in reserves were sent to the committee of managing directors, which at the time included Mr. van der Veer. A memorandum dated July 18, 2002, and sent to the managing directors and Judy Boynton, the current chief financial officer, predicted a ''shortfall'' of two billion to three billion barrels of reserves.
 An earlier note to the committee, dated Feb. 11, said that the equivalent of 1 billion barrels of reserves ''are no longer fully aligned with the S.E.C. rules'' and that 1.3 billion barrels were at risk because it was no longer certain that they could be extracted during the remaining term of licenses between the company and three foreign countries.
 Reserves are an important asset of any oil and natural gas company. In the 1990's, Shell found itself in an increasingly difficult position as it was unable to find enough new natural gas and oil to offset exhausted reserves to keep up with production. The fall in the so-called reserve replacement ratio troubled analysts and investors because it is a crucial measure of an oil company's prospects. 
 Company documents show that senior executives ignored warnings over several years of the possible inflation of reserves. The documents show that the executives were concerned that Shell was falling behind its rivals in maintaining its reserve replacement ratio. Most of the misstated reserves were recorded from 1997 to 2000, when Sir Philip was in charge of exploration and production.
 In recent months, the company has been preparing for an onslaught of regulatory examinations and shareholder lawsuits. It has retained one American law firm, Davis, Polk & Wardwell, to conduct an internal review with its audit committee. A second law firm, Debevoise & Plimpton, has been hired to handle investor suits and the S.E.C. inquiry. European lawyers have been retained to handle the inquiries overseas.
 The company is planning to complete an internal review by its audit committee in the next few weeks, and Mr. van der Veer has said the results will be made public.

PERSON: CESAR A. PERALES

HEADLINE: Back in the Fight He Picked Decades Ago

BYLINE: By LYNDA RICHARDSON

 BODY:
CESAR A. PERALES, the president of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, is revved up. But he is not losing his cool. (He is too cool for that.) He is talking about the fund's wranglings in federal court over the attempt by Freehold Borough in Monmouth County, N.J., to prevent day laborers from gathering at a vacant lot to scout for work. 
 ''The question of the treatment of day laborers is so flagrant, I feel it viscerally,'' Mr. Perales says, leaning over to emphasize the point. ''This is to me as horrific as the segregation that the government imposed in the South. We're seeing local governments treating undocumented workers in a similar fashion, marginalizing them, not wanting them to live where they live. This is a fight that will take a long time.'' 
 Mr. Perales, 63, knows something about a good fight. Near his desk is a framed newspaper photograph, one that has an almost antique quality to it. Taken in 1970, it shows him standing at the door of an East Harlem church that the Young Lords, a militant rights group, took over to provide services like breakfast and classes to poor Latinos. ''Lawyer for the Lords,'' the photo caption says. Mr. Perales chuckles at his younger self; the longish hair, the large dark sunshades and wide suit lapels.
 ''I'm a product of a time when I believed the only way to make change was to do it yourself, and it's never left me,'' he says. He wears pinstripes now.
 Mr. Perales has been very much embedded in the system since the days of the Young Lords. He served as deputy mayor under David N. Dinkins, state social services commissioner under Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and assistant secretary of health, education and welfare under President Jimmy Carter. He also was a senior vice president at New York-Presbyterian Hospital.
 He returned to the fund last summer to rescue it from a severe financial crisis. The fund had become crippled by poor management, making donors skittish. Its staff was working as little as half time. The fund was months behind on its rent. This is the third time Mr. Perales has headed the fund since he helped found it as a public-interest law group in 1972, and now he plans to be around for a long while. 
 It is late afternoon, and his TriBeCa office is dark. He is asked, piteously, if the financial situation is so dire that he is conserving electricity. He smiles slightly and flips on the light switch. He had simply forgotten.
 Mr. Perales says enthusiastically that the fund, with a budget of $1.8 million, is on the upswing, repaying creditors, bringing the staff back full time. He plans a renovation of the offices. 
 ''There is a sense that things are turning around,'' he says. ''Clearly, we are getting support from places that were doubtful when I arrived here. I'm committed to making this place once again an essential institution.''
 The passion of his youth is there, even if his hair is steel gray. He is a grandfather of three. He is married for the third time, to a physician, Dr. Concha Mendoza. He has a relaxed manner, though his appointment calendar is booked solid. A tuxedo hangs in a corner for a gala fundraising event of an Hispanic organization that evening. The next morning, he gets on a 6 a.m. train to Baltimore to give a speech at the University of Maryland Law School.
 It is no surprise that the fund is getting attention on the day laborer class-action suit. This was Mr. Perales's plan. He is known as media savvy, and knew this case had legs. He contends that the borough has violated the workers' civil rights by harassing them and preventing them from seeking work. 
 ''I made sure this was a very important issue for us,'' he says, adding that the fund was facing the question of relevancy when he returned as interim president.
 ''I had to show very clearly we are going to protect the rights of recently arrived immigrants, who, unlike Puerto Ricans, are not citizens and that the issue of the exploitation of immigrant workers is the issue of the day,'' he says.
 HE walks down the hallway and into a conference room. Lawyers are interviewing a Mexican day laborer who informs them of more arrests of immigrant laborers in New Jersey towns. ''This whole office has been fired up over the last few months,'' Mr. Perales says. 
 In federal court last week, Freehold lawyers agreed to allow immigrants to gather on public land to scout for work. But the dispute continues. Mr. Perales says the site still is essentially closed, but an attorney for Freehold, Robert Podvey, says the public portion of the land has reopened, while the private portion has not. 
 Mr. Perales says the fund will be back in court. And he looks forward to talking with more laborers. He is comfortable in their world. He is the son of Dominican and Puerto Rican factory laborers. Raised in Upper Manhattan, he studied law at Fordham Law School with the hope of changing the world.
 He has a wry smile. It feels like old times.
 ''The way people treat one another has not changed that much,'' he says. ''The injustice is alive and well.''

HEADLINE: Environment Heads the List Of Trade Center Concerns

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
It is hard to imagine a 2,000-page document missing anything. But critical comments on the draft environmental impact statement for the World Trade Center rebuilding project generally fault it more for what it does not say than for what it does.
 The comments, which were due Monday but kept trickling in yesterday to the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, urged officials to assess more carefully and comprehensively the cumulative effects of several big projects -- the office towers and memorial, the PATH terminal, the Fulton Street Transit Center and the reconstruction of West Street-Route 9A -- that have been separated for public review. 
 They also asked for a more detailed examination of what may be at least a decade's worth of diminished air quality, increased noise and aggravated traffic.
 ''The failure to consider the cumulative impact on air quality of all related Lower Manhattan construction projects may constitute a segmentation of the project and expose the project to litigation,'' said a comment from the Civic Alliance to Rebuild Downtown New York, a group of 27 planning, environmental, civic, neighborhood and other groups.
 Verizon raised a related concern. That company has an enormous stake in the future of the trade center site because of its central office and switching center at 140 West Street, one block to the north, which was heavily damaged on Sept. 11, 2001.
 ''While Verizon is supportive of the redevelopment of Lower Manhattan, the most troubling aspect of the proposed construction is the lack of coordination among the respective New York State and New York City agencies,'' the company said in its comments. ''The absence of synchronization with respect to the proposed projects will undoubtedly have severe impacts on Verizon and the residents and businesses of Lower Manhattan.''
 In its comments, the federal Environmental Protection Agency gave the draft document a rating of EC-2, meaning both that the agency has ''environmental concerns'' and that the document does not yet contain enough information for a full assessment.
 Among other points, the agency asked for further analysis of nitrogen oxide and ozone levels, more information on the potential impact of pollutants in storm-water runoff and a discussion of the effect on air quality of buses idling on Greenwich Street.
 The city's Environmental Protection Department submitted 12 suggestions and questions, asking where the water in the memorial pools would come from. ''If the city is the water source, is there a plan in place to deal with drought emergencies?'' wrote Darryl H. Cabbagestalk, the agency's director of project management for New York City projects. 
 Rather than respond point by point, Kevin M. Rampe, the president of the development corporation, said yesterday: ''We've really exhibited all along a willingness to expose our drafts and have a conversation and take in comments and incorporate them in meaningful ways. And we look forward to doing that here.'' The final document is expected to be submitted next month for a vote by the corporation board.
 Noting that there were already plans to establish coordination among the construction projects by various agencies, Mr. Rampe said, ''It's critical that we all take into account the cumulative impacts and take steps to mitigate those impacts.'' 
 Physically, the bulk of the comments came from Gateway Plaza in Battery Park City, opposing the possible construction of a tunnel under West Street, even though it is not technically part of the development corporation's impact statement. Some 120 tenants signed their names to form letters describing the tunnel project as a ''multiyear construction purgatory'' that ''will be a disaster for downtown residents and workers.''

HEADLINE: Fed Statement About Rates

 BODY:
Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed's monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided to leave interest rates unchanged:
 The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 1 percent. 
 The committee continues to believe that an accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing important ongoing support to economic activity. The evidence accumulated over the intermeeting period indicates that output is continuing to expand at a solid pace. Although job losses have slowed, new hiring has lagged. Increases in core consumer prices are muted and expected to remain low.
 The committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal. The probability of an unwelcome fall in inflation has diminished in recent months and now appears almost equal to that of a rise in inflation. With inflation quite low and resource use slack, the committee believes that it can be patient in removing its policy accommodation. 
 Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, vice chairman; Ben S. Bernanke; Susan S. Bies; Roger W. Ferguson Jr.; Edward M. Gramlich; Thomas M. Hoenig; Donald L. Kohn; Cathy E. Minehan; Mark W. Olson; Sandra Pianalto; and William Poole.

HEADLINE: Tokyo Officials Struggle to Hold the Yen in Line

BYLINE: By TODD ZAUN

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 16 

 BODY:
Japanese financial authorities are waging a battle against what they see as one of the biggest threats to the nation's economic recovery -- a rising yen. And while the effort seems to be working so far, analysts and investors are questioning how long they can keep it up.
 After a year of steady gains against the dollar, the yen weakened to a five-month low, around 112 yen, this month from about 106 yen in early February. The change in direction for the Japanese currency was a relief to the country's exporters whose profits are crimped by too much yen strength. 
 But the cost was steep: Tokyo spent record amounts to hold its currency back by selling yen and buying dollars. Japan sold 10.5 trillion yen ($95.2 billion) in the two months ended Feb. 26, already more than half last year's 20 trillion yen, a record. Through such transactions, Japan has accumulated the largest foreign-currency reserves in the world, at $777 billion, much of it invested in United States government debt. Japanese investors accounted for about half the purchases of United States Treasury securities last year.
 Despite the heavy intervention, the Japanese currency is again inching up on the dollar, rising to around 109 yen on Tuesday from around 111 on Friday, amid speculation in foreign exchange markets that Japan will not be able to maintain the immense yen sales for long. 
 While some analysts agree that Japan may scale back its yen sales, many others say financial authorities will probably continue to protect the country's exports -- by keeping the yen from rising much. 
 Intervening in currency markets has so far been relatively painless to Japan because, with short-term money market rates practically at the vanishing point (0.01 percent), the cost of financing even huge dollar purchases is very low. And because Japan is selling its own currency, rather than that of another country, it has an almost unlimited ability to intervene in currency markets. 
 Technically, there is a legal limit on how much the country can borrow to finance intervention, but the limit is so high there is little chance of running up against it. This month, the Parliament authorized the Ministry of Finance to borrow an additional 40 trillion yen to finance currency intervention -- double the total sold last year. 
 Of course, Japan has to pay back the money it borrows for intervention, but given the ephemeral rates of interest it must pay, there has been little concern so far that it might be unable to do that. 
 The bigger worry is what the consequences of such intervention could be to the economy over the long run. The Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, in a speech this month, called the scale of Japan's dollar purchases ''awesome'' and warned that such huge intervention in currency markets could become ''problematic'' for Japan.
 Despite such warnings, Japan's financial authorities have given no indication that they are wavering in their resolve to cap any gains in the yen. 
 ''There is no change in our policy,'' Finance Minister Sadakazu Tanigaki said at a regular news conference in Tokyo on Tuesday. ''We will firmly maintain our policy of taking appropriate action if there are rapid moves in foreign exchange rates.'' 
 The yen strengthened nonetheless to 108.9 yen Tuesday after a report in The Nikkei Financial Daily that the government would probably scale back yen sales after the end of Japan's fiscal year on March 31. 
 A rise in the yen before the end of the fiscal year would reduce profits for the export companies that have been leading Japan's economic recovery by reducing the value of their overseas earnings. Although there are signs that Japan's economy is gaining strength, two fledgling recoveries have died in the last decade, and policy makers want to make sure that does not occur again.
 Keeping the yen weak has the added benefit of helping Japan in its battle against deflation, a major impediment to a full economic recovery. A falling yen makes imported goods more expensive, helping to offset price declines at home.
 ''As long as Japan has deflation, that's the first thing it should worry about,'' Richard Jerram, chief economist at ING Securities in Tokyo, said. ''There's no reason for them to stop intervening in currency markets.''
 Deflation hurts the economy because lower prices translate into lower revenues for companies. Deflation also stifles consumption as people postpone big purchases for a lower price in the future.
 At some point, of course, the flood of yen that financial officials pump into the market when they buy dollars could set off inflation -- the danger Mr. Greenspan hinted at. But that is a distant concern. Japanese consumer prices fell 2.6 percent last quarter from a year ago, as measured by the G.D.P. deflator.
 ''Worrying about deflation is like a starving man worrying about his cholesterol level,'' Mr. Jerram of ING said.
 Many market analysts say the yen would probably continue to rally even without the government's huge dollar purchases, given the gradually improving economy and bloated trade surplus. And so, Japan is likely to continue buying dollars for the time being. 
 When will Japanese authorities ease up on their yen selling? Economists say there are a couple of possible situations that might lead Japan to curtail its meddling in currency markets.
 The first is the emergence of a more durable economic recovery in the United States that would prompt the Fed to begin raising interest rates more quickly than is currently expected, a move that would probably push up the dollar.
 Satoru Ogasawara, an economist for Credit Suisse First Boston in Tokyo, said that even without intervention by Japan he expected that a year from now the yen would have weakened to about 117 yen as the Fed lifts interest rates later this year.
 Tokyo could also lose its reason for intervening if Japan's own economic recovery really takes off, with more consumption and capital spending shifting some of the burden off exports. 
 There are already signs that may be happening. The government, in a monthly economic report released by the Cabinet Office on Monday, said spending by consumers was ''picking up.'' On the same day, a report showed that sales at department stores in the Tokyo area, a crucial indicator of consumer sentiment, rose in February for the first time in more than two years. This month, Japan revised down its growth figures for the quarter ended in December, to 6.4 percent, from a preliminary estimate of 7 percent. Still, the last quarter of 2003 was Japan's strongest since the collapse of its stock and real estate bubble in 1990.
 ''If this trend continues, Japan won't have an excuse to intervene,'' Mr. Ogasawara says.

HEADLINE: Office Building Is Part of Yonkers Revival

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: YONKERS 

 BODY:
A $12.5 million, 70,000-square-foot structure that is the first office building to be built in this city in more than two decades is nearing completion next to the waterfront as part of an extensive downtown redevelopment. 
 The six-story brick building, which is being financed with public and private money, is rising alongside a 600-space municipal parking garage, luxury apartment towers, a $53 million municipal building that is also home to the main branch of the Yonkers Public Library, and other recently renovated structures.
 Because of its proximity to a Metro-North Railroad station, as well as to a planned stop on a high-speed commuter ferry run, the six-story brick office building is being marketed to financial firms, lawyers, accountants and others who would benefit by being near New York City, said David Landes, president of Royal Properties, the leasing agent for the building. The Hudson River ferry service, which will serve Battery Park, 34th Street and the Yonkers pier, is expected to begin this summer. 
 Station Plaza, as the new building has been named, is being financed with a $1 million grant from the city of Yonkers, construction loans from Chinatrust Bank (U.S.A.) and equity from the developer, Homes for America Holdings.
 The company, an eight-year-old real estate investment and management company that specializes in neighborhood revitalization, buys undervalued or problem properties and enhances them, said Robert MacFarlane, a co-founder of the for-profit concern. Homes for America Holdings' current portfolio includes 1,700 multifamily units, 800,000 square feet of commercial space and more than 600 condominiums in Texas, Indiana, Connecticut and Florida.
 The Yonkers project is in ''an area of the city that has been down at the heels for quite a while,'' said Mr. MacFarlane, who is also president of a business improvement district that includes his building and others along the 4.25-mile-long waterfront. 
 The new office building will rent for $23 a square foot, with spaces available from 2,000 to 10,000 square feet, Mr. Landes said. Homes for America Holdings, now based in a nearby industrial park, will occupy one floor of the new building. The building's first floor will be leased to retail businesses and restaurants. Construction is to be completed this spring, with the first occupants arriving in the fall. 
 The salmon-colored brick structure, which sits on a corner lot that was razed by the city for the project, has been designed by Grad Associates in Newark. Vasant Kshirsagar, a principal of the architecture firm, said he planned the new structure to blend in with the neighborhood.
 ''Station Plaza draws from surrounding buildings such as the U.S. Post Office and the train station to establish its scale, mass and urban character,'' Mr. Kshirsagar said. 
 All offices on the top four floors of will have clear views of the Hudson River and the Palisades.
 Station Plaza is eligible for incentives for economic development and job creation under New York State's Empire Zone program. Because it is in an area designated as an Empire Zone, the building is eligible for 100 percent property tax reimbursements for 10 years and then declining reductions for a period after that. 
 It is also eligible for a 10-year exemption from state sales tax on purchases of goods and services, and a wage credit equal to $3,000 an employee per year for up to five years for companies hiring full-time workers in newly created jobs.
 The Yonkers Empire Zone covers two square miles in several areas throughout the city, said Edward Sheeran, special assistant to the mayor for economic development. ''It is hoped that Station Plaza will mark the beginning of a resurgence in office development in the city,'' he said. About 170,000 square feet of office space is being planned for a nearby industrial park, the former site of Otis Elevator, which left in 1972.
 On the waterfront, the 266-unit Hudson Park is under construction by Collins Enterprises, the first residential developer in downtown Yonkers in more than 30 years.
 Arthur Collins, a principal in the development and management company, which is based in Stamford, Conn., said that about 75 percent of the first tower and 50 percent of the second were leased in the apartment buildings that opened last year.
 Next to the apartments, Metro-North has undertaken a $35 million renovation of its historic Beaux-Arts station.
 The revived waterfront also features Esplanade Park, with a 1.5-mile-long promenade.

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: Albany: Consumer Group Opposes Con Ed Increases

BYLINE: By Ian Urbina (NYT); Compiled by Ian Urbina

 BODY:
The New York State Consumer Protection Board filed testimony with the state Public Service Commission yesterday opposing rate increases requested by Consolidated Edison for its natural gas and steam operations. In November, Con Ed proposed rate increases of 9.8 percent for its natural gas operations and 14.6 percent for its steam operations. Those increases, which are still being considered by the commission, would be effective on Oct. 1 of this year. Jon Sorensen, a spokesman for the consumer board, said that the utility's last increase for gas prices was in 1995 and for steam in 2000. He added that the utility could avoid requiring a rate increase by better economizing current revenues. David C. Flanagan, a commission spokesman, said that additional testimony was expected in the coming weeks and that a hearing was scheduled for next month. Ian Urbina (NYT)

HEADLINE: A Possible Leak of Survey Data Draws Federal Attention

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON and JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Federal investigators and the University of Michigan are looking into what they suspect was an early leak of data from the university's influential consumer sentiment survey, which has the potential to move the stock and bond markets.
 The inquiry involves the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Securities and Exchange Commission, and comes just months after a former economist at Goldman Sachs pleaded guilty to insider trading based on illegal access to information about the Treasury Department's bond sales. 
 Other economic indicators have from time to time been mistakenly released early or leaked, though few such incidents have invited formal scrutiny from regulators.
 The investigation in Michigan centers on the preliminary estimate of the university's monthly Surveys of Consumers, which was released on Feb. 13. 
 A spokesman for Richard T. Curtin, the director of the university's Institute for Social Research, said that Market News International, a news service, published an article including the survey's results ''several hours'' before the data was released to survey subscribers. Attempts to obtain comment from Tony Mace, the managing editor of Market News International, were not successful. But he was quoted by Bloomberg News as saying that ''we did not publish their numbers early.'' 
 University officials would not say how the news agency obtained the information. Bond prices rose modestly and stock prices were little changed on the morning of the leak.
 The midmonth report is a preliminary estimate of the full-month figures that are formally released to subscribers on the first Tuesday of each month. The research institute tries to limit access to the midmonth figures, but news services routinely obtain the numbers from subscribers soon after the conference call ends, even though subscribers agree not to release the information outside their companies.
 The numbers have been the subject of ''various rumors'' in the past, but this is the first investigation of unauthorized access, according to Diane Swanbrow, a spokeswoman for the institute in Ann Arbor.
 The figures on Feb. 13 were well below economists' estimates, falling 10.7 points, to 93.1. Economists expected a decline of less than 1 point from January's figure, which had indicated the highest level of consumer optimism in more than three years. 
 It is unclear if the move in bond and stock prices that day was directly influenced by the leak or by some other news event. 
 The price of 10-year Treasury bond futures did rise in early trading on Feb. 13, from the price in late trading the day before, according to Bloomberg data. The late trading price on Feb. 12 was 114 15/32; at around 8:30 a.m. on Feb. 13, the price was 114 28/32. 
 But stocks showed little movement. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index opened on Feb. 13 at 9:30 a.m. at just about the same level it closed at the day before, and fell only 0.6 percent during the day.
 ''I recall someone saying that the Michigan number was released early, and it got the market going,'' said James M. Keller, executive vice president in charge of bond trading at Pimco Advisors, the giant asset management firm.
 A bond market analyst who spoke on the condition of not being identified said: ''There are always accusations flying around that someone had the data early when it's not official government data, like the Michigan survey. But this time, there was more chatter about this release.''
 Feb. 13, a Friday, was the last day of trading before the President's Day holiday, and bond markets closed early. Trading ahead of holidays is sometimes volatile, because volume is lower and a few big trades can move the market more than on a normal day.
 Subscribers to the data -- typically investment banks and brokers -- pay $4,650 a year for access to the University of Michigan figures. 
 In November 1998, the Bureau of Labor Statistics unintentionally posted part of its closely guarded jobs report on the Internet a day before its scheduled release.
 Some government data is regularly circulated to top government officials in advance of its release.

HEADLINE: U.S. Professors Rush to India to Study Rush of U.S. Jobs There

BYLINE: By SARITHA RAI

DATELINE: BANGALORE, India, March 16 

 BODY:
India's almost magnetic ability to bring in jobs has incited more than just fiery rhetoric from labor unions and accusations from John Kerry that American bosses are behaving like Benedict Arnold by sending precious jobs overseas.
 It is also attracting scholars. Lots of them.
 Each week, for example, Sachin Mulay, a strategic marketing manager with India's leading software services firm, Wipro Limited, is overwhelmed with e-mail messages from American universities proposing visits to the company or inviting Wipro executives to speak about the phenomenon of outsourcing. 
 ''There's a tremendous interest in understanding two things,'' said Patrick T. Harker, dean of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, ''the emergence of the Indian economy on the global scene, and its important role in the decoupling of services from where work is done and where it is delivered.''
 India is so hot, Mr. Harker said, that almost every faculty member at Wharton wanted to visit. ''When a phenomenon bursts on the scene, people struggle to understand it,'' he said. ''Academics are getting asked questions all the time.''
 In the last few months, the Bangalore-based Wipro alone has had a dozen visits by students and faculty of top United States colleges, and 10 more are scheduled in the coming months. A competitor, Infosys Technologies, also in Bangalore, has had eight student groups visit in the same period.
 Researchers at schools like the Kellogg School of Management, the University of California at Berkeley and the Columbia Business School are studying India's intellectual base, and the trials that software services companies face as they compete globally.
 ''Outsourcing is seen as the next major issue that corporations in the United States will be grappling with,'' said Partha Iyengar, vice president for research at Gartner India, a technology research and consulting company.
 ''The faculty are trying to establish themselves as experts, which then typically begets prestige, grants and fame,'' said Mr. Iyengar, who, in addition to conference calls with clients, investment banks and investors, now gets calls from American professors. 
 At Wharton, at least 20 faculty members are researching outsourcing. ''Increasing numbers of our students -- not students of Indian origin -- are asking to be placed in India,'' Dean Harker said while on a visit to India last year.
 At the Sloan School of Management of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, outsourcing is drawing an overflow of M.B.A. students to a new course that focuses on the variety of economic, technological, managerial and organizational factors in corporate decisions to transfer white-collar jobs to other countries.
 Lester Thurow, a former Sloan School dean and one of the class's teachers, said outsourcing is not only a major political issue, but also one of real relevance to M.B.A.'s. ''Professional outsourcing creates a world where losses often occur at the top rather than the bottom of the pyramid,'' Professor Thurow said. ''Naturally, our students need the skills to navigate in such a new environment.''
 Infosys, the subject of case studies at Wharton, the Harvard Business School and the Stern School of Business at New York University, is seeing an increase in case study requests from academicians. Its chairman and founder, N.R. Narayana Murthy, has delivered lectures at Stanford, Wharton and Cornell.
 At Fordham University in New York, research on outsourcing is thriving. Sumita Raghuram, associate professor of management systems, is designing a study that will examine the role of cultural sensitivity in outsourcing.
 Students are interested in pursuing careers in dynamic economies, said Mr. Harker, ''and India is undoubtedly one of them.'' He said both India and China, with their impressive gross domestic product rates, are attractive to students and academicians alike. ''Today, every other country in the world is trying to reposition itself to compete with India and China,'' he said.
 Few have tracked outsourcing more closely than AnnaLee Saxenian, a professor at Berkeley and one of the trend's early researchers. ''The speed with which this phenomenon has taken off has amazed me,'' said Professor Saxenian.
 By contrast with today, she said that on her first visit to India in 1997, American companies were highly skeptical of the idea of doing business there.
 Vivek Paul, vice chairman of Wipro, said, ''The rapid acceptance of offshoring of services is viewed by academia as being part of a huge change still in its infancy, with much yet to be discovered.''
 He added, ''Students are eager to learn how this trend will affect employment opportunities, what entrepreneurial openings this may create and what skills are required to succeed in the new world.''
 Mr. Paul, who is based in Wipro's American headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., has lectured at Purdue University, Berkeley, Columbia Business School and the Kellogg School of Management.
 Some of this academic interest is translating into requests for internships. Intel's India unit is receiving more resumes from students, not of Indian origin, from universities like Stanford and Chicago.
 The internship program at Infosys, India's second-largest software services company, received 3,000 applications last year for 33 positions from students at such schools as Princeton, M.I.T., Stanford, Carnegie-Mellon, Chicago and Michigan. 
 Like students, some career-driven Americans appear eager to experience the country firsthand.
 Catalytic Software, a software services firm in Seattle founded by two former Microsoft employees, has most of its development operations in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad. The firm is finding a sea change in attitudes towards relocating to India.
 ''When I moved here four years ago, I was regarded as being brave and unusual,'' said its chief executive and co-founder, Swain Porter. ''People stared.'' Now, some of its employees based in the United States are asking to be posted in Hyderabad.
 ''The new global perception is that India has arrived on the world scene by transforming into a thriving modern economy; the energy that creates is very attractive to newcomers,'' said Mr. Porter, who oversees the firm's Indian operations.
 Catalytic's 120 employees include 12 Americans living in India. 
 ''People want to be on the ground floor of India's emergence,'' Mr. Porter said, ''For many U.S. firms, India has become an economic ally helping reduce costs, increase scale and reduce time to market.''
 For Indian outsourcing companies, interaction with American academia is helping deal with the backlash against outsourcing. ''There is much debate in the media about the impact of globalization of services that is unnecessarily controversial,'' said Mr. Paul of Wipro, ''and academia can bring the rigor of thought to this discussion.''

HEADLINE: Shares Rise on Fed's Sign of Sustained Low Interest Rates

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks ended higher yesterday after the Federal Reserve opted to keep interest rates unchanged at 46-year lows and signaled that it was not in a rush to raise borrowing costs amid sluggish job creation.
 In a session marked by wild swings after the Fed's comments, the Dow Jones industrial average ended with the largest gains, spurred by an upbeat earnings report from the diversified manufacturer 3M. 
 The Fed rate-setting committee repeated that it could afford to be patient about raising rates, implying that policy makers feel little pressure to raise credit costs despite a strengthening economy, because inflation remains muted and job growth is anemic. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average ended up 81.78 points, or 0.8 percent, at 10,184.67. The Nasdaq composite index was up 3.9 points, or 0.2 percent, at 1,943.09. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 6.21 points, or 0.6 percent, at 1,110.70.
 Trading was active, with 1.5 billion shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange, just above the 1.4 billion daily average for last year. About 2 billion shares were traded on the Nasdaq, above the 1.8 billion daily average last year.
 Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 7 to 5 on the New York Stock Exchange, and decliners outpaced advancers 8 to 7 on the Nasdaq.
 Shares of 3M, seen as a bellwether for American industry, rose $3.94, to $78.81. The company, a maker of a range of products including Post-it notes and drugs, increased its profit estimates for the first quarter and full year.
 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the Hollywood studio company, rose $1.95, to $18.15. The company confirmed that it was considering paying a one-time dividend distribution to investors as part of its pledge to return money to shareholders.
 Community First Bankshares rallied to close up $4.11, to $32.11. The French bank BNP Paribas said that its United States arm, BancWest, would buy Community First for $1.2 billion, pushing deeper into United States retail banking. BancWest will pay $32.25 cash for each Community First share.
 Shares of Lehman Brothers, one of Wall Street's biggest investment banks, rose 39 cents, to $85.04. The company said quarterly profit more than doubled, driven by higher revenue from bond and equity trading, stock sales and mergers.
 Treasury bond prices rose after the Fed sounded a fresh note of caution on the labor market and reiterated its pledge to be patient on increasing rates.
 By late in the day, the price of the benchmark 10-year note rose 22/32, to 102 20/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, dropped to 3.68 percent from 3.76 percent on Monday.
 Here are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of four-week bills:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)

Price: 99.925
High Rate: 0.960
Coupon Yield: 0.978

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Fighting Mexican Taxes On Beverages

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 16 

 BODY:
The United States filed a complaint on Tuesday with the World Trade Organization accusing Mexico of imposing unfair taxes on beverages sweetened by high fructose corn syrup.
 Mexico imposed a 20 percent sales tax in January 2002 on soft drinks and other beverages that do not use cane sugar as a sweetener and another 20 percent tax on the distribution of the drinks. 
 The United States trade representative, Robert B. Zoellick, said in a statement that the taxes had hurt corn exports to Mexico and that they violated global trade laws. 
 ''Mexico's beverage taxes are discriminatory and protectionist,'' he said. ''This administration will continue to work to make sure Americans are treated fairly and that there is a level playing field for our exports.''
 Members of Congress asked Mr. Zoellick to bring the case after corn farmers and agribusinesses like Archer Daniels Midland and Corn Products International asserted that the soft drink tax had hurt their ability to export corn.
 For its part, Mexico released a statement on Tuesday saying the issue was part of a larger problem of United States restrictions on Mexican sugar imports in what it said was a violation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. The Mexican department of the economy said it was prepared to defend the taxes before the trade organization.
 The United States won a case with the trade organization in 2001 that overturned antidumping duties imposed by Mexico against imported high fructose corn syrup.
 Earlier, Mexico asserted that the United States had flooded the country with subsidized corn, which undermined their farmers and their sugar industry when the corn was processed into high fructose corn syrup.
 The United States gives $19 billion a year in subsidies to farmers for growing corn, wheat, soybeans, cotton and rice. These subsidies, as well as those of other wealthy nations, are at the heart of the current impasse in trade talks at the W.T.O.

HEADLINE: For Bank Chief, Buying Big Rival Is Only the First Part of the Deal

BYLINE: By RIVA D. ATLAS

 BODY:
Kenneth D. Lewis is making the biggest bet of his career.
 Fresh from settling regulators' complaints about mutual fund trading improprieties, Mr. Lewis, the chief executive of Bank of America, will take the microphone today, a block away from the bank's headquarters in Charlotte, N.C., to urge shareholders to vote for his bank's $48 billion acquisition of FleetBoston Financial. 
 The purchase is the most brazen move yet by Mr. Lewis, who began his career as a credit analyst at the bank 35 years ago. He built his reputation as lieutenant to Hugh McColl Jr., the bank's longtime chief executive and Mr. Lewis's predecessor, who completed a dizzying stream of deals that Mr. Lewis made work. 
 But recently, Mr. Lewis has put shareholders on edge. Bank of America's stock price has lagged that of its peers over worries that he is overpaying for FleetBoston and because of the bank's role in a series of financial scandals, including mutual fund trading and the collapse of Parmalat. 
 ''The reputation that management built over the last few years is shot,'' said Richard Bove, a banking analyst at Hoefer & Arnett, an independent research firm, in a report this month, adding that Bank of America ''is now selling at the lowest price-to-earnings multiple of the largest 100 banks in the United States.''
 On Monday, Mr. Lewis took a step toward restoring that credibility, as Bank of America and FleetBoston announced that they would jointly pay $675 million to resolve an investigation into trading in their mutual funds, eliminating one cloud over the merger. 
 Now Mr. Lewis must prove that FleetBoston is worth the price. Bank of America is paying a 40 percent premium to FleetBoston's price before the merger was announced. Shareholders of both banks are expected to vote in favor of the deal, which regulators have already approved.
 Whether the deal succeeds rests largely on Mr. Lewis's ability to continue the bank's strong growth in consumer banking. Bank of America, already the largest consumer bank in the nation, will control 10 percent of the country's deposits after the FleetBoston merger. 
 The consumer business has been robust for Bank of America and other banks the last three years, but Mr. Lewis acknowledges that growth will slow once interest rates rise and as consumers shift money away from banks. He expects the bank's deposits to grow just 3 percent to 4 percent this year, compared with 10 percent in 2003.
 Still, Mr. Lewis is confident he will quickly prove his deal's doubters wrong. ''Whatever our growth winds up being, we will outperform the market,'' he said in an interview.
 As evidence, he points to his earnings record. ''We've exceeded expectations for the last 12 quarters,'' he said, ''and we've gotten to like that.''
 The merger with FleetBoston is Mr. Lewis's first big acquisition since becoming chief executive in April 2001. He wanted FleetBoston so badly that he outbid Wachovia, Bank One and Citigroup, a person briefed on the negotiations said.
 Analysts and others who know him assert that Mr. Lewis, a veteran of dozens of mergers, will find costs to cut to make the deal work. 
 If he cannot meet the promised goal of $1.1 billion, after taxes, in annual cost savings from the merger, he will find the money elsewhere in the bank to trim expenses, analysts said. Mr. Lewis may have to cut 9,000 to 11,000 jobs, out of a combined work force of more than 180,000 employees, Gerard Cassidy, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, estimated.
 Mr. Lewis declined to comment on job reductions, although he has promised that employment levels in New England will remain unchanged.
 It was Mr. Lewis's reputation for taking modest risks and keeping an eye on costs that lulled investors into thinking that he would not be tempted to do any big, expensive deals.
 When he took over from Mr. McColl, the bank was suffering in a slowing economy and saddled with fallout from the mergers. 
 Mr. Lewis quickly got the bank out of volatile areas. He reduced Bank of America's holdings of corporate loans and exited businesses like subprime mortgages and auto leasing. 
 He focused on the more predictable business of consumer banking, improving service and enticing individuals to open new bank accounts. The year that Mr. Lewis took over, Bank of America was losing customers, with a 163,000 decline in new savings accounts. Last year, it attracted 640,000 new savings customers. It opened 1.24 million checking accounts, compared with just 193,000 in 2001.
 ''We are changing the basic thrust of the company from an acquisition and thus, expense-driven, model to a customer-focused, revenue-driven organization,'' Mr. Lewis told investors at a December 2000 conference.
 That quote resurfaced last October, just after the FleetBoston purchase was announced, on Bankstocks.com, a Web site run by Thomas Brown, an investor and longtime critic of Bank of America and its predecessors. 
 ''How could you, Ken Lewis?'' Mr. Brown wrote in a commentary.
 About the same time, Bank of America's name surfaced in a growing number of financial scandals. It has resolved an inquiry into improper trading in its mutual funds, but regulators are still studying the bank's role in financing Parmalat. The bank is also the subject of a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into trading in its investment banking division. 
 The scandals, along with anxieties about the FleetBoston merger, have taken their toll on Bank of America's stock. Since the merger was announced, its shares have fallen 2 percent, compared with an 8 percent increase in the Philadelphia Stock Exchange/KBW Banks Index.
 Mr. Lewis may have not kept the bank away from scandal or mistakes, but supporters say he is quick to fix problems once they arise. 
 ''We will be defined by how we react as much as we will by what happened,'' Mr. Lewis said of the mutual fund scandal in an interview this year.
 Mr. Lewis and his colleagues assert that investors should not view this purchase as a departure from Mr. Lewis's strategy.
 ''He did not say that there won't be mergers, but that they were not necessary'' for the bank to increase its profitability, said Walter Massey, president of Morehouse College and a Bank of America board member. ''The bank has the resources to make acquisitions if opportunities present themselves.''
 Mr. Lewis is hoping to capitalize on years of weak performance at FleetBoston, which has just started to recover from its own series of mergers.
 FleetBoston did not aggressively market mortgages within its branches, for example, and offers only one type of credit card, said Barbara Desoer, head of consumer products. At Bank of America, customers can choose from a range of cards with various types of rates or rewards.
 The broader geographic reach may also attract business. Bank of America already has a number of customers who spend the winter in Florida and live in the Northeast the rest of the year. Mr. Lewis plans to convert the FleetBoston technology systems to those of Bank of America, so that its customers can seamlessly make deposits when they travel up and down the coast, he said.
 In the Northeast, though, Mr. Lewis will encounter one of the most competitive banking markets in the country. In New York City alone, close to 100 branches have opened in the two years ended last June, the most recent data available. 
 Some stock analysts say the size and geographic diversity will keep profits growing, even if at a slower rate. And several analysts are recommending Bank of America's stock, because it is trading so low.
 ''At a certain price, you just have to hold your nose and wade right in,'' said Nancy Bush, an independent bank analyst in Annandale, N.J.

HEADLINE: In Brazil, Chafing at Economic Restraints

BYLINE: By TONY SMITH

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, March 16 

 BODY:
As the refrigerators roll off the production line at Metalfrio Solutions, Brazil's leading manufacturer of commercial iceboxes and freezers, its chairman, Marcelo Faria de Lima, voices a concern that is typical of Brazilian business executives these days: has President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's embrace of orthodox, pro-market policies turned into a bear hug that is suffocating Brazil's economy? 
 ''Lula's economic policy in his first year in office made all the sense in the world,'' Mr. Lima said. ''Inflation was verging on 30 percent, and the real was way over 3.60 to the dollar. 
 ''But now,'' he said, ''with the country showing negative growth and inflation at a completely acceptable level, it seems to me that insisting on high interest rates and a strong real won't do anything to get the economy rolling again and create jobs.'' 
 It might initially seem strange that the business community is calling on Mr. da Silva to loosen his fiscal and monetary discipline. 
 After all, when he took office last year, business leaders were relieved when Mr. da Silva, a former union leader noted for his fiery antimarket rhetoric, declared that he would not steer Brazil off the free-market path, even if it meant making tough economic decisions. 
 To prove his point, the government moved decisively to halt a worrying surge of inflation by raising its benchmark overnight interest rate to a dizzying 26.5 percent. 
 That succeeded in reining in prices, but it also threw the economy into reverse -- it shrank 0.2 percent last year, its worst performance in more than a decade -- and sent unemployment spiraling to 20 percent in Sao Paulo, the heart of the nation's economy. Also, the average income of Brazilian families fell 14 percent last year, government figures showed. 
 According to A.C. Nielsen, a consulting firm, nearly half of Brazilian families last year cut spending on basic food because of economic belt-tightening. Fecomercio, Sao Paulo's trade federation, says that more than a quarter of Sao Paulo residents are behind on credit card or loan payments. 
 Brazilians do not necessarily blame Mr. da Silva for that, arguing that the economy was already a mess before he took office, but they do remember his campaign pledges to ''change the economic model'' so as not to be a slave to the markets, as he claimed the previous government had been, and to create 10 million jobs. 
 Last year, even as the economy contracted, the president confidently predicted that Brazil would soon witness ''spectacular growth.'' 
 ''He's in a bit of a spot,'' said Douglas Smith, chief economist for the Americas at Standard Chartered in New York. ''It's been a bit over a year now, and the social indicators are not changing; if anything, they're worse.'' 
 The president is now under increasing pressure to get the economy growing again, and fast -- most likely by pressing the central bank to resume lowering its main interest rate as early as this week. 
 After slashing the overnight rate 10 percentage points, to 16.5 percent, in the second half of last year, the central bank has disappointed markets in the last two months by keeping the rate unchanged, citing fears of resurgent inflation. 
 The central bank president, Henrique de Campos Meirelles, insists that data from the last quarter of 2003 show Brazil growing at an annual rate of 6 percent. 
 That has prompted his critics to accuse Mr. Meirelles, who has been derided by some as an ''inflation fundamentalist,'' of being out of touch with the economy. 
 On Monday, the leader of the Liberal Party, a pro-business party in Mr. da Silva's coalition, publicly called for the resignations of Mr. Meirelles and his boss, Antonio Palocci Filho, the finance minister. 
 Speaking at a government ceremony, the Liberal leader, Valdemar Costa Neto, said there was widespread dissatisfaction with economic policy. 
 ''A banker, like Meirelles, only defends bankers,'' Mr. Costa Neto said. 
 According to Denise Neumann, a columnist at Valor Economico, a business daily, central bank officials ''are insisting the Brazilian economy is overheating, something which has no basis in reality.'' 
 Indeed, recent data show the economy could use a bit of stimulus. Last month, consumer prices fell in the Sao Paulo metropolitan region, despite contradictory signs that wholesale prices were rising. Then, in sharp contrast to Mr. Meirelles's glowing forecast, the government revised its growth projection for this year from 3.6 percent down to 3.4 percent. 
 All that has left Mr. da Silva open to friendly fire. After his own Workers' Party issued a statement demanding changes in economic policy, the president rallied to defend Mr. Palocci and Mr. Meirelles, who was brought in from FleetBoston to help dispel fears on Wall Street that Mr. da Silva could sink Brazil with irresponsible public spending. 
 Speaking at a meeting of ministers and business leaders in Brasilia, Mr. da Silva claimed that ''for the first time ever, we are stabilizing the economy without any economic inventions.'' 
 ''For interest rates to fall,'' he said, ''the country needs to have solid foundations and credibility.'' 
 But many in the business community feel the central bank's inflation target of 5.5 percent for this year is far too radical and is stifling recovery. 
 ''I'm not questioning inflation targeting, just the 5.5 percent target,'' said Horacio Lafer Piva, head of the influential Sao Paulo Federation of Industries. 
 At Metalfrio, which is the sort of company Mr. da Silva says he wants to see more of in Brazil -- Brazilian-owned and run and aggressive in export markets -- Mr. Lima says he could create 100 permanent new jobs tomorrow if the central bank eased policy even slightly. 
 A former investment banker who took over the company in January, Mr. Lima says he can see the government's quandary: it needs to ease policy enough to get the economy up and running, but remain tough on inflation to maintain its credibility on international markets. 
 ''The central bank's logic is the logic of the capital markets, not the logic of the productive sector, the real economy,'' he said. ''They really should be measuring the cost of controlling inflation.'' 
 The central bank could use other tools besides simply lowering interest rates, analysts say. 
 If, for example, the central bank started to increase its reserves by buying dollars on the open market rather than issuing fresh debt, that would drive the real down against the dollar and help lift exports. Some economists, however, say a weaker real would also spur inflation. 
 But for Mr. Lima, there is no doubt. 
 ''A slightly weaker real would mean more exports,'' he said. ''More exports, besides creating more jobs, would also reduce the debt-export ratio, improving the chances of Brazil's becoming investment grade in the near future, which is the central bank's dream.'' 
 Just a small shift in the exchange rate, he said, would allow Metalfrio to penetrate more global markets. The real now trades at 2.90 to the dollar.
 ''With the real at 2.80, I am competitive within Latin America,'' he said. ''At 2.90 I can compete in European markets, while at 3.10 to the dollar I would be competitive in any country in the world, including Asia.''

Gasoline Prices on Course To Reach Record Levels
Anyone who has not been shocked by the rapid climb in retail gasoline prices may want to brace for what is to come. The fear of disruptions in oil supplies and stricter environmental regulations are expected to push prices even higher this spring and summer.
 A federal agency said that gasoline supplies declined by 800,000 barrels last month, to 5 percent below the five-year running average. Earlier in the month, the agency warned that gasoline prices might rise to a nationwide average of $1.83 a gallon in April and $1.82 in May. Moreover, crude oil prices rose nearly 2 percent, to a 13-year high. [Page A1.]

HEADLINE: Consumer Prices Increase 0.3%

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Prices paid by consumers rose 0.3 percent in February, pushed higher by increasing costs of gasoline and medical care, the Labor Department reported yesterday. The gain matched the expectations of economists. 
 Core prices, which exclude energy and food, increased 0.2 percent last month, the same as in January. Economists had expected core prices to increase 0.1 percent in February. 
 Energy prices, which account for about a 14th of the index, rose 1.7 percent in February after jumping 4.7 percent a month earlier. Gasoline prices increased 2.5 percent. The costs of heating oil, electricity and natural gas all climbed in February.
 The rise in gasoline prices ''is not a danger signal of inflation; it's a danger signal to the discretionary spending power of consumers because it eats into income,'' said Elisabeth Denison, an economist at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein in New York.
 Workers' earnings adjusted for inflation fell 0.1 percent last month, the Labor Department said in a separate report. 
 The lack of new hiring restrains wages and other compensation that account for about two-thirds of a company's costs. The absence of accelerating employment costs makes it easier for businesses to hold the line on prices.
 The cost of medical care increased 0.6 percent last month, the biggest rise since October 2002. Housing costs, which include some energy costs and account for a third of the index, increased 0.2 percent. A category designed to track rental prices rose 0.2 percent. Air fares climbed 1.2 percent last month.
 Over all, inflation is ''quite low,'' Federal Reserve policy makers said Tuesday after keeping their benchmark interest rate at the lowest level since 1958.

HEADLINE: Tighter Gas Supply Is Expected to Send Prices Even Higher

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: HOUSTON, March 17 

 BODY:
Anyone who has not been shocked by the rapid climb in retail gasoline prices, to record levels in some cities, may want to prepare for what is to come. The fear of disruptions in oil supplies and stricter environmental regulations are expected to push prices at the gas pump even higher this spring and summer.
 The Energy Information Administration said Wednesday that gasoline supplies declined by 800,000 barrels last month, to 5 percent below the five-year running average. That lifted the price of next month's gasoline futures contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange nearly 3 percent. Crude oil increased nearly 2 percent, to a 13-year high.
 Earlier in the month, the agency, part of the federal Department of Energy, warned that gasoline prices might rise to a nationwide average of $1.83 a gallon in April, well past the previous record -- not adjusted for inflation -- of $1.747 a gallon in August 2003. Retail gasoline prices have already climbed more than 15 percent this year, to $1.72 a gallon on average nationwide. In California, the average is $2.10 a gallon, the energy agency said. 
 Gasoline prices in New York and Connecticut and several other Northeastern states might approach California levels in the weeks ahead, analysts at AAA, formerly the American Automobile Association, said. These states require the sale of low-emission fuels similar to those in California.
 Crude oil prices, the most important factor in the price of gasoline, are expected to remain high, perhaps to climb still higher, as concern grows over the possibility of disruptions in the oil industry of Venezuela, one of the largest suppliers to the United States. The price of oil has risen 20 percent since September, settling yesterday at $38.18. After adjusting for inflation, though, the Energy Department says that oil and gasoline prices today are well below what they were in the early 1980's, early in the eight-year war between Iran and Iraq, both then significant oil-producing nations.
 The price of gasoline, jet fuel and other petroleum products has risen fast enough and far enough to become a political issue. On Monday, Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, and Representative Mike Thompson, Democrat of California, called on the Bush administration to stop stockpiling crude oil in the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Doing so, they said, would ease demand for oil and help to moderate prices.
 Tension between the Venezuelan government of President Hugo Chavez and his domestic opponents has weighed on oil markets that were already under some strain from surging demand in China, the slow recovery of Iraqi exports in the violent aftermath of the Iraq war, and signs of renewed assertiveness in OPEC.
 ''Our cowboy mentality has failed us miserably in Venezuela,'' said Fadel Gheit, an energy industry analyst at Oppenheimer & Company in New York. ''We could have pumped up Chavez to be our back-alley oil reserve, but instead we squandered our attention and resources elsewhere. We're paying for having botched Venezuela.''
 Venezuela is a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which is pressing forward with production cuts announced in February at a meeting in Algiers and is scheduled to discuss further action on output levels when it meets at the end of this month in Vienna.
 The Venezuelans, among the largest OPEC producers, have been outspoken supporters of high prices. And Saudi Arabia, the largest oil producer and the force behind OPEC, has shaken markets by confirming in recent days that it has in fact made some of the cuts previously agreed to.
 If concern with global oil supplies were not enough, other important factors are contributing to higher gasoline prices. The most prominent may be the need for refineries to comply with environmental regulations aimed at cleaner-burning gasoline, which have been carried out in piecemeal fashion throughout the country in recent years.
 The rule changes have resulted in more than 20 gasoline formulations being introduced in cities and states, up from just regular and premium in many states 20 years ago, according to the National Association of Convenience Stores. The association's members sell about three-quarters of the nation's gasoline.
 New regulations in New York and Connecticut, for instance, will require ethanol to be used as a substitute this spring for methyl tertiary butyl ether, a substance referred to as M.T.B.E., that makes drinking water smell like turpentine. Spikes in prices may result because the two states import much of their gasoline from refineries in Europe, where supplies are said to be short on ethanol, an additive made from corn or sugar.
 Supplying custom-blended fuel to New York and Connecticut may also result in higher prices in neighboring states, since nearby refineries will have to focus on getting their mixtures right, limiting their capacity to produce other blends of gasoline. The gasoline transportation system is being stressed by the need to deliver many different types of gasoline by pipeline, truck, rail and barge.
 ''We're crossing our fingers that prices don't go higher,'' said Jeff Lenard, spokesman for the National Association of Convenience Stores. Mr. Lenard said these stores usually suffer from gasoline price increases because drivers have less money to spend on other items. Selling gasoline is also a relatively low-margin activity; in 2002, the last year for which statistics are available, gasoline sales accounted for 62 percent of total convenience store sales but just 40 percent of profit.
 There are other, more technical reasons gasoline prices might rise, including problems at refineries. Several refineries around the country have shut in recent weeks, including two catalytic cracking refineries in Texas operated by Valero Energy and Shell Oil. Technical problems were reported at several refineries in California, according to A.F. Alhajji, an energy economist at Ohio Northern University who monitors refineries.
 To be sure, the current concern over gasoline prices is coming after years when the United States has had some of the cheapest fuel costs in the industrial world -- largely because gasoline is not taxed as heavily in this country as it is in other nations. 
 But then, because gasoline is cheaper in the United States, rising crude oil prices or tight refinery capacity tend to produce relatively bigger price swings. Without adjusting for inflation, prices are at a record by some measurements, with the average nationwide price of gasoline climbing in recent days to $1.77 a gallon for all grades, a 26-cent rise so far this year, according to the Lundberg survey of 8,000 stations released over the weekend.
 And few economic trends point to relief in prices during the warmer weather of the months ahead, a period when drivers take longer road trips. The decline of the dollar against the euro has increased the domestic price of gasoline products originally set in euros, supplies that were processed in Europe.
 Similarly, the rising cost of European vacations for Americans may persuade many people to stay closer to home this summer and opt for vacations by car. That would increase domestic demand for gasoline even further, pushing prices still higher.
 The move in the Senate last week seeking to halt the purchase of oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve did cause crude oil prices to ease for several days. Other factors that could lead gasoline prices to decline, including commodity speculation or an easing of tensions in Venezuela, have yet to happen. 
 Yet few market analysts see higher energy prices affecting the behavior of drivers.
 ''Americans have created a lifestyle that requires regular driving,'' said Geoff Sundstrom, a spokesman for AAA. ''That means the drag on the economy could show up in other ways, like fewer purchases of other items while people go on buying gasoline.''

HEADLINE: Not Footloose but Fancy-Free, An Italian Comes Calling

BYLINE: By ERIC SYLVERS

DATELINE: MONTEBELLUNA, Italy 

 BODY:
Can you change the world with a pair of shoes? One Italian man -- who until 10 years ago spent his time making wine, not shoes -- seems to think so. In fact, he says he has already done it.
 Now that man, Mario Moretti Polegato, who founded the Italian shoemaker Geox in 1995, has a chance to prove to New Yorkers that the patented membrane on the soles of his shoes is indeed an innovation. On Tuesday, Geox officially opened a shop on Madison Avenue and 57th Street, and though the company has been selling its shoes at Nordstrom since 2002, the New York store is its first independent foray into the United States. 
 Geox's membrane has dozens of tiny openings that allow sweat to evaporate while blocking the entry of water. And that, Mr. Moretti Polegato said, makes Geox footwear more breathable than any other shoe. While that is a difficult claim to prove, Geox's rapid expansion has made it Italy's fastest-growing shoe company, vaulting it to the top ranks of the country's footwear makers. 
 The company, which made 27 million euros ($33 million) in 2003 on sales of 250 million euros, says it will sell 10 million pairs of shoes in 2004, more than twice the number of two years ago, and it forecasts 15 million pairs for 2005.
 Much of that growth is anticipated to come in the $47 billion United States shoe market, making the New York opening pivotal.
 About two billion pairs of shoes are sold each year in the United States, according to research done separately by the American Apparel and Footwear Association and Snapshots International.
 While Geox's expansion has been vigorous in its start-up years, success in the United States and China, which got its first Geox shop last year, offers the best chance for lasting growth. Geox, which sells its shoes in 55 countries, will open several more stores in the United States this year and will have 100 in China by the end of 2005.
 ''My shoes are such an important innovation that they can relaunch the Italian economy,'' Mr. Moretti Polegato said in a recent conversation at his office in this northeastern Italian town, which stands at the center of Italy's footwear industry. That is a hefty claim considering Geox's still relatively modest size and the fact that the bulk of the company's 5,000 employees work in factories in Romania and Slovakia.
 If Geox falters in the United States, it will not be for lack of self-assurance on the part of Mr. Moretti Polegato, 51, who seems convinced that his shoes have made the world a better place.
 He says the idea for Geox was born 11 years ago, when he was in Reno, Nev., for a wine convention. He wanted to take a walk in the mountains, but could not bear the heat on his feet, so he took a pair of scissors and made holes in the soles of his sneakers.
 ''My shoes give people a chance to revolutionize their lives,'' said Mr. Moretti Polegato, who wore a prototype of a jacket he designed that is supposed to allow sweat to evaporate through two special strips across the shoulders. 
 Another of his inventions on display in his office, which is lined with his portraits, is a double-layered glass bottle that keeps wine cold without refrigeration. ''It's a pity for humanity that it took so long to invent this shoe,'' he said.
 In an industry and a country where image is paramount, Geox bought and rebuilt a 200-year-old building on Via Montenapoleone, Milan's most famous shopping street and home to well-known fashion names like Valentino, Gucci, Armani, Versace and Prada. 
 This is all a big leap for Mr. Moretti Polegato, who worked in the family wine business until he founded Geox. The family still produces wine not far from his office.
 ''I didn't want to make shoes, I was a winemaker,'' said Mr. Moretti Polegato, Geox's only shareholder. ''But I had the fortune, or misfortune, to discover that footwear could be improved.''


CORRECTION-DATE: March 26, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An article in World Business on March 18 about the Italian shoemaker Geox referred incorrectly to its new store on Madison Avenue. It is not the company's first in this country; Geox operated what it called a concept store in King of Prussia, Pa., from September 2001 to last August.

HEADLINE: Hoping the Yen, if Not the Yuan, Will Show Muscle

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
Even as the Japanese government battles traders in the foreign exchange markets to keep the yen's exchange rate from rising against the dollar, a number of economists on this side of the Pacific are hoping that the markets will win. 
 With China showing no signs of bending to demands from Washington to let the yuan rise, economists say that an increase in the yen's value against the dollar could help spur American exports and reduce the yawning trade gap.
 ''It would be good for the United States trade balance,'' said Ernest H. Preeg, the top trade expert at the Manufacturers Alliance, a business research group in Arlington, Va. ''It would be good for U.S. jobs and the manufacturing industry.'' 
 A stronger yen tends to make Japanese exports to the United States more costly, and also gives American exporters a greater competitive edge in Japan. 
 Lately, however, American international economic diplomacy has focused instead on pressuring China to allow the yuan to revalue. Treasury Secretary John W. Snow even threatened to hold China's ''feet to the fire'' if it did not relax the yuan's decade-long peg of 8.28 to the dollar and let it float so that Chinese exports would not enjoy such a huge price advantage in the American market. 
 Yet even as Washington has been obsessed with China, the other Asian economic colossus -- Japan -- has been intervening even more intensely to try to keep a lid on the yen. Over the last year, Tokyo has purchased a net total of $180 billion in Treasury bonds, bringing its holdings to $577 billion, nearly four times China's total.
 ''China has been intervening for three or four years,'' Mr. Preeg said. ''Japan has been doing it for 10 or 15.''
 Ending Chinese and Japanese currency intervention carries a new set of risks. A rising yen could potentially snuff out Japan's economic recovery. Many in China fear that floating the yuan and eliminating capital controls could damage China's weak banking system. And if China and Japan were to stop intervening in currency markets, the United States government would need to find other buyers for billions of dollars worth of Treasury bonds.
 But American manufacturers would welcome a rise in any Asian currency. A steep decline in the dollar against the euro over the last year has done little to stimulate American exports, because of Europe's weak economic growth. 
 Even those who would like to see a stronger yen agree that the Bush administration's decision to concentrate on jawboning Beijing instead of Tokyo was not an unreasonable strategy. While the $66 billion bilateral trade deficit with Japan is the second biggest after the deficit with China, it has been relatively stable over the last few years, with both imports and exports falling from their 2000 highs. China's trade surplus with the United States, meanwhile, has almost doubled since 1999 and is now twice the size of Japan's.
 C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Finance and a longtime advocate of a cheaper dollar as the best approach to leveling global trade imbalances, said that China was in a pivotal position. He argues that if China were to revalue the yuan by, say, 25 percent, other big Asian nations -- like South Korea, Taiwan and even Japan -- would follow with currency shifts of their own. He predicted such a move would narrow America's $540 billion current account deficit, the broadest measure of its trade with the world, by some $50 billion. 
 But even if American industry's main focus is the rigid yuan, Beijing is not likely to accommodate change anytime soon. Given that, an appreciation of the yen would be a nice consolation prize. Mr. Bergsten calculated that a 10 percent increase in the value of the yen against the dollar could reduce the American current account deficit by $10 billion. 
 And to many economists and currency traders, the time for the yen to rise is now. As the Japanese economy emerges from its decade-long slump -- its overall economic output grew at a strong 6.4 percent annual pace in the fourth quarter last year -- the government in Tokyo might see less reason to hold down its currency by printing yen and buying dollars at a furious pace.
 ''The current performance of the Japanese economy suggests that we are getting closer to the point where continued intervention at the present scale will no longer meet the monetary policy needs of Japan,'' Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said in a speech to the Economic Club of New York this month. ''It must be presumed that the rate of accumulation of dollar assets by the Japanese government will have to slow at some point and eventually cease.'' 
 Indeed, while heavy intervention by the Bank of Japan managed to push the yen to a five-month low last week, when a dollar fetched 112 yen, the yen has strengthened in the last few days. At the close of the currency market yesterday, a dollar bought slightly more than 108 yen, near a three-year low mark of 105.
 Investors are betting the yen has a lot further to go on the upside. Jim O'Neill, head of global economic research at Goldman Sachs in London, has been recommending that traders short the dollar against the yen. ''If Japan stops intervening,'' he said, ''the yen would rise very sharply.''


CORRECTION-DATE: March 24, 2004

 CORRECTION:
The Market Place column in Business Day on Thursday, about economists who would welcome an increase in the yen's value against the dollar to spur American exports, misidentified the organization directed by C. Fred Bergsten, a longtime advocate of a cheaper dollar as the best approach to leveling global trade imbalances. It is the Institute for International Economics, not the Institute for International Finance.

HEADLINE: Saudi Economy Defies Terrorism Fears

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, March 11 

 BODY:
Saudi Arabia's economy is expected to deliver a second year of growth in 2004, helped by the highest sustained oil prices in more than two decades, though its performance is expected to fall short of the surprising 6 percent surge in output last year. 
 In 2003 the economy had its most robust year since 1981, and investors expecting additional expansion are fueling a rally in local markets. Saudi Arabia's leading stock gauge, the Tadawul all-shares index, which climbed 76 percent in 2003, is up an additional 11 percent so far this year, making it the best-performing market in the Middle East. 
 Such figures are welcome news for a government seeking relief after years of tepid economic activity and attacks last year on Western and Saudi targets by Islamist extremists. Evidence of attempts to crack down on such incidents is seen throughout the Saudi capital, a spread-out city of four million where gasoline sells for $1 a gallon and sidewalks are rarely frequented by pedestrians. 
 The international airport, for instance, is posted with fliers featuring photos of suspected terrorists and asking for anonymous tips on their whereabouts. The police have checkpoints along Riyadh's main thoroughfares, and the entrances to luxury hotels and residential compounds for Western expatriates are cordoned off by private security squads. [Reuters reported that at a checkpoint in Eastern Riyadh on Monday, security forces engaged in a shootout, killing a Yemeni man suspected of being a leader in Al Qaeda.]
 Even with the rebound in growth, there is considerable concern as to whether the economy will grow fast enough to alleviate social concerns like unemployment, which stands at 10 percent in government figures but is probably above 13 percent, according to private forecasts. Sustained growth of about 7 percent a year is needed to start reducing joblessness, said Nahed Taher, chief economist at National Commercial Bank in Jeddah. 
 ''Saudis have a lower skill set than many foreign workers,'' Ms. Taher said, referring to the estimated 6 million foreigners employed in Saudi Arabia, many of them from the Indian subcontinent, out of a total population of about 24 million. ''We need extensive training programs and a robust expansion of the private sector to create more opportunities.''
 Activity outside state-controlled companies accounts for only about 20 percent of the economy, pressuring the government to speed efforts to open some areas to foreign investment. Saudi Arabia is seeking to enter the World Trade Organization this year, though differences with the United States over issues like competition in telecommunications and intellectual property protection persist as obstacles. 
 Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil producer, also remains heavily dependent on oil sales. For instance, oil-related areas of the economy expanded 14 percent last year, while nonoil areas grew just 3.4 percent and other state-controlled sectors 1 percent, according to the Samba Financial Group, a banking organization based in Riyadh. 
 The heavy reliance on oil does little to combat joblessness, said Brad Bourland, chief economist at Samba, who said Saudi Arabia's economy had more in common with Exxon Mobil, the largest energy company in the United States, than with Wal-Mart, the largest retailer. Although Exxon Mobil and Wal-Mart both had revenues of roughly $250 billion last year, Exxon Mobil employs about 88,000, while Wal-Mart has more than 1.4 million employees. 
 ''Managing Saudi Arabia's oil industry in boom times essentially involves turning the spigot on and off,'' Mr. Bourland, a former State Department official who has lived in Riyadh for more than a decade, said in an interview here. ''Oil has done very little to keep up with the needs of the population.''
 The perceived urgency of creating jobs explains Saudi Arabia's recent aggressiveness in relation to oil prices. The nation needs an oil price of about $30 a barrel to continue meeting current budgetary obligations, suggesting that Saudi officials will continue lobbying for higher oil prices within OPEC, according to the Center for Global Energy Studies, a London research organization founded by a former Saudi oil minister. Private economists are hesitant to forecast specific growth rates for 2004, though few expect the economy to expand more than 2 to 3 percent despite high oil prices this year. 
 [Brent crude oil for May delivery climbed 40 cents on Wednesday, to $33.08 a barrel.] 
 Oil prices have risen more than $4 a barrel since the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries decided to cut production last month at a meeting in Algiers. The 11-country organization is planning to discuss the possibility of further production cuts at a meeting later this month in Vienna. 
 Because oil plays such a prominent role in the Saudi economy, government finances and spending are subject to volatile swings. The Saudi government posted a budget surplus of $12 billion in 2003, its first in three years, and is planning to invest about that amount in infrastructure projects this year in areas like transportation and utilities, Ms. Taher of National Commercial Bank said. 
 Beneath the optimistic spending projections, the economy appears to be slowly evolving away from its traditionally strong economic ties to the United States, several analysts said. In a symbolically significant move this month, Saudi Arabia signed gas exploration agreements with Chinese, Russian, Italian and Spanish companies. No American energy companies were awarded contracts.
 European investors also appear more willing than their American counterparts to take business risks like these in Saudi Arabia. With a new law allowing foreigners to invest in domestic capital markets expected to go into effect soon, two European banks, Deutsche Bank and HSBC of Britain, have applied for licenses to start investment banking operations in Riyadh. 
 Citigroup, meanwhile, long the most prominent foreign financial company in Saudi Arabia, has lowered its exposure to the country, reducing its stake in Samba to 20 percent from 48 percent and withdrawing from its management contract with the bank. The company also changed its name to Samba from Saudi American Bank. 
 Analysts attribute the decline in American investment to heightened political tension between Saudi Arabia and the United States and the end of large military and infrastructure contracts for American companies. Still, energy companies like Exxon Mobil and ChevronTexaco remain active in the nation's oil refining and petrochemicals industries.
 ''The hesitance of Americans is seen as something that's not quite merited by the actual dynamics of the Saudi economy,'' Nawaf Obaid, an independent consultant on security issues in Riyadh, said in an interview. ''Thanks to the budget surplus, the kingdom is able to spend more than expected on anti-terror efforts and is in a more favorable position to start privatizing certain areas like telecoms, the national airline and rail lines.''
 Still, strong growth and a robust stock market are not necessarily signs of increased political stability in Saudi Arabia, which has suffered several terrorist attacks and bombings by Islamic fundamentalists on Western enclaves and domestic targets in the last year. Much of the stock market's performance, for instance, is said to be fueled by Saudis repatriating cash from foreign accounts that have come under greater scrutiny from regulators investigating possible ties to terrorism.

HEADLINE: Learning Entrepreneurship The U.S. Way at M.I.T.

BYLINE: By MARCI ALBOHER NUSBAUM

 BODY:
During a crash course in American-style entrepreneurship, Marie-Louise Huber, a 26-year-old British biochemist, spotted business opportunity in an unlikely place: virginity.
 The virginity of fruit flies, to be precise. Ms. Huber says technology that one of her start-ups has developed can prevent newborns from copulating with their siblings, a natural occurrence in the insect world, and thereby speed laboratory research.
 ''When you breed fruit flies, you have to watch the females hatch, and as soon as they do you have to pick them out, separating the newborns and segregating them by gender so that they don't reproduce with their siblings,'' she said. Researchers want virginal flies so they can control all breeding. ''We have a technology for keeping fruit flies virginal which would save scientists an awful lot of time, money and boredom in the lab,'' she said. 
 This kind of thinking is exactly what the British government had in mind when it spent $118 million on a partnership of Cambridge University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The resulting entity, the Cambridge-M.I.T. Institute, offers three one-year graduate programs (with three additional ones to begin in October) with the aim to cultivate Britain's future technology entrepreneurs, create jobs and spur growth in the British technology sector.
 The inspiration for these programs, which began in 2002, was what might be called the M.I.T. touch, the phenomenal impact M.I.T. has had on the United States economy through the creation of technology-related companies by its alumni. According to a report by BankBoston in 1997, the roughly 4,000 companies founded by M.I.T. alumni and faculty members had created 1.1 million jobs and generated annual sales of $232 billion worldwide. And that was seven years ago.
 Importing entrepreneurship is tricky in a country that is not generally known for turning scientific discoveries into commercial products. ''Britain has no shortage of scientists of the highest quality,'' said Paul Klingenstein, the general partner of Aberdare Ventures, a venture capital firm in San Francisco that invests in new health care companies. ''Ironically, that has been the basis of many commercial enterprises here. But both capital and entrepreneurs gravitate to places where there is less resistance to new enterprise. That is why you see hubs of biotechnology innovation in places like Cambridge, Mass.; San Diego; and San Francisco.''
 And, increasingly in Cambridge, England. After working as a consultant at McKinsey & Company in London and then in charge of business development for Zingy Inc., a start-up in cellphone technology in New York, Ms. Huber decided she was destined to run a company for herself. Her responsibilities at Zingy were as varied as recording a voice mail message instructing customers how to change their ring tones to preparing presentations for potential investors.
 ''I loved the entrepreneur thing, but I don't really care about ring tones,'' she said. Then she heard about the Cambridge University-M.I.T. partnership, and specifically a master's degree in bioscience enterprises intended to train leaders in biopharmaceutical industries. Having studied biochemistry in college and wanting to start a business, she enrolled.
 ''She was the model student,'' said Dr. Frank Landsberger, a professor in the program who has spent many years working in biotechnology as a scientist, entrepreneur and investor.
 Ms. Huber completed her degree last spring with 14 other students and is now focused on getting two unrelated ventures off the ground. Cambridge Laboratories, which she started with four Cambridge doctoral students, is doing the research on fruit flies, which are commonly used as genetic models for scientific experiments. The other is a drug-discovery company based on research by a top New York City hospital, which she declined to identify. 
 In one of Dr. Landsberger's classes, students visit biotechnology companies in three countries -- Germany, the least entrepreneurial, in Dr. Landsberger's view; the United States, the most entrepreneurial; and Britain, which falls in the middle of the risk-taking spectrum -- to compare factors in business start-ups like the availability of venture capital, labor laws, government regulations and cultural attitudes.
 While Britain is making strides in building its biotechnology sector, it has plenty of room to grow, industry analysts say. For example, there were 194 venture-financing efforts that raised $3.4 billion in the United States last year in the biopharmaceutical sector, which includes drug- discovery, drug delivery, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, compared with 29 efforts that raised $263 million in Britain, according to Amity G. Wall, manager of research for the VentureOne Corporation in San Francisco.
 Cultural attitudes help explain the gap. ''Being an entrepreneur is risking falling on your face again and again,'' Dr. Landsberger said. ''In Continental Europe, failure is an indelible blot on one's career. In the U.S. it isn't. But England is starting to look more like the U.S. than Europe. Over the last decade or two, particularly among young people, a willingness to take risks in one's career has sharpened significantly.''
 Nora Szasz, 27, is another student at the Cambridge-M.I.T. Institute, known as C.M.I. ''We believe we have the technology to detect genetic disorders from a simple blood test that would replace amniocentesis,'' said Dr. Szasz, who has filed a patent application and is working with faculty members at Cambridge on the company. 
 Dr. Szasz, who was raised in Hungary by parents who own a biotechnology business, and who holds a doctorate in biological engineering from M.I.T., has taken part at C.M.I. in ''the analysts club,'' a class led by Professor Landsberger. He gives students free rein to take over the discussion, however, she says.
 ''We split into groups and do a report on a particular company, figuring out what it's about, whether it has a future and what we would change,'' she said. While such an approach is standard fare at American business schools, she says, it is uncommon for Cambridge. 
 On the other hand, the United States has its own drawbacks, in her view. ''M.I.T. was push, push, push to get assignments out the door,'' she said. ''I learned a lot, but I had no time except for what was on my plate at the moment.'' At Cambridge, by contrast, she said, she found ''the mental space to come up with the theory for my patent application.''
 When asked where she planned to start her company, her answer revealed one of Britain's biggest challenges in nurturing businesses. ''We will certainly kick it off here, because this is where the research and development is,'' she said. ''But the U.S. is our biggest target market.''
 Another lesson entrepreneurs-in-training have to learn about the biotechnology business is that the path to success is torturously long, requiring years of medical trials and successive rounds of fund-raising before even the hope of financial returns materializes. Anne-Marie Corner, president and chief executive of Biosyn Inc., a pharmaceutical company in Huntington Valley, Pa., said the time between a laboratory breakthrough and the introduction of a product is typically a decade or longer.
 Today, Biosyn has three AIDS prevention drugs in development and is enrolling thousands of women in large scale drug trials. ''We had one drug put into clinical trials, had some setbacks and then found a better drug,'' she said. Even so, ''we are not yet generating revenues, but we are considered a leader in the development of AIDS prevention drugs.'' 
 Ms. Huber says she is aware of the challenges. ''There is a huge amount of luck involved,'' she said. ''But if you miss the mark in drug discovery you can at least feel as if you put your life to some good purpose.''

HEADLINE: As job exports rise, some economists rethink the mathematics of free trade.

BYLINE: By Jeff Madrick. 
Jeff Madrick is the editor of Challenge Magazine, and he teaches at Cooper Union and New School University. His new book is ''Why Economies Grow,'' from Basic Books and the Century Foundation. E-mail: challenge@mesharpe.com.

 BODY:
FREE trade theory has a growing number of detractors, and one of their traditional concerns has understandably moved to center stage in this presidential election year. How much has the exporting of jobs to foreign nations contributed to the lack of jobs and the absence of wage growth in the current expansion at home? 
 The standard tenets of free trade theory strongly support the case for outsourcing. Generally, as business finds cheaper ways to make products, it reduces prices to consumers. And some businesses may not survive unless they can reduce labor costs. 
 In general, most economists believe that the ''consumer surplus'' that results from lower prices far outweighs the cost of lost jobs or lower wages. In other words, there are many more winners than losers. But recent research suggests that the magnitude of this advantage has been exaggerated. Also, the plight of the losers has clearly been sorely neglected in the economic literature. 
 And if sending jobs abroad turns from its current relative trickle to a fast-flowing stream, as it well might, the costs of job dislocation will be still higher.
 It is more than a little interesting how frequently past research understated the costs of jobs lost to free trade. A literature search published in a 2003 monograph by the economists Michael W. Klein, Scott Schuh and Robert K. Triest, called ''Job Creation, Job Destruction and International Competition'' (Upjohn Institute), provides a useful summary of this work. 
 A 1972 study by Stephen P. Magee, for example, toted up the welfare benefits of trade and set them against the costs of unemployment. The study purportedly showed that the benefits of hypothetically eliminating all trade restrictions outweighed the costs of unemployment induced by international competition by a ratio of 100 to 1. 
 It is hard to argue with such a lopsided benefit. But Mr. Klein, Mr. Schuh and Mr. Triest note that Mr. Magee neglected crucial costs of job dislocation, like the likelihood of displaced workers being paid a lower wage when they got new jobs. A 1980 study took into account more job dislocation costs, but found that benefits from a 50 percent cut in global tariffs still exceeded dislocation costs 20 to 1. Such results understandably led economists to neglect the costs of job dislocation. 
 The 1980 adjustments were still not nearly enough, however, Mr. Klein, Mr. Schuh and Mr. Triest argue. The main reason is that such early studies assumed that net changes in jobs -- the difference between those destroyed and those created -- were a good proxy for those who suffered from job dislocations. But in fact, many more jobs are destroyed and created in the United States than is immediately apparent. 
 For example, the authors find that in a large sample of manufacturers, 1.3 jobs per 100 were lost on balance each year from 1973 to 1993. But 10.2 jobs per 100 were destroyed, while 8.8 were created. (The discrepancy is a result of rounding.)
 Such a high rate of job destruction carries serious costs for workers, even when they eventually find new jobs. There are long periods of unemployment, retraining costs and costs of searching for a job. And the new jobs usually pay less than the old ones. In the meantime, skills are lost as well. 
 The authors estimate that if some of these costs of job dislocation were taken into account, the benefits of trade would outweigh the costs by a far smaller margin. For example, the ratio in the 1980 study would be reduced from 20 to 1 to only 2 to 1. 
 The authors remain advocates of free trade; a benefit of 2 to 1 is still hefty. But the findings suggest at the very least that a sizable number of workers are inevitably hurt by free trade. 
 Are protective tariffs an answer? One valuable contribution of Mr. Klein, Mr. Schuh and Mr. Triest is to show that job losses are rarely if ever uniform in an industry. As a consequence, tariffs may often be too broad a policy tool because they will protect companies that would not fire workers anyway. 
 Moreover, trade and the exporting of jobs are not the only sources of dislocation. Technological changes that may rapidly make existing products obsolete have the same consequences. Mr. Klein, a professor at Tufts University, says a better policy is to make unemployment insurance more generous. He adds that portability of corporate benefits like pensions and health insurance would also more directly address some costs of job dislocation. 
 Other economists are beginning to think about policies that efficiently compensate those who lose jobs for the costs of dislocation. Carl Davidson and Steven J. Matusz, in a monograph called ''International Trade and Labor Markets'' (Upjohn Institute), also argue that such policies must not sweep across industries and the labor force. They favor wage and employment subsidies over broader measures. 
 Such an analysis by no means tells us everything we have to know about free trade and outsourcing. On the one hand, the benefits of free trade are not necessarily limited to the consumer surplus. For example, to the extent that free trade expands markets, as even Adam Smith might have argued, it stimulates productivity growth because it makes possible enormous economies of scale in manufacturing, services and marketing, and enhances competition.
 On the other hand, keeping domestic wages high adds to the demand that can generate productivity gains. Moreover, the basic tenets of free trade assume that the economy is operating at full employment -- in other words, almost everyone who wants a job can find one. Not enough research has been done on the trade effects in an economy with persistent unemployment, which has characterized most of the last 30 years.
 What is entirely clear, however, is that the losers from free trade require more of the nation's attention. And their numbers are growing as trade and job migration expand.

HEADLINE: Taiwan Voters Weighing How Far to Push China

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: TAIPEI, Taiwan, March 17 

 BODY:
Chen Mingyi, a 25-year-old graduate student here, spent years preparing for annual national examinations in the hope of someday joining the government elite. 
 But when he sat for the three-day test last year he discovered that it had changed. The traditional catechism of Chinese history and culture, the pillar of academic standards since the Tang Dynasty, had instead become a touchstone for the most divisive issues in today's Taiwan.
 One question, for example, asked about Lai Ho, a local author whose writings only make sense to people who understand Taiwan's Minnan dialect. Mr. Chen, who as a schoolboy was fined for speaking Minnanese instead of standard Mandarin, flunked the exam. 
 The changes to the exam, and similar shifts toward an assertive Taiwan identity, are the backdrop for what has become the most competitive and, for both the United States and China, the riskiest presidential election in Taiwan's history. 
 An island of 23 million, Taiwan is a barnacle on the bow of the Chinese mainland, with its 1.3 billion people and surging economy. Yet Taiwan is the most delicate issue in relations between China, which claims sovereignty over Taiwan, and the United States, which has vowed to defend the vigorous democracy against any Chinese attack.
 The incumbent Taiwanese president, Chen Shui-bian, has cast the vote on Saturday as a choice between subjugation to Communist China and Taiwanese nationalism, which some see as a stepping stone to formal independence.
 The opposition, led by the Nationalist Party candidate, Lien Chan, favors a more conciliatory approach to the mainland, which the Nationalists under Chiang Kai-shek governed before losing the Chinese civil war and retreating to Taiwan in 1949. 
 The election hinges on how far Taiwan residents want to push the idea that they belong to a separate nation that has no more enduring connection to China than it does to Japan or even the Netherlands, its former colonial rulers.
 Taiwanese identity has been enjoying a tailwind of popular support in recent years, especially among native Taiwanese once suppressed by the Nationalists. It has been fanned by Mr. Chen, the leader of the Democratic Progressive Party, which once explicitly advocated independence. 
 But the Nationalists, who lost their 50-year grip on power to Mr. Chen in 2000, have staged a resurgence among those who think Mr. Chen has needlessly antagonized China and even risked the island's de facto independence. Mainland-born immigrants and their offspring, as well as the millions of Taiwanese who depend on booming trade across the Taiwan Strait, are among those saying they will support the Nationalists this time.
 So is Mr. Chen, the student, a native Taiwanese who is no relation to the president. He says the current government went too far when it changed the national exam to include questions on what some students considered aracana of Taiwan's indigenous history, like the one that asked them to name the original language of the Sinkan manuscript, a bible of one of Taiwan's aboriginal tribes.
 ''We grew up believing that our language is Mandarin and that our history is China's history,'' he said. ''Then some activists just erased China from our past. They want to tear us apart.'' 
 The island is sharply divided as the election approaches. Polls taken before a 10-day blackout period began last week show a dead heat, with about 90 percent of eligible voters saying they plan to cast a ballot. 
 While both parties have leveled accusations of corruption and promised different approaches to managing the economy, the dominant issue is Taiwan's sense of itself and how it should relate to China, which has 500 missiles pointed at the island. 
 A Nationalist victory would probably ease cross-strait tensions, lead to greater integration and perhaps prompt China to settle the sovereignty dispute quickly. Mr. Chen has said that he will be willing to negotiate with China if he wins a second term. But his supporters would almost certainly push him to take concrete steps -- including changing Taiwan's Constitution -- to firm up the island's independent political status, which would risk conflict.
 Most Taiwanese are ethnically Chinese. But numerous polls show that a majority have begun identifying themselves as Taiwanese rather than Chinese. 
 ''Particularly among the young and in the south, there has been a dramatic change,'' said Liao Dai-chi, a political expert at National Sun Yat-sen University in Kaohsiung. ''Any politician has to stand with 'Taiwan identity' to win election.''
 The use of Minnanese has soared, most notably on television, where it had been banned by the Nationalists. Mandarin-speaking Taiwanese must read subtitles to understand the sit-coms and talk shows with the highest ratings. Bookstores are full of history titles that explore Taiwan's indigenous past. Some pop singers have begun using Minnanese, even though that significantly limits the potential market for their music. 
 The issue of separateness also resonates among religious leaders. William Lo, the leader of Taiwan's Presbyterians, has told the church's 230,000 followers that Mr. Chen is the ''candidate who is closer to the Christian faith.'' Mr. Lo's family migrated from China nearly 300 years ago, but he says he has no more connection to China than descendants of Mayflower immigrants in America have to England.
 ''We are not pure Chinese blood because we have long since intermarried with aboriginal people,'' Mr. Lo says. ''Please do not put us in a Chinese prison.''
 China has only strengthened this kind of thinking. Its missile tests in 1996, intended to frighten Taiwanese voters ahead of an earlier presidential poll, created lasting resentment. The Chinese government also alienated Taiwanese last year when it lobbied aggressively to keep Taiwan out of the World Health Organization just as Taiwan was battling the SARS epidemic.
 Although the Nationalist Party promises to improve relations with China, Mr. Lien rarely mentions reunification. He campaigns using Minnanese and stresses his ethnic Taiwanese upbringing. But he has rested his election hopes -- and perhaps his party's survival -- on the idea that the political center is more moderate than Mr. Chen believes. 
 Mr. Lien's supporters say Mr. Chen miscalculated by pushing for a ''defensive referendum'' on cross-strait issues to be held along with the presidential poll. The idea angered the government in Beijing and cheered Mr. Chen's pro-independence supporters. But it also drew a rebuke from President Bush, who saw it as an unneeded provocation. That raised concerns that Mr. Chen had weakened relations with Taiwan's most important ally. 
 Mr. Chen's anti-Chinese populism is also seen by some as out of touch with economic reality. Last year, China overtook the United States and Japan as Taiwan's largest export market. Some 1.5 million Taiwanese now reside on the mainland.
 ''The Chen camp has ignored the interests of the middle class,'' said Lee Ching-an, a legislator for the People First Party, which backs the Nationalists. ''We are an island but we depend on the international economy.'' 
 In fact, the Nationalists are hoping that as many as 200,000 Taiwanese will jam charter flights back from the mainland to vote for them. (There are no absentee ballots.) The business community, divided in 2000, now leans toward the Nationalists. 
 The push to localize education may have also prompted a backlash. Some parents complain that their children must learn Minnanese along with Mandarin and English. Beyond the difficulty of learning three languages, the fact that Mandarin and Minnanese use overlapping characters with different pronunciations means that some students end up mastering neither. 
 Some students, like Mr. Chen, say the changes to the national exam were purely political and not based on anything he was taught. 
 ''It is not a question of whether we are Taiwanese,'' he said, adding, ''It's whether we have some standards for our society.''

HEADLINE: Georgia's President Risks Showing Warlord Who's Boss

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS

DATELINE: TBILISI, Georgia, March 17 

 BODY:
Two months after taking office, President Mikhail Saakashvili has touched off his first crisis by doing something that would seem quite unremarkable elsewhere: driving through his own territory.
 He was stopped Sunday by armed men at the border of the renegade province of Adzharia, touching off a series of events that left his government in a standoff with the warlord who runs the province, Aslan Abashidze.
 A confrontation was bound to come sooner or later, analysts say. But in attacking the problem directly by trying to cross the provincial border, Mr. Saakashvili has raised the possibility of armed conflict and put his young administration to a harsh test. 
 ''If he succeeds in this he is very strong,'' said Ghia Nodia, a leading political analyst. ''And if he is seen as a loser, this will of course become the beginning of a big problem for him also in Tbilisi.''
 The standoff is of keen interest to both Moscow and Washington, which have important interests in Georgia. It carries echoes of the proxy conflicts between the superpowers during the cold war.
 On Monday, Mr. Saakashvili instituted a blockade of Adzharia, and on Wednesday he sent Prime Minister Nino Burdzhanadze to meet with Mr. Abashidze in the Adzharian capital, Batumi. His office said he planned to travel there himself on Thursday.
 For his part, Mr. Abashidze declared a state of emergency, sent armed men into the streets and traveled to Moscow in hope of support.
 The situation is further complicated by the fact that the province is home to a Russian military base and has the backing of at least some Russian officials. Moscow's influence could be decisive in calming or sharpening the conflict, depending on its calculations of its own interests.
 The Kremlin has warned Georgia of ''grave and unpredictable consequences'' if Adzharia comes under attack. The mayor of Moscow, Yuri M. Luzhkov, flew to Batumi on Tuesday and said, ''We are brothers with Aslan Abashidze. I came to support him in a difficult situation.''
 Washington is watching closely because of its close relations with this former Soviet republic and its interest in a major oil pipeline that will open soon across Georgian territory. Mr. Saakashvili, 36, studied law in the United States and his government is receiving large-scale financial aid from Washington.
 A parliamentary election is scheduled for March 28, and some analysts see it as a deadline for dealing with Mr. Abashidze or proceeding with a vote that does not include a significant portion of the country.
 Mr. Saakashvili's supporters are sure to dominate the next Parliament. He remains highly popular since his ouster of former President Eduard A. Shevardnadze in a peaceful uprising in November.
 Success in Adzharia would strengthen Mr. Saakashvili's hand in addressing major problems of corruption and economic collapse in this nation of nearly five million people on the southern border of Russia.
 Since his election in late January, he has centralized power in the presidency through constitutional amendments that he calls a temporary measure to allow him to act more vigorously. With a series of showy televised arrests of prominent figures by armed men wearing masks, he has sent a signal that he is attacking corruption.
 His blockade of Adzharia took effect on Monday, closing its border with Turkey, cutting off its road and rail links with the rest of Georgia and barring ships from its Black Sea port at Batumi, a major transfer point for oil from Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan.
 Mr. Saakashvili also announced that the bank accounts of Adzharia's leaders would be frozen.
 ''Georgia is under real threat of disintegration and collapse,'' he said after announcing the blockade. He described Mr. Abashidze's actions as an armed revolt, but said he would try to resolve the confrontation in Adzharia peacefully.
 ''I am taking these steps to prove that Georgia is a state, it has a state border, it has airspace, it has its sovereignty and it has its budget, and this budget belongs to every citizen of Georgia, not to one of its clans,'' he said.
 Under Mr. Shevardnadze, the central government in Georgia was weakened and the country and its economy were fractured into fiefs and criminal enterprises. Mr. Abashidze was one of Mr. Shevardnadze's last supporters and had been allowed to enrich himself by keeping fees from oil shipments and withholding taxes from Tbilisi.
 ''This crisis is not just a confrontation between a region and the capital or between one politician and another,'' said Levan Ramishvili, director of the Liberty Institute, a private pro-democracy organization. ''It is a confrontation between two Georgias -- the Georgia of the past and the Georgia of the future.''
 During a testy telephone call on Sunday, Mr. Abashidze said Mr. Saakashvili demanded control of customs duties and of the Batumi port.
 ''He was just saying what he wanted and wouldn't listen,'' he told a regional television station. ''I reminded him several times that I am older than he is. He apologized but continued in the same vein.''
 Mr. Abashidze's time has passed, Mr. Saakashvili told reporters on Monday. ''No one likes to lose power, especially those from the old Soviet nomenklatura who have been around for too long. The whole idea of losing their position as a result of free polls and the will of the people makes them totally confused and they refuse to accept it.''

HEADLINE: No Longer On the Brink, American Air Is Still in Peril

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
American Airlines has pulled back from the brink. Now all it has to do is figure out how to stay on top of the brutally competitive airline industry.
 In the year since it skirted bankruptcy, American, the nation's largest airline, and a unit of AMR, has wrung $2 billion in concessions from its unions and surprised Wall Street by cutting its costs to 9.5 cents a seat-mile in the fourth quarter.
 But it is still a long way from profitability. While its operating costs are the lowest among the major airlines, they are still significantly above the 5.9 cents a seat-mile at JetBlue Airways, the industry leader. American is also saddled with a crushing $21 billion debt, as well as ballooning pension and health care costs that it has few options to address. 
 It must contend, meanwhile, with feuding unions that are loath to cut it any more slack, stiff competition for customers from low-fare airlines, and jet fuel prices that have soared 15 percent in the last 12 months to slightly more than $1 a gallon, including an increase of nearly 4 percent yesterday alone.
 On Tuesday, a UBS Warburg analyst reversed his full-year estimate for American from a profit of $1.05 a share to a loss of $1.20, citing the issues American faces.
 At least mere survival is not one of them.
 ''We're no longer talking about the b-word; we're talking about our future,'' American's chief executive, Gerard J. Arpey, said in a telephone interview. But while bankruptcy is no longer American's immediate problem, Mr. Arpey has no illusions about the difficulties that remain. 
 ''We recognize we dug ourselves a pretty big hole in the first years of this century,'' he said. The airline lost $1.5 billion last year, on top of $2.5 billion in 2002.
 Analysts say the most difficult immediate problem is the rising cost of jet fuel, which threatens to erase the tiny net income that many said they had expected the airline to earn this year. Yesterday, American contended it still expected to cut costs this year, despite the spike in fuel prices.
 To be sure, American is not alone in being hammered by fuel costs. Continental Airlines said last week that it did not expect to be profitable this year because of fuel prices, and Delta Air Lines raised its first-quarter loss estimate to $400 million last week for the same reason.
 American also faces trouble with its unions. While it has talked glowingly of the cooperation it has received in the last year from employees, some of the union leaders who persuaded pilots and flight attendants to accept deep wage cuts as an alternative to bankruptcy have departed.
 Further complicating the matter, the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association said last week that it would ask a federal labor board to conduct an election in its bid to unseat the Transport Workers Union, which represents American's 12,000 mechanics.
 The contest is bound to be lively, because the association's executive director, O.V. Delle-Femine, is a longstanding skeptic regarding airlines' pleas for cooperation. He has refused to sit on airline boards or sign confidentiality agreements that would give the union access to airlines' books.
 ''I'm not buying it,'' he said of American's bankruptcy threat last year. Were his union in place then, he would have told executives, ''go before the judge and prove it,'' Mr. Delle-Femine said.
 American contends it was ready to do just that. ''We were as close to filing as you can possibly be without filing,'' Mr. Arpey said. ''The papers were ready.''
 But American's chief financial officer, James A. Beer, says just as firmly that bankruptcy would have been worse for American than the measures it took to avoid Chapter 11.
 While its $2 billion a year in labor savings is less than the $2.56 billion a year that United Airlines, a subsidiary of UAL, achieved under bankruptcy protection, American was spared the upheaval and scrutiny that a filing would have caused, Mr. Beer said. He added that United, which filed in December 2002, is still under court protection.
 The concessions were not the only way American has attacked costs. Early last year, it began a top-to-bottom quest to overhaul operations, yielding $2 billion a year in savings in addition to the labor cuts.
 Its search has gone as deep as the air filters on its jet engines. Instead of paying its old supplier $31.70 a filter, American found another company offering the same filter for $1.25, and got the government's approval to install it.
 It has overhauled maintenance procedures at its repair base in Tulsa, Okla., where technicians no longer use drill bits once and toss them away. Its Boeing 777 long-range jets used to have two seating configurations -- one for flights to the Pacific, the other for the Atlantic. They now have just one. Most important, American is down to 7 aircraft types, from 14 during the 1990's. It will be at six types when it finishes retiring its Fokker F-100 jets this fall. That saves on the cost of training and spare parts.
 Such improvements are old hat to other industries, like automobiles and electronics. It is also the way things have always been done at the thrifty Southwest Airlines, the industry's low-fare leader. 
 But thrift was never essential to the big airlines, which covered costs by raising ticket prices. ''It wasn't because we were stupid,'' Mr. Arpey said. ''That kind of thinking just drove us in the 1980's and 1990's.''
 But that is no longer possible, in an era when low-fare airlines claim 25 percent of all domestic passengers. ''It's becoming increasingly clear that to survive in this industry, you have to be vigilant on costs,'' said Darin Lee, an economist with the LECG Corporation, a consulting firm based in Emeryville, Calif.
 Mr. Arpey, who is the son of an airline executive and a licensed pilot, is attacking his job with a drive that brings to mind the zeal of Robert Crandall, who was chief executive of the airline from 1986 until he retired in 1998. 
 But where Mr. Crandall stoked controversy, clashing with unions, and readily offering his blunt views on industry affairs, Mr. Arpey, 45, has been more low key.
 He has done few interviews and made only a handful of public appearances during his freshman year as chief executive at the airline, where he has spent his whole carrier, having joined in 1982 after earning his M.B.A. from the University of Texas. One appearance was on Christmas when he went to Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport to greet passengers and employees. Another occurred Jan. 27, when he testified before a commission investigating the September 2001 attacks.
 Mr. Arpey, who was in charge of flight operations when terrorists hijacked two American planes, called his predecessor as chief executive, Donald J. Carty, with the news. The pair monitored the events to their tragic conclusion.
 Rather than dwell on the past, Mr. Arpey prefers to focus on American's challenges now, including low-fare rivals that threaten American's turf. ''We will not retreat,'' he said. 
 In fact, more than two million people traveled American last year on fares of $150 or less, said Daniel P. Garton, American's executive vice president for marketing. And when JetBlue introduced transcontinental fares as low as $79 each way last year, American did it one better: it matched the fares, and offered ''fly two, get one free'' deals to frequent fliers from Boston and New York to California and Florida. Delta also matched the deal.
 At American, more than 150,000 people signed up, including 30,000 new members of its AAdvantage frequent-flier program, said Mr. Garton. That easily justified the free tickets American will award this fall to those who took two trips. ''It's icing on the cake,'' he said.
 Yet even as American enjoys such moments, Wall Street is dubious. Philip Baggaley, airline analyst for Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, says American will have to spend nearly $2 billion in cash this year to pay its debts and invest in facilities and equipment. That is almost as much as the $2.6 billion in unrestricted cash it had on hand at the end of 2003. American said yesterday that it expected to have $3 billion at the end of the first quarter.
 Mr. Baggaley, whose agency rates American's debt at B-, its second-lowest investment grade, said he was deeply concerned by American's pension and health care costs. They were not reduced in its negotiations with unions on concessions. The most effective way other major airlines have been able to attack those costs is to invalidate the obligations under bankruptcy protections, but that is the path American chose not to seek.
 Mr. Baggaley, who has known Mr. Arpey since the early 1990's, said he believed that the American chief executive's work was just beginning.
 ''Even though he's been in the organization a long time, he's approaching it with a fresh set of eyes,'' Mr. Baggaley said. ''He may indeed make some further changes. I don't think the story's over there yet.''

HEADLINE: As Prices Rise, Washington Debates Saving Oil or Selling It

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 17 

 BODY:
As the price of oil continues to climb, members of Congress and administration officials are giving new scrutiny to the government's main tool for preventing price shocks: the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. But they are reaching opposite conclusions.
 Last week the Senate, after hearing assertions that the reserve, by diverting oil from the market, was helping to drive up prices, voted to sell millions of barrels earmarked for the reserve and use the money for homeland security.
 On Monday, Senator Barbara Boxer and Representative Mike Thompson, both Democrats from California, wrote to Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham, asking the government to stop filling the reserve. In addition, the airline industry has been lobbying for an end to the reserve buildup. 
 A spokeswoman for Mr. Abraham, Jeanne Lopatto, said that the administration would retain the goal set by President Bush after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, to fill the reserve to its capacity, 700 million barrels, ''in a deliberate and cost-effective manner.''
 The concern over the diversion of oil into the reserve comes during an election year, when many lawmakers seem eager to find a way to reduce gasoline prices to keep them from becoming a campaign issue.
 Supporters of the Senate measure, which passed 52 to 43, said that putting oil into the reserve was pushing gasoline prices up 10 cents to 25 cents a gallon. 
 Oil industry experts and officials at the Energy Department said the flow into the reserve was less than 0.2 percent of world demand and would not affect prices much.
 The chief economist of the American Petroleum Institute, John C. Felmy, said that the estimate of 25 cents a gallon was ''far too extreme'' and that the real number was probably a penny a gallon or less.
 The measure's prospects are less certain in the House. Representative Joe L. Barton, the Texas Republican who is the chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, said in a statement after the Senate vote: ''While common sense dictates that the best time to purchase the oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is when oil prices are low, micromanagement of the reserve and price manipulation from the Senate floor are hardly desirable.''
 The reserve was established after the oil embargo of 1973-74 to provide replacement oil in case imports were disrupted again. It now holds about 648 million barrels of oil. While the reserve is at a record high, an increased demand for oil has made it less of a shield than it once was. The United States uses about 20 million barrels a day. Last year, 11.2 million barrels of that was imported, giving the reserve the equivalent of about 58 days of imports.
 By 2005, according to the Energy Department, imports will reach 11.9 million barrels a day. ''If you don't expand the reserve, you're going to fall behind,'' a senior Energy Department official said. 
 By contrast, in 1985 the reserve reached a peak of 118 days of imports, although the total inventory was less. Imports then were just over six million barrels a day.
 The government has a spotty record when it comes to putting away fuel for a rainy day; in 1994, it stopped buying oil. In 1996 and 1997, it even sold oil to finance maintenance of the reserve, which is kept in caverns along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. The reserve sold 28 million barrels from 1996 to 1997. The last emergency sale was in 1990-91, during the Persian Gulf war. 
 Since 1999, the government has been filling the reserve with ''royalty oil,'' which it receives from oil companies as payment for wells on federal property.
 An earlier system where the companies paid cash was prone to disputes over the worth of the oil. By accepting payment in kind, the government established a flow of more than 100,000 barrels a day. But the Senate voted last week to begin selling that oil, which would eventually raise about $1.7 billion for homeland security needs. 
 In debate last week, Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat, said that halting additions to the reserve would ''improve our overall energy security by moving us away from the brink of a crisis in supply.'' 
 Senator Levin and Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, were co-sponsors of the measure on selling the oil.
 Senator Pete V. Domenici, a New Mexico Republican, speaking against the measure, said there would be no reason to stop at homeland security.
 ''If we could just sell all the oil in S.P.R.,'' he said, ''we could take care of every program in this government. My colleagues could all go home.'' He added: ''We could just spread it everywhere. That is much the same as saying, Quit buying it, and what you were going to buy, spend on other things.''

HEADLINE: Deficit Pigeons

 BODY:
Not all money grows on trees -- only tax-cut dollars do. That's the message being delivered by the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives this week. The House is vowing to clamp down on those mushrooming federal deficits. It is considering new spending caps and requirements that any increase in spending be offset by cuts elsewhere in the budget. What makes the move more comical than serious is that House leaders opposed extending the same principle to the revenue side of the government's ledger. In other words, the cost of President Bush's tax cuts needn't be offset by anything. 
 This approach to budgeting is tempting, we realize, but do not try this at home. Imagine subjecting yourself to a household budget that monitored only your family's spending, without taking into account any fluctuations in your income. You could cut back on your work hours without allowing any impact on your lifestyle -- assuming that you, too, could run huge deficits.
 President Bush's tax cuts have recklessly shrunk the federal government's revenues in a time of war. Federal tax receipts now amount to an estimated 15.7 percent share of national output, the lowest share since 1950. That's down from 20.9 percent in 2000. Meanwhile, federal spending continues to amount to about 20 percent of national output. Most of that goes to defense and fixed expenses, like debt payments and entitlements. There isn't much discretionary spending to cut.
 Mounting deficits, a threat to the nation's long-term economic health, are the natural outgrowth of these stark percentages. The White House claims that the economic slowdown is primarily responsible for these deficits are wearing thin. Indeed, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office just issued a report that attributes only 6 percent of this year's $500 billion deficit to a sluggish economy. Far more dominant as factors behind the red ink are the costs of the president's progressively deeper tax cuts, weighted for the affluent, and the Iraq war. 
 Republicans are starting to worry that their lax stewardship of the nation's finances could prove a liability this November. Hence the sudden protestations of deficit hawkishness on Capitol Hill.
 Last week, Senate Democrats joined with four Republicans to pass a genuine pay-as-you-go budgetary measure that would apply to both spending and tax cuts. It is modeled after the successful 1990's pay-as-you-go bill that Alan Greenspan and others credit with helping to tame federal deficits back then. It would require a 60-vote majority to pass any tax cuts or spending increases not paid for by offsetting additional revenue or spending cuts.
 The Bush administration and House leaders know full well that such a measure would kill off any hope of extending their tax cuts into perpetuity. So they mobilized to defeat the attempt by some moderate House Republicans to also embrace a true pay-as-you-go measure. Instead, the House Budget Committee passed its Potemkin version of fiscal hawkishness yesterday, which would apply only to spending and not to tax cuts. Call it pray-as-you-go discipline. The entire chamber is expected to follow suit, setting up a confrontation with the Senate.
 It will largely be up to four moderate Republican senators -- Lincoln Chafee, John McCain, Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe -- to decide whether they want to fight an uphill battle against their president to put a stop to what his father once called voodoo economics.

HEADLINE: Losing Time on North Korea

 BODY:
The North Korean nuclear threat is not the kind of problem that grows easier to solve with time. If time is on anyone's side, it is on that of Pyongyang's aspiring bomb makers. The country continues to reject the restraints of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, keeping international inspectors away from its known plutonium reprocessing unit and suspected uranium enrichment plants, while defiantly proclaiming progress toward building a bomb. Yet the Bush administration appears oddly content to let the situation drift forward, at least through this year's presidential elections. Such a lack of urgency could prove costly to America's future security. 
 Granted, there are no attractive diplomatic or military options available and no guarantees that North Korea is seriously interested in a peaceful solution. Still, considering what Pyongyang might do with a fully developed nuclear arsenal -- like blackmailing its neighbors or selling bomb ingredients to anyone with enough cash -- Washington should be energetically probing for diplomatic opportunities. So far, it has merely been going through the motions.
 Midlevel American officials have now sat through two rounds of six-nation talks on North Korea in Beijing, and despite the lack of visible results, have dutifully pronounced them useful. Yet all parties understand that no serious progress can be expected in these talks unless Washington steps forward and spells out the concrete diplomatic and economic steps it would take if the North agreed to verifiably dismantle all its nuclear programs. 
 President Bush once rejected doing so on principle, saying it would be wrong to reward North Korea for giving up nuclear weapons programs it had repeatedly promised not to undertake in the first place. Since then, the White House has adopted a more pragmatic view. It has broadly indicated its willingness to give North Korea security guarantees, improved relations and economic help once the North follows Libya's example and abandons all of its nuclear programs -- military and civilian, plutonium-based and uranium-based. What it cannot bring itself to do is negotiate specific, simultaneous steps to achieve that goal. It insists, unrealistically, that North Korea commit itself to full disarmament before America offers anything concrete in return.
 The administration seems intent on using the talks to convince the four other participants -- South Korea, Japan, China and Russia -- that North Korea is not interested in a diplomatic solution at all. Some of those countries have begun to show increasing impatience with North Korea's belligerent language and unwillingness to put all of its cards on the table. But none of these countries, all neighbors of North Korea, are prepared to give up on diplomacy, in part because they all have much too much to lose from any military confrontation. 
 Left to themselves, America's partners in the six-party negotiations would talk forever, all the while claiming that diplomatic progress was being made in minute increments. North Korea is also happy to let the talks drag on, as it proceeds unhindered with its nuclear weapons development. The country in a hurry for a diplomatic solution ought to be the United States.

HEADLINE: Panel Vote Draws Battle Lines for Pay-as-You-Go Tax Cuts

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 17 

 BODY:
Setting up a potential showdown with the Senate, Republicans on the House Budget Committee rejected legislation on Wednesday that could have imperiled the extension of the tax cuts that are a centerpiece of President Bush's economic program.
 The committee, in a 24-to-18 party-line vote, turned down a Democratic amendment that would have blocked future tax cuts unless they were paid for with money from spending cuts or increases in other taxes. 
 In a nod to conservative members of the panel concerned about what they call runaway spending, the committee voted to adopt new rules forcing lawmakers who want to increase spending for entitlement programs like Medicare to find other spending cuts of the same amount. It also voted to institute tough five-year caps on spending for discretionary programs, which essentially cover everything outside of Social Security and other entitlement programs. One outside liberal group, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said the caps would lead to the lowest level of spending on domestic discretionary programs, as a percentage of the economy, since 1963. 
 A handful of moderate Republicans signaled Wednesday that they might break with their party leaders on whether to make it tougher to enact tax cuts. But assuming the full House goes along with the committee, the vote on Wednesday sets up a clash with the Senate about the future of Mr. Bush's tax cuts. 
 Last week, the Senate voted to require that any new tax cuts over the next five years win at least 60 votes in the 100-member chamber, unless the lost revenue could be made up elsewhere. With the support of four moderate Republicans, the vote effectively gave Democrats a veto over efforts to extend the tax cuts; many lawmakers say it is very unlikely with a $478 billion deficit and continued operations in Iraq and Afghanistan that money could be found to offset new tax reductions.
 Acknowledging that applying so-called pay-as-you-go rules to taxes would complicate efforts to make the tax cuts permanent, White House officials have been lobbying hard against the legislation. The House speaker, J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, has signaled that House leaders intend to kill the provision when House and Senate budget writers meet to reconcile differences in their proposals. Republicans say it would be foolish to erect barriers to extending tax cuts that have spurred economic growth; Democrats say the cuts are the main reason the nation faces its largest-ever deficit in dollar terms.
 On Wednesday night, the committee approved and sent to the House a $2.4 trillion budget resolution.
 Despite the committee vote, some moderate House Republicans said in interviews that they might join with Democrats to support tighter restrictions on future tax cuts.
 ''I would certainly lean to vote for it,'' said Representative Michael N. Castle, a Delaware Republican who is president of the Republican Main Street Partnership, a group of more than 60 moderate Republicans in the House and Senate. ''I still need to be persuaded that the tax cuts should be made permanent.''
 Representative Sherwood Boehlert, Republican of New York, said: ''I like the concept. The deficit is emerging as the issue of the year, and we better get serious about addressing it.''
 Another moderate Republican from New York, Representative Amo Houghton, said he would consider voting for the provision rejected in the committee on Wednesday. ''Everything is on the table,'' Mr. Houghton said. ''We ought to have some sort of boundaries.''
 But the House Budget Committee chairman, Jim Nussle of Iowa, said that efforts to make tax cuts subject to pay-as-you-go rules would not succeed in the House. ''It's really a nonstarter,'' he said.
 Mark Kirk, a Republican House member from Illinois, said a compromise could be struck in conference committee to subject tax cuts to pay-as-you-go rules but exempt those whose extensions are called for in this year's budget resolution. Those include tax cuts that expire this year but have bipartisan support: eliminating the so-called marriage penalty, expanding the 10 percent tax bracket and keeping the child tax credit at $1,000.

HEADLINE: Bush Glad to Be in the Campaign Fray and Not Above It

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER; Jim Rutenberg contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 17 

 BODY:
A rule of Washington is that presidents should not descend too early into the swamp of a political campaign.
 President Bush, for one, thinks that is nonsense.
 It was the president's decision, White House and campaign officials said in interviews this week, to transform himself into an out-and-out political candidate a full eight months before the election. It was the president's decision, they said, to directly attack Senator John Kerry the day after Super Tuesday, when Mr. Kerry became the presumptive Democratic nominee. 
 And it was the president's decision to start an early round of negative ads against Mr. Kerry, who with the other Democratic candidates had been lobbing verbal explosives at Mr. Bush from the first of the year.
 ''He said since they were blasting him for two months, they had to use 'comparative ads,' '' said Representative Peter T. King, Republican of New York, who spent a day last week in Long Island with Mr. Bush. ''And he smiled when he said that. He said that would get the debate started.''
 So far, Republicans insist that the attacks are working and cite as evidence opinion polls in the last two weeks that show Mr. Bush pulling slightly ahead of Mr. Kerry. Democrats counter that the attacks are highly risky and could cause a backlash against Mr. Bush, diminishing his stature as president. 
 ''They've got the president of the United States looking like he's a county chairman somewhere,'' said Bill Carrick, a Democratic strategist. ''It looks very hot.''
 Mr. Bush has no plans to relent. ''People are viewing him already as a candidate, so why should we muzzle one of our most effective voices in framing the debate?'' said a senior White House official who asked not to be named because he did not want to be pestered by reporters.
 Nonetheless, the White House official said, the ''heavy lift'' of the most negative campaigning would be done by surrogates like Vice President Dick Cheney, who strongly attacked Mr. Kerry on Wednedsay in a speech at the Reagan library in California. Mr. Cheney said that if it had been up to Mr. Kerry, Saddam Hussein would be in power in Iraq and in control of Kuwait. ''It is not an impressive record for someone who aspires to become commander in chief in this time of testing for our country,'' Mr. Cheney said.
 The president has so far been insistent, the official said, that the barbs he aims at Mr. Kerry are softened with humor. For example, after Mr. Bush decided he would directly attack Mr. Kerry the day after Mr. Kerry swept 9 of 10 states on Super Tuesday, he instructed his speechwriters to come up with a good line but ''be funny about it,'' the White House official said.
 The line -- Mr. Kerry has ''been in Washington long enough to take both sides on just about every issue'' -- got whoops from Republican donors in Los Angeles on March 3.
 Republicans say that Mr. Bush has jumped into the negative waters early because of the lessons he learned from his father, who hung back and failed in 1992, and because of his competitive personality. 
 ''He likes campaigning, and he likes combat,'' said Charles Black, a consultant to Mr. Bush's campaign. ''He doesn't like sitting back and taking a lot of punches from anybody. It took a lot of discipline the last few months for him to do that. There were times when he wished he could respond, but you can't go fight nine people at once.''
 Mr. Bush, by all accounts, is relieved that he has finally engaged his opponent, and is happily making day-to-day campaign decisions as well as setting long-term strategy about defining Mr. Kerry. Republicans who have spoken to the president recently say he thinks Mr. Kerry's privileged lifestyle will eventually hurt him, even though Mr. Bush grew up in a family of great wealth and far greater political connections.
 Mr. King, who watched Mr. Bush talk to firefighters at a groundbreaking for a 9/11 memorial in Long Island last week, said he told the president on Air Force One on the way back to Washington, ''I would have a hard time seeing Kerry comfortable with these guys.''
 ''And he said,'' Mr. King recounted, '' 'I didn't exactly grow up in deprived surroundings.' But then he said he thought he has much more in common with them than Kerry, and that it would come out in the course of the campaign.''
 Mr. King added that Mr. Bush told him that Mr. Kerry had won the primaries by building on ''the hatred for me in the Democratic base.'' Mr. King said that Mr. Bush made the assessment without rancor and that the president thought the anger among Democrats would not be enough to propel Mr. Kerry to victory in a general election.
 Mr. Bush also said, Mr. King recounted, that he had not expected the fiercely negative reaction to the use of images of the devastated World Trade Center in his first campaign commercials. Even so, Mr. King said, ''he said it may end up helping because it's bringing the debate back to Sept. 11 more quickly than we could have anticipated.''
 But Democrats said the criticism underscored the dangers for Mr. Bush in taking on Mr. Kerry so soon.
 ''He really opens himself up on every front as he chooses to go negative,'' said Peter D. Hart, a Democratic pollster. ''When he's president, he gets a greater latitude, but now he's just another politician. And the question is not whether it's working for this month -- what counts is November.
 Democrats said Mr. Bush's attacks had energized opponents like the Media Fund, headed by Harold M. Ickes, a former deputy chief of staff to Bill Clinton. On Wednesday the group began showing an ad blaming Mr. Bush for job losses to other nations. An announcer says, ''During the past three years it's true that George W. Bush has created more jobs,'' adding, ''unfortunately they were created in places like China.''
 MoveOn.org Voter Fund, a liberal advocacy group meanwhile, introduced a television advertisement calling on Congress to censure the president for the lead-up to the Iraq war. In that commercial a Bush impersonator is heard to make the case for war as follows: ''My fellow Americans, we have no evidence that Iraq has stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction. No connection to 9/11. No nuclear capability. They pose no imminent threat to us.'' An announcer concludes, ''If he said that, would we have gone to war, spending $125 billion and losing more than 500 American lives?'' 
 Mr. Bush's advisers said that in the midst of the negative build-up, they were keeping a close eye on tone, and making sure that the president, in their view, did not go overboard. Mr. Bush himself, they said, was trying out approaches in his speeches across the country.
 ''Right now he's measuring the response from crowds on different lines and different things,'' the White House official said. Two weeks ago in California, the official said, Mr. Bush tried out the term ''economic isolationism'' to describe what he viewed as Mr. Kerry's approach to trade.
 ''He really liked the response he got,'' the official said. ''So he went back to Texas that night, and I talked to him over the weekend, and he said, 'I want to push this point out.' '' 
 The next week, ''economic isolationism'' became the theme of a speech on trade that Mr. Bush delivered in Cleveland, where he attacked ''people who doubt our ability to compete.''
 The president-candidate did not mention what ''people'' he had in mind, but nobody had to ask.

HEADLINE: As Quickly as Overnight, a Democratic Star Is Born

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

DATELINE: CHICAGO, March 17 

 BODY:
In his quest for the Democratic nomination for the United States Senate, Barack Obama was, by many measures, supposed to lose. One opponent was a multimillionaire pouring his own cash into the race. Another was a loyal statewide official who was expected to bring the party's ward troops out in force on election day.
 But Mr. Obama, a state senator from Chicago, awoke Wednesday to a deluge of national attention, a result of his overwhelming victory the night before by margins unforeseen by any polls or guesses. John Kerry called. So did Senator Tom Daschle and Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic national chairman. And the phone kept ringing. 
 Overnight, Mr. Obama, a former civil rights lawyer, has become a treasured commodity in the Democratic Party nationally, in part because Democrats see the Illinois seat as one they may easily snatch back from Republicans in November, and in part because Mr. Obama would be the only black member of the Senate.
 ''I think it's fair to say that the conventional wisdom was we could not win,'' Mr. Obama told a ballroom packed with his supporters late Tuesday night. ''We didn't have enough money. We didn't have enough organization. There was no way that a skinny guy from the South Side with a funny name like Barack Obama could ever win a statewide race.
 ''Sixteen months later we are here, and Democrats from all across Illinois -- suburbs, city, downstate, upstate, black, white, Hispanic, Asian -- have declared: Yes, we can! Yes, we can! Yes, we can!''
 If Mr. Obama had drawn little notice outside of his home state, that began changing within hours of the polls' closing. ''This is like being shot from a cannon, in terms of the demands on your time,'' said David Axelrod, a political consultant for the Obama campaign.
 Party leaders began speculating where Mr. Obama, a Harvard-educated, polished orator, might fit into a national political scene if he defeated Jack Ryan, the Republican nominee for the seat that a fellow Republican, Peter G. Fitzgerald, had decided to give up. And political experts mulled history: there have been only two black members of the Senate since Reconstruction, including one from Illinois, Carol Moseley Braun.
 ''I think Barack Obama is one of the most interesting and capable individuals that is running this time, if not in any election,'' Senator Jon Corzine of New Jersey, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said Wednesday. ''Frankly, he will be one of the easier candidates to raise resources for.''
 But if Mr. Obama, 42, was feeling the heat of rising national expectations, he did not show it as he flew around the state Wednesday afternoon to thank voters in places like Springfield, Quincy and Marion. He said he saw matters of race as less important to his primary victory than the issues he had talked about: a mostly liberal collection of ideas about health care, education and the economy, all sharply critical of the Bush administration.
 ''This election probably signals the maturing of not just black voters but Illinois voters across the board,'' Mr. Obama said in a telephone interview in between his downstate stops. People showed, he said, that they ''are more interested in the message than the color of the messenger.'' 
 ''I have an unusual name and an exotic background, but my values are essentially American values,'' Mr. Obama said. ''I'm rooted in the African-American community, but I'm not limited by it. I think this election shows that.''
 Mr. Obama (pronounced oh-BAH-mah), whose father was Kenyan and whose mother was a white American, worked hard during the primary campaign to pursue the constituencies of Harold Washington, Chicago's first black mayor, and of Paul Simon, a white senator from downstate known for his independent views. So he had been expected to do well among black voters and liberal whites.
 The results showed that he had succeeded at that, but also that he had won unexpected support from centrist white Chicagoans and white suburbanites in the counties that surround Chicago.
 In a field of seven, Mr. Obama received more than 52 percent of the vote statewide while his closest competitor, State Comptroller Dan Hynes, whose family has long held power within Chicago's Democratic Party, had less than 24 percent. Mr. Obama even won in Mr. Hynes's predominantly white home ward on Chicago's North Side.
 As recently as three weeks ago, polls showed both Mr. Obama and Mr. Hynes trailing Blair Hull, who spent $29 million of his own money on the race. But Mr. Hull's campaign suddenly imploded over his former wife's accusations that he had behaved violently toward her.
 In the end, Mr. Hull received just 10 percent of the vote. But many analysts had presumed that his onetime supporters would vote for Mr. Hynes, who like Mr. Hull is white. They turned instead to Mr. Obama.
 Mr. Obama grew up in Hawaii, raised mainly by his mother and his grandparents. He graduated from Columbia and Harvard Law, and was the first African-American president of The Harvard Law Review. 
 As a young adult, he moved to Chicago, where he worked as a community organizer in struggling neighborhoods, then as a civil rights lawyer in cases involving voting rights and employment discrimination. He and his wife, Michelle, have two young girls and live in Hyde Park, a South Side neighborhood. He lectures at the University of Chicago Law School.
 In the State Senate, Mr. Obama has pressed to overhaul the Illinois death penalty system, to add more health care services for the poor, to expand early childhood education programs, to improve the state's system of juvenile justice and to create a state earned-income tax credit.
 In 2000, Mr. Obama ran for the United States House, facing a Democratic incumbent, Representative Bobby L. Rush. Mr. Rush won the primary, and in this year's race supported Mr. Hull -- a sign, some here thought, that there would be a rift among black leadership in Chicago.
 On Wednesday, all of Mr. Obama's opponents of the day before met with him for breakfast. So did the Democratic leaders statewide. Even Mr. Rush was there, Mr. Obama said. From here on, the State Senate's president, Emil Jones Jr., maintained after the meeting, ''this will be one unified force.''

HEADLINE: Powell Pledges Support to Afghans Amid Talk of Election Delay

BYLINE: By AMY WALDMAN

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan, March 17 

 BODY:
President Hamid Karzai said Wednesday that national elections planned for June could be held as late as August, and that even this goal depended on the success of a major voter registration push to be held in May. 
 Voter registration has been hampered by rugged terrain, poor security, bureaucracy and cultural constraints on women's participation in public life. So far about 1.5 million of an estimated 10 million eligible voters have been registered. 
 ''By the end of May we should be able to register eight million people,'' Mr. Karzai said. ''If that is done on time by the United Nations, the Afghan government is keen to have elections in June, July or in August -- depending on the preparations for elections.'' 
 Mr. Karzai's comments came during the first visit by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell to Kabul in more than two years. Mr. Powell said before he departed for Pakistan Wednesday afternoon that delaying the elections by a month or two did not make a ''significant difference as long as it's done well, as long as it seems fair, honest and objective.'' 
 The Bush administration is eager for elections to be held this summer. Mr. Powell's first stop Wednesday morning was a voter registration site at the Mariam Lyceum school, where he met with women registering to vote. 
 He said he would carry the message to President Bush that while the registration process was going well, with some 8,000 people a day signing up to vote, ''we have to speed it up.'' 
 Mr. Powell also indicated that the United States would not offer any major new aid to Afghanistan at an international donors' conference to be held in two weeks in Berlin, but would formally donate the $1 billion already appropriated as a supplement to the fiscal year 2004 budget. 
 This brought aid to Afghanistan in fiscal year 2004 to nearly $2.2 billion -- a significant amount, Mr. Powell said, that ''shows the American people are committed and dedicated to reconstruction.''The additional money was part of an effort to ''accelerate success'' in a country still struggling after two decades of war. Most of it is to be spent by the end of the year, according to officials here. 
 But for fiscal year 2005, the Bush administration has requested $1.2 billion in aid for Afghanistan. Of that, about $400 million will go to economic and social reconstruction, while the rest will go to infrastructure and security, with money for the Afghan National Army and the police. 
 In February, Mr. Powell told a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the needs of Afghanistan were so great that it could take ''two, three, four, five times the amount that the international community has provided.''
 Mr. Powell said repeatedly Wednesday, in response to Afghans' anxious questions, that the United States would not abandon Afghanistan. ''The American people are committed, Congress is committed, above all President Bush is as committed as he has been since the very first day we started and you can be sure of that,'' he said. 
 Mr. Powell also said Wednesday that a battle Tuesday between Pakistani forces and militants in South Waziristan on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border suggested that Pakistan had increased its efforts to pursue Taliban and Qaeda militants who had taken shelter there. 
 Mr. Powell did not directly answer a question about whether United States troops in Afghanistan engaged in ''hot pursuit'' of suspected enemy combatants would be permitted to cross the border into Pakistan.

HEADLINE: A Bitter Chavez Castigates U.S., Saying It Misjudges Him

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS; Juan Forero contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, March 15 

 BODY:
Hugo Chavez, the president of Venezuela, feels grossly misunderstood.
 Mr. Chavez, who has been fending off a recall referendum, admits he is baffled that so many people -- particularly the Bush administration -- seem to dislike him so intensely. Nearly a decade after he left prison, where he was sent for plotting a coup, followed by elections in 1998 that brought him to the presidency and a rewriting of the Constitution, he does not grasp why he has not won a democrat's credentials.
 Why, he asks, is the United States, the neighbor and customer that is the cultural touchstone for so many of his people, seeking to drive him from power? He would like to know why the Bush administration is sowing rumors that he is, take your pick: encouraging insurrection in Bolivia, supporting rebels in Colombia, colluding with Fidel Castro and, most distressingly, plotting class warfare and disenfranchising the middle and upper classes of his country. 
 ''Unfortunately, there has been no way of talking with this administration,'' he said in an interview Saturday at the presidential palace. ''They don't respect us. I'm tired of trying to carry out the mandate of Christ, turning the other cheek. I've been slapped so many times, my cheeks are purple.''
 Bush administration officials say Mr. Chavez is responsible for his own undoing and they stand by all the charges he accuses them of spreading. They say his hunger for total power and his contempt for Venezuela's ruling class have pushed him to the tipping point. Even though one chamber of the Venezuelan Supreme Court overturned a decision by his government to disqualify more than 800,000 signatures on Monday, Mr. Chavez is pressing his case with another chamber of the court. 
 Richard A. Boucher, the State Department spokesman, said earlier this month, ''We think that all those people who signed petitions that their rights need to be respected.''
 With the American-assisted ouster of Haiti's president last month still reverberating in the region, the tensions with Washington have added urgency. The idea that an elected leader, one who challenges the elite by mobilizing a desperately poor, neglected population, could be ''kidnapped'' by American officials and whisked from his country is an unsettling precedent for Mr. Chavez.
 In a four-hour interview with The New York Times, arranged at his request, he portrayed himself as a moderate, tolerant leader locked in a political war with his country's elite and above all with the national news media. ''They have been employed in media terrorism -- inciting hatred, racism, calling on people not to recognize the official government, even calling on people to assassinate the president,'' he said. 
 If Mr. Chavez's ambitions include totalitarian control, even an infrequent visitor to Venezuela can see that he has fallen short after five years in power. His ''Bolivarian revolution'' has failed so far to improve stubborn indexes of misery, with unemployment officially at 20 percent and poverty still rising, from 60 to 70 percent, according to statistics by Andres Bello Catholic University.
 Petroleos de Venezuela, the national oil company, which is known by the acronym Pdvsa and has long been a cash cow for the elite, was devastated by a strike last year. Although it claims to have restored its production level of nearly three million barrels a day, Mr. Chavez's efforts to redistribute that wealth are scarcely seen.
 There is an improvised air to the Chavez government, and its roots appear wide but weak. Pdvsa (pronounced peh-deh-VEH-sah), which accounts for 73 percent of the country's export earnings, was taken over last year by Chavez loyalists, who remain baffled by its byzantine processes. ''We're still trying to figure out how Pdvsa works,'' said one Chavez adviser.
 The government's United Nations ambassador, Milos Alcalay, resigned this month, saying ''every day the government is more authoritarian.'' But Mr. Chavez is clearly beloved by the working class, who tell of small improvements in their daily lives -- a paint job for a dilapidated home or free access to roaming clinics staffed by Cuban doctors.
 Opposition leaders say their efforts have managed to keep Mr. Chavez in check. But the cost has been high. Venezuelan soldiers and policemen killed nine people and tortured others during a week of protests this month by opposition groups supporting the recall, according to the New York-based Human Rights Watch.
 Mr. Chavez told reporters the torture allegations were made up, and he accuses the opposition of sabotage -- work stoppages, destroying the oil-exporting infrastructure and the coup of 2002, when he was ousted by military officers and opposition leaders for 47 hours. ''The government of Bush was the first to recognize the coup,'' he noted ruefully. 
 The opposition, long divided, has found common purpose in an attempt to remove the president through the recall referendum.
 Mr. Chavez, after some prodding, conceded that a recall vote was all but inevitable. But he said his government would continue to scrutinize every signature. The government's current strategy relies on persuading the Supreme Court chamber responsible for constitutional issues to override the chamber responsible for electoral issues.
 The recall dispute hinges on a technicality: many on the recall lists did not fill out their own forms, though they provided signatures and thumbprints. That, the president says, is a clear violation of the rules.
 Mr. Chavez, 48, is the child of schoolteachers and fancies himself a teacher despite his background as a paratrooper. He jumps up from an interview to draw maps and graphs on a blackboard, and thumbs through dog-eared revolutionary texts.
 He looks and talks like the long-silent majority of lower-class Venezuelans. His most palpable legacy may be that he has taught the poor to demand more. That, said Maximilien Arlevaiz, an aide, is something that the dark-skinned Mr. Chavez will not be forgiven by the whiter-skinned elite. 
 He is self-absorbed but affable, and he interrupts the interview to talk to his 6-year-old daughter on the phone. ''Hello, my queen,'' he said. ''How are you, my life? How's the pig? Is she any bigger now? I'm going to send you a thousand kisses.''
 But he brooks little opposition, critics say. ''With him, you can't talk,'' Gabriel Garcia Marquez, the author, told El Universal. ''He lives accelerated, and it's not worth it, since he doesn't admit ideas that are different from his own.''
While he seems genuinely worried about his relations with Washington, he asserts that any effort to remove him by force would be calamitous for the United States. ''We aren't going to accept it,'' he said, warning, ''The price of oil will go up to $50 a barrel.''
 ''I thought since Bush came from an oil family, and given his political trajectory, that we would understand each other,'' he said. ''I can't believe that a government is willing to put at risk its supply of oil.''

Judges Are Investigated
CARACAS, March 17 (AP) -- Venezuela's government opened an investigation Wednesday that could lead to the removal of three Supreme Court judges who ruled that signatures on a petition for a vote to recall President Hugo Chavez were valid.
 The attorney general, the public defender and the controller general are investigating the judges for unethical behavior, the attorney general's office said. If they find wrongdoing, they will present their allegations to the National Assembly, which would vote on whether to remove the judges.
