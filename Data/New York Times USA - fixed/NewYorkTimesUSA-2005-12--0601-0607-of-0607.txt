HEADLINE: Don't Hold Your Breath for an Exciting Day in the Stock Market

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
IF it's excitement you crave, stock markets are losing their appeal.
 Back around the turn of the century, it seemed as if nearly every other day was an exciting one in the stock market, and not just in the United States. 
At the peak of volatility in the United States, from 2000 to 2002, the Standard & Poor's 500 showed a daily gain or loss of at least 1 percent for two days a week or more. And it was far from the most volatile market. In Germany in 2002, the average week had three big days.
 But volatility began to dip in 2003, fell sharply in 2004 and absolutely tumbled in 2005. In the United States, there were 52 days in 2002 when the index showed a move of 2 percent or more -- an average of one a week. That fell to 15, little better than one a month, in 2003. And there has not been one such day in the last two years.
 The accompanying charts show that in Britain, Germany, France, Japan, Hong Kong and the United States, the amount of stock market volatility in 2005 was at the lowest level since at least 1996.
 Explanations vary. Perhaps traders have learned to deal better with computerized program trading, which once could roil markets. Perhaps there is less concern over world economies collapsing. Certainly, Asian markets showed huge volatility in 1998, when currency crises seemed severe, while those in Europe and the United States showed a lot of volatility as stocks soared in the late 1990's and then fell sharply after the technology bubble burst.
 Or perhaps there is an excess of capital that feels it has nowhere to go but stocks. Individual stocks can still soar or collapse based on good news or bad, but money taken from one stock seems to flow to another, cushioning the daily movement of market indexes.
 If volatility were up, you can assume the rise of hedge funds would be blamed. Could they be partly responsible for the decline in volatility? No ready explanation for that comes to mind. 
 The big days tend to cancel each other out. Over the last decade in the six countries combined, just 52 percent of the big days have shown gains, although all the markets save Japan have shown considerable gains over the period.
 In Japan this year, there were nearly three big up days for every one large down day. And the Nikkei 225 was up 40 percent, its best showing for a year since 1986, back before the Japanese bubble burst. That rise left the index down more than half from the level it reached in 1989, reflecting just how painful the years since have been. 
 Over all, based on the number of big trading days in the last decade, the most volatile market was Germany, followed by Japan and Hong Kong. France ranked fourth, well ahead of the United States. Traders in Britain were the least excitable.

HEADLINE: NATO Troops Will Relieve Americans in Fighting the Taliban

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT

DATELINE: KANDAHAR AIR BASE, Afghanistan, Dec. 30 

 BODY:
NATO troops that will replace American soldiers in southern Afghanistan next spring are planning to conduct counterinsurgency missions against Taliban fighters and other militants despite initial opposition from some alliance members, American and allied commanders said Friday. 
 Soldiers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization now oversee security and reconstruction in northern and western Afghanistan, and are scheduled to replace more than 2,500 European-based American soldiers here in the south by March. Some allies, including Germany and France, had opposed expanding NATO's role to include the much riskier counterinsurgency missions.
But a senior officer from Canada said Friday that his country, which will command the NATO troops, will use the same rules of engagement that American forces have used. ''In Canada, it's clear that this is not a peacekeeping mission,'' said the officer, Col. S. J. Bowes, who heads a Canadian civil and military reconstruction team here. ''We understand that there is an active insurgency.'' 
 The American officer who will transfer command of the sector, Col. Kevin Owens, who leads the 173rd Airborne Brigade, said American and Canadian military teams had been working closely over the past several weeks to prepare for the transition. ''In every instance, at all levels, they are prepared to sustain the offensive nature of our operations here,'' he said. 
 The uncertainty over the alliance's commitment to counterinsurgency missions in the south had prompted some senior American commanders to warn that the slow but steady political, economic and security gains they say have been accomplished here could be at risk. Violence has flared in the south in the past several months, with Taliban forces conducting a campaign of assassinations, intimidation and roadside bombings that some military analysts say is aimed partly at shaking NATO's commitment.
 Britain and the Netherlands will join Canada in assuming control in the south, along with a much smaller contingent of American support troops. Maj. Gen. Jason K. Kamiya, the senior American ground commander in Afghanistan, expressed optimism on Friday that all three allies would heed pleas that they not limit troop operations.
 Such restrictions, called national caveats, have severely limited the kinds of missions allied forces can carry out in Afghanistan and Iraq, and have been a source of frustration for Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and his top regional commanders. 
 With NATO moving into the south, the Pentagon has said it will be able to reduce the overall number of American troops in Afghanistan to about 16,500 troops from 19,000 now. The United States will still have the largest number of foreign soldiers in Afghanistan, and will keep control of the country's eastern sector, the scene of many firefights and skirmishes along the mountainous border with Pakistan. 
 Newly trained Afghan soldiers and police officers are also playing a greater role, General Kamiya said, noting that the number of Afghan Army battalions has grown to 40 from 18 when he arrived in March. Twenty-four of those battalions are considered combat units. American trainers praised the Afghan forces' ability to glean intelligence and conduct small-unit operations, but cautioned that they were still dependent on American logistics and other support. 
 General Kamiya sought to play down the impact of the recent violence, saying the attacks, including several suicide bombings, were ''a sign of their desperation.'' He said there was no concrete evidence that tactics or foreign fighters were flowing directly from Iraq. Instead, he said impoverished Afghan youths who had been recruited by militant Islamic schools, or madrasas, were to blame for the rash of suicide bombings. 
 One of General Kamiya's senior subordinates, Col. Patrick J. Donahue, who commands 4,100 American troops in the eastern sector, said his forces had not engaged foreign fighters. ''The guys we're fighting and capturing are Afghans,'' he said.
 American intelligence officials have said, however, that the Taliban militants, who typically fight in groups of 15 to 20 men but can rally as many as 60, receive training and financial assistance from operatives of Al Qaeda in Pakistan. 
 The commanders spoke in interviews as Gen. Peter Pace, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, visited troops here and in Kabul.

HEADLINE: Good Year Globally For Stocks 

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS; Eric Dash contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
World stock markets ended a generally up year on a down note yesterday, leaving the Dow Jones industrial average in the United States with its first annual decline since 2002. 
 The Dow ended the year down 0.61 percent, at 10,717.50. But the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index -- the more closely watched benchmark among investing professionals -- ended the year up 3 percent, while the Nasdaq composite index closed up 1.37 percent.
Markets in Europe and Asia generally ended the year with gains of 15 percent or more, although those rises were partly offset by currency weaknesses against the dollar. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 index ended with its best year since 1986, despite a large drop yesterday. 
 Yesterday's declines appeared to reflect renewed concerns that the American economy may weaken in 2006. Most economists are forecasting a good year, with the gross domestic product rising more than 3 percent, but some traders were concerned by the fact that the yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell this week below the yield on the 2-year Treasury note
 Such an anomaly between short-term and long-term rates, known as an inverted yield curve, has in the past sometimes been followed by a recession. But interest rates have been one of the most surprising aspects of the economy this year, as widespread forecasts of rising long-term rates proved wrong. 
 With the slowdown in the housing market and the yield curve inverting, investors may have finally awakened to the prospects of slower growth, said Peter Boockvar, an equity strategist with Miller Tabak & Company. ''The irony is, the yield curve has been flattening for a while,'' he added.
 The 10-year Treasury note yielded 4.39 yesterday, marginally below the 4.40 percent yield on a 2-year Treasury bill. The yield on the 10-year note is down from 4.66 percent in early November, when economic optimism was higher, but it is up from 4.22 percent a year ago.
 Economists have expected the Federal Reserve's relentless increases in short-term rates to drive up long-term yields as well, but that has not happened -- a fact that Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, called a ''conundrum'' this year. It may reflect strong investments in Treasury securities from overseas, as traders were drawn to interest rates that are higher here than in Europe while the dollar has been strong.
 The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day at 10,717.50, down 67.32 points. The Dow, which in late November flirted with 11,000, had shown a small gain for the year through Thursday.
 That reversal ended one of Wall Street's traditional rules: that years ending in five work out well. The Dow, which dates back to 1896, had risen more than 20 percent in every year ending in five except for 1965, when it went up nearly 11 percent.
 The Standard & Poor's 500 fell 6.13 points yesterday, to 1,248.29, while the Nasdaq composite, fell 12.84, to 2,205.32. Overseas markets generally did well for the year, with the Nikkei 225 up 40.2 percent, despite falling 1.4 percent in the year's final session. The FTSE 100 index in Britain rose 16.7 percent, while the S.& P./MIB index in Italy added just 15.5 percent, making it the worst performer among major European indexes. Markets in France, Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands added more than 20 percent.
 The underperformance of the American market frustrated some in the United States. ''We in this country had just as good profit growth and G.D.P. growth as anywhere in the rest of the world,'' said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Wells Capital Management. He said he hoped that investors would conclude that the United States was relatively cheap and that there would be a rally early in 2006.
 In fact, the difference in performance declined when currency adjustments were added. The decline of the yen during the year cut the Japanese market gain, measured in dollars, to a still very good 22 percent, but of the major European markets, only Switzerland and Germany posted gains of more than 10 percent, measured in dollars.
 In the American market, energy stocks were the stars and ended the year on a strong note, with the energy sector of the S.& P. 500 rising 0.3 percent yesterday to finish up 29.8 percent for 2005.
 The personal computer industry contributed the second-best stock in the index and the second-worst. Apple Computer rose 123 percent, while Gateway fell 58 percent. The worst performer was Dana, an auto parts supplier that fell 59 percent.

HEADLINE: CRIME NUMBERS KEEP DROPPING ACROSS THE CITY

BYLINE: By AL BAKER

 BODY:
Crime has fallen across New York City for the 17th consecutive year, with subway crime down by more than 5 percent from last year and the number of recorded murders virtually certain to be the fewest in any single year since 1963, new Police Department statistics show.
 As of yesterday, there had been 537 killings in the city, according to the department's latest marking-period reports that are issued weekly. That is down from 566 in the same period last year. And it is down from 649 in all of 2001, when joblessness surged, anxiety from Sept. 11 was present and a budget crisis prompted a reduction in numbers of city police officers. In that year, some citizens and criminal justice experts predicted a bottoming out of the crime downturn as the police force took on new counterterrorism responsibilities.
New York reported its greatest number of murders in 1990, when 2,245 people lost their lives by violence.
 In 2005, in addition to murders, numbers for rape, felony assault, burglary and grand larceny all fell, the department said. 
 Auto theft, which, like murder, is considered a reliable indicator of crime patterns because there is little discretion in how to classify it and little reluctance in reporting it, fell by nearly 12 percent.
 ''When you get eight million people together, you will have some crime,'' said Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly. ''But is the city improving? And, is quality of life improving? Most believe that and believe that cops are doing a great job and crime is coming down.''
 New York's continuing decline is in contrast to some other cities across the nation. After years of falling crime, Boston is now experiencing a surge in homicides. Houston has seen more killings in 2005. In Philadelphia, murders are outpacing last year's rate. Some law enforcement officials have attributed rising murder rates outside of New York to use of the drug methamphetamine.
 David M. Kennedy, the director of the Center for Crime Prevention and Control at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan, said, ''Nobody else, anywhere, has been able to generate either the huge reductions in violent crime or sustain those reductions without reversal for 10 years, which is what New York has now done.''
 In the view of some critics, the overall numbers seem too good to be true. Officials in the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, the main police union, charged last year that precinct commanders felt such pressure to drive down crime that they ''cook the books,'' reducing the severity of crimes on paper to avoid recording them and reporting them to the F.B.I.
 But the department has an internal auditing system, said Michael J. Farrell, the deputy commissioner for strategic initiatives. Since that system was put in place in the early 1990's, the error rate has gone to 1.5 percent from 4.4 percent, he said. 
 ''The aspect of it that reassures us are the audits that we do, which are very substantial, in terms of the number,'' Mr. Farrell said. ''Every precinct is audited randomly, twice a year.''
 Of course, on any given day in the city, the streets can feel dangerous.
 Arrests for guns are up, heading into the last week of this year. Two police officers have been killed in the line of duty in recent weeks, and more officers were shot this year, 8, the highest number since 1997, when 10 were shot and one was killed. The 2005 murder tally could still increase by midnight tonight or when some 2005 deaths because of unknown causes are finally determined by the medical examiner.
 Shootings, a crime statistic the department has tracked for the last 12 years, were up by 3.2 percent, to 1,508 from 1,461. And the number of victims wounded in those shootings rose to 1,808 from 1,755. The shootings, though, were concentrated in a handful of precincts, and they have now started to fall. This year could well wind up with the second-lowest number of shootings since 1993.
 The precinct with the greatest number of incidents of gunfire in 2005 was the 75th Precinct, in East New York, Brooklyn, which recorded 92. The most gun arrests, 225, happened there, too.
 The citywide dips in five of the major crime categories was followed by roughly proportional dips in arrests for those crimes. But the number of robberies increased, by 0.8 percent, and, consequently, robbery arrests mushroomed to nearly 11 percent as the police focused on the problem. 
 Or, as Mr. Farrell put it, to ''re-inoculate'' a new generation of criminals ''who may not have gotten that vaccine.''
 Put in context, the rise in robberies, to 23,948 from 23,746, comes in a category of crime that is a mere shadow of its former self: their number peaked at 100,280 in 1990, said Thomas A. Reppetto, a police historian and executive director of the Citizens Crime Commission, a group that monitors police policies in New York.
 In all, the numbers collected, computerized and crunched by the New York Police Department reveal all manner of trends and developments.
 In 2005, eight precincts in the city recorded not a single murder -- vast parts of the city that included Central Park and the 94th Precinct in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, where there were four murders last year, and in 1990 there were eight.
 Five precincts, including one covering the Long Island City section of Queens and another, in the Fordham and Bedford Park sections of the Bronx, recorded some of the highest numbers of violent crimes this year. There were 229 robberies in the 108th Precinct in Queens, for instance. But even with those high numbers, it was those very precincts that recorded the greatest reductions when set against last year. For example, robberies in the 108th were down by 16 percent.
 Perception can be as much a measure of crime as reported statistics. In 1963, as today, some sensational cases made headlines for weeks. Then, it was the so-called Career Girl murders, the double homicide of a Newsweek researcher and a teacher on the Upper East Side. There were a total of 548 homicides that year. Now, it is Peter Braunstein, a writer suspected of posing as a firefighter in an Oct. 31 sex assault in Chelsea.
 Commissioner Kelly, for his part, said no floor for any crime is acceptable. The department tracks crime in ''real time,'' he said, and maps it down to street corners. 
 The manpower for Operation Impact, a program started by Mr. Kelly to flood problem areas with Police Academy recruits accompanied by more experienced officers, will be doubled next month to include 1,200 officers. A strategy of splitting the most violent precincts into thirds, Operation Trident, will be put in place in the 44th and 46th Precincts, he said.
 Many people, however, including Andrew Karmen, a criminologist who has analyzed the factors affecting the city's crime, have wondered just how long this trend -- what Dr. Karmen calls a ''crime crash'' -- can last.
 ''I think there is room for even further progress because in other large cities around the world, such as London and Tokyo, people get along even better with each other than we do,'' said Dr. Karmen, who wrote the book, ''New York Murder Mystery'' (N.Y.U. Press, 2000), about declining crime rates in the 1990's.
 Dr. Karmen said that most criminologists attribute New York's falling crime rate to both criminal justice and broader societal factors, including smarter police work, tougher sentencing, improved job opportunities and the perception of an improved economy.
 Mr. Kennedy said: ''The controversy remains. Is it something that law enforcement did, or isn't it? My thought is, you can't explain it without a very large contribution from law enforcement.''
 Heading into his second term, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said the record bodes well for the future.
 ''Every year, experts say we can't drive crime down any further, but happily the N.Y.P.D. proves them wrong and breaks another record,'' Mr. Bloomberg said.

HEADLINE: Resolved: I Will Take Good Advice 

BYLINE: By PAUL B. BROWN

 BODY:
ANTICIPATING that you might need help coming up with -- or keeping -- your New Year's resolutions, Business 2.0 asked 30 business visionaries, collectively worth over $70 billion, what single philosophy they swear by more than any other.
 Those leaders were told their answers could address success in business, life or both. What is most intriguing about their responses is how often they came up with comments that are applicable in both places. 
Here's a sample:
 Shelly Lazarus, chairman and chief executive of Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide: ''Unless you love your work, you won't find the balance. How can you, if you resent the time away from family spent at a tedious job?''
 Carol A. Bartz, chief executive of Autodesk: ''If you think you can't, you're right.''
 Warren E. Buffett, chairman and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway: ''When you get out of bed in the morning and think about what you want to do that day, ask yourself whether you'd like others to read about it on the front page of tomorrow's newspaper. You'll probably do things a little differently if you keep that in mind.''
 Mark Cuban, co-founder of HDNet and owner of the Dallas Mavericks: ''Treat your customers like they own you, because they do.''
 Carl C. Icahn, investor: ''Don't confuse luck with skill when judging others, and especially when judging yourself.''
 And this from the New York state attorney general, Eliot Spitzer: ''Never write when you can talk. Never talk when you can nod. And never put anything in an e-mail.''

GOOD FOOD -- If you have vowed to pay more attention to what you eat in 2006, you are not alone.
 Some 59 percent of customers of quick-serve restaurants said more nutritious items should be available. A third of all customers said ''they would visit one of their regular fast-food chains more often if they had more healthful items.'' 
 And 68 percent said they would visit a chain they didn't typically go to ''if it offered a better selection.''
 The findings are reported in this month's Chain Leader, which points out that the research doesn't tell you if customers would actually buy more healthy items if they were available.

TECH TALK -- Ever since the technology bubble burst in March 2000, at least one major magazine has used its December issue to predict that the coming 12 months will be the time when technology stocks come roaring back.
 This time it is Smart Money. ''We think 2006 will finally be the year,'' Rob Wherry writes.
 He points to record technology spending (Forrester Research says it will hit $806 billion in 2006, up 18 percent from 2003), Microsoft's introduction of its new Windows operating system next year and the need to replace equipment destroyed by the Gulf Coast hurricanes.
 ''With so many opportunities -- and still a few minefields -- we think it makes sense for most people to invest in the sector through actively managed mutual funds,'' Mr. Wherry writes. ''Good managers can identify winners before they become widely apparent. And unlike narrowly focused index funds and exchange-traded funds, they can avoid putting their cash into stocks that become too expensive.''
 He identifies four funds he thinks will do well: Allianz RCM Global Technology, T. Rowe Price Science and Technology, Waddell & Reed Science and Technology and Fidelity Capital Appreciation. 
 It's hard not be in favor of bull runs. But it should be pointed out that the Nasdaq composite would have to more than double to reach the high of 5,048 it hit on March 10, 2000. 

FINAL TAKE -- Some 53 percent of Self magazine readers said ''they would prefer to lose 10 pounds for good than earn $10,000 more a year,'' a stance the magazine finds questionable.
 ''Slimming down won't change your life, but an extra K$10 $10K a year might. Each year, put the dough in a certificate of deposit; in five years, you'll have about $55,000 with interest. That's enough for a personal chef and trainer if you still need to ditch the weight.'' Happy New Year. PAUL B. BROWN

HEADLINE: The Poker World Is Flat, Part 1

BYLINE: By James McManus

 BODY:
In his optimistic best seller ''The World Is Flat,'' the New York Times columnist Thomas L. Friedman uses ''flat'' as a synonym for connected -- digitally, that is, by fiber-optic cables. Friedman makes a compelling case that a ''triple convergence'' of Internet technology with economic and political events at the dawn of the 21st century has generated ''more horizontal and collaborative'' means of creating value. While warning of several dangers lurking in this global topology, he celebrates the more level playing field and the breathtaking variety of opportunities for those with the imagination and technical training to seize them.
 The online poker boom is a telling example of flatness, of course, and that ''The World Is Flat'' doesn't mention it is the subject of my next column. For now let me focus on another strange fact, namely how unruffled the virtual poker world is by the Justice Department's contention that it violates American law. 
A recent front-page article in The Times reported that despite the illegal status of online casinos in this country, even blue-chip houses like Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs have begun to buy their stock. The article noted that the increasing fervor of American investors ''highlights the difficulty of policing cross-border activity in the Internet age at the same time that electronic commerce and a global economy are creating fast economic partners across national boundaries.''
 According to industry research, more than $60 billion has been wagered on more than 200 poker sites in 2005, most of it lost or won by Americans. For the last two years, traffic on the leading Web sites has doubled about every six months. On Dec. 1, Morgan Stanley reported that Sportingbet was taking in $530,000 a day from its poker business. PartyGaming has been valued as high as $12 billion since its initial public offering in London on June 30 raised more than $8 billion; PartyPoker.com, the world's busiest virtual card room, accounts for 92 percent of PartyGaming's revenues. 
 Several factors make online poker appealing to players: speed, convenience, weak competition, no need to tip dealers. Some sites provide hand histories that help track tendencies and plug leaks in our game, and to profit from those in our opponents'. Even more important is the absence of physical tells. Picking up on betting patterns becomes more important than raw psychological acumen. 
 There's no intimidating eye contact here, though comments in the chat box can be withering. About half of all online players are women, some of whom want to avoid an aggressive casino environment. Novices of either sex can compete for pennies, or for play money only. The big sites offer the opportunity to choose among thousands of games, from play money up to six-figure stakes. With action available around the clock, there's no need to get on an airplane, drive to a casino or even put on a clean shirt.
 Blogs and chat rooms teem with charges of dealing that is programmed to give multiple players good hands, thereby increasing the bets and the rake, and of sites rigging the deal to prevent new players from losing so quickly that they become discouraged. No hard evidence, however, has been produced to support such claims. I would also point out that the 5 percent rake most sites take is more than sufficiently juicy, and that nonrandom dealing would slaughter the platinum goose. Those who claim to see far more bad beats online should remember that virtual games deal at least twice as many hands an hour; the more hands you play, the more bad beats you will suffer. Sophisticated software also lets the sites check hand histories and IP addresses for evidence of player collusion.
 Another thing I like is that the world can seem very tiny, and timeless, while you're playing online. My opponents this morning on PokerStars.com include birdwings from Lebanon, alexia18 from Dusseldorf, dedor from Tel Aviv and wasp from County Derry. As we chat and compete, they could be sitting in front of a desktop computer at home or a laptop three gates down the concourse from me. Next week two or more of us might be sitting elbow to elbow at the live event held by PokerStars.com in the Bahamas, a tournament played mostly by people who won their $8,000 seat on the site. The prize money will be deposited in PokerStars accounts, then recirculate back into -- where?
 A lot of folks besides federal prosecutors wonder exactly where all this virtual action takes place. In a cable submerged 619 miles east-northeast of Paradise Island? Well, in the case of PartyPoker.com, the home office is in Gibraltar; the hardware in Kahnawake, a Mohawk reservation in Canada; and the marketing office in London, though most staff members work in a call center in Hyderabad, India. The players are in 24 time zones across six continents and on scores of ships at sea.
 As millions more virtual hands are dealt this New Year's Eve, poker seems poised to become the world's game. The World Series has already crowned champions from China, Iran, Vietnam, Ireland, Spain and Australia. While the Justice Department figures out how to proceed, our national pastime, born during Jefferson's presidency, remains a sturdy crucible in which players from all over the planet find themselves welcome contenders.

HEADLINE: So, Guy Walks Up to the Bar, and Scalia Says 

BYLINE: By ADAM LIPTAK; Jonathan Corum contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Justice Antonin Scalia's wit is widely admired, and now it has been quantified. He is, a new study concludes, 19 times as funny as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
 Transcripts of oral arguments at the United States Supreme Court have long featured the notation ''[laughter]'' after a successful quip from a justice or lawyer. But until October 2004, justices were not identified by name, making it impossible to construct a reliable index of judicial wit.
That has now changed, and Jay D. Wexler, a law professor at Boston University, was quick to exploit the new data to analyze the relative funniness of the justices. His study, which covers the nine-month term that began that October, has just been published in a law journal called The Green Bag. 
 Justice Scalia was the funniest justice, at 77 ''laughing episodes.'' On average, he was good for slightly more than one laugh -- 1.027, to be precise -- per argument. 
 Justice Stephen G. Breyer was next, at 45 laughs. Justice Ginsburg produced but four laughs. Justice Clarence Thomas, who rarely speaks during arguments, gave rise to no laughter at all.
 Of course, what passes for humor at the Supreme Court would probably not kill at the local comedy club. Consider, for instance, the golden opportunity on Halloween this year when a light bulb in the courtroom's ceiling exploded during an argument.
 It takes two justices, it turns out, to screw up a light bulb joke.
 ''It's a trick they play on new chief justices all the time,'' Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who joined the court that month, said of the explosion.
 ''[Laughter.]''
 ''Happy Halloween,'' Justice Scalia retorted.
 ''[Laughter.]''
 And then, the kicker. ''We're even more in the dark now than before,'' Chief Justice Roberts said.
 ''[Laughter.]''
 On the other hand, in a January argument in a statute-of-limitations case, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy made an amusing observation about the absurdity of modern life.
 ''Recently I lost my luggage,'' Justice Kennedy said. ''I had to go to the lost and found at the airline, and the lady said has my plane landed yet.''
 ''[Laughter.]''
 Professor Wexler concedes that his methodology is imperfect. The court reporters who insert the notations may, for instance, be unreliable or biased. 
 The simple notation ''[laughter]'' does not, moreover, distinguish between ''a series of small chuckles'' and ''a joke that brought the house down.'' Nor, Professor Wexler said, does it separate ''the genuine laughter brought about by truly funny or clever humor and the anxious kind of laughter that arises when one feels nervous or uncomfortable or just plain scared for the nation's future.''
 Partisans of particular justices may raise objections as well. The raw numbers for Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, who produced 12 laughs, understate his wit, as he missed more than 30 arguments in the term because of illness. He died in September.
 Justice Ginsburg's poor showing may in part be a matter of misperception based on her grave mien. 
 ''It is widely believed that Justice Ginsburg doesn't even laugh herself, much less make others laugh,'' Professor Wexler, a law clerk for her in 1998 and 1999, wrote. ''I can attest that she does, in fact, laugh. Maybe not often, perhaps not loudly or with great vigor and the wild waving of arms, but laugh she does.''
 Justice Scalia's numbers may similarly overstate his wit, if only because the courtroom expects quips from him and may laugh at the least provocation. Also, he tried hard.
 ''He plays to the crowd,'' said Pamela S. Karlan, a Stanford law professor and Supreme Court advocate who has garnered her own share of laughter notations in the transcripts. 
 Sometimes, the laughter that apparently filled the courtroom is hard to comprehend. Chief Justice Roberts, for instance, got a laugh for this observation at an October argument on assisted suicide: ''The relationship between the states and the federal government has changed a little since Gibbons v. Ogden,'' a landmark decision in 1824 about national regulation of the economy.
 Lawyers get laughs sometimes, too, but it is a dangerous business. In the guidebook the court provides to lawyers preparing to argue before it, there is this stern warning: ''Attempts at humor usually fall flat.''
 Thomas C. Goldstein, a Washington lawyer who appears before the court frequently, said humor ''is a land mine.''
 ''You have to follow the justices' lead,'' Mr. Goldstein said. ''You have to be a straight man.''
 Lawyers confuse one justice with another surprisingly often, and those mix-ups are, of course, an opportunity for humor.
 Last November, Sri Srinivasan, a government lawyer, apologized to Justice David H. Souter for referring to him as Justice Scalia.
 ''Thank you,'' Justice Souter said, with characteristic self-deprecation, ''but apologize to him.''
 ''[Laughter.]''
 The New York Times, building on Professor Wexler's pioneering work, analyzed the available transcripts for the term that began this October. The mood under Chief Justice Roberts has brightened, the analysis found, with the average number of justice-generated laughs per argument rising to 2.9 from 2.6 the previous term. 
 In the current term, the Times analysis found, there has also been movement in the funniness-of-individual-justices department. Justice Breyer has taken the lead, at 28 laughs, edging out Justice Scalia, with 25. They also tied in the largest-number-of-jokes-in-a-single-argument category, each squeezing five into a single hour. 
 Chief Justice Roberts made a strong early showing, coming in third, with 13.
 ''It looks like he'll be competitive,'' Professor Wexler said in an interview.
 Justice Clarence Thomas continues to bring up the rear, with what is shaping up to be another jokeless term for him.
 A ''laughter'' notation is relatively common, having been awarded 1,676 times since 1979. ''Mirth'' has made only six appearances, all in 1987 and 1988. 
 Professor Wexler said the new data could be refined further, given that some justices ask more questions and thus give themselves more opportunities to provoke laughter. As with baseball batters, the true test is not in the absolute number of hits but in success divided by opportunity.
 But Professor Wexler said he had decided not to pursue laughter-per-question research.
 ''That's not going to happen,'' he said. ''Unless I get a grant.''

 Official transcripts of arguments before the Supreme Court occasionally indicate ''[laughter]'' in the courtroom. Questions, comments and jokes by Justice Antonin Scalia provoked the most laughter last term, while Justice Stephen G. Breyer leads the current term.
