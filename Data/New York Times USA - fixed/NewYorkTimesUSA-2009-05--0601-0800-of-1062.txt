HEADLINE: Schools Wrestle With Stimulus Aid and Taxes

BYLINE: By NICOLE NEROULIAS

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS 

 BODY:
 AS they prepare for tough budget votes on Tuesday, school district officials in Westchester have greeted federal stimulus funds with a mixture of relief, wariness and confusion.
 Flowing to the county as more than $70 million in restored state aid and special-education and poverty assistance, the allotments will be used to prevent classroom cuts without increasing taxes, school officials said. Most districts have either absorbed the funds or put them toward new positions or programs, but some have held off, waiting for more specific guidelines.
 ''Everyone wants to use it, but there's a lot of questions about how you're allowed to use it,'' said Lisa P. Davis, executive director of the Westchester-Putnam School Boards Association. ''You're supposed to use it to supplement, not supplant. You can use it to save jobs, but make sure you don't do anything that has your district falling off a cliff in two years when the funds run out.'' 
 Such mixed messages from federal and state authorities have fueled the conflicts between teacher groups, which want to prevent further job losses, and taxpayers who have spoken out at school board meetings across the county, vowing to vote down budget increases.
 In White Plains, where teachers have worked without a contract since June, district officials have proposed a $186 million budget, with a 0.7 percent tax levy increase, that would reduce 58 positions -- 15 by layoff -- while incorporating only part of the stimulus funds into the shortfall.
 Cuts would have been steeper without taking $2 million in restored state aid into account, said Fred W. Seiler, assistant superintendent for business of White Plains schools. The district may be able to restore some positions over the summer, he said, when it becomes clearer how it can use its $1 million special-education grant from the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act and $266,000 in Title IA funds for disadvantaged students.
 But Kerry Broderick, president of the White Plains Teachers Association, argued that by sitting on the money while handing out pink slips, the district was essentially using stimulus money to reduce its tax levy -- a practice prohibited by state guidelines. 
 ''There is no intention by the board to use any of the stimulus money to restore teachers,'' Ms. Broderick said, warning that class sizes were bound to increase with fewer instructors, perhaps to levels more painful for families than a tax increase. ''Their intent is to use it to lower taxes, exactly what they are not to do.''
 Richard C. Iannuzzi, president of the New York State United Teachers, said districts that have accepted stimulus money but still plan to cut staff positions to keep tax rates low are engaging in ''brazen misuse'' of the funds.
 ''I don't disagree with the fact that, especially in Westchester and Long Island, the issue of property taxes is a very real one and you need to find some relief,'' he said. ''But this is a federal program that was deliberately designed to turn around the freefall that our economy was in, by preventing more people from being unemployed and restoring some people who had lost their jobs.''
 In response, White Plains school officials say that even after allocating all of the stimulus funds, the community cannot afford and therefore will not accept the budget increases needed to keep every program fully staffed. 
 ''The dilemma here is that our community wanted to be at zero, so if you put it all in the budget and the budget gets defeated, then you're worse off than before,'' Mr. Seiler said.
 Most Westchester districts are presenting budgets with tax increases below 3 percent. The average increase for budgets in Westchester and Putnam is 1.92 percent; for tax levies, 2.05 percent.
 The highest proposed increase for a tax levy, 9.9 percent, is in Mount Vernon, the county's poorest district. The economy has only gotten worse since Mount Vernon voters rejected the budget last year, but the district has no choice, Superintendent W. L. Sawyer said. The $203.2 million proposal uses all of its $4.5 million in stimulus funds and about $76 million in regular state aid, but still comes up short, he said. 
 And unlike neighboring districts, Mount Vernon does not have reserve funds to draw on; even if the budget is defeated and an austerity budget is in place, it would require an 8.8 percent tax levy just to keep up with mandated health benefits, utilities and loan-repayment increases and to reinstate funding for varsity sports that had been cut last year, Dr. Sawyer said. 
 ''We're only trying to stay above water at this juncture,'' he said. ''We're cutting back on basics here every day.''
 Even wealthy districts like Scarsdale that historically pass budgets on the first try and do not qualify for any Title IA funds have approached the vote on Tuesday with caution.
 Scarsdale's $131 million budget proposal, which would mean a 1.7 percent tax levy increase for residents, has not taken its $461,272 special-education grant into account. With conflicting information from state officials about when the money will be available and whether it can be used for existing expenses or must be for new or expanded offerings, Scarsdale has not felt comfortable applying the funds to the 2009-10 budget, even though it could lower the tax levy, said Linda Purvis, assistant superintendent for business. 
 ''We can't go out to the community and tell them we don't need that tax money, when in fact we do,'' she said. ''This is the kind of thing that makes you lose sleep.''

HEADLINE: Lessons the Teacher Forgot

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN

 BODY:
Back in what felt like the golden age of finance, before the fine print of mortgage documents suddenly became relevant and ordinary people in bars began sharing their worries about credit default swaps, American banking was celebrated as the envy of the world.
 Blue jeans and electronics were arriving from factories scattered from China to Costa Rica, and even white-collar jobs were slipping overseas, but the sophisticated work of measuring risk and engineering investments remained the province of the geniuses running Wall Street. Their mastery was more lucrative than ever, and it was emulated around the globe. 
 So it registered as a comedown last week to read that Bank of America was selling part of its stake in the Construction Bank of China, as it scrambled to secure cash in the face of its real estate-related disasters. 
 Yes, it has come to this: The largest bank in the United States, putative citadel of free enterprise, must desperately unload shares in a bank controlled by the Communist Party of China. That, or risk the wrath of American regulators, newly concerned about how much money financial institutions have on hand. 
 Meanwhile, the Treasury last week outlined proposed new rules for derivatives, the exotic investments whose unsupervised trading was once offered up as a sign of the vibrancy of American financial innovation, only to become a prime example of how Wall Street set fire to the global economy.
 Not four years ago, when Bank of America paid $3 billion for a 9 percent stake in Construction Bank as part of a wave of foreign investment into China, it was supposed to be a sign of Wall Street's superior money management. American banks -- not just Bank of America, but Citibank, Merrill Lynch and others -- portrayed their purchases of Chinese institutions as savvy, strategic plays; a way to get a foothold in the world's largest potential market for seemingly everything. 
 Still shaking off the cobwebs of its failed experiment in Maoist utopia, China was home to 1.3 billion people whose wallets awaited credit cards, 2.6 billion feet eager for Nike sneakers, and 13 billion fingers waiting to be licked in the thrall of KFC chicken.
 American banking executives spoke paternalistically of their Chinese counterparts. Yes, China's banking system was laced with corruption, but the American banks would bring their culture of modern finance and teach their new charges how to lend with a dispassionate eye on the bottom line.
 ''We see value in combining their local knowledge and distribution with our product expertise, technology and experience with size and scale,'' Bank of America's chief executive, Ken Lewis, said as he consummated the deal to purchase a piece of Construction Bank in June 2005. 
 Chinese leaders spoke of their great fortune in gaining Wall Street's tutelage. ''We have much to learn from our partner in serving customers and creating shareholder value,'' said Construction Bank's chairman, Guo Shuqing. 
 These days, of course, talk of Bank of America and shareholder value centers on how much of the company its newest shareholder -- Uncle Sam -- is destined to own, and whether the bank's shares retain any value. Bank of America's expertise with size and scale has expanded to encompass the management of $45 billion in bailout funds. 
 For much of Wall Street, the expertise that once was expected to elevate China's financial system increasingly looks like sorcery, or a vast Ponzi scheme in which banks borrowed vast sums, lent to virtually anyone, and used incomprehensible models to convince markets that all was fine. They scattered low-interest credit cards and home equity loan offers like takeout menus, creating the illusion of prosperity by driving up home values.
 In effect, American banks operated not unlike the Chinese banks they were supposed to modernize. They extracted profits by following a variation of the principle long pursued by their Chinese counterparts: lend without hesitation while extracting your cut, confident that the government is on the hook for the losses.
 In China, ventures may be spectacularly unprofitable, yet enrich everyone lucky enough to get a piece. Developers, for example, construct vacant office buildings as an excuse to borrow from state banks. They rake off a cut for themselves, pay bribes to the party officials who deliver the land and reward bank functionaries with sumptuous banquets and trips to Macao. Soon enough, the trophy skyscraper descends into financial disaster, but the developers, bankers and party officials have already extracted their riches, and for long afterward they will still enjoy them. 
 Much the same can be said of Countrywide, the mortgage lender that sold itself to Bank of America last year in a fire sale, after many of its loans went bad. Shareholders were mostly wiped out. Homeowners suffered foreclosure. But the company's executives made out brilliantly, cashing stock options amassed during the real estate boom, when Countrywide's share price soared along with its loan volume. Ditto the Wall Street bankers who enabled Countrywide to lend with abandon by selling their mortgages to investors.
 Now the easy money is gone. Wall Street's financial alchemy has broken down, and bankers are freshly concerned about the creditworthiness of their borrowers. Bank of America is in such a fix that the investment it once portrayed as a helping hand to the primitive Chinese banking system must be sold off in haste just to stay alive.
 Shorn of their auras as global paragons of excellence, American banks are even facing pressure to act more like the Chinese banks they were supposed to reform -- by lending in support of politically necessary projects.
 The biggest criticism of Chinese banks has been that they lend not on the financial merits but in adherence to the wishes of party leaders. Fearful that a large state company may fail and disgorge angry, unemployed peasants onto the streets, local party officials pressure state banks to keep the credit flowing and spare the jobs.
 In recent months, the center of the American financial system has effectively shifted from New York toward Washington, as taxpayer funds keep many institutions in business. Lawmakers and Treasury officials now implore the banks to use their bailout funds to increase lending, even as the banks themselves worry about the merits of making loans in a weak economy -- the very conundrum Chinese bankers understand all too well.
 Perversely, Bank of America is being forced to shrink its China stake just as it might actually have something to learn about banking from its Chinese partner.

HEADLINE: How Wearing Less Could Help Africa

BYLINE: By KARIN NELSON

 BODY:
TIRED of seeing T-shirts that benefited Africa but were produced in China, Yodit Eklund and her brother, Yohannes Mekbebe, started Bantu, a swimwear line that supports Africa's economy from the inside out: its many-colored prints come from West Africa, the heartland of Africa's textile industry, and the cutting and sewing is done in Ethiopia. 
 ''We wanted to do something African that would employ people and promote sustainable business,'' said Ms. Eklund, who was born to an American father and an Ethiopian mother, and studied environmental economics at the University of California, Berkeley. Given the continent's vibrant beach culture, swimwear seemed an obvious concept. ''It would be pretty difficult to launch a ski brand from Africa,'' she noted.

HEADLINE: Struggling to Escape Mortgage 'Quicksand'

BYLINE: By KAREEM FAHIM

DATELINE: UNION TOWNSHIP 

 BODY:
 THE refrigerator and the furniture have been sent to storage, and the only traces of the family pictures that lined the living room walls are the nails. The family's clothes sit in plastic bins, waiting to be moved somewhere -- a rented apartment, maybe -- if Kenneth Kruse can't save his house.
 ''I feel like I'm in quicksand,'' said Mr. Kruse, a 36-year-old truck driver who said he owes mortgage payments totaling over $40,000 -- more than his yearly salary and almost a third of what he paid for his house 11 years ago. ''I don't know what's going to happen.'' 
 Their home, a gray Cape Cod in the Battle Hill neighborhood where Mr. Kruse grew up, was supposed to be a starter house. They bought it in 1997 for about $140,000, which seemed within their means. Mr. Kruse had held the same job, with the local board of education in this Union County town, since 1993, and his wife worked part time as a bank teller.
 ''We lived paycheck to paycheck,'' Mr. Kruse said. ''I didn't buy when the market was high. I didn't even buy one of the houses that cost $20,000 more.''
 Mr. Kruse could not pinpoint the primary thing that put his family on the path toward foreclosure, which he said was scheduled for the end of May, but he cited several contributing factors. An injury two years ago -- herniated disks -- kept him home from work for more than 10 months, he said, and though he received disability checks, he lost the income from his second job as a bartender. 
 To fix a leaky roof on the home and pay debts his family incurred when his mother-in-law died, Mr. Kruse refinanced his house in 2006, taking out a $200,000 loan with a variable interest rate that increased his monthly payments. And a few years ago, he and his wife tried to start a dance studio, a dream of hers that they sank their savings into. But they were forced out of the rented space when a larger company wanted it, and they decided to abandon the business.
 More recently, as he fell further and further behind on his mortgage payments, he said, his lender stopped accepting whatever he tried to pay. Mr. Kruse is not even sure who holds his loans today, rattling off a list of lenders whose stationery he has seen in recent years. 
 Earlier this year, his sister-in-law told him about a state-sponsored mediation program between banks and borrowers, a program run by the New Jersey judiciary that provides loans and free legal assistance. Mr. Kruse said he quickly filled out the paperwork to participate, but he said he was told he did not qualify.
 He ended up working with a private mediation company based in Rhode Island, hoping that the mortgage arrears could be added to his loan principal and that he could then go back to making monthly payments. But last week, the company told him his lender was not willing to negotiate unless Mr. Kruse paid about $15,000 of what he owed. 
 Now, he is preparing his son and his daughter to move, and wondering how, with his ruined credit, he will find somewhere else to live. He said he and his wife had tried to prepare for hard times, but they never expected to face a crisis like this before the age of 40. 
 ''It's like we had 60 rainy days,'' Mr. Kruse said.

HEADLINE: From 'Pink Films' to Oscar Gold

BYLINE: By MIKE HALE

 BODY:
YOJIRO TAKITA has surprised American audiences before. In 1986, when he was known only as a director of the soft-core features called pink films, he broke into the Japanese mainstream with ''Comic Magazine,'' a low-budget guerrilla production about a self-loathing television reporter on the celebrity gossip beat. It snagged a spot in the New Directors/New Films series at the Museum of Modern Art; Vincent Canby, the critic for The New York Times, called it ''scurrilously funny,'' and it went on to a commercial run in New York. 
 So Mr. Takita was not coming entirely out of the blue on Feb. 22 at the Kodak Theater in Los Angeles, when he spoiled countless Oscar pool entries by snatching the best foreign-language film award for ''Departures,'' his melancholy drama about a man who takes a job preparing corpses for burial. So heavily favored were the Israeli and French entries, ''Waltz With Bashir'' and ''The Class,'' that Mr. Takita and his leading man, Masahiro Motoki, had to convince each other that they had, in fact, just heard their movie announced as the winner. (By the time the ''Departures'' delegation made it backstage, the news had sunk in sufficiently for a producer of the film to get off one of the night's better lines: ''I'm so happy. I could depart right now.'')
 In the more than two decades between ''Comic Magazine'' and ''Departures'' Mr. Takita had established himself as a versatile and highly successful filmmaker in Japan, with three best-director nominations in Japan's equivalent of the Academy Awards (he won this year for ''Departures'') and a best-picture award in 2004 for ''When the Last Sword Is Drawn,'' an elaborate historical drama about the end of the shogunate in the 19th century. But when his Oscar victory suddenly brought him to the attention of the rest of the world, the one section of his resume that every article mentioned was his apprenticeship in pinku eiga, the pink films that were once a huge part of the Japanese movie industry.
 ''Yes, my career as a director did start out in pink films,'' Mr. Takita said last month before the Tribeca Film Festival screening of ''Departures'' (which opens on May 29 in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago). It's a background he shares with well-known Japanese filmmakers like Kiyoshi Kurosawa (''Tokyo Sonata'') and Masayuki Suo (''Shall We Dance''). ''But frankly,'' he added, ''at my age I look back, and pink films, regular films, to me they're all part of the movies that I made. And they all express the joy I feel in the privilege I have of making all the decisions that create a world called a movie.''
 A youthful 53, Mr. Takita radiates the confidence required to make the myriad decisions involved in directing a movie like ''When the Last Sword Is Drawn'' or his 2001 hit, ''Onmyoji,'' a story of ghosts and wizards set 1,000 years ago in the Fujiwara court during the Heian period. (At a joint interview conducted through a translator at the Kitano Hotel in Manhattan, he and Mr. Motoki were also, as Japanese artists tend to be, more stylishly dressed and more polite than the American norm.) 
 After a string of movies that combined history and mythology, swordplay and sorcery and special effects, ''Departures'' was a change of pace. The idea for the film came from Mr. Motoki, who in his late 20s (he's now 43) read a book written by a nokanshi, or encoffineer. (The film's Japanese title, ''Okuribito,'' or send-off person, is another name for the same function.) For some Japanese funerals an encoffineer is hired to perform a ritual of bathing and dressing the body before it is placed in the coffin for cremation. Mr. Motoki was taken by ''the world that the encoffineer was describing, where the baton of human life is passed from one generation to the next in this very moment in time during the encoffining ritual.''
 ''And so I thought maybe by squarely acknowledging that moment of death and the immediate moment after,'' he said, ''it might be a way for a film to be made that could ultimately, sort of counterintuitively, affirm human life.''
 Mr. Motoki's character, Daigo, is a cellist whose orchestra is disbanded without warning. Answering an ad for what he thinks is a job at a travel agency, he stumbles into his new career and is taken in hand by a master encoffineer (Tsutomu Yamazaki, familiar to American moviegoers of a certain age as the truck driver and gourmand Goro in ''Tampopo''). Mr. Motoki's first challenge was finding the money for a film that mixed dead bodies and Japan's long economic malaise. ''Well, I did pitch it to several producers,'' he said, ''but they all felt that death was not actually a good idea for a movie, so it took a long time.''
 Eventually a producer was found, and Mr. Takita came aboard, attracted, he said, by the challenge: ''I figured probably nobody else would go for it, so I figured what the hell, I'll go for it. I'll get behind it. I really was genuinely fascinated with the world of the encoffineer and with that ritual. I tend to be interested in peeking up under the covers where most people prefer to let them lie.''
 To prepare for the film Mr. Motoki had to learn how to handle two things he had never touched before: a cello and a corpse. His training with an encoffineer included helping out during an actual ceremony, in which they prepared the body of a grandmother. ''It was in February, and it was cold enough outside, but when I touched the cold corpse, I sort of was imbued with a sense of mission,'' he said, ''to try to use as much human warmth as I could to restore this grandmother to a lifelike presence for presentation to her family.''
 Once the film was finished, another long wait ensued: 13 months passed before a distributor could be found. But the delay was a godsend, both men said. Mr. Takita conjectured that the worsening economic climate primed audiences for the film. ''Is money the most important thing in life?'' he said. ''What is the most important thing in life? People certainly are in search of some kind of comfort, of safe haven, and whether they find that in music or in books or in films, it's pretty clear that people are looking for something.'' 
 On the more practical side, Mr. Motoki pointed out that just before its domestic release last fall, ''Departures'' won the grand prize at the Montreal Film Festival. The movie is still showing in Japan eight months after its release and through mid-April had grossed more than $60 million, a huge number for a Japanese production.
 After Montreal and a basketful of awards in Japan -- including another best-film prize from the Japanese academy -- the Oscar was ''the icing on the cake,'' Mr. Takita said. And it was a flavor he could get used to.
 ''I'll never forget how the audience looked from on top of that stage,'' he said. ''Humans are naturally greedy, so once we have an experience like that, of course we want to have it again.''

HEADLINE: Boarded-Up and Foreclosed, Houses Await Action by Newark and Partners

BYLINE: By JEFFERY C. MAYS

DATELINE: NEWARK 

 BODY:
 ROBBIE JOHNSON doesn't like what she sees from the porch of the three-family house she rents on Seymour Avenue in Newark. The 61-year-old resident moved into one unit two months ago to wait while a spot in a senior housing complex opens for her.
 ''I just moved here and I'm already sorry I moved here,'' she said as she waited for a ride to the doctor. 
 This stretch of Seymour Avenue in the Clinton Hill section once had one of the highest homeownership rates in Newark. But now, Ms. Johnson barely has to turn her head to look at six homes that are in foreclosure or have been left vacant. Teenagers party in the vacant houses and an accumulation of trash is attracting rats and mice, she said.
 ''What bothers me are these vacant houses,'' she said. ''It affects you and your view. It affects your health.'' 
 At least 60 homes on Seymour Avenue have been in some stage of foreclosure since 2005, according to an analysis of foreclosure data across the region by The New York Times. 
 ''Seymour Avenue probably looks the worst,'' said Kathe Newman, an assistant professor of Urban Planning and Policy Development at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University who has extensively studied foreclosures in the state's largest city.
 This block is one of the dozens that Newark officials are trying to save. Newark has a 23 percent homeownership rate, lower than many other cities, and foreclosure is affecting some of the city's most stable neighborhoods with the highest home ownership rates like Clinton Hill, Vailsburg and the new residential areas that sprouted during the building boom of the 1990s, including Sumo Village in the South Ironbound section. 
 Using $3.4 million in federal money from the July 2008 Housing and Economic Recovery Act, city officials have begun a program to allow area nonprofit organizations to buy, repair and resell foreclosed homes. The new owners will undergo homeownership classes. The city will also compete for a chunk of $2 billion from President Obama's $787 billion stimulus package that will be distributed by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development to expand its programs and to help surrounding municipalities. 
 Newark has embarked on a series of events to educate homeowners about fraudulent homeowner-assistance programs. In one such event in March, residents fanned out through Newark and took down more than 700 ''We Buy Houses'' signs that officials say are posted by people looking to swindle troubled owners. 
 Two other events that brought together lenders and homeowners to discuss how to renegotiate mortgages that are in arrears attracted about 1,000 people.
 ''This is the most amazing collaboration between the city, nonprofits and the community,'' Ms. Newman said. ''The city has been working aggressively to build relationships. The sign-teardown effort was important to bring the community together and eliminate the potential for scams.''
 The city said it would use another powerful tool at its disposal to get banks to help homeowners who are on the brink of losing their homes. Officials have said that the city will make its decisions about where to deposit its vast accounts, from tax collections and other funds, by looking at which banks are most cooperative.
 ''The key to successfully enabling residents to work out their foreclosures is sometimes as simple as sitting them down with their lenders,'' said Stefan Pryor, the deputy mayor for economic development. ''The criteria by which we judge which banks to use will include how responsive they are to dealing with foreclosures.''
 In 2005, Newark had more than 600 homes in foreclosure. In the first eight months of 2008, the city had more than 1,800, according to the analysis by The Times of foreclosure data. 
 Subprime loans -- which had looser lending standards and higher interest rates than other loans -- made up 60 percent of primary- and secondary-lien home mortgages granted between 2005 and 2007 in Newark, compared with 22 percent in New Jersey, according to an analysis of mortgage lending data by The Times. 
 The interest rates on more than 2,200 loans are expected to adjust upward by the end of this year, said Michael Meyer, Newark's director of housing and real estate, which might mean many borrowers will face higher payments, and possibly more trouble meeting them.
 Joseph Della Fave, executive director of the Ironbound Community Corporation, said he was seeing more higher-income residents seeking help to pay for basics like electricity bills, and more clients seeking help for domestic violence. 
 ''Some of the families are picking up and moving back to the old country,'' Mr. Della Fave said. ''We've had 10 people this year return to South America.'' 
 In many neighborhoods, the problem caused by foreclosure may be underestimated, Ms. Newman said. 
 ''We are counting the number of names on mailboxes in heavily immigrant neighborhoods and what looks like a three-family house is actually a six-family house,'' she said. ''When those houses go into foreclosure it's not just the borrowers, it's also the renters living there who are left shuffling around.'' 
 The goal now is to get ahead of the problem, Mr. Pryor said. The city has changed its tax abatement rules to give developers an incentive to complete projects in danger of being abandoned. An abandoned property law has made it easier for the city to group pieces of land together for redevelopment as it has done with 12 city blocks in the city's West Ward. 
 City officials and nonprofit groups are fanning out into neighborhoods to tell residents that they do not have to vacate their homes as soon as foreclosure begins. The New Jersey Public Advocate's office announced last year that landlords who force tenants out because of foreclosure could face civil and criminal penalties.
 ''This is a situation where understanding your rights and the resources available to you can make a huge difference,'' said Stephanie Greenwood, coordinator of the Newark/Essex County Foreclosure Prevention Taskforce.
 Donald A. Baldyga Jr., director of real estate development for Episcopal Community Development, has applied to receive some of the $3.4 million to buy and repair foreclosed homes. He is using other funds to repair two foreclosed homes in the Clinton Hill section. 
 ''I want people to see something is happening,'' he said. ''What we are really saying is: 'Hold on. Help is coming.' ''

HEADLINE: His Kind of Shell-Shocked Town

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DeCURTIS

 BODY:
As cutbacks loom in every sector of New York City's economic life, the specter of the 1970s, with all of its deprivations and depredations, seems increasingly near as well. This being New York, of course, those days of near bankruptcy, graffiti-scarred subway cars, escalating crime rates and a dwindling population as the faint of heart fled to easier climes, evoke a fond nostalgia for some. 
 In the June issue of Vanity Fair, for example, the critic James Wolcott, who is working on a memoir of the decade, gleefully recalls a time when real New Yorkers could walk the streets with bravado while ''the tourists looked scared. Getting back to their hotel alive was one of the main items on their checklists.'' 
 Interestingly, that shell-shocked town is where John Lennon chose to make his home with his wife, Yoko Ono, in August 1971, as ''John Lennon: The New York City Years,'' an exhibition at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Annex in SoHo, documents. ''New York is the greatest place on earth,'' Lennon insisted with the enthusiasm of an out-of-towner who has just unhinged his jaw to chomp his first deli sandwich. For all his worldliness as an artist, Lennon had led a sheltered life as a member of the Beatles, shuttling from hotels to concert halls to airplanes when the band was on tour, and living isolated in the suburban ''stockbroker belt'' outside London when in England. 
 So he embraced the heady freedom New York offered, leaving his mop-top past behind like a new arrival from a small town, eager to become who he wanted to be. New Yorkers, in turn, saw the city anew through his wide, endlessly appreciative eyes. Sadly, such open-heartedness would prove his undoing in a town that proved tougher than he ever imagined it could be. 
 In a way that would be unthinkable now for one of the most famous men in the world, Lennon and Ono rented a two-room apartment on Bank Street in the West Village when they settled here, and bought bicycles to get around town. As a student at Sarah Lawrence and an avant-garde artist in New York in the 1950s and '60s, Ono was intimately familiar with the city. ''She made me walk around the streets and parks and squares and examine every nook and cranny,'' Lennon said. ''In fact you could say I fell in love with New York on a street corner.'' 
 His proximity to the docks and the meatpacking district reminded Lennon of his hometown port city of Liverpool, as did the characteristic gruffness of New Yorkers. ''I like New Yorkers because they have no time for the niceties of life,'' he said. ''They're like me in this. They're naturally aggressive, they don't believe in wasting time.'' 
 When the Nixon administration used a minor drug conviction in England as a pretext for kicking the politically outspoken Lennon out of the country, the city rallied behind him. The Hall of Fame exhibition includes a letter from Mayor John V. Lindsay to the Immigration and Naturalization Service recounting Lennon's charitable and artistic contributions to New York and requesting that he be permitted to stay. 
 Lennon and Ono broke up for a time in 1973, after which he mostly lived in Los Angeles. In 1975, after the couple had reunited, the government dropped its case and Lennon got his green card (also on display in the exhibition). And after three miscarriages, Ono gave birth to their son, Sean, that year. ''I feel higher than the Empire State Building,'' Lennon declared.
 By this time, the family was living in the Dakota on 72nd Street and Central Park West, a step up from Bank Street but hardly as posh then as it would eventually become. As the city struggled to recover from its economic crisis, Lennon established a domestic life. He stopped making albums, turned over his business affairs to Ono, and famously baked bread and cared for Sean. 
 By the time the couple began working on the album ''Double Fantasy'' in 1980, life in New York seemed to be on firmer -- and safer -- footing, though it was still raw enough that in 1979 Lennon and Ono donated $1,000 to purchase bullet-proof vests for the city's police force.
 Lennon was eager to return to public life, and he was still singing the praises of his adopted city. ''I can go right out this door now and go in a restaurant,'' he told a BBC reporter on Dec. 6, 1980, in an interview to promote the album's release. ''You want to know how great that is?'' 
 Two days later, Lennon was shot to death outside the Dakota. He was 40 years old. He had just returned home from a recording session with Ono and, rather than have their car pull directly into the Dakota's driveway, he got out at the curb so that he could greet the fans waiting outside. It was an emotionally generous gesture, maybe even a naive one: trusting the city too much, underestimating its dangers.
 Mick Jagger, a far more jaded New York transplant, couldn't believe his friend used to take cabs, which is ''probably to be avoided if you've got more than $10,'' as he said years later. 
 In the nearly three decades since Lennon's death, New York has often seemed like two cities: one where the famous and wealthy played in a luxurious bubble, and the other grittier world where everybody else lived. During his time in the city, John Lennon tried to act as if those worlds could be bridged. New York is safer now, statistics say. But underestimating the dangers ahead may still prove a fatal mistake.

HEADLINE: To Reclaim More Space And Save More Americana

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI. 
E-mail: conn@nytimes.com

DATELINE: Branford 

 BODY:
 YOU'D need a 19th-century map to locate the town green in many Connecticut communities, as they've been smeared with asphalt or lost in a thicket of high-rises. In other places, like Guilford, or Essex, you can make a wrong turn off the main thoroughfare, see the expanse of lawn and the old buildings, and feel like you've found the town's commercial and communal soul.
 Town greens, first cleared by settlers to graze cattle, drill militia and bury the dead, were later groomed into leafy meeting grounds after the Civil War. They now endure not so much as a matter of luck as stubbornness, as successions of town leaders in many communities have decided the open space is better used for more roads or parking spaces or commercial development. 
 Now comes Anthony DaRos, known as Unk, Branford's first selectman, who wants to make his town's green more welcoming to people, and less welcoming to cars, by replacing big chunks of asphalt with grass. But some voters, at least, are suggesting that any change is too much.
 Branford's town green is split by roads and occupied by three churches, one ancient assembly house and the Town Hall. The central gathering area along Main Street -- what most people would think of as the green -- is a meadow roughly the size of a football field, and pinched on one side by roads and driveways approaching the First Congregational Church.
 The resulting traffic gives Branford's green more of a transitory feel than, say, the one in neighboring Guilford, where families spend sunny days picnicking, pushing strollers and tossing Frisbees.
 Mr. DaRos wants to remove much of the pavement in front of the Congregational Church, replace it with an open grassy area, and place a sidewalk on the Green's opposite side so visitors can walk a 1-kilometer loop if they wish. The result would be a more people-friendly place, as well as a landscape better suited to what he called the nobility of the Town Hall and the Congregational Church.
 ''Look out there yourself,'' Mr. DaRos told a reporter during a recent visit to his office, which overlooks the green. ''It looks like a giant octopus with all that asphalt going in all directions, cars coming and going with no rhyme or reason.''
 A few months ago at a public hearing, Mr. DaRos presented his plan, which, at the time, also included a new roundabout and other roadway changes. He says he expected resistance. He was right. ''A lot of them said, 'It ain't broke, why fix it,' '' Mr. DaRos said. ''To me, it's broke.''
 Mr. DaRos dropped the idea of the roundabout and added a new parking lot nearby to placate those who worry about the loss of parking spaces. But two pillars of the original idea, the new grassy area near the church, and the long sidewalk, remain in ''Plan B,'' which he will unveil next month at another public hearing.
 Mr. DaRos's initiative may not threaten to cleave this shoreline town of 29,000 residents. But his effort sheds light on a small-town institution where some of suburbia's more profound changes are playing out -- the disappearance of mom-and-pop stores in the town center, a vaguely weakened sense of community -- and raises the question of whether a vibrant town green can perhaps mitigate those changes. 
 Not that such stuff has yet been a prominent part of the debate about Branford's green. 
 Jane Peterson Bouley, Branford's town historian, opposes the plan even though it may result in more grass. The new sidewalk is unnecessary, she said, and the entire idea feels forced. ''It seems innocent enough,'' she said, ''but you multiply these little changes through decades, and suddenly you have this mishmash of concrete, blacktop, brick and granite, with no plan.''
 Merchants around the green are less bothered by the proposal, even if it means the loss of eight precious parking spots.
 Wendi Streeto, manager of the Towne Pharmacy and a Branford native, watches the Green six days a week through broad storefront windows. She said fewer nearby parking spaces could affect her elderly customers in particular, but she likes the idea of expanding the grassy area and adding a sidewalk, because it could bring more families.
 ''The people that congregate on the Green the most tend to be high school age ne'er-do-wells,'' she said.
 Two major events -- the Branford Festival in June and the library book sale in the fall -- attract the masses, but otherwise Ms. Streeto said the Green's most interesting activity is ''parallel parking theater,'' where drivers struggle mightily to angle into a spot.
 Instead of heading to the Green's open space, most drivers end up in the local stores or Town Hall, she said. Not that the Green's merchants are thriving. Four have closed in the past year, as consumers have fled specialty stores for a Wal-Mart up the street. 
 A few doors away from Ms. Streeto, at Branford Book & Card Shoppe, Sal Esposito, an owner, said changes to the Green may not help local businesses so much during this national recession. ''We cherish the Green, and we want to preserve it as much as possible, but when people lose their jobs, they don't get dressed up and come down here for the paper and cigarettes,'' he said. ''They'll just stay at home and read it online.''
 Mr. DaRos said unless he finds consensus on the plan for the Green, he will not act. Besides, with a tight budget, the town would have to wait for federal or state aid anyway.
 If it sounds like a long-term project, that would suit Mr. DaRos. A mason by training, he grew up helping his father and uncles pull 24-ton slabs of pink granite from the town's Stony Creek quarry. Now if he can only persuade voters to hoist his giant slab of an idea, it might eventually be carved into something that will last for generations to come.

HEADLINE: Foreclosures Rise, With No End in Sight

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY and JANET ROBERTS

DATELINE: BRIDGEPORT 

 BODY:
 FOR Sandra and Curtis Davis, one of their most vivid memories is the blustery October afternoon in 1998 when they moved into their two-story clapboard colonial on a tree-lined street here. Ms. Davis said that they were ''over the moon happy'' about ''finally putting down roots.''
 These days, they are grappling with an equally vivid nightmare: that the sheriff will knock on their door and announce that the bank is their new landlord. 
 For nearly two years since they got their first foreclosure notice, the Davises said, they have been trying to hold onto their home. The latest effort was to file for bankruptcy to buy themselves time to renegotiate their debt, a move they made after learning that their home was scheduled to be put up for auction for a third time. 
 ''This could have been solved a long time ago,'' Ms. Davis, 41, a registered nurse who works at a nursing home in Stamford, said on a recent weekday morning, sitting on her worn, tan dining room carpet while pulling manila folders and foreclosure handbooks from a green trash bag. ''Our hands are really tied right now.'' 
 More than 27,000 homes in Fairfield, Hartford, Litchfield and New Haven Counties were in some stage of foreclosure between January 2005 and August 2008, according to an analysis by The New York Times of data from the Warren Group. These counties have fared better than other parts of the New York metropolitan area. Their 3.3 percent average foreclosure rate falls below New York City's rate of 4.6 percent and Long Island's 3.7 percent rate.
 However, there are indications that the foreclosure crisis could be worsening in Connecticut, based on statewide data on mortgage delinquencies showing that in March, 4.8 percent of the mortgages held by Connecticut homeowners were at least 90 days past due. That is up from 2.7 percent a year earlier. 
 This gives Connecticut the 13th-highest delinquency rate among the 50 states, according to First American CoreLogic, which collects data on about 85 percent of the nation's residential mortgages. Connecticut's rate is about the same as New York State's and below New Jersey's and far below the rate in Florida, where more than one in five homeowners are behind.
 But Connecticut has its share of foreclosure problems, spreading through its cities and touching its wealthier suburbs. 
 Just as occurred elsewhere in the region, the analysis of foreclosure data in Fairfield, Litchfield, Hartford and New Haven Counties shows that neighborhoods with large numbers of minority homeowners have been hit hardest. These are the same neighborhoods where bank data shows a high level of subprime lending practices in recent years. In the four counties studied by The Times, census tracts with mostly black or Hispanic populations had foreclosure rates more than triple the rate in mostly white areas.
 The cities of Bridgeport, New Haven, Waterbury and Hartford accounted for roughly one-fourth of the foreclosures in the four counties during the 44 months The Times analyzed. Though pockets of all four cities have recorded some of the worst foreclosure rates in the region, politicians and housing counselors call Bridgeport the epicenter of the foreclosure crisis in the state. More than 7 percent of homes in the city have been in foreclosure since 2005.
 Wealthier, mostly white suburbs have not been immune to the crisis. Detailed mapping analysis by The Times shows that the rate of foreclosures has increased in New Milford, Canaan and Torrington. Delinquency rates in those areas also have increased -- by 50 percent or more in the past year. 
 ''I see foreclosures in all of the towns in the judicial district,'' said Judge Douglas C. Mintz of Superior Court for the Stamford Norwalk Judicial District, who presides over the foreclosure docket in Stamford. ''There's certainly foreclosures occurring everywhere.''
 But there are also thousands of Connecticut residents who are struggling to keep up appearances and technically avoid foreclosure. Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said he is finding that his office struggles to get ashamed homeowners to admit that they have become victims of fraud. They hold a ''general perception about wealth'' that they shouldn't have money troubles, Mr. Blumenthal said.
 In many cases, the state's wealthier residents manage to avoid foreclosure by enlisting lawyers early in the process. Eileen Pate, a Greenwich-based lawyer, represents one family who fell into foreclosure after using their home to finance their two children's Ivy League educations. She is helping them negotiate an agreement with their bank to modify the loan. 
 Then there are wealthy residents who are resorting to short sales -- selling their houses, under an agreement with their lenders, for less than the amount of the mortgages -- to avoid foreclosure and destroying their credit. 
 Burt M. Hoffman, a Stamford-based lawyer, said he had been inundated by builders, investment bankers and corporate executives trying to do short sales of homes with mortgages worth more than $2.5 million each in the past two months. During the same time last year, he said, he did not have any deals for mortgages exceeding $1 million. He said homes in Greenwich, Darien and New Canaan are ''sustaining the most severe impact.'' 
 The state has taken some recent steps with immediate fixes like foreclosure counseling and longer-term solutions like job training programs, State Senator Bob Duff of Norwalk said. But he said that many of these programs had been overwhelmed by the number of people who now are unemployed and struggling to pay their mortgages. 
 The Obama administration has only recently put together the pieces of its two-month old plan to help homeowners avoid foreclosures and so it is too early to say what impact the program may have here.
 For now, many foreclosure counselors and agencies said they did not have enough resources to help all of the homeowners seeking help and they had trouble keeping up with changing programs and regulations. 
 Joan Carty, president and chief executive of the Stamford-based Housing Development Fund, said it is especially difficult because many Connecticut residents did not have standard government loans backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Instead, many of them took out private loans that enabled them to take out larger mortgages. 
 For some homeowners, it has been a challenge to get help after foreclosure. Tiffany Hinson, 37, said she went into foreclosure on her four-bedroom ranch in Manchester in late 2007 after she fell behind on her mortgage because she had missed work after her divorce. She first hired an agency for $1,700 to help her negotiate with her bank, but it was shut down by a federal investigation, and Ms. Hinson fell behind even more.
 Then she contacted a foreclosure counseling group that she said she found through the state's foreclosure hot line. The group was supposed to restructure her mortgage, but she said her counselor sent the paperwork to the wrong fax number and the courts technically foreclosed on her home in February. After contacting several local politicians and working with Neighborhood Housing Services of New Haven, Ms. Hinson said she was finally able to get her home out of foreclosure.
 She said she is now waiting for her lender, Aurora Loan Services, to accept her mortgage payments again. 
 ''You don't have to sit back and let your home be taken away,'' Ms. Hinson said. ''It just makes me sad that people don't know.''
 The Davises, who have six children ranging in age from 5 to 18, acknowledge that choices they made over the years contributed to their financial problems. Their original monthly mortgage payment on the four-bedroom house, which they bought for $101,000 in 1998, was $956 -- a payment they easily managed on Ms. Davis's salary as a nurse and Mr. Davis's job at the Clairol plant. But in 2004 and 2006 they took out additional mortgages to finance car payments and pay off dental bills, ultimately consolidating the debt into a $1,500-a-month adjustable rate loan. 
 They fell behind after illnesses in 2005 forced them to take time off work, and their interest rate rose to 11.2 percent in 2006. Ms. Davis said they could not keep up with plans that raised the payments to roughly $3,500 a month. Records show that Wells Fargo started foreclosure proceedings in February 2007.
 The Davises said they have tried a succession of strategies to renegotiate their loan. In August 2007, they contacted the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America in Jamaica Plain, Mass., which submitted an application to modify their loan. Darren Duarte, a spokesman for the group, said the Davises's servicer, HomEq, did not cooperate. Brandon Ashcraft, a spokesman for HomEq, said that its recidivism rates track well below those reported by the larger industry.
 Next, the Davises said, they contacted Julissa Soto, a housing counselor with the housing advocacy group Acorn in Bridgeport. According to the Davises, Ms. Soto told them that if they sent a $10,000 ''good-faith'' payment, the bank would give them a deal starting at $2,813 a month with an 11 percent interest rate. 
 But the Davises declined to pay that much money, fearing they would need the money if they had to move. Ms. Soto did not respond to telephone calls or e-mail messages. 
 Finally, the Davises hired Gary Seymour, a bankruptcy lawyer, who told HomEq its good-faith payment demand was too high. Mr. Ashcraft said that it is standard for HomEq to request these payments.
 On Mr. Seymour's advice, the Davises filed for bankruptcy and sued their mortgage holder, Wells Fargo, arguing that it did not technically own the mortgage when it began foreclosure proceedings. 
 Ms. Davis has reached out to their families for help, but they, too are under financial stress. 
 ''They've been praying for us,'' Ms. Davis said. ''But nobody has any money. Everybody is pretty much struggling themselves.''

HEADLINE: Spring With a Flourish: Fresh Dishes Daily

BYLINE: By PATRICIA BROOKS

 BODY:
AFTER an economically austere winter, spring is a good time for a gastronomic splurge into the countryside. I opted to visit Winvian, a Relais & Chateau member and spa in Morris, outside Litchfield.
 At lunchtime we could enjoy the manicured grounds of this handsome 113-acre property, along with an a la carte menu that is less pricey than the prix fixe dinner. (We could also more easily see the entrance post's voice box, which opens the gate -- a light on the post would help at night.)
 Once indoors, we were led up a winding stairway to the second floor's main dining gallery. One wall was lined with five framed mirrors, the opposite wall with windows offering airy views. 
 The lunch menu is short because, I was told, everything is made fresh and changes daily. This was obvious in the ethereal crunchy-crusted warm rolls and starters of freshly made minestrone and sprightly chickpea salad in a bonnet of lightly dressed greens. 
 As an entree, roast Bershire pork loin with a crusty-edged polenta cake and caponata was perfectly cooked -- a touch beyond rare -- and very flavorful. Scottish salmon with a sweet piperade of onions, peppers and tomatoes was also nicely done. A third entree -- handmade ricotta and chive ravioli with butter and sage -- was delicate, but a tad anemic.
 Desserts came with a flourish: satiny sour cream cheesecake with blueberry compote; a selection of three European cheeses (listed under entrees, but generous enough to serve two as dessert); and assorted fruit sorbets and ice creams. 
 For dinner our foursome had a private dining room, our table set in front of a roaring fire. Two full-length portraits faced us: one was of Winthrop Smith, known as Win, the other of his wife, Vivien, known as Vian -- the namesakes and onetime owners of the property and the forebears of the proprietors. 
 The menu offered three appetizers and three entrees. All three starters were competently prepared, but none elicited the ''Wow!'' reaction we hoped for. Winter salad had intriguing ingredients -- smoked ''Pekin duck,'' baby beets, grilled fennel slivers and pecan halves -- but wasn't quite integrated as a salad. Pate en croute (a duck terrine with lentil salad and cornichons) and nocchette (''handmade black pasta'' with shrimp, tomato and parsley) were also pleasing, if not memorable.
 As an entree, I looked forward to an old favorite, rarely, if ever, seen on Connecticut menus -- bstilla. I have enjoyed this sweet pigeon pie many times in Morocco and have made it at home, using Cornish game hen instead of pigeon. An eggy, almost custardy, interior containing bits of pigeon, almonds and sweet spices, it is swaddled in layers of phyllo crust. At Winvian the dish consisted of several large chunks of dark, dense red meat (the consistency of beef heart), tough and all but impossible to swallow, encased, with spinach, in a single crisp wrapper. The almonds, cinnamon, ginger, allspice, sugar and layering that make this pie unique were missing, and the ''garnishes'' were gratuitous: bits of foie gras, a poached quail egg and swirls of al dente spaghetti squash.
 The two other entrees were less controversial. Roasted mahi-mahi with saffron-scented quinoa pilaf was subtle and well cooked. An ample, chewy veal loin chop arrived with polenta, carrots and cipollini -- compatible if unexciting.
 Desserts were the evening's high point. Each diner was served two mini-desserts, each different from the others. Two plates of petit fours also arrived. We sampled and enjoyed everything in sight, especially the chocolate souffle, cheesecake and coconut-pineapple mousse. Overkill maybe, but a delicious one. A choice of brewed loose tea (no bags) made an appreciated finale.
 Included gratuitously were an amuse-bouche, a refreshing Poire William sorbet served between starter and entree and petit fours. The evening was so relaxed, the wine selection excellent and the youthful staff members so eager to please, that we forgave the pigeon mishap and reveled in the total experience. But if bstilla is on the menu, consider yourself forewarned.

HEADLINE: Diminished Returns

BYLINE: By NIALL FERGUSON. 
Niall Ferguson is a professor at Harvard University and the Harvard Business School and the author most recently of ''The Ascent of Money: A Financial History of the World.''

 BODY:
If financial crises were distributed along a bell curve -- like traffic accidents or people's heights -- really big ones wouldn't happen very often. When the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management lost 44 percent of its value in August 1998, its managers were flabbergasted. According to their value-at-risk models, a loss of this magnitude in a single month was so unlikely that it ought never to have happened in the entire life of the universe. Just over a decade later, many more of us now know what it's like to lose 44 percent of our money. Even after the recent stock-market rally, that's about how much the Standard & Poor's 500 index is down compared with October 2007. 
 Financial crises will happen. In the 1340s, a sovereign-debt crisis wiped out the leading Florentine banks of Bardi, Peruzzi and Acciaiuoli. Between December 1719 and December 1720, the price of shares in John Law's Mississippi Company fell 90 percent. Such crashes can also happen to real estate: in Japan, property prices fell by more than 60 percent during the '90s. 
 For reasons to do with human psychology and the failure of most educational institutions to teach financial history, we are always more amazed when such things happen than we should be. As a result, 9 times out of 10 we overreact. The usual response is to introduce a raft of new laws and regulations designed to prevent the crisis from repeating itself. In the months ahead, the world will reverberate to the sound of stable doors being shut long after the horses have bolted, and history suggests that many of the new measures will do more harm than good. The classic example is the legislation passed during the British South-Sea Bubble to restrict the formation of joint-stock companies. The so-called Bubble Act of 1720 remained a needless handicap on the British economy for more than a century. 
 Human beings are as good at devising ex post facto explanations for big disasters as they are bad at anticipating those disasters. It is indeed impressive how rapidly the economists who failed to predict this crisis -- or predicted the wrong crisis (a dollar crash) -- have been able to produce such a satisfying story about its origins. Yes, it was all the fault of deregulation. 
 There are just three problems with this story. First, deregulation began quite a while ago (the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act was passed in 1980). If deregulation is to blame for the recession that began in December 2007, presumably it should also get some of the credit for the intervening growth. Second, the much greater financial regulation of the 1970s failed to prevent the United States from suffering not only double-digit inflation in that decade but also a recession (between 1973 and 1975) every bit as severe and protracted as the one we're in now. Third, the continental Europeans -- who supposedly have much better-regulated financial sectors than the United States -- have even worse problems in their banking sector than we do. The German government likes to wag its finger disapprovingly at the ''Anglo Saxon'' financial model, but last year average bank leverage was four times higher in Germany than in the United States. Schadenfreude will be in order when the German banking crisis strikes.
 We need to remember that much financial innovation over the past 30 years was economically beneficial, and not just to the fat cats of Wall Street. New vehicles like hedge funds gave investors like pension funds and endowments vastly more to choose from than the time-honored choice among cash, bonds and stocks. Likewise, innovations like securitization lowered borrowing costs for most consumers. And the globalization of finance played a crucial role in raising growth rates in emerging markets, particularly in Asia, propelling hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. 
 The reality is that crises are more often caused by bad regulation than by deregulation. For one thing, both the international rules governing bank-capital adequacy so elaborately codified in the Basel I and Basel II accords and the national rules administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission failed miserably. It was the Basel system of weighting assets by their supposed riskiness that essentially allowed the Enronization of banks' balance sheets, so that (for example) the ratio of Citigroup's tangible on- and off-balance-sheet assets to its common equity reached a staggering 56 to 1 last year. The good health of Canada's banks is due to better regulation. Simply by capping leverage at 20 to 1, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions spared Canada the need for bank bailouts. 
 The biggest blunder of all had nothing to do with deregulation. For some reason, the Federal Reserve convinced itself that it could focus exclusively on the prices of consumer goods instead of taking asset prices into account when setting monetary policy. In July 2004, the federal funds rate was just 1.25 percent, at a time when urban property prices were rising at an annual rate of 17 percent. Negative real interest rates at this time were arguably the single most important cause of the property bubble. 
 All of these were sins of commission, not omission, by Washington, and some at least were not unrelated to the very considerable political contributions and lobbying expenditures of the financial sector. Taxpayers, therefore, should beware. It is more than a little convenient for America's political class to blame deregulation for this financial crisis and the resulting excesses of the free market. Not only does that neatly pass the buck, but it also creates a justification for . . . more regulation. The old Latin question is highly apposite here: Quis custodiet ipsos custodes? -- Who regulates the regulators? Until that question is answered, calls for more regulation are symptoms of the very disease they purport to cure.

HEADLINE: In a Recession, There's Still Sidewalk Chic

 BODY:
For sellers, holding a garage sale is a way to make a little extra money and do some spring cleaning and purging at the same time. For buyers, the garage sale taps into that universal desire to score a bargain. All motives are in keeping with the current recessionary spirit, and last weekend garage buyers and sellers were out in force in places like League City, Tex. (near Houston), and Brooklyn where they are known as stoop sales, garages being in short supply.

HEADLINE: Losing the Income, And the Camaraderie

BYLINE: By CATHERINE BERGART. 
E-mail: preoccupations@nytimes.com

 BODY:
I WAS around No. 1,892,450 of the 2,111,000 people who lost their jobs in the United States last October. It happened near the end of the month. I wasn't new to layoffs -- my first one was in 2001 -- but this was different. This time, I not only lost my income, but also I lost the day-to-day camaraderie of a particularly close group of colleagues. 
 ''The Great Good Place,'' a book by the urban sociologist Ray Oldenburg, talks about the social and psychological importance of what he calls ''third places.'' He designates home as ''first place'' and work as ''second place.'' He describes ''third place'' as somewhere neutral, convenient, comfortable and welcoming. It's where regulars gather and where conversation is lively, engaging and often accompanied by laughter. Soda fountains, beer gardens, cafes and Main Streets have traditionally functioned as third places. 
 But with a dearth of cozy public gathering spots in America today, I was lucky to have found my third place right inside my second place. 
 Five days a week, I spent time with my colleagues. Most days, we chatted over morning coffee, hung out at lunch and indulged in more late-afternoon guffaws than management might have liked.
 In one of our more serious conversations, we compared notes on how we had each fallen into advertising, never having set out to work in that field. One woman who has a graduate degree in psychology went on to say: ''I used to fantasize about escaping this business and finding something I truly love to do. In this economy, however, my only hope is to keep the job I have.'' 
 My co-workers and I were a disparate group. While we were all advertising copywriters, we covered a range of ages and lifestyles, and it's unlikely we would have met socially. That's one of the charms of third places: they expand your possibilities. Forging connections with people outside your usual circle gives you a broader sense of community. And of belonging.
 I stay in contact with my former colleagues through e-mail, instant messaging, and the occasional phone call. I also joined Facebook, but none of it is the same. Without the shared time, week in and week out, it's hard to find the loose threads of conversation that dangled in the air among us.
 Our communications have become more like a series of polite inquiries: ''How was your weekend?'', ''Is your husband over the flu yet?'', ''Did you hear that Deb found a new job?''
 These days, I spend most of my time at home. When I was first laid off, I sent out resumes and made networking calls, but when many of the other ad agencies turned to layoffs, too, I realized that my job prospects were limited. I became, by default, a freelance writer. 
 Now, my first place is also my second place. I negotiate freelance gigs by e-mail, and if I need background materials for a project, my clients send them to me digitally. I use e-mail and the phone to communicate. Working from home, I lack not only the third-place socializing I used to enjoy with my congenial coworkers, but I also miss out on the basic human contact that usually comes standard in a second place.
 As Mr. Oldenburg wrote in The Planning Commissioners Journal, ''Social well-being and psychological health depend upon community.'' Having a third place, along with a first and second, he says, ''suggests the stability of the tripod in contrast to the relative instability of the bipod.'' What would he make, I wonder, of my monopod existence?
 Of course, there are benefits to working from home. I save on gasoline and can stay in my pajamas all day -- and my dog adores having me there.
 But I, too, am a social animal, and the lack of human interaction -- aside from the one-on-one kind I share with my husband in the evenings -- is starting to take its toll. In addition to the loneliness, I'm finding it harder to maintain a sense of perspective, and humor, about my life, and when I am finally in a group situation, I feel out of practice and like the shy kid I used to be.
 In an effort to create a better balance for myself, I've tried taking my laptop to Starbucks. I know from its marketing materials that it seeks to be a third place, but I've found that no matter how many people are sitting there drinking coffee and tapping away at their computers, the experience is essentially solitary. With little wit, laughter or lively, engaging conversation among regulars -- and no free coffee -- it bears little resemblance to my ex-office. 
 RECENTLY, I heard about a new way for people like me to deal with their second- and third-place needs. It's called ''co-working.'' The idea is that someone sets up an office space and then rents out desks. For a modest fee, you get a quiet place to work, big-office amenities -- copier, printer, microwave and free coffee or tea -- and an instant community. Everyone works independently, but you have the opportunity to share ideas and socialize. Co-working seems to be catching on around the country, and I'm hoping that a space will open soon near me.
 More than five million people have been laid off in the United States since December 2007, so I know I'm not alone. While that makes me no less lonely, it does suggest that there are hordes of people out there who, like me, have suffered from a double loss: their income, as well a place that provided a special form of social nourishment.

HEADLINE: Women's Golf Today: Nice Work, if You Can Get It

BYLINE: By KAREN CROUSE

 BODY:
The golfer Janice Moodie is a two-time winner on the L.P.G.A. Tour with earnings of more than $3 million in 11 years. She occupies the highest rung on the playing priority ladder. 
 But after finishing 64th on the 2008 money list, Moodie, like many players on the tour, finds herself scrambling for work. Through the first four months of the year, she played in six L.P.G.A. events, her number of potential paydays slashed because of a shrinking tournament schedule and a slightly higher percentage of events restricted to fewer players. 
 For the first time since Moodie, 35, was a teenager moonlighting at a supermarket and a sporting goods store in her native Scotland, she feels as if she were doing provisional work.
 ''I do feel like a part-time golfer,'' she said. 
 This week's Sybase Classic in Clifton, N.J., is the ninth stop of 2009 for the women's tour. By comparison, the PGA Tour is in Texas this week for its 21st event in 19 weeks. 
 With their tour's smaller television presence and lighter schedule, the women have not had the same reach in professional golf as the men even in the best of times. This year, with many of the sport's core sponsors in finance, real estate development and luxury automobiles reeling, the L.P.G.A. has scrambled to fill its schedule. The PGA Tour is down one full-field event, and the women's tour has lost five, to 29 from 34 in 2008, and is in danger of losing more.
 The L.P.G.A. players are like furloughed workers, taking weeks off without pay. Brittany Lincicome won her first major, the Kraft Nabisco Championship, in April. She pulled out the victory dramatically with an eagle on the last hole, yet in terms of corralling momentum it was like lassoing air.
 The tour went dark for the next two weeks and three of the next four. Lincicome has played twice since her Kraft Nabisco victory on April 5; she missed the cut three weeks later in Mexico, and tied for 63rd last weekend in Virginia. 
 Kristy McPherson, who finished a stroke behind Lincicome at the Nabisco, said: ''It's tough when you can't really get into a rhythm. I'm one of those players that always feels like I play better at the end of a stretch, but unfortunately we haven't had too many of those.''
 As the golf season nears the turn, the L.P.G.A. is staring at a tough lie, one that will require all of its skill and ingenuity to negotiate. What can the tour do when it has more talent and fewer tournaments? 
 ''Well, I think it's not good to panic,'' said Lorena Ochoa, the top-ranked player. ''We're playing for less money, but it's not about the money. I think we are in a time that we need to support the tour.'' 
 Cristie Kerr conquered the wind to win the Michelob Ultra Open in Williamsburg, Va., last weekend as rumors swirled that there would be no tournament there for her to defend in 2010. 
 ''That disturbs me,'' she said afterward. ''I tried to tell them on TV, you need to come back, or whoever it is, because we need to have a tournament here.'' 
 After 31 years, the L.P.G.A. Corning Classic will crown its final champion this month. The L.P.G.A. was willing to work with the tournament to keep it afloat, but after announcing plans to let go about 13 percent of its global workforce, Corning Inc., the title sponsor since 1979, could not justify clinging to the partnership. 
 ''As much as I hate to see the tournament go away, I think it is the right decision,'' said Dawn Marie Castellana, the tournament director. 
 In the late 1970s and 1980s, the L.P.G.A. planted seeds in small towns like Corning, N.Y., and Hershey, Pa., and watched women's golf blossom. Since the 1990s, it has become a worldwide enterprise, the mom-and-pop connection gradually giving way to a cosmopolitan vibe. 
 The face of the L.P.G.A. during that period of expansion belonged to a Swede, Annika Sorenstam, who was supplanted in 2007 by Ochoa, who is from Mexico. In recent years, South Koreans have become a force, occupying 17 of the top 50 spots on this week's money list. 
 The L.P.G.A. has entered a television partnership with J Golf, the South Korean equivalent of the Golf Channel. Starting next year, the tour will team with the Golf Channel, which already carries PGA, Nationwide and Champions Tour men's events. But for now, the L.P.G.A. Tour is without a United States broadcast partner, which has created gaps in its exposure.
 Two elite players, Ochoa and Suzann Pettersen of Norway, engaged in a stirring duel last month in Mexico that was not televised in the United States. Golf fans in this country missed seeing Ochoa hold off Pettersen for her 26th career L.P.G.A. victory. 
 The tour lost Sorenstam to retirement this year but gained an infusion of new blood. At No. 3 on the money list is Jiyai Shin, a 20-year-old from South Korea who has four L.P.G.A. victories, including a major, since August. Michelle Wie, now 19, is in her first year as a card-carrying tour member after contending for titles since age 13. 
 Wie is the most recognizable United States player, though not the most distinguished. Leading an American resurgence is Kerr, who sits atop the money list. She is joined in the top 10 by two of her compatriots, Angela Stanford and Lincicome. 
 ''We currently have an extremely deep pool of talented players,'' the tour's commissioner, Carolyn Bivens, wrote in an e-mail message. ''And our top golfers are committed to playing more than ever this year in order to support the tour, tournaments, sponsors and our fans during a recession that has affected every business, industry and family.''
 She added, ''We're fighting every day for economic empowerment for all our members and would like nothing more than to provide tournament-playing opportunities for more golfers.'' 
 Kerr, Stanford, Lincicome and Wie are entered in the Sybase Classic, which has a field worthy of a major championship. Consider it the upside to fewer events. 
 The jockeying for position on the money list will become more intense as spring gives way to summer. After the United States Open in July, there will be a one-week break and six limited-field events down the stretch. Golfers who do not qualify for the no-cut tournaments in Asia will lose more ground. 
 ''It seems like every year it's just getting tougher and tougher to work your way in,'' said Reilley Rankin, a sixth-year pro who is No. 80 on the money list. 
 The choices for those left out of limited-field events will be few: move down a step to play on the Duramed Futures Tour or catch up with loved ones. Some caddies on the tour have looked into carrying clubs on the side at country clubs in New York and Florida. 
 During the L.P.G.A.'s spring break, the 24-year-old pro Minea Blomqvist of Finland caddied for her boyfriend, Roope Kakko, who plays on the European Tour. Rankin spent more time with her family than she had since high school. 
 ''You can complain about it or you can accept it,'' she said. ''At this point, we're grateful to have tournaments.''

HEADLINE: Foreclosures Rise, With No End in Sight

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER and JANET ROBERTS

DATELINE: MOUNT VERNON 

 BODY:
 THE room was filled with people in trouble or about to be, and the fact that they were in the city's public library was bitterly fitting. The library is on South First Avenue, a street that is the epicenter of Westchester's foreclosure crisis, with at least 27 homes on just four blocks in various stages of foreclosure over the past several years.
 The occasion was a workshop run by a nonprofit group called Community Housing Innovations, aimed at educating people about their options in grappling with foreclosure. Andrea Moody, a soft-spoken 45-year-old account manager and single mother of two teenagers, was there to take notes because it has been three months since she made a full $2,600 mortgage payment to Chase Manhattan. 
 ''I don't want to lose my home,'' Ms. Moody said afterward. ''My dad had it, and it was a source of pride to him, and it hurts me to think I could lose it.'' 
 She or her parents have owned the three-family house in Mount Vernon for 40 years and regularly kept up with the mortgage payments. But, like many modest-income owners of two- and three-family homes, Ms. Moody began having problems with a longtime tenant -- damaged walls and floors, fights to which the police had to be summoned -- and her plight was aggravated by bad luck and a bad economy. 
 She finally got the tenants to leave a year and half ago. But the cost of repairing the damage while paying the mortgage, coupled with the mess left by a contractor who went bankrupt, leaving an unfinished apartment that is hard to rent, has proved too much for Ms. Moody. So she kept her ears peeled for ways Community Housing might help her modify the terms of her loan.
 Like Ms. Moody, thousands of homeowners across Westchester County, a synonym for suburban America, are trapped in mortgages whose monthly payments they cannot make. 
 A detailed examination by The New York Times of more than 182,000 homes in foreclosure around the region found that more than 4,400 Westchester County homes -- 2.3 percent of all residential properties -- were in some stage of foreclosure between January 2006 and August 2008. 
 What worries housing advocates is that more home owners are struggling. In March, 3 percent of Westchester County residential mortgages were at least 90 days past due, almost double the rate from the same time last year, according to preliminary data from First American CoreLogic, a real estate data firm.
 As the library meeting made clear, most foreclosures were concentrated in some of the poorest ZIP codes -- in pockets of Mount Vernon, Yonkers, Port Chester, Peekskill and White Plains. 
 But foreclosures were not confined to those places. Scarsdale had 95 properties in default; Pelham, 32; Rye, 30; Larchmont, 27; and Chappaqua, 22. A notice of default comes after nonpayment for 90 days and is the first step in the foreclosure process. 
 Compared to other counties in the region, including Suffolk and Nassau, Westchester's delinquency rate is among the lowest and pales in comparison with the hardest-hit areas, like Osceola, Lee and St. Lucie Counties in Florida, where more than one in five mortgages is past due. 
 Still, the foreclosure wallop has affected even vintage Westchester neighborhoods like the Rochelle Heights and Rochelle Park enclaves in New Rochelle, where the Tudors and colonials were built a century ago when the country's first bedroom communities were laid out and where homes not so long ago fetched a million dollars and more. Seven houses on Hamilton Avenue in those two neighborhoods are in various stages of being taken over or managed by banks, as are more than a dozen other of the enclaves' 350 homes, according to the analysis by The Times.
 Westchester's painful toll tells much about how widespread this decade's home-buying frenzy was. In too many cases, families took out mortgages or refinanced on payment terms that gave them only the thinnest margin for error and left no cushion for a plunging housing market.
 Nevertheless, The Times analysis shows that foreclosure has touched Westchester more lightly than other parts of the region. The foreclosure rate of 2.3 percent of all properties for the 32-month period analyzed is lower than the overall regional rate of 2.9 percent during that same period. Not surprisingly, higher-income communities experienced the lowest rates of foreclosures, and about one-third of Westchester ZIP codes, with median incomes of $100,000 or more in the 2000 census, fell into that category.
 Just as elsewhere in the region, the highest rates of foreclosure in the county were in neighborhoods with mostly black and Hispanic residents. . In mostly black census tracts, 11 percent of homes were in foreclosure -- more than seven times the rate for mostly white areas. In mostly Hispanic tracts, the rate was more than 8 percent, more than five times the rate in mostly white areas. 
 Nationally, a report issued Tuesday by the Pew Hispanic Center said that gains made in homeownership over the past decade by African-Americans and native-born Latinos were tied disproportionately to relaxed lending standards and subprime loans and that the gains had eroded faster in the downturn than those of whites.
 The banks listed on Westchester default notices include icons of the industry -- Deutsche Bank, Citicorp, Wells Fargo. But interviews with real-estate brokers, bankers and government officials indicate that the loans were often dangled by little-known mortgage brokers who received a commission for originating a loan on behalf of a bank whether the payment terms were realistic or not. 
 ''There were many of these mortgage brokers operating in neighborhoods, often in neighborhoods of color, taking advantage of people who wanted to get their piece of the American dream,'' said State Senator Jeffrey D. Klein, a Bronx Democrat who twice investigated subprime mortgages. ''Everyone would be O.K. since the property would be worth more than they paid for it.'' 
 Partly under pressure from the federal government to increase lending in low- and moderate-income areas, particularly in ''redlined'' black and Hispanic neighborhoods where banks had historically refused to lend, these banks themselves created new species of mortgages for people who might not easily pass an income verification or afford a 20 percent down payment.
 Mortgage brokers bore no risk if a homeowner defaulted. Big banks, too, seemed to shrug off the risk because they often resold the mortgages to other banks or packaged them into securities backed by pools of mortgages that included hundreds of more reliable borrowers. Together, these mortgage-backed securities were sold to even more detached investors because an ocean of American and foreign money was looking for high-yield investments. 
 When home prices started slipping as the economy stumbled in late 2007, some homeowners found that they owed more on a house than it was worth, so they could not refinance to rid themselves of exorbitant interest rates. 
 Senator Klein's October 2007 study of subprime lenders listed the top three banks that originated defaulted mortgages in Westchester as Fremont Investment and Loan, Dynamic Dwellings and Washington Mutual. The top three lenders who held the mortgages at the time of foreclosure were US Bank, Wells Fargo and Deutsche Bank.
 Anthony Marciano, owner of a local real estate brokerage, Century 21 Marciano, told of how four or five years ago mortgage brokers began enticing residents to refinance. In phone calls and fliers, he said, they urged residents to pull out the equity in their houses in order to buy other homes as investments or to pay for home renovations or college tuition. 
 ''They came in like vultures and are no longer around,'' Mr. Marciano said of the mortgage brokers, though he puts more blame on banks for letting brokers originate loans at seductive rates.
 Yet Brian Conway, an assistant district attorney in the Westchester County district attorney's office who spoke at the Mount Vernon foreclosure workshop, acknowledged in an interview that there had not been a single criminal indictment against fraudulent brokers or bankers in recent years. Many complaints the office gets, he said, end up being handled through civil litigation, though he urged those in the audience who suspect fraud to contact him.
 The Obama administration has only recently put together the pieces of its two-month-old plan to help homeowners avoid foreclosures. 
 The damage that foreclosure does to a neighborhood is evident on South First Avenue in Mount Vernon, where on a street lined with modest clapboards and stuccos with towel-sized front yards, 27 homes have been in various stages of foreclosure over the past several years, according to the data analyzed by The Times. Many of the owners are gone, with the doors padlocked, the windows sealed with plywood, the shrubbery collecting wind-blown advertising fliers.
 Neighbors indicate that in many cases the blue-collar homeowners had depended on rent from upstairs tenants who left or were fired or, in one case, shot to death. That is how narrow the margin of financial survival can be in the neighborhood.
 At the meeting at the Mount Vernon library, many of the two dozen people who attended had other reasons they could not make their payments. 
 Kwok Fay Hugh, 59, a carpenter and widowed father of two, said he had been overwhelmed by debt, including $28,000 in medical bills as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning. That made it difficult to keep up payments on an 8 percent subprime mortgage (there was no income verification) for his Cape-style home in Elmsford. 
 ''I'm not good with paperwork -- my wife took care of paperwork,'' he said of his wife, who died in 1996. ''I don't understand the mortgage stuff. I'm a simple person, a carpenter, that's it.''
 But he, Ms. Moody and the others took some consolation in one another's company.
 ''There are people out there who can help you, and you're not alone,'' Ms. Moody said. ''That was comforting.''

HEADLINE: Whatever You Call It, This Rally May Not Last

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a senior editor at Money magazine. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com

 BODY:
IS the bear market over?
 It may depend on which bear market you mean.
 According to one definition, a market shifts from bear to bull when it rises by 20 percent, and that occurred weeks ago. (Despite rocky trading last week, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed on Friday at 882.88, or 31 percent above its March 9 low.) 
 But by another definition, we may still be in a bear market -- a long-term decline, extending over many years, often called a ''secular bear market.'' The current rally could turn out to be short -- making it ''a cyclical bull market'' nestled inside a secular bear market. 
 That would not be cause for much celebration. It would mean that stocks might be stuck at current levels or even resume their downward spiral.
 Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, says she is inclined to take this view. While she thinks that the cyclical bear market that began in 2007 is over, she said, ''I'm still slightly leaning toward thinking that we are still in a secular bear.'' 
 We've been there before. In the period from 1966 to 1982, the S.& P. 500 was widely regarded as a secular bear market. That was followed by a secular bull market from 1982 to 1999, when stocks had a spectacular run-up. 
 But stocks fell into yet another secular bear nine years ago -- shortly after the tech-stock bubble burst in 2000. Despite some rallies, the S.& P. has fallen about 44 percent during this time.
 So how should we classify the recent rally? 
 It could be the start of a secular bull market, of course, but it's hard to say with certainty, because a new secular bull would require not only rising stock prices, but also new all-time inflation-adjusted highs in major stock indexes. That means the S.& P. 500 would have to climb to at least 1,890, which represents its March 2000 peak of 1,527, adjusted for inflation. 
 With the S.& P. now at 882.88, the market would have to soar an additional 114 percent -- on top of the 31 percent it has already climbed over the last two months.
 Such a surge could be quite a challenge. Robert D. Arnott, chairman of the investment consulting firm Research Affiliates, in Pasadena, Calif., is skeptical about the possibility of that happening anytime soon. ''I don't see any way that a new bull could reach new highs, adjusted for inflation, relative to the market's 2000 peak,'' he said. 
 He added that secular bull and bear markets have historically lasted 15 to 25 years. ''That would indicate we're still perhaps a decade away'' from the end of the secular bear, he said.
 Ms. Sonders of Schwab said there were several economic obstacles to reaching new market highs in the near future, including the potential for strong inflation after the flood of liquidity that central banks have pumped into the global economy. 
 If this rally turns out to be merely the start of a cyclical bull market, not a secular one, the implications for investors are gloomy.
 Jeffrey A. Hirsch, editor in chief of the Stock Trader's Almanac, studied both types of bulls and bears. He found that since World War II, cyclical bull markets born inside secular bears returned about 42 percent, on average, for the entire life of the rally. That's less than half the gains generated by cyclical bulls that formed within secular bull markets. What's more, it's not that much higher than the 31 percent that the S.& P. 500 has returned since March 9.
 Moreover, the average cyclical bull market within a secular bear has lasted 157 days, while cyclical bulls within secular bull markets have endured 342 days, on average.
 A modest recovery is exactly what many market strategists are bracing for -- not only for stock prices, but also for the economy in general. 
 Jack A. Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank in Chicago, says that while the economy is likely to rebound toward year-end, the recovery will be ''very slow and incremental as we need to repair 10 years of overspending and overborrowing.'' 
 Real gross domestic product -- economic activity adjusted for inflation -- has the potential to grow at around 3 percent a year, Mr. Ablin said. ''But I think we're going to grow below potential for several years.'' 
 Duncan W. Richardson, chief equity investment officer at Eaton Vance, the asset manager in Boston, agrees. ''We could be in store for a couple of years of below-trend growth,'' he said. 
 But that ''may not be such a bad thing,'' he added. Faster growth than that, he said, might fuel fears of inflation and cause the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner rather than later.
 STOCKS may face a somewhat similar pattern. 
 Jeremy Grantham, chairman of GMO, the investment management firm, said stocks ''will kick up much more impressively than the economy'' in the initial stages of the recovery.
 But he added that the market ''could then move sideways for a very long time.''

HEADLINE: Despite Some Good News, Stocks Tumble

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
After weeks of gains even when the economic news was bleak, the stock market dropped last week, pulling the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index back into negative territory for the year. 
 It wasn't that the economic data was particularly grim last week. There were, in fact, some positive signs, including a rise in the University of Michigan preliminary consumer sentiment index, to 67.9 in May from 65.1 in April. In November, the index fell as low as 55.3. 
 But investors took profits after the stock market's recent surge. Even after last week's setback, the S.& P. 500 remained 31 percent above its March 9 low.
 For the week, the Dow lost 306.01 points, or 3.6 percent, to close at 8,268.64. The S.& P. 500 dropped 46.35 points, or 5.0 percent, to close at 882.88. The Nasdaq composite index fell 58.86 points, or 3.5 percent, to close at 1,680.14.
 The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 3.13 percent from 3.29 percent the previous week. 
 The futures price for a barrel of oil fell in New York to $56.34 from $58.63 the previous week. JEFF SOMMER

HEADLINE: Here, I'm Cutting the Cake ... Here, I'm in a Nightie

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS QUENQUA

 BODY:
IN an age of economic anxiety, wedding photographers have had to confront a particular form of camera shyness: the price of their packages, which can run as much as $8,000 or more in New York and other large cities. 
 Well aware of this fear of commitment, some photographers have taken to tossing in extras like engagement photographs, day-after-the-wedding photographs and, a new fad, intimate photographs of the bride. 
 As the market becomes even more competitive, many photographers are realizing that one of their best sources of income may be the clients they already have. Some have expanded into baby photographs and birthday-party photographs in order to take advantage of the relationships formed before the clients were married.
 ''When I shoot someone's wedding day I always try to treat clients as a friend, so when they do get pregnant with that first baby, I'm the first person they call, and when that child turns 1, they want me there for the party,'' said Kelly Manno, a wedding photographer in St. Louis, who estimated that as much as 70 percent of her brides come back. ''So many of my clients now are return, return, return,'' she said.
 Mrs. Manno's diligence won the loyalty of Tasha Griesenauer of St. Charles, Mo. 
 ''She was so wonderful to work with and the photographs from our wedding turned out so good that I couldn't imagine using anyone else,'' she said.
 That loyalty turned out to be no small thing. Mrs. Griesenauer now has two children and she has turned to Ms. Manno for pictures of the births, the newborns and the ensuing birthday parties. 
 Jennifer Napier, the chief executive of OneWed.com, a wedding vendor marketplace, said that the economy had prompted many photographers not only to enhance their wedding packages but to also reinvent themselves, at least somewhat.
 ''They're diversifying just to make sure they have enough work coming in,'' she said.
 Paul Von Rieter, a wedding photographer in Mission Viejo, Calif., began taking day-after photographs of the bride and the bridegroom performing tasks around the house while wearing parts of their wedding outfits with casual clothes, after seeing similar photographs online.
 ''It's one of those things where it's not going to garner me any more revenue or profit, but if I put it in the package it makes me look more attractive over other photographers,'' he said.
 Many wedding photographers are finding they can attract clients with so-called boudoir sessions -- sexy, playful shots of a bride, wearing, say, nothing but her fiance's favorite sports jersey, or lingerie. These sessions have become extremely popular in the past year, said Stefanie Kimball, a photographer in Mendon, Mass., who said she has photographed 200 sessions. 
 ''When I first started doing it three years ago, there were three of us in Massachusetts'' who did boudoir photographs, she said. ''Today there are 10 or 15.''
 Heather Hartmann, a 25-year-old assistant bank manager from Taunton, Mass., said she decided to sit for a boudoir session as an untraditional wedding gift for her fiance after seeing an ad for Mrs. Kimball's studio on theknot.com.
 ''I was looking to do something different and fun as a gift,'' said Ms. Hartmann, who will be married in June. ''I don't think he would ever expect I would do something like this. I think his first question is going to be, 'Was it a female photographer?' I can't wait to see his reaction. I think his face will drop.''
 Tammy Swales, a photographer in Rochester, said adding a bit of raciness to the wedding album has helped her through tough times.
 ''As photographers, we have to look at diversifying and broadening what we're doing,'' she said, adding, ''I love making girls look pretty, so it's wonderful.''
 Much of the appeal of the boudoir sessions, Ms. Swales said, is that the brides want pictures of themselves in the best shape of their lives after the pre-wedding regimens of dieting and exercise.
 ''It's empowering for these women,'' she said.
 Andrea Pearson, 24, of Littleton, Colo., who was married in January and had bedroom pictures taken for her album, said: ''You have to find someone you're comfortable with. If you're not comfortable, its going to be an unpleasant experience. It doesn't matter what size you are. It's all about being confident.''
 Several male photographers said they did not offer bedroom sessions because many brides -- and perhaps their fiances -- were skittish. But William Thomas Cain, a Philadelphia photographer, found a way to be part of the trend.
 ''I'm not offering boudoir,'' he said. ''I'm offering it as more of a Maxim-style swimsuit thing. It's a little less risque than boudoir.''
 Yet even in a time of tight money, most photographers would rather add a session than lower their fees. Some, though, have had to be creative.
 When faced with a pair of stubborn negotiators recently, Mr. Cain dreamed up a novel solution. 
 ''They were about to walk away when I said to the bride, 'Are you on Facebook?' '' Mr. Cain said. ''She said yes, so I said, 'Well I offer a 10 percent Facebook discount.' I pulled that out of thin air.''
 In return, they agreed to add him as a friend and put their wedding photographs on their Facebook pages. 
 That ad lib quickly became a standard part of his business.

HEADLINE: The Wide, Messy World Of Sports

BYLINE: By HARRY HURT III

 BODY:
SPORTS is regarded as serious business, a source of multibillion-dollar revenue, national pride and popular entertainment that can seem like (and occasionally become) a matter of life or death. 
 But does the sports business actually share its full benefits with fans and taxpayers who support it? According to Stefan Szymanski, author of ''Playbooks and Checkbooks: An Introduction to the Economics of Modern Sports'' (Princeton University Press, $29.95), the answer is a resounding no. 
 ''Modern sports are undoubtedly in a mess,'' Mr. Szymanski declares. ''Corruption, exploitation, monopoly abuse, drug abuse, cheating, foul conduct on the field and criminal offenses off it -- there is almost no form of human misconduct that cannot be found in abundance.'' 
 Mr. Szymanski, an economics professor at the Cass Business School at City University in London, tackles the apparent paradoxes of the sports business in the head-on style of an N.F.L. linebacker. When he turns to subjects like antitrust issues and broadcasting rights, his disquisitions become more academic. He displays an impressive global knowledge of sports ranging from basketball and cricket to tennis and rugby, and provides a wealth of revealing financial information as well as entertaining sports trivia.
 At the outset, Mr. Szymanski describes the key element that distinguishes the sports business from enterprises like investment banking or automaking.
 ''In the business world the bankruptcy of your rivals is even better than collusion,'' he observes. ''What makes the sports business different is that you cannot have a business without your rivals. What the sports business is selling is rivalry -- and without rivals there is nothing to sell.''
 Rivalries, of course, are as old as time and are found in almost all forms of human society, often starting as preadolescent play. ''Adults show how seriously play is to be treated when they organize it into a 'sport,' '' Mr. Szymanski notes. 
 In a deftly succinct historical overview, he reminds us that ancient sports had a military purpose (preparing young men for war), and a religious purpose (a dress rehearsal of victory to the battle cry ''With God on our side.'') 
 The ancient Greeks even pioneered a form of the ticker-tape parade when, in 412 B.C., the Olympic running champion Exaentus of Agrigentum was driven through the streets in a chariot followed by 300 prominent citizens. Clearly, the Greeks were able practitioners of the phenomenon we now know as hype.
 Today, one the greatest conduits of hype is television. Mr. Szymanski notes that American and European sports moguls initially resisted the introduction of television for fear the broadcasts would deter fans from attending games at their stadiums.
 As it turned out, television actually swelled the overall size of sports audiences and created an enormous new income stream. As a case in point, Mr. Szymanski cites the growth of the N.F.L. into a behemoth that grosses $3.7 billion in broadcast rights revenue.
 The most intriguing part of Mr. Szymanski's book is the chapter titled ''Sports and the Public Purse,'' in which he debunks the collective myth he calls the ''sporting money illusion.'' Fans, boosters and politicians generally assume that events like the Olympics produce huge economic benefits for the host country. 
 Not so, Mr. Szymanski says. He reports that staging the 2004 Summer Games in Athens, which included building a score of sports facilities, cost $11.5 billion. But the Olympics generated only $2 billion in revenue for the Athens organizing committee, and tourism actually declined from the previous year. 
 Mr. Szymanski is even more critical of publicly financed sports facilities. He reports that over the last 20 years, some 60 big stadiums and arenas have been built in the United States, costing taxpayers more than $20 billion. He dismisses claims that these projects create jobs, attract tourists and expand the local economy. 
 ''Most of the spending on the stadium (construction costs, player salaries) goes to people who live outside the city, and therefore the economic benefit is exported,'' he writes. ''Conversely, most of those who buy tickets live inside the city, and hence their spending is simply displacing leisure spending that would have gone to other local businesses.''
 WE live in the age of tarnished sports superheroes, as steroid scandals vividly illustrate. But Mr. Szymanski lays the blame for most of the problems afflicting sports on fans rather than on self-centered players or avaricious team owners.
 ''We want to see excess, we want to see the contest to be taken to the ultimate limit and we are willing to pay handsomely for it,'' he writes. ''Our demand for winning is what drives much of the excess in the sports world of today.''
 Mr. Szymanski does not offer detailed prescriptions for alleviating the problems he identifies in sports, in part because he has a rather fatalistic attitude about overcoming human frailties. He rejects most calls for more government regulation as knee-jerk reactions that ''would attack symptoms rather than the disease.''
 He sees a few glimmers of hope. For example, he says, the increasing fragmentation of sports programming may draw attention away from Olympic-sized events and perhaps reduce the importance placed on winning -- but he does not say exactly how. One thing he seems certain of is that ''the excesses of today will be dwarfed by the malfeasance that is to come.''

HEADLINE: Lawmakers Consider Statewide Tax on Disposable Shopping Bags

BYLINE: By GREGORY B. HLADKY

DATELINE: HARTFORD 

 BODY:
 BANNING plastic bags has become a popular idea in several cities across the country, but some Connecticut lawmakers say their plan to impose a 5-cent tax on all disposable shopping bags not only would help the environment but would also pull in some cash for a state in deep fiscal trouble.
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York has called for a 6-cent ''bag tax,'' following the lead of many European countries that already charge taxes on plastic bags. A similar plan has been proposed in Philadelphia, and Seattle voters will go to the polls in August to decide on a 20-cent tax on paper and plastic grocery bags. 
 If it is approved by the legislature, Connecticut would be the first state to impose a bag tax.
 Connecticut fiscal experts estimate that a nickel tax on plastic and paper shopping bags would initially raise about $20 million a year. Supporters of the plan say half the money would pay for new recycling efforts and the rest would be used to save environmental programs in danger of budget cuts.
 Critics of the bag tax warn that the middle of a severe recession is no time to impose new costs on consumers. Moreover, they say, a nickel tax may not be high enough to discourage many shoppers from using disposable bags, and the revenue will make Connecticut dependent on a tax that should instead be aimed at weening shoppers from the plastic bags. One key opponent is Gov. M. Jodi Rell, who said incentives to encourage reuse of bags was preferable to any new tax. Last September, Westport became the first municipality in Connecticut to enact a ban on stores providing plastic bags.
 Connecticut's legislation on a bag tax would mean that municipalities could not enact bans, which serve as a carrot more than a stick to get consumers to change their ways. Several communities throughout the United States, including San Francisco, have banned nondegradable shopping bags to encourage shoppers to use their own eco-friendly bags. Some of the municipal bans have included fines for retailers that continue to use throwaway bags.
 Denise Merrill, the House majority leader and a Mansfield Democrat, is in favor of the bag tax, although she acknowledged that opposition to the plan ''may be insurmountable.''
 ''But it's an avoidable tax,'' Ms. Merrill said, adding that even if it passes, consumers could bypass it by buying reusable bags for as little as 50 cents each.
 The legislature's Finance Committee voted 28 to 22 last month to approve a measure that would combine the bag tax and a proposal to use some of the money to make it easier for people to recycle cans, bottles and other materials. 
 Called ''single-source recycling,'' the plan would allow Connecticut residents to put all recyclable materials in a single large curbside bin. Currently, people who have curbside recycling in their communities must separate bottles and cans, paper and cardboard.
 Representative Linda Schofield, a Democrat from Simsbury who is one of the authors of the recycling proposal, said the bag tax would help pay huge municipal start-up costs of single-source recycling. She said the big recycling bins can cost as much as $60 each. ''We're easily talking about $500,000 to $1 million for small to moderate-sized towns.''
 ''We have an enormous budget problem, and there is no way we could get it passed without a funding source,'' Ms. Schofield said.
 Connecticut already has a 5-cent deposit system for most bottles and cans. Consumers can redeem beverage containers by bringing them back to retailers. Advocates of single-source recycling say having one curbside bin for all recyclable materials will eventually replace what they say is an outdated and cumbersome bottle deposit system.
 The idea of using a bag tax to help pay for municipal start-up costs for single-source recycling strikes some lawmakers, like the Senate minority leader, John McKinney, as a sure way to kill the recycling proposal.
 ''I think the nickel tax on bags is the wrong approach,'' said Mr. McKinney, a Republican from Fairfield. He said one major flaw in the legislation is that it ''pre-empts any town from banning plastic bags.''
 Mr. McKinney said Fairfield and several other cities and towns in the region were considering enacting their own plastic bag bans. ''To simply extinguish that grass-roots movement is the wrong thing to do,'' he said.
 The issue has split Connecticut's retailers. Some major food stores support the combined bag tax-single source recycling bill, while a group of other types of merchants are opposed to it.
 Stan Sorkin, president of the Connecticut Food Association, said one reason his members were backing the measure was that ''we are very much opposed to a ban on plastic bags.''
 He said most consumers, if they can't get plastic bags, simply ask for paper bags. ''Paper bags are just as bad for the environment,'' Mr. Sorkin said, ''and they are two to four times more expensive than plastic bags for our stores.''
 Tim Phelan, president of the Connecticut Retail Merchants Association, argued that a tax on bags would harm both consumers and the ''small, independent, mainstream merchants'' that make up his membership.

HEADLINE: THE CHINA PUZZLE

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
David Leonhardt is an economics columnist for The Times and a staff writer for the magazine. His most recent article was an interview with President Obama.

 BODY:
On Timothy Geithner's first day as a Dartmouth freshman, while he was walking across campus on his way to register for classes in the fall of 1979, he heard a man speaking Thai -- swearing in Thai, to be precise -- from a balcony. Geithner found this amusing, because only a couple of months before, he left his home in Thailand, where his father worked for the Ford Foundation, to move to Hanover, N.H. So he stopped to talk to the man, who turned out to be David Keenan, a Chinese teacher at Dartmouth. The two quickly realized that they had a lot in common; among other things they attended the same schools, about a decade apart, in Bangkok and Delhi. (The cause of Keenan's swearing, alas, has been lost to history.) Having established a rapport, Keenan then decided to do a little salesmanship. He urged Geithner to take Chinese, the only Asian language that Dartmouth offered at the time. 
 Geithner did, and found that he liked it. Learning another Asian language, he told me recently in his soaring office at the Treasury Department, ''was a nice little piece of continuity for me.'' He ended up majoring in government and Asian studies and taught basic Mandarin classes to make some money. After Dartmouth, he attended the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins. He then spent three years at Kissinger Associates, working with Brent Scowcroft, the future national security adviser, and helping Henry Kissinger write chapters on China and Japan for one of his books. From there, he joined the Treasury Department and began a meteoric rise through the bureaucracy. 
 In the five months since Barack Obama introduced him as the next Treasury secretary, Geithner has already run through what seems to be a career's worth of images: the brilliant technocrat whose appointment caused stocks to soar; the neophyte public figure who flopped in his debut; the regulator who has grown too close to Wall Street; the Obama adviser with the same unflappable nature as his boss. One image that hasn't yet attached itself to him, however, is his original professional image. By training, Tim Geithner is a China hand. And though the immediate financial crisis is likely to dominate his tenure at Treasury, the economic relationship between the United States and China may ultimately prove just as important. It could be crucial to preventing the next crisis.
 Over the past decade, China and the United States have developed a deeply symbiotic, and dangerous, relationship. China discovered that an economy built on cheap exports would allow it to grow faster than it ever had and to create enough jobs to mollify its impoverished population. American consumers snapped up these cheap exports -- shoes, toys, electronics and the like -- and China soon found itself owning a huge pile of American dollars. Governments don't like to hold too much cash, because it pays no return, so the Chinese bought many, many Treasury bonds with their dollars. This additional demand for Treasuries was one big reason (though not the only reason) that interest rates fell so low in recent years. Thanks to those low interest rates, Americans were able to go on a shopping spree and buy some things, like houses, they couldn't really afford. China kept lending and exporting, and we kept borrowing and consuming. It all worked very nicely, until it didn't. 
 The most obviously worrisome part of the situation today is that the Chinese could decide that they no longer want to buy Treasury bonds. The U.S. government's recent spending for bank bailouts and stimulus may be necessary to get the economy moving again, but it also raises the specter of eventual inflation, which would damage the value of Treasuries. If the Chinese are unnerved by this, they could instead use their cash to buy the bonds of other countries, which would cause interest rates here to jump, prolonging the recession. Wen Jiabao, China's premier, seemed to raise this possibility in March, in remarks to reporters at the end of the annual session of China's Parliament. ''We have lent a huge amount of money to the U.S.,'' Wen said. ''Of course we are concerned about the safety of our assets. To be honest, I am definitely a little worried.'' In all likelihood, this was mostly posturing. Were China to cut back sharply on its purchase of Treasury bonds, it would send the value of the bonds plummeting, hurting the Chinese, who already own hundreds of billions of dollars' worth. Yet Wen's comments, which made headlines around the world, did highlight an underlying truth. The relationship between the United States and China can't continue on its current path.
 It has already helped create the global economic crisis, by splashing cheap money around the world and enabling American indebtedness and overconsumption. This country is now suffering through its worst recession since the early 1980s, one that could ultimately become the worst since the Great Depression. In China, the collapse of global trade has eliminated 20 million jobs along the industrial southern coast, according to Beijing's official numbers. One Obama adviser told me the real number may be much higher. 
 So putting the global economy onto a more sustainable path will require dealing with the imbalances between China and the United States. In the broadest terms, this will mean that Americans must consume less and that Chinese must consume more. Domestically, Obama's economic agenda is organized around the first half of this equation. He has said that economic growth must rely less on consumer spending than it has, and he is pushing for a series of investments -- in education, science, medicine and alternative energy -- the fruits of which are meant to replace consumption. But those fruits won't mature as quickly as American households are paring back. For the sake of the global economy, persuading China to consume more will be crucial, too. It will also make a big difference to China's 1.3 billion citizens. Most are still poor enough that consumption doesn't mean yet another Barbie or iPod; it means basic comforts, like medical care and transportation. 
 Moving to an economy based more on consumption and less on exports happens to be the policy of the Chinese government, and has been since 2003. Its latest five-year economic plan, announced in 2006, was organized around the idea. ''The biggest problem in China's economy,'' Wen said in 2007, ''is that the growth is unstable, imbalanced, uncoordinated and unsustainable.'' Remarkably, though, the Chinese economy has become even less reliant on household spending, and even more reliant on business and government spending, in recent years. Consumer spending now makes up about 35 percent of China's gross domestic product, down from 40 percent in 2004 and almost 50 percent in the early 1990s. By comparison, the share is 54 percent in India, 57 percent in Europe and 70 percent in the United States. 
 The challenge for Geithner and the rest of the Obama administration, then, is persuading China to live up to its own five-year plan.
 ***
 Given Geithner's history with China, his tenure as Treasury secretary could hardly have gotten off to a worse start. As part of his confirmation process, senators gave him a long list of written questions. One question was from Charles Schumer, the New York Democrat who has frequently criticized China for artificially holding down the value of its currency, the renminbi, who asked Geithner whether the U.S. should confront China on the issue. Geithner replied, in writing: ''President Obama -- backed by the conclusions of a broad range of economists -- believes that China is manipulating its currency.''
 The answer immediately became the big story about the confirmation hearing. It seemed to signal that the Obama administration would take a tougher line than the Bush administration on probably the most sensitive subject between the two countries. Many Chinese leaders were incensed. 
 Foreign-exchange rates are maddeningly complex, but the debate over the renminbi is really just a part of the broader issue of the economic imbalances between China and the United States. When a country exports more than it imports, as China has, the value of its currency tends to rise. Exports then become more expensive (and thus decline), while imports become relatively cheap (and increase). It's a self-correcting system that, theoretically, prevents big trade gaps between countries. But China has frequently intervened in the foreign-exchange markets to hold down the value of the renminbi and keep its exports booming. It has become less aggressive about doing so over the past few years, responding to international pressure, and the renminbi has risen more than 20 percent relative to the dollar. Still, many American economists say that it still appears to be undervalued by about 10 to 20 percent. The Chinese tend to take umbrage at this analysis, because it suggests their boom has come at the expense of others. 
 Against this backdrop, Geithner's debut as Treasury secretary struck a nerve in China. It was also personally painful for him. In the four months since, he has set out to undo the damage. After the hearing, administration officials quickly put out the story that the words about manipulation weren't really Geithner's. They were written by a midlevel staff member, who was helping Geithner answer the hundreds of written questions from senators. Geithner, staff members said, did not mean to signal a new hard line.
 Once in office, Geithner himself also began reaching out to the Chinese. ''I have talked to my counterparts in China over the past few months much more than I've talked to my counterparts from any other country,'' he told me. During the G-20 meetings in London last month, he traveled to the Mandarin Oriental Hotel for a late-night meeting in the suite of Vice Premier Wang Qishan. The two have also spoken regularly by phone. When I asked Geithner whether his language skills were good enough to make translators unnecessary, he laughed and said it had been a long time since he taught Mandarin. But he and Wang still seem to have developed a tentative rapport, thanks in part to their similar backgrounds. Wang has been nicknamed the Fireman because, like Geithner, he owes his rise to the work he has done on various economic crises. ''He's my kind of person,'' Geithner said, ''pragmatic'' -- the ultimate compliment in the Obama circle -- ''very direct.''
 Frequent as the conversations with the Chinese have been, though, their content is telling. They have not focused on the imbalances in consumption and trade. Instead, the discussions have been about the comparatively tame issue of what the two countries have been doing to stimulate the global economy. Unlike most European countries, the United States and China have enacted big stimulus programs. Geithner has also walked Wang through the administration's plan for bringing down the budget deficit in the future, which is meant to assuage Chinese fears that the dollar, and the value of Treasury bonds, could crash.
 Since Geithner's confirmation hearing, the Obama administration's general approach to China has been something of a charm offensive. When Secretary of State Hillary Clinton went to Beijing in February, she made sure to avoid any suggestion that she was criticizing the government's human rights record, as she did during a 1995 visit as first lady. At his G-20 bilateral meeting with Chinese leaders, Obama described China as ''a great power,'' a phrase Wen is fond of using. And when the Treasury Department issued its annual report on foreign currencies in mid-April, it concluded that China was not manipulating its currency. Instead, Geithner praised China for taking ''steps to enhance exchange-rate flexibility,'' a reference to the recent rise in the renminbi. 
 The message that has been coming from Beijing, meanwhile, has sounded almost hostile. In the weeks that followed Wen's comments at the end of the Parliament session, Chinese leaders made clear that the aggressive posture wasn't a one-time event. In late March, Zhou Xiaochuan -- the head of China's central bank and the senior official who's closest to Geithner -- gave a speech suggesting that the dollar be replaced as the world's reserve currency. In late April, the minister of commerce published an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal saying that American complaints about China's trade policy would ''seriously test China-U.S. economic and trade relations.''
 The most remarkable aspect of these remarks is how much of a departure they are from China's usual stance. Deng Xiaoping, the Chinese leader who ushered in its market reforms starting in the late 1970s, famously gave his country the following advice: ''Observe calmly; secure our position; cope with affairs calmly; hide our capacities and bide our time; be good at maintaining a low profile; and never claim leadership.'' 
 Obama administration officials take comfort in the fact that the Chinese haven't followed up their confrontational words with confrontational actions. This seems to indicate that the words are intended to soothe a domestic audience upset about job losses more than they are a sign of actual policy (much as Geithner's and Obama's rhetoric on trade is). But if nothing else, the last few months have suggested that China is no longer content to maintain a low profile. 
 ***
 When economists describe the relationship between China and the United States, it often sounds circular and even permanent. We save too little and they save too much. They export too much and we consume too much. The situation can seem to be a reflection of Chinese and American cultures, with their respective attitudes toward thrift and hedonism.
 Yet the huge imbalances between the two economies are actually a very recent phenomenon. Throughout most of the 1990s, China's current account surplus -- the value of exports minus the value of imports -- equaled less than 2 percent of its gross domestic product. As late as 2001, this surplus was only 1.3 percent of G.D.P. But then it began soaring. Last year, it was 10 percent of G.D.P., according to the World Bank. In more concrete terms, China sold $338 billion worth of goods to American consumers and business, more than the combined annual revenue of Microsoft, Apple, Coca-Cola, Boeing, Johnson & Johnson and Goldman Sachs. American businesses sold only $71 billion to the Chinese.
 How did this happen? Nicholas Lardy, a China expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, compares the relationship to that of an addict and a drug dealer. Americans became hooked on cheap goods and cheap money, and China came to depend on the income from selling those goods. Chinese leaders didn't set out with a grand plan to create an enormous trade gap, Lardy argues, but each step along the way seemed to make sense. ''I think they genuinely fell into this,'' he says. The authoritarian government could stifle dissent with jobs. Local party leaders were rewarded for presiding over economic growth, and exports were the easiest way to achieve it. Once the export sector was built up, the cost of allowing the renminbi to appreciate was enormous.
 If you think of the exports as the first link in the causal chain, the resulting pile of Chinese savings is the second. Much of this savings has been by the corporate sector, which is subsidized by the government in all sorts of ways (an undervalued currency, low interest rates, cheap energy). The economic boom brought big profits, and companies held on to much of them. The government has also increased its savings in this decade by collecting more taxes and, until the financial crisis, running a budget surplus. And households increased their own savings in the 1990s, in reaction to the dismantling of many bloated state-run companies and the cradle-to-grave benefits, known as the ''iron rice bowl,'' they once provided to their workers. When a Chinese citizen is rushed to the hospital after a car accident today, the first stop for the victim's family is often the cashier's window. Many hospitals won't admit patients until they have paid, and many families have no health insurance. Instead, they insure themselves, by saving. 
 These vast piles of savings have made up the crux of what Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, has called the ''global saving glut.'' By this telling, the imbalances can seem to be overwhelmingly China's fault. But that's not really the case. Just as policy makers in Beijing encouraged the rise in savings and exports, American policy makers took steps that encouraged overconsumption. They allowed incomes for most families to stagnate, which made savings a luxury that many couldn't afford and debt a way to finance rising living standards. Alan Greenspan and, to a lesser extent, Bernanke encouraged a series of financial innovations, like cash-out mortgage refinancings and interest-only mortgages, that tempted people to spend more and save less. Washington pretended -- even argued -- that there was no housing bubble. As Justin Yifu Lin, a Chinese economist who became the World Bank's chief economist last year, says, ''You can't put this all on China.''
 Even more to the point, China, like the United States, is now paying a price for the two countries' co-dependent relationship. The coastal cities that experienced tremendous booms over the past decade are struggling with mass unemployment. Millions of recent college graduates, the demographic that often starts protest movements, are unemployed across China. Stocks have fallen more sharply than they have here. These are the consequences of the unsustainable growth Wen worried about in 2007. And they provide the Obama administration with perhaps its one compelling argument for why Beijing should listen to their advice: It's in China's interest. 
 ''There is symmetry,'' Geithner says. ''We want the world to emerge from this with a different balance of domestic and export growth, here and around the world, and we want recovery to be a little less driven by the U.S. consumer, both for our purposes as well as for the world.'' A more vibrant consumer economy in China would, by definition, mean spreading more of the bounty from China's boom to its masses, rather than allowing it to pile up in corporate or government coffers. A better safety net would give households enough peace of mind to spend their money. The Chinese consumer could begin replacing some of the spending that had been done by the once-indefatigable American consumer. This spending would benefit companies all over the world, but none more than those in China.
 ***
 At the end of a discussion with Lardy about the imbalances between the U.S. and China, I asked him what forms of leverage he thought the Obama administration had. ''We have no leverage,'' he replied. He then couched this slightly, saying that the administration could threaten the Chinese with trade barriers but that such threats weren't likely to be very credible.
 Geithner had told me that he considered Lardy one of the more insightful China analysts, and so I repeated the point about leverage to Geithner and asked for his reaction. He made it clear that he essentially agreed. ''When I was last in this building,'' he said, referring to his time as an international expert in the Clinton Treasury Department, ''I was always thinking, What's our next point of influence, of leverage?'' But he could rarely find a good one.
 Geithner then mentioned reading an old newspaper interview with Michel Camdessus, the head of the International Monetary Fund in the 1990s. Camdessus's tenure included the Asian financial crisis and Mexican peso crisis, and some European leaders were unhappy about the extent to which the I.M.F. followed the advice of American policy makers, Geithner among them, in managing these crises. Geithner recalled that when the interviewer asked about this, Camdessus replied that America had influence disproportionate to its weight in the institution only when it had an idea others were willing to follow. The Camdessus strategy -- make sure you have an idea worth following -- will be the Treasury Department's approach to China. 
 The strategy actually dates to the Bush administration and a series of meetings with Chinese leaders that Henry Paulson, Geithner's predecessor, helped set up. If Obama's advisers admire one aspect of President Bush's economic policy -- and coming up with another isn't easy -- it's the effort to nurture a relationship with China. The meetings, which began in 2006, were called the Strategic Economic Dialogue. For the first sessions, Bernanke accompanied Paulson as a demonstration of respect to the Chinese and a sign of how seriously United States viewed the agenda. American and Chinese officials are now negotiating the logistical details of the next round of the dialogue, which will be jointly led by Geithner and Clinton. Internally, officials from State, Treasury and elsewhere in the administration have been jockeying for influence over China policy. But they all seem to agree that one of the main goals of the dialogue is to bring a wide variety of important Chinese officials -- including those who represent industries and regions that have benefited from the imbalances -- into the same room for the talks. 
 During the initial 2006 meetings, in a speech at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, Bernanke laid out the essential parts of the argument that the Americans are likely to make this year. He began by ticking off what he called China's ''remarkable accomplishments'': the quintupling of per capita economic output, the lifting of 200 million people out of poverty and the like. But then, in the polite, technical manner of a central banker, he turned to its imbalances. He argued that by overinvesting in heavy industry, China had failed to grow as quickly as it could have (and to create more jobs for its people). It was devoting significantly more of its output to such investments than Japan or South Korea had during their respective rises in the 20th century, yet China was growing no faster than they had. That ran counter to economic theory and suggested, though Bernanke didn't say so in these terms, that China was wasting resources. Rather than spreading the bounty of its boom and allowing households and businesses to find productive uses for it, China was spending so much on heavy industry and its export sector that it was necessarily propping up weak businesses. In 2006, this argument might have sounded like nit-picking. It doesn't today.
 There have recently been some signs that China has become more serious about dealing with its imbalances. For the first time since 2000, its trade surplus shrank, relative to G.D.P., last year. Late last year, China also cut taxes on fuel-efficient vehicles, which led to a surge in sales that helped Chinese consumers surpass American consumers, at least for now, as the world's largest purchasers of vehicles. China's economic planners also seem to have focused more in the last few years on highways and other infrastructure that would help households and sectors other than industrial ones. David Loevinger, the Treasury Department's representative in Beijing, told me that when he visited the Great Wall recently, he drove on a highway that didn't exist a year ago. And China has announced a plan to provide health insurance to hundreds of millions more people over the next three years. Jim O'Neill, the chief economist of Goldman Sachs, recently wrote that the health care expansion could prove to be ''the most important development in the world economy.''
 ***
 Geithner, along with other administration officials, insists that he is cautiously optimistic about the path China is on. And that's understandable. It's not especially pleasant to think about what the global economy will look like if China and the United States fail to fix their dysfunctional relationship.
 The frequent flares of social unrest in China could spread, and the government could decide that its short-term problems take precedence over its long-term ones. It might then try to stimulate its economy at the expense of everyone else -- the beggar-thy-neighbor approach -- by reversing the recent rise of the renminbi, lavishing new subsidies on exporters and restricting imports. In an otherwise optimistic article in a recent issue of The Atlantic Monthly, James Fallows, an American writer living in China, pointed out that the United States followed a similar protectionist strategy during the Great Depression. As a big exporter, it felt the need to help its struggling manufacturers. Other countries soon retaliated, and the depression deepened. 
 For China, such a strategy would resemble a doubling down. It would benefit the same parts of the economy -- the industrial sectors, the coastal south, the wealthy -- that have already done the best. Living standards for the rest of China would continue to grow more slowly than the pace of economic growth suggests they should. 
 For the rest of the world, China's retreat would mean slower growth. The much-anticipated day when the Chinese middle class became a global economic force would be pushed back. If China remained committed to a smokestack growth policy, the efforts to slow climate change would become all the more difficult. China's energy needs have already caused it to become closer to the governments in Iran and Saudi Arabia, and if China moved even closer, it could further complicate the already complicated balance of power in the Middle East. 
 Here in the United States, we could delude ourselves into thinking that our consumer economy really was sustainable. We could put off the hard choices, and sacrifice, that will inevitably be part of building a new one. There may not be a single one of the world's most vexing problems, in fact, that isn't aggravated by the imbalances between the United States and China.
 In an odd way, that reality makes Obama's advisers more hopeful. Jeffrey Bader, who now runs the East Asian affairs office for the National Security Council, has pointed out that China has made a series of choices since Deng's reforms -- allowing more imports, joining international organizations, building ties with foreign governments it previously tried to overthrow -- that were all ''designed to be supportive of the existing order.'' Geithner makes the same point: ''They have a deep stake in the system now. And they recognize this.''
 So it's only reasonable to think that the United States and China will figure out how to solve their problems. Unsustainable economic trends are just that -- unsustainable. But they can, unfortunately, cause a lot of damage before they are resolved.

HEADLINE: Recession Special

BYLINE: By STEPHEN METCALF

 BODY:
We approached Pittsburgh through a drizzly scrim of rain, then drifted through its version of Williamsburg in Brooklyn, an old blue-collar quarter called Lawrenceville. The row houses were small and irregularly packed, like bad dentition; what few pedestrians there were floated by in a haze. My friend looked out the car window and said, simply, ''Matewan.'' Then we found Brillobox. 
 Brillobox is a bar, cafe and arts space. On first blush, it looks like your average hipster oasis plunked down in the midst of urban blight. ''You had to bust through four drop ceilings to get to the tin ceiling,'' the co-owner Eric Stern told us. ''There were so many holes in it, they had to build floating ceilings beneath it to patch it.'' Now the place is filled with maraschino-red Naugahyde booths (''found on Craigslist''), bordello-red wallpaper (''I'm a sucker for deep, sensuous reds'') and tree branches that canopy out from behind the bar (''we took those from the cemetery''). A local artist has dotted these with pink blossoms. 
 My friend and I showed up on a Sunday night, to attend the weekly Starving Artists Sunday Supper. Five bucks gets you a sesame tofu wrap with fried rice, peanut curry sauce and house-made slaw. As we wolfed down what amounted to a perfect meal, Stern talked about the genesis of Brillobox. Stern, an artist in his early 40s, and his wife, Renee, are originally from Pittsburgh. Stern did a philosophy degree at Berkeley, an M.F.A., and then, with Renee, a stint in the New York art world. Burned out, they returned home to create . . . something. ''We had no idea what we'd start,'' he said. ''We weren't bar people. Our only guiding principle was: Make it a place we'd want to come to.''
 Brillobox has drawn crowds of nonlocals --young people with Gmail accounts and unfinished degrees -- into Lawrenceville. But for Stern, booze and lounging were just the beginning: ''When I saw the second floor, I said, 'O.K., this is it.' This could coalesce the energies of the community.'' Upstairs is a space for plays, music, art events, fund-raisers, comedy, readings. ''We didn't realize there were so many artists here, hungry for a place to call their own,'' Stern said. The Box is now a neighborhood beachhead. 
 Our table was filling up. We were joined by a novelist, a D.J., a philosophy grad student, a liver specialist, a rock musician and a lapsed Mormon. Thankfully, the liver specialist claimed, we need only 40 percent of our liver to function; the table drank accordingly. ''We didn't start Lawrenceville, but we like to think we crystallized and focused it,'' Stern said, and the table agreed. ''Eric and his wife created a cool thing,'' said John Greenwell, the Box's daytime bartender. ''My dad passed away a couple of weeks ago. He worked for the railroad. We came in for Pub Quiz, and we watched the Super Bowl here. I've never felt uncomfortable in here.'' 
 Lauren, an animal-shelter worker, put the Box in Pittsburgh's context. She's from Duquesne, outside Pittsburgh, a town that went into free fall after the Carnegie Steel plant closed in the 1980s. ''People are talking about the economic downturn, and I've hardly known anything else,'' she said. ''There's a very blue-collar ethic here. Even if you're a lawyer or a doctor, someone in your family is blue-collar.'' Cory, a grad student on hiatus and a dead ringer for Gram Parsons circa ''Sweetheart of the Rodeo,'' chimes in. ''For the sake of conversation, let's call Pittsburgh a metropolitan area. It's insanely cheap. And safe. In six years, I've only been accosted by teenagers, and children.'' 
 I always thought you were meant to be disquieted by other people's cool, but that is not the formula at Brillobox. The place is a hipster pub, which is not an oxymoron in Pittsburgh, whose alternative paper last year named it both Best Overall Bar and Best Hipster Bar. The props of Gen Y irony are everywhere: Home Depot chandelier, chili pepper lights, the D.J.'s cool segue from Foghat to the ''Willy Wonka'' soundtrack, a lavatory that is an anarchist collage of decals and ink. (''It looks like Rosemary's Baby was whelped in there,'' my friend said.) But the ambience lies deeper. ''I walk in on a Saturday night,'' the novelist said. ''It's shoulder to shoulder. They're playing old-school funk -- nothing cutting-edge. And everyone here knows my story. They know what happened to me that week.''
 It was past midnight, and the place was working its magic. Maybe too well: some idiot was declaiming loudly to a table of wearied listeners. Would he never shut up? Worse, the idiot was me. The truth arrived through a fog of beer and whiskey, along with the awareness that I was being apologized for, gravely, by my friend. My right arm was gesturing madly. I was gibbering about the recession. The D.J. patted me on the back with a smile. ''Everyone is, 'recession, recession, recession,' '' he said. ''Hey, this is how we live in Pittsburgh.''

HEADLINE: From a Two-Income Family to Almost Losing Their Home

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

DATELINE: Milford 

 BODY:
 DOUGLAS UNGER discovered that all of his accolades as a champion wrestler who once qualified for the Olympics and his connections in the financial services industry as a corporate recruiter meant little when trying to save his home here from foreclosure. 
 ''I basically thought I was going to lose my home,'' he said. ''I raised my family here.'' 
 Before this year, the only connection that Mr. Unger and his wife, Susan, had to foreclosure was that they had bought their home out of foreclosure in 1993 for $200,000. 
 Over the years, they had little trouble keeping up with the monthly mortgage payments. Dual incomes helped: Her job as a waitress at a Milford sports bar paid for groceries while his commission checks as a corporate recruiter covered bigger bills like the mortgage. 
 But in late 2006, their mortgage payment jumped to $3,100, from $2,300, when they refinanced the house to renovate the kitchen and bathroom and their interest rate went up. Then, last year, they both lost their jobs. They quickly started missing mortgage payments. 
 Ms. Unger soon found a job as a waitress near the Milford courthouse and Mr. Unger went into business for himself as a corporate recruiter. But they remained two months behind in mortgage payments, though they carefully avoided falling a third month behind, knowing that the third missed payment is the trigger point at which banks typically file for foreclosure. 
 ''We made payments. But it was always a 'rolling late,' '' said Ms. Unger, meaning they were not up to date on the payments. 
 The Ungers and their five children all pitched in to reduce costs. 
 Mr. Unger cut back the cellphone plans for the family and canceled cable TV and satellite radio. They removed their above-ground swimming pool and planted a larger garden to grow more tomatoes, basil and onions. 
 The family started eating pasta with homemade tomato sauce nearly every night, mainly because it is relatively inexpensive.
 As Mr. Unger tried to build his business, he said, he spent part of each day calling CitiMortgage -- their lender at the time -- to try to work out a deal to modify his loan before his house went into foreclosure. For more than three months, he kept one of his phone lines open with CitiMortgage for more than four hours each weekday, he said, trying to reach the correct department. 
 He became so concerned when he could not reach the lender's representative, he said, that he called the office of State Attorney General Richard Blumenthal to complain. The office referred him to Neighborhood Housing Services of New Haven, a nonprofit organization. 
 He wanted to make sure he reached the correct department at CitiMortgage before his home officially fell into foreclosure.
 Mark Rodgers, a spokesman for Citigroup, would not comment on the specific terms of Mr. Unger's case. But he said CitiMortgage was ''working hard'' to help borrowers avoid foreclosure. 
 ''Since early 2007, Citi has worked successfully with approximately 520,000 borrowers, including approximately 80,000 in the first three months of this year, to avoid potential foreclosure through modifications, extensions, forbearance and reinstatements,'' he said. 
 In early February, Mr. Unger started working on foreclosure prevention with Tom Citerella, a senior housing counselor at Neighborhood Housing Services. By March, Mr. Citerella had arranged a new 30-year, 5.16 percent mortgage for the Ungers, one that did not require them to pay all of their late fees. That cut their payment by $1,000 a month, to $2,100. 
 Mr. Citerella said he was able to negotiate a deal quickly partly because the Ungers were not yet in foreclosure, and partly because he knew whom to call, having worked as a housing counselor for 11 years and, before that, in the real estate appraisal and mortgage industries. 
 But the Ungers have clearly been affected by the experience of coming so close to foreclosure. On Mr. Unger's 49th birthday, April 6, the family deliberated long and hard over whether to splurge and go out to dinner for the first time in six months or stay home and dine on the pasta with the red sauce made from Roma tomatoes from their garden. They decided they had earned a dinner out.
 Still, they know that it could take only a few unexpected bills to put them back on the brink of foreclosure.
 Until late April, Mr. Unger said, they received daily phone calls from CitiMortgage's collections department, which apparently did not realize that another lender held their mortgage. 
 ''They took no personal view of my home or me,'' Mr. Unger said. ''I was just a number.''

HEADLINE: For Foods and 'a Few Things'

BYLINE: By KELLY FEENEY

 BODY:
At the restaurant Market in the Middle in Asbury Park, the market is actually in front and off to one side, but it is still at the heart of things. 
 ''Everything is connected,'' said Mark MacPherson, the executive chef, who has worked at Market in the Middle since shortly after it opened in 2006. ''If you try a wine you like at dinner, you can get it in the market.'' 
 You can also skip the restaurant, head straight to the market's deli counter and pick up a sandwich or salad for lunch to go. The market's Mediterranean-inspired menu is the same as the restaurant's, although many items cost slightly less. Dinner is available, too, but entrees are pricier (closer to $20).
 On a midday visit, a cup of chicken and vegetable soup in duck broth was a rich twist on the classic stock ($5; all prices are for takeout). Maytag salad sprinkled with the crumbly blue cheese, Marcona almonds and golden raisins was an apt accompaniment ($8). Another day, a blackened scallop and shrimp sandwich on a soft bun with lettuce, tomato and onion was spicy ($8, daily special). A side of salty sweet potato fries served with a bright curry mayonnaise was filling ($5) but there was still room for a slice of dense carrot torte ($5).
 ''The idea was to have a little market where you could stop in to get a few things,'' Mr. MacPherson said. Before the economy swooned, the market sold specialty vinegars, jams, crackers and such. Now, with less foot traffic, the shelves are stocked with what's most popular: wines, craft beers and artisanal cheeses. But you can still get a crusty baguette ($2.50). 
 Market in the Middle, 516 Cookman Avenue, Asbury Park; (732) 776-8886. Open Monday to Thursday, 11 a.m. to 10 p.m.; Friday and Saturday, 11 a.m. to 11 p.m.; Sunday, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.

HEADLINE: Therapists Get an Earful About Career Anxiety

BYLINE: By HANNAH SELIGSON

 BODY:
DENNIS PALUMBO, a Los Angeles-based psychotherapist who treats many artists and other creative types, says his patients previously tended to talk about problems like writer's block, procrastination and fear of rejection.
 ''Now it's ageism, fear of job loss and anxiety surrounding the job search,'' said Mr. Palumbo, who is also an author and a former screenwriter. ''The problems have shifted from creative to structural concerns.''
Amid high unemployment and layoffs, mental health professionals are seeing a marked increase in the time they spend talking about career-related issues with patients. Many people are seeking guidance from therapists about how to confront the storm that has hit the job market and toppled their lives. Sessions are often becoming a mosaic of traditional therapy, loosely defined as more process-oriented and focused on the past, and of coaching, which tends to be more goal- and behavior-oriented. 
 ''In many of my sessions we role-play networking, how to talk about skills and accomplishments, and how to get a raise in this market,'' says Robert C. Chope, a professor of counseling at San Francisco State University and president of the employment counseling division of the American Counseling Association.
 Peter Turkl, a clinical social worker and executive coach based in New York, says the method he uses to look at behavior patterns and ways to change them has come to the forefront in the last few months, as opposed to talking about relationships and issues lingering from the past. ''Sometimes an entire session will just be devoted to coaching, and I'll give my patient homework to deal with a particular obstacle,'' he said. 
 Employment psychology and career coaching are now in the spotlight. Though related, they are hardly twins. To hang a therapist's shingle, most states demand a master's degree and a license, which requires a certain number of client contact hours, a background check and passing a state or national certified licensing exam. While many career coaches have a graduate degree in counseling or accreditations, there is no universal licensing system.
 Employment-related psychology was once viewed as ''the most boring topic in psychology,'' Mr. Chope said. ''It used be seen as not 'real' mental health work.'' Now there is more recognition that job issues ''have a huge mental health component,'' he said, and a ''stronger move to understand the context of jobs, toxic co-workers and the ramifications of massive layoffs.'' 
 At the Career and Personal Development Institute, his private practice based in San Francisco, Mr. Chope works at the intersection of psychology and career counseling. And his patient base is swelling. ''We have to hire more therapists,'' he said. ''So many people want to be involved in this field right now because it's such a huge market.''
 But don't mistake career counseling for career coaching. Mr. Chope said ''career counseling is what you seek when you say to yourself, 'I'm an engineer and now I want to be a physician,' while career coaches work with individuals to market themselves, tweak their resumes, and land new jobs quickly.''
 Mr. Palumbo says he does some role-playing, practicing interviews with patients, but he draws a line. ''I'm not a career coach in the sense that I'm going to tell you what to take out and put in your resume,'' he said, ''but I will help patients examine issues surrounding insecurity and why they are tentative about selling themselves.''
 Similarly, Mr. Turkl says he isn't timid about referring a patient to a career counselor for an issue beyond the scope of his expertise: ''If a patient wants to know how to present themselves during a job interview, I'll suggest a career counselor, because that's not really what I do.''
 Still, Mr. Palumbo says employment issues can be viewed through a Freudian lens. ''A job search,'' he says, ''brings up the same issues of self-esteem and self-worth that are rooted in the dynamics of your childhood.''
 If you are unclear about whether to consult a career coach or a psychologist, you may want to consider whether emotions are looming large. ''Work and employment issues can bring some old traumas to the surface. Coaches are not necessarily trained to deal with the deep emotional stuff,'' Mr. Turkl said.
 Curt Rosengren, a career coach based in Seattle, agrees that deep-seated emotional issues are best handled by a licensed therapist. ''I fit in by helping people move forward'' to the future they see for themselves,'' he said. ''I have no training to address what was about it your childhood that got you here.''
 Katherine Crowley, a psychotherapist specializing in employment issues, says people who need help positioning themselves and updating resumes should see a traditional career coach. By contrast, ''I'm most helpful to individuals who want to integrate their emotional well-being into their work life,'' she said.
 PENELOPE TRUNK, chief executive of Brazen Careerist, a Web service that helps companies find job candidates, has been to both a therapist and a career coach -- experiences that have informed her opinion that each deals with different territory.
 ''A lot of career coaching is specific,'' she said. ''A psychologist cannot get you out of middle management.''
 Ms. Trunk went to see a career coach when she was in her 20s, on the advice of the board of the company where she was chief operating officer. ''They wanted me to look more confident and carry myself with more authority,'' she said.
 In a March 2007 blog post on the topic, she wrote: ''The coach gave me a list of things to change. When I walked, for example, I walked 'high,' with a bounce, and didn't give off a sense of being grounded. She told me to look at the C.E.O. 'He has a deliberate, grounded walk -- no bounce. It instills confidence.' She told me I smiled too much.'' 
 When Ms. Trunk started to feel uncomfortable with her level of authority, she made an appointment with a psychologist. After a few months of therapy, Ms. Trunk said, ''the solid gait and serious face'' came more naturally.

HEADLINE: It's No Time to Stop This Train

BYLINE: By ALAN S. BLINDER. 
Alan S. Blinder is a professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton and former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve. He has advised many Democratic politicians.

 BODY:
CONTRARY to what you may have heard from some doomsayers, 2009 is not 1930 redux. What we must guard against, instead, is 2010 or 2011 becoming another 1936.
 Realistically, there is little danger that the economy is heading toward a repeat performance of the Great Depression -- when real gross domestic product in the United States declined 27 percent and unemployment soared to 25 percent. What we have is bad enough: our worst recession since the 1930s. But unless our leaders behave unbelievably foolishly, we will not repeat the tragic slide into the abyss of 1930 to 1933 -- for two main reasons.
First, our economy has many built-in safeguards that did not exist back then -- like unemployment insurance, Social Security and federal deposit insurance, to name just three. These programs serve as safety nets that cushion the fall. And while they are certainly not strong enough to prevent recessions, they should be enough to prevent another depression. 
 The more important reason is that Barack Obama, Timothy F. Geithner and Ben S. Bernanke are not Herbert Hoover, Andrew Mellon and Eugene Meyer. (Who's that? Mr. Meyer was the Federal Reserve chairman from September 1930 to May 1933.) In stark contrast to the laissez-faire crowd that ruled the roost in 1930 and 1931, our current economic leaders are not waiting for the sagging economy to right itself. Rather, they have taken numerous extraordinary steps already -- and stand ready to do more if necessary.
 That's the good news. But even if another depression is next to impossible, there is still the danger that next year, or the year after, might turn into 1936. Let me explain.
 From its bottom in 1933 to 1936, the G.D.P. climbed spectacularly (albeit from a very low base), averaging gains of almost 11 percent a year. But then, both the Fed and the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt reversed course.
 In the summer of 1936, the Fed looked at the large volume of excess reserves piled up in the banking system, concluded that this mountain of liquidity could be fodder for future inflation, and began to withdraw it. This tightening of monetary policy continued into 1937, in a weak economy that was ill-prepared for it.
 About the same time, President Roosevelt looked at what seemed to be enormous federal budget deficits, concluded that it was time to put the nation's fiscal house in order and started raising taxes and reducing spending. This tightening of fiscal policy transformed the federal budget from a deficit of 3.8 percent of G.D.P. in 1936 to a surplus of 0.2 percent of G.D.P. in 1937 -- a swing of four percentage points in a single year. (Today, a swing that large would be almost $600 billion.)
 Thus, both monetary and fiscal policies did an abrupt about-face in 1936 and 1937, and the consequences were as predictable as they were tragic. The United States economy, which had been rapidly climbing out of the cellar from 1933 to 1936, was kicked rudely down the stairs again, and America experienced the so-called recession within the depression. Real G.D.P. contracted 3.4 percent from 1937 to 1938; the total G.D.P. decline during the recession, which lasted from mid-1937 to mid-1938, was even larger. 
 The moral of the story should be clear: Prematurely changing fiscal and monetary policies -- from stepping hard on the accelerator to slamming on the brake -- can be hazardous to the economy's health.
 Wow, we've learned a lot since the '30s, right? Well, maybe not. For the echoes of 1936 are being heard right now, even before the current recession hits bottom.
 If you've been paying attention, you know that a number of critics of the Fed are sounding alarms over the huge stockpile of excess reserves it has created -- more than $775 billion at last count. What these critics are fretting about now is exactly what goaded the Fed into action in 1936: that the vast pool of loose money will ultimately be inflationary. The clear inference is that some of it should be withdrawn before it's too late.
 On the fiscal side, many of President Obama's critics are complaining vociferously about the huge federal budget deficits. Try to ignore, if you can, the sheer hypocrisy of many Congressional Republicans who, having never uttered a peep about the huge deficits under George W. Bush, are suddenly models of budget probity. But whatever the motives, the worries of today's deficit hawks sound eerily reminiscent of Roosevelt in 1936 and 1937.
 FORTUNATELY, Mr. Bernanke is a keen student of the Great Depression who will not allow the Fed to repeat the errors of 1936-37. But his critics, both inside and outside the Fed, are already branding his policies as dangerously inflationary, and no Fed chairman wants to be called an inflationist.
 Similarly, I hope and believe that President Obama will not transform himself from the spendthrift Roosevelt of 1933 to the deficit-hawk Roosevelt of 1936 -- at least not until the economy is back on solid ground. That said, a growing flock of budget hawks are already showing their talons. They will have their day -- but please, not yet.
 To avoid a replay of the policy disasters of 1936-37, both the Fed and our elected officials must stay the course. Mark Twain once explained that, while history does not repeat itself, it often rhymes. We don't want any rhymes just now.

HEADLINE: Atlantic City Hold 'Em

BYLINE: By AMY CORTESE

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY 

 BODY:
 ON a recent afternoon, the sun broke out above the soggy boardwalk here, but fog still swirled around a tower rising from a base of curved glass on the north end, the site of the city's 12th, and most ambitious, casino resort project. 
 Kevin DeSanctis, the chief executive of the Revel Entertainment Group, which is building the $2 billion complex, was walking visitors through the vast location. Wearing a construction hat and a bright orange vest, he pointed out features that would someday take shape: a 140-foot glass atrium, 1,800 hotel rooms, 20 restaurants, a spa and fitness center, 75,000 square feet of retail space, three theaters, 160,000 square feet of meeting space, an 8,000-car garage, indoor and outdoor pools and cabanas -- all planned along a 1,000-foot-long stretch of oceanfront property. 
 The resort, Revel's first, symbolizes Atlantic City's latest hopes of transforming itself, Las Vegas-like, from a down-at-the-heels haven for day-tripping gamblers to a full-fledged destination for dining, shopping, spas and other nongambling amenities. 
 The city, in fact, has made impressive strides toward that goal. In 2003, the opening of the upscale Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa, owned by MGM Mirage and Boyd Gaming, kicked off a building frenzy. Opened last year alone were the Water Club, Borgata's standalone luxury hotel; the Chairman Tower at Trump Taj Mahal; the Chelsea, a boutique hotel; a Courtyard by Marriott; and the Waterfront Tower at Harrah's Resort. Collectively, the properties add 2,800 hotel rooms, and feature restaurants by marquee names like Bobby Flay and Stephen Starr, along with spas and shops. 
 But these days, Atlantic City's momentum has stalled. In a particularly potent double-whammy, the city must deal with a deep recession and increased competition from neighboring states that offer gambling, including Pennsylvania, Connecticut and New York. The Sands Casino Resort in Bethlehem, Pa., which will offer only slot machines, is set to open this month. ''This downturn has been a real kick in the teeth'' for Atlantic City, said Joseph Weinert, a senior vice president at the Spectrum Gaming Group, a research firm. ''All the progress was just stopped dead in its tracks.'' 
 Jeffrey S. Vasser, the president of the Atlantic City Convention and Visitors Authority, acknowledged that ''if someone simply wants to pull a lever on a slot machine, they can do that from anywhere now.'' 
 Atlantic City casinos' gambling revenue slid 16.2 percent in the first quarter, versus the year-earlier period, and fell 7.6 for all of 2008, compared with 2007, according to the New Jersey Casino Control Authority. Nongambling revenue, meanwhile, constitutes just 20 percent of the casinos' total revenue, compared with 60 percent for Las Vegas.
 And some big projects have stalled. Just a couple of years ago, city officials were boasting about plans for three major casinos, totaling $10 billion in investment, by MGM Mirage, Pinnacle Entertainment and Revel. Only Revel continues to go forward.
 But even that project has endured some setbacks. In January, Mr. DeSanctis, the chief executive, halted work on the interior until further financing is obtained, and laid off 40 percent of his workers. He says he has sufficient financing from Morgan Stanley, his partner in the project, to complete construction of the exterior. A foundation platform holds the place of a second tower he hopes to complete in the future. 
 The problems go beyond a lack of credit. With gambling numbers declining and competition increasing, Atlantic City suddenly looks risky. ''When someone is building a multibillion-dollar property, they want to know it is going to make money,'' said Kim Townsend, the chief executive of Pinnacle's development in Atlantic City. 
 Pinnacle, which is based in Las Vegas, had planned to build a $2 billion casino-hotel on 15 acres it acquired in Atlantic City, including the site of the old Sands Casino Hotel. The Sands was imploded in October 2007. A year later, the company announced that the project, its first in Atlantic City, would be put on indefinite hold. 
 Ms. Townsend, a casino industry veteran who grew up near Atlantic City, has kept busy opening a restaurant on the boardwalk on a site the company owns, and opening Pinnacle's new River City Casino in St. Louis, one of three smaller casinos it is planning.
 MGM Mirage's proposed casino, on land adjacent to the Borgata, was to be a $5 billion East Coast bookend to its Las Vegas CityCenter hotel-casino complex. The project was halted last fall as the debt-laden MGM Mirage struggled to raise capital to salvage its Las Vegas project. MGM recently received an injection of equity capital from Dubai World, an arm of the Dubai government, that will allow the $8.6 billion project in Las Vegas to move forward, but there are currently no plans to develop the Atlantic City property. 
 In addition, at least 20 residential luxury condominium projects have been shelved, according to Mitchell Zitomer, a vice president at Zitomer Real Estate in Margate, N.J.
 After a trying winter, Ms. Townsend said, ''everyone is anxiously waiting to see how the summer goes.'' That's when the bulk of the city's visitors come to spend money.
 New transportation options could help bring in the crowds. In March, three casinos joined together to start the Atlantic City Express Service, or ACE, a direct train service between New York and Atlantic City operated by New Jersey Transit. 
 The real key to Atlantic City's success, however, will be attracting a broader audience interested in more than gambling, the way Las Vegas has done. Area boosters are cheering for the Revel development.
 ''Everybody is excited about Revel,'' said Mr. Vasser, of the city's convention and visitors authority. ''In this economy, it's nice to have something to point to that says we're still moving.'' 
 Mr. DeSanctis acknowledges the difficult task ahead as he tries to raise more money to complete his resort. But he says he believes in Atlantic City. 
 ''A lot of people are concerned about Atlantic City, but with 47 million adults within 300 miles of here,'' he said, the potential is there if you give them a reason to visit. ''The question is, when you wake up the second day, after gambling for the evening, what do you do?'' 
 Still, Mr. DeSanctis believes that the days of multibillion-dollar casino developments fueled by high-leverage lending may be over. ''If we're lucky enough to get this project done, projects of this scale and size won't happen again in Atlantic City,'' he said. ''People will have to rethink how they approach development.''

HEADLINE: The Housing Crisis: Getting a Ground-Level View

 BODY:
With anecdotal evidence suggesting the number of foreclosures was accelerating in the New York metropolitan area, The New York Times set out to try to quantify the extent of the problem -- not just from a regional or county-level view, but down to the street level. 
 After acquiring data that included the property addresses for more than 182,000 homes in foreclosure between January 2005 and August 2008, The Times used mapping software to plot the foreclosed properties and then computed the percentage of residential properties in foreclosure at various geographic levels. In addition, The Times also examined bank data since August for New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, which showed a sharp increase in the number of monthly mortgage payments at least 90 days past due. 
 Over all, the analysis of the data found a regionwide crisis rooted most strikingly in black and Hispanic neighborhoods, where default rates are soaring and homeowners are four times more likely to hold expensive subprime mortgages than whites with similar incomes. For an in-depth look at the data and the questions raised about the practice known as reverse redlining, go to nytimes.com/longisland.
 No one company or government agency had or was willing to provide complete address-level foreclosure records for the region surrounding New York City, so The Times acquired and standardized address-level data from: The Warren Group in Connecticut; the county clerk in Westchester County; The Long Island Real Estate Report; PropertyShark.com in New York City; and American Foreclosures, publishers of NJLisPendens.com. Also used in the analysis was residential property data from Western Technologies Group in New Jersey, the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University and the New York Office of Real Property Services.
 Mortgage delinquency data came from First American CoreLogic, which compiles loan performance data from the nation's largest servicers and from all Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac primary lien outstanding loans.
 Because the foreclosure crisis is closely tied to the large numbers of high-cost mortgage loans written between 2005 and 2007, the newspaper also analyzed national mortgage lending data collected for those years under the terms of the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act.

HEADLINE: Bankers Bounce Back

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
There are probably good reasons to give Richard Fuld a job at the hedge fund Matrix Advisors. He is familiar with byzantine financial products: Lehman Brothers, the bank he used to run, gorged on them until it collapsed. He might know them enough to be more careful around them the next time. 
 Still, I can't get over just how flawlessly bankers bounce. Charles Prince, fired for steering Citigroup toward financial collapse, found a new job as vice chairman of Stonebridge, a consultancy firm. Stanley O'Neal, who was given a $161 million parachute before being dumped for leading the toxic asset binge at Merrill Lynch, just joined the board of American Beacon Advisors, a financial advisory company. I wonder whether it wouldn't be a better choice for these men to take a break. 
 People's sense of justice is anchored to an expectation that providence will ultimately mete out retribution to those who wrong us. It doesn't necessarily require an eye to be taken for an eye. But the public outrage over the multimillion-dollar bonuses paid to the financial wizards at A.I.G. suggests that people have trouble absorbing bankers' uncanny ability to keep landing in finance's glittering fold while regular mortals are left to suffer from the economic fallout they unleashed. 
 Sure, the United States prides itself on being the land of second chances. But the desire to punish wrongdoing runs deep. Evolutionary biologists suggest it was necessary for the flourishing of altruism -- the willingness to share resources even at personal cost -- which otherwise would have been driven out of the gene pool by egoists who would have hogged all resources and starved the selfless. 
 Today, public anger requires government officials to publicly excoriate bankers every time the government gives the banks more public money. If the banks need even more, President Obama will have to figure out a way to brave that fury. 
 Given the raw feelings, it wouldn't hurt if one or two of the current crop of jobless bankers went off to distribute malaria nets in Africa or teach math in an inner-city high school. They could even use some of their money. Michael Milken set up a foundation and started a think tank, and today a lot of people think of him as a philanthropist rather than as the junk bond king who was jailed for securities fraud. For the next couple of years, maybe, I would also stay away from shorting G.M. or cornering oil futures.

HEADLINE: Rodriguez Didn't Tip Pitches, Numbers Indicate

BYLINE: By DAN ROSENHECK. 
E-mail: keepingscore@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The most damaging allegation in Selena Roberts's new book on Alex Rodriguez had nothing to do with steroids. Rodriguez's use of performance-enhancing drugs certainly counts as cheating, but an argument can be made that his team was the beneficiary. The same cannot be said of Roberts's claim that Rodriguez tipped pitches to opposing middle infielders when they were batting in blowouts, using visual signals to let them know what was coming with the expectation that they would return the favor. 
 Although the Rangers' record was probably not affected if Rodriguez did what Roberts asserts in ''A-Rod: The Many Lives of Alex Rodriguez,'' that doesn't mean the supposed tipping was a victimless crime. The statistics of the hurlers whose pitches were being given away were likely to suffer. And given that relievers summoned in the late innings of laughers tend to be the worst members of a team's staff, every extra hit they allow can potentially mean a demotion to the minor leagues. 
 Most of the attention given to the issue so far has focused on whether Rodriguez really participated in tipping schemes. But nearly as important as the question of intent, if not more important, is that of effect: whether the arrangements actually made any difference. Were Rodriguez's gaudy Texas stats actually inflated by suspicious offensive outbursts at the tail ends of blowouts? And did rival second basemen and shortstops show a similar pattern?
 To provide an answer, one must first define which game situations the tipping was likely to take place in, versus those in which no foul play would be suspected. Roberts does not specify how far out of reach a game had to be before Rodriguez would have broken out his signals. But if such a pattern did exist, it should be fairly easy to detect using a statistical tool called Leverage Index. Developed by Tom Tango, the author of ''The Book: Playing the Percentages in Baseball,'' Leverage Index is a quantitative measure of how important any particular moment in a game is to the outcome. A hit when the L.I. is 1 (the first batter of the game) has one-third the impact of the same hit when the L.I. is 3 (for example, bases loaded and none out in the top of the fifth, with the home team leading by two), and three times the significance of that hit when the L.I. is 0.33 (bases empty and two outs in the bottom of the sixth with the visitors leading by four).
 If a tipping conspiracy were in place, one would expect that Rodriguez and rival middle infielders in games he played to have hit better in low-leverage situations than in high-leverage ones. Using a fairly loose definition of high leverage as a L.I. above 1.5 and low leverage as below 0.7, the data provide a resounding answer: either no tipping was going on or it was pathetically ineffective. 
 Contrary to his reputation as a choker, Rodriguez was actually at his best when the game was on the line as a Ranger. According to data compiled by Sean Forman of Baseball-Reference.com, his combined on-base and slugging percentages (O.P.S.) from 2001 to 2003 was 1.076 in high-leverage situations, compared with 1.017 for medium leverage and .982 in low leverage. Opposing second basemen and shortstops showed the same pattern. They registered an .899 O.P.S. when leverage was high, .825 when it was middling, and .817 when it was low. Unless Rodriguez's behavior was even more nefarious -- tipping only when it mattered most -- the numbers give no reason to believe he was involved.
 Using a more stringent definition of blowouts yields the same result. In plate appearances in which the teams were separated by seven runs or more, Rodriguez mustered just a .851 O.P.S., compared with 1.021 when the margin was six or fewer runs. His middle infield counterparts compiled a .744 mark in the laughers and .840 the rest of the time.
 In recent years, analysts have increasingly used statistics to hunt for malfeasance. From research by the University of Chicago economist Steven Levitt into match-fixing in sumo wrestling to the investigation of point-shaving in college basketball by Justin Wolfers of the University of Pennsylvania, these forensic economists have uncovered compelling evidence that competition in sports is not always aboveboard. But the tools of the trade can be deployed just as effectively to demonstrate innocence as guilt. Rodriguez's opponents have every right to demonize him for his steroid use, but his former Texas teammates have nothing to complain about.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 19, 2009

 CORRECTION:
A headline for the Keeping Score column on Sunday, about an analysis of the assertion in a new book that Alex Rodriguez revealed pitches to opposing middle infielders to let them know what was coming with the expectation that they would return the favor, referred incorrectly to the findings. As the column reported, the numbers show that either no so-called tipping of pitches occurred or that it was ineffective; the numbers did not ''indicate'' that ''Rodriguez didn't tip pitches.''

HEADLINE: Economy Woes Shake Up Campaign for California Governor as Voters Seek Answers

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER and JESSE McKINLEY; Jennifer Steinhauer reported from Los Angeles, and Jesse McKinley from San Francisco.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
If a campaign consultant were in search of a billable candidate in the inchoate race to succeed Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, it might seem sensible to seek out a Democrat.
 Democrats hold a whopping advantage in registered voters in California, and President Obama beat Senator John McCain here by 24 percentage points last fall. Republicans seeking statewide office have largely gotten clobbered in recent years, and the party's standard-bearer -- Mr. Schwarzenegger, barred by term limits from running for re-election -- has one of the lowest approval ratings for a governor in nearly 25 years. 
 But the dynamics of the 2010 race, which has come into full swing in recent weeks, are already proving to be topsy-turvy, with Democrats trying to buck a gubernatorial slump against a millionaire-peppered group of moderate Republicans.
 Many voters in California, despondent over the state's dire fiscal straits, high unemployment and stream of businesses flowing to other states, say they value competence and solutions more than party affiliation or celebrity. 
 ''What the voters will be looking for in this election is someone who has some answers,'' said Bruce E. Cain, a professor of political science at the University of California, Berkeley. ''I do not remember the morale of the state being so low.'' 
 That malaise seems to infuse even those running for governor, a job whose innate challenges (including a population of nearly 39 million) are made all the more difficult by a State Constitution that requires a two-thirds vote by lawmakers to pass a budget or a tax increase and by a ballot initiative system that allows voters to set their own rules with just a simple majority.
 ''It's not much of career builder; it's more of a career ender,'' said Jerry Brown, 71, the state's attorney general, who was governor from 1975 to 1983. ''But I feel I could bear that better than the other candidates.''
 In addition to Mr. Brown -- who has yet to declare his candidacy formally but has not been shy about his desire to run -- the Democratic field includes Mayor Gavin Newsom of San Francisco, who is madly trying to Twitter his way beyond the single issue of same-sex marriage, which has so far defined him. His friendly counterpart to the south, meanwhile, Mayor Antonio R. Villaraigosa of Los Angeles, has been coy about his intentions -- he ducked the state party's convention this month -- but has a reputation for jumping into races at the last minute. (State Treasurer Bill Lockyer has been floated as a possible dark horse.)
 Mr. Brown, Mr. Newsom and Mr. Villaraigosa all have high-profile jobs but an uphill battle in front of them. Democrats have lost six of the last eight races for governor, including a 2003 recall, despite having a lock on most other statewide offices. 
 ''Any Democrat who thinks that Republicans have no chance in this race should take a look at recent history,'' said Garry South, a Democratic consultant who is working on the Newsom campaign.
 On the Republican side are two Silicon Valley millionaires -- a former eBay chief executive, Meg Whitman, and the state's insurance commissioner, Steven Poizner, the only Republican to win a statewide office in the last election. They are joined by Tom Campbell, a former congressman who flies below most voters' radar screens. 
 The Republicans have been focused on taxes and the state's regulatory environment, which they suggest combine to drive companies out of the state, as well as on job creation, though they have offered few specific plans. They are also presenting themselves as a check on the power of the Democrats, who control both houses of the State Legislature. 
 ''In the general election our point will be, 'Do you want just one party in charge?' '' Mr. Campbell said.
 Democrats are hoping to capitalize on Mr. Obama's popularity here and on his campaign's inroads in drawing young people to the polls. Mr. Newsom, 41, in particular, has been angling for younger voters, announcing his candidacy via Twitter. (He claims 400,000 followers and says he posts ''90 percent'' of his own tweets.) 
 At the same time, Mr. Newsom, who made a tidy fortune as the founder of Plumpjack, a wine, lodging and restaurant group, is also looking to pump up his moderate, pro-business credentials with more conservative voters who might be skeptical of his well-publicized embrace of same-sex marriage and his liberal San Francisco pedigree. 
 ''I'm a pro-job Democrat,'' he said. ''I've been very progressive when it comes to social issues and pragmatic when it comes to business.''
 Most of the candidates agree that social issues will probably play only a small role in the election because of the state's economic plight.
 ''I don't think social issues are the core burning problem facing the state,'' Mr. Poizner said.
 Candidates from both parties also seem to agree that it is a good idea to distance themselves from Mr. Schwarzenegger, whose popularity has slipped as the state has been buffeted by recession, high foreclosure rates and chronic budget battles. That includes Mr. Villaraigosa, even though he continues to make appearances with Mr. Schwarzenegger. 
 ''He is doing as good a job as he can do,'' said Mr. Villaraigosa, adding that the only way to get California back on track is ''to make fundamental changes to the way we govern.''
 That might include seemingly radical solutions like calling a constitutional convention to consider changing some provisions, including the two-thirds rule in the State Legislature.
 Republicans are also looking to present themselves as reformers. 
 Mr. Poizner, for example, who got rich running technology companies, is positioning himself as the only Republican with business credentials who has demonstrated that he can win statewide office. Mr. Poizner is also pushing education reform, favoring a large expansion of charter schools. ''I am going to be very specific,'' he said. ''And it will drive my political consultants nuts.'' 
 Likewise, Ms. Whitman seems to be striking an outsider attitude, saying she wants to bring her experiences at eBay to bear on the state's budget. 
 ''I want to run Sacramento a bit more like a business,'' she said. ''We have a government we can't afford.'' 
 Mr. Campbell, a business professor at the University of California, Berkeley, seems to strike a more placid tone and says he can easily work with a Democratic-controlled Legislature. ''Oh gosh, yes I can!'' he said. 
 Such post-partisanship was supposed to be a hallmark of Mr. Schwarzenegger's second term, which he began in 2007 with a call for ''the party of California'' to come together to fix the state. Two years later, however, the consensus is that despite all the potential takers, running the State of California is a miserable job. 
 ''Most governors leave discredited and unpopular,'' said Mr. Brown, who at this early point in the contest is leading among Democrats in most polls.

HEADLINE: India's Governing Coalition Scores Decisive Victory in Parliamentary Races

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA; Hari Kumar contributed reporting.

DATELINE: NEW DELHI 

 BODY:
The governing coalition led by the Indian National Congress sailed to a surprisingly decisive victory in India's grueling parliamentary elections, vaulting Manmohan Singh, a soft-spoken economic reformer, to a second term as prime minister, and sweeping away the prospect of political instability in the world's most populous democracy. 
 Mr. Singh, 77, called the victory ''a massive mandate'' on Saturday afternoon, hours after the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party conceded defeat. The victory, in what is apparently a Congress landslide, signals the possibility of a stable and strong government in the face of stiff challenges: a sharp slowdown in economic growth, abiding poverty and instability in the region. 
 It also sidelines a slew of small, regional party bosses whose influence had steadily grown in Indian national politics, and potentially cuts down the power of Communists who had blocked economic reforms for most of Mr. Singh's first five-year term. 
 The Congress Party's showing vindicates the prime minister's efforts to deepen a strategic partnership with the United States at a time when the Obama administration is deeply concerned about security in the region, chiefly in Pakistan and Afghanistan. A stronger government will also be better able to tackle issues of crucial importance to Washington, from economic reforms to climate change, although there is not necessarily agreement with the Americans on how to proceed.
 By early evening, the Election Commission of India projected that the Congress-led alliance would win 259 of 543 parliamentary seats, while the opposition B.J.P.-led alliance was expected to take 160 seats, and a third alliance, dominated by Communists, 63. Congress alone was projected to win over 200 seats. Results were not yet final, but the government had finished counting ballots for 55 percent of the seats. 
 The projections are expected to dispel the fears of investors and analysts abroad. A smaller vote share for the Congress coalition would have almost surely led to protracted and painful political horse-trading with groups it would have been forced to ally with and engendered a weak government. The coalition will need partners to form a parliamentary majority, but it will not be nearly as dependent as it has been on allies with whom it disagrees. 
 Still, the seemingly large mandate also brings large expectations from various constituencies in a nation of 1.1 billion people, a third of whom remain among the poorest in the world. 
 The Confederation of Indian Industry called for reforms to be ''fast tracked'' along with investments in infrastructure to revive the economy. That could swell an already ballooning deficit and harm the country's credit ratings. 
 But the party will also be beholden to the majority of Indians. Congress had campaigned on its record of spending on the rural poor, including a huge public jobs program in the countryside and a costly loan waiver program for indebted farmers. 
 The margin of victory surprised even party officials. ''It exceeded our wildest expectations,'' Jairam Ramesh, a Congress Party strategist, said in an interview in the party headquarters, as workers beat drums and set off firecrackers in the sizzling midday heat. Throughout the afternoon, Congress politicians trailed into the official residence of the party president, Sonia Gandhi, bearing giant bouquets. 
 At a somber and largely empty B.J.P. office, Arun Jaitley, a party leader, accepted defeat early in the day. ''Something certainly did go wrong,'' he told reporters. The party, which has a vocal Hindu nationalist base, had sought to capitalize on the incumbent Congress-led government's handling of the economic downturn and terrorist attacks during its tenure. 
 The party's new star was also its most controversial member: Feroze Varun Gandhi, an estranged member of the Nehru-Gandhi family, who had been jailed for making anti-Muslim speeches and was released on bail. He won by a large margin. 
 Among the biggest losers in the vote were the four separate Communist parties on whom the incumbent Congress-led coalition initially relied to stay in power. The four parties had successfully blocked several reform measures, including privatizing more state-owned companies. The Communists eventually withdrew their support, over a nuclear deal with the United States last July.
 For Congress, the Communists' weak performance brought sweet relief. ''The left will not have a stranglehold,'' Mr. Ramesh said. ''There will be better cohesion on economic policy. Right now, the priority is to restore high economic growth.'' 
 How fast the next Congress-led administration will further liberalize the economy is unclear. In the face of the global financial crisis, Congress leaders are not likely to want to open up India's banking and insurance sectors, for instance, although they could reduce interest rates and increase infrastructure spending. 
 The election results, though preliminary, defied several commonplace assumptions. Several commentators had rued the absence of big ideas in these elections, yet Indians went to the polls in droves in the scorching heat. At nearly 60 percent, election turnout was higher than in 2004. There had also been widespread fears that small, regional parties might upstage the national parties or demand influential government portfolios in exchange for their support. But they remained small and regional, and some of them appear to have been trounced. 
 Ramachandra Guha, a historian of modern India, saw in that perhaps another important shift in the political landscape. After 20 years of the once-dominant Congress Party being challenged by the ascendance of small identity-based parties, these elections suggested something of a course correction, he said. 
 Not least, these elections were a test of credibility for Rahul Gandhi, 38, the fourth-generation scion of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty and his party's inevitable leader. He became his party's star campaigner in these elections, crisscrossing the country and attending an average of four campaign rallies a day for more than a month. 
 Renouncing personal power is a powerful political gesture in India, and the Nehru-Gandhi family has used it deftly. Five years ago, when Congress won a surprise victory, Sonia Gandhi renounced the prime minister's post, bequeathing it to the professorial Mr. Singh. On Saturday, Mrs. Gandhi insisted that the top job should remain with Mr. Singh, rather than go to her son.
 With a knowing smile, Mr. Singh told reporters that he would continue to try to persuade Mr. Gandhi to join his cabinet.

HEADLINE: Capitalism's Fault Lines

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RAUCH. 
Jonathan Rauch is a senior writer with National Journal and a guest scholar at the Brookings Institution.

 BODY:
A FAILURE OF CAPITALISM
 The Crisis of '08 and the Descent Into Depression
 By Richard A. Posner
 346 pp. Harvard University Press. $23.95
 ''This recession,'' President Obama said recently, ''was not caused by a normal downturn in the business cycle. It was caused by a perfect storm of irresponsibility and poor decision-making that stretched from Wall Street to Washington to Main Street.'' Richard A. Posner is having none of it. A perfect storm, yes: but a storm of responsibility and reasonable decision-making. The Crash of '08 happened because businesspeople and consumers did what markets and society expect them to do. Don't blame capitalists or, for the most part, government. Blame capitalism. 
 It comes as something of a surprise that Posner, a doyen of the market-oriented law-and-economics movement, should deliver a roundhouse punch to the proposition that markets are self-correcting. It might also seem odd that a federal appellate judge (and University of Chicago law lecturer) would be among the first out of the gate with a comprehensive book on the financial crisis -- if, that is, the judge were any other judge. But Posner is the late Daniel Patrick Moynihan's successor as the country's most omnivorous and independent-minded public intellectual. By now, his dozens of books just about fill their own wing in the Library of Congress.
 In ''Catastrophe: Risk and Response'' (2004), he took up the problem of low-probability, high-impact events. The financial meltdown certainly qualifies. In this compact and bracingly lucid volume, he offers a simple, but not simplistic, primer: ''a concise, constructive, jargon- and acronym-free, nontechnical, unsensational, light-on-anecdote, analytical examination of the major facets of the biggest U.S. economic disaster in my lifetime and that of most people living today.''
 If you read the newspapers, you will not see much in ''A Failure of Capitalism'' by way of unfamiliar particulars. Cheap money and an inrush of foreign capital fueled a lending boom, which poured credit into the housing market. As prices went up, up, up, even risky mortgages seemed safe and everyone piled in, including banks. Financiers relied on securitization and complicated financial instruments to dilute the attendant risk, but the result was to spread that risk through the financial system, making it impossible to locate. When the housing bubble popped, everyone was holding bad debt, but no one was sure how bad or even how much. With banks suddenly looking undercapitalized, lenders stopped lending and started selling assets to raise cash. The faster everyone ran for the exits, the faster asset prices fell, dragging banks' balance sheets down with them. Credit markets seized up, depressing the economy, causing more mortgage defaults and asset-price deflation, further weakening banks, further paralyzing credit, depressing the economy still more. . . . Repeat ad nauseam.
 You know that story, and Posner tells it well, with a particular flair for showing how dozens of moving parts interacted. Being Richard Posner, however, he is not content to be an amiable guide through the thicket. His real interest is in finding and detonating grenades in the underbrush.
 One is right there on the title page, which flaunts the D-word. The current crisis, Posner maintains, is a depression. True, it is not (we hope) a great depression. But the typical postwar recession is a partly self-correcting disinflationary contraction that soon subsides, often leaving the economy healthier. The present downturn is a self-sustaining deflationary contraction whose costly aftereffects will linger for years. The Great Depression led to World War II. Today's depression presumably won't be that bad, but it may cause a huge loss of output, an immense increase in the national debt, a swing to excessive regulation, a nasty bout of inflation, a decline in America's economic and geopolitical power, and increased political instability abroad.
 A typical recession is a market correction, usually of inflation or other economic imbalances; a depression is a market failure. And it is a failure (here is grenade No. 2) that the market is powerless to prevent. ''An interrelated system of financial intermediaries'' -- a banking system, broadly defined -- ''is inherently unstable,'' Posner writes. Think of it as ''a kind of epileptic, subject to unpredictable, strange seizures.''
 Populists and libertarians will hate this book, though I wouldn't want to predict which group will hate it more. A perfect storm of irresponsibility? Hardly. The crisis came about precisely because intelligent businesses and consumers followed market signals. ''The mistakes were systemic -- the product of the nature of the banking business in an environment shaped by low interest rates and deregulation rather than the antics of crooks and fools.'' 
 Were a lot of people reckless and stupid? Of course! But that cannot explain why the whole system crashed, since a lot of people are always reckless and stupid. The problem, fundamentally, is that markets cannot, and rationally should not, anticipate their own collapse. ''A depression is too remote an event to influence business behavior.'' Any single business can rationally guard against its own bankruptcy, but not the simultaneous bankruptcy of everybody else. ''The profit-maximizing businessman rationally ignores small probabilities that his conduct in conjunction with that of his competitors may bring down the entire economy.''
 During the housing bubble, for example, sitting out the mortgage boom meant forgoing large profits. ''Even if you know you're riding a bubble and are scared to be doing so,'' Posner writes, ''it is difficult to climb off without paying a big price.'' So people made decisions that were individually rational but collectively irrational. To see the crisis through populist spectacles, as President Obama does when he attributes it to ''irresponsibility,'' is to misunderstand the whole problem by blaming capitalists for a failure of capitalism.
 And so -- here is the part libertarians will hate -- markets, entirely of their own accord, will sometimes capsize and be unable to right themselves completely for years at a stretch. (See: Japan, ''lost decade'' of.) Nor can monetary policy be counted on to counteract markets' tippy tendencies, as so many economists had come to believe.
 Alas, economists and policy makers got cocksure. They thought they had consigned depressions to history. As a result, they missed warning signs and failed to prepare for the worst. ''We are learning,'' Posner writes, ''that we need a more active and intelligent government to keep our model of a capitalist economy from running off the rails.'' 
 By doing what, exactly? Posner thinks laissez-faire economics has nothing relevant to say. The rest of the economics profession is all over the map. The system of financial regulation will need an overhaul, but Posner argues that the time for that is not now, in the heat of crisis. Anyway, no one is sure what to do. He halfheartedly suggests a few reforms but concedes they are ''pretty small beer.'' If pressed, I suspect, he might also acknowledge some 20-20 hindsight in his insistence that the government should have prepared for an event that hardly anyone thought possible.
 By the last page, not a single lazy generalization has survived Posner's merciless scrutiny, not one populist cliche remains standing. ''A Failure of Capitalism'' clears away whole forests of cant but leaves readers at a loss as to where to go from here. In other words, it is only a starting point -- but an indispensable one.

HEADLINE: Suze Orman Is Having a Moment

BYLINE: By SUSAN DOMINUS. 
Susan Dominus, a frequent contributor to the magazine, writes The Times's Big City column.

 BODY:
Consumer spending may be down, but desire apparently isn't. Americans still want, they crave, they have to have. They want $8,000 sewing machines and $2,800 custom closets and $5,000 minitractors, and sometimes they reach out to Suze Orman, the ubiquitous, telegenic personal-finance expert and beg her for permission to indulge.
 Early in March, a woman called into ''The Suze Orman Show,'' one of CNBC's top draws, and told Orman that she wanted to build an outdoor kitchen. The cost: $3,000 to $5,000. Orman, sitting in the CNBC studio in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., expressed some skepticism. The name of this particular segment of the show is ''Can I Afford It?'' but Orman often plays it as ''Give Me a Good Reason Why You Need It.'' She scowled. 
 ''Why can't you just have a barbecue outside for, like, 150 bucks?'' she wanted to know. On her show, Orman often takes on the role of the family killjoy, a figure most infuriating when her logic is irrefutable. The caller ran some numbers by Orman -- her household had $30,500 in savings, which Orman seemed to think was scant, plus a car loan, a home-equity loan and a mortgage -- but Orman granted economic absolution. ''You have been approved,'' she announced.
 This was a surprise. ''What?'' someone in the control room said, shocked. Orman, a virulent antidebt crusader, typically withholds her approval in such cases.
 But she quickly returned to form. She heard next from a new mother who wanted to spend $2,000 on laser hair-removal. Orman and the woman went through a quick rundown of the numbers, including the woman's roughly $7,000 in combined monthly income.
 It wasn't clear which way Orman was going to go. ''Can I ask you a personal question?'' she said. She stared right into the camera. ''Are you really hairy?''
 The caller hedged. That was all Orman needed to hear. Denied.
 ***
 The ''Can I Afford It?'' segment has always generated thousands of requests for Orman's counsel. But since the early fall of last year, the number of requests has gone up ''exponentially,'' according to the show's executive producer, Amy Feller.
 The career of any financial adviser thrives on worry, and Orman, already the best-known financial adviser in the country, has hit the worry motherlode. In January, ''Suze Orman's 2009 Action Plan,'' a guide to the economic crisis, made the best-seller list. Around the same time, Oprah Winfrey began giving the book away free in digital form on her Web site. (After Winfrey announced the offer, the book was downloaded more than two million times in one week.) Overall viewership on ''The Suze Orman Show'' is up 22 percent from this time last year, and the urgency of the calls has increased, too. Instead of asking about what kind of mortgage makes the most sense, her viewers are calling with questions of survival like, If I have to default on one of my various lines of debt, which one should I abandon first? 
 With the change in the economic climate, Orman's role in the culture has shifted from pop finance guru to something more like a trusted national adviser. Along with Winfrey, television personalities like Matt Lauer, Anderson Cooper and Larry King regularly turn to her to make sense of the economy for their viewers. Recently even the United States government has sought her help. When the F.D.I.C. decided to run a public-service announcement reassuring Americans that their bank deposits were insured, it asked Orman to appear in the spot.
 In the ad, Orman delivers the message, followed by only a brief appearance by the F.D.I.C. chairwoman, Sheila Bair. Orman asks, ''Who cares more about your money than you, me and the F.D.I.C.?'' She wasn't paid for the work, but it's hard to imagine better promotion: ''You, me and the F.D.I.C.'' -- there was Orman, snugly situated between everyman and the federal government.
 What's most striking about Orman's frenetic, outsize celebrity is how starkly it contrasts with the sober simplicity of her message. Track your spending. Stay out of debt. Take care of your car. Look into a Roth I.R.A. Though she is larger than life and wealthy, her primary message is not about larger-than-life ambition or a sky-high entrepreneurial spirit. Orman's advice rarely sounds like ''Go West, young man.'' It sounds more like, ''Everyone should have a liquid eight-month emergency fund.''
 Orman has been propelled to fame not by her financial success, or because of any revolutionary insight about, say, index funds. Rather, she has figured out a way to channel an innate charisma and a televangelist's intensity into an otherwise bland message of fiscal responsibility. She could recite the phone book with her broad, Midwestern accent, her repetitive rhetorical flourishes, her interjections of ''Are you kidding?'' and people would still sit up and listen. There's as much Joan Rivers in her delivery as there is Deepak Chopra, and somehow, in Orman, neither part makes the other look ridiculous.
 ***
 One Wednesday in March, Orman showed up at the NBC studio in New York for an early-morning taping of MSNBC's ''Morning Joe,'' the popular news roundup, and then made a quick stop at CBS, where she was shooting a spot for ''CBS News Sunday Morning.'' 
 ''My goodness, Suze!'' said a woman who happened to be entering the building at the same time as Orman. ''It's wonderful to meet you!'' She explained that she had read all of Orman's books and was heading to work as a travel agent for CBS. 
 ''Good at what you do?'' Orman asked. 
 ''Excellent,'' she answered.
 ''That's my girl!'' Orman said and waltzed onward.
 With even the most casual encounters, Orman tends to get personal at warp speed. Later, just moments after wrapping up the filming of the CBS spot, she found herself talking with the cameraman, who, still sitting behind the camera, asked her how best to set aside money for his toddler's college fund. Orman quickly determined that he didn't have enough savings in his retirement account to satisfy her. Maybe she was tired; maybe she was just concerned. Either way, she came down hard. ''You want to save for college before you've taken care of your own home, retirement, credit card, your eight months in your emergency fund?'' she asked, still standing on the set. ''You have to put your priorities in line. You're 50? You're no spring chicken. You don't have that many years left, these things are heavy,'' she said pointing at the cameras. ''You throw your back out, where does the income come from? You're a dime a dozen.''
 Even for Orman, this was harsh, and she softened her stance. Let the kids pay their way through college if they have to, she told him, giving her advice an inspirational spin: ''You have to ask yourself, What can I do to enhance my life and teach my children that they have what it takes to do it on their own?''
 Beloved for these tough-love dressings-down, which Oprah calls ''Suze smackdowns,'' Orman says she actually never genuinely loses her patience but ''acts it up for television.'' Her real wrath, she says, is saved for the people in charge who let all those mortgages go through. But if that's true, since the meltdown she has given an Academy-Award-worthy performance of someone truly peeved by the financial recklessness of average Americans. On ''Oprah'' on Sept. 23, an episode that was shot near the peak of the credit crisis, Orman unleashed her fury on a couple featured on the show who had no health insurance, a home that was worth less than what they owed on it, had endured a layoff and were living off of 29 credit cards. 
 ''I wish I could sit here and feel sorry for you,'' Orman told the couple. ''I wish I could sit here and have some empathy, truthfully, that the fact that you lost your job, you were under stress, that you don't have health insurance for your children. You are two proud people that kept the lies going by putting your expenses for this home that you say you can afford.''
 Orman's syntax was starting to get bollixed up as she worked herself into a frenzy of indignation, letting the couple know it was high time they sold their home: ''The fact that you were never late on those credit cards because you were borrowing money from credit cards to pay other credit cards to pay your mortgage. . . . '' She raged on and on. When the wife tried to defend her behavior, Orman dismissed her arguments. ''You are talking to Suze Orman here!'' she said. 
 When I spoke to Orman months after the episode was taped, she acknowledged that she lost her cool. ''I was freaked,'' she said. ''You can tell I was freaked. I freaked Oprah out. Because I knew it was possible that by the time we came off that show that the entire United States economy could have collapsed. Our credit had frozen -- I wasn't sure we were going to be able to get money out of our A.T.M.'s. Our entire system could have come tumbling down that way. I let her have it, all this angst I was feeling about what was about to happen.'' 
 The wife, whose mouth alternated between a humiliated frown and a we're-on-TV-smile throughout the tongue-lashing, and her husband told the producers afterward that they wanted the segment edited out. (The segment ran.) It was an awkward situation for Orman, she says, ''because you better believe the producers of their show care about how their guests are treated.'' In the end Orman spent some time on the phone with the wife, explaining why she reacted as she did and giving her more detailed financial counsel. ''And it was all O.K.,'' Orman says, supremely confident as ever in her ability to help. ''She actually got more out of it in the long run.''
 ***
 Orman, who is 57, estimates her net worth at about $20 million (though even a cursory look at the numbers suggests she is worth much more than that). But like so many great evangelists, she herself was once a fallen woman, a lost soul in what would become her area of spiritual expertise. Someone channel-surfing who caught an earful of Orman scolding a debt-ridden wretch might hold her judgmental tone against her. But the devoted readers of her books and her regular fans on ''Oprah'' and QVC, where she hawks the books and other products, feel that they're hearing the zeal of the convert, the compassion of a sister who has been there.
 Orman began her career as a stockbroker in 1980 and then started her own financial-planning firm in 1987. She went into serious debt after she had a professional meltdown, a crisis of confidence that she suffered, she has written, after she was sabotaged by a former assistant. ''I had $60,000 on my Amex alone,'' she told me. She estimates that she had yet another $60,000 to $70,000 in additional credit-card debt, had mortgaged her small home to the hilt and was driving a leased BMW that required upward of $600 in monthly payments. She dipped into her 401(k), an action she currently deems a financial cardinal sin, to pay for a $7,500 Cartier Panther watch, which she wore to impress a wealthy woman she was dating at the time. 
 As is often the case in the anecdotes that fill Orman's best-selling personal-finance books (she has written nine of them), personal change started with a profound revelation followed by a drastic course of action. Sitting at a diner one evening, her Cartier watch on her wrist, she realized that the waitress probably had more money than she did. ''I knew I was nothing more than one financial liar, and that nobody had a clue what was going on behind the financial mask,'' she told me. ''If I was going to turn my life around, I had to do it with honesty.'' She started calling her closest friends and, like an addict in recovery, confessed to one after the other the truth of her situation.
 In Orman's narratives, the decision to take action is frequently followed by swift reward. ''As soon as I started to tell the truth, and everyone knew what the situation was,'' she said, ''the phone rings and it's Pacific Gas and Electric having another early retirement.'' The company hired Orman to advise its employees, and ''in one month I got a check for $250,000 and went, 'Oh, my God,' and paid off all my debt. I started getting checks like that again, and my whole life turned around.''
 The story also appears in the introduction to her third book, ''The Courage to Be Rich,'' which is effectively a parable about how those who respect money -- who are generous but not careless with it -- are rewarded with more of it. Orman writes and talks about money as if it were the fruit not just of industry, but also of honesty and charity; as if some almighty bestower of wealth kept tabs on who was naughty and who was nice.
 Her breakthrough book, ''The Nine Steps to Financial Freedom: Practical and Spiritual Steps So You Can Stop Worrying,'' came out in 1997, and a year later it gained Orman her first spot on ''Oprah.'' The text is something of a hybrid, with spiritual-sounding financial advice interspersed with more earthbound discussions of things like the comparative benefits of a Roth I.R.A. and a plain I.R.A. The prose itself reflects the book's dual sensibilities, veering from boilerplate information about loopholes to biblical-sounding injunctions. Consider Orman on the topic of giving money to parents: ''If your parents are in need and you can do this with tremendous humility, so as not to create a reverse bondage, you can give them your offering every month.''
 Something about the formula resonated with readers: the book, the most successful of Orman's, has sold more than three million copies. 
 ***
 Orman is now wealthy enough to support (presumably with great humility) her 94-year-old mother in Florida in grand style, but until she was close to 30, she usually had only just enough to get by. Her father, who raised his family on the South Side of Chicago, ran a takeout-chicken stand, bringing in far less income than most of the parents of the kids in Orman's mostly Jewish, upper-middle-class crowd.
 At 29, when Orman was working as a waitress in Berkeley, Calif., a group of regulars raised $50,000 for her to open a restaurant, a dream she had confessed to one or two of them. On the advice of a stockbroker from Merrill Lynch, she invested the money, and she promptly watched it evaporate. Convinced that if her lousy stockbroker could get a job at Merrill Lynch, she could, too, she talked her way into a job there.
 The way Orman spends her own money seems to reflect experience with both poverty and great wealth. Extravagance and frugality run up against each other. With her partner, Kathy Travis, she bought an apartment at the Plaza in Manhattan in late 2007 -- paying top dollar near the peak of the market -- but their apartment is in other respects quite modest: a 1,275-square-foot one-bedroom in which they installed a Murphy bed. She owns a compact condo in Florida that is on the beach, but when she and Travis host a large family Thanksgiving every year, there aren't enough beds for all the relatives. ''They sleep on AeroBeds,'' Orman explains.
 Even one of Orman's trademark stories about learning to be frugal -- the anecdote of the Cartier watch -- ends with an extravagant gesture. What did she ultimately do with the watch? When she started making money again, Orman told me: ''Every time I looked at that watch, it reminded me of my stupidity and how powerless I was, and how I was doing things for the wrong reasons. I didn't want it around me. I didn't care that it had doubled in value. I was at a friend's house one day, and she was admiring the watch, and I took it off and said, 'Here, it's yours.' Just a friend. 'Here, you take it.' '' To a typical financial adviser, that might look like throwing money away -- a lot of it. For Orman, it was a gesture of pure liberation, the cleansing of an unhealthy relationship to money. 
 That same extravagant streak showed up in a relationship more recently. Eight years ago, when she first sensed that Travis was the right woman, Orman had her longtime driver meet Travis at the airport in a car filled with gardenias, Travis's favorite flower. Not long after Travis arrived home, the doorbell rang: a deliveryman with an armful of Casablanca lilies wanted to know where the rest of the flowers in his truck should go. It turned out that Orman had purchased the entire contents of a flower shop.
 But Orman also professes to have an aversion to frivolous gifts, at least when she's the recipient. ''I get mad when people give me presents,'' she told me. ''I don't want them, I don't need them.'' And flowers are the worst: ''They die.'' 
 Orman is nothing if not a contradictory personality -- someone who travels with her own healthful, organic food but who also rewards herself, after a day in which she has sold $1 million worth of her books or financial-planning kits on QVC, with a binge at Taco Bell. Karen Fonner, who works with Orman at QVC, recalls that at the end of a workday about eight years ago Orman told her that she craved a hot dog. Fonner took her to a hot-dog stand and watched -- everyone in the vicinity watched -- as Orman devoured six hot dogs.
 Appetite is something Orman understands, and that may be what her viewers intuitively appreciate as she mocks them on air for their own cravings. It's part of what makes her censure so palatable. She made herself famous by teaching people to resist the temptations of America's money culture -- but she's also a product of that culture and one of its more peculiar manifestations: a naturally skilled seller of stuff who sells freedom from consumerism and materialism. 
 ***
 People who have worked with Orman for years -- Julie Grau, for example, her editor at Spiegel & Grau -- often say that Orman has mellowed since meeting Kathy Travis, who goes by KT. A cheery, affectionate and efficient woman a year younger than Orman, Travis has a successful past in business herself, having spent most of her career building branding divisions in Asia for Ogilvy & Mather. When Travis shows up on the set of a show where Orman is appearing, she simply introduces herself as Orman's manager. It may not be a complete introduction, but it's accurate. Travis does everything for Orman, from handling press requests to seeking out new business arrangements to reapplying Orman's eyeliner and touching up her hair at photo shoots. 
 Orman first spoke openly in the press about Travis in a February 2007 interview for this magazine, but Orman insists that she was never closeted about her sexuality, an important point of pride for someone who writes about the importance of honesty. When she has written about past relationships in her books, she usually refers to a past love interest as ''that person'' or ''someone,'' but professionally, she has always been more direct. Her co-workers at Merrill, for instance, were aware that she was gay; she made sure her first publisher knew she was gay; and when representatives of the motivational writer Stephen Covey, a Mormon, proposed that she work with him, Orman says she told them: '' 'You wouldn't want to do a deal with me. Trust me. My lifestyle goes against what he practices every day.' They got it.''
 When in April 2006 Orman won her second Emmy award, for a program on PBS, she grabbed the statue and said: ''KT, this one's for you! I love you!''
 ''What do you think that means, everybody?'' Orman asked me, rhetorically, one afternoon at her home in the Plaza. Reclining in her champagne-hued home, Orman, with her golden hair, her tan, her chunky gold earrings and her bronze-hued jacket, looked, as she often does, as if she were dressed to evoke associations with wealth, not through luxury brands, but through sheer color scheme. She held her hand out as if waving a statue in the air. ''Is that somebody who's trying to hide that she's a lesbian on national TV?'' 
 Indirectly, sexual politics also played a part in Orman's collaboration with the F.D.I.C. Orman first got in touch with Sheila Bair at the F.D.I.C. not to talk about a public-service announcement but because Orman had fielded questions from a viewer about how trusts were insured by the F.D.I.C., and in the course of researching the topic, she concluded that the rules discriminated against people who are gay. She made her case to Bair, who told me that over the course of her conversations with Orman, she agreed that it was a freedom-of-choice issue and the rules needed to be changed, including a restriction on the trust insurance that required that you be a ''qualifying'' family member for protection. ''She asked, 'Why do you dictate who people are going to leave their money to, whether it's a gay partner or niece or close family friend?' '' Bair said. ''People should be able to make those decisions on their own.'' The F.D.I.C. simplified the rules. 
 ***
 By 8:20 one morning in mid-March, a mostly female crowd attending a women's leadership conference at Omaha's Qwest Center knew that Suze Orman was going to start speaking in a few minutes, and dozens of them started half-running across the conference room. They were beelining it over to the Ameritrade booth, where there was a poster with Orman's image on it. All they had to do, word had gotten around, was sign a simple pledge, and they would get a free copy of Orman's book ''Women and Money.'' By signing the (nonbinding) pledge, they would be committing to following the golden rules Orman has preached since she published her first book: Reduce debt; save for retirement; respect yourself by being honest about money. ''If you don't SAVE yourself,'' the language on the poster read, with Orman's visage smiling in a serious kind of way, ''who will?'' The poster directed them to a Web site with the same semiapocalyptic language: Saveyourself.com. 
 Onstage, dressed in a highly constructed black-and-white-striped jacket, Orman started delivering an unscripted talk. She wanted the women to know that ''a successful woman is a woman who loves who she is because of who she is and not what she has, and that's your definition of success, ladies!'' But she also wanted them to know that ''money is kind of just like air -- if you don't have air, you can't breathe. If you don't have money, I don't think you'll want to breathe -- you won't want to live.''
 She also wanted them to know -- information that she delivered with equal passion, if more practicality -- that the government was prepared to give qualified first-time home buyers a tax credit of up to $8,000, and that if you haven't owned a home for three years, you could be eligible. ''You have to know these things and not be afraid,'' she urged them. ''Please don't take on the fear of others and let that bring you down.''
 Orman speaks two or three times a month, usually for $80,000 a pop. On her first appearance on Q2, a smaller branch of QVC, she managed to outsell any other author who had appeared on the program. To date, her promotional materials claim, she's the No. 1 fund-raiser for PBS. (PBS said it could not confirm this particular statistic, but did verify that she's a very successful fund-raiser for the network.)
 ''No one is keeping you down,'' Orman said, wrapping it up, delivering her pet message of personal responsibility. ''You are not a victim of your circumstances -- if you can take that advice and understand and always do what's right and not what's easy -- may God bless each and every one of you, and may you watch 'The Suze Orman Show' on CNBC every Saturday night!'' 
 ***
 Since working with Orman, Travis has helped her secure a partnership with TD Ameritrade, for which Orman would encourage women in particular to invest their money in an Ameritrade account. Critics gave Orman a hard time about pushing women into one specific account, but she negotiated a deal with the company that she says she can stand by: in 2008, if clients invested $50 a month every month for a year in a ''Save Yourself'' account with Ameritrade, after the first 12 months the brokerage firm would give them $100. The incentive was Orman's idea, and Ameritrade says it wasn't an easy sell internally. ''At TD Ameritrade, we don't just give everybody money,'' Paula DeLaurentis, a managing director at the company, told me. ''It's a calculated risk.''
 This year Ameritrade increased the investment requirement to $100 a month, and DeLaurentis said the firm doesn't know what percentage of Save Yourself clients will continue to invest beyond the initial offer; but she said the proportion of women who sign up, wherever Orman speaks, is ''incredibly high,'' higher than any other offer they have.
 Travis also negotiated a deal for Orman with the developers of FICO, the credit-score formula, for whom Orman now produces an instructional kit that she sells on QVC. And Travis has taken over the management of Orman's brand. She occasionally lays it on a little thick. Explaining that Orman herself rarely seeks out new business opportunities, Travis says, ''Oh, no, Suze doesn't do that, because her interest is not to gain wealth or money -- her interest is in helping people.'' 
 Contrast that with what Orman said to The Chicago Tribune a few years back, when she was criticized for shilling a zero-percent-interest campaign for General Motors in a television ad that ran for a few weeks. Critics charged that she was compromising her objectivity (and that she hurt her credibility by implicitly endorsing the purchase of new cars, which she, like most financial planners, characterizes as a money-losing proposition). ''You think they don't know I was paid to do the G.M. commercial?'' Orman said of her viewers. ''I'm not in this for charity. This is a business, and anybody who thinks that it's not a business is an idiot.'' It's a more candid take on her motives than Travis's, but in its no-nonsense way, it's pitch-perfect Suze.
 Even as she stresses the legitimacy of her own financial self-interest, Orman takes seriously her unique position as the people's financial planner. Sheila Bair at the F.D.I.C. told me that Orman donated hours of her own time working on a new Web site that the F.D.I.C. was creating to deliver easy information about what funds are protected. Orman regularly talks off air with callers who need more help than she is able to give them on air. Orman pressed her publisher, Grau says, to give away her ''2009 Action Plan'' free of charge; they compromised on charging for it after the first two weeks. She sometimes sends financial aid to people who have reached out to her, and regularly donates her time at U.S. bases overseas to advise military families on their finances. 
 Karen Fonner, the vice president of strategic content for QVC, recalls watching Orman tell a heavily indebted woman who had just ordered her book not to buy it. ''She told her: 'I want you to cancel your order. Go to the library, my book is there,' '' Fonner remembers. ''That was the first time I'd ever seen someone do that.''
 Granted, every time she appears on QVC, Orman is probably selling to some people who have trouble with debt; selling kits on QVC about how to improve your credit rating is a little bit like being the in-house nutritionist selling salads at Burger King. Critics say Orman sells products like the $48 FICO kit on QVC to the people who can least afford them, or that she's too cautious in her investing advice, but none of it seems to worry Orman: all she has ever told people throughout her professional life is not to spend more than they can afford. As she said on ''Oprah'' in September, beseeching the audience, ''If you don't have the money to buy something, can you just not buy it?''
 Orman has strong opinions in general. She won't speak before many doctors' groups, because they get on her nerves (doctors always think they know better, she says). Until recently, she didn't like to speak at universities, because they generally don't charge students to attend her lectures, and she says that people don't value things they haven't paid for.
 She has been reluctant to work on school curricula on personal finance, because she says students can't learn empowerment from people who aren't empowered, and teachers, she says, are too underpaid ever to have any real self-worth. She told me: ''When you are somebody scared to death of your own life, how can you teach kids to be powerful? It's not something in a book -- it ain't going to happen that way.'' She once delivered pretty much the same message at an anniversary celebration of a private school -- she seems to recall calling the school a ''travesty'' -- and was all but escorted to the door when she was done. 
 Anyone looking for insight into the genesis of Orman's obsession with money, her deeply personal, all-consuming preoccupation with it, need look no farther than the first chapter of ''The Nine Steps to Financial Freedom.'' Just a few pages in, she tells the story of a fire that destroyed her father's chicken shack when she was about 13. Her father, who was there when the fire started, escaped without harm -- only to rush back in, his daughter watching in disbelief, after he realized that every cent the family had was in the cash register. Unable to open the register, he ''literally picked back up the scalding metal box and carried it outside,'' Orman writes. ''When he threw the register on the ground, the skin on his arms and chest came with it. He had escaped the fire safely once, untouched. Then he voluntarily risked his life and was severely injured. The money was that important. That was when I learned that money is obviously more important than life itself.'' 
 Orman goes on to talk about her quest to gain some perspective on that life lesson, and toward the end of the book, in a chapter called ''Understanding the Ebb and Flow of the Money Cycle,'' she returns to her father's story. Her father experienced a series of business reversals, she writes, but eventually he had two delis up and running successfully, and he stopped worrying: ''For the first time ever, there was enough money -- more than enough. My dad knew, too, that my mom would be taken care of after he was gone, and he was happy her brother would take over the family business.''
 Not long after that, she wrote, ''my father died -- in his eyes a lucky man.'' The point of the story: Sometimes the worst misfortune paves the way for a better opportunity. 
 ***
 Back in March, a few minutes before Orman was about to go live on ''Morning Joe,'' I mentioned to her that I had been struck by the story of her father's perseverance. Did his entrepreneurialism, I asked, inspire her? 
 ''My father killed himself,'' she said by way of an answer. ''On Father's Day.''
 I was startled by the apparent discrepancy with her more sanguine account of her father's death in ''The Nine Steps to Financial Freedom'' but let her continue. 
 That day, she went on, when she was 30, her father insisted on getting out of his wheelchair and walking and walking even though he had a serious heart condition and the doctors had warned him against it. ''He wouldn't open the presents. He knew what he was doing,'' she said. ''He died a defeated man. He didn't know who would take care of me and my mom.''
 A few weeks later, I asked Orman about the seeming contradiction in facts, and she passed it off blithely, even likably. ''Oh, who knows what I said in the book,'' she replied. She added that she probably gave the story a happier ending in print to please her mother. 
 On the morning she first told me that she believed her father killed himself, I thought I might somehow have been misremembering the story in the book -- and wasn't sure what to say. I remarked awkwardly that she had had an unusually intense life. Her response suggested that she managed to find an equally compelling, inspirational narrative from the sadder, presumably true, version of her father's history: ''Thank God,'' she said. ''It's made me the person I am.'' 
 And then she was off, whisked away by a producer who interrupted our conversation to deliver the words Orman loves to hear: ''Suze, you're on!''

HEADLINE: A New Personality For West 12th Street

BYLINE: By ALISON GREGOR

 BODY:
SCAFFOLDING is finally being stripped, as part of the metamorphosis of a slice of tree-lined West 12th Street near the Hudson River, where the recession has failed to halt construction of three high-design apartment buildings.
 The West Village block, between the river and Washington Street, was still dominated by former factories earlier this decade, but it has become solidly residential. Now, despite the severe real estate market downturn, property developers have forged ahead with construction of the three buildings, all meant to be architectural standouts. 
 The Related Companies, a national real estate development firm, is building a tower with 68 condominium apartments and seven town houses, designed by Robert A. M. Stern, at 400 West 12th Street. The complex is named Superior Ink, after the 1919 building it replaces.
 Across the cobblestone street, the architect-developer Cary Tamarkin of the Tamarkin Company has almost completed a building with five apartments, the smallest at 3,000 square feet, at 397 West 12th Street. 
 And next to that, at No. 385, is a copper-paneled tower of six flats, four town homes and two penthouses by the architecture-and-development firm FLAnk.
 ''For several years, the poor people that live on the block have had three buildings under construction at once,'' said Mr. Tamarkin, whose building will receive a temporary certificate of occupancy this month. ''But now, it's going to be a whole new block, with a high level of commitment, both artistically and monetarily.''
 In a city punctuated by motionless cranes, Mr. Tamarkin says he considers it an achievement just to have completed his 10-story building, which has a facade of Roman brick and multipaned industrial steel windows meant to call to mind a maritime warehouse.
 ''You're lucky if your project is not at a complete standstill; if you have a bank that's still funding; and if you have equity partners that are still putting money into projects,'' he said.
 While designers may be impressed, it remains to be seen how well the new apartments will sell. Though the West Village is one of the most established and pricey neighborhoods in Manhattan, sales have been sluggish since the recession began. 
 At that time, Superior Ink -- a 17-story brick-and-stone ziggurat with expansive arched windows, slightly evocative of a factory, sitting alongside seven traditional-looking town houses with bay windows -- was 95 percent sold at an average of more than $3,000 a square foot, according to published reports.
 But two months ago, the company reported that only 80 percent of the units were in contract.
 David Wine, the vice chairman of the Related Companies, would say only that Superior Ink is ''substantially sold, and we have continued to sell, as has been reported.''
 The tabloids reported in March that the designer Marc Jacobs had bought a town house at Superior Ink for about $2,888 a square foot.
 Tim Crowley, the managing director for development at FLAnk, said his company had sold 7 of the 12 apartments at 385 West 12th Street, but all the sales took place last summer. Apartments in the contemporary seven-story tower -- which in renderings appears to be a jumble of windows on various planes, vertical ribbons of translucent curtain wall and copper panels that will eventually turn bluish-green -- are going for an average price of about $2,000 a square foot, he said.
 Mr. Tamarkin, who began sales last summer, has sold only one of the five apartments, the four-story penthouse, to a partner. In April, he cut his prices by 15 percent.
 ''Related did fantastic with their building prior to the recession -- they achieved record-setting prices, so hats off,'' Mr. Tamarkin said. But he cautioned that the development company still has to close on the apartments. ''You have to see if people stick to their contract prices,'' he said.
 Mr. Wine said that Related expected closings to take place this summer.
 Mr. Tamarkin said he had faith in the neighborhood over the long haul, especially with a lack of future development opportunities.
 ''A huge swath of the West Village has been down-zoned and landmarked,'' he said, ''so great development sites are few and far between.''

 BEHIND THE NEWS One kind in particular, credit-default swaps, played a major role in the financial crisis, especially at the giant insurer American International Group, which was spared from collapse last fall by a $170 billion government bailout. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, above, wants to require that swaps and other derivatives be traded publicly on regulated exchanges and, like bank loans, be backed by capital reserves. 
 THE NEWSPresident Obama pressed Congress to enact new limits on credit card companies' practices, decrying unfair late fees, misleading marketing and ''anytime, any reason rate hikes.''
 BEHIND THE NEWS The president said he wanted a bill to sign by Memorial Day. The House has already passed one, and the Senate is expected to pass its version this week. The credit card industry wields great influence on Capitol Hill -- it got Congress to make it much harder for consumers to get relief from credit card debts in bankruptcy -- and it persuaded the Senate to reject a proposed 15 percent cap on credit card rates, angering consumer advocates. 
 THE NEWS The European Commission fined Intel a record 1.06 billion euros ($1.45 billion) for abusing its dominance in the computer chip market; in the United States, meanwhile, the Obama administration promised vigorous enforcement of antitrust laws.
 BEHIND THE NEWS A top European Union official said Intel ''used illegal anticompetitive practices'' to exclude Advanced Micro Devices and reduce consumer choice. Intel said it would appeal. Separately, the Justice Department said it would go after corporations that use their market dominance to hold down or squeeze out competitors. No new antitrust case was brought under President Bush.
 THE NEWSCraigslist, the largest classified advertising site on the Internet, said it would close down its unsupervised ''erotic services'' category and replace it with a new ''adult services'' section that its employees would monitor. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS Craigslist has come under intense pressure because of the ads. Violent crimes involving people who made contact through the ads have made headlines; prosecutors in several states have called the site a forum for prostitution. Some prosecutors said that, as with Craigslist's agreement last year to start charging for erotic ads (most of its classifieds are free), the new policy still does too little to prevent lawbreaking.
 THE NEWS The Obama administration's new chief of drug control policy, Gil Kerlikowske, said he wanted to scrap the idea of ''a war on drugs,'' saying that such bellicose terminology gets in the way of dealing effectively with the nation's drug problems. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS ''Regardless of how you try to explain to people it's a 'war on drugs' or a 'war on a product,' people see a war as a war on them,'' Mr. Kerlikowske told The Wall Street Journal. Drug use will be viewed more as a public health problem, he said, rather than just a policing problem, and federal agents will no longer raid medical-marijuana dispensaries in the 13 states where voters have approved them.

HEADLINE: Wie, Creamer and Lincicome Are in Position to Strike

BYLINE: By FRANK LITSKY

DATELINE: CLIFTON, N.J. 

 BODY:
One young American lost the lead Saturday in the L.P.G.A.'s Sybase Classic, but two others moved into strong position for the final 18 holes Sunday.
 The former leader was Brittany Lincicome, whose par 72 was the highest score among the seven players who led Saturday. The new contenders were Michelle Wie and Paula Creamer, who each shot a 68 on a cool, overcast day.
 After 54 holes, Suzann Pettersen of Norway and Ji Young Oh of South Korea, were tied for the lead after each shot a 69 for a three-day total of 204. Lincicome was third at 11-under-par 205, and Wie and Creamer were next at 207. 
 Wie is 19, Creamer 22 and Lincicome 23. Their success could be vital for the L.P.G.A. to salvage sponsorship and its status in American sports; it has lost five tournaments this year because of hard economic times.
 Wie and Creamer were confident entering the final round, especially because they were putting well. The golfers have been talking all week about the large and tricky greens at Upper Montclair Country Club.
 ''They are difficult,'' Creamer said. ''You really have to feel the grass out there. There are just so many different types out on these greens, and they are really kind of bumpy. It's kind of hit-and-hope on some parts.''
 On the 6,413-yard course, Creamer made six birdie putts, including one from 25 feet and one from 35 feet. She also had a double-bogey 6 on the 408-yard 12th hole when she hit a 5-iron shot into a water hazard.
 Creamer faced other difficulties, too. After the 11th hole, she had her caddie try to work out a knot under her shoulder blade. And she stretched out on her back after her drive on the 14th, a hole that she birdied. ''I was never comfortable the whole round,'' she said later. 
 Wie's six birdies were offset by bogeys on the 4th and 10th holes, each after a drive to the rough. She is seeking her first victory on the L.P.G.A. Tour.
 ''I always think about it,'' she said. ''That old Nationwide Tour commercial with the guy holding the little creamer thing, that's basically how I feel.''
 Pettersen also made six birdies, but erratic putting led to three bogeys. She shrugged, saying, ''As long as you give yourself chances, there are plenty of birdies out there.''
 She won five L.P.G.A. tournaments in 2007. Her failure to win last year, despite five top-three finishes, was deceiving, she said, because ''golf is a very marginal game.'' She added, ''Last year was a very good year for me.''
 Last year was an improvement for the 20-year-old Oh, winning the State Farm Classic. In 2007, her rookie year on the tour, she ranked 121st in driving distance (238.5 yards) and 88th in driving accuracy.
 She is not driving much farther now, but her approaches are models of consistency. Wedge shots set up her five birdies, including a 45-footer on the par-4 14th hole. Errant drives led to two bogeys.
 Oh said she was not concerned about her short drives.
 ''It doesn't matter,'' she said. ''I have my style of game.''
 Lincicome, always a long driver, made two bogeys after bad drives. She played the par-5 holes in one under par and said she should have birdied all four. Her putting also let her down.
 ''I'm hitting it good,'' Lincicome said. ''I'm hitting it close, 10-footers. Every once in a while, you should be able to make one, and it's not even touching the hole.''
 NOTES
 Lorena Ochoa, who won this tournament the three previous years, shot 72 for 214 and is 10 strokes behind the leaders. Helen Alfredsson, who followed an opening-round 62 with a 76, shot 72 and was tied for eighth place. KARRIE WEBB (72) was at 211. Natalie Gulbis (70) at 212, Juli Inkster (72) at 215 and Cristie Kerr (72) at 216.

HEADLINE: From a Theory To a Consensus On Emissions

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
As Congress weighs imposing a mandatory limit on climate-altering gases -- an outcome still far from certain -- it is likely to turn to a system that sets a government ceiling on total emissions and allows polluting industries to buy and sell permits to meet it.
 That approach, known as cap and trade, has been embraced by President Obama, Democratic leaders in Congress, mainstream environmental groups and a growing number of business interests, including energy-consuming industries like autos, steel and aluminum.
 But not long ago, many of today's supporters dismissed the idea of tradable emissions permits as an industry-inspired Republican scheme to avoid the real costs of cutting air pollution. The right answer, they said, was strict government regulation, state-of-the-art technology and a federal tax on every ton of harmful emissions. 
 How did cap and trade, hatched as an academic theory in obscure economic journals half a century ago, become the policy of choice in the debate over how to slow the heating of the planet? And how did it come to eclipse the idea of simply slapping a tax on energy consumption that befouls the public square or leaves the nation hostage to foreign oil producers?
 The answer is not to be found in the study of economics or environmental science, but in the realm where most policy debates are ultimately settled: politics. 
 Many members of Congress remember the painful political lesson of 1993, when President Bill Clinton proposed a tax on all forms of energy, a plan that went down to defeat and helped take the Democratic majority in Congress down with it a year later.
 Cap and trade, by contrast, is almost perfectly designed for the buying and selling of political support through the granting of valuable emissions permits to favor specific industries and even specific Congressional districts. That is precisely what is taking place now in the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has used such concessions to patch together a Democratic majority to pass a far-reaching bill to regulate carbon emissions through a cap-and-trade plan.
 The bill is poised to win committee approval this week, although with virtually no support from Republicans. If there was a single moment when cap and trade crossed the threshold from relatively untested economic concept to prevailing government policy, it came in May 1989 in the West Wing office of C. Boyden Gray, counsel to President George H. W. Bush.
 Mr. Gray had gathered a number of Mr. Bush's economic and environmental advisers to try to come up with a politically palatable plan to break a decade-long deadlock on the problem of acid rain, caused by sulfur dioxide emissions from coal-burning power plants in the Midwest.
 Mr. Gray and the other Bush advisers knew that the power companies -- and their allies in Congress -- would vigorously oppose a tax on sulfur emissions or stringent new regulations to control them. But the environmental costs of the problem were too big to ignore.
 One of Mr. Bush's outside advisers, Daniel J. Dudek, an economist with the Environmental Defense Fund, recalled that after years of unsuccessfully trying to sell the idea of setting a national limit on such emissions and letting companies trade permits or allowances to pollute, he finally came up with an analogy that broke the ice.
 ''I told Boyden: 'Imagine you just fired up the government printing presses and dumped an endless stream of money into the system. You'd have no way of controlling the money supply,' '' Mr. Dudek said. ''He understood totally and intuitively the importance of maintaining the cap, the key ingredient in our acid rain policy.''
 A month later, the Bush White House sent Congress a cap-and-trade plan for sulfur dioxide emissions that 18 months later became the linchpin of the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act, considered by many to be the most successful domestic environmental legislation ever enacted.
 But the proposal came under ferocious political assault during those months. The final bill reflected a series of compromises needed to keep the coalition supporting it together. But the sulfur dioxide cap, a roughly 50 percent reduction in emissions over the next decade, held. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that compliance with the program is close to 100 percent.
 ''Our proposal was at first ridiculed by environmentalists as little more than a license to pollute,'' said Representative Jim Cooper, a moderate Democrat from Tennessee and an early supporter of tradable permits. ''But today, few dispute it is one of the government's most successful regulatory programs ever.'' 
 Representative Henry A. Waxman, a California Democrat and chairman of the energy committee, and his allies are marshaling many of the same arguments for the cap-and-trade approach as they used two decades ago for acid rain. A cap-and-trade program brings support from industries that prefer it to a top-down federal regulatory scheme, they say. 
 Many regard it as the lowest-cost solution to a global pollution problem and a means of producing clean-energy breakthroughs. And it is a much easier political sell than a tax on fossil fuels. A measure of the political appeal of the final compromise on the 1990 cap-and-trade plan can be seen in the final votes: 401 to 25 in the House and 89 to 10 in the Senate. 
 But despite its success in the relatively contained problem of acid rain in the United States, cap and trade has proved less useful in other environmental problems and has gotten off to a troubled start in Europe.
 Even some early devotees of a system of tradable emissions permits believe that it will not work for carbon dioxide, by definition a planetary problem. A straightforward tax on each ton of carbon dioxide emitted by any source, they say, would provide more a more predictable price and a simpler system to police.
 ''If a philosopher king could design a system, he or should might pick a taxation system,'' said Robert Hahn, a White House economist under Mr. Bush who backed the acid rain program but is skeptical that it will work for the much more pervasive problem of carbon dioxide. 
 Former Vice President Al Gore has long supported a carbon tax. ''Tax what you burn, not what you earn,'' he says, as a way of both attacking global warming and remedying some of the inequities in the income tax. 
 But Mr. Gore also says a domestic cap-and-trade system would be easier to coordinate with other countries' carbon control programs.
 Cap and trade evolved from an academic debate that began in the early 1960s when Ronald H. Coase, then a professor at the University of Chicago Law School, wrote an influential paper, ''The Problem of Social Cost,'' that examined when government should intervene in cases where a private entity causes public harm. 
 In 1971, W. David Montgomery, a Harvard graduate student in economics, fleshed out the idea of emissions trading in his doctoral thesis and has spent much of the last three decades trying to figure out how the marketplace can deal with environmental problems that are caused by relatively few actors but have consequences felt globally.
 He supported the acid rain trading program, but said it was based on ''unique historical and economic circumstances'' that did not apply to the much more difficult problem of carbon dioxide emissions.
 Mr. Montgomery, now a vice president at Charles River Associates International, a consulting firm, said Mr. Waxman's proposal would ultimately act like a tax on carbon-producing industries, disguised by a complex cap-and-trade system.
 ''It is a steel fist of regulation covered by a velvet glove of emission trading,'' Mr. Montgomery said. ''Why not just impose a carbon tax?''

HEADLINE: Over Their Heads Till Loan Renegotiation Resets the Clock

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

DATELINE: White Plains 

 BODY:
 TWO years ago, Jorge and Marina Schiefer walked into the White Plains office of Countrywide Financial seeking a mortgage for a modest two-story home on Valley Road. Madeline Diaz, the loan officer, said she couldn't give them one under her company's rules because they were immigrants from Argentina and possessed Social Security numbers that were valid only for purposes of employment, not borrowing.
 Then last fall the Schiefers encountered Ms. Diaz once more, but this time she was working as a mortgage counselor for Westchester Residential Opportunities, a nonprofit group that tries to help homeowners in trouble. The Schiefers were indeed in financial trouble by then. They had gotten their loan from another bank, Ms. Diaz learned, a $500,000 adjustable rate mortgage, but they hadn't been able to make payments for three months because the interest rates had reset after two years to 9.25 percent from 7.95 percent and would balloon every six months thereafter to a cap of 13.95 percent. They were asking for Ms. Diaz's help in arranging an easier payment plan. 
 The story, with its coincidence, is illustrative of how easy it was in a heated housing market for people like the Schiefers to get no-deposit, no-income verification loans whose payments they knew they could not meet once the teaser rates evaporated. 
 Their assumption at the time, they said, was that they could refinance before the payments got too high. But at the time they agreed to such a loan, they, like many other home buyers, did not count on the housing market going into free fall.
 After Ms. Diaz had turned them down for a mortgage at Countrywide, the Schiefers had turned to Option One, a division of H&R Block that has since been taken over by American Home Mortgage Servicing. 
 Mr. Schiefer, 47, a freelance contractor, and Mrs. Schiefer, 41, who works as a baby sitter for three children, arrived in this country in 1999 and by 2006 were ready, they said, to buy a home. A white ranch-style house on Valley Road needed a lot of work, but they could afford it and Mr. Schiefer would do a lot of the necessary work himself.
 ''It means everything,'' Mr. Schiefer said, ''This is the American dream. The most important thing is to buy a house for your kids.''
 They were steered to Option One by a woman whose son played local soccer with their son Axel and worked for Community Resource Mortgage Company, a mortgage broker. The phone numbers given in Mrs. Schiefer's documents for the company and for the individual broker are no longer in service.
 Option One offered them a no-deposit, no-income verification mortgage with payments that began at $3,458 a month and after two years jumped to $3,944 a month. When the Schiefers questioned their ability to pay if the loan payments should reach $4,000 a month, the broker, they said, gave them what foreclosure counselors now say was commonly heard advice at the time, ''Don't worry, in a year you can try to refinance.'' 
 ''It was our first time,'' Mrs. Schiefer said in an interview. ''We didn't have enough experience. We were very excited, and sometimes when you're excited you make a lot of mistakes.''
 They paid a steep $25,000 in closing costs, but otherwise financed the entire cost of the house. They were barely able to make the first two years' payments.
 When the date for the reset on the loan approached, no one would lend them any money for refinancing, especially as home values started to plummet.
 ''We couldn't because we didn't have enough equity in the house,'' Mrs. Schiefer said. 
 In September they skipped their first payment and two more as well. 
 They turned to Westchester Residential Opportunities, which receives federal and county money to help mortgage holders renegotiate their loans. 
 In January, with Ms. Diaz's intervention, the Schiefers worked out a new 27-year payment plan that will cap their interest payments at 7 percent, with monthly payments after three years of $2,903.
 ''A thousand dollars less is a lot of money for us,'' Mrs. Schiefer said.

HEADLINE: Paying With Our Sins

BYLINE: By NICK GILLESPIE. 
Nick Gillespie is the editor in chief of Reason.com and Reason.tv.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
 THE Obama administration's drug czar made news last week by saying he wanted to end all loose talk about a ''war on drugs.'' ''We're not at war with people in this country,'' said the czar, Gil Kerlikowske, who favors forcing people into treatment programs rather than jail cells.
 Here's a better idea -- and one that will help the federal and state governments fill their coffers: Legalize drugs and then tax sales of them. And while we're at it, welcome all forms of gambling (rather than just the few currently and arbitrarily allowed) and let prostitution go legit too. All of these vices, involving billions of dollars and consenting adults, already take place. They just take place beyond the taxman's reach. 
 Legalizing the world's oldest profession probably wasn't what Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff, meant when he said that we should never allow a crisis to go to waste. But turning America into a Sin City on a Hill could help President Obama pay for his ambitious plans to overhaul health care and invest in green energy. More taxed vices would certainly lead to significant new revenue streams at every level. That's one of the reasons 52 percent of voters in a recent Zogby poll said they support legalizing, taxing and regulating the growth and sale of marijuana. Similar cases could be made for prostitution and all forms of gambling.
 In terms of economic stimulation and growth, legalization would end black markets that generate huge amounts of what economists call ''deadweight losses,'' or activity that doesn't contribute to increased productivity. Rather than spending precious time and resources avoiding the law (or, same thing, paying the law off), producers and consumers could more easily get on with business and the huge benefits of working and playing in plain sight.
 Consider prostitution. No reliable estimates exist on the number of prostitutes in the United States or aggregate demand for their services. However, Nevada, one of the two states that currently allows paid sex acts, is considering a tax of $5 for each transaction. State Senator Bob Coffin argues further that imposing state taxes on existing brothels could raise $2 million a year (at present, brothels are allowed only in rural counties, which get all the tax revenue), and legalizing prostitution in cities like Las Vegas could swell state coffers by $200 million annually. 
 A conservative extrapolation from Nevada to the rest of the country would easily mean billions of dollars annually in new tax revenues. Rhode Island, which has never explicitly banned prostitution, is on the verge of finally doing so -- but with the state facing a $661 million budget shortfall, perhaps fully legalizing the vice (and then taking a cut) would be the smarter play. 
 Every state except Hawaii and Utah already permits various types of gambling, from state lotteries to racetracks to casinos. In 2007, such activity generated more than $92 billion in receipts, much of which was earmarked for the elderly and education. Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, has introduced legislation to repeal the federal ban on online gambling; and a 2008 study by PriceWaterhouseCoopers estimates that legalizing cyberspace betting alone could yield as much as $5 billion a year in new tax revenues. Add to that expanded opportunities for less exotic forms of wagering at, say, the local watering hole and the tax figure would be vastly larger. 
 Based on estimates from the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, Americans spend at least $64 billion a year on illegal drugs. And according to a 2006 study by the former president of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, Jon Gettman, marijuana is already the top cash crop in a dozen states and among the top five crops in 39 states, with a total annual value of $36 billion. 
 A 2005 cost-benefit analysis of marijuana prohibition by Jeffrey Miron, a Harvard economist, calculated that ending marijuana prohibition would save $7.7 billion in direct state and federal law enforcement costs while generating more than $6 billion a year if it were taxed at the same rate as alcohol and tobacco. The drug czar's office says that a gram of pure cocaine costs between $100 and $150; a gram of heroin almost $400; and a bulk gram of marijuana between $15 and $20. Those transactions are now occurring off the books of business and government alike.
 As the history of alcohol prohibition underscores, there are also many non-economic reasons to favor legalization of vices: Prohibition rarely achieves its desired goals and instead increases violence (when was the last time a tobacco kingpin was killed in a deal gone wrong?) and destructive behavior (it's hard enough to get help if you're a substance abuser and that much harder if you're a criminal too). And by policing vice, law enforcement is too often distracted at best or corrupted at worst, as familiar headlines about cops pocketing bribes and seized drugs attest. There's a lot to be said for treating consenting adults like, well, adults.
 But there is an economic argument as well, one that Franklin Roosevelt understood when he promised to end Prohibition during the 1932 presidential campaign. ''Our tax burden would not be so heavy nor the forms that it takes so objectionable,'' thundered Roosevelt, ''if some reasonable proportion of the unaccountable millions now paid to those whose business had been reared upon this stupendous blunder could be made available for the expense of government.'' 
 Roosevelt could also have talked about how legitimate fortunes can be made out of goods and services associated with vice. Part of his family fortune came from the opium trade, after all, and he and other leaders during the Depression oversaw a generally orderly re-legalization of the nation's breweries and distilleries. 
 There's every reason to believe that today's drug lords could go legit as quickly and easily as, say, Ernest and Julio Gallo, the venerable winemakers who once sold their product to Al Capone. Indeed, here's a (I hope soon-to-be-legal) bet worth making: If marijuana is legalized, look for the scion of a marijuana plantation operation to be president within 50 years.
 Legalizing vice will not balance government deficits by itself -- that will largely depend on spending cuts, which seem beyond the reach of all politicians. But in a time when every penny counts and the economy needs stimulation, allowing prostitution, gambling and drugs could give us all a real lift.

HEADLINE: First Lady Delivers a Call to Graduates Who Inspired Her

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

DATELINE: MERCED, Calif. 

 BODY:
Michelle Obama on Saturday encouraged the first full graduating class at the University of California, Merced, to better their communities by using the same determination they had shown in bringing her to campus. 
 ''A few people may be wondering why did I choose the University of California, Merced, to deliver my first commencement speech as first lady,'' Mrs. Obama said. ''The answer is simple: you inspired me, you touched me. 
 ''There are few things that are more rewarding than to watch young people recognize that they have the power to make their dreams come true. And you did just that.'' 
 Mrs. Obama was drafted to speak here at the smallest, newest campus in the University of California system through a lobbying effort by students and their families. They peppered the White House with letters, videos and hundreds of Valentine's Day cards.
 ''And let me tell you, it worked,'' she said. ''Because I'm here.''
 The speech capped weeks of anticipation at the university for an event that left some students star-struck on a blazingly bright and hot afternoon.
 ''I haven't seen anyone of that magnitude in person,'' said Daniel Titcher, 22, a senior. ''Maybe a state senator or assemblyman or something, but nothing like this.'' 
 The appearance also delighted university officials, who had been working to raise enough money to pay for a more elaborate commencement, attended by more than 10,000 people. The $700,000 price tag for the event included enhanced security, like dozens of metal detectors. Lookouts were on rooftops around the school's quad, and Secret Service agents patrolled the campus, which sits surrounded by browning farmland outside Merced. 
 John Garamendi Jr., the vice chancellor for university relations, said he had been supportive but skeptical when student leaders told him they were trying to book Mrs. Obama. ''I said, 'Good luck,' '' Mr. Garamendi recalled, with a laugh. ''I said, 'I love you guys.' And I kept walking.'' 
 But sure enough, in late March, Mrs. Obama announced that she would make her sole college commencement appearance this season at the Merced campus. The decision brought a swell of pride to this university in the Central Valley of California. 
 ''Anybody who asks where my daughter's graduating from, I say, 'U.C. Merced,' and they go, 'Oh!' '' said Shelly Comer, a nurse whose elder daughter, Michelle, was receiving her degree in psychology. ''And then they start talking about Michelle Obama.'' 
 Mr. Garamendi echoed that. ''The eyes of the world are on us at this moment,'' he said. ''People are learning that there are positive things happening in California's Central Valley.''
 The first lady's visit brought a jolt of excitement to the region, which has been battered by drought, high unemployment and a high foreclosure rate. 
 Conor Mangan, 22, said he hoped that Mrs. Obama's appearance would help the local economy, if only for a day. ''I hope it pays off,'' said Mr. Mangan, who noted that he had backed Ron Paul in the presidential race. 
 Economic concerns were also on the mind of Irvin Junprung, 22, a biology major, who summed up the immediate plans for him and many of his fellow graduates. ''Find work,'' Mr. Junprung said. 
 Speaking at the commencement, Mrs. Obama stayed on inspirational terrain, echoing President Obama's themes of community service and perseverance in tough times. ''My husband knows a little something about the power of hope,'' she said. ''You are the hope of Merced. And this nation.''

HEADLINE: The Calm Before The Storm

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
-- Rahm Emanuel, perhaps the capital's best known barroom brawler, sounds like an apostle of peace and harmony these days. As President Obama's chief of staff, Mr. Emanuel has helped orchestrate a string of legislative victories and presided over a new era of cooperation between the White House and Congress. ''You haven't had big fights,'' he boasts. ''You've had big successes.''
 But he knows a fight is coming. It always comes. It may be over military spending or health care or financial regulation or the next Supreme Court justice. Or perhaps all of the above. In the end, a president and a Congress trying to achieve big things invariably see things differently and at some point Mr. Obama and lawmakers will come to a showdown over the direction they want to take the country. At that point, Mr. Obama's measure will be taken more fully. 
 The opening of the Obama presidency has been characterized by energy, action and Democratic solidarity but the truly big decisions are only now coming into view over the horizon. While deferential to Mr. Obama's enduring popularity, the Democratic Congress is showing increasing signs of restlessness over his national security policies and has signaled that it will not necessarily bow to his wishes on the form of health care or climate change legislation. His plan to reorient the defense budget away from big-dollar hardware to Special Operations strikes at the heart of many lawmakers' district jobs.
 Big fights tend to define presidencies, for good or ill, sometimes in unforeseen ways, whether it be Franklin D. Roosevelt's ultimately successful scraps with Congress over the New Deal or Richard M. Nixon's futile battles with lawmakers during the Watergate investigation. Ronald Reagan managed to negotiate a lot of his agenda through a Democratic House but never shied away from fights over the contras or other priorities. 
 Bill Clinton's titanic struggles with Congress set the course for his tenure. He demonstrated toughness with his one-vote economic plan victories in 1993 and waved his veto pen over health care, only to set up Democrats for defeat a year later and fail to overhaul the nation's medical system. Yet arguably the budget clash with Republicans that led to a government shutdown in 1995 salvaged his wounded presidency and guaranteed his re-election.
 George W. Bush avoided fights with Congress when Republicans were in charge for most of his first six years, taking as a matter of pride that he never vetoed a single bill during that time. But he relished the veto battles with Democrats once they took over after the 2006 election, ultimately staring them down in fights over Iraq war spending while losing fights over immigration. Eventually, he cut deals over his overseas AIDS program, warrantless surveillance and an economic stimulus package.
 Mr. Emanuel is adamant about the administration's success so far. ''We're about to have the most productive spring session in 20 years -- a credit card bill, anti-contract waste, the financial fraud bill, a major housing bill, F.D.I.C. finance bill, let alone the supplemental,'' Mr. Emanuel said, rattling off bills in an interview late last week. ''I challenge you to go back to anybody in a spring session and see something like that.''
 But he said he expected more contentious moments ahead. ''There will be issues surrounding the defense budget,'' he said. ''We made a massive change. It affects a lot of the Congress. That's a place where there will be a healthy debate. The details of health care will be a healthy debate. I'd say that's also going to be true about energy and financial reform.''
 Dan Meyer, who fought against the White House as a strategist for Newt Gingrich in the 1990s and for the White House as legislative affairs director for Mr. Bush, said the fights could be important. But having seen it from both sides, he said, too many of them are pointless exercises in ideological purity. ''I've long crossed the Rubicon,'' he said, ''and decided if you can get two-thirds or three-quarters of a loaf, grab it and pocket it.''
 So far, that has been Mr. Obama's approach. He left it to lawmakers to come up with the details of his $787 billion stimulus package as long as they followed his general direction. He backed away from a fight when Congress insisted on sending him a spending bill chock-full of the pet projects he campaigned against last year. When Congress left his proposal for a market-based cap on greenhouse gas emissions out of the budget, he made little protest because he got most everything else he wanted and calculated that climate change legislation could be achieved on another track.
 ''Congress has just followed his agenda and then he leaves to us the more detailed work,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, vice chairman of the Senate Democratic Caucus. ''Congress will bend over backward to accommodate because we realize we're in the same boat.'' He added: ''Inevitably there will be some confrontations, but because of the smooth relations, they won't be as sharp as they have been in the past.''
 Mr. Obama, of course, is the first president to arrive at the White House with recent Congressional service since Gerald R. Ford nearly 35 years ago and he brought with him a vice president, chief of staff, budget director, legislative director and several cabinet members with deep experience on Capitol Hill. Republicans accuse Mr. Obama of being too passive in letting Congressional leaders lead him around by the nose. His aides said they had simply worked out their differences in private.
 ''The confrontations are not public confrontations,'' said Patrick Griffin, who was Mr. Clinton's legislative director. ''I don't think he rolls over. I think that's a real mischaracterization. But he's much more disciplined, judicious and circumspect about how he does that stuff.''
 Mr. Emanuel could not help mocking the interest in the lack of public fighting so far. ''The New York Times is like a Jewish mother,'' he said. ''When it's acrimonious, you guys whine. When it's not acrimonious, you say how come it isn't?''
 Ultimately, it will come down to choices. If Congress passes a health care plan without the government-run insurance option that Mr. Obama favors, will he decide that is worth fighting for? If Mr. Obama nominates a Supreme Court justice who provokes an ideological struggle, will he dive into the traditionally polarizing confirmation wars?
 The appeal of a big fight won against the odds has to be weighed against the prospect of defeat. Once a president loses his first fight, as they all eventually do, his aura of invincibility begins to fade. 
 ''If you pass it by one vote, you can say it's a defining moment,'' said former Senator John B. Breaux, a Louisiana Democrat. ''But if you lose it by one vote, it's a defining moment in a negative way -- you weren't smart enough, you weren't powerful enough to get it through.''

HEADLINE: Legalization? Now for the Hard Question

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP. 
E-mail: Generationb@nytimes.com

 BODY:
ETHAN NADELMANN, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, has been advocating for legalization of marijuana for 20 years and says he's seen more progress in the last four months than in the previous two decades. ''It's starting to cascade,'' he said. ''Our model is the gay rights movement and their recent string of successes with gay marriage.''
 Mr. Nadelmann is a smart guy; he has a law degree and a doctorate from Harvard. He so impressed George Soros that the billionaire investor became the biggest financial backer for Mr. Nadelmann's advocacy. The Drug Policy Alliance has 45 staff members in seven offices nationwide working for legalization.
 In the 25 years since Nancy Reagan advocated just saying no, Mr. Nadelmann has seen a progression through four public stages out of the five he believes are needed to achieve legalization. 
 Stage 1. Bill Clinton: I smoked but I did not inhale.
 Stage 2. Al Gore: I smoked, it was wrong, I regret it, shame on me.
 Stage 3. Michael Bloomberg (asked if he'd tried pot): ''You bet I did and I enjoyed it.''
 Stage 4. Barack Obama: ''I inhaled frequently -- that was the point!''
 Stage 5. Public Figure to Come: Yes, I smoke the occasional joint.
 ''We need to drop the 'd' from 'smoked,' '' Mr. Nadelmann said, ''and move from past to present.''
 For many reasons, the advocates are feeling hopeful. The Obama administration has reversed a Bush policy of prosecuting medical marijuana use, which is now legal in 13 states; a recent Field poll in California showed for the first time that a majority of registered voters in that state favors legalizing and taxing pot; Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who has opposed legalization, now says he'd like to see a study done.
 National polls also show growing support -- an ABC/Washington Post poll last month found that 46 percent of Americans favored legalizing small amounts of pot for personal use; when the poll last asked the question, in 1997, 22 percent supported legalization.
 Every strategy for achieving legalization pins its hopes on the generation that first embraced pot en masse -- baby boomers -- gradually displacing older voters with no experience using the drug. The ABC poll found that 45 percent of boomers favored legalization, versus 30 percent of adults 65 and older.
 Mr. Nadelmann, a boomer himself at 52, says the biggest difference since the last legalization push, in the late 1970s, is the drug savvy of parents now versus then. ''In the '70s, that older generation of parents didn't know the difference between marijuana and heroin,'' Mr. Nadelmann said. ''This generation of boomer parents has a high familiarity with marijuana. An awful lot tried it, liked it; the vast number never went on to cocaine or heroin or even had a problem with marijuana.''
 That would be me. The 20-something me used marijuana in moderation, did not fall victim to reefer madness, did not go on to harder drugs, believed it to be a drug superior to alcohol in many respects, enjoyed it like the mayor, and inhaled like the president.
 The 20-something me preferred alcohol when socializing in large groups but pot for coupling.
 The 20-something me smoked a joint, then went to the Central Square Cinema in Cambridge, Mass., and howled at the 1936 anti-drug documentary ''Reefer Madness,'' which showed how pot-smoking could lead to hard drugs, murder, suicide, rape and the inevitable descent into insanity. (Afterward, the 20-something me had major munchies and hurried to Elsie's restaurant for the enormous roast beef sandwich special.)
 The 20-something me believes marijuana could be legalized, regulated and taxed like alcohol, providing much needed revenue.
 But the 50-something me, the parent of three boys and a girl, ages 14 to 21, is not so sure. The 50-something me -- who hasn't smoked in more than 20 years -- knows stories in our little suburb about classmates of my kids smoking pot in middle school, using heroin in college, going into rehab, relapsing, trying again. The 50-something me has seen the eyes of those boomer parents -- good people -- seen the weariness and fear, and thought, ''There but for the grace of God. ...''
 Recently I read David Sheff's best seller, ''Beautiful Boy,'' about his son Nic's addiction to methamphetamines, the boy's myriad rounds of rehab and repeated heartbreaking relapses. And while the problem drug in our house is legal (our boys went through numerous rounds of painful, nerve-racking alcohol-related groundings during high school), I was surprised by how much Mr. Sheff's book moved and frightened me as a parent.
 He reminded me of me. Now 52, Mr. Sheff stopped smoking pot more than 20 years ago, about the time his first was born. He's a work-at-home dad who's put his children at the center of his life. He and his wife have raised three kids who sound funny and terrific. He seems to have a sense of balance and moderation.
 And so I was stopped cold when I got to the part in the book where he talks about marijuana being addictive and leading to hard drugs.
 He sounded like ''Reefer Madness.''
 ''I know what you mean,'' he told me in a telephone conversation. ''Back then, I discounted all the warnings about pot being the gateway drug and rolled my eyes at the propaganda.''
 ''Of course, everyone who smokes pot doesn't go on to heroin or other drugs,'' he said. ''But everyone who does abuse heroin starts with pot. How do we navigate that?'' His son Nic started smoking at 12, though the father didn't know it. Studies have shown the earlier kids start, the more likely they are to develop serious drug problems, so Mr. Sheff believes anything that can be done to delay using improves the odds.
 He has mixed feelings about legalization. He believes drug abuse should be treated as a health problem, not a criminal one. ''But I worry we're sending a message I don't agree with, that marijuana is harmless.'' He said he hopes his two younger children, Jasper, 15, and Daisy, 12, never smoke.
 Mr. Nadelmann, the advocate, says making pot illegal hasn't worked any better than Prohibition. He says, while it's easier for teenagers to get their hands on alcohol than pot, it's easier for them to buy pot than alcohol. My sons agreed with this. As one said, ''Dad, there are kids at the high school whose job is to sell you pot.''
 As to concern voiced by law enforcement officials that today's pot is far stronger than the drug smoked in the 1970s, Mr. Nadelmann maintains that if marijuana were legalized, the potency could be regulated the way it's done for alcohol.
 Mr. Nadelmann has done thousands of interviews, and he knows drug policy so well it's hard to keep up with him. Only twice during our conversation did he hesitate. I asked if he smokes.
 ''Off the record?'' he said.
 I said I'd like his on-the-record answer.
 ''I smoke marijuana occasionally,'' he said, in the privacy of his home. ''But I don't travel with it. I can't afford to put myself at risk.''
 I asked if his daughter, now 20, had seen him smoke when she was growing up. ''She grew up seeing adults she knew and respected smoke the occasional joint, and saw they didn't change,'' he said.
 So much is changing: our first African-American president; our worst economic collapse in 80 years; five states legalizing gay marriage. Is legalizing marijuana next? It may make sense. It may happen. But with so many boomers, including our president, now parents raising children, I'm not so sure.

HEADLINE: The Tip That Didn't Pan Out

BYLINE: By CLARK HOYT. 
The public editor can be reached by e-mail: public@nytimes.com

 BODY:
ON March 17, a Republican lawyer, quoting a confidential source for a Times reporter, testified to Congress that the newspaper killed a story last fall because it would have been ''a game-changer'' in the presidential election.
 The charge, amplified by Bill O'Reilly on Fox News in April and reverberating around the conservative blogosphere, is about the most damning allegation that can be made against a news organization. If true, it would mean that Times editors, whose job is to report the facts without fear or favor, were so lacking in integrity that they withheld an important story in order to influence the election.
 I have spent several weeks looking into this issue -- interviewing and e-mailing those involved, reading transcripts, looking at campaign finance records and conferring with legal experts. In a nutshell, I think the charge is nonsense. 
 The story involved allegations that Barack Obama's campaign, in league with Acorn, a left-leaning community activist group, was guilty of technical violations of campaign finance law. Evidence supplied by the source could not be verified. Even if the story had panned out, it is hard to see how any editor could have regarded it as momentous enough to change an election in which the Republicans were saddled with an unpopular war and an economic meltdown. 
 But the controversy offers a look at an aspect of journalism the public seldom sees: the delicate relationship between a reporter and a source who approach a story with different standards and motivations. And it shows how partisans can twist normal editorial processes until they appear sinister.
 The situation came into the open at the hearing in March before a House judiciary subcommittee. Heather Heidelbaugh, a Pittsburgh lawyer, testified that a former Acorn employee, Anita Moncrief, had fed information to Stephanie Strom of The Times for several articles on troubles within the group. Heidelbaugh, a member of the Republican National Lawyers Association, had sued Acorn in Pennsylvania, alleging voter registration fraud. Moncrief was her witness.
 The articles stopped, Heidelbaugh testified, after Moncrief told Strom that the Obama campaign had given Acorn a list of so-called maxed-out donors -- people who had given the legal maximum to the candidate -- so that Acorn could solicit them for get-out-the-vote contributions. 
 ''Ms. Strom reported to Ms. Moncrief that her editors at The New York Times wanted her to kill the story because, and I quote, 'it was a game-changer,' '' Heidelbaugh said.
 Strom's version is a good deal different and is supported by her editor and e-mail between her and Moncrief. Moncrief answered some of my questions by e-mail but then went silent and never responded to requests for an interview. 
 On Sept. 7, Moncrief wrote to Strom that she had donor lists from the campaigns of Obama and Hillary Clinton and that there had been ''constant contact'' between the campaigns and Project Vote, an Acorn affiliate whose tax-exempt status forbids it to engage in partisan politics. Moncrief said she had withheld that information earlier but was disclosing it now that the conservative columnist Michelle Malkin was ''all over it.''
 ''I am sorry,'' she wrote, ''but I believe in Obama and did not want to help the Republicans.''
 Strom wrote back: ''Am also onto the Obama connection, sadly. Would love the donor lists. As for helping the Repubs, they're already onto this like white on rice. SIGH!'' Was Strom betraying her own political leanings, even as she asked for the lists that could make the story? Or was she expressing sympathy for Moncrief, who was unhappy about possibly hurting her own candidate? Strom said she does not know what was on her mind eight months ago, but that she is careful to keep her political views private. ''I tended to be sympathetic to her throughout,'' she said. She was also trying to get information.
 After some delay, Strom said, Moncrief sent her a spreadsheet purporting to be the Obama donor list, but there was no on-the-record source or other way to verify that the list came from the Obama campaign. Strom said Moncrief finally agreed to go on the record, though there was a credibility problem: Moncrief had been fired by Acorn for using an official credit card for personal expenses.
 But before they were to meet, Strom said, another source gave her an internal report detailing concerns about impermissible political activity by Acorn and its tax-exempt affiliates. The resulting article was published on Oct. 22.
 Suzanne Daley, the national editor, said she then called a halt to Strom's pursuit of the Obama angle. ''We had worked on that story for a while and had come up empty-handed,'' Daley said. ''You have to cut bait after a while.'' She said she never thought of the story as a game-changer and never used that term with Strom.
 On Fox, O'Reilly played part of a voice-mail message from Strom to Moncrief canceling their appointment but did not tell his viewers that he had deleted the reason: the article running the next day spelling out Acorn's partisanship problems. Nowhere in the message were the words ''kill the story'' or ''game-changer'' used. David Tabacoff, O'Reilly's senior executive producer, said the tape ''was simply edited for time.'' 
 O'Reilly also said that Moncrief made her allegations about The Times under oath, to Congress. But Moncrief did not testify at the hearing. Tabacoff said she had testified in Pennsylvania, and Heidelbaugh was simply relaying her accusations. But Moncrief never made any such accusations under oath in Pennsylvania. I have the transcript.
 Strom said she does not believe she ever used the term ''game-changer'' with Moncrief because, like Daley, she did not think the story would have been that. (I agree: Obama's maxed-out donors are public record, making the issue of who provided the list to Acorn of questionable news importance.) Moncrief, in e-mail to me, said Strom did, but in more benign fashion. She said Strom told her ''it was their policy not to print a game-changer for either side that close to the election.''
 Representative James Sensenbrenner, the Wisconsin Republican who called Heidelbaugh to testify, told me that he thinks the Obama campaign and Acorn clearly broke the law and that if The Times had published the story, it could have angered enough people over voter fraud to change the election. But Lawrence Norton, who was general counsel to the Federal Election Commission from 2001 to 2007, said he doubted the commission would even have opened an investigation because the evidence was so speculative and coordination between a campaign and a support group is difficult to prove. ''It's hard for me to see how this is a game-changer,'' he told me.
 I have to vote with Norton, and I think The Times handled the story as any responsible news organization would.

HEADLINE: Israel's Fears, Amalek's Arsenal

BYLINE: By JEFFREY GOLDBERG. 
Jeffrey Goldberg, a national correspondent for The Atlantic, is the author of ''Prisoners: A Story of Friendship and Terror.''

 BODY:
WHEN the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, visits the White House on Monday for his first stage-setting visit, he will carry with him an agenda that clashes insistently with that of President Obama. Mr. Obama wants Mr. Netanyahu to endorse the creation of a Palestinian state. Mr. Netanyahu wants something else entirely: the president's agreement that Iran must be prevented from acquiring nuclear weapons. 
 Mr. Netanyahu, in his first term as prime minister in the late 1990s, earned a reputation for conspicuous insincerity. It is therefore possible to interpret his fixation on Iran -- he told me in a recent conversation that it is ruled by a ''messianic apocalyptic cult'' -- as a way of avoiding the mare's nest of problems associated with the Middle East peace process, especially the escalating pressure from the Obama administration to curb Jewish settlement on the West Bank. 
 This reading of Mr. Netanyahu holds that he is, at bottom, a cynic (or, if you agree with him, a pragmatist), who will bluff vigorously but bend whenever he thinks it expedient or unavoidable. In his first term, he betrayed the principles of the Greater Israel movement by relinquishing part of Judaism's second-holiest city, Hebron, to the control of Yasir Arafat. His pragmatism evinces itself, as well, in his apparent belief that the relationship between Israel and Washington is sacrosanct. In other words, Mr. Netanyahu, despite his rhetoric, would never launch a strike on Iran without the permission of Mr. Obama -- permission that in no way appears forthcoming.
 But this is to misread both the prime minister and this moment in Jewish history. It is true that Mr. Netanyahu would prefer to avoid hard decisions concerning the Palestinian issue, for reasons both political (he is not, let us say, sympathetic to the cause of Palestinian self-determination) and strategic (he believes the Palestinians, divided and dysfunctional, their extremists firmly in the Iranian camp, are unready for compromise). 
 Nevertheless, the prime minister's preoccupation with the Iranian nuclear program seems sincere and deeply felt. I recently asked one of his advisers to gauge for me the depth of Mr. Netanyahu's anxiety about Iran. His answer: ''Think Amalek.'' 
 ''Amalek,'' in essence, is Hebrew for ''existential threat.'' Tradition holds that the Amalekites are the undying enemy of the Jews. They appear in Deuteronomy, attacking the rear columns of the Israelites on their escape from Egypt. The rabbis teach that successive generations of Jews have been forced to confront the Amalekites: Nebuchadnezzar, the Crusaders, Torquemada, Hitler and Stalin are all manifestations of Amalek's malevolent spirit. 
 If Iran's nuclear program is, metaphorically, Amalek's arsenal, then an Israeli prime minister is bound by Jewish history to seek its destruction, regardless of what his allies think. In our recent conversation, Mr. Netanyahu avoided metaphysics and biblical exegesis, but said that Iran's desire for nuclear weapons represented a ''hinge of history.'' 
 ''Iran has threatened to annihilate a state,'' he said. ''In historical terms, this is an astounding thing. It's a monumental outrage that goes effectively unchallenged in the court of public opinion. Sure, there are perfunctory condemnations, but there's no j'accuse -- there's no shock.'' He argued that one lesson of history is that ''bad things tend to get worse if they're not challenged early.'' He went on, ''Iranian leaders talk about Israel's destruction or disappearance while simultaneously creating weapons to ensure its disappearance.''
 Mr. Netanyahu doesn't believe that Iran would necessarily launch a nuclear-tipped missile at Tel Aviv. He argues instead that Iran could bring about the eventual end of Israel simply by possessing such weaponry. ''Iran's militant proxies would be able to fire rockets and engage in other terror activities while enjoying a nuclear umbrella,'' he said. This could lead to the depopulation of the Negev and the Galilee, both of which have already endured sustained rocket attacks by Hamas and Hezbollah. 
 More broadly, he said, a nuclear Iran ''would embolden Islamic militants far and wide, on many continents, who would believe that this is a providential sign, that this fanaticism is on the ultimate road to triumph.'' 
 To understand why Mr. Netanyahu sees Iran as a new Amalek, it is essential to understand two aspects of his intellectual and emotional development: The scholarship of his father, and the martyrdom of his older brother.
 His father, Benzion Netanyahu, 99, is a pre-eminent historian of Spanish Jewry. ''The Origins of the Inquisition in 15th-Century Spain,'' his most notable book, toppled previously held understandings of the Inquisition's birth. 
 Over more than 1,300 pages, Benzion Netanyahu argued that Spanish hatred of Jews was not merely theologically motivated but based in race hatred (the Spanish pursued the principle of limpieza de sangre, or the purity of blood) that reached back to the ancient world. 
 The elder Netanyahu also argued that efforts by the Jews of Spain to accommodate their adversaries were futile, in part because the charges against them were devoid of logic or fact, and, perhaps most important, because the written or spoken expression of Jew hatred (his preferred term for anti-Semitism) inevitably led to physical persecution. ''What emerges from our survey,'' he wrote, ''is that the Spanish Inquisition was by no means the result of a fortuitous concourse of circumstances and events. It was the product of a movement that called for its creation and labored for decades to bring it about.''
 A close reading of Benzion Netanyahu suggests a belief that anti-Semitism is a sui generis hatred, one that is shape-shifting, impervious to logic and eternal. The only rational response to such sentiment, in the Netanyahu view, is militant Jewish self-defense. 
 Benjamin Netanyahu and his two brothers were raised in a home darkened by the history of the Inquisition, and they were taught Benzion's understanding of the consequences of Jewish weakness. In his 1993 book, ''A Place Among the Nations,'' Benjamin Netanyahu wrote about what he saw as one of the miracles of the Zionist revolution: ''The entire world is witnessing the historical transformation of the Jewish people from a condition of powerlessness to power, from a condition of being unable to meet the contingencies of a violent world to one in which the Jewish people is strong enough to pilot its own destiny.'' 
 If his father provided Mr. Netanyahu with his historical framework, his brother Yonatan bequeathed on him the model of a Jew who devoted his spirit to the cause of his people's survival. Yonatan, who was killed while leading the 1976 raid on the Entebbe airport in Uganda to free Israeli captives of Arab and German hijackers, is perhaps the most venerated figure in the post-Warsaw Ghetto Jewish martyrology, mainly because Entebbe still symbolizes the purest expression of the modern Jewish rejection of passivity. 
 Friends and advisers say Benjamin Netanyahu took three lessons from his brother's death: The first is that those who threaten Jews, and have the means to carry out their threats, should be neutralized pre-emptively. The second is that no one will defend the Jews except the Jews themselves. The third is that destiny has chosen the Netanyahus to expose and battle anti-Semitism -- before it reaches the point of genocide.
 In his eulogy for Yonatan Netanyahu, Shimon Peres, then Israel's defense minister, said: ''There are times when the fate of an entire people rests on a handful of fighters and volunteers. They must secure the uprightness of our world in one short hour. In such moments, they have no one to ask, no one to turn to. The commanders on the spot determine the fate of the battle.''
 BENJAMIN Netanyahu faces the daunting task of maintaining Israel's relationship with the United States, while at the same time forestalling Iran's nuclear program. If Iran gains nuclear capacity, Israel will have judged him a failure as prime minister; if he does serious damage to his country's standing in Washington, he will have failed as well. 
 Mr. Netanyahu may be able to convince Mr. Obama that Iran poses an Amalek-sized threat to Israel, but he will have a much more difficult time convincing him that Iran poses an existential threat to America. It is certainly true that a nuclear Iran is not in the best interests of the United States. It would mean, among other things, the probable beginning of a nuclear arms race in the world's most volatile region, and it would mean that the 30-year-struggle between America and Iran for domination of the Persian Gulf will be over, with Persia the victor. But the short-term costs, in particular, for an American strike -- or an American-approved Israeli strike -- could be appallingly high. 
 As the crisis worsens, Mr. Obama will find his options few, and those that exist will require him to bring to bear all his talents of persuasion. In his effort to engage Iran, he will need to promise a complete end to its international isolation in exchange for a halt to its nuclear program. But at the same time, he must be ready to threaten Iran with total estrangement from the West -- the limiting of its gas imports, the choking-off of its banking system -- if it continues its nuclear program. 
 To do this, he must convince Europe, China and Russia that a nuclear Iran will be catastrophic for Middle East stability as well as for their own economies. If he's unwilling to take military action against Iran, President Obama might soon enough be forced to design a containment strategy meant to scare a nuclear Iran into something resembling quiescence. 
 Talk of containing Iran after it acquires a nuclear capacity, however, does not make the Israelis (or Iran's Arab adversaries, for that matter) happy and, in fact, might push them closer to executing a military strike. The president, who has shown he understands the special dread Israelis feel about their precarious existence, surely knows this. 
 Last year, during his campaign, he told me, ''I know that that there are those who would argue that in some ways America has become a safe refuge for the Jewish people, but if you've gone through the Holocaust, then that does not offer the same sense of confidence and security as the idea that the Jewish people can take care of themselves no matter what happens.'' 
 Mr. Netanyahu says he supports Mr. Obama's plan to engage the Iranians. He also supports the tightening of sanctions on the regime, if engagement doesn't work. But there should be little doubt that, by the end of this year, if no progress is made, Mr. Netanyahu will seriously consider attacking Iran. His military advisers tell me they believe an attack, even an attack conducted without American help or permission, would have a reasonably high chance of setting back the Iranian program for two to five years. 
 Around the world, this would be an extraordinarily unpopular step, but Mr. Netanyahu knows he would have much of the Israeli public behind him. Even the man who delivered the eulogy at his brother's funeral, the far more dovish Shimon Peres, has assimilated the lessons Benzion taught his sons. 
 When I visited recently with Mr. Peres, who is now Israel's president, I asked him if there is a chance that his country has over-learned the lessons of Jewish history. He answered, ''If we have to make a mistake of overreaction or underreaction, I think I prefer the overreaction.''

HEADLINE: After The Great Recession

 BODY:
In David Leonhardt's interview with President Obama (May 3), the president provided a glimpse of what we should want from a reformed health care system. Implicitly, he held out the vision of individuals who, because they have insurance, feel encouraged to visit their doctors early in an episode of illness. Over time, doctor and patient build trusting relationships focused on the patient's health as the only legitimate endpoint. And for their part, the doctors have both the information, available electronically, that they need to provide the most appropriate care and financial incentives that encourage them to do so.
 This image reminds me of a study I did at the Harvard Community Health Plan in the 1980s. We heard repeatedly from physicians how much they appreciated the staff-model H.M.O. arrangements that allowed them to focus on doing their best for their patients. They felt relieved not to need to worry about, on the one hand, whether a patient could afford the appropriate treatment and, on the other, how their clinical decisions would affect their own financial well-being. 
 STEPHEN M. DAVIDSON Boston University School of Management Boston
 President Obama makes a strong case for education as the ticket to getting good jobs and securing the economic future of the nation's middle class. Here's another good reason: More education translates to better health. A new report from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Commission to Build a Healthier America demonstrates that people with more education are healthier. For example, compared with college graduates, people who don't finish high school are more than three times as likely in some states to have less than very good health. Their rates of diabetes and heart disease are five times higher than those of people whose health is very good or excellent.
 These health differences aren't just a matter of extremes. What we see is a sliding scale of increasingly better health linked to increasing levels of education. Improving education can improve America's health, which in turn can help our nation lower health care costs, which in turn can help our economy. Education, health and the economy are all linked. Policy makers should develop a unified approach to addressing these issues.
 JAMES S. MARKS Senior Vice President The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Princeton, N.J.
 President Obama's responses to David Leonhardt's questions about health care are almost solely about the individual physician treating the individual patient -- the already ill -- and payment for one-on-one care of the ill. Yet most of the advances in public health -- public health being the health of as many individuals as possible, minimizing the need and demand for critical care -- have come about as a result of government involvement in what may be called indirect, nonclinical endeavors like healthful air, healthful water, healthful food, safe buildings, healthful waste disposal, large-scale epidemiology and basic scientific research. The extreme diversion of public funds to individual care shifts the public focus from public health to the financial benefit of the individual clinical practitioner, but it would be valuable for the government to consider ''health care'' in the more general sense of public-health programs.
 DAVID C. GARRON Chicago
 In the article transcribing his conversation with President Obama, David Leonhardt wisely included nine footnotes, some of them quite extensive. Footnotes! In a presidential interview! I seem to recall a recent president who may never in his life have even read a footnote. Now we have one whose off-the-top-of-his-head comments require nine of them, so that we can fully understand his meaning. Breathes there a citizen with soul so dead that he can't appreciate this improvement?

HEADLINE: At Fellowships, Newspapers No Longer Rule

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
For decades, successful newspaper reporters and editors have looked forward to university fellowships as a chance to take a mid-career sabbatical and recharge their batteries. But the crop of fellows set to enter this year's most prestigious programs, whose names are just now being announced, shows how much that pattern is changing.
 These days, struggling papers are less likely to allow their journalists the time off, for one thing. The pool they employ is drastically smaller, and those who have lasted to midcareer tend to be less worried about recharging their batteries than keeping their jobs. 
 So even though newspaper employees once dominated the top journalism fellowships, their share had been slipping for a few years, and in selections made over the last few weeks for the next academic year, it has plummeted. Four of the best-known programs -- at Harvard, M.I.T., Stanford and the University of Michigan -- chose 29 employees of American newspapers for fellowships in the year that is now winding down, and just 11 for next year. There have also been declines in the number of people from magazines and wire services, but not as pronounced.
 At the same time, applications to those four programs, for positions that are open to American journalists, jumped 62 percent this year, to about 600. The pool was swelled by legions of journalists who no longer have steady work, and by people from the growing nontraditional media. The slots that used to go to newspaper people are going, instead, to freelancers, including many who do some work for papers, and to people in online and broadcast media. Some programs are also giving more positions to journalists from overseas.
 ''When the economy goes down, our applications go up somewhat, but this year the pool almost doubled,'' said James R. Bettinger, director of the John S. Knight Fellowships at Stanford. ''The proportion of applicants from daily newspapers this year was the lowest it's ever been. At the same time, 61 of 166 applicants had the word 'freelance' somewhere in their job description.''
 Fellowships pay stipends, while allowing the recipients to take university classes and, depending on the program, pursue a particular, in-depth research project or travel. Applicants who were on staff at a news organization traditionally received permission to take a leave of absence, with the promise of resuming their jobs when they returned. And while they were gone, their employers maintained their health insurance coverage and sometimes even continued to pay part of their salaries.
 ''Now we get a lot of letters from applicants saying, 'My editors say they're no longer going to support long-term fellowships, they can't pay health insurance, they can't keep my job for me, and if I'm selected I'm going to have to resign and then apply to get my job back,' '' said Bob Giles, curator of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard, which has a fellowship program.
 To keep up with that reality, programs have increased their stipends -- at some top programs, $60,000 or more for nine months, plus living expenses in some cases -- and all now offer health insurance.
 But program directors say the primary factor keeping newspaper journalists out of the program is not their immediate finances, but fear for the future.
 ''People are afraid that if they leave, at a time when newspapers are laying people off, their jobs won't be waiting when they come back -- and they're right to think that,'' said Charles R. Eisendrath, director of the Knight-Wallace Fellows at Michigan. ''The fall-off in newspaper applicants is disproportionately from the big corporations, the big and medium-sized papers, where most of the layoffs have been. The smaller ones are still enthusiastic contributors to fellowship programs.''
 Philip Hilts, director of the Knight Science Journalism Fellowships at M.I.T., said, ''This year, 3 out of our 11 fellows left their jobs while they were here -- they took a buyout or they were laid off.''
 At The New York Times, the policy toward fellowships has not changed, and newsroom layoffs have been minimal compared with those at most newspapers. Yet no one from The Times applied this year for a Nieman fellowship, ''which I can't remember ever happening before,'' Mr. Giles said. (The Nieman program has not announced its 2009-10 fellows yet, but Mr. Giles gave a breakdown of the backgrounds of those who have been tentatively selected.)
 Directors say that what the journalists and the programs want from each other has shifted in the last few years, reflecting the changing media landscape.
 ''People are more likely to use fellowships to recalibrate and redirect their careers, learn a specialty or new media, rather than focus on the direction they were already headed,'' Mr. Eisendrath said. Fellowships are more likely than they were a few years ago to focus on Internet, audio, video and business skills.
 Some programs have also decided to make a conscious shift toward new forms of journalism.
 ''There is a much broader media landscape out there, and we are trying to recognize that and leverage that,'' said Mr. Bettinger, of Stanford. ''One of the things that's clear to us is that many potentially powerful innovations will come from outside traditional journalism. This year, we chose two media consultants, people you wouldn't traditionally consider journalists, where last year I don't know that we would even have looked at them.''

HEADLINE: Voters to Face 6 Measures On Finances In California

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
When California voters go to the polls on Tuesday to decide the fate of six budget-related ballot measures, one could argue that they have only themselves to blame. 
 After all, most of the measures -- Propositions 1A through 1F -- alter laws or rules they previously passed by initiative. Proposition 1E, for example, temporarily redirects money guaranteed for mental health services by Proposition 63, which voters approved in 2004. Proposition 1D does the same for money due to early childhood programs and guaranteed by Proposition 10, passed in 1998. And Proposition 1C seeks to modernize the lottery, which was created by voters in 1984, and allow the state to borrow from future profits. 
 ''No one piece is incredibly complicated,'' said Mac Taylor, the head of the Legislative Analyst's Office in Sacramento. ''But with some I don't know how a voter on their own would make sense of them.'' 
 All six measures were put on the ballot after a much-delayed budget deal passed in February, closing a $42 billion gap. But pollsters say the complexity of the issues and a profound sense of voter discontent may have a deadening effect on turnout, something that proponents of the measures fear. 
 ''I do hope that voters understand how serious this is,'' the California Assembly speaker, Karen Bass, a Los Angeles Democrat, said in an interview last week. ''I do think if we fail and if we have to impose more cuts, the outrage will far surpass the anger people feel in having to participate in fixing the budget.''
 The voting will take place at a time when Californians are deeply unhappy with the performance of their elected leaders. Polls have shown five of the six propositions trailing. Tellingly, the only measure leading -- Proposition 1F -- is one that seeks to place curbs on legislators' salaries. 
 Perhaps the biggest issue in front of voters, policy experts say, is Proposition 1A, which would increase the amount of money funneled into the state's rainy-day fund, restrict spending from it and extend several temporary taxes. Proposition 1B, which is related, would require $9.3 billion to be paid to education to make up for shortfalls in spending levels set, as it happens, by Proposition 98, which voters approved in 1988.
 Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, has been campaigning for the measures, saying they would ''stop that madness'' of budget booms and busts. 
 But opponents say the first measure is just a reheated version of the spending cap that Mr. Schwarzenegger unsuccessfully tried to have passed in a 2005 special election. 
 ''This is just his next attempt to put a fiscal straitjacket on the investments we need to build a better California,'' said Mike Roth, a spokesman for the union-backed No on 1A coalition.
 The measure is also opposed by antitax groups already upset at the passage of an additional 1 percent sales tax, which would be extended by two years under Proposition 1A, and at increased vehicle and income taxes. All were approved in the February budget deal. 
 Supporters of measures have cast passage as an important step in solving the state's budget troubles. But the ballot questions are not being sold as silver bullets. Last week, in fact, Mr. Schwarzenegger announced that the state, battered by recession, would face a budget gap of $15.4 billion for the coming year even if the measures passed. The damage, though, would be even worse if they failed. 
 Such arguments do not seem to be resonating with voters. 
 Mark Baldassare, the president and chief executive of the Public Policy Institute of California, said Californians had lost confidence in state leaders on fiscal issues. ''Now the governor and Legislature are coming to say, 'This is the best we can to do,' '' Mr. Baldassare said. ''And thus far, that has not been a message that has swayed voters.''

NEW YORK ON LESS:
 Save, or Splurge
 On a Vacation?
 Spring-break season has come and gone, and it is getting late to plan a summer vacation. But waiting could be paying off, because the bargains seem to be growing more tantalizing by the hour. 
 One day, a search on Travelzoo showed that Continental Airlines was offering flights to Montreal for $128 each way. Then, Air France was selling round trips to Berlin for $298. 
 Rooms at the Sagamore resort on Lake George were going for $119 a night. Two nights at a Marriott overlooking Niagara Falls went for $207. 
 After the recession turned 2008 into the Year of the Staycation, the travel industry is doing its part to lure people away from home. 
 Is it working on you? Will you splurge on that suddenly affordable trip of a lifetime? 
 Or will you save your dwindling dollars and spend your time off this year reading beside the nearest pond/pool/birdbath, imagining it is Lake Como? 
 Post your thoughts on the blog.

 TAKING
 QUESTIONS
 This week, Lawrence Kaplan and Carol P. Kaplan, the authors of ''Between Ocean and City: The Transformation of Rockaway, New York,'' will answer questions about the history of the once popular seaside resort in south Queens. Submit questions online; the first set of answers will appear on the blog Wednesday.
 Shortly after World War II, large parts of the narrow peninsula between the ocean and the bay became some of New York City's worst slums. Mr. Kaplan, a historian, and his wife, a social worker, present an account of the transformation, exploring issues of race, class and social policy and offering a significant revision of the larger story of New York City's development. 
 In particular, the authors qualify some of the negative assessments of Robert Moses, suggesting that the ''power broker'' tried to bring many positive initiatives to the area.
 Mr. Kaplan, who has taught British and American history at the City College of New York, spent his formative years in Rockaway. Ms. Kaplan is a practicing social worker and an associate professor at the Graduate School of Social Service at Fordham University.

HEADLINE: Tickets Cost Too Much? Check Back Tomorrow

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
Setting ticket prices to sports events requires that one hope for the best but prepare for the worst. Teams want prices high enough to cash in if they play well, but need them to be low enough to draw fans if they falter.
 But because teams set their prices months before opening day and resist changing them later, they have trouble reacting to the unexpected, like the weather, winning and losing teams or, this year, the ferocity of an economic downturn.
 The San Francisco Giants are experimenting with a possible solution -- software that weighs ticket sales data, weather forecasts, upcoming pitching matchups and other variables to help decide whether the team should raise or lower prices right up until game day.
 The Giants are the first major league team to test the software, which some industry analysts say could transform the way teams adjust to the ebb and flow of the season, not unlike how airlines, hotels and rental car companies -- which also use dynamic pricing -- adjust to changes in the travel industry. 
 Many teams have various ticket prices for the same seats, altering the dollar amount based on the opponent, the day of the week and the time of the year, but those variations are set before the season and not altered. The Giants, by being more fluid, are taking the concept a step further. 
 The system has the potential to change how fans shop for tickets and to win back the bargain hunters and die-hard fans willing to pay top dollar at resellers like StubHub.
 ''Consumers are already paying a multitude of prices on the secondary market,'' said Dan Migala, the director of the graduate program in sports administration at Northwestern University. ''Gone are the days of teams having just three or four ticket prices.''
 Teams have looked at tinkering with prices at midseason for some time, but they have been reluctant to do so for fear of alienating season-ticket holders, who pay upfront for their seats and may be offended if fans sitting nearby paid far less for their tickets.
 Still, discounts were hardly an issue in San Francisco. In the first eight years after they moved into what is now AT&T Park in 2000, the Giants regularly drew capacity crowds. If anything, they often wished they could raise prices.
 ''All those years when Barry Bonds was here hitting those home runs, what were we thinking?'' Russ Stanley, the Giants' vice president for ticket services, said as he ruminated on what might have been had the Giants altered prices from week to week as Bonds's various home run pursuits intensified. ''The world is ready for this.''
 With Bonds gone and the Giants finishing last season in fourth place in the five-team National League West, attendance fell 11 percent, to below three million for the first time since 1999. Ticket sales so far this year are up 1.7 percent, but at one April game, attendance fell below 30,000 for the first time in the park's history.
 The Giants are not alone in trying to adjust to the recession. The Toronto Blue Jays have hosted ''Messin' with Recession'' nights, when fans get tickets for as little as $5, hot dogs for $1 and discounted merchandise. The San Diego Padres are selling two-for-one tickets to some games. The Los Angeles Dodgers gave away ''Mannywood'' T-shirts to fans who bought seats in left field.
 Like many teams, the Giants have tiers of ticket prices. The highest-priced ''premium'' games include opening day and the games against Oakland and the Los Angeles Dodgers during the summer. The next tier includes ''feature'' games against the Dodgers in April and weekend games during the summer. The lowest price level includes all other games.
 The Giants' dynamic pricing experiment affects 2,000 of the 41,000 seats at the stadium. The team chose four sections in the upper deck in left field with 1,200 seats and three sections in the left-field bleachers that typically are among the last to sell. No season tickets were sold there.
 Because the seats often went empty, the team felt that cutting prices to as low as $5 could entice more fans to sit there. They in turn might buy hot dogs, beers and other concessions. Fans at AT&T Park spend on average $22 a game on food and merchandise.
 Conversely, the team charges more for the seats -- which are regularly $10 in the upper deck and $17 in the bleachers -- when demand is high, like last weekend, when the Mets were in San Francisco.
 For the game against the Mets on Thursday, a blustery night, the Giants shaved $1 off their upper-deck seats and $2 off their bleacher seats. But for the Friday night game, when the Giants' ace, Tim Lincecum, was on the mound, the upper-deck seats went for $19 and the bleacher seats jumped to $27, including a $2 increase on the day of the game.
 On Saturday, with Johan Santana paired against Randy Johnson, the Giants raised the price of bleacher seats to $33, including a $2 increase on game day; seats in the upper deck were again $19. On Sunday, bleacher seats went for $23 and sold out in a few days because Lincecum bobblehead dolls were given away.
 Through the first 17 home games, sales of dynamically priced tickets rose 20 percent, compared with sales in those sections during the same period last year. That works out to about 500 extra tickets a game.
 But it is unclear whether cheaper tickets alone helped boost sales, or whether the team's improved performance and the mix of competitors, including the rival Dodgers, were responsible. The Giants also hosted a Filipino heritage night that drew a big crowd.
 The team is also tinkering with the algorithm that it uses to determine the best time to lower or raise prices. Opposing pitchers and hitters are assigned values on a five-point scale. But if the highly regarded Cole Hamels of the Phillies does not pitch in San Francisco, the Giants may not raise prices when the team is in town.
 A single group sale of 100 tickets may misrepresent fan interest. The Cubs draw well even when they are doing poorly. Each day, the calculation changes as starting pitchers are announced, team records change and tickets are sold, prompting the team to recalibrate prices.
 Thus far, much of this is lost on the fans. Karla Marroquin, who lives in Petaluma, north of San Francisco, did not know the four upper-deck seats she bought last month had prices that were adjusted. 
 She originally wanted to attend the game on April 28, but when she saw the same seats the next night were a few dollars cheaper, she chose those.
 ''The pricing makes it worthwhile when you look at the overall cost of the game, the parking, the tolls, the food,'' Marroquin said. ''We used to go to the A's games because of the cheaper prices, but now with the variable pricing, I might go to the Giants more often.''
 Megan Romero, who lives in San Francisco, said she was also unaware of the new pricing system. 
 She bought her bleacher seats because they were the cheapest available. Now that she knows that other seats may be discounted, she said she would start hunting for bargains.
 ''It's not the way I shop for things,'' Romero said. ''But if the ticket is all of a sudden $6 on a Wednesday night, I might decide to go.''

GRAPHIC: CHART: PRICING BASEBALL TICKETS TO SELL: The San Francisco Giants have teamed up with QCue, a software company, to determine when and how to raise and lower ticket prices, depending on sales and a variety of other factors like weather forecasts, pitching matchups, team records, etc. Here are the prices and tickets sold for a game on Sunday, May 31, against the Cardinals. The tickets are for 841 bleacher seats.

PERSON: Susanna Agnelli 

HEADLINE: Susanna Agnelli, 87, Italian Foreign Minister

BYLINE: By RACHEL DONADIO; Reprinted from Sunday's late editions.

DATELINE: ROME 

 BODY:
Susanna Agnelli, a scion of the Fiat car dynasty, the only female foreign minister in Italian history and a formidable presence who brought American-style philanthropy to Italy, died Friday in Rome. She was 87. 
 She died at the Gemelli Clinic from complications after a broken hip, said her daughter Priscilla Rattazzi Whittle of New York.
 Susanna, or Suni, as she was known, was the granddaughter of Giovanni Agnelli, who founded Fiat. Both the carmaker and the Agnelli family, Italy's answer to the Kennedys, came to epitomize Italian glamour and innovation during the economic boom that followed World War II. 
 Ms. Agnelli was a confidante of her dashing brother, Giovanni Agnelli, known as Gianni, who served as Fiat chairman for 30 years. 
 After his death in 2003, Ms. Agnelli successfully rallied her siblings to keep Fiat in the family.
 Now led by Gianni's grandson, the company is trying to acquire a stake in Chrysler. 
 A striking woman who let her hair go gray, spoke her mind and dressed smartly in pantsuits, Ms. Agnelli was the antithesis of the showy television celebrities who dominate Italian culture today. 
 Ms. Agnelli started a career in politics in the 1970s, when she became mayor of Monte Argentario, a village on the Tuscan coast where the family had a home. 
 She soon broadened her ambitions, serving as a member of Parliament from the center-left Republican Party and later as a member of the European Parliament. 
 In 1983 she was named under secretary of state for foreign affairs, a post she held until the early 1990s. In 1995 and 1996 Ms. Agnelli served as foreign minister in the centrist government of Lamberto Dini. 
 ''She was the most efficient person that I ever met,'' Mario d'Urso, a family friend, said Saturday. ''She was able to obtain whatever she wanted, much more than Gianni.'' 
 Ms. Agnelli's son Lupo Rattazzi, reached Saturday, said affectionately, ''My mother was a pretty bossy character.'' 
 She was active in environmental causes, and she helped bring an American-style televised fund-raiser to Italy that still raises millions of dollars annually for medical research. 
 In her best-selling 1975 memoir, ''We Always Wore Sailor Suits,'' Ms. Agnelli recalled her childhood in Turin, where, under the tutelage of an English nanny, she and her six siblings were taught, ''Don't forget that you are an Agnelli.''
 Born April 24, 1922, Susanna Agnelli came of age during World War II. At 20, she left a convent school in London to work for the Red Cross, serving on ships carrying wounded soldiers. After the war, she married Count Urbano Rattazzi. The couple had six children. They divorced in 1971.
 In the early 1970s, when the Red Brigades were threatening industrialists in Italy, Ms. Agnelli lived for a time in New York. Sunday brunches at her home on Park Avenue became legendary, bringing together a wide range of notables, including Senator Jacob K. Javits and Andy Warhol, according to Mr. d'Urso. 
 She kept a home in New York until her death. ''She loved New York,'' her daughter Priscilla recalled. 
 Ms. Agnelli is survived by her 6 children, as well as 14 grandchildren and 2 great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: All Disasters Are Local

BYLINE: By STEVEN T. GANYARD. 
Stephen T. Ganyard is a former deputy assistant secretary of state and Marine Corps fighter pilot.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
 AMERICA seems to have dodged a bullet with the swine flu epidemic -- yet this was more the result of the virus being less deadly than feared rather than of any government coordination.
 Despite billions spent since 9/11, we are still not well prepared to react to disease outbreaks, terrorist attacks and natural disasters -- a fact Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano has been frank about in her brief time on the job. She has ruffled feathers by criticizing a $25 million national-security exercise the department undertook in 2007 as being too expensive, too unrealistic and ''too removed from a real-world scenario.'' But her frustration is well founded and indicative of larger fundamental flaws.
 The big problem is that coordination among state and local governments and Washington has been only incrementally improved in recent years. The national exercise system is broken, focusing too much on senior officials and neglecting training at the state and local levels. There is a better way. 
 Several years ago, while in command of a Marine air group in Southern California, I looked for ways for us to help local authorities during a natural disaster. What I found was a disturbing lack of coordination among city, county and regional agencies, and independent organizations. Marines had the training to be of great help in, say, an earthquake, but it was not clear where we would fit in with all the other agencies involved. 
 Since every government agency is given a budget for training, we wondered why we didn't all train together. We found our first partners in the City and County of Los Angeles. Together we devised a collaborative disaster response training event we called Golden Phoenix. Each year since 2006, we have undertaken a realistic and detailed disaster exercise that plays out over several days and involves disparate organizations dedicated to a common goal -- saving American lives. The 2006 and '07 Golden Phoenix events simulated the effects of devastating earthquakes in Los Angeles and Orange County; last year's operation involved a mock bioterrorism attack on San Diego that evolved into a widespread medical emergency. 
 From the start, a key has been making participation voluntary and open to any organization, public or private, willing to use its own funds. Because we didn't ask for complete control or mandate performance benchmarks, we found plenty of groups eager to participate and willing to experiment. We had hospitals, green-energy firms, software developers, communications groups and aerospace companies -- even an international cargo-shipping line -- as well as nongovernmental groups like the Red Cross involved.
 We also found that there are economies to be had in this collaborative approach. Golden Phoenix 2008 involved more than 150 local, state, federal, tribal, academic, nongovernmental and private sector entities, yet it required no additional spending outside the various groups' training budgets (well, except for $535 spent on coffee and doughnuts). 
 Golden Phoenix is based on the premise that, like politics, all disasters are local. That is, improved safety and security for the people of St. Louis is best created in St. Louis, not Washington. More attention needs to be paid to the local and regional levels if we are ''to prepare for and respond to natural and man-caused disasters with speed, skill and effectiveness,'' as Ms. Napolitano said in her confirmation hearing. 
 In responding to crises, the most persistent problem is that of collaboration -- people with information and equipment who are unable to share it with those who need it most. The means to effective collaboration is social networking and exploiting the natural mutual attractions of communities with common interests. 
 Federal agencies, however, often rely on the sort of top-down, set-piece exercises Secretary Napolitano rightly denounced. Usually intended to validate broad protocols with mandates to meet fixed goals, they induce fear of failure and rarely allow -- much less encourage -- experimentation. Participants are usually reluctant to try new techniques because of a risk of institutional embarrassment. Worse, performance in formal exercises is often tied to future financing; thus the threat of lost jobs or promotions discourages adaptation and modernization. 
 The Marines in my unit overcame any fears on the part of other participants by earning their trust and acting as a neutral third party. We functioned as social lubricant and catalyst, not dictating terms or seeking to control, but rather creating trust in exercises in which there was no penalty for failure. In one instance, a senior California official expressed amazement that we were able to get police officers and sheriff's deputies, members of two cultures often at odds, to collaborate. As one Los Angeles Police Department captain said, ''You have helped us more in one day than the feds have in 10 years.'' 
 The personal relationships created by Golden Phoenix have had a real payoff: they have been instrumental in combating California wildfires, improving communications between government agencies and rescue workers in Los Angeles, even saving a climber's life on Mount Whitney. Two participants -- Angel Flight West, which provides free air travel for those with severe medical problems, and Project K.I.D., which aids children during natural disasters -- formed a partnership to pre-screen pilots who can be at the ready to reunite children and their parents separated by disaster. 
 The degree of personal trust at the tactical level, not money or machines, is the single most important determinant of how well communities will deal with threats and disasters. But these relationships must be established in training so that first responders are not handing out business cards to one another on the way to the disaster. In addition, preparation can sort out any questions as to what the military's proper role will be in a disaster and spare us the sort of legal haggling that helped hamstring the federal response to Hurricane Katrina. 
 In Golden Phoenix, because we are not tied to performance, we have been able to conduct diverse experiments that directly address the needs of citizens affected by disaster, like how to deal with large displaced populations, surges in patients arriving at hospitals, and reuniting families after a disaster. In the middle of an exercise in which a port had been contaminated by a bio-weapons attack, I watched as a ponytailed neuroscientist gathered his impromptu team -- a software engineer, a medical researcher and a firefighter -- in the back of a Marine helicopter to work on an innovative solution for urban decontamination. 
 In another instance, we discovered that the adapters we had wouldn't connect civilian radios with military ones, which work on their own frequency bands. So a Marine, a firefighter and a civilian Navy employee hopped in a truck, purchased some parts from a local electronics store and, working in a tent pitched beside a hot and dusty desert airport, built a cable adapter that finally established civil-military communications. It was a $25 solution to a multimillion- dollar problem. 
 That on-the-fly breakthrough came in handy in fighting fires outside San Diego in 2007, when the cable was used to help establish civil-military interoperability. 
 If our simulated attack had been an actual disaster, people might have died before communications were restored. Solving these and more complex problemsbefore a disaster occurs will not come from doing senior-level ''table-top'' exercises but from hands-on training at the regional and local level. 
 In responding to disasters, Americans must look beyond government for help. Most of the critical infrastructure of the country is in private hands, and much of humanitarian relief is provided by local churches and relief charities. We need ''whole of society'' not just ''whole of government'' responses.
 Golden Phoenix made clear that state and local officials do not want imposed, top-down solutions. They prefer what they would find at a local hardware store: readily available tools and materials, and assistance from experts who can help them find their own solutions. The federal government can be most helpful by providing what state and local officials are often short of in an emergency: transportation, communication bandwidth and portable electric power. Generally, other kinds of federal ''help'' can be disruptive. 
 In encouraging local and regional training, the new administration has a chance to make the American people safer and government more effective -- without increased spending. Secretary Napolitano clearly sees the need, but it is going to take a willingness to challenge entrenched bureaucracies and listen to new approaches and ideas. Unlike the swine flu, our next national emergency might not take care of itself.

HEADLINE: Report Weighs Fallout of Canada's Oil Sands

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
In the tense debate between energy security and environmental sustainability, Canada's vast oil sand reserves hold a special place. 
 Canada has the second-largest petroleum deposits after Saudi Arabia and the biggest in the Western hemisphere. Its oil sands produce 1.3 million barrels of oil a day, up from 600,000 a day in 2000. As a result, Canada has become the biggest foreign oil supplier to the United States, accounting for 19 percent of imports in 2008.
 But the development of these sands in the Alberta region has also been sharply criticized by ecological groups, local communities and even Catholic bishops, for their impact on the environment, and their intensive use of both water and natural gas. 
 The growth in oil sands is the reason Canada has failed to contain its greenhouse gas emissions in recent years despite its commitments to do so. Critics refer to the bituminous deposits as tar sands, calling them the dirtiest fossil fuels on earth. 
 Trying to balance the size of Canada's reserves and their environmental impact is a tough act. But a new report, to be released Monday by IHS CERA, an energy consulting group, sees big opportunities for the oil sands, shrouded in vast uncertainty. 
 ''The oil sands are an immense resource in North America, and so they represent an opportunity to enhance energy security,'' said James Burkhard, the managing director of IHS CERA's global oil group. ''But there are also questions about the future economic feasibility of oil sands, given the drop in oil prices, and second, there are a number of issues related to greenhouse gases, land and water use, on which there is a wide spectrum of views.'' 
 Producing fuels from oil sands requires large amounts of natural gas and water and produces large quantities of waste material and carbon dioxide. In one process, steamed water is injected at high pressure to melt the dense, oil-bearing bitumen. In another, the sands are strip-mined and then cooked to release the oil. 
 Environmentalists would like President Obama to set strict limits on some of the dirtiest fuels, including heavy oil from Canada. They urge the administration to resist calls by the Canadian government to exempt oil sands from greenhouse regulations now being considered in the United States. 
 Canada's oil sands industry has been hit hard by the recession and a 60 percent drop in oil prices since their peak last year. As prices tumbled, more than 70 percent of proposed heavy oil projects were postponed. But if economic growth eventually pushes up oil demand and prices rebound, the oil sand production could rise as high as 6.3 million barrels a day by 2035, according to CERA's report. On the other hand, stringent regulation, weak economic growth or low energy prices could trim investments and result in production of as little as 2.3 million barrels a day within the next two decades, according to the report. 
 One of the most controversial issues related to oil sands is figuring out how much they contribute to global warming. According to CERA, which provided an analysis of 11 previous studies, producing oil sands emit 30 to 70 percent more greenhouse gases than the average oil consumed in the United States. 
 The CERA report points out, however, that once the total life of the fuel is considered, from the production phase to when the fuels are burned in engines -- a so-called wells-to-wheels analysis -- oil sands emit only 5 to 15 percent more greenhouse gases than the average fuels consumed in the country. The difference, CERA says, comes because 70 to 80 percent of total emissions come from the combustion of refined products, like gasoline and diesel, irrespective of their source. 
 The report recommends more research to reduce the use of natural gas in the production of oil from sands, as well as investing in technology that captures and stores carbon dioxide underground instead of emitting it into the atmosphere.
 But environmental advocates point out that while Congress is looking at cutting carbon emissions in the United States 80 percent by 2050, the growing reliance on oil sands from Canada would offset some of those benefits.
 ''It's not small potatoes when you stack it up against efforts to get carbon reductions,'' said Matt Price, an analyst at Environmental Defence in Toronto.

HEADLINE: Taxing Fairly and Spending Wisely

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''The G.D.P. Question'' (Op-Ed, May 11):
 Former Senator Bob Packwood is correct that more government spending ultimately requires more taxes, and more taxes leave less money for taxpayers to spend as they want.
 However, he completely ignores the other half of the equation. Most government spending gives people more money to spend as they want. Every dollar in a Social Security check is a dollar that the retired worker can spend. Every payment of a doctor's bill by Medicare or Medicaid reduces what the patient is otherwise obligated to pay, leaving him or her with another dollar to spend on other things. Every dollar spent for a paycheck for a government worker is a dollar that worker can spend. 
 Donald S. Grubbs Jr. Newtown, Pa., May 11, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Bob Packwood tells us that ''the real question is not how much we want to tax, but how much we want to spend.'' But the real question is not how much we want to spend, but what we want to spend it on.
 While it is true that President Obama is on course to spend even more than his predecessor, he has chosen to spend the money to increase wealth. Instead of bombing infrastructure we are building it. And national health care will not only create a healthier, more productive population, but will also enable employee mobility that further enhances economic productivity.
 Yes, we may be spending more, but it is also the case that we are spending more wisely. In the end that means we will have more wealth, not less. 
 Lee Newberg Albany, May 11, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Former Senator Bob Packwood asks an excellent question: Exactly how much are we willing to spend? Somewhere between ''little to nothing'' and ''as much as we need'' is an amount that average taxpaying Americans are willing to spend.
 American taxpayers have an obligation to consider the cost, in taxes, to them, and not only to the ''rich.'' The sooner they know, the better able they will be to answer this question. The problem, of course, is that the party in power has completely sidestepped this question by falsely conveying the idea that the ''rich'' will be the ones to pay.
 American taxpayers need to wake up and smell the coffee. 
 Andrea Economos Scarsdale, N.Y., May 11, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Instead of asking ''how much we want to tax,'' Bob Packwood asks ''how much we want to spend.'' But the truly substantive question is what do we want government to do?
 Do we want policemen and firefighters and National Guardsmen, and do we want them properly trained and equipped? We've seen the alternatives: the incompetent response to Katrina, sending our children to Iraq without armor.
 Do we want national health care? We've seen the alternatives: rising costs, closing hospitals, nursing shortages, thousands of unnecessary deaths.
 Do we want Social Security? We've seen the alternative: Before Social Security, the elderly were the poorest people in America. And we've also seen what can happen to privatized retirement accounts.
 How much to tax and how much to spend is just the math. The hard part is quality of life, and which and how many of us get to enjoy it.
 David Berman New York, May 11, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Bob Packwood's article states: ''If we spent like the Nordic countries, we could provide government-paid maternity leave, subsidize college tuition and offer a health plan that was close to free for all Americans. But this would leave significantly less money for taxpayers to spend as they want.''
 This perspective ignores the fact that most Americans do want health care, maternity leave and college tuition, and directly or indirectly spend plenty of money on these goods and services. 
 The problem is that we procure these public goods and services from markets that operate for private profit. 
 When are we going to catch up with the Nordic countries, and recognize that health care and education for all are good for everyone, and should not be limited to those who won the birth (and thus the wealth) lottery?

HEADLINE: G.M. Seeks More Imports From Low-Wage Regions

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
General Motors is engaged in negotiating a reorganization that could increase vehicle imports from its plants in Mexico and Asia while closing factories and cutting the work force in the United States.
 That approach drew a sharp rebuke from the United Automobile Workers union on Friday. In a letter to each member of Congress, the U.A.W., which represents G.M. factory workers, argued that to qualify for more government assistance, the auto giant should be required ''to maintain the maximum number of jobs in the United States.'' 
 The administration, however, appears to accept the proposition that to return to profitability as quickly as possible, G.M. must import a significant percentage of cars from its plants in low-wage countries, like Mexico and China, or low-cost countries, like Japan. 
 G.M. already imports a third of the vehicles that go to showrooms in this country. That percentage would not change in the plan that G.M. is preparing to submit to the administration to justify billions of dollars in new loans to stave off collapse. G.M. would emerge a smaller company, with fewer employees and less output in this country and abroad. But imports would rise from low-cost countries, particularly Mexico and China, and that would be offset by fewer imports from Canada and Europe. 
 Some economists, like David Autor of M.I.T., say that G.M. cars made in China, among other countries, ''are pretty competitive and could be sold here.''
 Others, like Harley Shaiken, at the University of California, Berkeley, argue that if G.M. focused more intensely on technology and auto quality, it could concentrate production in the United States and still be competitive. ''The other way to go,'' he said, ''is to cut costs by importing more vehicles from Mexico and China, and lifting the bottom line that way.'' 
 A Treasury spokeswoman said over the weekend that ''G.M. and the U.A.W. are in active and constructive deliberations around all aspects of their plan. This is one of several issues they are focused on and the administration is supportive of their efforts to come to a resolution.''
 G.M. is asking Washington for billions of dollars more in federal loans to survive, on top of the $15.4 billion already borrowed. In a presentation to Congress, the company laid out the plan for the shifts in production to lower-cost countries. In the United States, G.M. would close 16 of its remaining 47 plants and eliminate an additional 21,000 jobs. The company also announced on Friday that 1,100 dealers would be eliminated from its American network by the fall of next year. 
 In the letter to Congress on Friday, Alan Reuther, the U.A.W.'s legislative director, also argued that if G.M. cut back production in Canada, it would hurt small manufacturers in the United States that supply parts to G.M.'s Canadian assembly plants. 
 But the Obama administration apparently sees interference in such plans as crossing a line into industrial policy, rather than helping a giant multinational get back on its feet as a successful, privately managed global operation. Insisting that G.M. preserve American jobs by shifting production to the United States from abroad, this argument goes, would require many times more in federal aid than the $16.3 billion in loans now anticipated.
 ''The idea is to get G.M. off the government dole,'' Mr. Autor said. ''And if that is the case, then one has to take the steps that a free-standing company must take to be profitable.''

HEADLINE: Notes From Another Credit Card Crisis

BYLINE: By SUKI KIM. 
Suki Kim is the author of ''The Interpreter,'' a novel.

DATELINE: Seoul 

 BODY:
 AS President Obama stages a populist campaign against credit card companies' predatory practices, the United States Senate is working on new regulations to protect card holders. Meanwhile, Americans' credit card debt has risen to the point where it now tops $960 billion. And with the economy in a downswing, it's hard to see how the debt can ever be paid back.
 If it's any consolation, South Koreans have been there, done that and come out alive -- if just barely. 
 In 1999, after the Asian financial crisis, the South Korean government encouraged banks to issue credit cards to as many people as possible as a way to increase consumer spending (as well as to make it easier to collect taxes, which had been harder to monitor in a predominantly cash economy). 
 Hong Kwon-heui, a columnist for Dong-A Ilbo, a South Korean newspaper, recalled how, in the early 2000s, the streets of Seoul were littered with credit card vendors. Sitting in a Starbucks facing Sejong Avenue, he told me, ''They were literally handing them out to college students, to the unemployed, to anyone who had time to fill out an application.'' He said, ''The country was force-feeding its people debts.''
 South Koreans became hooked on plastic so dizzyingly fast that by 2003 they owned on average four credit cards each and their collective debts amounted to about $100 billion. 
 The cards had an additional allure as a status symbol, because previously in South Korea only the elite had them. ''When I used credit cards, I somehow felt that others regarded me highly and that gave me confidence -- and I forgot that I needed to pay it all back later,'' said Kang Hee-yun, an office worker in her mid-40s, who eventually had to resort to ''card kiting,'' the trick of using one card to repay the debt on another. 
 The bill soon came due for many South Koreans. In 2003, a 34-year-old housewife harassed by creditors leapt to her death from her high-rise apartment after pushing out her three children. Families unraveled as their breadwinners lost their savings. A sudden surge in crime and prostitution led South Koreans to bemoan their ''bankrupted society.'' Finally, after millions had defaulted on payments, the government stepped in to help bail out LG Card, then the country's largest issuer.
 ''The excess was similar to what's happening with the American housing market today,'' recalled Song Ji-hoon, a Rolex-wearing lawyer in his mid-30s who worked on behalf of one of the credit card companies. ''Koreans wanted fancy cars, bigger TVs -- although there was no real money to buy them -- much the way those Americans thought that they could own houses with nothing but loans. Of course, in both instances, banks got greedy extending credits and mortgages to people who couldn't pay back.''
 It's true that South Korea's economic path bears little resemblance to America's. In the 1960s, the South Korean government had nationalized the banks and divided the country's resources among a handful of companies, including Samsung, Hyundai and LG. These family-owned conglomerates, known as the chaebol, dominated the economy. 
 In the early 2000s, the credit card divisions of Samsung and LG, trailed by Hyundai, competed fiercely in the new market. 
 Even today, despite the efforts of previous presidential administrations to decrease the power of the chaebol, it is still not unusual for a South Korean to wake up in a Samsung-made bed in a Samsung-built apartment, eat Samsung-manufactured food and drive a Samsung car to the office of a Samsung-affiliated company. Back in the early 2000s, a Samsung credit card, or one issued by Hyundai or LG, would have been another such extension. The chaebol had become the face of Korea, both domestically and abroad, and when their credit card divisions faltered in 2003, the South Korean government had little choice but to step in and ease social unrest by forgiving individual debts. The move was criticized by some as a return to the old ways of keeping the chaebol afloat.
 Still, the government's bailout worked. Although unemployment and personal bankruptcy rates remained high for a while, the worst was soon over. The credit card companies instituted stricter rules for issuing cards, and consumer spending plummeted briefly. 
 The real hangover can be seen in a shift in buying habits. Before the mass use of credit cards, Koreans had been big savers. In a culture where family members are expected to help one another financially, they put money away for everything. They also joined private money-pooling groups called ''gye,'' which allocate money for everything from children's school and weddings to the celebration of a parent's 60th birthday. In 1998, the household savings rate was 25 percent. By 2007, it had fallen to 2.5 percent. 
 South Korea managed to weather the storm, albeit with no shortage of heartbreak. Today Seoul's neon-lighted streets burst with credit-card friendly shops -- but high household debt has depressed spending. Some habits are hard to break. 
 Finishing his cappuccino, Mr. Hong, the newspaper columnist, opened his wallet to show me his cards. Not as many as he once had. One came with free passes to cultural events, another offered discounted loans. The third, well he couldn't recall which perks it offered -- save for comfort.

HEADLINE: New Mood In Antitrust May Affect Google

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR and MIGUEL HELFT

 BODY:
For decades, the nation's biggest antitrust cases have centered on technology companies. And they have all been efforts by the government to deal with powerful companies with far-reaching influence, like AT&T, the telephone monopoly; I.B.M., the mainframe computer giant; and Microsoft, the powerhouse of personal computer software.
 Last week, the Obama administration declared a sharp break with the Bush years, vowing to toughen antitrust enforcement, especially for dominant companies. The approach is closer to that of the European Union, where regulators last week fined Intel $1.45 billion for abusing its power in the chip market. 
 In this new climate, the stakes appear to be highest for Google, the rising power of the Internet economy.
 The new antitrust leadership, legal experts say, is likely to scrutinize networks -- technology platforms that become so dominant that everyone feels the need to plug into them. The advantages to the companies that control such networks snowball as they attract more users, advertisers or software developers.
 Internet search and search advertising, like personal computer operating software, is one example, said Herbert Hovenkamp, an antitrust expert at the University of Iowa law school. ''Google is a dominant network, as is Microsoft,'' Mr. Hovenkamp said. ''Networks become competitive only if everyone has the same chance.''
 Google's corporate behavior is already being closely monitored. Last year, Google abandoned a planned search advertising partnership with Yahoo after the Justice Department said it intended to file suit to block the agreement on antitrust grounds. Google has 64 percent of the Web search market in America, while Yahoo has 21 percent and Microsoft 8 percent, according to comScore, a research firm.
 In recent weeks, antitrust officials have opened two inquiries. The Justice Department is looking into Google's settlement with authors and publishers for its book-search service to see if it violates antitrust laws. And the Federal Trade Commission is examining whether Google's sharing two board members with Apple reduces competition, because both companies offer Web browsers and phone operating systems.
 Eric E. Schmidt, Google's chief executive, said this month that the close scrutiny was not surprising. ''Information is incredibly important, and we should expect governments around the world to pay attention to what we do,'' he said.
 Google's power is a cause of worry in many industries -- media, advertising, telecommunications and software. Yet being large, successful and ambitious is not an antitrust violation. ''You've got to be big, and you have to be bad,'' observed Andrew I. Gavil, a law professor at Howard University. ''You have to be both.''
 In the Microsoft case, the software giant's monopoly in personal computer operating systems was not an antitrust problem. It was its corporate actions, including using contracts and bullying tactics to stifle competition, that broke the law, the federal courts ruled. Such strong-arm practices, legal experts say, have not been part of the Google story. 
 Unless Google is shown to engage in a pattern of anticompetitive conduct, the company is likely to face constant scrutiny, but not a major federal suit, antitrust experts say. Even with misconduct, they say, complex antitrust cases like the one against Microsoft take years to come to fruition. ''There will be a lot of agonizing about Google, and it will raise concerns, but I don't see a big Google case in the offing,'' said Michael Katz, an economist at the Stern School of Business of New York University.
 Instead, Google is likely to be watched step by step. One area to observe, antitrust experts say, is whether Google uses its search engine to give it a leg up in new businesses. 
 Last month, the company announced that Google Profiles, a service that gives people a page to publish their name, photo and other personal information, would be featured below Google's search results when someone typed in a name. That could give Google Profiles an edge over profiles from Facebook and other social networks, which have to earn their search result rankings. 
 Google, said Randal C. Picker, an antitrust expert at the University of Chicago law school, is using its search engine to ''leverage'' another Google service. Such tactics, he said, echo Microsoft's linking of its Windows operating system to its Web browser. ''It is the kind of thing that is likely to get antitrust attention,'' Mr. Picker said.
 The company says Google Profiles is an effort to improve Web search, and comes in response to users' requests for greater control over their online identities. Google also says its software scans other social networks, and those results typically appear near the top of a search for a person's name. ''We designed Profiles to encourage user choice, not limit it,'' said Adam Kovacevich, a Google spokesman.
 In her speech last week, Christine A. Varney, head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, said the touchstone of antitrust policy should be ''the protection of consumer welfare.''
 By that standard, Google seems an elusive target for antitrust enforcers, since most of its services are free. And in the new markets it is entering, including cellphone software and online alternatives to desktop programs, Google is an insurgent going up against large, well-heeled rivals, notably Microsoft.
 ''If what Google really has is an enormous scale advantage in Internet search and advertising -- and it is not engaged in exclusionary or other bad behavior -- I would be very reluctant to step in,'' said Mr. Hovenkamp of the University of Iowa.

HEADLINE: First Women Win Seats in Kuwait Parliament; Political Deadlock Seems Likely to Continue

BYLINE: By ROBERT F. WORTH

DATELINE: SANA, Yemen 

 BODY:
Women won four seats in the Kuwaiti parliamentary elections over the weekend, a historic first and one of several electoral surprises that appeared to reflect a deep popular frustration with the political deadlock in the oil-rich gulf state of Kuwait. 
 Liberal Kuwaitis celebrated the landmark with fireworks and parties after the elections on Saturday. Women gained the right to vote and run for office in 2005, but none had been elected until now. Many conservatives resisted the idea, and in recent weeks Islamists urged voters not to elect women to the 50-seat assembly.
 The elections came two months after Kuwait's ruler, Sheik Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah, dissolved Parliament to end its latest standoff with the cabinet. It was the third time in three years that there had been such a standoff. Each time, lawmakers accused cabinet members of misconduct or corruption, creating a noisy spectacle and cabinet resignations. Sheik Sabah has consistently reappointed as prime minister his nephew, Sheik Nasser al-Muhammad al-Sabah. 
 The tensions have slowed economic reforms in Kuwait that many analysts view as essential. 
 Such tensions seem likely to continue, despite some noteworthy electoral shifts, political analysts said. Sunni Islamist candidates, who gained ground last year in the most recent election, lost some seats on Saturday, results showed. Liberals and independent candidates slightly increased their representation. 
 But many incumbents retained seats, including some who are widely considered to be responsible for the confrontations with the executive branch.
 Voter turnout was down, and some popular incumbents won by narrow margins, in an apparent sign of discontent with many members of Parliament over the political turmoil.
 ''The main theme of this election was frustration,'' said Ghanim al-Najjar, a newspaper columnist who is a professor of political science at Kuwait University. ''People have a negative attitude toward the M.P.'s.''
 Kuwaitis are proud of their relatively democratic political traditions, an exception in a region dominated by autocracies. Parliament sets the emir's salary and is the nation's sole source of legislation. 
 But many believe that their country, one of the world's leading oil exporters, has fallen behind its autocratic gulf neighbors Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Some Kuwaitis are eager for public investment and economic reforms, and say the constant parliamentary battles are to blame.
 The election of women to the assembly is a separate matter and a source of intense pride for many Kuwaitis. 
 The winners were Rola Dashti, an American-educated economist; Salwa al-Jassar and Aseel al-Awadi, who are both professors; and Massouma al-Mubarak, who in 2005 became the country's first female cabinet minister.
 Some Kuwaitis said the election results might be less important than the announcement of the new cabinet in the coming weeks.
 ''If it's the same cabinet and the same prime minister, we will get the same result again,'' said Nasser al-Sane, an Islamist and former Parliament member.

HEADLINE: A Leadership Test For an Unbowed Pelosi

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
''However it happens, new leadership will emerge,'' the historians of the House wrote. ''The next strong leader will likely be as different from Newt Gingrich as Gingrich is from Sam Rayburn, as Rayburn was from Nicholas Longworth, and Longworth from Joe Cannon.''
 Dick and Lynne Cheney's prediction came true. And now that very different leader, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, faces a leadership test just as Mr. Gingrich did soon after the Cheneys published ''Kings of the Hill'' in 1996. 
 Ms. Pelosi's test flows directly from a fierce conflict over national security policies that Mr. Cheney backed as vice president and were subsequently reversed by President Obama. But she insisted in an interview that Republican attacks on her truthfulness had not weakened her grip on power.
 ''Absolutely not,'' said Ms. Pelosi, a Democrat from San Francisco. ''If I were not effective, they wouldn't be making up their junk. That's their stock in trade. So as I say to the members, when you're effective, you're a target.''
 Lessons in Power
 The Cheneys' exploration of legislative leadership charted the careers of the speakers whose names now adorn office buildings on the House side of Capitol Hill.
 ''Uncle Joe'' Cannon amassed so much power early in the 20th century that he sparked rebellion among fellow Republicans. Nicholas Longworth, a political celebrity after marrying President Theodore Roosevelt's daughter, compensated for diminution of the office with a winning personal style. Sam Rayburn quietly safeguarded his influence by avoiding political fights unless he was certain to win.
 ''A leader may as well quit if his head is bloodied too often,'' Rayburn said. That happened to the combative Mr. Gingrich after the 1998 election, when Republicans lost House seats despite President Bill Clinton's disgrace over Monica Lewinsky.
 Ms. Pelosi has come under fire for her accounts of when she learned that the Bush administration had used ''enhanced interrogation techniques'' like waterboarding of terrorism suspects, and what she did about it. Last week, she picked a high-profile fight with the Central Intelligence Agency, accusing officials of misleading her during a 2002 briefing.
 Mr. Gingrich himself assailed Ms. Pelosi over that charge, calling it ''despicable'' and ''dishonest.'' But Republican rhetorical fire shows no sign of threatening her tenure after two House election successes and a solid legislative opening to Mr. Obama's tenure.
 ''Not one of these people has done anything to create one job,'' Ms. Pelosi said, invoking the economy to rebut her partisan critics. ''They want to create an illusion and get the spotlight off of their own lack of ideas and their own creation of this policy of torture.''
 To stop that policy, Ms. Pelosi added tartly, ''my job was to win -- and we won.''
 Her Own Way
 Ms. Pelosi does not always wait for directions from a Democratic White House. Early this year she scuttled the idea of a commission on shoring up the long-term finances of Medicare and Social Security, which fiscally conservative Democrats believed Mr. Obama was interested in.
 ''We had to pass our budget before we could go to the next step,'' Ms. Pelosi said. ''Others want to do other things, God bless them, but we have our responsibility. We represent the people.''
 Yet she has faithfully pressed Mr. Obama's immediate priorities, keeping fellow liberals moving forward on a plan to cap carbon dioxide emissions even though energy-state Democrats and party campaign strategists consider it risky -- economically, politically or both. ''If we do not move on to a new energy policy, it will be very costly to our economy,'' she said. 
 On health care, Mr. Clinton never got even a single committee vote for his reform plan. Ms. Pelosi promises that the House will pass one this summer.
 By the August Congressional recess, she said, ''We will have, as the president has called for, quality, affordable, accessible health care which will reduce cost.''
 The magnitude of that task underscores the pitfalls of her advocacy of a ''truth commission'' to explore the security controversies that ensnared her last week. If the first female speaker is to meet the first black president's call for historic policy shifts toward a ''new foundation'' for America's economy, she has barely more than seven months to do it, even without the additional distraction of a truth commission.
 ''We will have the most productive Congress in 70 years,'' Ms. Pelosi declared, pointing back to rapid action on New Deal legislation in President Franklin D. Roosevelt's first term. And she took special relish in asserting that Republicans cannot stop it by making her a lightning rod.
 ''They're having their fun,'' she noted, but ''they're wasting their time.''

HEADLINE: The Perfect, The Good, The Planet

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
In a way, it was easy to take stands during the Bush years: the Bushies and their allies in Congress were so determined to move the nation in the wrong direction that one could, with a clear conscience, oppose all the administration's initiatives. 
 Now, however, a somewhat uneasy coalition of progressives and centrists rules Washington, and staking out a position has become much trickier. Policy tends to move things in a desirable direction, yet to fall short of what you'd hoped to see. And the question becomes how many compromises, how much watering down, one is willing to accept. 
 There will be a lot of soul-searching later this year for advocates of health care reform. (For me the make-or-break issue is whether the legislation includes a public plan.) But right now it's the environmental community that has to decide how much it's willing to bend.
 If we're going to get real action on climate change any time soon, it will be via some version of legislation proposed by Representatives Henry Waxman and Edward Markey. Their bill would limit greenhouse gases by requiring polluters to receive or buy emission permits, with the number of available permits -- the ''cap'' in ''cap and trade'' -- gradually falling over time.
 It goes without saying that the usual suspects on the right have denounced Waxman-Markey: global warming isn't real, emission limits will destroy the economy, yada yada. But the bill also faces opposition from some environmentalists, who are balking at the compromises the sponsors made to gain political support.
 So is Waxman-Markey -- whose language was released last week -- good enough?
 Well, Al Gore has praised the bill, and plans to organize a grass-roots campaign on its behalf. A number of environmental organizations, ranging from the League of Conservation Voters to the Environmental Defense Fund, have also come out in strong support. 
 But Greenpeace has declared that it ''cannot support this bill in its current state.'' And some influential environmental figures -- most notably James Hansen, the NASA scientist who first drew the public's attention to global warming -- oppose the whole idea of cap and trade, arguing for a carbon tax instead.
 I'm with Mr. Gore. The legislation now on the table isn't the bill we'd ideally want, but it's the bill we can get -- and it's vastly better than no bill at all. 
 One objection -- the claim that carbon taxes are better than cap and trade -- is, in my view, just wrong. In principle, emission taxes and tradable emission permits are equally effective at limiting pollution. In practice, cap and trade has some major advantages, especially for achieving effective international cooperation. 
 Not to put too fine a point on it, think about how hard it would be to verify whether China was really implementing a promise to tax carbon emissions, as opposed to letting factory owners with the right connections off the hook. By contrast, it would be fairly easy to determine whether China was holding its total emissions below agreed-upon levels. 
 The more serious objection to Waxman-Markey is that it sets up a system under which many polluters wouldn't have to pay for the right to emit greenhouse gases -- they'd get their permits free. In particular, in the first years of the program's operation more than a third of the allocation of emission permits would be handed over at no charge to the power industry. 
 Now, these handouts wouldn't undermine the policy's effectiveness. Even when polluters get free permits, they still have an incentive to reduce their emissions, so that they can sell their excess permits to someone else. That's not just theory: allowances for sulfur dioxide emissions are allocated to electric utilities free of charge, yet the cap-and-trade system for SO2 has been highly successful at controlling acid rain. 
 But handing out emission permits does, in effect, transfer wealth from taxpayers to industry. So if you had your heart set on a clean program, without major political payoffs, Waxman-Markey is a disappointment. 
 Still, the bill represents major action to limit climate change. As the Center for American Progress has pointed out, by 2020 the legislation would have the same effect on global warming as taking 500 million cars off the road. And by all accounts, this bill has a real chance of becoming law in the near future.
 So opponents of the proposed legislation have to ask themselves whether they're making the perfect the enemy of the good. I think they are.
 After all the years of denial, after all the years of inaction, we finally have a chance to do something major about climate change. Waxman-Markey is imperfect, it's disappointing in some respects, but it's action we can take now. And the planet won't wait.

HEADLINE: PAKISTAN IS SEEN RAPIDLY ADDING NUCLEAR ARMS

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER and DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Members of Congress have been told in confidential briefings that Pakistan is rapidly adding to its nuclear arsenal even while racked by insurgency, raising questions on Capitol Hill about whether billions of dollars in proposed military aid might be diverted to Pakistan's nuclear program.
 Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, confirmed the assessment of the expanded arsenal in a one-word answer to a question on Thursday in the midst of lengthy Senate testimony. Sitting beside Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, he was asked whether he had seen evidence of an increase in the size of the Pakistani nuclear arsenal. 
 ''Yes,'' he said quickly, adding nothing, clearly cognizant of Pakistan's sensitivity to any discussion about the country's nuclear strategy or security. 
 Inside the Obama administration, some officials say, Pakistan's drive to spend heavily on new nuclear arms has been a source of growing concern, because the country is producing more nuclear material at a time when Washington is increasingly focused on trying to assure the security of an arsenal of 80 to 100 weapons so that they will never fall into the hands of Islamic insurgents. 
 The administration's effort is complicated by the fact that Pakistan is producing an unknown amount of new bomb-grade uranium and, once a series of new reactors is completed, bomb-grade plutonium for a new generation of weapons. President Obama has called for passage of a treaty that would stop all nations from producing more fissile material -- the hardest part of making a nuclear weapon -- but so far has said nothing in public about Pakistan's activities.
 Bruce Riedel, the Brookings Institution scholar who served as the co-author of Mr. Obama's review of Afghanistan-Pakistan strategy, reflected the administration's concern in a recent interview, saying that Pakistan ''has more terrorists per square mile than anyplace else on earth, and it has a nuclear weapons program that is growing faster than anyplace else on earth.''
 Obama administration officials said that they had communicated to Congress that their intent was to assure that military aid to Pakistan was directed toward counterterrorism and not diverted. But Admiral Mullen's public confirmation that the arsenal is increasing -- a view widely held in both classified and unclassified analyses -- seems certain to aggravate Congress's discomfort. 
 Whether that discomfort might result in a delay or reduction in aid to Pakistan is still unclear. 
 The Congressional briefings have taken place in recent weeks as Pakistan has descended into further chaos and as Congress has considered proposals to spend $3 billion over the next five years to train and equip Pakistan's military for counterinsurgency warfare. That aid would come on top of $7.5 billion in civilian assistance.
 None of the proposed military assistance is directed at the nuclear program. So far, America's aid to Pakistan's nuclear infrastructure has been limited to a $100 million classified program to help Pakistan secure its weapons and materials from seizure by Al Qaeda, the Taliban or ''insiders'' with insurgent loyalties.
 But the billions in new proposed American aid, officials acknowledge, could free other money for Pakistan's nuclear infrastructure, at a time when Pakistani officials have expressed concern that their nuclear program is facing a budget crunch for the first time, worsened by the global economic downturn. The program employs tens of thousands of Pakistanis, including about 2,000 believed to possess ''critical knowledge'' about how to produce a weapon. 
 The dimensions of the Pakistani buildup are not fully understood. ''We see them scaling up their centrifuge facilities,'' said David Albright, the president of the Institute for Science and International Security, which has been monitoring Pakistan's continued efforts to buy materials on the black market, and analyzing satellite photographs of two new plutonium reactors less than 100 miles from where Pakistani forces are currently fighting the Taliban.
 ''The Bush administration turned a blind eye to how this is being ramped up,'' he said. ''And of course, with enough pressure, all this could be preventable.''
 As a matter of diplomacy, however, the buildup presents Mr. Obama with a potential conflict between two national security priorities, some aides concede. One is to win passage of a global agreement to stop the production of fissile material -- the uranium or plutonium used to produce weapons. Pakistan has never agreed to any limits and is one of three countries, along with India and Israel, that never signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
 Yet the other imperative is a huge infusion of financial assistance into Afghanistan and Pakistan, money considered crucial to helping stabilize governments with tenuous holds on power in the face of terrorist and insurgent violence.
 Senior members of Congress were already pressing for assurances from Pakistan that the American military assistance would be used to fight the insurgency, and not be siphoned off for more conventional military programs to counter Pakistan's historic adversary, India. Official confirmation that Pakistan has accelerated expansion of its nuclear program only added to the consternation of those in Congress who were already voicing serious concern about the security of those warheads.
 During a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday, Senator Jim Webb, a Virginia Democrat, veered from the budget proposal under debate to ask Admiral Mullen about public reports ''that Pakistan is, at the moment, increasing its nuclear program -- that it may be actually adding on to weapons systems and warheads. Do you have any evidence of that?''
 It was then that Admiral Mullen responded with his one-word confirmation. Mr. Webb said Pakistan's decision was a matter of ''enormous concern,'' and he added, ''Do we have any type of control factors that would be built in, in terms of where future American money would be going, as it addresses what I just asked about?''
 Similar concerns about seeking guarantees that American military assistance to Pakistan would be focused on battling insurgents also were expressed by Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, the committee chairman.
 ''Unless Pakistan's leaders commit, in deeds and words, their country's armed forces and security personnel to eliminating the threat from militant extremists, and unless they make it clear that they are doing so, for the sake of their own future, then no amount of assistance will be effective,'' Mr. Levin said.
 A spokesman for the Pakistani government contacted Friday declined to comment on whether his nation was expanding its nuclear weapons program, but said the government was ''maintaining the minimum, credible deterrence capability.'' He warned against linking American financial assistance to Pakistan's actions on its weapons program.
 ''Conditions or sanctions on this issue did not work in the past, and this will not send a positive message to the people of Pakistan,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because his country's nuclear program is classified.

HEADLINE: The Slippery Slope From Fear to Panic

BYLINE: By JANE E. BRODY

 BODY:
Could a reason for the panicky reaction to the swine flu outbreak be that it diverted our attention, however briefly, from the devastating effects of the global financial crisis, not to mention the myriad chronic health issues that threaten millions of lives?
 Or is it simply human nature to overreact to threats over which we have little control?
 ''The fact is that we love to be scared,'' argue two British statisticians, Simon Briscoe and Hugh Aldersey-Williams, in ''Panicology,'' published in the United States this year by Skyhorse Publishing. Witness the immense popularity of disaster movies and thrillers.
 ''But there are serious emotional, social and economic costs to panic,'' Mr. Briscoe, a London-based economist for The Financial Times, said in an interview. ''We'd be a lot happier if we insisted that people prove their case before making dire pronouncements. We shouldn't be wasting time worrying about a lot of stupid things,'' and should focus instead on hazards we can do something about. 
 It's the wisdom to know the difference -- swine flu was new, potentially fatal and spreading -- that is hard to come by. We are bombarded by government and media reports of real or potential dangers, magnified to panic mode by ''24-hour rolling news from around the world,'' the authors wrote.
 They point in particular to the panic in 2005 and 2006 over bird flu, ''billed as an impending human pandemic that would wipe out a large proportion of the Earth's population.'' Yet in the end, this flu virus has killed fewer than 300 people worldwide, most of whom were in direct contact with infected birds. Hardly worth the worry when ''ordinary'' seasonal flu claims more than 30,000 American lives each winter.
 In the reaction to the current swine flu alarm, millions of lives have been disrupted and dollars lost. Schools have been closed, people quarantined, vacations and events canceled, exports and sales of pork derailed, and money wasted on face masks and antibacterial cleansers (the flu agent is a virus, untouched by anything antibacterial). 
 The Fears of Modern Times
 Paradoxically, the authors noted, ''modern life had greatly reduced many of the risks that humankind has to face, and yet it is modern life that seems to spawn most of our fears -- fears of chemical, biological, and nuclear war, pollution, terrorism, climate change, and, less directly, fears associated with immigration, aging, loss of cultural diversity, and much else besides.''
 In their analysis, ''It is almost as if we have to be afraid of something, as if we carry about in our heads a bucket of worry that we are compelled to fill with whatever's available.''
 In addition to the obvious toll from exaggerated disasters that never come to pass, there are more subtle and far more costly consequences. Most important, perhaps, is people's tendency to overlook well-established risks over which they have lots of control -- when taking action may actually save, not cost, money. 
 'What, Me Worry?'
 Perhaps public health messages would have a greater effect if they truly scared people, Mr. Briscoe said, noting that millions of people continue to smoke even though it will contribute to the deaths of half of them. 
 Likewise with foods and drinks that can undermine health. Most people are unwilling to forgo immediate pleasures for the sake of future gains. In response to a recent column on the mortality risks of eating red meat, a reader asked: ''How many weeks of life might I lose by eating a lot of meat? If it's only a few, that's a small price to pay for years of enjoyment.'' 
 Unfortunately, this isn't the kind of question that can be answered on an individual basis. If genetics or lifestyle render people susceptible to heart disease or cancer, adding excessive red meat to the mix might cut them down decades sooner than if they limited meat consumption. 
 On the other hand, like the occasional smoker who puffs away well into his 90s, some people can go scot-free eating all the meat they want. Like public health agencies that conduct briefings about swine flu, it's my job to spell out the risks so people can make informed decisions about their behavior.
 The ''Panicology'' authors put obesity into the category of risks that most people could avoid if they chose, describing it as a ''public health time-bomb.'' One-third of American adults are obese and at much greater risk of developing and dying early from diabetes, heart disease and cancer, among other disorders, than if they were of normal weight. 
 Acceptable Risks
 Many of the risks we take or avoid are based on false perceptions, rather than solid information. A classic example is the risk inherent in various modes of travel. 
 ''Transport accidents are the leading cause of accidental deaths after falls,'' the authors wrote. Yet while people are often most fearful of flying, they said, ''we face the greatest risks when we ourselves are at the controls. Per mile traveled, motorcycle, foot, bicycle and car are the most dangerous forms of transport, with rail and air the safest.''
 The level of risk we consider acceptable seems to be directly related to whether it's a risk we can choose ourselves. Scientists who have studied risk and risk perception have determined that the public seems willing to accept voluntary risks roughly 1,000 times greater than involuntary risks. 
 Statistically, to prevent avoidable loss of life, instead of driving or walking, we should go everywhere by train or plane. The ''Panicology'' authors suggest further, ''If we want to cut road accidents, perhaps we should ban pedestrians from crossing the road while using their cellphones.''
 ''Panicology'' considers the evidence on both sides of a large number of worries that have beset the industrialized world in modern times, including the ''population crisis'' (now one of underpopulation that threatens the wealth and health of aging populations in countries like Italy and Russia); the effect of the mumps-measles-rubella vaccine on autism (none, it turns out); the effect of climate change on extreme weather like hurricanes and other life-changing events (real and a far greater threat than terrorism); earthquakes (''hundreds of millions of people live with the daily risk of extermination by the Earth's geophysical might,'' including an estimated 75 million Americans in 39 states), and genetically modified foods (foods have been genetically modified for thousands of years through hybridization with far less predictable results). 
 For each topic considered, the authors assign a quasi-numerical score of the degree of panic, risk and a person's ability to reduce the risk. All too often, the panic level far exceeds the actual risk. In other cases, the risk could be reduced or eliminated by exercising personal control. It is worth remembering that worry itself is a risk, a stress that can undermine health and happiness.

HEADLINE: Yes, I Look Fabulous, But Inside I'm Saving

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
In a place where appearance is almost everything, and where studio back lots are filled with fancy veneers concealing plywood and chicken wire, hard times are summoning a distinctly Hollywood response: maintaining a fabulous facade on the cheap while paring expenses behind the scenes.
 Locals joke that the only slimming down this town knows is liposuction, but the higher-end shopping districts quickly disprove that theory. Robertson Boulevard, home to the celebrated Ivy restaurant, has 12 storefronts empty or emptying on just a five-block stretch. On Montana Avenue in Santa Monica, about 30 boutiques are either closed, about to close or vacant, according to the merchants' association. 
 ''The trendonistas still flock to Barneys, but it's just to eat lunch and buy a lipstick,'' said Leslie Wright, a fashion-forward executive at Bonhams & Butterfields, the art auctioneer. ''That way,'' she continued, ''they can still drop into conversation that they spent all afternoon someplace chic.''
 As for Ms. Wright? She's not going on a fancy summer vacation this year, but she did just buy a brand-new Audi A5.
 See-and-be-seen nightclubs are jammed, even as people cut back by eating at home, making many restaurants deadly quiet. (MyHouse, a new 700-person club designed like the interior of a Hollywood Hills mansion, is selling out four nights a week. On a recent night you could shoot a cannon though Ketchup, a fashionable eatery on Sunset Boulevard.) Carwashes are still busy, though car sales have plummeted. Tanning salons? You better have an appointment.
 And don't mess with the hair. At Chris McMillan Salon, best known as home base for Jennifer Aniston's locks, the scissors are flying faster than ever after a bumpy adjustment period when clients -- men in particular -- started coming in every six weeks instead of every four.
 ''People whine about not being able to afford that new Aston Martin, but I've been slammed lately,'' said Jason Schneidman, a stylist at the salon. He added, however, that he was selling some of his ''personal luxury items,'' like a motorcycle, to put a bid on a bigger house by the beach.
 Some people categorize image upkeep as little indulgences during difficult times. Others, of course, feel guilty about splurging, as unemployment hits double digits. California's jobless rate of 11.2 percent is the fourth-highest in the nation.
 ''Opulence doesn't seem appropriate right now,'' said Virginia Fout, whose V Productions plans affairs like Elton John's annual Oscar party.
 Even so, Ms. Fout said, ''you have a certain style you want to keep.'' That can mean spinning cheap as chic. ''Look at it as a creative challenge to update for summer at H&M instead of Balenciaga,'' she said.
 Chuck Garric, who plays bass for Alice Cooper and Billy Bob Thornton, has a challenge of his own: relearning how to parallel park after years of tossing his keys to a valet. He's still springing for meals at trendy eateries like Katsuya, where sushi rolls cost as much as $18 each. But $10 for valet parking, plus tip? 
 ''Nobody notices if you valet or if you park on the street,'' he said. (Not that he's particularly happy about self parking. ''The amount of circling you have to do is incredible,'' he observed.)
 Time-honored Hollywood traditions are shifting in this environment, perhaps none as much as the make-up gift. Hard-knuckle negotiations, a moviedom staple, are often followed by delivery of an expensive bottle of booze. The hot-headed are keeping the practice alive, but these days there's more Johnny Walker Black than Laphroaig, and the bottle is dropped off by an assistant instead of a messenger.
 ''These gifts are still going out, but people are spending less,'' said Jon Stevenson, general manager of Wally's Wine & Spirits. ''I know this because our volume isn't off nearly as much as our sales.''
 The bipolar way Hollywood is adapting to the downturn in many respects mirrors the movie business. The box office is on fire: ticket sales are up 16 percent, and attendance 13 percent, according to Hollywood.com, a box office tracking service. But studio bottom lines are barely benefiting because DVD sales have plummeted. The big studios have laid off thousands of employees.
 The simultaneous feast and famine have the industry needing to push while pulling back. Paramount Pictures, for instance, had a splashy premiere for ''Star Trek'' at Grauman's Chinese Theater two weeks ago, building a giant replica of the Starfleet emblem and rolling out thousands of yards of themed carpet for stars to traverse.
 But when the television cameras were turned off, and it was time for the after party, Paramount turned down the glamour. Aside from a 27-beam light show at the party's entrance, decorations were sparse, and the food consisted of salad and hummus, causing blog chatter that it came from Whole Foods.
 Paramount said no grocery store was involved. The original catering company got the date wrong, a Paramount spokeswoman said, and a stand-in had to be hired at the last minute.
 Spinning straw into gold has always been crucial to Hollywood, and now is no exception. The scaled-down Vanity Fair Oscar party was ''more intimate,'' not cheaper. Nate'n Al, a no-frills deli frequented for breakfast by Larry King and his cronies, is now a ''classic lunch spot.'' The rarefied Grill on the Alley, long the lunch haunt of choice for power agents? Empty booths.
 On a recent Friday, Robertson Boulevard sat starkly empty at lunchtime. The Ivy's patio, usually a frenzy of preeners nibbling on $25 hamburgers, was sedate: not a single paparazzo lurked on the sidewalk; a parking valet kicked at the curb in boredom.
 No matter. ''So your company's expense policy no longer includes grossly overpriced restaurants,'' said Jessica Morgan, fashion blogger and co-author of ''The Fug Awards,'' a book about starlet attire. ''If you act like a star in Los Angeles, people will treat you like one.''

HEADLINE: Diplomas in Latin: O Tempora! O Mores!

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''A Degree in English,'' by Christopher Francese (Op-Ed, May 15):
 The heartfelt plea by Professor Francese to lose the Latin on college diplomas is, nevertheless, the wrong thing. 
 Instead of more customer convenience services, we need to make sure that the kids can read their degrees, and then some. 
 A mere semester of Latin and one of Greek rigorously taught would not only render sheepskin Latin legible, but the courses would also give kids rudimentary tools to use, for openers, in occasional investigations of Western civilization's received wisdom. 
 While the effort won't be as easy as solving Monday crossword clues, some diligence and a dictionary-grammar first aid kit can bring key words in translations of classical texts and scripture out of the darkness. 
 And who knows, it may also stimulate other curiosities that will encourage rather than erode the development of those habits of mind that mark educated men and women. 
 Gaudeamus ... J. Ranelli
 Old Lyme, Conn., May 15, 2009
 To the Editor:
 As a former high school Latin teacher and current Latin tutor, I was dismayed to see the old lingua franca suffering yet another blow from no less than a classicist.
 Despite some good publicity from The New York Times and others in recent years, Latin remains under heavy scrutiny for its value and viability in this era of high-stakes testing and ''practical skills'' focus in public education. 
 The current economy only adds to the problem, forcing districts to make budgetary cuts. 
 Owing to its roots as a medieval institution, not a classical one, the university honors its past by using the same form of Latin that it has always used. 
 Graduation is a capstone ceremony to celebrate the work of the matriculants in this centuries-old system.
 Occasionally, people like to indulge in a little ''prestige of form'' to acknowledge this connection. Plus, the archaic calligraphy looks great in photos with cap and gown. 
 I have faith that our new graduates will not be spoiled by a little well-deserved pomp and circumstance.

HEADLINE: Toyota, Challenging Honda, Offers Its New Prius in Japan

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
Toyota Motor began selling its next-generation Prius hybrid in Japan on Monday as it seeks to reassert its clout in an increasingly crowded market for green cars.
 Toyota is counting on the revamped gas-electric vehicle to help it fend off competitors, especially Honda Motor, whose low-cost Insight hybrid has sold 19,492 units since its introduction in Japan this year. 
 The latest Prius model has a more powerful engine and rooftop solar cells that power an advanced ventilation system. Its fuel economy is 50 miles a gallon, nearly 9 percent better than the older model, according to Toyota.
 With the new Prius, Toyota, the world's biggest automaker, comes full circle after being hurt by a foray into larger, gas-guzzling vehicles like the Tundra pickup truck. Ravaged by the global slump, Toyota lost 436.94 billion yen, or $4.4 billion, in the year that ended in March, a striking reversal from its recent record profits.
 Toyota aims to sell up to 400,000 of the new Prius cars each year globally, the company's incoming president, Akio Toyoda, told reporters after driving one onto a stage at a packed Tokyo showroom. 
 ''Toyota's trying to get more of a strategic focus,'' said Chris Richter, an analyst in Tokyo at the brokerage firm CLSA. ''I think there's maybe a sense that in the rush to become bigger and bigger, they were being all things to all people by selling Tundras at the same time as Prius -- and that backfired.
 ''I think Toyota is looking to re-establish its green credentials.''
 The Prius, now in its third generation since its introduction in 1997, is the most popular hybrid, with 1.25 million vehicles sold. But the global economic slump has eaten into sales, with virtually no increase in 2008 from the previous year, as the overall auto market struggled.
 For consumers, the most attractive feature of the new Prius may be its price. In Japan, the carmaker has set a range of 2.05 million yen to 3.27 million yen (about $21,549 to $34,373), which is lower than the previous model's cost of 2.33 million yen to 3.35 million yen.
 In an unusual move, Toyota also said it would continue to sell the second-generation Prius in Japan and will reduce its price to 1.89 million yen to match the Insight. Toyota said it would cater to mostly corporate customers with the older Prius model.
 In the United States, where the new Prius will go on sale this month, the price will start at $22,000, unchanged from the base price for the previous model. Toyota is also promising a more basic American model this year starting at $21,000.
 Honda's Insight is smaller than the Prius and its price starts at $19,800.

HEADLINE: Restaurateurs Bid to Run Tavern on Green

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
It will not be Cipriani on the Green, Danny Meyer on the Green or even Commander's Palace on the Green. Glorious Food will not be served up by the caterer of that name. And another restaurateur, David Liederman, has also backed away from Tavern on the Green.
 These are some of the dining world's heavy hitters who did not submit their $50,000 certified checks to the Department of Parks and Recreation on Monday to compete for a 20-year operating license of the landmark restaurant in Central Park. 
 However, Seth Greenberg, owner of Capitale and Espace in Manhattan, said he had submitted a proposal. And Dean J. Poll, who runs the Central Park Boathouse restaurant, entered the competition, saying, ''I'm in the park, and I know just how to run Tavern.''
 Also, the current license holder, the family of the late restaurateur Warner LeRoy, will seek to maintain its control for another 20 years (the license expires Dec. 31).
 Recently some 150 potential operators took tours of the 1,000-seat Tavern, which reported $36.2 million in revenues last year.
 Mr. Greenberg, president of Sterling Group Management, said his team had put together a ''serious and ambitious'' proposal to take over Tavern, calling it ''probably the most precious restaurant in the world, given its location and prominence.''
 As for the LeRoy family, ''We've done a lot of homework to set forth the best proposal,'' said Michael Desiderio, Tavern's chief operating officer. ''We're committed to extending the brand.''
 Donald Trump did not compete. Alan N. Stillman, founder of Fourth Wall Restaurants, which includes the Smith & Wollensky chain, did not submit a proposal, ''because I'm involved in other projects currently,'' he said. 
 After the proposals were submitted, the parks department did not name the entrants, or even announce how many proposals it had received. The secrecy, said Charles Kloth, the department's director of concessions, was ''strategically necessary, since we want to get the best overall deal for the city.'' A decision is expected in July.
 Under the current contract, the LeRoy family is required to pay only 3.5 percent of Tavern's gross receipts to the city, though more recent licenses have required more than 10 percent to run parks department properties like the Boathouse, which pays 16.5 percent.
 If the proposals are unacceptable to the parks department, it has the option to extend the current license until an economic upturn. Such speculation would be ''premature,'' Adrian Benepe, the parks commissioner, said in an interview. 
 For years the restaurant, near West 67th Street, was one of the highest-grossing independently owned restaurants in the United States. But the its fortunes have declined in the recession.
 Mr. Meyer, chief executive of Union Square Hospitality Group, said in a statement that ''as passionate New Yorkers, we were excited and tempted by the opportunity to envision how to transform such a magnificent place into a new institution for our city to cherish.'' But, he said, ''the overall business opportunity unfortunately did not make sense for us at this time.''
 Cipriani ''looked into it but will not be participating,'' said Matthew Hiltzik, a spokesman, without offering reasons.
 And Sean Driscoll, a partner at Glorious Food, said his catering company ''pulled out for lots of reasons,'' declining to elaborate.
 Mr. Liederman, who formerly owned Chez Louis in Manhattan and Restaurant Luna in Mount Kisco, said, ''I ran the numbers with my accountants, and there was no way to make this work in the middle of a depression.''
 The parks department has said in its request for proposals that ''the incoming concessionaire shall retain existing employees by seniority within each job classification.'' John Turchiano, a spokesman for the union representing Tavern's workers, Local 6 of Unite Here, said it had expressed its concerns to the parks department ''about the future of the employees at Tavern'' under the new license. The restaurant has 500 employees in the Christmas season and the summer and some 250 at other times.
 Mr. Liederman estimated that with revenues of more than $30 million in recent years before the recession, profits would be $3 million to $5 million under the current 3.5 percent licensing fee.
 ''If the fee goes up to where the Boathouse is at 16.5 percent,'' he added, ''that takes a big hunk of profit out of the restaurant, and the union work rules wouldn't give you enough flexibility to bring much to the bottom line.''
 Ti Adelaide Martin, co-proprietor of Commander's Palace in New Orleans, said she would focus on rebuilding her restaurant Brennan's of Houston, which was damaged by fire. But she said of the Tavern proposal, ''the expense of the renovation and operation are going to make it very complicated and risky.''

HEADLINE: Overhaul Likely For Credit Cards

BYLINE: By ANDREW MARTIN; Ron Lieber contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Credit cards have long been a very good deal for people who pay their bills on time and in full. Even as card companies imposed punitive fees and penalties on those late with their payments, the best customers racked up cash-back rewards, frequent-flier miles and other perks in recent years.
 Now Congress is moving to limit the penalties on riskier borrowers, who have become a prime source of billions of dollars in fee revenue for the industry. And to make up for lost income, the card companies are going after those people with sterling credit.
 Banks are expected to look at reviving annual fees, curtailing cash-back and other rewards programs and charging interest immediately on a purchase instead of allowing a grace period of weeks, according to bank officials and trade groups. 
 ''It will be a different business,'' said Edward L. Yingling, the chief executive of the American Bankers Association, which has been lobbying Congress for more lenient legislation on behalf of the nation's biggest banks. ''Those that manage their credit well will in some degree subsidize those that have credit problems.''
 As they thin their ranks of risky cardholders to deal with an economic downturn, major banks including American Express, Citigroup, Bank of America and a long list of others have already begun to raise interest rates, and some have set their sights on consumers who pay their bills on time. The legislation scheduled for a Senate vote on Tuesday does not cap interest rates, so banks can continue to lift them, albeit at a slower pace and with greater disclosure. 
 ''There will be one-size-fits-all pricing, and as a result, you'll see the industry will be more egalitarian in terms of its revenue base,'' said David Robertson, publisher of the Nilson Report, which tracks the credit card business. 
 People who routinely pay off their credit card balances have been enjoying the equivalent of a free ride, he said, because many have not had to pay an annual fee even as they collect points for air travel and other perks.
 ''Despite all the terrible things that have been said, you're making out like a bandit,'' he said. ''That's a third of credit card customers, 50 million people who have gotten a great deal.''
 Robert Hammer, an industry consultant, said the legislation might have the broad effect of encouraging card issuers to become ever more reliant on fees from marginal customers as well as creditworthy cardholders -- ''deadbeats'' in industry parlance, because they generate scant fee revenue. 
 ''They aren't charities. They have shareholders to report to,'' he said, referring to banks and credit card companies. ''Whatever is left in the model to work from, they will start to maneuver.''
 Banks used to give credit cards only to the best consumers and charge them a flat interest rate of about 20 percent and an annual fee. But with the relaxing of usury laws in some states, and the ready availability of credit scores in the late 1980s, banks began offering cards with a variety of different interest rates and fees, tying the pricing to the credit risk of the cardholder.
 That helped push interest rates down for many consumers, but they soared for riskier cardholders, who became a significant source of revenue for the industry. The recent economic downturn challenged that formula, and banks started dumping the riskiest customers and lowering their credit limits in earnest as the recession accelerated. Now, consumers who pay their bills off every month are issuing a rising chorus of complaints about shortened grace periods, new hidden fees and higher interest rates. 
 The industry says that the proposals will force banks to issue fewer credit cards at greater cost to the current cardholders. 
 Citigroup and Capital One referred comments to the A.B.A. Discover and American Express declined to comment. Bank of America intends to ''provide credit to the largest number of creditworthy customers possible, while also remaining prudent in our lending practices,'' said Betty Riess, a spokeswoman. Together with JPMorgan Chase, which has said the changes will force it to limit credit availability and raise fees, these banks account for 80 percent of the credit card industry. 
 Banks are not required to publicly reveal how much money they make from penalty interest rates and fees, though government officials and industry consultants estimate they constitute a growing portion of revenue.
 For instance, Mr. Hammer said the amount of money generated by penalty fees like late charges and exceeding credit limits had increased by about $1 billion annually in recent years, and should top $20 billion this year. 
 Regulations passed by the Federal Reserve in December to curb unexpected interest charges would cost issuers about $12 billion a year in lost fees and income, according to industry calculations. The legislation before Congress would build on the Fed rules and would further squeeze banks' revenue when they are being hit with a high rate of credit card charge-offs. The government's stress tests showed that the nation's 19 biggest banks will take on $82 billion in credit card losses in the next two years. 
 A 2005 report by the Government Accountability Office estimated that 70 percent of card issuers' revenue came from interest charges, and the portion from penalty rates appeared to be growing. The remainder came from fees on cardholders as well as retailers for processing transactions. Many retailers are angry at the high fees and plan to pass them on to shoppers once the Congressional legislation takes effect. 
 Consumer advocates say they have little sympathy for credit card issuers, arguing that they have made billions in recent years with unfair and sometimes deceptive practices. 
 ''The business model will change because the business model doesn't work for the public,'' said Gail Hillebrand, a senior lawyer at Consumers Union. 
 ''In order to do business under the new rules, they'll actually have to tell you how much it's going to cost,'' she said. 
 With many consumers mired in debt and angry at what they consider gouging by credit card companies, the issue of credit card reform has broad populist appeal. Members of Congress and the Obama administration have seized on the discontent to push reforms that the industry succeeded in tamping down when the economy was flying high. 
 Austan Goolsbee, an economic adviser to President Obama, said that while the credit card industry had the right to make a reasonable profit as long as its contracts were in plain language and rule-breakers were held accountable, its current practices were akin to ''a series of carjackings.''
 ''The card industry is giving the argument that if you didn't want to be carjacked, why weren't you locking your doors or taking a different road?'' Mr. Goolsbee said.

HEADLINE: Lawmakers' Raise Is in Voters' Hands

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
On Tuesday, voters in California are likely to do what many citizens all over the country would probably love to do: put the brakes on pay increases for elected state officials.
 But policy experts question whether limiting the salaries of lawmakers, particularly allowing voters to do so, is a good idea.
 It is easy to understand the appeal, especially in California, which has the highest-paid legislature in the country (members earn more than $116,000 a year, with $173 for daily expenses) and whose budget is in crisis. Why reward those who seem responsible for the problems? 
 On the ballot is a measure, Proposition 1F, that would bar the state commission that sets salaries for the governor and state legislators from increasing those salaries when there is a budget deficit, as there is now. Proposition 1F is one of six measures intended to address the budget chaos; polls suggest that Proposition 1F may be the only one that passes.
 ''One-F is a no-brainer,'' said Mark DiCamillo, director of the state's respected Field Poll, an independent, nonpartisan research organization. ''I would go to the bank with that one.'' 
 But critics say that although the impulse to deny lawmakers a raise in any state is natural, especially considering that most get generous pensions, doing so could have negative consequences.
 ''It's as American as apple pie, and deeply destructive,'' said John D. Donahue, a lecturer in public policy at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard who has studied public- and private-sector compensation. 
 The salaries of legislators in many states are already below the per capita income of their residents, according to various studies. Critics argue that low salaries can make legislators vulnerable to special interests and keep qualified people from running. 
 But when voters have a say in the salaries, they rarely give raises, especially in hard times, when states are laying off workers, cutting services and raising taxes. If Proposition 1F is successful in California, it could be replicated elsewhere.
 In New York, State Senator Eric Adams, a Democrat from Brooklyn, said he liked the idea of limiting pay raises during deficits. Two years ago as a freshman, when the state was on firmer financial footing, he declared publicly that New York legislators deserved a pay increase. (He easily won re-election anyway.) New York legislators, who meet part time and can hold full-time outside jobs, have not had a pay increase in 10 years. Their base pay is $79,500 a year, with about $160 a day for expenses.. 
 ''If there's a deficit, we should not be rewarded,'' Mr. Adams said in an interview last week. He then modified that view, saying that if the deficit is big -- the latest $20 billion gap was the biggest in New York's history -- then legislators should not get a raise, but if it is smaller (say, $5 billion), they should. 
 In 2008, elected officials in 17 states received salary increases, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. In most of those states, salaries are tied to an index and increase automatically when the cost of living goes up, or a commission decides.
 States in which voters have some say in the salaries are the least likely to see raises. 
 In Arizona, for example, voters have voted ''no'' on a pay increase in every election since 1998, when they last raised the pay, to $24,000 from $15,000. 
 ''Putting legislative compensation into the hands of voters could ultimately make it even more difficult for legislators to receive a fair compensation,'' said Morgan Cullen, a policy specialist with the state legislatures conference.
 Legislators typically go years without a raise, Mr. Cullen said, then try for a substantial one. Invariably, he said, ''it will get a lot of bad press and ultimately fail because politically it's not worth the effort to fight for it.''
 This was the case in Louisiana, where lawmakers, who meet part time, have not had a raise since 1980. They voted last year to more than double their salary, to $37,500 from $16,800, with more for expenses. Gov. Bobby Jindal was pressured by an outraged public to veto it. 
 In New Hampshire, which has the lowest-paid legislature in the country and where the concept of a part-time citizen legislature is still alive, the salary -- $100 a year -- is set in the State Constitution. 
 Because of the inherent difficulties in raising legislative pay, the salaries in 28 states dropped, when adjusted for inflation, in the three decades from 1975 to 2005, according to an analysis released in 2007 by the Council of State Governments. In the states where salaries increased, they did not keep up with inflation.
 In New York, for example, per capita income rose almost 57 percent over those three decades, yet legislative salaries fell by almost 9 percent, when adjusted for inflation, according to the analysis. 
 California, on the other hand, is one of the few states where legislative salaries not only rose, by 41.8 percent, in the period but kept pace with the rise in per capita income, 40.4 percent. 
 The perception in California of lawmakers as fat cats not doing their job has added to voter furor, with the Field Poll finding approval of the legislature at an all-time low of 14 percent. Mr. DiCamillo, director of the poll, said voters especially resented that Sacramento had tossed its budget decisions to them.
 ''They're just trying to strike back in whatever way they can at the legislature,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Geithner Says He Favors New Policies, Not Pay Caps

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said on Monday that the government should not impose caps on executive pay at institutions that receive federal bailouts, but instead should set policies that discourage all financial companies from rewarding excessive risk-taking. 
 ''I don't think our government should set caps on compensation,'' he said at an event hosted by Newsweek. Treasury officials are drafting regulations reflecting a measure passed by Congress in February that bans bonuses and certain other pay incentives for top executives at firms receiving federal aid.
 Instead of caps, Mr. Geithner said, ''I think we can bring about broader reforms of compensation incentives in finance as a whole,'' not just at companies in the Troubled Asset Relief Program. ''We'll make it much less likely that people get paid to take large amounts of short-term risk at the expense of their firm and the system as a whole.''
 The Treasury plans to propose within weeks an overhaul of the government's financial regulatory system. Some lawmakers have begun complaining privately that Treasury is not moving fast enough, and that it risks squandering the leverage that the crisis gives the government over the financial industry. 
 But Mr. Geithner signaled that he was mindful of the moment. ''You want to move at the point where people still have the memory of the trauma,'' he said.
 Mr. Geithner also said that administration officials were ''in close touch'' with officials in California -- where fiscal woes have spawned talk that the state soon may need a bailout -- and with officials in other states and cities hit hard by the recession and the crisis in the municipal bond market. But he dismissed a question about the likelihood of federal bailouts, saying, ''I wouldn't use the word 'bailout' or 'federal.' ''
 Asked how he felt about the possibility of leaving a ballooning federal debt to his two children, Mr. Geithner said that for now, deficit reduction had to take a back seat.

HEADLINE: Take the War to the Drug Lords

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN PETERS. 
Gretchen Peters is the author of ''Seeds of Terror: How Heroin Is Bankrolling the Taliban and Al Qaeda.''

 BODY:
A SKINNY man opened the gate at the sprawling compound in Quetta, in western Pakistan. When I asked if the property belonged to Afghanistan's most powerful drug smuggler, he smiled and nodded. ''Haji Juma Khan has 200 houses,'' he said. ''And this is one of them.'' 
 I had been trying to track down Mr. Khan for years when I found this residence on a dusty, garbage-strewn alley. It hardly seemed an auspicious address for a man who American officials say moved as much as $1 billion worth of opium every year, hiring the Taliban to protect his colossal narcotics shipments and paying corrupt officials in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran to look the other way. 
 I said I was a journalist and wanted to interview the boss. ''He is on the run and we have not seen him,'' said another man, who introduced himself as Mr. Khan's clerk. ''But please come inside and have a cup of tea.'' 
 Even with the top man on the run, Mr. Khan's network ran a string of heroin labs in the mountainous area where the borders of Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran merge. He had built huge underground storage bunkers in remote deserts for his product. He came to the attention of Western law enforcement officials for sending drug convoys made up of dozens of S.U.V.'s packed with narcotics, which were then unloaded onto ships along Pakistan's southern coast. 
 Last October, about three months after I drank tea with his colleagues in Quetta, Mr. Khan was arrested and extradited to the United States. He is now jailed at New York City's Metropolitan Correctional Center, awaiting trial on charges of conspiracy to distribute narcotics with intent to support a terrorist organization. His capture was a major, if little noticed, victory in the war on drugs in Afghanistan, although my contacts in Quetta tell me his relatives are keeping the network going strong.
 Studying Mr. Khan's operations allowed me to understand the challenges of fighting Afghanistan's opium trade, which at once benefits the Taliban, Al Qaeda and corrupt officials in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran. It also provided some insight on how to reshape our counternarcotics strategy.
 So far, Western-led efforts to fight the opium trade in Afghanistan have focused mainly on eradicating poppy crops, a policy that has done little to hamper the drug lords and simply victimized poppy farmers and poor sharecroppers who work the land. As the Obama administration overhauls strategy in Afghanistan, installing Lt. Gen. Stanley McChrystal as the top commander, the focus of antidrug efforts should be on the smugglers and drug processors. 
 First, there must be stepped-up efforts to take down powerful traffickers like Mr. Khan and to cut off the Taliban's opium profits, which the United Nations calculates to be worth $400 million a year. Their greatest earnings don't come at the farming level, but from protecting shipments leaving farm areas and taxing drug refineries.
 A good start would be using air attacks to destroy drug convoys carrying opium on smuggling trails toward the Pakistani border, using the same infrared technology employed along the Mexican border to avoid hitting civilian vehicles. Working with local law enforcement, NATO forces must also establish checkpoints along major arteries and border crossings and search all vehicles for drugs -- even those belonging to senior Afghan government officials and their relatives. Taliban warriors may be able to slip over the mountainous borders in secret, but large drug shipments often go by road. 
 In October, NATO gave its commanders a mandate to destroy drug refineries, but many have been reluctant to do so. Not only should they take the offensive, but they should put an emphasis on arresting the chemists and other specialists operating the labs, who are difficult to replace. Some NATO nations in the Afghan coalition have placed restrictions on their troops that prevent them from participating in American-led counternarcotics operations. That's short-sighted, given that Afghan heroin tends to end up on European streets. Until such restrictions are dropped, troops from those nations should be deployed to provide security, freeing up American and Afghan soldiers for combat linked to the opium trade.
 In addition, until Afghanistan's notoriously weak judiciary and police can be reformed, we should bring any major smugglers to the United States for trial, as was done with Mr. Khan. 
 Afghanistan's drug problem extends beyond its borders. While Pakistan seems finally to be taking the fight to the Taliban elements in its northwestern frontier areas, it must simultaneously round up leaders of powerful cartels that operate from Baluchistan province in the southwest. These men supply insurgents with money, vehicles, communications equipment and weapons. Some even run guesthouses and hospitals that treat wounded Taliban soldiers. One alleged kingpin, Sakhi Dost Muhammad Notezai, has been wanted by American authorities since the late 1980s. Yet, despite evidence that his clan is still tied to smuggling opium, his son is the transportation minister for Baluchistan. 
 Stopping the drug flow is only half the battle: the money flows along separate routes from the opium, and disrupting financial flows may be tougher. To that end, Washington should subsidize efforts to regulate both Afghanistan's bank transfers and the informal hawala network, the subcontinent's unregulated version of the Western Union. Most hawala transfers are legitimate -- Western aid groups in Afghanistan, for example, use it to send funds to rural field offices. But the system also moves drug money. The Treasury Department has put together a sound proposal that would not add costs for those using the hawala system but would allow the authorities to track who sent how much money, and to whom. 
 In the end, no counternarcotics program will make a difference in the war if Afghanistan and Pakistan fail to improve their governance. The Taliban are gaining ground not because they are well liked (they aren't, in either place) but because the governments in both countries are seen as incompetent and corrupt. Many experts believe that corrupt officials on both sides of the border earn even more off the drug trade than the Taliban do. 
 As the Taliban and Al Qaeda become intertwined with smugglers like Haji Juma Khan, they swell in economic and military might. And then a drug problem that began as a regional headache becomes a global security nightmare: a two-headed monster of criminal smugglers and rich terrorist groups with deadly global ambitions.

HEADLINE: Work Time and Sick Days

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Do Everybody a Favor: Take a Sick Day'' (Cases, May 12): If only the reason workers come to work sick is that they're too self-important, self-absorbed, thoughtless or macho to stay home. If only. 
 The sad fact is that nearly half of private-sector workers in this country, and three in four low-wage workers, don't have a single paid sick day. For them, staying home to recover means losing a paycheck and possibly their job. In this economy, that's not a risk most of us can take.
 The Healthy Families Act will be introduced in Congress this week. This modest bill would let workers earn up to seven paid sick days a year. Until it becomes law, let's refrain from scolding those who come to work when they're sick. Debra L. Ness

HEADLINE: Message in What We Buy, But Nobody's Listening

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
Why does a diploma from Harvard cost $100,000 more than a similar piece of paper from City College? Why might a BMW cost $25,000 more than a Subaru WRX with equally fast acceleration? Why do ''sophisticated'' consumers demand 16-gigabyte iPhones and ''fair trade'' coffee from Starbucks? 
 If you ask market researchers or advertising executives, you might hear about the difference between ''rational'' and ''emotional'' buying decisions, or about products falling into categories like ''hedonic'' or ''utilitarian'' or ''positional.'' But Geoffrey Miller, an evolutionary psychologist at the University of New Mexico, says that even the slickest minds on Madison Avenue are still in the prescientific dark ages. 
 Instead of running focus groups and spinning theories, he says, marketers could learn more by administering scientifically calibrated tests of intelligence and personality traits. If marketers (or their customers) understood biologists' new calculations about animals' ''costly signaling,'' Dr. Miller says, they'd see that Harvard diplomas and iPhones send the same kind of signal as the ornate tail of a peacock. 
 Sometimes the message is as simple as ''I've got resources to burn,'' the classic conspicuous waste demonstrated by the energy expended to lift a peacock's tail or the fuel guzzled by a Hummer. But brand-name products aren't just about flaunting transient wealth. The audience for our signals -- prospective mates, friends, rivals -- care more about the permanent traits measured in tests of intelligence and personality, as Dr. Miller explains in his new book, ''Spent: Sex, Evolution and Consumer Behavior.''
 Suppose, during a date, you casually say, ''The sugar maples in Harvard Yard were so beautiful every fall term.'' Here's what you're signaling, as translated by Dr. Miller: 
 ''My S.A.T. scores were sufficiently high (roughly 720 out of 800) that I could get admitted, so my I.Q. is above 135, and I had sufficient conscientiousness, emotional stability and intellectual openness to pass my classes. Plus, I can recognize a tree.''
 Or suppose a young man, after listening to the specifications of the newest iPhone or hearing about a BMW's ''Servotronic variable-ratio power steering,'' says to himself, ''Those features sound awesome.'' Here's Dr. Miller's translation: 
 ''Those features can be talked about in ways that will display my general intelligence to potential mates and friends, who will bow down before my godlike technopowers, which rival those of Iron Man himself.''
 Most of us will insist there are other reasons for going to Harvard or buying a BMW or an iPhone -- and there are, of course. The education and the products can yield many kinds of rewards. But Dr. Miller says that much of the pleasure we derive from products stems from the unconscious instinct that they will either enhance or signal our fitness by demonstrating intelligence or some of the Big Five personality traits: openness, conscientiousness, agreeableness, stability and extraversion.
 In a series of experiments, Dr. Miller and other researchers found that people were more likely to expend money and effort on products and activities if they were first primed with photographs of the opposite sex or stories about dating. 
 After this priming, men were more willing to splurge on designer sunglasses, expensive watches and European vacations. Women became more willing to do volunteer work and perform other acts of conspicuous charity -- a signal of high conscientiousness and agreeableness, like demonstrating your concern for third world farmers by spending extra for Starbucks's ''fair trade'' coffee. 
 These signals can be finely nuanced, as Dr. Miller parses them in his book. The ''conspicuous precision'' of a BMW or a Lexus helps signal the intelligence of all the owners, but the BMW's ''conspicuous reputation'' also marks its owner as more extraverted and less agreeable (i.e., more aggressive). Owners of Toyotas and Hondas are signaling high conscientiousness by driving reliable and economical cars. 
 But once you've spent the money, once you've got the personality-appropriate appliance or watch or handbag, how much good are these signals actually doing you? Not much, Dr. Miller says. The fundamental consumerist delusion, as he calls it, is that purchases affect the way we're treated. 
 The grand edifice of brand-name consumerism rests on the narcissistic fantasy that everyone else cares about what we buy. (It's no accident that narcissistic teenagers are the most brand-obsessed consumers.) But who else even notices? Can you remember what your partner or your best friend was wearing the day before yesterday? Or what kind of watch your boss has?
 A Harvard diploma might help get you a date or a job interview, but what you say during the date or conversation will make the difference. An elegantly thin Skagen watch might send a signal to a stranger at a cocktail party or in an airport lounge, but even if it were noticed, anyone who talked to you for just a few minutes would get a much better gauge of your intelligence and personality. 
 To get over your consuming obsessions, Dr. Miller suggests exercises like comparing the relative costs and pleasures of the stuff you've bought. (You can try the exercise at nytimes.com/tierneylab.) It may seem odd that we need these exercises -- why would natural selection leave us with such unproductive fetishes? -- but Dr. Miller says it's not surprising.
 ''Evolution is good at getting us to avoid death, desperation and celibacy, but it's not that good at getting us to feel happy,'' he says, calling our desire to impress strangers a quirky evolutionary byproduct of a smaller social world.
 ''We evolved as social primates who hardly ever encountered strangers in prehistory,'' Dr. Miller says. ''So we instinctively treat all strangers as if they're potential mates or friends or enemies. But your happiness and survival today don't depend on your relationships with strangers. It doesn't matter whether you get a nanosecond of deference from a shopkeeper or a stranger in an airport.''

HEADLINE: India's Challenges

 BODY:
The Indian National Congress party cannot afford a prolonged celebration after its overwhelming election victory. Much of the postvote analysis has focused on the daunting domestic agenda. But now that Congress has a stable mandate -- and can shuck a fractious coalition -- it is time for India to exercise the kind of regional and global leadership expected of a rising power. 
 It can start with neighboring Pakistan, arguably the most dangerous country on earth. A report in The Times on Monday reminds us just how dangerous: The United States believes Islamabad is rapidly expanding a nuclear arsenal thought to already contain 80 to 100 weapons.
 We have consistently supported appropriate military aid and increased economic aid to help Pakistan fight the Taliban and Al Qaeda, strengthen democratic institutions and improve the life of its people. Squandering precious resources on nuclear bombs is disgraceful when Pakistan is troubled by economic crisis and facing an insurgency that threatens its very existence.
 Trying to keep up to 100 bombs from extremists is hard enough; expanding the nuclear stockpile makes the challenge worse. Officials in Washington are legitimately asking whether billions of dollars in proposed new assistance might be diverted to Pakistan's nuclear program. They should demand assurances it will not be. 
 India is essential to what Pakistan will do. New Delhi exercised welcome restraint when it did not attack Pakistan after the November 2008 attacks in Mumbai by Pakistani-based extremists. But tensions remain high, and the Pakistani Army continues to view India as its main adversary. India should take the lead in initiating arms control talks with Pakistan and China. It should also declare its intention to stop producing nuclear weapons fuel, even before a proposed multinational treaty is negotiated. That would provide leverage for Washington and others to exhort Pakistan to do the same.
 It is past time for India -- stronger both economically and in international stature -- to find a way to resolve tensions with Pakistan over Kashmir. If that festering sore cannot be addressed directly, then -- as Stephen P. Cohen, a South Asia expert at the Brookings Institution, suggests -- broader regional talks on environmental and water issues might be an interim way to find common ground. Ignoring Kashmir is no longer an option.
 India has played a constructive role in helping rebuild Afghanistan, but it must take steps to allay Islamabad's concerns that this is a plan to encircle Pakistan. It should foster regional trade with Pakistan and Afghanistan. More broadly, India must help to revive world trade talks by opening its markets. It could use its considerable trade clout with Iran, Sudan and Myanmar to curb Tehran's nuclear program, end the genocide in Darfur and press Myanmar's junta to expand human rights.
 India is the dominant power in South Asia, but it has been hesitant to assume its responsibilities. The Congress Party has to do better -- starting with Pakistan.

HEADLINE: Wall St. Firm Draws Scrutiny as U.S. Adviser

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON and MICHAEL J. de la MERCED; Edmund L. Andrews contributed reporting, and Kitty Bennett contributed research.

 BODY:
The financial crisis has ravaged many a Wall Street giant, but it has also produced a handful of winners. BlackRock, a money manager that is much admired but little known outside financial circles, is fast emerging as one of the nation's financial powerhouses. 
 BlackRock, which started in a one-room office 21 years ago, now manages $1.3 trillion in assets for big private clients, including hedge funds and foreign governments. 
 But it is the company's highly prized role as a government adviser and contractor that is now drawing attention.
 By dint of its expertise and track record, it has won contracts to help the government manage the complex rescues of Bear Stearns, the American International Group and Citigroup. 
 It also won a bid to carry out a Federal Reserve program to stimulate the moribund housing market, and it has been hired to help evaluate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-created mortgage finance giants. 
 Other firms have been hired by the government to assist with the bailout, illustrating the increasingly symbiotic relationship between Washington and Wall Street. 
 It makes sense for the government to turn to financial experts for help, but BlackRock has become so ubiquitous that some lawmakers, federal auditors and watchdog groups are now asking if the firm does too much, and if its roles as government adviser, giant federal contractor and private money manager will inevitably collide.
 Can a company that is being paid to price and sell troubled assets for the government buy the same kinds of assets for private clients without showing preference? And should the government seek counsel from a company whose clients stand to make or lose billions if those policies are enacted?
 ''They have access to information when the Federal Reserve will try to sell securities, and what price they will accept. And they have intricate financial relations with people across the globe,'' Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, said. ''The potential for a conflict of interest is great and it is just very difficult to police.'' 
 Without naming BlackRock, federal auditors have warned that any private parties that purchase distressed assets on the government's behalf could use generous federal subsidies to overpay, artificially pushing up the price of similar assets that they manage for their own portfolios.
 ''In other words, the conflict results in an enormous profit for the fund manager at the expense of the taxpayer,'' Neil M. Barofsky, the special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, wrote in a report last month.
 Some of BlackRock's advice to the government has in fact helped the company. For example, in its role as an informal adviser, it urged the Fed to intervene in the markets in a way that made investors feel it was safe to put money back into money market funds, including BlackRock's. 
 The Federal Reserve will not reveal what it is paying BlackRock, disclosing only that on one of its five contracts, it will pay at least $71 million over three years to BlackRock and other firms to manage a portfolio of mortgage assets once owned by Bear Stearns. BlackRock says that rate is discounted and that the fees it collects on bailout-related work are only a tiny portion of its overall revenue. 
 BlackRock has many admirers for the range and the quality of services it has provided to the federal government. James R. Wilkinson, who served until January as the chief of staff to the former Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., described BlackRock's co-founder and chief executive, Laurence D. Fink, as a ''patriot.''
 He added, ''He is willing to help our country when we need it most.''
 Mr. Fink said he was proud that his company was helping pull the economy back from the brink, and he bristled at the suggestion of impropriety. 
 Treasury and Fed officials have begun to take precautions. BlackRock's dominance has prompted the Fed to seek an alternative partner as it prepares to expand its rescue efforts, a government official close to the situation said, requesting anonymity because the actions could affect the market. 
 And Treasury is holding off announcing the winning bidders for perhaps the most anticipated of all the bailout programs -- the $1 trillion federally subsidized plan to purchase troubled assets from banks -- in part to make sure the bidders cannot game the system. BlackRock is widely expected to win one of the contracts, in which the government would be a partner with private firms.
 Andrew Williams, a Treasury Department spokesman, said that BlackRock had no special status and was among a large group of industry players consulted about bailout programs. 
 ''We take this very seriously,'' Mr. Williams said. ''We talk to a lot of people -- as we should.'' 
 Now 47 percent owned by Bank of America, BlackRock offers traditional services like managing other people's money. But the unit that has grabbed most of the attention lately is BlackRock Solutions, whose sophisticated software, fine-tuned over many years, can take apart the thousands of loans in a mortgage-backed security to estimate what it is now worth and what it will most likely be worth in the future, helping investors decide whether to hold or sell the asset. 
 During one frantic weekend in March 2008, when Bear Stearns was collapsing, BlackRock's omnipresence became evident.
 On a Saturday, the firm was hired by JPMorgan Chase -- which was considering buying Bear Stearns -- to value one type of Bear Stearns security. 
 The next day the Federal Reserve hired BlackRock, through a no-bid contract, to analyze and eventually sell off a $30 billion pool of risky mortgage securities that JPMorgan did not want.
 Those multiple roles created the potential for conflict, BlackRock's own executives acknowledge. The company would be trying to sell assets on behalf of the government that were similar to assets it buys and sells for thousands of other private investors.
 For example, if BlackRock Solutions signaled to BlackRock's asset managers the timing of a planned sale, that could benefit BlackRock's investors, but harm taxpayers and the Federal Reserve.
 ''We were very sensitive to it,'' said Mark Wiedman, a managing director at BlackRock Solutions.
 To avoid this, BlackRock Solutions and BlackRock asset management employees are housed in separate buildings, working on separate computer networks. The firm also sells the Bear Stearns securities only through an independent broker, meaning BlackRock does not know who the buyers are. The Fed, in addition, has prohibited BlackRock from knowingly buying any of the Fed-controlled assets. 
 But some remain skeptical that such firewalls really protect taxpayers.
 ''How can one company have so much control over the process?'' said Scott Amey, general counsel at the Project on Government Oversight, a Washington-based non-profit group. ''Isn't there somebody else they can turn to?''
 The concerns about BlackRock also extend to its role as an informal adviser. Mr. Fink has been known to call Treasury officials several times a day, Bush and Obama administration officials said, between occasional visits. 
 Last fall Mr. Fink urged the Fed to take action to unlock the frozen market for short-term lending to companies -- a business that BlackRock's money market mutual funds played a major role in. Investors had withdrawn $48 billion from those BlackRock funds, but once the Fed adopted the policy Mr. Fink was advocating, the money came pouring back. 
 Mr. Fink said his advice was forthe good of the economy, and that his was one of many industry voices calling for such a move.
 Still, Mr. Fink has not been shy in boasting about his access. ''I mean it is a great seal of approval,'' Mr. Fink told Wall Street analysts in December, as he simultaneously coached the Bush administration and the incoming Obama team. ''We are asked to help navigate new policy. I'm running out of here to go meet with Treasury to talk about plans later this afternoon.''
 But it is clear that the income from fees is a lesser benefit than the buffing of its global reputation, a point Mr. Fink has made. ''It gives comfort to our clients that we are being involved in some of the solutions of our economy, and it allows us to show our clients that we are being asked in these difficult situations to provide advice,'' he said at the same event. 
 BlackRock has not been immune to market turmoil, but its stock over the last year has held up better than its peers'. While BlackRock's share price tumbled 33 percent, Federated Investors shares have lost 34 percent and Legg Mason, 65 percent. BlackRock ended 2008, a disastrous year for Wall Street, with $786 million in profit on $5 billion in revenue.
 Some lawmakers remain wary, even though they cannot cite any specific impropriety. ''The very nature of what we are asking them to do almost guarantees that it is going to be to the benefit of BlackRock,'' said Representative Darrell Issa of California, the ranking Republican on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. ''You can have separate pews, but if you go to the same church, it will cross over.''

Investors in India, exuberant over the ruling party's commanding win in the country's monthlong election, sent stocks rocketing Monday -- so fast and so far that they forced the temporary shutdown of Indian stock exchanges. 
 The party on Dalal Street in Mumbai, home of the Bombay Stock Exchange, was proof of just how much Indian business interests regarded the Congress Party's surprisingly decisive victory as its own. 
 But the celebration could prove short-lived.
 With the Congress Party and its strongest allies just 10 seats shy of an outright majority, executives and economists predicted the party's mandate would lead to nothing less than the narrowing of China's economic lead over India. 
 The new government, they said, would usher in major reforms -- reducing the country's stifling bureaucracy, updating its creaky infrastructure and outdated labor laws, and reducing the barriers to foreign investment. All of these handicaps have left India far behind China. 
 Congress's mandate could ''herald a paradigm shift,'' said Tushar Poddar, an economist with Goldman Sachs in India, because the new government will have a much broader mandate than any in recent history. 
 The ruling party's left-leaning allies in the previous coalition government worked to limit foreign investment and repel overseas influence in business and politics. For example, they helped prevent chain stores like Wal-Mart from setting up retail stores here, agitated against a nuclear deal with the United States and tried to limit privatization of state-run industries. 
 All the Indian National Congress party needs to do to form a government is stitch up alliances with a handful of independents and small parties to reach the 272-seat majority in Parliament.
 But the euphoria of investors and analysts belied the Congress Party's own spotty recent history when it comes to solving the problems that continue to plague India. 
 The party is widely credited with bringing free market reforms to India in 1991, when Manmohan Singh, an economist who was then the finance minister, scrapped the quotas and government monopolies that made up India's ''license Raj,'' opening the country's industry to private investors and foreign cash.
 Mr. Singh, now prime minister, was responsible for ''liberalizing the economy both within the country and opening it up to foreign investment and competition,'' said Jaideep Prabhu, the Jawaharlal Nehru professor of Indian business and enterprise at the Judge Business School of Cambridge. 
 But Congress and its allies have been unable to effectively fight poverty and malnutrition, establish a comprehensive energy policy or orchestrate the sort of infrastructure projects that India sorely needs. 
 That did not stop executives and investors from predicting a new era for Indian business. The rupee strengthened Monday to its highest rate all year against the dollar, and stock markets hit curbs intended to prevent wild trading swings in just seconds. 
 The Bombay Stock Exchange's Sensex index rose over 10 percent as trading opened to 13,479 points, setting off circuit breakers, while the National Stock Exchange's Nifty rose 14.5 percent to 4,203. The Bombay exchange was closed for two hours, but when it resumed trading, the Sensex extended its gains to more than 17 percent, which set off a circuit breaker that halted trade for the rest of the day. The Sensex closed at 14,284.2 points, up 47 percent since the beginning of the year. 
 Morgan Stanley analysts raised their year-end Sensex target Monday to 15,300 points and said they expected Indian equities to outperform those of other emerging markets over the next 12 months. 
 Business owners anticipate widespread changes. ''The people of India have given a decisive and clear mandate for continuity, stability and economic growth,'' said Pawan Munjal, managing director and chief executive of Hero Honda Motors, India's largest motorcycle maker. ''This mandate will strengthen the hand of the central government to unlock long-awaited reforms.'' 
 Mr. Munjal said government spending on infrastructure would help industries like cement, steel and aluminum, while lifting employment at a critical time when many big corporations have been cutting workers. 
 Many expect a sweeping overhaul of India's energy policy. Power failures force many business owners to supply their own electricity for hours at a time, adding to costs and stifling productivity. 
 The gap between electricity demand and supply is as much as 15 percent during peak use hours, and is ''increasing day by day,'' said V. P. S. Chauhan, the chief executive of Kalpan Hydro, a hydroelectric power company.
 Mr. Chauhan said Congress needed to streamline the process by which clearances to build new plants are granted.
 Others are hoping for faster completion of infrastructure projects like roads and ports, which are often chronically delayed.
 ''One of the ways that India has been hampered relative to China has been the lack of infrastructure,'' said Wilbur L. Ross, chairman and chief executive of W.L. Ross, an investment company that has put money into airlines and textile manufacturing in India. Congress may move to privatize more infrastructure projects, he said, which could spur more growth in manufacturing, balancing the country's service-heavy export economy.
 Executives and analysts say the problem is rarely a lack of money. Instead, projects are typically behind schedule because of lengthy approval processes, shoddy design work and corruption. 
 ''The plans have started to look big now,'' said Sunil Mittal, chairman of Bharti Enterprises, a conglomerate that controls the nation's biggest cellphone company, Airtel. ''But the last piece is implementation. That's where we are struggling.'' 
 The Congress Party, while celebrating its victory, has been trying to temper expectations. Kamal Nath, the current minister of commerce, cautioned specifically against expecting liberalization in the country's financial sector. 
 In the face of the global financial crisis, India's immediate priority would be to improve domestic demand and investment, he said in an interview Monday. 
 India is unlikely to throw open the doors to foreign banks anytime soon, he said, adding triumphantly that the tightly regulated Indian banking sector had remained largely insulated from the global downturn. 
 ''As far as financial reform is concerned, we will have to be cautious looking at experience of the big financial icons of the Western world,'' he said. ''In the U.S., we are seeing government giving money to banks. In India, banks are giving money to government.'' 
 The government is more likely than ever to advance ''governance reforms,'' he said, without specifying whether that meant streamlining government administrative services, fixing a dysfunctional police and legal system, or curbing corruption in government or business. 
 Many in corporate India say the country's most pressing need is to fix the state itself, making a vast and often corrupt polity and bureaucracy more efficient and accountable. 
 ''More important than economic reform today is state reform, administrative reform, police reform, bureaucratic reform,'' said Gurcharan Das, an author who once headed Procter & Gamble's Indian operation. ''I don't see anybody among the politicians come out and say, 'I will make sure that teachers show up to work, and I will make sure the policeman doesn't come harass you.''' 
 Indeed, the rhetoric during the election campaign --from all sides -- revolved around promises to protect Indians from the vicissitudes of the global economy, not to advance India's place in it.

 From Andrew C. Revkin's blog, nytimes.com/dotearth.
 President Obama's commencement speech at Arizona State University last week was traditional fare, brimming with encouragement about pursuing public service and helping propel a new ''green revolution.'' 
 Swallowed up in the audience were 13 students representing the first class of degree recipients from the university's School of Sustainability (one student received her degree last fall). The program, created in 2006, is the first in the country to offer degrees in this multidisciplinary field, combining environmental, economic and social policy. They're part of what I've been calling Generation E, (generally) young people committed to shaping human endeavors in ways that smooth the path toward a stable, prospering population.
 The School of Sustainability has 55 graduate students and more than 300 undergraduate majors. The mission of the program, officials say, is to ''train a new generation of scholars and practitioners, and develop practical solutions to some of the most pressing environmental, economic and social challenges of sustainability, especially as they relate to urban areas.''
 The New Old Age
 Anne C. Roark posted at nytimes.com/newoldage.
 Jackson Hughes, a scientific software developer in Georgia, decided nearly 10 years ago that it was time his grandparents learned to use e-mail. He got together with his business partner, Ali Syed, to design an e-mail system no senior could resist: no log-ins or links, no ad boxes or news flashes, no pokes or Twitters -- only personal e-mail messages and photographs, with a caregiver making sure that everything is running smoothly.
 They named it PawPawMail and created a Web site, pawpawmail.com. Anyone can use the software for $5 a month and run it on virtually any PC or Mac, including old clunkers gathering dust in the back of closets.
 E-mail can be a touchy subject not only for seniors who have never tried it but also for those who are old hands. If some of my recent e-mail is any indication, many older people can get testy when someone younger assumes they don't use e-mail. And when it comes to their contemporaries, older people who do use e-mail pity those who don't.
 Well
 Owen Jennings, a guest contributor, posted on nytimes.com/well:
 My liver failed two springs ago, when I was a senior in high school. I don't know the cause of my liver disease, but one of the many rules of my long recovery has been no alcohol. Not one drink. Not even a sip.
 It was with this compulsory sobriety that I entered Dartmouth College two years ago. During my sophomore year, I pledged Alpha Delta, the fraternity that served as the model for the movie ''Animal House.'' 
 Even though no one cares that I don't drink, they still see it as bizarre. But being alcohol-free has given me an unusual vantage point for observing college life. 
 My generation has adopted drinking as a social cure-all. It's a way to fit in, and -- if you can drink enough -- it's a way to stand out.

HEADLINE: Feuding at the Central Bank

BYLINE: By PAUL TAYLOR. 
Paul Taylor is a Reuters columnist.

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
The iron discipline we have come to expect from the European Central Bank has broken down, giving an unprecedented public glimpse of feuding over the direction of monetary policy in the financial crisis.
 As the 16-nation euro zone's central bank dangles its toes in the uncharted waters of quantitative easing -- starting to buy assets in an attempt to help revive the economy -- its leaders cannot agree on how far to go and when to stop.
 As a result, Jean-Claude Trichet, the E.C.B.'s president, was able to announce only a minimal consensus on May 7, when the bank cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter-point, to 1 percent, and said it would for the first time buy 60 billion euros, or $80 billion, in covered bonds. Mr. Trichet insisted the ''enhanced credit support'' had been adopted unanimously, adding: ''We are not at all embarking on quantitative easing.'' 
 As the ensuing cacophony showed, the central bankers did not agree on whether 1 percent should be the floor for rates, on whether the bank should signal it would keep rates there for a sustained period, on how to conduct the covered bond purchase or on whether to go further in credit easing.
 Torn between the twin threats of recession and a potential return of inflation, the E.C.B. remains extremely reluctant to follow the Federal Reserve in the United States and the Bank of England in creating money on a gigantic scale to revive economic growth.
 The debate pits guardians of inflation-fighting orthodoxy -- like Axel Weber, chief of the Bundesbank in Germany, and Jurgen Stark, a member of the E.C.B.'s executive board -- against advocates of bolder monetary easing, like Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, an executive board member, and Athanasios Orphanides, governor of Cyprus's bank.
 It highlights the difficulty of building consensus and making decisions in a 22-member council -- a larger and more unwieldy body than those that set policy at the Fed and the Bank of England.
 The E.C.B.'s securities purchases will amount to just 0.6 percent of the euro zone's gross domestic product, compared with 9 percent in Britain and 12 percent in the United States.
 Clearly, some of Europe's central bankers are still more worried about the ghost of future inflation, even as price growth is poised to turn negative for some time, than about shrinking output and soaring unemployment. The euro zone economy is forecast to contract by 4 percent this year, and unemployment is projected to reach 11.5 percent of the work force in 2010.
 Yet, the inflation hawks want the E.C.B. to agree on an exit strategy from monetary easing even before starting asset purchases. Unlike the U.S. and British central banks, the E.C.B. does not publish minutes or voting records, which signal to markets the range of views and the likely direction of policy.
 So the unusual public spat among E.C.B. policy makers provides a rare insight into the depth of differences.
 Consider last week: Nout Wellink, the Dutch central bank governor, said the E.C.B. should discuss rates below 1 percent, after Mr. Weber of Germany had said on April 27 that 1 percent was ''a sensible lower limit''; Marko Kranjec of Slovenia said the E.C.B. was likely to spend more than &t;4&t;60 billion and might purchase other assets as well as covered bonds, while Ewald Nowotny of Austria said no further steps were being discussed and Mr. Weber said &t;4&t;60 billion was ''the maximum''; Lucas Papademos, the E.C.B. vice president, said there had been signs the worst was over for the economy, but Mr. Wellink retorted, ''Don't become too optimistic when you see a few swallows.''
 How long the recession is expected to last will affect the scope and the nature of measures the bank might adopt. Interest-rate cuts take 18 months to two years to have an economic effect, while asset purchases have an immediate effect. Indeed, markets have already responded before the E.C.B.'s covered bond program has begun. Yield spreads have fallen, and issuers are rushing to market in anticipation.
 Is the E.C.B.'s policy debate a sign of weakness and dithering while its U.S. and British counterparts act decisively, or is it a sign of prudence? ''We are a public council, and at the end, it's the collegial wisdom that counts,'' Mr. Stark told Reuters. ''And for this collegial wisdom to come, it is important that different arguments are brought together.''
 But when asked whether it was useful for markets to hear divergent opinions from board members, he said: ''We have a policy of one voice -- so listen to the president. That's how it is.''

HEADLINE: The Race to Provide Wi-Fi at 30,000 Feet

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY. 
E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com

 BODY:
SOME airlines are rushing to offer Wi-Fi Internet connections in their domestic aircraft cabins, but none are talking about the space squeeze.
 On an AirTran Airways Wi-Fi demonstration flight that went up and back down the Northeast seaboard from Baltimore-Washington International Airport last week, the Internet worked just fine. The problem was actually being able to use it efficiently. My laptop was wedged onto a tray table in the cramped space of a coach seat. I had to slide down in my seat just to read the screen.
 ''I have the same experience,'' said Jack W. Blumenstein, the chief executive of Aircell, the company that is providing nearly all of the Wi-Fi installations so far for domestic carriers. ''The laptop's at an angle or it's propped up almost on my nose.'' 
 ''Or I'm typing like this,'' Mr. Blumenstein said from his own coach seat on the flight. He slouched down, raised both hands and wriggled his fingers like someone scratching on a window.
 AirTran, a low-cost carrier based in Orlando, Fla., surprised the industry last week with its announcement that it would install Aircell's Gogo Inflight Internet service on its 50 Boeing 737s and 86 Boeing 717s by midsummer. Doing so would make AirTran the first domestic carrier to offer Wi-Fi on its entire fleet.
 Delta Air Lines is also speedily installing Wi-Fi. It had previously announced that it was putting the service on its entire mainline domestic fleet of more than 300 aircraft, and said the day before the AirTran demonstration that it now had the Aircell Wi-Fi system on half its planes and would have the other half converted by September.
 The rush to go Wi-Fi makes for an interesting horse race in the North American airline industry, where American Airlines, United, Virgin America and Air Canada are all installing Aircell's Gogo system.
 But there are handicaps, including the lack of electrical outlets in most coach cabins (so usage is limited by battery life), and the question of how much demand there actually is for an Internet hookup at the prices being contemplated. AirTran, for example, is charging $9.95 for flights under three hours and $12.95 for those over three hours.
 So far, said Joe Brancatelli, publisher of the business travel Web site Joesentme.com, ''there is zero proof'' that a significant number of passengers are willing to pay for in-flight Wi-Fi service on domestic routes. (The Aircell service depends on land-based cellular towers and cannot be used on overseas flights.) 
 Furthermore, he argued, those who are inclined to use Wi-Fi on a flight, including business travelers drawn by the potential for increased productivity, are exactly the people who most resist being nickel-and-dimed for services like Internet connections in a hotel -- or on a plane.
 The Gogo service costs an average of about $100,000 a plane to install, said an Aircell spokeswoman, Arianne Venuso, , who declined to give specific figures on how many people use it on planes already outfitted, like the 767s flown by American Airlines on its coast-to-coast routes. ''Usage has exceeded expectations,'' she said.
 Obviously, the airlines rushing to install Wi-Fi are banking on a viable market. In this sour economic climate, Wi-Fi is one of the few new services that domestic carriers are spending money on. 
 ''We're leapfrogging the industry getting the Internet on board, but in a short period of time, a couple of years, everybody is going to have it,'' Robert L. Fornaro, the AirTran chief executive officer, told me on the flight. ''It's too important not to have.'' 
 Mr. Blumenstein, of Aircell, pointed out that laptop users going through contortions to use the Internet -- perhaps with that seat in front of them cranked back all the way -- are not the only market for the service. Aircell and its airline partners are clearly betting on a big increase in the market for Internet-enabled smartphones.
 AirTran, for example, set a lower price, $7.95 for flights of any length, for passengers using Wi-Fi smartphones. With an iPhone or a BlackBerry enabled for Wi-Fi, that problem with tight space shrinks considerably.
 ''When we started out to build our network two summers ago, there was not a single smartphone with a Wi-Fi chip in it, not a single BlackBerry with a Wi-Fi chip. Now, if you look at the industry data, about 90 percent of all hand-held devices going out in the next five years are going to have Wi-Fi chips,'' Mr. Blumenstein said.

HEADLINE: Race Is On for Florida Governorship

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE; Gary Fineout contributed reporting from Tallahassee, Fla.

DATELINE: MIAMI 

 BODY:
Less than a week after Gov. Charlie Crist announced that he would run next year for the United States Senate, the race to succeed him has officially begun. 
 Attorney General Bill McCollum, a Republican, announced his candidacy Monday, setting the stage for a battle with Alex Sink, the state's chief financial officer, a Democrat who opened her own campaign last week. 
 Mr. McCollum and Ms. Sink both come in as front-runners, with the backing of state parties. But their backgrounds are vastly different. Ms. Sink is serving her first term in statewide elected office, after a career as a banker. Mr. McCollum, before being elected attorney general in 2006, spent two decades in Congress, where he fought to impeach President Bill Clinton. 
 ''Both are going to be reframing their images,'' said Daniel A. Smith, a political science professor at the University of Florida. ''Bill McCollum has to distance himself from the past, and Alex Sink needs to define herself before she's defined by Bill McCollum.''
 The jockeying could be seen on Monday. At a news conference in Orlando where he announced his candidacy, Mr. McCollum, for years considered Florida's ultimate conservative, cast himself as a pragmatist. 
 ''The hallmark of my administration will be access and inclusion,'' he said. ''It will be an administration that does not focus on partisan labels but brings the brightest minds from every walk of life together -- every race, creed, religion -- to solve problems and move this state forward.'' 
 George LeMieux, former campaign manager for Governor Crist, a Republican, said Mr. McCollum's years of service would be a benefit, because ''in uncertain times, that public service experience is very compelling.'' 
 But political analysts say the establishment ties that help Mr. McCollum with endorsements and contributions may make it hard for him to fashion a new image. He has already lost two statewide campaigns, for the Senate, and some Republicans say they fear that voters have made up their minds about him.
 Charles H. Bronson, the state's commissioner of agriculture and consumer services, hinted at Republican discontent Monday, telling reporters he was considering whether to challenge Mr. McCollum.
 ''This is not about a personal issue,'' Mr. Bronson said. ''This is about one of the most important races of Florida's election year.'' 
 The Democrats have a different challenge: Republicans have historically raised twice as much money for state races in midterm years, Professor Smith said, and Ms. Sink remains largely an unknown. As a moderate, he added, she could have trouble turning out voters.
 ''She's going to have to convince the more liberal Democrats who are not likely to vote to come out in 2010,'' he said. ''And that's not an easy task.''
 Democrats are trying to excite their base with a focus on the economy, an issue that paid dividends in 2008. Eric Jotkoff, a spokesman for the Florida Democratic Party, said Ms. Sink was uniquely suited to turn Florida's recession around. 
 But here in a state that is among the nation's foreclosure capitals, Ms. Sink's own past could be problematic. Though it has been nine years since she left her position as president of Bank of America's Florida operations, Republicans rarely mention her without using a label intended to sound like an insult: ''former banker.''

HEADLINE: In New York, Mrs. Obama Praises Arts as Vital to U.S.

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS

 BODY:
The first lady, Michelle Obama, visited New York City on Monday to promote the arts, celebrating opening night at the American Ballet Theater and the reopening of part of the American Wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. 
 Mrs. Obama described the nation's creative spirit as critical to its ideals and its identity, and said the arts needed to be nurtured even during difficult economic times. She noted that her husband had included $50 million in his economic stimulus package for the National Endowment for the Arts.
 ''The arts are not just a nice thing to have,'' she said, adding that the arts ''define who we are as a people.'' 
 It was Mrs. Obama's first foray into New York's glittering world of high culture as first lady. And she addressed star-studded crowds that included prominent figures from the political world, as well as from the arts and the fashion scene.
 The designer Ralph Lauren, the former model Iman, and Anna Wintour, editor of Vogue, sat in the front row in the audience at the Metropolitan Museum. And Mrs. Obama shared the stage there with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and several members of New York's delegation to Congress.
 At the American Ballet Theater, Mrs. Obama and her husband, President Obama, were listed as honorary co-chairwoman and chairman for Monday night's spring gala, along with the designer Carolina Herrera, Renee Zellweger, Caroline Kennedy and others.
 The first lady seized her moment in the limelight on the grand stage of the Metropolitan Opera House to call on institutions and philanthropists to make the art world readily accessible to children. 
 She praised the Metropolitan Museum and the American Ballet Theater for involving children of diverse backgrounds in their programs.
 ''My husband and I believe strongly that arts education is essential for building innovative thinkers who will be our nation's leaders of tomorrow,'' said Mrs. Obama, who introduced a performance by a multiracial cast of young dancers. 
 Mrs. Obama served as the official ribbon cutter at the reopening of the Metropolitan Museum's Charles Engelhard Court and the American period rooms, which showcase American furniture, sculpture, stained glass, ceramics, silver and other artwork. The wing, which has been closed for two years of construction and renovation, will reopen to the public on Tuesday.
 ''The president and I want to ensure that all children have access to great works of art,'' said Mrs. Obama, who spoke to an audience at the museum that included dozens of public schoolchildren.
 ''This is your place, too,'' she told the children.

HEADLINE: In Mayoral Race, No One Outspends Bloomberg, Except Bloomberg

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN. 
E-mail: haberman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Many of you will recall an old commercial for a New York supermarket chain, the one with a jingle that said imploringly, ''So please, Mr. D'Agostino, move closer to me.'' We now make the same appeal to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. Please, Mr. Bloomberg, move closer to us.
 We don't have nearly enough of your campaign offices in our neighborhoods. Really, we don't. 
 The mayor's re-election campaign, which has more money at its disposal than some governments do, announced the other day that it had opened six new offices. That brought the total in the five boroughs to 11, ''part of the ongoing effort,'' the campaign said, ''to reach voters in every neighborhood across the city.''
 Bravo! We need as many of these offices as possible.
 If your neighborhood is anything like mine, the streets are dotted with empty stores, victims in many cases of rapacious landlords who, with City Hall's tacit blessing, jacked up rents to unsustainable levels. Only the bottom fell out of the economy. Those vacant storefronts, with their sad ''space available'' signs in the windows, are a dispiriting blight.
 Think of how much cheerier they would be if only they were filled with Mayor Mike campaign offices.
 For starters, campaign workers spend money. They send out for coffee and sandwiches. That puts cash in the pockets of local merchants.
 But more important than money is the morale boost that we would all get from being able to see Mr. Bloomberg's countenance everywhere.
 You may think it's enough that you've received several glossy brochures from the Bloomberg campaign, and it's only mid-May. You may be growing inured to the cascade of Bloomberg commercials on local news broadcasts and on ''Jeopardy!'' On Saturday, while mulling whether to back the favored filly Rachel Alexandra in the Preakness Stakes or go with a longer shot, we caught one of the mayor's vote-for-me commercials in the pre-race yak-athon.
 But you can never have too much of a good thing. Let a thousand Bloombergs bloom, in every corner of the boroughs.
 Sure, you will hear grousing about the fortune that he is tossing around. On the surface, the $18.7 million spent thus far by his campaign may seem like a lot. But that's mainly because it is twice what the mayor spent at this point in his 2005 race. Is it his fault that his main opponent, City Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr., has been able to spend only $1.7 million?
 Mr. Bloomberg is doing only what is necessary. That has always been the case. When he first ran for mayor in 2001, he spent about $75 million because he had to introduce himself to New Yorkers, most of whom didn't know who he was, even though he had slapped his name on almost everything he touched. After he won, he assured voters that he would not have to shell out anything like that to run again.
 In 2005 he spent more than $84 million. But he had to. ''I think it is difficult to get a message out,'' he said at the time, explaining why he had outspent his opponent by roughly 9 to 1.
 If anything, he needs more money to get a message out this year. How else can he go about ''engaging voters in a dialogue,'' as a campaign spokesman put it? It's not as if it's enough to hold a daily news conference at City Hall and to issue reams of news releases, especially with a chorus of complainers out there accusing him of having trampled on the democratic process to get term limits extended for his own purposes.
 The dissenters will prattle on, people like the fellow who after the 2005 election co-wrote an opinion article in this newspaper. As The Daily News noted over the weekend, this man said back then that while Mr. Bloomberg's bankbook alone did not explain his victory, his ''lopsided'' spending style ''prevents voters from hearing both sides in an evenhanded manner and distorts the terms of the debate.''
 The writer was Howard L. Wolfson, a longtime Democratic operative.
 Hang on -- can this critic of elephant-size spending be the same Howard Wolfson who is now helping guide the 2009 Bloomberg effort (for what is no doubt a lopsided amount of money)? Yes, it is. Mr. Bloomberg, elected twice as a Republican, has similarly purchased the services -- and, by extension, the silence -- of other political professionals who normally work only for Democrats.
 Why not? What's the point of having $16 billion if you can't use a thick slab of it to drop on anyone who would oppose you?

 CORRECTION:
An article in some editions on Saturday about the release of documents showing that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has spent $18.7 million on his re-election campaign so far -- nearly twice what he had spent at this point in the 2005 race -- referred incompletely to his total campaign spending for his election in 2001. The amount, $81 million, is adjusted for inflation as of 2005.

HEADLINE: Obama to Toughen Rules On Emissions and Mileage

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER; Micheline Maynard and Bill Vlasic contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama will announce tough new nationwide rules for automobile emissions and mileage standards on Tuesday, embracing standards that California has sought to enact for years over the objections of the auto industry and the Bush administration.
 The rules, which will begin to take effect in 2012, will put in place a federal standard for fuel efficiency that is as tough as the California program, while imposing the first-ever limits on climate-altering gases from cars and trucks.
 The effect will be a single new national standard that will create a car and light truck fleet in the United States that is almost 40 percent cleaner and more fuel-efficient by 2016 than it is today, with an average of 35.5 miles per gallon.
 Environmental advocates and industry officials welcomed the new program, but for different reasons. Environmentalists called it a long-overdue tightening of emissions and fuel economy standards after decades of government delay and industry opposition. Auto industry officials said it would provide the single national efficiency standard they have long desired, a reasonable timetable to meet it and the certainty they need to proceed with product development plans. 
 Yet the industry position represents an abrupt about-face after years of battling tougher mileage standards in the courts and in Congress, reflecting the change in the political climate and the automakers' shaky financial condition. The decision comes as General Motors and Chrysler are receiving billions of dollars in federal help, closing hundreds of dealerships and trying to design the products and business strategy they will need to survive. 
 ''For seven long years, there has been a debate over whether states or the federal government should regulate autos,'' said Dave McCurdy, president of the Alliance of Auto Manufacturers, the industry's largest trade association. ''President Obama's announcement ends that old debate by starting a federal rulemaking to set a national program.''
 Mr. McCurdy, a former Democratic congressman from Oklahoma, has been working with Mr. Obama and his advisers on the issue since early this year.
 In announcing the new program at the White House, Mr. Obama will be accompanied by Gov. Jennifer Granholm of Michigan and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, along with auto industry executives and environmental leaders. 
 The administration's decision resolves a question over California's application for a waiver from federal clean air laws to impose its own, tougher vehicle emissions standards. Thirteen states and the District of Columbia have said they plan to adopt the California program. 
 The new national fleet mileage rule for cars and light trucks of 35.5 miles per gallon by 2016 roughly corresponds to the California requirement, which will be shelved as a result. The current national standard is slightly more than 25 miles per gallon.
 The California plan, first proposed in 2002, had been stalled by industry lawsuits and the Bush administration's refusal to grant a waiver from less stringent federal rules, although California has been given dozens of such exemptions over the last 40 years. 
 The program will also end a number of lawsuits over the California standards, officials said.
 ''This is a very big deal,'' said Daniel Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign, who has pushed for tougher mileage and emissions standards for two decades with the goal of curbing the gases that have been linked to global warming. ''This is the single biggest step the American government has ever taken to cut greenhouse gas emissions.''
 The administration had faced a June 30 deadline set by Congress to decide whether to grant California's application to put its emissions rules into effect. President Obama became personally involved in the issue because he was also trying to find a way to rescue American auto companies from their financial crisis.
 One ranking industry official said that the administration wanted to get the new mileage rules in place before General Motors made a decision on a bankruptcy filing, which could happen by the end of this month. The new rules also provide some certainty for Chrysler, which is already under bankruptcy protection, so that it can plan its future models.
 To meet the new federal standards, auto companies will have to drastically change their product lineups in a relatively short time.
 The companies have declined so far to comment on the costs involved in meeting a fleet standard of 35 miles a gallon. For starters, the automakers will probably have to sharply reduce the number of low-mileage models, like pickup trucks and large sedans.
 The president's decision will also accelerate the development of smaller cars and engines already under way. 
 But Mr. McCurdy said the industry could meet the new mileage targets using existing technology and improvements in future models. He said that 130 models already got 30 miles a gallon or better on the highway. 
 In January, Mr. Obama directed the Environmental Protection Agency to reconsider the Bush administration's past rejection of the California application. He also instructed the Transportation Department to draw up rules to complement a 2007 law requiring a 40 percent improvement in mileage for autos and light trucks by 2020. The Bush administration wrote no regulations to enforce the 2007 law. 
 Mr. Obama will direct the E.P.A. and the Transportation Department to jointly write enforcement regulations.
 Daniel J. Weiss, director of climate strategy at the liberal Center for American Progress, said that under the White House plan, California would retain the ability to set its own emissions standards in the future when the current program expired.
 He also said the new administration program was very close in language and intent to a provision in the climate change and energy bill now before the House Energy and Commerce Committee. That bill calls for a ''harmonization'' of the California and federal regulatory programs to provide a nationwide standard.
 Mr. Obama has been thinking about the future of the American automobile industry for years. He co-sponsored two bills in 2006, during his second year as a United States senator, one to raise fuel economy standards and the other to encourage the use of alternative fuels.
 During the presidential campaign, he gave a speech in Detroit chastising the American automobile industry for doing too little to reduce the nation's dependence on foreign oil and improve their vehicles' efficiency.
 ''The auto industry's refusal to act for so long has left it mired in a predicament for which there is no easy way out,'' Mr. Obama said.
 That inaction has been a factor in the current dire state in which General Motors and Chrysler find themselves. The Japanese automakers are far ahead in developing smaller, more efficient vehicles, although they, too, will have to adjust their product lines.
 Fran Pavley, the California state senator who sponsored the legislation that established the California standard, praised the decision as she traveled to Washington Monday to join the White House meeting on Tuesday. 
 She said through a spokeswoman that California would work on its own rules while the federal regulations were drafted. ''This cleans up our air, reduces our dependence on foreign oil and continues to allow California to lead the way,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Court Case Of Dissident Under Way In Myanmar

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS and MARK McDONALD; Seth Mydans reported from Bangkok, and Mark McDonald from Hong Kong.

DATELINE: BANGKOK 

 BODY:
Myanmar's pro-democracy leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, went on trial on Monday in a mostly procedural hearing as hundreds of police officers and army soldiers blocked crowds of protesters, according to reports from news agencies and opposition exile groups.
 Several foreign diplomats were prevented from entering the court where Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi faced charges that could bring a prison term of up to five years, according to the reports. A United States Embassy official was allowed to enter because another defendant in the trial is an American man who swam across a lake this month and spent a night in Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's house. 
 Though the American, John Yettaw, appeared to have acted without her knowledge, his adventure led to charges that she violated the terms of the house arrest that has limited her outside contact for 13 of the past 19 years. 
 The trial was the most aggressive action that the ruling junta had taken in recent years against Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, 63, who has remained the symbolic leader of an opposition that continues to resurface after repeated crackdowns. Most analysts viewed the charges as a pretext for extending her latest six-year term of house arrest before a general election scheduled for next spring, in which the junta aims to formalize the dominance of the military under a new Constitution.
 Some analysts also say the charges could herald a broader clampdown on political dissent and pro-democracy figures in anticipation of the election.
 Although the government carried out a purge of opposition activists after an uprising led by Buddhist monks in 2007, demonstrators were on the streets again on Monday, handing out leaflets and challenging police officers, soldiers and civilian militias, who were carrying bamboo rods and canes, according to the Burma Partnership, an exile opposition group.
 ''In terms of security measures they've deployed, it's very difficult for people to come together for a big march,'' said Khin Ohmar of the Thailand-based Burma Partnership, who said she was in direct contact with members of the opposition inside the nation, which was formerly known as Burma.
 It was not clear how long the trial might last, but Ms. Khin Ohmar said officials had announced that the streets around the prison would be closed off for a week.
 The charges have brought broad condemnation from the United Nations, Western countries and even some of Myanmar's normally accommodating Southeast Asian neighbors.
 The United States, which had said it was reviewing a hard-line policy of economic sanctions, announced last week that the measures would be extended for another year. On Monday the European Union's foreign policy chief, Javier Solana, said, ''It's not the moment to lower sanctions, it's the moment in any case to increase them.''
 Among Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's supporters, including exile groups and her own lawyers, there is widespread anger at the American man for putting her at risk of imprisonment.
 Mr. Yettaw, from Falcon, Mo., swam across Inya Lake in central Yangon this month and sneaked into Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's lakeside compound at night. He used empty plastic jugs to keep himself afloat during his swim, and he had a pair of makeshift flippers strapped to his feet, according to reports in the official Myanmar press.
 The reasons for his escapade remained unclear, although an American diplomat said last week that Mr. Yettaw seemed to have religious motivations for trying to visit the house. Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's principal lawyer, who called Mr. Yettaw ''a nutty fellow'' and ''a fool,'' said Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi had pleaded with him to leave, but he complained of exhaustion and leg cramps. She gave him a ground-floor room while she stayed in her bedroom upstairs. 
 The government does not allow Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi to have foreign visitors at her home, and even senior diplomats are denied permission to see her there. When the occasional United Nations envoy is allowed to speak with her, it is at a government guest house in Yangon, formerly Rangoon, the country's main city. Also, overnight guests are prohibited at her home. 
 Mr. Yettaw, 53, a Mormon, was reported to have prayed often while he was at the house. He is said to have left late the following night and was spotted by the police while he was swimming back across the lake. 
 He is facing trial along with Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi and two women who share her home.

HEADLINE: In Japan, Secure Jobs Have a Cost

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

DATELINE: OSAKA, Japan 

 BODY:
When the sheet metal orders coming into his small business, High Metal, fell by half last October, it never occurred to Masaaki Taruki to lay off his workers.
 Instead, he set about brainstorming new projects to occupy them. An indoor vegetable garden? A handicrafts workshop?
 Because of government subsidies, Mr. Taruki in the last three months installed rows of parsley, watercress and other plants, using factory space that has been empty since the company disposed of unused machinery. High Metal's staff tend the sprouts religiously, topping up the water supply, adding fertilizer and adjusting the fluorescent lights. 
 When sales at the machinery maker Shinano Kogyo in central Japan plunged some 70 percent late last year, the company started dispatching its idle workers to sweep the streets and pick up trash in the wider community, while remaining on the payroll.
 According to statistics released Wednesday, the Japanese economy suffered its worst contraction since 1955 in the first quarter, declining 15.2 percent on an annualized basis. But a far smaller portion of workers have lost their jobs in Japan than in either the United States or the European Union. (Japan's unemployment rate in April was 4.8 percent, compared with 8.9 percent in the United States and Europe.) 
 Analysts say this is because lifetime employment is alive and well in Japan, with the state playing a big role in keeping it so.
 ''Job tenure in Japan remains remarkably long,'' said Peter Matanle, an expert on Japanese employment at the University of Sheffield in Britain. ''Companies get rid of the buffers first. They'll get rid of temporary workers, reduce overtime, reduce bonuses. They would squeeze their suppliers. They would do anything before considering cutting regular workers.''
 But Japan's obsession with keeping workers employed -- even those who are not needed -- comes at a cost. 
 Companies slash wages, which reduces consumer spending. Businesses become more reluctant to take on new recruits, shutting young people out of the labor force. And productivity plummets, hurting Japan's competitiveness in an increasingly aggressive international market.
 ''By helping to maintain excess employment, you face the risk of keeping alive businesses that are no longer competitive, and perhaps whose productive era is over,'' said Hisashi Yamada, an economist at the Japan Research Institute, a private research group in Tokyo. ''This could hurt employment in the long run. What you need is more structural change.''
 The lifetime employment system, cemented in Japan's postwar economic boom, bound dutiful workers and paternalistic employers together, producing a mutual loyalty (and labor harmony) rarely seen in the West.
 By law, employers can cut workers' hours but must pay at least 60 percent of their hourly wages during that time. The government has budgeted 60 billion yen, or about $624 million, this year to reimburse companies for half of those payments. In March, about 48,000 companies sought subsidies for 2.38 million employees, government figures show. 
 Even large exporters, like Nissan Motor and NEC Electronics, have used the subsidies to keep workers employed despite shorter factory hours.
 In a recent survey by the Nikkei financial daily, zero percent of large business owners said they had plans to lay off permanent staff members, compared with 39 percent in South Korea. Experts say that without subsidies, Japan's unemployment rate would be as much as 2 percentage points higher.
 Since Japanese workers are hard to lay off, companies have turned to temporary workers, who receive lower pay and fewer benefits, and can be cut more easily. Such workers now make up a third of Japan's work force.
 But keeping all those permanent staff members occupied is its own challenge.
 Mr. Taruki's factory has been abuzz with activity over the vegetable garden. Using another government subsidy, Mr. Taruki spent 5 million yen to start a handicrafts workshop, installing a laser etching machine in a tiny room that had housed employee lockers. There, an employee practiced etching patterns onto lacquerware boards, small sheets of glass and other materials.
 The company wants to make key chains and other trinkets, and is exploring ways to make ornaments for Buddhist altars.
 ''Even if the economy starts recovering, I'm doubtful whether we'll ever bounce back entirely,'' said Mr. Taruki, whose grandfather started the factory in Osaka decades ago. ''So I need to start filling in what we've lost. It's the responsibility of companies to protect jobs, to grow them.''
 But some analysts wonder whether the recession will be so bad that Japanese companies will have to eventually start cutting regular workers. 
 Labor leaders say cases are increasing in which employees are subjected to such humiliating wage or hour cuts, or demotions, that they are driven to quit.
 Some analysts say a cold-eyed look at bloated payrolls is just what Japanese companies need.
 ''Companies have hardly shed workers so far in this episode,'' Carl B. Weinberg, who runs the economics analysis firm High Frequency Economics, said in a note to clients this month. ''Massive layoffs are imminent, but they won't come soon enough.''

HEADLINE: City Loses Jazz Fest As Backer Falters

BYLINE: By BEN SISARIO

 BODY:
Around this time of year, posters for the JVC Jazz Festival would be appearing on the streets of New York, and jazz tourists would be finalizing plans to arrive in the middle of June for two weeks of bragworthy shows. 
 But for the first time in 37 years, there will be no major summer jazz festival in New York. Nor will there be related series in Miami or Chicago, as the concert company behind them is suffering a financial crisis. 
 At stake is one of the most celebrated legacies in American music. Two years ago the impresario George Wein sold his company, Festival Productions, to a group led by Chris Shields, a charismatic entrepreneur who planned to transform Mr. Wein's empire through aggressive growth. Now that plan has all but collapsed, as Mr. Shields's company, Festival Network, has lost its top sponsor, as well as several signature festivals, delivering what many call a painful blow to jazz.
 In an interview Mr. Shields, 38, largely blamed the economy for his company's woes. ''I'll certainly take criticism for the robust growth plan,'' he said. ''It may have been too robust for the time. I think if we weren't faced with this economy, we would have been just fine.'' 
 But business associates and former employees, many of whom would not comment publicly because the company still owes them money, say that Festival Network overspent on booking talent and took unnecessary risks, including opening four new festivals last summer without securing sufficient sponsorship. 
 ''He was ambitious but perhaps overwhelmed with the realities of the New York market,'' said Michael Dorf, who runs City Winery and hired Mr. Shields for the Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival in 2000. ''There's something that comes from cutting your teeth working day in and day out in New York concert promotion. I don't think Chris had that experience level.''
 Last year Festival Network presented 17 festivals around the world, but Mr. Shields said he has none to announce this year. The company lost its contract for the Newport jazz and folk festivals in Rhode Island because of late payments for use of state parkland. The Freihofer's Jazz Festival in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., another longtime Wein event, has gone to a competitor, and last month JVC said that after 24 years with Mr. Wein, it would no longer be sponsoring jazz.
 Festival Network's troubles, however, reach farther than Newport. In Mali, the Festival in the Desert -- a renowned world-music event each January in the remote sands beyond Timbuktu -- was almost canceled this year after beginning an association with Festival Network. 
 Manny Ansar, the Malian founder of the Festival in the Desert, said the agreement, finalized at Newport last summer, called for Festival Network to provide a range of assistance, including enough money to produce this year's event. According to Mr. Ansar's American lawyer, Thomas Rome, that amount exceeded $600,000. 
 But communication broke down, and most of that money never came, Mr. Ansar said. The festival went on, he added, with financing from the governments of Mali, Morocco and Burkina Faso. Mr. Ansar spoke in French in a telephone interview that was translated by Mr. Rome.
 Mr. Shields said that his company had invested $150,000 in the Festival in the Desert, but denied that Festival Network had agreed to finance it fully. (Mr. Ansar, for his part, said he believed the agreements were made in good faith, and he has not filed a lawsuit for the money. ''In my culture,'' he said, ''one doesn't abandon a friend because he's in trouble.'') 
 Mr. Shields, whose own tastes lean more to folk than to jazz, had a modest profile in music before taking over Mr. Wein's company. After graduating from Columbia in 1993, he worked briefly for Mr. Wein, and in 1998 he developed a festival on Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard. In 2000 he worked under Mr. Dorf as a director of the Bell Atlantic Jazz Festivals in New York, Boston, Philadelphia and Washington. 
 But for the Festival Productions deal, he had major financial backers, including Richard Sands, the chairman and chief executive of Constellation Brands, the beer and wine conglomerate. Festival Productions was purchased for about $4 million, according to both Mr. Wein and Mr. Shields, and Festival Network announced plans to build a portfolio of world-class festivals by presenting ''destination'' events in prime locations. 
 ''The goal of the company,'' Mr. Shields said, ''was to create enough original and desired location-based festivals that the Fortune 500s of the world would look at that umbrella of festivals and say, 'We want to come in and sponsor the entire body.' ''
 Acquiring Festival Productions was a coup for the young company. Mr. Wein, 83, enjoys a singular reputation as the patriarch of the American festival, and he had a history of rebuffing previous offers. In an interview he said the deal with Festival Network came along at the right time. ''I was at a point in my life where I was cashing in,'' he said. 
 Mr. Wein stayed on as producer emeritus. Ben Ratliff of The New York Times praised the lineup of the 2008 JVC festival in New York, calling it ''undiminished and newly energized by welcome changes of locations and some imaginative bookings.'' 
 By last summer, though, the company was feeling a financial pinch. Mr. Shields said that sponsorship had fallen short of expectations; new festivals in Jackson Hole, Wyo.; Whistler, British Columbia; and San Francisco lacked major sponsors and had weak attendance. Mr. Shields says he stopped paying himself a salary in September, as the market crashed, and by December he stopped paying staff members. At its peak the company had 37 employees, but now is down to 6.
 After the company lost the Newport contracts, Mr. Wein announced that he would be presenting folk and jazz festivals there in August under his own name. (A spokeswoman for the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management, which administers the state parks, said Festival Network had paid its outstanding debts.)
 The disappearance of several former JVC festivals, particularly in New York, have deprived many musicians of some of their most lucrative engagements this summer. But more important, many in the jazz world say, their loss sends a misleading signal about the health of the music.
 ''Losing a major jazz festival kind of tells the world that maybe this music isn't marketable,'' said Joel Chriss, a booking agent whose roster includes Randy Brecker and Freddy Cole. ''It's potentially dangerous.''
 Mr. Shields says the story is not over. He wants to present a New York jazz festival next year. Although his company has been battered, he says its underlying model is sound. ''This business plan can succeed, absolutely,'' he said. ''You've seen it succeed in the promotions business, you've seen it happen in sports, you've seen it happen in management. We by no means have given up.''

HEADLINE: H.P. Lowers Its Forecast, Cutting Jobs As Profit Falls

BYLINE: By ASHLEE VANCE

 BODY:
For those investors who were seeing more optimistic signs of economic recovery in the technology industry, Hewlett-Packard has played the role of the spoiler.
 On Tuesday, H.P., the world's largest technology company, reported double-digit declines in sales across its major businesses in its second quarter. H.P. also said that it would cut about 2 percent of its 321,000-person work force, or close to 6,420 people, as it tries to reduce costs. 
 The layoffs are on top of the tens of thousands of people already being let go as part of H.P.'s acquisition of Electronic Data Systems, a large services company. 
 The computer and printer maker also issued a more pessimistic full-year revenue forecast. It now expects revenue to fall from 4 percent to 5 percent from the $118.4 billion reported last year, while it had previously predicted that sales would fall from 2 percent to 5 percent.
 Mark V. Hurd, the chief executive at H.P., pointed to better sales in China and among consumers in the United States as the only two bright spots of note. Over all, however, he remained somber about the broad economic trends that affect the technology sector. 
 ''I just think we are going to need another quarter of data to really make a meaningful statement about any upturn or anything like that,'' Mr. Hurd said in a conference call with analysts to discuss the second-quarter results. ''Our guidance is meant to be a sort of 'steady as she goes.' '' 
 H.P., with a broad range of businesses spread across the globe, serves as a bellwether of the technology sector. The forecast from H.P., the world's largest PC maker, comes in contrast to the most recent forecast from Intel, the world's largest chip maker. Intel executives have maintained that the personal computer market appears to have reached bottom weeks ago and that market conditions are better than expected midway through the second quarter.
 Catherine A. Lesjak, the chief financial officer at H.P., declined to issue any similar, upbeat remarks about PC sales, saying only that ''demand looks a lot like it did last quarter.''
 Investors appeared rattled at least in part by H.P.'s revenue forecast that reinforced sentiment that the economy is not yet improving. Following the release of the results, H.P.'s shares dropped close to 5 percent, during after-hours trading, to $34.81. Shares of H.P. had closed in regular trading Tuesday, up more than 2 percent at $36.58. 
 H.P. said net income in the second quarter ended April 30 fell 17 percent to $1.7 billion, or 70 cents a share, down from a profit of $2.1 billion, or 80 cents a share, in the same period last year. Excluding charges, H.P., based in Palo Alto, Calif., earned 88 cents a share for the period ended April 30. 
 H.P. surpassed the earnings expectations of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters by 2 cents, while its revenue matched expectations. 
 Like other hardware makers, H.P. has had big declines in its major businesses. Notebook PC sales fell 13 percent; computer server and storage sales tumbled 28 percent; software sales fell 15 percent and sales of printers and related technology fell 23 percent. 
 Given such circumstances, Mr. Hurd focused on H.P.'s continued efforts to cut costs, allowing it to stay on pace with earnings expectations even while revenue was harder to find. The company reported record cash flow from operations of $5 billion in the quarter.
 ''The results do point to the stability of the H.P. model,'' said Shannon Cross, the managing director of Cross Research, an equities research firm. 
 Mr. Hurd often emphasizes H.P.'s ability to alter its costs from quarter-to-quarter by making tweaks to the company's vast supply chain. In addition, H.P.'s $13.9 billion purchase of E.D.S. last year has given it a new source revenue from services that has aided recent results. 
 H.P.'s services revenue increased 99 percent with the addition of E.D.S., to $8.5 billion. Since services deals often cover a number of years, the revenue tied to the agreements tends to remain steadier than hardware sales. Mr. Hurd's focus on running such a lean organization does come with certain costs. The latest round of layoffs adds to the massive E.D.S.-related cuts and salary reductions across the company. ''It all has to impact morale,'' Ms. Cross said. ''But I think people also understand that tough decisions need to be made.''

HEADLINE: Groups Seek to Stop Public Financing of New Towers at Ground Zero

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Some of the city's largest civic groups jumped into the simmering dispute at ground zero on Tuesday, saying that government should improve transportation networks downtown and not put any more money into the development of speculative office towers on the 16-acre site.
 Their call addresses an impasse between the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the World Trade Center site, and the developer, Larry A. Silverstein, who is to build three skyscrapers there. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has asked that the governors of New York and New Jersey, the authority and Mr. Silverstein meet with him at Gracie Mansion on Thursday to resolve the latest dispute in the long and tortured effort to rebuild the trade center. 
 Seven civic groups, including the Regional Plan Association, the Fiscal Policy Institute and the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, called on the mayor and the governors to ensure ''that no additional public funds are used to subsidize office construction on the site.'' The funds are needed more, the groups said, for the $3.2 billion transportation hub there and a new passenger rail tunnel under the Hudson River.
 ''These investments will support new commercial activity,'' the civic groups said in a letter to the officials, ''but it is the responsibility of the private sector to absorb the risk of new construction.''
 Unable to obtain financing for the towers, Mr. Silverstein has asked the Port Authority to guarantee more than $3 billion in loans he needs to erect at least two of the towers along Church Street between Vesey and Liberty Streets. The authority, which is already building a large tower at the northwest corner of the site, balked. 
 At a time when office rents are falling and vacancies rising downtown, it did not want to become involved with more speculative office space, especially now that its own capital budget is threatened by sharply falling bridge and tunnel revenue.
 In a move that infuriated Mr. Silverstein, the authority offered to back only one of his towers, with about $800 million. The authority said it would help build Mr. Silverstein's other two towers in the coming decades once demand for new office space increases, although the developer was free to move ahead at any time with private financing.
 Janno Lieber, who oversees the trade center project for Mr. Silverstein, said Tuesday in a statement: ''If, as the Port Authority apparently believes, the New York regional economy is permanently dead and buried, it's hard to see how they can justify huge investments in the World Trade Center PATH hub, new tunnels, and other facilities designed to serve expanded commuter populations.''
 Stephen Sigmund, a spokesman for the authority, countered that it made more sense for the authority to ''put its limited public resources toward keeping the memorial and the public projects moving forward,'' while building the office and retail components when there is demand for new space.
 The two sides have not had any substantive talks in more than a month. On May 8, the speaker of the State Assembly, Sheldon Silver, whose district includes downtown, called on the authority to help Mr. Silverstein begin construction on two of his towers. But Mr. Silver also said Mr. Silverstein must invest some of his own money if he is to reap the profits from the buildings.
 Mayor Bloomberg immediately endorsed Mr. Silver's initiative and asked all the parties to meet at Grace Mansion within a week, a move that took Mr. Silverstein, the authority and even Gov. David A. Paterson by surprise. Most of the participants said on Tuesday they were unsure what the meeting would achieve.
 Andrew Brent, a spokesman for the mayor, said, ''If the stalemate between the Port Authority and Silverstein Properties ends where it's headed -- in litigation or arbitration -- everyone loses,'' and added, ''We are convening the parties on Thursday to arrive at a path toward resolution that maintains progress on the site.'' 
 The governor wants the project to continue to make progress, said a spokeswoman, Erin Duggan, but believes that ''the public should not be the ones taking on all of the risk for private development.''

HEADLINE: Moving On in the U.S., Growing the Ways to Go

BYLINE: By MIKE HALE

 BODY:
The PBS project ''Blueprint America'' is a series of news reports and documentaries about the American infrastructure, that conglomeration of roads, rails, canals, power plants and other large things that we're preparing to spend many billions of dollars to upgrade. Putting ''Blueprint'' in the title would seem to promise some sort of plan or at least a detailed suggestion, but the documentary ''Road to the Future'' (Wednesday on most PBS stations) doesn't have much to offer in the way of concrete advice.
 The brisk one-hour program, reported by the correspondent Miles O'Brien, provides snapshots of the contrasting state of transportation in three American cities. It's the good, the bad and the not as ugly as you thought: Portland, Ore., all light rail and happy bikers; Denver, all choked highways and deadening suburban sprawl, artfully captured by the PBS cameras; and New York, the city that's the greenest and least car-dependent in America, despite all those honking cabs. 
 A lot of work went into these brief surveys, which are handsomely shot and have an interesting array of talking heads, including the urban studies scholar Owen D. Gutfreund and the former Colorado governor and slow-growth advocate Richard D. Lamm. But the segments are also larded with generic history -- car culture, the interstate highways, the emptying of the central cities -- and the accompanying generic images: tail fins, Eisenhower, Levittown.
 Mr. O'Brien ties the transportation situations in Denver and Portland to local attitudes toward suburban development. It is certainly valid but seems simplistic: what about geography, energy sources, differences in local economies? And what does any of this civic history have to do with the future of our infrastructure, which is supposedly the point? It often feels as if a longer, more discursive report on urban planning had been shoehorned into the ''Blueprint'' format. 
 The segment on New York does look at some current initiatives, discussing Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's congestion pricing proposal and visiting one of the pocket seating areas recently installed in the middle of the city's streets. (New Yorkers will note that the block of Ninth Avenue south of 14th Street, where Mr. O'Brien admires the cafe tables with Janette Sadik-Khan, the city's transportation commissioner, tends to be congested only by clubgoers looking for cabs between the hours of 10 p.m. and 2 a.m.) 
 The program jogs down to Washington for its last few minutes and a concluding bromide: it's all about federal funds. Will the next transportation bill, due this year, favor highways or mass transit? Again, this seems awfully simplistic. If it is all about the federal government, then what we hear isn't necessarily reassuring for those hoping that public transportation will win the infrastructure wars. 
 ''This administration is thinking about transit, is thinking about high-speed rail, more than it's ever been thought about before,'' Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood says.
 That's an awful lot of thinking; will there be any energy left for doing?

HEADLINE: Mini Versions of Big-Box Stores

BYLINE: By KRISTINA SHEVORY

DATELINE: BOTHELL, Wash. 

 BODY:
During the current economic downturn, as many companies are closing stores and cutting costs, it might seem counterintuitive to be opening new stores.
 Not here in Bothell, around 20 miles northeast of Seattle, where in January, OfficeMax opened one of its three new concept stores in the Seattle area that offer a pared-down selection of its most popular products. Each of the new stores, called Ink Paper Scissors, covers only 2,000 square feet -- about a ninth the size of a typical OfficeMax -- and offers basics like copy-making supplies and printer-cartridge refills.
 Retailers like OfficeMax are opening scaled-down versions of their stores or inventing outlets entirely to test new concepts without a hefty investment. The stores are a relatively safe bet despite the recession because the space is cheaper and the stores require less inventory, fewer employees and smaller spaces. 
 OfficeMax is not the only retailer giving new concept stores a try. Most are significantly smaller than their typical stores and focus on one set of products. Last year, for example, Wal-Mart opened four specialty food stores in the Phoenix area, RadioShack unveiled three high-end wireless shops in Dallas, and Best Buy created 30 mobile phone stores.
 ''If you've got the wherewithal, everyone is thinking about smaller sizes,'' said Lee Peterson, vice president for brand and creative services at WD Partners in Columbus, Ohio, which has helped retailers design these stores.
 More small-format and new-concept stores are likely to be on the way as retailers try to lure customers back, according to a survey of retailers, manufacturers and consultants. Nearly 46 percent of the respondents said they expected the number of formats to increase in the next five years, according to a survey in February by Dechert-Hampe & Company, a marketplace management consultancy.
 The stores are opening even as some companies are declaring bankruptcy, closing stores and reporting double-digit earnings drops. As the economy contracts and consumers tighten their spending, more closings are likely. In March, the most recent data available, Americans were saving 4.2 percent of their income, after taxes, up from 0.2 percent a year earlier, according to the Commerce Department.
 ''Obviously, it's not an optimal time,'' said Ryan Vero, OfficeMax's chief merchandising officer. ''But this makes for a great test -- it can't be any worse.'' 
 Smaller formats also allow companies to enter new markets in urban or rural areas that they had bypassed during the boom. They can get into a market, test a new concept and get out quickly if it doesn't work.
 The Lowe's Companies, the home repair giant, has been hit hard by the housing downturn and has cut its new store openings to 60 to 70 this year, from 115 last year. But the company, which is based in Mooresville, N.C., is also experimenting with scaled-back stores in new markets. Lowe's has slowed its plans to open stores in the hard-hit states of Florida, Arizona and California, and is aiming at the Midwest and rural communities far from its warehouse stores.
 Last year, Lowe's opened two scaled-down versions of 66,000 square feet and 80,000 square feet. An average Lowe's store is 117,000 square feet.
 Many retailers don't want to cease opening new stores altogether during the downturn, because doing so could harm future earnings. It can take up to three years to develop and open a store. But opening during a recession can position a retailer for success when the economy turns.
 ''Retailers have pulled back the reins somewhat, but they're not going to pull back entirely,'' said Daniel Butler, vice president of retail operations at the National Retail Federation in Washington.
 Smaller stores are also cheaper and less risky. An average Lowe's costs $20 million to $22 million to build, not including inventory. Smaller stores save the chain an average of almost 10 percent, or $1.9 million, per store. 
 They also can attract new customers who might be put off by larger stores or consumers who shop mostly online. Downsized or concept stores are more convenient and take less time to visit than a large store. Lines are typically shorter, and the shopping aisles can be easier to navigate.
 In some ways, retailers are going back to their roots, evoking the corner store. At many new stores, personalized service is being emphasized, like explaining the features of a product. 
 ''Consumers want stores that are more convenient, less time-consuming and more personal,'' said Ben Ball, senior vice president at Dechert-Hampe & Company. ''There is such a thing as too much variety.'' 
 Best Buy is aiming to lure people away from their computers and into their new Best Buy Mobile stores with a selection of 90 cellphones and service plans from nine carriers. 
 Most of the stand-alone shops are 900 to 1,200 square feet, versus 40,000 square feet for a big-box Best Buy. Some 3,000-square-foot versions have also opened. Best Buy now has 40 stand-alone stores and plans more.
 Best Buy is focusing on the cellphone and smartphone market because the segment is expected to keep growing and the company needs to shore up flagging earnings. Best Buy's goal is to have 10 percent of the country's cellphone market, up from about 3 percent now. 
 ''We've been in the mobile business for years, but despite our best efforts, we haven't been able to make much impact in cellphones,'' said Scott Moore, vice president of marketing for Best Buy Mobile. 
 RadioShack is also eyeing the wireless market. In December, the company opened three Point Mobl stores in the Dallas area; they carry smartphones, among other electronics items. Each store is 1,500 square feet, or about the size of a typical RadioShack. The new stores do not mention the parent company.
 Retailing professionals doubt the experimentation with store formats is over. ''It's a very liquid time for retailers,'' said Mr. Peterson at WD Partners. '' 'Let's try it' is now the mantra.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Weighs How to Let Banks Give Money Back

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY and ERIC DASH

 BODY:
It began on Oct. 13, in an atmosphere of panic, with an ultimatum from Washington. Now, the nation's largest banks see a chance to bring an end to the bailout era. 
 After so much bad news, it scarcely seems possible. But having regained a financial footing as well as a bit of their old swagger, major banks are racing to pay back billions of taxpayer dollars. Many insist they will do so by year-end.
 Few in Washington or on Wall Street expected such a quick reversal. Many said they believed banks would rely on the government for years. Banks, the thinking went, would need help coping with bad subprime mortgages and other troublesome assets that led to the financial crisis. 
 But now that big banks seem to have stabilized, regulators are trying to determine how and when these institutions should be allowed to return their bailout money -- and whether such a step might leave banks vulnerable to another crisis should the economy turn for the worse. 
 Two weeks after the results of the federal stress tests, several banks, among them Bank of New York Mellon, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, State Street and U.S. Bancorp, have begun formal discussions with regulators about repaying their portion of the $700 billion rescue, said banking executives and a federal official. 
 New details emerged Tuesday about the repayment plans, including word that regulators would refuse to let a single major bank exit first, which might have given that institution considerable bragging rights. Instead, around June 8, the Federal Reserve expects to identify a group of banks that are ready to leave the bailout program, according to a Federal Reserve official, who was granted anonymity because of the Fed's policy against speaking publicly on such matters. The Treasury Department will handle the timing of the payments, this person said.
 Many ordinary Americans, angered by multibillion-dollar bailouts and what they see as excessive pay in the financial industry, might welcome news that taxpayers will get their money back sooner rather than later. But repaying the bailouts is not without risk. 
 While many big banks have, for the moment, stanched crippling losses, the banking industry still faces significant challenges. New troubles loom in commercial real estate and credit cards. By letting banks return bailout money, the government would cede some power over institutions that were at the center of the financial crisis. Banks, for their part, are eager to extricate themselves from heightened government oversight, including restrictions on their employees' compensation. 
 ''If a given bank repays the money and then in October, it needs the money again, that is going to be very scary,'' said Douglas J. Elliott, a fellow at the Brookings Institute and a former banker at JPMorgan Chase. 
 Bank chiefs have said for months that they would like to repay the money, provided through the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP. But it is only recently that several large banks entered into formal conversations with regulators. Executives at five banks discussed the issue for this article, but they were granted anonymity because they were not allowed to share their conversations with regulators.
 Rumors and leaks about prospective repayment plans seem to emerge almost daily. Some observers say banks may be trying to force the government's hand into allowing the repayments. 
 ''You're seeing more public tension between them,'' said Andrew Goldberg, the chairman of the corporate and financial practice at Burson-Marsteller, a public relations firm. ''This is a dialogue between two very different constituencies that operate with two different mind-sets -- the banks and the government -- and they intersect in the zone that we call TARP.''
 The tension also reflects old Wall Street rivalries that are once again coming to the fore -- if they receded at all. Goldman, for instance, has long been viewed as the most likely to pay off the money first. But rivals insist such a decision might be viewed as favoritism, given Goldman's ties to important federal officials, including the head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, William C. Dudley, who once worked at Goldman. While several small banks have repaid their bailout money, no large bank has done so. Citigroup is the only large bank so far that has decided to make the government a long-term shareholder. 
 In deciding which banks can repay bailout money, the government will potentially draw a line between winners and losers.
 One sticking point is whether to allow banks that return bailout money to continue using a government program that guarantees bank debt. Some banks might not be able to operate without that program.
 Regulators said recently that that before companies could return the money, they must demonstrate that they could issue debt without the government program. A person briefed on regulators' thinking said they were leaning toward allowing banks to continue using the debt program through October.
 Another issue is taxpayers' investment in the banks. The government owns warrants that give it the right to buy shares in the banks, and must now decide how much banks will have to pay to buy those warrants back. Stronger banks like Goldman favor a hefty price. Banks with less cash on hand want to expunge the warrants cheaply.
 Strong or weak, most big banks want to repay the money before the end of this year, so that they can pay out bonuses as they see fit.

HEADLINE: Tight Times Loosen Creativity

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
Even in the best of times Sony Holland had to hustle.
 Living in San Francisco, she got singing gigs wherever she could find them: concerts, corporate conventions, wine country gatherings, weddings, hotels or on the city streets. Now because of the economic downturn the company bookings have dried up, along with some of her regular bar engagements. 
 But Ms. Holland, 45, said she feels liberated, able to focus on the kind of music that she loves. Rather than serving up the usual Gershwin and Porter tunes typically requested at corporate events, she can sing Wainwright and Dylan.
 This singer's story is just one of hundreds that poured into The New York Times Web site in response to a request asking artists to share how the economy is affecting their lives and work. Perhaps most striking about the comments was the considerable number who were defiantly upbeat despite grim circumstances. Many artists echoed Ms. Holland, testifying that the recession had strengthened their commitment to their work or allowed them to concentrate on their art -- since the time spent on side jobs had diminished -- or had even been a source of creative inspiration. 
 Liz Fallon, 30, a visual artist in Portland, Me., started selling her paintings and drawings to private collectors about 10 years ago, when she was still in college. She has not sold an original work in almost a year. But in the Portland area, Ms. Fallon said, there seems to be a kind of artistic renaissance under way as various groups, like photography cooperatives and drawing collectives, form to connect creative professionals with one another. 
 ''As for myself, freed from the constraints of creating for a specific buyer,'' Ms. Fallon wrote, ''I've experienced my own surge in creativity and have been producing a great deal more than I used to. While it would be nice to still be getting paid for my work, the need to be more resourceful is having a beneficial effect on the arts community around me.''
 In a follow-up interview Ms. Fallon said she supports herself working as a customer-service representative for a direct-marketing firm, and that the lack of commissions has enabled her to pursue new projects, like illustrations of classic children's literature. 
 ''Nobody wants me to do anything, so I'm just doing what I want,'' she said. 
 There was a determination to many of the messages, a conviction to push through this rough patch and make the most of it. ''It is making me want to pursue my career as an artist more forcefully than ever,'' wrote Cadine Navarro, an artist in New York and Amsterdam. ''I feel that artists are well equipped to deal creatively with such situations and with a bit of persistence and optimism, can turn this recession into a point of strength.''
 Ms. Navarro added that she hoped the economic pressure would weed out ''market-oriented art that is being churned out by the bulk. Onward!''
 This sifting process, Ms. Navarro said in a later telephone call, has tested her own level of dedication. ''It's making me want to work harder,'' she said, ''to be spending more time with it and understand it's not an easy road and, yeah, I still believe in it.''
 There were many far more despairing responses. ''It is absolutely horrible,'' wrote Jamie Janos, a photographer in Cleveland. ''My assignments are at the lowest frequency they have ever been, budget cuts, layoffs and job losses are killing all of us freelancers.''
 Stephanie Sturton, 24, of Detroit said that she is more than $75,000 in debt for school loans; cannot find a part-time job, paying internship or full-time position anywhere in the arts and is currently working as a contractor for her alma mater and teaching after-school art classes. 
 ''The economy is so bad right now here in Detroit, Mich., that people are not buying art, they cannot afford it,'' she wrote. ''Therefore I am not making any money with my art. I am teaching pottery to mostly Detroit public schools which are closing.''
 ''I am a painter,'' she added. ''I do not even work with clay.'' 
 In a subsequent conversation Ms. Sturton said she has gone back to school at a community college to take business classes and steer herself toward a career change. ''It seems everyone wants interns who don't get paid or volunteers,'' she said. ''As much as I would love to volunteer, I need to pay my bills.''
 Karl Allen, 29, the former technical director of Performance Space 122, a performance space in Manhattan, said a reduction in Off Off Broadway productions has meant that sets turn over less frequently, which means less work for technical theater staff in New York. ''Those load-ins and strikes were the lifeblood of many people I know, and I was thinking that I would have plenty of opportunity to tap into it as needed,'' Mr. Allen wrote. ''But now, because of the decreased opportunity for work amongst the already (and always) struggling downtown theaters, I find myself applying for unemployment.''
 Mr. Allen later added that he has been kept afloat by odd jobs, doing some custom carpentry and apartment renovation for friends of friends. But he is rethinking the future. ''It's brought up a lot of questions about what I'm doing and whether I want to keep doing it,'' he said. ''I'm not really qualified to do much of anything else. I'd have to go back to school. I don't see the possibility of making a steady income in the near future. I don't think I can sustain it.
 ''I love it. The only thing that makes me sad is that I can't make a living right now.''
 Still, many of the dispatches from the arts world were infused with fortitude and resolve, as well as a sense of release. ''I'm proud that I've been able to live frugally and make work,'' wrote Alexander Conner, 22, a recent college graduate living in Philadelphia. He is an artist who works as a curator at Adaptation, a small arts exhibition organization. ''I don't have the ability to make everything I would like, nor do I have the ability to create works as complex as I might want due to financial constraints. However this time gives me the chance to refine my practice.
 ''I apply for grants, exhibitions and public arts programming, and I'm happy to wait. Nothing worth having doesn't take hard work and time to attain.''
 Elaborating over the phone, Mr. Conner said he earns his living working at the Philadelphia Museum of Art in the telemarketing department and as an admissions assistant in the student center. ''I get to check in school groups, get them ready for their tour guides, watch them talk about what they've seen,'' he said. ''It's lovely.''
 Mr. Conner shares an apartment with another artist. (His rent share is $475 a month.) Since he likes to cook, Mr. Conner shops for groceries at the local Italian market and makes most of his meals -- he even bakes his own bread -- which allows him to live on $12,000 a year. ''From an early age my parents taught me to live within my means,'' he said.
 Lance Horne, 31, a composer-lyricist and performer in New York who recently wrote for the one-night-only ''24 Hour Musicals,'' said he appreciated having more time to give to charitable causes. He flew to Los Angeles to play piano at the Glaad Media Awards and wrote a song about gay marriage for the Gay Men's Chorus of Los Angeles. ''I have more time to create,'' he wrote. ''I walked through Central Park twice this week and emerged with songs ready to go.''
 Mr. Horne, who also teaches voice, piano and composition, said in a subsequent interview that his private studentshave dropped by at least half, but that his spirits remain high. ''It's just changing around what I expect from the work,'' he said. ''It's not paying the bills the way it did in the past, but there is more joy in it.''
 He also said he believed the public was craving art in a new way, that ''they really have more time to see and feel things.''
 Diane Leon-Ferdico, 63, an abstract painter who lives in Elmhurst, Queens, pays the bills working as an administrator in the Hebrew and Judaic studies department at New York University. She said artists should have a backup plan but should not give up on their art. ''I've done it all my life and still have had a good balanced life,'' she wrote. ''This too shall pass. Artists must continue to create no matter what happens around them.''
 Ms. Leon-Ferdico later added that she is sometimes frustrated by spending so much time far removed from her art work. But then she looks on the walls of her office at her pictures of Alicante, Spain, where she has had an apartment since 1970. Her day job makes it possible for her to afford spending five weeks on the water every summer. ''The light is incredible there,'' she said. ''And the colors -- mostly oranges and blues, reds.'' 
 Libby Gilpatric, 68, wrote that her art is what allows her to weather times like these. ''Anxiety is there, but the act of painting relieves that more than not painting,'' she said.
 ''Along with the gallery owners, I remain hopeful that the tide will turn,'' Ms. Gilpatric added. ''The buyers will come, just as the leaves will sprout, the roses bud, the waves roll in every few minutes, every seventh one greater than the others.''

HEADLINE: Dealing Consumers a New Hand in Credit Cards

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER

 BODY:
At first glance, the sweeping credit card legislation that passed the Senate on Tuesday looks like a huge victory for consumers. The bill, after all, contains relief from penalty fees and certain interest rate spikes. 
 But for people who pay off their bills each month, and milk the card rewards programs for everything they're worth, there is some cause for concern. 
 For months now, the card companies have been threatening to cut rewards programs sharply to make up for revenue lost because of the new restrictions. 
 My guess, however, is that this talk is just so much saber-rattling. 
 Card companies want to make money, and big spenders help them do it, even if those cardholders do not go into debt.
 First, let's lay out the things we know will change because of the new legislation. The bill is chock-full of new rules, which will take effect at various points in the year after President Obama signs the final legislation. 
 There are new restrictions on when card companies can increase the interest rate on balances you've already run up. The bill says that banks generally must wait until you're 60 days late in making the minimum payment before applying a penalty interest rate to your existing debt. 
 While an earlier bill in the House of Representatives suggested less strict rules, House members have agreed to adopt the Senate version and intend to vote on it on Wednesday. On Tuesday, senators voted 90-5 in favor of the measure. 
 Card companies will have to give 45 days' notice before raising their interest rates. There's also a notice requirement for any significant change to a card's terms, which may keep companies from surprising customers who have been saving their loyalty points for years with huge alterations in rewards programs. 
 Banks must send out your bill no later than 21 days before the due date. They cannot send it with, say, 14 days to go, hoping that you won't get a check to the bank in time to avoid a late fee. 
 If the card company gets your payment by 5 p.m. on the due date, it's on time, according to the new rules. No more of this early morning deadline nonsense, which led to late fees for payments that arrived with the afternoon mail. Also, no more late fees if the due date is a Sunday or holiday and your payment doesn't arrive until a day later. 
 Let's say you're paying different interest rates on the debt on a single card -- one for a cash advance, another for a balance transfer and a third for new purchases. Now, when you make a payment over the minimum balance, banks will have to apply it to the highest-interest debt first. I bet you can guess how some banks used to handle this sort of situation. 
 Banks will need your permission before allowing you the ''privilege'' of spending more than your credit limit and paying a fat $39 fee for that privilege. The card companies should be ashamed that they needed a law to make this ''opt in'' requirement a reality. 
 If you're a student, it will become harder to get a credit card. No one under 21 can have a card unless a parent, legal guardian or spouse is the primary cardholder. Students with their own income can submit proof and ask for an exception to the co-signer requirement. 
 The senators, in an apparent endorsement of helicopter parenting, also require written permission from the parent, guardian or spousal co-signer for any increase in a card's credit line. You can read all the gory details through links to the Senate bill. 
 Hate gift cards? Me, too. There will be some helpful new rules regarding those absurd dormancy fees, which punish people who let the cards sit around before using them. 
 Under the Senate's rule, retailers and others that issue Visa, MasterCard, American Express or Discover gift cards or certificates will have to print explicit dormancy fee information on the card. Sellers of the cards will also have to inform the buyer of the fee. That's a smart twist, since the gift giver can then become aware of the noxious nature of the fee -- and elect to give cash or some other gift. 
 The bill also bans expiration dates on gift cards and certificates any sooner than five years after the card's original issue date. And the retailer or card issuer will have to print the terms of any expiration date in capital letters in at least 10-point type. Call it the fine print rule. 
 It will be fascinating to see which retailer or card issuer has the nerve, after having free use of your money for five years, to tell you it will lose the money altogether if you don't use up their gift card. I dare them to try.
 So will credit card companies kill reward programs or drastically scale most of them back? Of course not. 
 ''If you strip away the reward component of a credit card, it's essentially a commodity,'' said Rick Ferguson, editorial director at the loyalty marketing company LoyaltyOne. ''The reward is what gives it its personality. It works from a branding perspective as well as a mechanism to influence customer behavior and consolidate spending on a particular card.''
 That last part is crucial. People who spend a ton generate fees galore from merchants, and that money helps the card company stay in business. So you may soon see card companies giving away more goodies or lowering annual fees for people who hit certain spending thresholds each year. American Express already does this on a number of cards. 
 Also, keep in mind that you may have more control over what the card companies do to you than you may think. 
 If you don't like the new fees and other things that banks will soon be testing as they grapple with their new economic reality, then make some noise. Send a note to me at rlieber@nytimes.com, so I can write about the latest foolishness -- or consumer-friendly twist. At the very least, all of our complaints to the higher-ups at the banks may help persuade the companies to head in another direction. 
 ''Work your way up the chain,'' said Dennis C. Moroney, research director for bank cards at TowerGroup, a MasterCard-owned financial services consultant. After all, it may cost less to appease you than it would to replace you.

HEADLINE: A Health Care Exclusion

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Health Care, a Lesson in Pain,'' by David Leonhardt (Economic Scene, May 13): 
 As participants in the May 12 Senate Finance Committee round table on financing health care reform, we strongly disagree with Mr. Leonhardt's perception that the experts at the round table ''urged the senators to limit the tax deduction for employer-provided health insurance.'' In fact, we were clear: changing the employee tax exclusion risks disrupting the employer-sponsored health coverage and benefits workers value. 
 We also disagree with the characterization of the exclusion. Excluding the value of health care coverage from taxable compensation is highly valued by low- and moderate-income families because the benefit equates to a higher overall percentage of their income than for higher income workers. 
 The way to begin financing health care reform is by improving quality and affordability -- critical steps if we are to make the most of this historic opportunity.
 Gerald M. Shea James A. Klein Washington, May 13, 2009
 The writers are, respectively, assistant to the president for governmental affairs, A.F.L.-C.I.O.; and president of the American Benefits Council.

HEADLINE: Weak Construction Weighs on Investors

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stocks were narrowly mixed in light trading on Tuesday as a surprise drop in construction and a cautious outlook from the retailer Home Depot led energy and utility stocks to pare gains. 
 Wall Street has been trying to gauge the housing market for months as investors look for signs the economy is recovering. Stocks surged more than 3 percent on May 4 after unexpected increases in pending home sales and construction spending. 
 ''The housing number on the surface was horrible,'' said Alan Valdes, vice president at Hilliard Lyons in New York. But the whittling away of inventory will help prices eventually, Mr. Valdes said.
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 29.23 points, or 0.3 percent, to 8,474.85.
 Home Depot was the biggest loser in the Dow, falling $1.39, or 5.3 percent, to $24.63 after saying its markets were still under pressure. Profit at Home Depot, the nation's largest home improvement retailer, climbed 44 percent, better than expected, as the company took fewer charges.
 Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.58 points, or 0.2 percent, to 908.13, while the Nasdaq composite index rose 2.18 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,734.54.
 Rising prices for oil and materials lifted energy and commodity stocks. Rising prices are often seen as a sign that investors expect economic activity to increase and drive demand for raw materials. Peabody Energy increased 89 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $31.65, while the utility PPL rose $1.18, or 3.8 percent, to $31.94.
 Light, sweet crude oil rose 62 cents, to $59.65 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 Credit card companies fell after the Senate voted to prevent them from arbitrarily raising consumers' interest rates and charging many of the high fees that had become customary. American Express fell $1.34, or 5.1 percent, to $24.79, while Capital One Financial fell $1.16, or 4.5 percent, to $24.90.
 Bond prices were mixed. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 3/32, to 99, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was at 3.24 percent, up from 3.23 percent late Monday.
 Following are the results of the Treasury's auction Monday of four-week bills:

HEADLINE: A.I.G.'s Offering May Be Tough Sell

BYLINE: By JOHN FOLEY, ROBERT CYRAN and ROB COX

 BODY:
How about a new start in the East? The American International Group is hoping to float its Asian business, A.I.A., to put some blue sky between its Eastern hemisphere operations and its troubles back home. A.I.G., the recipient of about $180 billion of taxpayers' money, wants to raise enough cash to get back to something like normal. 
 An initial public offering of part of A.I.A. will do that. But while A.I.A. isn't a problem child, a stock offering may still be a tough sell. 
 There's one difficulty in particular -- A.I.G. already tried to sell a chunk of the business, and failed. In February, A.I.A. was on the block with a valuation of about $20 billion. That was approximately equal to its embedded value, a forward-looking benchmark for insurance valuation. Trade bidders, including Prudential of Britain and Manulife of Canada, failed to hit the desired price. 
 A.I.A.'s underwriters, therefore, needed to persuade a less informed public to pay up when insiders balked. Of course, stock markets were tanking then. But the economic headwinds are still strong. The financial crisis has put customers off of investment-linked insurance policies. 
 Chinese deposits and premiums fell 9 percent last year. Moreover, competition has led to a proliferation of products that offer guaranteed returns. That creates the risk of ''negative spread'' -- losses to the insurer -- if actual returns fall short. 
 Two things are on A.I.A.'s side. One is Chinese exuberance. Hong Kong in particular tends to be forgiving of listings with quirks -- there have been several this year. The other is that it's easy to tell a growth story for the development of underinsured and rapidly enriching Asia. 
 The timing and size of the offering are still nebulous. If a buyer can find the cash and the courage to offer a good price, A.I.G. could pull out. Either way, the real pity for A.I.G.'s primary constituents -- American taxpayers -- is that as a foreign company, A.I.G. can't list A.I.A. in Shanghai -- where the business was originally founded 90 years ago. 
 Shares of China's biggest insurance companies trade at 2 to 2.5 times their embedded value -- up to 150 percent more than A.I.G. is likely to get elsewhere in Asia.
 No Bill Needed
 The Shareholder Bill of Rights Act introduced in the Senate Tuesday proposes a raft of reforms for public companies, each worth supporting in its own right. The trouble is that shareholders are tackling most of these matters already. 
 The bill championed by Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, would put an end to staggered board elections, making proxy fights easier; and elections would need to be decided by majority votes.
 Companies would have to split the chairman and chief executive roles. Longstanding shareholders with stakes of more than 1 percent would be allowed to nominate directors to stand for election. And companies would hold advisory votes on executive pay. All these would increase the power of shareholders, so it's hard to argue with the bill's intentions. 
 But staggered boards have largely been eliminated among the most widely held corporations, and majority voting is already the norm at most large public companies. Shareholders are also increasingly demanding a split of the chairman and chief executive roles. Less than 20 percent of new chiefs in 2008 were also chairmen, down from 40 percent in 2004, according to Booz Allen Hamilton. 
 Moreover, the Securities and Exchange Commission is currently considering a rule change to give shareholders the right to propose directors. And about 150 companies are expected to adopt advisory ''say on pay'' votes this proxy season, almost three times more than in 2007, according to RiskMetrics. 
 So shareholders are already voting for desirable behavior, and companies are instituting it. There is, then, no apparent need for lawmakers to get involved. 
 Sure, after a year in which investors have seen nearly half of their investments wiped out, offering them a bill of rights sounds appealing. And by all means, legislators should support moves to improve shareholder democracy and give regulators the resources they need. But mandating through legislation simply risks transferring decision-making, and accountability, from company owners to Congress. After a year of unprecedented government bailouts, that's the wrong message to send to shareholders.

HEADLINE: In Britain, Scandal Flows From Modest Request

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS; Alan Cowell contributed reporting from Paris, Sarah Lyall from London, and Sharon Otterman from New York.

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
It began modestly enough back in 2005, when an American freelance writer and journalism teacher living in London, Heather Brooke, entered a request under Britain's newly promulgated freedom of information act for details of the expense claims of British members of Parliament. 
 Ms. Brooke's initiative to expose the politicians' greed, now led by one of the country's principal newspapers, The Daily Telegraph, has led to the biggest scandal to hit the House of Commons in decades. On Tuesday, the affair claimed its biggest victim yet when the speaker of the House of Commons, Michael Martin, became the first man to be ousted from that job in more than 300 years. 
 At one level, the scandal is a rich tale of politicians exploiting a lax system of expenses to claim a mind-boggling array of benefits. The claims have centered on so-called second-home allowances, which have allowed some members of Parliament to use nearly $40,000 a year in taxpayers' money to renovate and even sell properties for profit, while others have claimed monthly payments for mortgages that had already been paid off. Still others claimed ''necessities'' like the clearing of a country house moat, an electrical massage chair and even a Kit Kat bar. 
 At another level, it is a story of a newspaper, The Telegraph, which broke with a reputation as a stuffy publication favored by retired army colonels and blue-rinsed widows to seize what has turned out to be one of Britain's greatest scoops. As it has done so, it has stolen a march on its rivals in an overcrowded market where vanishing profits have intensified an already brutal rivalry.
 The Telegraph's editors, with daily banner headlines pummeling members of Parliament like a boxer raining blows on a helpless opponent, have declined to comment on reports that they paid about $140,000 for disks containing more than a million individual expense claims by members of Parliament over the past over the past four years. An unidentified whistleblower is said to have approached at least one of The Telegraph's rival publications, The Times of London, with an initial demand for $380,000.
 The timing of the scandal has played its part in fostering a public outcry with few precedents in parliamentary history. With Britain mired in its deepest recession since the 1930s, and tens of thousands losing jobs every month, it is hard to imagine a less auspicious moment, for the parliamentarians, to have their expenses exposed to public scrutiny.
 In response, they have made groveling apologies, waved reimbursement checks before television cameras and pledged to restore ''respect for Parliament.'' 
 For the time being, the scandal has overwhelmed every other story in Britain's media. The country's main television news channels offer live coverage of every twist and turn, while members of Parliament with dubious expense claims elbow their way past television crews and newspaper reporters mounting vigils outside their homes. Almost every hour brings new attempts to save careers with hand-on-heart apologies, tortuous explanations and promises of unrelenting modesty in future claims on the public purse.
 The two main political protagonists in the affair, Prime Minister Gordon Brown, leader of the Labor Party, and David Cameron, leader of the opposition Conservatives, have escalated their responses to the scandal day by day. Both have pledged that no member of Parliament shown to have made improper expense claims will be allowed to run as a candidate in a general election that must be held before June 2010. With at least 80 Parliament members already named by The Telegraph in its serialized chronicle of abuses, that could result in dozens of sitting members being denied the chance to run for re-election.
 Some have already decided to jump before they are pushed. Just as Mr. Martin was announcing his decision to quit Tuesday, the man who seems likely to become the unhappy icon of the scandal, Douglas Hogg, announced he would quit Parliament, and politics, at the end of its current term. Mr. Hogg, 64, a former Conservative cabinet minister and an aristocratic grandee, was the man who included a $3,400 claim for the clearing of his country house moat on a list of his expenses. 
 When The Telegraph first made the moat claim public, Mr. Hogg provided one of the more farcical moments of the scandal, leading a BBC television crew on a fast-paced march from his London home to the House of Commons. Wearing a flat cap of a kind favored at country steeplechases, and trying breathlessly to explain the bureaucratic intricacies of the expenses system, he avoided, for several minutes, responding directly to the BBC reporter's insistent questions about the moat. A few days later, under pressure from Mr. Cameron, he announced that he would repay the money claimed for the moat.
 Ms. Brooke, who entered the original request for the details of the expenses, has been a largely unheralded figure as the scandal has unfolded. She worked as an investigative reporter in Washington State and South Carolina before moving about 10 years ago to Britain, her parents' birthplace. Her request led to a protracted battle by the labor majority in Parliament to get a statutory exemption for their expense claims from the freedom of information act, a bid abandoned only in January. 
 The blustering efforts of Mr. Martin, the 63-year-old speaker, to block the publication of the expenses, and his announcement last week that he had asked Scotland Yard to open a criminal investigation into the leak to The Telegraph, appeared to have contributed to the decision by Mr. Brown to pressure him into resigning. That made him the first speaker forced out since 1695. Scotland Yard chose the moment of Mr. Martin's resignation to announce that it would not be investigating the leak.
 The expenses were to have been made public anyway by the House of Commons in July, after detailed redacting by officials that would have disguised some of the members' more controversial practices. One of these would have been the so-called flipping from one house or apartment to another in second-home claims, which enabled some members to buy and improve properties at the expense of the taxpayers and then sell them for handsome profits.
 For readers of The Telegraph, many of them staunch Conservatives, the revelations have carried an irony of their own. The day-by-day exposures have raised questions about the integrity of many Conservatives, as well as members of Labor and the Liberal Democrats, the third major party in the Commons, making for what some commentators have called an ''equal opportunity'' scandal.

HEADLINE: Despite Energy Reserves, Norway Slips Into Recession

BYLINE: By MATTHEW SALTMARSH

 BODY:
The slowdown in global economic activity has tipped Norway into recession, despite the country's deep oil reserves and strong budget position.
 Gross domestic product for Norway, excluding petroleum-related activity, contracted by 1 percent during the first quarter of 2009 from the previous quarter, when it declined 0.8 percent, Statistics Norway, the country's data agency, said on Tuesday. 
 That met the generally accepted definition of a recession -- two consecutive quarters of contractions -- for the first time since 1993. The economy of Norway expanded last year by 2.6 percent and by 6.1 percent in 2007.
 Including oil-related activity, the contraction during the first quarter of 2009 was a more moderate 0.4 percent.
 Continued investments in the energy industry have cushioned the effect of the global recession in Norway, which is not a member of the European Union. The state profits from oil and natural gas both through taxes imposed on production from its offshore fields and from direct investment in petroleum projects.
 But aspects of the financial crisis are starting to be felt in the country, which has 4.6 million people. Tighter access to loans and higher costs of credit are stalling business investments.
 Interest rate increases in 2007 and 2008, amid a significant buildup of personal debt, led to a damping of household consumption and residential investments, said Kyrre Aamdal, an analyst at DnB NOR, a financial services firm in Oslo.
 Norway's central bank has cut its benchmark interest rate to 1.5 percent, from 5.75 percent in October, and signaled the rate might fall as low as 1 percent later this year.
 The relatively high levels of personal indebtedness make the economy particularly responsive to rate moves, Mr. Aamdal said. 
 Last week, the government said it would spend more of its oil wealth this year to help stimulate the economy and create jobs. The coalition government said in a revised 2009 budget presentation that it would increase central government spending of oil revenue by 9.5 billion kroner ($1.48 billion), to about 130 billion kroner, roughly 15 percent of total government expenditures for 2009.
 Over all, the real underlying growth in government expenditures is now expected to be 6.75 percent in 2009, up from the 3.25 percent projection in the original budget for 2009.
 The government still enjoys a healthy budget surplus, and its ledger is virtually free of debt.
 The decline in Norwegian growth is still moderate compared with the contractions among other European economies. By comparison, the American economy, in recession since December 2007, contracted at an annual rate of 6.1 percent in the first quarter.

HEADLINE: Japan's Economic Slide in Quarter Sets Record

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
Japan's economy contracted at the fastest pace since 1955 as exports plunged and companies slashed production, the government reported Wednesday.
 Japan's real gross domestic product, or the total value of the nation's goods and services, shrank at an annual pace of 15.2 percent in the January-March period. 
 The result represents the steepest decline since Japan began compiling G.D.P. statistics more than five decades ago. It also marks the fourth straight quarter of decline after the G.D.P.fell 12.1 percent in the October-December period.
 On a quarterly basis, G.D.P.fell 4.0 percent from the previous three-month period, according to the Cabinet Office's preliminary data.
 Japan's first-quarter results were markedly worse than other major economies, outpacing the euro zone's 2.5 percent quarterly decline and a 1.6 percent contraction in the United States.
 The world's second biggest economy relied heavily on the rest of the world to buy its cars and gadgets to drive economic growth. Like the rest of Asia, it has been pummeled by the collapse in global demand set off last year by the United States financial crisis.
 Japan's exports plummeted a record 26 percent in the fourth quarter from the third quarter, the government said.
 In response, major exporters such as Toyota and Sony have moved quickly to adjust by reducing shifts, suspending factory lines and announcing thousands of job cuts over the past few months.
 Capital expenditure -- business investment in factories and equipment -- fell 10.4 percent from the previous quarter, while consumer spending slipped 1.1 percent.
 Recent signs, however, point toward a brighter outlook for this quarter.
 The decline in exports is slowing, and with companies aggressively trimming inventories, factories are beginning to boost production. Economists say that efforts by both the public and private sectors are also starting to pay off.
 The government is trying to spark a turnaround with massive public spending. Its newest $150 billion stimulus package includes incentives for consumers to buy environmentally friendly appliances and cars, as well as help for the unemployed and small businesses.
 ''We think January-March will be recognized as marking the bottom in the economy for the time being,'' said Masayuki Kichikawa, chief economist for Bank of America-Merrill Lynch in Tokyo, in a recent report.

HEADLINE: At $2.3 Billion, This Mall Could Be Too Big to Fail

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. 

 BODY:
The chair lifts, fans and snow guns are in place, which means that the 800-foot indoor ski slope, the only one in the country, is ready to be covered with manufactured snow. The floor tiles, including some with intricate mosaic patterns and others that sparkle like fireflies, have been laid. The anchor restaurant, a Cheesecake Factory, looks as if it could be welcoming customers before long. 
 But although its common areas are nearly completed, the 2.4-million-square-foot Meadowlands Xanadu is eerily quiet. 
 The opening of the $2.3 billion entertainment-and-shopping center, originally scheduled for last November and then postponed until this summer, has been delayed again until some unspecified date next year. Work has slowed considerably at the project, which occupies state-owned land in the Meadowlands Sports Complex, at the intersection of Route 3 and Interstate 95, where the Giants and Jets are building a football stadium. 
 Even when the economy was robust, some New Jersey politicians and many Wall Street analysts derided Xanadu as a bloated extravaganza. Its ballooning cost helped bring down its original sponsor, the Mills Corporation, which was sold in 2007 to the Simon Property Group. A few months before that sale, private investors led by Colony Capital of Los Angeles took over the project. 
 Now, however, Meadowlands Xanadu, like many other projects, is enmeshed in the fallout from the banking crisis. In March, the developers accused one of its construction lenders, Xanadu Mezz Holdings, described in court papers as ''a nonbankrupt affiliate of Lehman Brothers Inc.,'' of defaulting on its loan obligations in recent months. The default ''has caused, and is likely to continue to cause, substantial and irreparable damage'' to the developers and could threaten the entire project, the complaint said. By this week, Xanadu was $22.9 million short, according to a motion filed on Monday. 
 Carl J. Goldberg, chairman of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, which controls the site, said his agency was working with Colony Capital to try to find another lender, a difficult proposition given the credit squeeze. Another option would be ''some rearrangement of the debt'' with additional capital coming from Colony and its partners, Mr. Goldberg said.
 Xanadu Mezz Holdings has sought to have the case dismissed on technical grounds by claiming it was not bound by the contract provisions it is accused of violating. Describing that motion as ''patently frivolous,'' lawyers for the developers say that the Lehman affiliate had agreed to lend the project $208 million, or 20 percent of the total. Of that sum, $125 million has yet to be delivered. Among the project's primary lenders are Credit Suisse and Capmark. 
 Neither Colony nor Lehman would discuss the lawsuit.
 Financing is not the project's only obstacle. In the midst of what Colliers International, a real estate services company, recently described as ''the most challenging retail landscape of the past 50 years,'' Meadowlands Xanadu is still seeking tenants.
 That task is more challenging now that tenants have the upper hand. National retailers are demanding rent reductions or shorter lease terms and are closing more stores than they are opening. Even more ominously, sales are slipping faster in high-quality malls than in lesser ones, according to Green Street Advisors, a Newport Beach, Calif., company that specializes in real estate investment trusts. Another round of retail bankruptcies is expected this summer, Green Street said.
 Because of the legal battle and the construction delay, Real Capital Analytics, a research company that tracks real estate investments, has listed Meadowlands Xanadu as the largest of $9.2 billion worth of troubled assets in the New York area. But Dan Fasulo, a managing director of the research group, said he did not think the center would be suspended indefinitely. ''In my opinion, the project is too big to fail at this point and will be completed,'' he said.
 Laurence C. Siegel, the former chief executive of Mills, who remains the creative force behind the project as president of Meadowlands Xanadu, ascribed the slowdown in construction to a desire by the anchor tenants to postpone opening until the economy began to recover. The sporting goods chain Cabela's announced in March that it would not open its 202,000-square-foot store before next spring. ''It was crazy to go at the burn rate we were going if we were going to delay the project until next year, anyway,'' Mr. Siegel said last week. ''This was the more prudent thing to do.'' 
 During a recent fast-paced tour of the project, Mr. Siegel, 56, showed off the common areas, which he described as ''88 percent'' complete. The varied flooring and eye-catching lighting effects help distinguish the building's five sections. Bright multihued light-emitting diodes mark the section devoted to young people, for example, and fluorescent lighting in soft colors washes over the fashion section. Other sections are dedicated to sports, entertainment and the home.
 Though the industrial-looking exterior of the project has been widely attacked, retail specialists have praised the interior. ''It's a lot more dramatic and exciting on the inside than on the outside,'' said Richard J. Brunelli, the president of R. J. Brunelli & Company, a retail brokerage firm in Old Bridge, N.J. 
 Mr. Siegel said that the project was 70 percent leased, but he declined to identify most of the tenants apart from the anchors. Mr. Brunelli said it was likely that many leases could be nullified or modified if the project opened without the expected mix of tenants.
 Mr. Siegel did disclose a few fresh names, however: the trendy Spanish clothing retailers Zara and Mango, and Deichmann, a German footwear chain, which plans to open a 20,000-foot store, he said. Previously announced tenants include the clothing chains Forever 21, H&M and Children's Place; Muvico, a movie theater chain; a Zeytinia Gourmet Market; and activities like a children's museum called Wonder Works and a Legoland Discovery Center.
 Casting a wide net, Mr. Siegel said he was going after South American and European brands that were likely to be unfamiliar to most American shoppers. As many domestic retailers look for opportunities overseas, so too are foreign retailers chasing low rents and favorable deals in the United States, he said. 
 While Xanadu is stalled, other projects at the Meadowlands are nearing completion. The football stadium will open in 2010. Starting in August, a train will whisk visitors from Manhattan to the Meadowlands in 23 minutes. 
 But last month, the automobile dealer who tried to bring a minor-league baseball park to the Meadowlands abandoned that effort, saying the initial $20 million cost had doubled. ''The Bergen Cliff Hawks were a point in time, and that point has passed,'' said Steve Kalafer, who owns the Somerset Patriots, an Atlantic League team.
 Despite Xanadu's problems, Mr. Goldberg of the sports authority said there was no danger that it would fail. ''This horse has left the barn,'' he said. ''It's far too near completion. The only questions are when will it open, and what will the tenant mix look like.''
 David M. Fick, a managing director at Stifel Nicolaus & Company in Baltimore, who was chief financial officer for Mills in the early 1990s, predicted that Xanadu would ultimately be a tourist destination.
 ''Larry creates leading-edge projects that are very architecturally special,'' he said. ''A project like that goes with a time risk, though. You don't know what economy is going to look like when it is finished.''

HEADLINE: Want to Send a Document to Your Kindle? 15 Cents, Please

BYLINE: By CHRIS WALTERS

 BODY:
When Amazon first introduced its Kindle e-book device over a year ago, it waived its 10-cent fee for letting you e-mail your own text and PDF documents to Amazon so that they could be wirelessly sent to the Kindle. Blame it on the economy, or on the fact that more people are taking advantage of the service, but that perk came to an end on May 4 -- and what's more, the fee has increased to 15 cents a megabyte, rounded up, the equivalent of sending a text message. 
 Fortunately, Amazon's service is optional. You can avoid the fee altogether if you convert your documents yourself and upload them to your Kindle via the oft-neglected U.S.B. cable that came with the device.
Two stand-alone programs, Calibre and Stanza, can convert most document types to a format that the Kindle can display. Both are free and work on Mac and Windows; Calibre even offers a Linux version. Stanza (which coincidentally is now owned by Amazon) can even convert your documents to MP3 audio files if you use a Mac.
 You can also convert documents using the free Mobipocket eBook Creator from Mobipocket (another company now owned by Amazon), but it's for Windows only.
 If you'd rather let Amazon do the conversion for you, change the e-mail address you currently use to forward documents to your Kindle. For example, if your current address is ''name''@kindle.com, change it to ''name''@free.kindle.com, and the converted files will be sent back to you instead of forwarded on to your device. From there, you can send it to your Kindle via the U.S.B. connection.
 It's also good to remember that documents saved as TXT files can be read by the Kindle without conversion. You can simply copy those over to your device via U.S.B. and bypass Amazon and the stand-alone programs. (Also worth noting: the Kindle DX will read PDF files natively, but the previous two Kindle models will not.)
 Fifteen cents isn't going to break the bank for the occasional conversion, but if you're a frequent user of the service you might want to keep the Kindle's U.S.B. cable handy and start uploading the documents yourself.

HEADLINE: New York Accuses 2 Debt Settlement Firms of Fraud

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD

 BODY:
The New York attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, sued two large debt settlement companies Tuesday, saying they had engaged in fraudulent and deceptive business practices and false advertising.
 The suits seek to enjoin the companies, Nationwide Asset Services and Credit Solutions of America, from many of their business practices, including charging customers before any settlement work is done. They also seek restitution and damages for dissatisfied customers. 
 ''These companies claim to be the light at the end of the tunnel, but time after time they have shown that they only add to the burdens of Americans dealing with debt,'' Mr. Cuomo said in a statement. 
 Credit Solutions enrolled 18,000 customers in New York State in the last five years, earning $17 million in fees, but settled the debts of fewer than 2,000 of them, the attorney general said. 
 Nationwide signed up 1,981 New York residents in three years, the suit against it says, but only 64 completed the program. Twenty-seven of those ended up paying more than they originally owed because of Nationwide's fees, the suit alleges.
 Mark Walling, a lawyer for Phoenix-based Nationwide, said he had not seen the suit. ''My client denies any wrongdoing,'' he said.
 Credit Solutions, based in Richardson, Tex., disputed liability over the complaints and practices in the suit, saying in a statement that they had largely occurred when the company was under different ownership in 2007. 
 The suits are part of an effort by Mr. Cuomo to control the debt settlement industry, which has mushroomed as the economy has worsened. This month he sent subpoenas to 15 major companies that do settlements, seeking details about business practices.
 As unemployment rises, many people can no longer afford to pay the minimum on their credit cards. The Federal Reserve said this week that delinquencies rose in the first quarter to 6.5 percent, the highest since it began tracking them in 1991. Citigroup and Wells Fargo said April defaults were more than 10 percent. 
 For consumers on the verge of default, debt settlement companies promise relief. In voluminous radio and late-night television advertisements, the companies say they can shrink those onerous balances by striking deals with creditors.
 Credit Solutions, which was founded in 2003 by an entrepreneur named Doug Van Arsdale, initially said it could shrink a customer's credit card debt by as much as 75 percent. ''There's more to life than paying bills,'' its Web site said, promising ''honest and sincere'' evaluations. 
 Such claims powered it to a leading position in the industry. Mr. Van Arsdale said he sold the company in December 2006, but, unhappy with how it was being run, bought it back a year later. The Web site now says the company has served 200,000 people with a combined debt of $2.25 billion. 
 An early flashpoint was its practice of charging, in advance, a fee of 15 percent of the customer's total enrolled debt. Credit Solutions had to refund $700,000 to customers in South Carolina in 2007 after the state accused it of violating local credit counseling laws. 
 It had to pay $588,000 to Idaho customers in 2008 for operating in the state without a license. In March, the Texas attorney general sued Credit Solutions, alleging ''false, deceptive and misleading acts.''
 The Better Business Bureau of Dallas gives Credit Solutions a grade of F, citing 1,679 complaints against the company. 
 A Credit Solutions spokeswoman, Genie Hayes, called that number relatively small, ''given the difficulty and length of the settlement process.'' She said all the complaints had been resolved except for six cases where the consumers had disappeared.
 Typically, debt settlement companies tell consumers to stop paying any amount on their bills and start accumulating money in a special account. Eventually, the company promises, it will use that money to negotiate settlements with creditors.
 But Mr. Cuomo contends that many people leave the Credit Solutions program because it is too hard for them to save, especially after paying the company's fees. Even when they stick it out, the promised deals often do not materialize. ''Credit Solutions frequently fails to obtain settlement offers at all,'' the suit says. 
 Evelyn Mazzella, who lives in Westchester County, signed up with Credit Solutions after a friend recommended it. ''I ended up paying them a couple of thousand dollars, but they only settled one card,'' with Best Buy electronics, she said. She complained to the attorney general's office.
 Credit Solutions used to send customers a 60-item list of ways to raise money. First is ''refinance home,'' followed by ''get a second mortgage'' -- the two things that got many people in over their heads in the first place. Among the other tips are: ''Baby sit,'' ''Sell plasma,'' ''Ask for raise,'' ''Get off the station before your usual stop and walk,'' ''Cut down your drinking,'' ''Drink tap water,'' ''Buy frozen.''
 Nationwide Asset is less known than Credit Solutions. Doreen and Barry Melton, a retired couple who live in Lewiston, N.Y., became clients in 2007. They had about 13 credit cards, Mrs. Melton estimates. After Mr. Melton had back surgery, then eye surgery, then heart surgery, the bills got out of hand.
 ''I thought settlement was an answer to my prayers,'' said Mrs. Melton, who appeared Tuesday at a news conference with Mr. Cuomo in Buffalo. ''They were going to take care of all my debt in a year and a half.''
 Before she knew it, however, she had paid Nationwide $1,400, and then was paying $56.65 monthly. The company told her not to answer the phone, which only redoubled the creditors' zeal. ''Our phone was ringing constantly from morning to 9 or 10 at night,'' she said.
 A few bills were settled, and each time Nationwide charged her another fee. Most were not settled. Now, she said, ''our credit is destroyed.''

HEADLINE: Charter Companies Flying to Cuba Thrive Despite Complaints

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE; Oscar Hidalgo contributed reporting.

DATELINE: MIAMI 

 BODY:
The crowd of Cuban-Americans pressing against the airport ticket counter scorned those on the other side. Only a handful of American charter companies have landing rights in Cuba, and with the new White House policy letting Cuban-Americans visit relatives there as often as they want, ticket prices have become political. 
 ''I paid $600 for a 45-minute flight,'' said Carelis Sabatela, in loud Spanish, before checking in with a cart of heavy luggage. ''It's very high, super excessive.'' 
 Like many in line, she called for more competition, but as the current boom in reservations shows, this is not a normal business. Who flies and how much they charge is intimately tied to the 50-year feud between Cuba and the United States. Experts describe these charter companies as byproducts of a dysfunctional back-and-forth that has not ended -- and that now promises to provide millions of dollars in profit to a politically savvy few. 
 ''The system exists solely because the relationship between Cuba and the United States doesn't exist in its normal form,'' said John S. Kavulich II, a senior policy adviser for the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, a nonpartisan group that tracks trade activity in Cuba. ''You have an abnormal service environment directly because of abnormal relations.''
 Today's charter companies began in the late 1970s during a period of warming relations, and most owners figured that their role would be temporary. The companies survived not just because Fidel Castro and the American embargo kept larger carriers out; many of the owners have also played both sides, deploying money and favors under the cover of dual identities that let them connect with Cuban leaders one minute, Americans the next. 
 John Cabanas, of C&T Charters, is perhaps the least known but the most powerful owner in a group that includes Vivian Mannerud, who followed her father into the business after he was convicted in the 1980s of ''trading with the enemy,'' in part for taking four Pepsi machines to Cuba; and Francisco Aruca, owner of Marazul Charters, who sneaked out of a Castro-run prison dressed as a child, but now praises Cuba on his Miami radio show. 
 A large man, quick to laugh and partial to linen Guayaberas with a gold plane pinned to the collar, Mr. Cabanas, 66, grew up in Key West, Fla., but spent 28 years in Cuba. He says his company is the largest of the seven or eight that fly there regularly. 
 Certainly since the new White House policy was announced last month, business is booming. ''We used to send 15,000, 16,000 people a year,'' Mr. Cabanas said. ''Now I'll probably handle 40,000 or 50,000.''
 He insists that his prices -- though at least double the cost of flying to the Bahamas -- are fair when seen in context. In his view, customers like Ms. Sabatela, who was traveling on a C&T flight to Camaguey, fail to appreciate the industry's challenges.
 The past decade has been especially tough. The cost of fuel and jet rentals have increased while the Bush administration's tighter travel restrictions in 2004 halved the number of legal American visitors from a peak of 135,000 in 2000, according to the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council. The government has also demanded reams of paperwork from the charter operators, proving that they have complied with various rules -- which led in part to a $125,000 penalty settlement that C&T paid in 1999. 
 The Cuban government has demands as well: it prohibits the charters from hiring in Cuba, and charges $100 to $133 per passenger for landing rights, baggage claim and other services.
 Mr. Cabanas admits that the industry is ''very controlled.'' 
 ''My business is business,'' he said. ''But it depends on politics.''
 His office illustrates the point. In a back conference room, photographs on the walls show him with four very different leaders: Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Fidel Castro and Alvaro Uribe, the president of Colombia. 
 Since returning to Florida in the late '90s, Mr. Cabanas has also spread more than $145,000 in campaign donations across the political spectrum. ''Right now, I support Barack Obama,'' he said, ''even though I'm a Republican.'' 
 Mr. Cabanas had just come from a Cinco de Mayo party at the White House, but his connections and charm have done nothing to alter the controversial basics of his business. 
 The industry ''is in essence a protected monopoly,'' Mr. Kavulich said. ''There are a finite number of people in the marketplace, and you have to have the Cuban government's authorization.'' 
 Cuban officials, he said, want as few companies as possible, and ''if they can't Google you and find you've opposed the commercial, economic or political position of the United States, you're not likely to do any business.'' 
 That means approved operators earn a lot during open moments. A recent poll by Bendixen and Associates found that about 240,000 Cuban-Americans plan to travel to Cuba by the end of 2010. 
 If round-trip tickets continue to hover around $500, with a 10 percent markup, that would be around $12 million in profit.
 In interviews, several charter operators described their flights as humanitarian and insisted that politics did not enter into conversations with Cuban officials.
 They all oppose the embargo, which puts them squarely in line with the stated desire of Cuban officials, but also with a growing swath of the 1.2 million Cuban-Americans in the United States. 
 And yet, many here see the companies' owners as relics of a past they would like to get beyond. For Cubans, the charters' prices and profits are pinpricks in a wound that has not healed. 
 Conservatives still accuse the charters of being collaborators.
 ''They are a virtual cartel that control the travel sector from the U.S. to Cuba, charging egregious fees in collusion with Cuban authorities,'' said Mauricio Claver Carone, director of the U.S.-Cuba Democracy PAC in Washington. 
 More moderate Cuban-Americans are only slightly kinder. 
 ''Do they charge more than they should? They do,'' said Andy S. Gomez, a senior fellow at the Institute for Cuban and Cuban-American Studies at the University of Miami. ''Are there any other alternatives? None.''
 Well, not yet, but momentum for broader changes in Cuba policy has been building. Last week, Orbitz, the online travel company, began offering a $100 coupon for a vacation in Cuba to everyone who signed an online petition urging leaders in the United States to give all Americans the freedom to visit.
 Jose Fernandez, one of the dozens waiting here to board a C&T flight to Cuba, said he would welcome new alternatives. ''The prices,'' Mr. Fernandez said, ''are out of balance with the moment.''

HEADLINE: Albany's April Revenue Fell 44% From 2008

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
Less than two months into the state's fiscal year, revenue collections are about half of what they were last year, according to a report issued by the state comptroller on Tuesday.
 The findings reinforced what seemed to be a foregone conclusion almost as soon as Gov. David A. Paterson and legislative leaders agreed last month to the state's $131 billion budget: Lawmakers will need to return to Albany at some point this year to make further cuts.
 The comptroller's report said the state collected $4.8 billion in revenue in April, compared with $8.6 billion collected in April 2008, a 44 percent decline. 
 Collections missed the revenue forecast the governor's office had issued just three weeks ago by nearly a quarter of a billion dollars.
 The comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli, said that while it was too soon to say for certain whether the budget would have to be reopened, the outlook was not encouraging.
 ''If you look at the most optimistic projections, which call for a rebound in the third or fourth quarter, it's going be a very tight budget picture,'' he said. ''Until we start to see some upturn in overall economic activity, the expectation should be that revenues are going to continue to be off.''
 The revenue numbers, which include income taxes the state collected around the April 15 deadline, reflect the toll the recession has taken on New Yorkers' personal finances. The state collected $2.9 billion in personal income taxes in April, a 49 percent decline from April 2008.
 The numbers do not reflect a vast majority of the new and increased taxes and fees approved in the budget that will finance state operations through next winter, a fact the governor's Division of the Budget pointed out on Tuesday. The state began assessing higher personal income taxes on the highest-earning New Yorkers at the beginning of May, and that revenue will not begin showing up on the balance sheets until late May or early June. All told, the new and higher taxes and fees are expected to bring in more than $5 billion a year. 
 A spokesman for the Budget Division, Jeffrey Gordon, said the state's finances were not as perilous as the comptroller's report suggested, in part because adjustments to spending had been made in anticipation of the drop in revenue.
 ''The state's finances are in line with the fiscal plan, since decreases in projected revenues were largely offset by decreases in spending,'' Mr. Gordon said.
 The budget the Democratic-controlled Legislature enacted and Mr. Paterson signed was widely criticized by Republicans and independent budget analysts as bloated and heavily reliant on temporary sources of revenue at a time when, they asserted, the state should be exercising fiscal discipline. Spending for 2009-10 rose more than 9 percent over the previous year when several billion dollars in federal stimulus money are included.
 With his poll numbers at historic lows, Mr. Paterson has tried to position himself anew as a fiscal conservative. He recently called for a plan that would set mandatory limits on state spending. That plan, however, does not appear to be gaining much traction in the Legislature.
 Reacting to Mr. DiNapoli's report, Democrats said that it was still far too early to tell whether the impact of the federal stimulus legislation was having any effect on the state treasury's bottom line.
 ''I think it would be unfair to say that in April's numbers you can see the trend for the year,'' said Senator Liz Krueger, vice chairwoman of the Senate Finance Committee. ''The bad news, of course, is that we're down dramatically.''

HEADLINE: Saks Posts Loss; TJX, a Discounter, Shows a Profit

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
The widening gulf between luxury and discount retailers could not have been more obvious on Tuesday. Saks posted a first-quarter loss while the TJX Companies -- which owns the T. J. Maxx and Marshalls chains -- reported the strongest quarterly results ever.
 Saks, the upscale department store chain that sells $700 shoes and $1,000 handbags, reported a loss of $5.1 million, or 4 cents a share, in contrast to a profit of $17.3 million, or 12 cents a share, for the period a year ago. Sales at stores open at least a year declined 27.6 percent in the first quarter, which ended May 2. 
 While Saks has already made significant cost cuts, it plans to become even leaner. Beginning in June, many salaried employees will take 3 to 7 percent pay cuts, including Stephen I. Sadove, chairman and chief executive, and Ronald L. Frasch, president and chief merchandising officer. 
 Mr. Sadove told investors Tuesday that he was reinventing the way Saks does business: lowering inventory and capital expenditures, offering a wider range of prices within brands, getting rid of unprofitable brands and introducing more exclusive brands. Saks is also taking a cue from Macy's, and creating local marketing plans for its full-price stores to better serve customers in different regions. 
 ''The dire environment that we've been in has changed the culture of this company,'' Mr. Sadove said in a conference call.
 In stark contrast to Saks's results, the TJX Companies made a profit of $209 million, or 49 cents a share, compared with $193.8 million, or 43 cents a share, a year ago. Sales at stores open at least a year rose 2 percent for the quarter. And customer traffic was up, bucking industry trends. 
 Luxury chains have endured the greatest pain in this economy as consumers cut back on spending. What people are shopping for nowadays can be summed up in a word: necessities. 
 Sales trends at Home Depot, the giant home improvement chain, which also reported earnings on Tuesday, underscored the trend. None of the retailer's major merchandise departments had year-over-year growth, but in a conference call with investors, Home Depot executives said there was some strength in certain product categories, like basic repair and maintenance.
 Outdoor projects, like landscaping, also fared well, as did sales of vegetables and herbs. (Executives suggested more consumers are growing their own food.) Better-performing categories included repair and maintenance products like caulk and water heaters; basic remodeling and decor products like interior paint, carpet and window coverings; and safety and security-related products. 
 ''We believe tougher economic times have made consumers focus on safety,'' Craig Menear, the company's executive vice president for merchandising, said during a conference call. ''Categories like door locks and exterior security lighting performed better than the company average.''
 For the three months that ended May 3, Home Depot made a profit of $514 million, or 30 cents a share, in contrast to a profit of $356 million, or 21 cents a share, for the period a year ago. Same-store sales fell 10.2 percent.
 At Saks, sales at the flagship store in Manhattan were worse than sales at other stores, which was particularly hard on the retailer because the flagship accounts for about 20 percent of the company's business. Saks's Internet business also fell: down 14.6 percent for the quarter, in contrast to an increase of more than 40 percent a year ago.
 On Monday, P. Schoenfeld Asset Management, which owns 1.5 percent of Saks and thinks the retailer has not performed as well as its competitors, urged shareholders to vote against the way the company elects directors, calling for directors to be elected annually, rather than serving staggered terms. 
 While Saks had not been expected to report a profit in the quarter, given the months of double-digit sales declines, its results were not as bad as analysts were expecting. Some praised the chain for how it is managing in the downturn. And same-store sales at the company's Off 5th discount stores showed ''relative strength,'' Saks said.
 All of that was enough to send Saks shares up 18 percent, or 73 cents, on Tuesday to close at $4.81. TJX shares rose almost 4 percent, or $1.09, to close at $29.03. Home Depot shares fell more than 5 percent, or $1.39, to close at $24.63.

HEADLINE: The Earth Wins One

 BODY:
The nationwide automobile mileage and emissions standards announced by President Obama on Tuesday represent a huge step forward in the effort to limit greenhouse gases and reduce America's dependence on foreign oil. They also represent a departure from the Bush administration's indifference on these issues and an important down payment on Mr. Obama's pledge to fashion an aggressive and imaginative energy policy. 
 The standards, forged after weeks of negotiations orchestrated by Carol Browner, the White House coordinator on energy and environmental matters, may also mark the end of decades of wearying, unproductive legal and political combat between the automobile industry and environmentalists. 
 Sharing the occasion with Mr. Obama were automobile executives and activists. Also in attendance were two governors on different sides of the issue -- Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, whose state had been fighting to impose its own, much stricter emissions standards on cars and trucks, and Gov. Jennifer Granholm of Michigan, who had worried that tough standards could kill an industry already on life support. 
 The agreement will raise fuel-efficiency standards to 35.5 miles per gallon by 2016 -- a 40 percent increase over today's 25 m.p.g. standard and a 30 percent increase over today's actual fleetwide mileage of almost 28 m.p.g. And for the first time, it will impose limits on tailpipe greenhouse gas emissions from cars and light trucks. The goal, roughly speaking, is to reduce greenhouse emissions from new cars and trucks by nearly one-third by 2016. Happily for Mr. Schwarzenegger, this will achieve, on a national basis, the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles called for in California's landmark clean car program. California had repeatedly asked the Bush administration for the federal waiver it needed (and had never before been denied) to enforce its own rules, only to be rebuffed. 
 Odd as it may seem, California's triumph may also end up being a boon to the beleaguered automakers.
 To survive, Detroit is clearly going to have to make more fuel-efficient cars. And since Mr. Obama would surely have granted California the waiver it needed, Detroit would have been confronted with two sets of emissions standards: tough ones in California and the states that opted into California's program; easier standards elsewhere. The new rule provides a single national efficiency standard as well as the regulatory certainty that the automakers need to plan their production schedules. 
 With this deal, America also wins back a bit of energy independence. But the biggest winner could be the atmosphere. Vehicles account for more than one-quarter of greenhouse gas emissions in this country.
 The new standards are not a substitute for the kind of comprehensive economywide emissions cap now under consideration in the House. They are, though, an important and necessary start.

HEADLINE: California Voters Reject Budget Measures

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
A smattering of California voters on Tuesday soundly rejected five ballot measures designed to keep the state solvent through the rest of the year.
 The results dealt a severe setback to the state's fragile fiscal structure and to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and the state legislators who cobbled together the measures as part of a last-minute budget deal passed in February.
The measures, which would have prolonged tax increases, capped state spending, earmarked money for education and involved the state in a complex borrowing scheme against its lottery, were rejected by roughly 60 percent of those who voted. The failure of the measures, combined with falling revenues since the state passed its budget, leaves California with a $21 billion new hole to fill, while foreclosure rates and unemployment remain vexing problems here. 
 ''Tonight we have heard from the voters, and I respect the will of the people who are frustrated with the dysfunction in our budget system,'' Governor. Schwarzenegger said in a prepared statement. ''Now we must move forward from this point to begin to address our fiscal crisis with constructive solutions,'' Mr. Schwarzenegger said.
 While the governor was a strong supporter of all the measures, he was not the public face of the effort, as he was in 2005 when he took on the budget issues, and well as the state's unions, in another failed effort at the ballot box. This time the Republican governor let teachers and firefighters do his talking for him in advertisements, and indeed was not even in the state the day of the vote. 
 Instead, he was a guest of President Barack Obama at the White House, where the president was announcing tough new federal standards on automobile emissions that emulate California's environmental standards. He updated his Twitter account through out the day (''Just landed in DC. Look forward to updating you tomorrow, hopefully with pictures or video'') but made nary a mention of the propositions there. 
 The one measure to pass, which would prevent legislators and statewide constitutional officers, including the governor, from receiving pay rises in years when the state is running a deficit, was approved by more than 75 percent of those who cast ballots, demonstrating the overwhelming disgust many Californians say in polls that they feel toward elected officials in a time of deep budget paralysis. 
 The central measure, Proposition 1A, would have increased the state's rainy-day fund but also restrict spending in future years, and extend several temporary taxes. Proposition 1B, which was connected to 1A, would have required $9.3 billion to be paid to education to make up for shortfalls in spending levels set by a voter-approved proposition in 1988. Voters indicated in polls earlier this month that they had a distaste for protracted taxes, caps on spending during inflation periods and general legislative and gubernatorial will. 
 The other failing propositions were 1E, which would have redirected money guaranteed for mental health services to the state's general fund; 1D, a similar measure using money earmarked for early childhood programs; and 1C, which would have modernized the state lottery and permitted the state to borrow from future profits.
 But voters -- roughly 10 percent of those registered, according to midday figures -- seemed to have lost patience with ideas cooked up by legislators to fix the state's perpetual budget imbalances. The governor and lawmakers will now be forced to debate yet again what methods will be used to set the balance sheet right and vote on new measures to cut spending. Those proposed measures will be draconian and politically difficult, including large education cuts and reductions in prison sentences. 
 ''We face a staggering $21.3 billion deficit and in order to prevent a fiscal disaster, Democrats and Republicans must collaborate and work together to address this shortfall,'' said Governor Schwarzenegger. ''The longer we wait the worse the problem becomes and the more limited our choices will be.''
 Lawmakers will regroup in Sacramento on Wednesday. 
 Bill Watkins, an economist with University of California in Santa Barbara, said legislators ''have some interesting decisions to make now,'' adding: ''Education is definitely going to take a hit. The way we finance local governments is a travesty and funds will be taken away this time.''

HEADLINE: Venezuela's Hope of Greater Sway Dims as Riches Dip

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO; Alexei Barrionuevo contributed reporting from Brasilia, Brazil.

DATELINE: CARACAS 

 BODY:
President Hugo Chavez's push to extend his sway in Latin America is waning amid low oil prices and disorder in Venezuela's own energy industry.
 In recent years, Mr. Chavez has used his nation's oil wealth to drive his socialist-inspired agenda at home and draw other countries in the region into his sphere of influence, helping to consolidate a leftward political shift in parts of Latin America. 
 But more than a dozen big projects intended to broaden his nation's reach are in limbo -- including a gas pipeline across the continent and at least eight refineries, from Jamaica to Uruguay -- as Venezuela grapples with falling revenues and other troubles in its national oil company. 
 Venezuela is also cutting back sharply on other types of financial support for its neighbors, a cornerstone of its regional influence. One recent study by the Center of Economic Investigations, a financial consulting firm here, found that Venezuela had announced plans to spend only about $6 billion abroad this year, down from $79 billion in 2008.
 That includes proposed spending on everything from military purchases to aid, and points to a major weakening of Mr. Chavez's oil diplomacy. Gone, for instance, are multibillion-dollar outlays to buy Argentine bonds, replaced by modest loans like $9 million for growing rice in Haiti.
 Now countries that have been dependent on Venezuelan aid are turning elsewhere. Argentina locked in a $10 billion deal with China to help it buy Chinese imports, while Ecuador, a close ally of Venezuela, is rekindling ties to the International Monetary Fund, the kind of Western-dominated institution that Mr. Chavez scorns. 
 Some Venezuelan allies even appear to be warming to the Obama administration, sometimes in areas like military training. This month, President Rafael Correa of Ecuador sent a personal pilot to study at the Air War College in Montgomery, Ala. 
 Cuba, too, is cautiously opening the door to improving ties with Washington, while trying to attract investment from Brazil, potentially reducing its reliance on Venezuela.
 ''Chavez's influence is starting to reach its natural limits, after years of pushing a regional integration process where Venezuela was the hub and others are the spokes,'' said Daniel P. Erikson, an analyst at the Inter-American Dialogue, a research institution in Washington. ''Midsize countries in Latin America have no interest in being a spoke to Venezuela.''
 Larger countries, meanwhile, are pursuing their own agendas, helping to redraw the map of energy alliances and power in Latin America away from Venezuela and from Bolivia, a top ally of Mr. Chavez's with large natural gas reserves. Brazil, Argentina and Chile all moved forward this year with projects to import natural gas from rival sources, like Russia and Trinidad and Tobago. 
 Brazil has also emerged as an energy rival after discovering large amounts of oil and natural gas off its Atlantic coast. Now it is increasing exports to the United States, Mr. Chavez's top customer, while Venezuela's national oil company faces declining output from its oil fields.
 Despite the changes, Venezuela still retains broad influence in the region, including parts of the Caribbean and Central America, where it allows more than 15 nations to defer part of the bill for Venezuelan oil. Their debts to Venezuela climbed more than 30 percent in 2008, to $5.5 billion. 
 Another of Venezuela's top priorities, the formation of the Bank of the South, a development bank intended to counter the influence of the World Bank, also seems to be making some progress, though it is unclear when it will start operating.
 Venezuela also wields influence in ALBA, a cooperation group of about six of the region's poorest nations, including Nicaragua and Bolivia.
 Still, a sharp fall in oil revenue here has accentuated problems at the national oil company. Tensions are high with labor unions over salaries that trail the nation's inflation rate, the highest in Latin America. Losses are accumulating because Venezuela has some of the world's most generous domestic fuel subsidies, leading also to illegal smuggling of cheap fuel to Colombia. And there have been long delays in assembling complex export projects, and mounting debts. 
 Amid the problems, Mr. Chavez seized the assets of dozens of foreign and domestic oil contractors this month instead of paying debts to them valued at more than $10 billion.
 Under such pressures, Mr. Chavez has had to shift focus this year from the vast international projects that expand his influence to shoring up the national oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, which provides the country with more than 90 percent of its export income. In April, the company cut executive salaries by 20 percent and froze the salaries of its 75,000 employees.
 Other projects, like a long-delayed plan to tap offshore natural gas reserves by shipping the fuel in supertankers, are advancing at a snail's pace.
 ''Venezuela tried to impose its own view of energy integration in the region, but that model is falling to pieces,'' said Roger Tissot, an authority on Venezuela's energy industry at Gas Energy, a Brazilian consulting company. ''The potential markets are seizing on low energy prices to achieve diversity of supply.''
 Some of the strain may even be showing in Venezuela's program to provide subsidized oil to nations in the region. At least one country eager to participate, Costa Rica, has said that its request has languished, a potential sign that Caracas is less willing to take on new members at a time of declining revenues. At the same time, Costa Rica has been considering a deal with China for building a $6 billion oil refinery.
 By contrast, Brazil's ascendance in regional political and energy issues was on display after the election in March of a leftist in El Salvador, Mauricio Funes, who was greeted with enthusiasm by Mr. Chavez as proof of the ''historical current that has been rising in Latin America in this first decade of the 21st century.'' Yet Mr. Funes's first visit after winning was to meet with Brazil's moderate leftist president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
 ''I identify more with the Brazilian model than with Venezuela's, but I want good relations with them all,'' Mr. Funes said during the visit in March. Publicly, Brazil applauds Mr. Chavez's regional initiatives, like the often delayed Bank of the South, and the $20 billion pipeline from Venezuela to Argentina. But Brazil does so with caveats in line with its own interests. ''I think the project is feasible,'' Brazil's foreign minister, Celso Amorim, said in April of the pipeline, ''but during the crisis there are not any available funds. The large project should wait a while.''

HEADLINE: Sodas A Tempting Tax Target

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
''Sugar, rum and tobacco are commodities which are nowhere necessaries of life, which are become objects of almost universal consumption, and which are therefore extremely proper subjects of taxation.''
 -- Adam Smith,
 ''The Wealth of Nations,'' 1776
 That quotation, from the great philosopher of capitalism, appeared at the start of an article that ran a few weeks ago in The New England Journal of Medicine. The article argued for taxing Coke, Pepsi, Gatorade, Red Bull and any other sugar-sweetened beverage, largely to combat obesity.
 The authors were Kelly Brownell, a longtime obesity researcher at Yale, and Thomas Frieden, the New York City health commissioner. Since the article appeared, President Obama appointed Dr. Frieden to lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
 So one of the nation's top public health officials is now a fierce proponent of a soda tax. Meanwhile, other Obama advisers and some Senate staff members have been talking about such a tax -- which wouldn't apply to diet soda or real juice -- as a way to help pay for expanded health insurance. Among 15 options for paying for health care reform, a new Senate Finance Committee analysis lists a ''sugar-sweetened beverage excise tax.'' 
 Coca-Cola and PepsiCo hate this idea, of course, and they're fighting hard (if quietly) against it. Given the messy politics of tax increases, the industry seems likely to win this time. But the soda tax has already made the journey from unthinkable to plausible. It isn't too hard to imagine that, some day soon, Congress or a state legislature will see the tax as the least bad way to raise desperately needed revenue.
 Whatever happens, the debate over soda tax is a useful one, because it does a nice job of capturing some of the most serious problems with our current tax system. Not only has the system been failing to collect enough revenue to cover government expenses, but it is also complex in all the wrong ways. 
 The tax code has layer upon layer of subsidies, deductions, exemptions and extra taxes that serve no good purpose. There is a huge exemption for employer-provided insurance, which has numbed us to the crushing cost of health care and is deeply unfair to people who must buy insurance on their own. There are hotel taxes, because it's politically easy to tax out-of-towners. And there are taxes that seem to defy all reason, like New Jersey's tax on health club memberships.
 On the other hand, activities that really deserve to be taxed -- activities that place a cost on the rest of society -- often go untaxed or undertaxed. Economists refer to taxes on such activities as Pigovian taxes, after the 20th-century English economist Arthur Cecil Pigouwho advocated them. 
 Pigovian taxes have the double advantage of discouraging costly activities and helping to cover the costs that remain. Tobacco taxes have become the shining example. Yet alcohol taxes have fallen 35 percent since the early 1990s, adjusted for inflation. We still don't have a carbon tax or its cousin, a cap-and-trade system. Nor do we have a tax on excess calories.
 In coldly economic terms, you can make a case that calories are the single best candidate for a Pigovian tax.
 Most public health scourges have a brutal way of holding down the associated medical cost: they kill people. That's why preventive medicine doesn't provide nearly the cost savings that some advocates claim. ''One of the uncomfortable truths is that when you prevent an illness,'' says Dana Goldman, the head of the health program at the Rand Corporation, ''you prolong a life and can increase costs.''
 Obesity is different. It has only a modest effect on life span, but it causes costly chronic illnesses, like diabetes. 
 For some people, obesity is a matter of genetic predisposition, and it can't be prevented. But most of today's obesity problem is about behavior. The average 18-year-old is only a fraction of an inch taller than the average 18-year-old three decades ago, but 15 pounds heavier. Gene pools don't change in three decades. 
 Soda consumption has changed -- a lot. The typical person now consumes 190 calories a day from sugary drinks, up from 70 a day in the late 1970s. That 120-calorie increase represents about one-half of the total daily caloric increase during that span, C.D.C. data shows.
 Of all foods and beverages, says Mr. Brownell, the obesity researcher, ''the science is most robust and most convincing on the link between soft drinks and negative health outcomes.'' 
 Just as important for the purposes of a soda tax, economic research has found that soda drinkers are price sensitive. In the past, when the price of soda has risen by 10 percent, consumption has dropped by an average of roughly 8 percent. This means a soda tax may not be quite as regressive as it sounds, because poor people would end up buying less soda than they now do.
 I found these arguments fairly compelling, and I wanted to hear how executives at Coke and Pepsi would respond. But they refused to talk. 
 Bryan Anderson, the head of Coke's Washington office, and Dan Bryant, the head of Pepsi's, didn't return my calls. Spokesmen for the companies said the industry's lobbying group, the American Beverage Association, was making all comments. 
 And it definitely has been making some comments. The association has an unsigned blog that criticizes soda tax proponents as ''well-paid professional food police'' at ''East Coast universities.'' One recent entry was devoted to praising Bill Clinton -- whose foundation helps run a program that keeps some (but not all) sweetened drinks out of schools and has received money from the industry -- for coming out against a soda tax. ''Mr. President,'' it concluded, ''we thank you for being a stand-up guy.''
 When I got on the phone with Susan Neely, the association's president, I tried to get beyond the name-calling and instead asked one question over and over: do you think the increase in sugary-drink consumption is an important reason obesity has increased? 
 Ms. Neely, in a pleasant tone, wouldn't answer. She kept answering different questions, like whether soda was the only reason we have gained so much weight.
 ''I think that we are consuming too many calories from a variety of sources and not getting enough exercise,'' she finally said.
 It's certainly true that a soda tax, by itself, won't solve the multibillion-dollar obesity problem. A true Pigovian approach would be much broader. It would get rid of the current government subsidies for corn syrup -- and that New Jersey gym tax. It would use taxes and subsidies to reverse the long-term decline in the price of junk food and the long-term rise in the price of fruits and vegetables. Some economists say health insurance premiums should be lower for people who keep fit.
 As Ms. Neely says, ''It's a simple equation -- calories in, calories out.'' 
 Indeed it is. We just shouldn't lose sight of how many of those ''calories in'' come from Coke, Pepsi and the like. If we could cut back on our soda drinking, we would be both thinner and richer.

HEADLINE: Work Resumes on International Gem Tower in Diamond District

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The city approved the project in 2006. 
 Demolition of a half dozen buildings in the diamond district followed in 2007, and workers excavated the site last year and poured concrete for the foundation walls.
 So the developer, Gary Barnett, couldn't very well use the word ''groundbreaking'' on Tuesday morning. But he did describe the ''first phase'' of building the 34-story International Gem Tower, on the south side of 47th Street between Fifth Avenue and Avenue of the Americas, before television cameras and a milling crowd of diamond dealers and tourists in what turned out to be a marketing opportunity for both him and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.
 Mr. Barnett, the chief executive of the Extell Development Company, promoted his long-awaited $750 million tower, albeit six stories shorter than he originally envisioned it, in the hope of attracting his first tenants, while Mr. Bloomberg wrapped it into his oft-repeated election-year ''five-borough economic opportunity plan.'' 
 ''For the first time,'' Mr. Barnett, a former diamond dealer, told the crowd, ''New York City's diamond district will have an international gem and jewelry center on par with other global markets.''
 It is a gambler's move, said Sushil Goyal, who owns Liberty Gems, four doors west of the construction site, at a time when many developers, like Boston Properties, are canceling planned office towers in light of corporate layoffs and rising vacancies. About 20,000 construction workers in New York City have lost their jobs since August.
 Hoping to counter any notion that New York is grinding to a halt, Mayor Bloomberg applauded Mr. Barnett's decision to forge ahead, saying that the tower would provide more than thousands of construction and permanent jobs and help New York City ''compete with worldwide gem markets like Shanghai, Dubai and Las Vegas.''
 That may be, but even the planned 50-story World Jewelry Center in Las Vegas, which was announced about the same time that Mr. Barnett unveiled plans for his diamond tower, has delayed its construction schedule, and scrapped plans for 100 residential condominiums.
 Still, Mr. Barnett appears to be doing what few of his rivals are willing to do in the current downturn: put up a lot of his own money. 
 Mr. Barnett said that he and his investors were contributing $175 million, and got an extension of their original $170 million loan for three years. 
 By the end of the year, Extell hopes to sign deals with jewelers, merchants and banks for enough office condominiums to obtain a construction loan. If not, construction could stop.
 Mr. Barnett, who said he had received strong interest from gem and diamond dealers from abroad, seems to be taking a modular approach to the project. Over the next six or seven months, he will construct the tower's three basement levels, which will contain high-security safes for jewelers. At the same time, he will try to sell or lease office space at the top of the tower to financial firms or corporations, which would have their own entrance on 46th Street.
 As an inducement, the Bloomberg administration and the state have agreed to provide Extell with up to $49.6 million in tax breaks if it fills 85 percent of the tower with new or expanding jewelry businesses.
 Originally, Mr. Barnett planned to lure two centerpieces of the industry: the Diamond Dealers Club and the Gemological Institute. But both to stay in their current offices nearby. So to fill his 750,000-square-foot tower, Mr. Barnett has turned to diamond and jewelry dealers who typically use a couple of thousand square feet each.
 Mr. Goyal, at Liberty Gems, said he was very interested in a modern tower that would provide a roof for much of the industry.
 His friend, Haridas Kotahwala, president of the Indian Diamond and Colored Stone Association, agreed. ''I would prefer to buy 5,000 square feet,'' said Mr. Kotahwala, who runs Royal India USA on 46th Street. ''He can sell the whole building if he comes in at a good price.''
 But Mr. Kotahwala's idea of a good price is $600 to $700 a square foot, about $500 less than what Extell has in mind.

HEADLINE: Highway to the Unknown

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
President Obama has cast himself as a reluctant interventionist in two of the nation's major industries, Wall Street and Detroit. The federal aid, he says, is a financial bridge to a postcrisis future and the hand-holding will be temporary.
 Even so, the scale of the government investment and control -- especially by the auto task force now vetting plans at Chrysler and General Motors -- points to an approach that has been shunned by the United States more than other developed nations.
 ''By any coherent definition, this is industrial policy,'' said Marcus Noland, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. 
 Industrial policy refers to government programs tailored for a specific industry instead of actions whose effects are felt across an economy, like monetary policy or tax rates. 
 Mr. Obama's declaration on Tuesday of tougher rules on automobile emissions and mileage standards is both an environmental and an industrial policy. The new national standards require carmakers to produce fleets that are 40 percent cleaner and more fuel efficient by 2016. In the United States, industrial policy has long been viewed with suspicion by many policy makers and economists, who consider it government meddling in the private sector and a violation of free-market principles. 
 Industrial policy was a hotly debated topic in the 1980s, with the rising challenge from ''Japan Inc.'' in industries as varied as automobiles and semiconductors. But as the competitiveness of the American economy revived and the Japanese challenge ebbed, the attention to government support faded.
 Today, economists, along with public policy and Japan experts, say the model sometimes has a role, and they point to qualified success stories. But with Washington venturing into this area, they warn that industrial policy tends to be strewn with pitfalls, as political influence too often trumps economic efficiency.
 The strategy, they say, works best when the path ahead is well defined: catching up in an industry, as Japan did so well with semiconductors for a while; or softening the social impact of industries that are consolidating or contracting, as Japan did in shipbuilding and parts of steel making. 
 Industrial policy, they say, frequently falters when it approaches a technological frontier.
 Japanese industrial policy in computing technology shows both the promise and the limits of the approach. Japan's government-guided program to develop improved processes for making computer chips in the late 1970s proved quite successful. 
 By the early 1980s, the American leader, Intel, was staggering under the Japanese assault so badly that I.B.M. stepped in and bought a 20 percent stake in Intel to prop up a crucial domestic supplier. Under attack, Intel made the leap to a new generation of chip technology.
 The Japanese chip makers did not make that bold bet on the future. And the country's computer industry was single-mindedly focused on following I.B.M. in bulky mainframe computers. ''Japan missed the big shift to microprocessors and personal computers in the 1980s,'' said Edward J. Lincoln, an economist and Japan expert at the Stern School of Business at New York University.
 Detroit faces two challenges: first shrinking in size and trimming costs, and then moving toward a future that is expected to rely on alternative technologies, like battery-powered electric cars.
 In contracting businesses, industrial policy suggests an active role for government in softening the effects for displaced workers and affected communities. ''To me, the strongest argument for industrial policy was always easing the pain and smoothing the adjustment,'' said Robert B. Reich, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley.
 Mr. Reich, a labor secretary in the Clinton administration, is critical of the Obama administration's auto rescue plan for being focused mainly on the financial engineering of recovery. He recommends wage insurance and retraining programs linked to economic development projects to bring new industries to communities suffering from auto plant closings.
 In the long term, a different and perhaps bright future beckons for Detroit. It could depend on nonfood biofuels, like wood chips and algae, which experts predict could someday be produced for $1 a gallon and substitute for up to half of the gasoline consumed by American cars.
 Another potentially promising path, energy experts say, is electric cars, using advanced batteries. Japan leads in plug-in hybrids, and China and other foreign producers have ambitious plans. But G.M.'s entry, the Chevrolet Volt, is scheduled to go on sale next year. And Ford has a prototype car, called Project M. 
 A lithium-ion battery start-up, A123 Systems, has applied for a $1.8 billion loan from the Energy Department to build a series of car-battery plants, the first planned for southeast Michigan. 
 Such a future, experts say, might also entail auto companies transforming the way they do business, working closely with electric utilities or start-ups like Better Place, based in Palo Alto, Calif., to provide cars, batteries and electricity as a bundled service with monthly fees.
 ''The technology is beginning to appear to make us think very differently about cars,'' said David E. Cole, chairman of the Center for Automotive Research, a nonprofit organization in Ann Arbor, Mich. ''And whole new business models are becoming possible and likely.''
 Industrial policy, economists say, can hasten technological shifts by financing research in a field. Such research, they say, benefits the economy as a whole -- a payoff beyond the spending that individual companies could justify.
 ''That is the big argument for public-funded but private sector-conducted research and development,'' said Robert N. Stavins, an economist at Harvard. ''You want companies and researchers finding the way forward instead of having it defined by government.''
 But any alternative future is years down the road for Detroit. It will depend on federal research incentives, environmental policies and fuel prices. 
 Still, government policy, some experts say, that is merely a lifeline for Detroit is too narrow a goal. That was what was done at the start of the 1980s, when Washington negotiated so-called voluntary restraints on auto exports with Japan. The pact eased the competitive threat on Detroit and forced Japanese automakers to build factories in the United States. Yet it proved a short-lived reprieve because Detroit's underlying problems -- high costs and dependence on fuel-hungry models -- were not addressed.
 ''If all we do is put money into Detroit to give them breathing room, it will fail and we shouldn't do it,'' said Clyde V. Prestowitz, president of the Economic Strategy Institute and a trade negotiator in the Reagan administration.
 Yet a more comprehensive, industrial-policylike approach to Detroit carries its own perils, economists say. In trying to manage the industrial shrinkage, they say, there is a fine line between easing the social impact and protecting jobs in ways that inhibit economic change and renewal. In pursuit of new growth, governments risk encouraging overinvestment in areas that prove to be technological dead ends.
 In the Japanese experience, economists see evidence of both dangers. Problems, they say, are typically byproducts of what economists call ''political capture.'' That is, an industrial sector earmarked for special government attention builds up its own political constituency, lobbyists and government bureaucrats to serve that industry. They slow the pace of change, and an economy becomes less nimble and efficient as a result.
 Economists say the phenomenon is scarcely confined to nations with explicit industrial policies and cite the history of agricultural subsidies in America or military procurement practices.
 But going down the path of industrial policy certainly holds that risk. ''You have to bear in mind the opportunity costs of these kinds of government interventions, and remember that life is not an economic textbook and that politics can easily override economic rationality,'' said Mr. Noland, an author, with Howard Pack, of ''Industrial Policy in an Era of Globalization: Lessons From Asia.''

HEADLINE: As Political Winds Shift, Detroit Charts New Course

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER and MICHELINE MAYNARD; John M. Broder reported from Washington, and Micheline Maynard from Detroit.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Why, after decades of battling, complaining and maneuvering over fuel economy standards, did carmakers fall in line behind the tough new nationwide mileage standard President Obama announced Tuesday? 
 Because they had no choice. The auto industry is flat on its back, with Chrysler in bankruptcy, General Motors close to it, and both companies taking billions of dollars in federal money. Foreign automakers are getting help from their own governments. Climate change legislation is barreling down the track, and Congress showed last fall that it had no appetite to side with Detroit any more.
 Simply put, Detroit and the other companies need Washington's help, and they are powerless to block the rules Washington dictates. 
 ''They can feel the political winds changing,'' said David Doniger, a lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council who has faced the car companies in court many times. ''They need government aid to stay in business. When you have your hand out for help, it's hard to use the same hand to thumb your nose at the federal government.''
 It is a clear victory for the president, who introduced fuel economy legislation as one of his first acts as a senator, and it is the latest blow in a four-year decline in Detroit's influence in Washington.
 In 2005, car companies were able to stop fuel economy legislation. By 2007, with the country awakened to the realization that global warming was a threat, they were forced to go along with higher standards but managed to water them down. 
 This time, they arrived at the table so debilitated they could extract only the barest of concessions. The primary gift carmakers received from Mr. Obama in Tuesday's proposal was the certainty of one fuel economy standard from California to Maine, rather than the patchwork that would have resulted from two sets of regulations, one by the 18 states that wanted tighter standards, and another for everywhere else.
 ''We understood there had to be a different approach,'' said Dave McCurdy, the former Democratic congressman hired by the auto companies two years ago to be their chief voice in Washington. ''We saw the election of Obama as a unique opportunity to bridge the differences between all the stakeholders and to provide certainty and clarity to the manufacturers.''
 Yet there is more to come. The troubled auto industry is at the front end of a wave of changes driven by President Obama's determination to put the United States on a fossil fuel diet. The administration is moving on multiple fronts, from the Environmental Protection Agency's proposed finding that heat-trapping gases are a threat to health and the environment to the sweeping cap-and-trade legislation moving through Congress. 
 Taken together, these measures may create markets for fuel-efficient cars, change how Americans heat and light their homes and, ultimately, decide what industries will rise and fall.
 On Tuesday, Mr. Obama gathered the chief executives of 10 auto companies from around the world in the Rose Garden to announce his proposal for a single national fuel-efficiency standard of 35.5 miles per gallon by 2016, a nearly 40 percent increase from today's level. Also in attendance were environmental advocates, officials from California and Michigan and cabinet members who worked on the plan.
 Mr. Obama praised the car companies' willingness to cooperate in the effort, saying it marked a sharp reversal. ''You know, in the past, an agreement such as this would have been considered impossible,'' he said.
 James C. Lentz, the president of Toyota Motor Sales USA, now the country's second-biggest seller behind Ford, said he could not recall a similar occasion when executives from American and foreign companies, environmental groups and state officials had gathered at the White House in agreement.
 Mr. Lentz said consumers' swift reaction to record gasoline prices last summer was an important factor in the industry's embrace of higher fuel standards. ''The industry woke up to the fact last year that when gas hit $4.50 a gallon, consumers were going to demand better fuel economy,'' he said.
 At the same time, the auto companies found themselves on the losing end of a string of environmental lawsuits, including the big one, Massachusetts v. E.P.A., in which the Supreme Court gave the Environmental Protection Agency the authority to regulate vehicle emissions of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide.
 The industry also suffered from the diminished power of its staunchest ally in Washington, Representative John D. Dingell, the Michigan Democrat who has served in Congress for 54 years.
 In November, Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, wrested the chairmanship of the Energy and Commerce Committee from Mr. Dingell in a hard-fought battle. Mr. Dingell had used his perch there to protect the automakers from repeated efforts by lawmakers and agency officials to strengthen automotive environmental, safety and mileage standards.
 Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, was a co-author of the 2007 mileage standards and, with Mr. Waxman, of the climate change bill before Congress. Mr. Markey said the fuel-efficiency law, looming E.P.A. regulation of emissions and the election of Mr. Obama had put the carmakers in a vise.
 ''With the full political force of Congress and a new administration pushing the automakers, and the business folly of an overreliance on gas guzzlers on full display to the American consumer,'' Mr. Markey said, ''the auto industry was simply unable to continue their strategy of delaying action, denying they could meet higher standards and litigating to prevent them in the first place.''
 Jason S. Grumet, president of the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington, said the auto manufacturers were seeing this agreement as a lifeline and a way to end 30 years of conflict.
 ''It represents one place that was important to their future where they could seize a measure of control of their own destiny,'' said Mr. Grumet, who is close to many of the administration's energy and environment policy makers. 
 ''I also think this was a classic example of an entrenched disagreement that had outlived its useful life,'' Mr. Grumet said. ''The fight had exhausted itself. People on all sides of the issue were ready to reach a principled compromise and move forward.''

HEADLINE: Nations Criticize Myanmar Over Pro-Democracy Leader's Trial

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS

DATELINE: BANGKOK 

 BODY:
As protests grew around the world, the trial of Myanmar's pro-democracy leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, continued for a second day Tuesday, with the government pursuing charges that could transform her house arrest into the harsher conditions of a prison term. 
 Hundreds of police officers, some in full riot gear, blocked roads leading to Insein Prison, where the trial is being held, and a small number of protesters gathered in the street outside a ring of barbed wire, according to reports from the scene by news agencies and exile groups.
 Analysts say the case against Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, 63, is intended as a legal pretext for extending her house arrest, which would otherwise expire later this month. Myanmar plans to hold a general election early next year to cement the control of the military under a nominally civilian administration.
 Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi is charged with receiving an unauthorized visitor after an intrusion by an American, John Yettaw, who swam across a lake two weeks ago and entered the compound where she has been held under house arrest for 13 of the past 19 years. 
 Her lawyers say that she had no role in his intrusion and asked him to leave, but that she let him stay the night when he complained of exhaustion and leg cramps. Her two housekeepers are on trial with her on similar charges, which could bring prison terms of up to five years.
 Mr. Yettaw, who is also a defendant in the trial, faces up to six years in prison for breaking security and immigration laws. 
 In Washington, a State Department spokesman, Ian Kelly, said the charges against Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi were unjustified and demanded her release, along with that of an estimated 2,100 other political prisoners. Last week, in response to her arrest, the United States extended harsh economic sanctions against the ruling military junta, although the American government had said it was reviewing the effectiveness of this policy. 
 Other condemnation came from around the world, including from the United Nations and the European Union. Breaching a low-key policy of ''constructive engagement,'' Myanmar's Southeast Asian neighbors issued a statement late Monday expressing ''grave concern'' over Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's arrest and saying ''the honor and credibility'' of the Myanmar government were at stake.
 The statement, issued by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean, read: ''The Government of the Union of Myanmar, as a responsible member of Asean, has the responsibility to protect and promote human rights. It is therefore called upon to provide timely and adequate medical care to Daw Aung San Suu Kyi as well as to accord her humane treatment with dignity.''
 The members of Asean are Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Also on Monday, nine Nobel Peace Prize laureates condemned the arrest of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, who won the prize in 1991. ''We are outraged by the deplorable actions of the military junta against Suu Kyi and strongly encourage challenging this obvious harassment of our fellow Nobel laureate,'' the prize winners said in a statement.

HEADLINE: Senate Passes Bill to Restrict Credit Card Practices

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT; Carl Hulse and Peter Baker contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Senate voted overwhelmingly on Tuesday to put new restrictions on the credit card industry, passing a bill whose backers say will make card-issuers spell out their terms in fewer words, using plain English, and treat customers more fairly.
 The 90-to-5 vote, following a 357-to-70 vote in the House on April 30, made it likely that President Obama will have a measure on his desk before the Memorial Day recess. The differences between the House and Senate versions will have to be worked out, but given the political atmosphere it seems likely that the House-Senate negotiations will move quickly. 
 ''We stood up for consumers and stood up to abusive credit card companies,'' Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic majority leader, said after the vote. ''We said that big banks can no longer take advantage of hardworking Americans. We demanded that when Americans use a credit card -- as almost everyone does almost every day -- they no longer have to fear that they'll be abused.''
 The industry has asserted that the legislation may backfire, forcing banks to issue fewer credit cards at greater cost to the current cardholders and making credit harder to get at a time when many Americans need it. 
 Edward L. Yingling, president and chief executive of the American Bankers Association, said the bill passed on Tuesday contained provisions that were ''tough, but workable.''
 ''It also, unfortunately, contains some provisions that will undermine the availability of credit,'' Mr. Yingling said. ''Credit cards are a strong economic driver and are relied upon by consumers and small businesses to make payments and to bridge short-term financial gaps.'' 
 Most importantly, he said, ''this bill fundamentally changes the entire business model of credit cards by restricting the ability to price credit for risk.'' 
 But the tide has been running against the banking and credit card industry, with many consumers mired in debt and the public angered by the bailout of financial firms and by reports of large executive pay packages.
 ''Any effort to restore confidence in our economy must start not on Wall Street but in Main Street, and that's what the credit card situation is all about,'' Mr. Reid said before Tuesday's vote.
 Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat who heads the Senate Banking Committee, said the bill became a reality because of cooperation from Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the panel's ranking Republican, and many other lawmakers on both sides.
 President Obama has spoken derisively of the multi-page, fine-print statements familiar to millions of credit card-users. Last week, he told a receptive crowd in New Mexico that ''you should not have to worry that when you sign up for a credit card, you're signing away all your rights. You shouldn't need a magnifying glass or a law degree to read the fine print that sometimes doesn't even appear to be written in English.''
 Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, a senior Democrat on the finance and commerce committees, said, ''We've got too many hard-working families in Massachusetts struggling to keep their heads above water, and the last thing they need is to get whacked with unfair credit card fees.'' 
 Among other things, the Senate measure would prohibit companies from raising interest rates on existing balances unless a card holder was 60 days behind, and then it would require the rate to be restored to its previous level if payments were on time for six months. Consumers would have to be notified of rate increases 45 days in advance. And companies could not charge a late fee if they were late processing a payment.
 Statements would have to be mailed 21 days before a payment was due. It would be harder for companies to issue cards to people under age 21. Rates could not be increased within the first year, and promotional rates would be in force for at least six months.
 Credit card debt has increased by 25 percent in the last decade, with delinquency rates up by more than a third since 2006, according to statistics cited by the White House. Americans pay $15 billion in penalty fees a year, accounting for about 10 percent of the industry's revenues. About a fifth of those carrying credit card debt pay more than 20 percent in interest.
 One amendment attached to the Senate bill by Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, would restore a Bush administration policy allowing loaded guns in national parks. That provision is not in the House version, so there may be discussions between the two chambers over the issue. 
 Voting against the Senate measure on Tuesday were Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Robert Bennett of Utah, Jon Kyl of Arizona and John Thune of South Dakota, all Republicans, and one Democrat, Tim Johnson of South Dakota. (The credit card industry accounts for thousands of jobs in South Dakota.)
 Before Tuesday's vote, the senators applauded their colleague Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, who cast the 11,000th vote of his Senate career. ''I couldn't think of a better bill to cast this 11,000th vote on,'' Mr. Levin said.

HEADLINE: Safer Credit Cards

 BODY:
Congress moved a full step closer to making it less hazardous for millions of Americans to keep using their credit cards. The Senate voted 90 to 5 Tuesday in favor of a reform that would prohibit credit card issuers from such unfair tactics as tripling interest rates overnight or passing out cards to clueless teenagers. 
 The Senate bill is a slightly stronger version of the House bill, also approved by an impressive majority. The two are similar enough that the legislation could be ready for President Obama to sign by Memorial Day. 
 Both versions would require important improvements in a business so unfair that one Obama economic adviser described it as ''a series of carjackings'' even for some of the best customers. 
 When the law goes into effect -- the Senate would give the companies nine months to get ready, the House about a year -- they would be prohibited from raising rates on existing balances unless the cardholder is 60 days late in paying. All customers would have to be notified 45 days in advance of any rate increase, and young people (under 21 in the Senate bill, 18 in the House version) would need an adult's signature or proof that they have a way of repaying any new debt before getting a new card. 
 Instead of the old microprint credit card contracts comprehensible only to a few bankers, the new agreements are supposed to be written in plain English and will be posted on the Internet. The Federal Reserve Board would also be required to review companies' practices periodically for violations. 
 These companies have already proved themselves to be infinitely inventive, at the consumers' expense. So Congress and the Federal Reserve will have to be vigilant to ensure that the old tricks and traps are not quickly replaced by new ones.
 Unfortunately, the powerful pro-gun forces in the Senate managed to contaminate the bill with an amendment to allow licensed owners to carry loaded firearms into national parks. This is a cynical attempt by the gun lobby to take advantage of consumers when they most need Washington's help. The House, which could vote on the Senate version as soon as Wednesday, should reject the amendment -- even if it takes a little longer for the bill to go to the White House.

HEADLINE: A Season Opener Includes An Obama in the House

BYLINE: By ALASTAIR MACAULAY

 BODY:
The speech that Michelle Obama made at American Ballet Theater's opening-night gala on Monday was at once the evening's most historic event and, potentially, its most valuable corrective. Introducing the students of the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis School at American Ballet Theater, Mrs. Obama spoke of how the arts can ''express, enable and empower Americans of all ages,'' and she paid tribute to the former first lady whose name adorns that school. 
 She also said, ''My husband and I believe firmly that arts education develops innovative thinkers.'' I wanted to burst into applause as she said this, but by the end of the gala, I wished she had said it on some other occasion. Ballet Theater's spring season at the Metropolitan Opera House tends to be ballet at its most conformist, nowhere more so than in its opening-night jamboree. 
 It was both sweet and impressive to see dozens of those students dancing so well, but ''The Procession'' by Raymond Lukens, an array of mainly fast classroom steps (to Boccherini's ''Ritirata Notturna di Madrid'' as arranged by Luciano Berio) designed principally as show-off, is scarcely choreography. It suggests the opposite of innovative thinking and proposes that the ballet career these students are pursuing is principally one of knocking off multiple pirouettes and jumps of the most orthodox kind. 
 Alexei Ratmansky's new ''Waltz Masquerade,'' to music by Khachaturian, was a frothy concoction for the ballerina Nina Ananiashvili (who retires at the end of this season), assisted by four of the company's male principals. The joke, a thin one, was that Ms. Ananiashvili, who looked half her age, seemed to falter and collapse, only then to brush off these attentive men and depart, exultant, in top-speed turns. 
 For those of us who had been missing those old-style numbers (George Balanchine and Frederick Ashton excelled in them) in which a ballerina seemed to make something out of nothing, it was oddly endearing to see a new if minor specimen of the genre. Mr. Ratmansky gave Ms. Ananiashvili one particular little beaten step (in ballet terminology, a grand battement raccourci battu) that intoxicatingly caught a recurrent figure in the music. 
 The last of the evening's three novelties was ''Piece d'Occasion,'' in which Herbie Hancock played a jazz piano piece of his own in idioms resembling now Falla, now Rachmaninoff. The dancers Jose Manuel Carreno and Stella Abrera joined him separately; Mr. Carreno briefly tried to do something with some routine ballet steps, then settled instead for nothing. 
 Everything else was, as is usual with Ballet Theater's spring gala, a preview of the season's coming attractions. If only the company would invest in a compere for these galas to explain what's what and who's who. Sure, we could all switch on our cellphones' LCDs to see in the program book that the item after ''The Procession'' was from Act II of ''La Sylphide,'' but wouldn't most of the audience have been happier if someone had informed us charmingly that this ballet is set in the Scotland that Walter Scott made Romantic? That it is the oldest choreography in international repertory (1836)? That this excerpt shows the enchanting moment when the hero, James, finds that the Sylphide to whom he has lost his heart is not the world's only sylph but one of many? And that, unlike the lost 1832 original Parisian ''Sylphide'' and the many other 19th-century ballets that followed, this one shows the hero dancing the same steps alongside his beloved and her companions?
 These facts aren't arcane. They would deepen anybody's pleasure in this ''Sylphide'' scene, which, out of context, may look more quaint than it is. 
 Gala audiences in my experience don't mind being educated. Rather than being treated as if they know all they need to, they love being given things to look for. The same compere could have pointed out how the famous pas de deux from ''Swan Lake,'' Act II (in a version correctly described in the program as ''after'' Lev Ivanov's choreography), is a late-Romantic variation on the original ''Sylphide'' idea. Here the princely hero is a nondancing cavalier amid the many swan-maidens who resemble the one with whom he is falling in love. (Though he dances elsewhere in the ballet, he does not in the presence of these enchanted beings.)
 As it happens, Ivanov's original 1895 ''Swan Lake'' pas de deux was actually a pas de deux a trois, with the prince's friend Benno assisting in the partnering. (This version was still danced in the early 1960s, and it could be restored to good effect: it makes clearer that the heroine, in her alarm and conflicted feelings about the prince's love for her, repeatedly falls away from him, only to be chivalrously caught by another man she doesn't even see. Wouldn't this make ''Swan Lake'' less like any other ballet?) And speaking of pas de deux a trois, wouldn't a gala audience appreciate being told what on earth is going on in ''Le Corsaire''? 
 We're in a recession that may prove a depression. One way for ballet to survive is to keep shoveling out ever more fouette turns and grandes pirouettes and multiple entrechat-six and circuits of turns or jumps on the assumption that audiences can't get enough of them. Another is for those in charge to help audiences become more intelligently interested. Which will Ballet Theater take?
 Parts of Monday's gala showed that Mrs. Obama was right about innovative thinkers, but too little of the program helped us notice this. In the choreography by Ashton, Balanchine and Bournonville, you can see how these masters took standard ballet formulas and made ingenious rearrangements. 
 Fouette turns, for example, are usually a stunt for a solo ballerina, but Ashton in Act I of ''Sylvia'' (we saw the dance in which the chaste huntress heroine and her companions enter) had the wit to make eight women do fouette turns at the same time. (The conductor Ormsby Wilkins made Delibes's thrilling fanfares more thumping than they need be, but Michele Wiles danced Sylvia with elegant flair.) 
 None of the three Balanchine excerpts made a full impression. Sarah Lane and Daniil Simkin led the ''Theme and Variations'' finale well, but you realize that this is the most exciting ending ever only if you see what has gone before. Gillian Murphy and Ethan Stiefel brought technical but not musical brilliance to the ''Tchaikovsky Pas de Deux''; I have seen weaker dancers find more surprise in this number. Veronika Part was weightily pious in the ''Mozartiana'' Preghiera. 
 Occasionally Monday's gala reminded me how much there is to look forward to in Ballet Theater's spring season. Herman Cornejo's James in ''Sylphide,'' Ms. Wiles's Sylvia, Ms. Lane and Mr. Simkin in ''Theme and Variations'': there is now good cause to have high hopes of these in complete performances. 
 Better yet were Diana Vishneva and Marcelo Gomes in the balcony pas de deux from Kenneth MacMillan's ''Romeo and Juliet.'' Ms. Vishneva, a ballerina dancing for the first time on a New York stage in more than a year but now in the early summer of her gifts, danced Juliet with liquid ease and riveting focus; Mr. Gomes's Romeo is an embodiment of chivalry. Ballet Theater has fewer true ballerinas than its repertory requires. On Monday, however, there was no doubting that Ms. Ananiashvili and Ms. Vishneva were among those few. 
 The American Ballet Theater season runs through July 11 at the Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center; (212) 362-6000, www.abt.org.

 BODY:
Overview: In this lesson, students examine and learn the basics about credit cards and credit-card debt, then create an informational brochure for young students.
Author(s):
Sandhya Nankani, The New York Times Learning Network
Suggested Time Allowance: 1-2 class periods.
Activities / Procedures:
1. Warm-Up/Do Now:
Give students a copy of the handout "Extra Credit", a True/False quiz which tests their background knowledge about credit cards and the credit card industry.
When students have completed the quiz, share the answers with them:
1) False 2) True 3) True; the specific number is 5.3 cards for the average American 4) False 5) False 6) True 7) True 8) True 9) False (there is no minimum age).
Use each statement on the quiz as a jumping-off point for a brief discussion about the credit-card system in America, and invite students to share observations and comments, as well as personal experiences with credit cards. Wrap up by telling students that they are going to be reading an article about the current credit crisis and both government and credit card companies responses to it. Given the current legislation being circulated through Congress, this topic is especially timely; check NYTimes.com for news updates.
2. ARTICLE QUESTIONS:
As a class, read and discuss the article "Obama Seeks Action Against Credit Card Industry," focusing on the following questions:
a. What is President Obama's main complaint against the credit card industry? Highlight a telling quote in the article.
b. What would the bill that Senate and Congress are considering passing accomplish? Why is it important at this particular time?
c. What statistic in the article is most revealing or surprising to you, and why?
d. How does Ms. Lardner claim the credit card company deceived her?
e. Why do you think credit card companies would want to raise interest rates?
3. ACTIVITY:
Distribute copies of the handout "In Search of Credit" to students. Divide the class into pairs or small groups and tell them that they are going to be engaging in an Internet scavenger hunt about the credit card industry so that they can become better acquainted with the world of credit cards and to enable them to become more educated consumers in the long-term, as well as to familiarize them with the connection between the economic crisis and credit cards.
The handout includes a list of Web sites that are helpful starting points for their research. Please see the "Resources" section below for more.
When students have completed the scavenger hunt, gather them together to discuss their findings. Have them compare their answers and encourage them to share their reactions to the activity. Ask: What have you learned about the credit card industry that you did not know before? Have you learned anything that you think will be useful in your own life? How, if at all, does this make you think differently about using or having a credit card? Do you think the recent advocacy and legislation is going to affect the way credit card companies do business and the way American consumers use credit cards and interact with debt, or is this just a passing phase?
Invite students to reflect on the statistics they uncovered during the research, and have them create a poster or graphic for the classroom that displays these statistics or illustrates the concept of personal debt.
4. FOR HOMEWORK OR FUTURE CLASSES:
Have students watch the video "Debt Trap: College Borrowing Catches Up." Then, individually, they write, design and create an informational consumers' guide to credit cards for college students. The guide should provide an overview of how credit cards work, red flags to watch out for, and an overview or glossary of key terms. These guides or brochures can be illustrated and distributed, perhaps through the school's college or counseling office to graduating high school seniors or incoming college freshmen.
Among other resources, they may wish to consult the Times feature Credit and Debit Cards: What You Need To Know and Consumers Guide's free report, "Building and Keeping Good Credit."

HEADLINE: Gas Is Up, but Drivers May Look the Other Way

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
Thanks to lower fuel costs and a proliferation of travel bargains, Americans are expected to hit the roads this Memorial Day weekend in bigger numbers than last year. 
 Last summer's energy shock drove gasoline prices well above $4 a gallon and forced people to cut back on driving. Then oil prices plunged, and the stratospheric cost of a gallon of gas became a dim memory. But gasoline has been rising rapidly in recent weeks.
 Gasoline is selling for an average of $2.33 a gallon, up from $2.06 just last month, according to AAA, the automobile club, and a steep rise from the recent low of $1.67 a gallon in December. A cutback in refining production and the expected rebound in driving this weekend are helping to push up prices at the pump. 
 Some analysts expect to see gas rise above $2.50 a gallon this summer.
 The number of people traveling by car this weekend is projected to rise by 2.7 percent compared with 2008, to 27 million people, according to projections from AAA. Last year, road travel fell by 9.6 percent when prices surged, according to the automobile group. 
 ''The bargains and the cheaper gas, combined with the stressed-out consumer who is ready for a break, will trump other concerns,'' Robert L. Darbelnet, AAA's chief executive, told reporters last week. ''It is a slight uptick. In this economy, any uptick over last year is a positive sign.''
 The jump in demand that accompanies summer travel is just one of many factors that are driving up energy prices.
 Oil prices rose above $60 a barrel on Wednesday in New York, settling at $62.04, the highest level since November, after a weekly report from the Energy Department showed a drop in commercial inventories and gasoline production was curbed by fires at two refineries, in Texas and Pennsylvania. 
 Some analysts also say they believe that the worst of the economic slowdown may be over, even if a recovery could take a long time, infusing some optimism into the oil market. The Energy Department said recently that oil prices had risen after suggestions the economy ''may have reached a turning point in the current recession.'' 
 ''Oil prices have improved markedly in recent weeks, largely on ostensible signs that the global economy has begun its long-awaited recovery,'' according to a report by PFC Energy, a consultancy. ''But while evidence is mounting that the worst of the contraction is behind us, a broad economic recovery is still some time away.''
 Oil markets are also weighing the effect on global supplies of a fresh round of violence in the Niger Delta, Nigeria's oil-rich region. Last week, the Nigerian government started its biggest military offensive in the delta in years, mounting helicopter raids and naval attacks on militant camps. 
 The largest rebel group in the region, the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, responded with calls for ''an all-out war'' and said it blew up two pipelines over the weekend. 
 The fighting is threatening to further disrupt supplies from Nigeria, Africa's top oil and gas exporter. Security forces clashed with militants on Tuesday near a flow station operated by Chevron in the western part of the Niger Delta, according to a report from Reuters. On Wednesday, Eni, the Italian oil company, said it was invoking emergency contract provisions that allow it to suspend export obligations at its Brass River terminal in the delta.
 Nigeria's state oil company, NNPC, said there had been no significant impact on oil production so far. ''The success of the military campaign means that production can go on,'' Levi Ajuonuma, a spokesman for the company, told Reuters. 
 Higher prices will be the main topic on the agenda of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, whose members meet next week in Vienna to consider new production targets for the next few months. More than anything else, it was action by the members of the OPEC cartel that has helped push prices up since the beginning of the year. 
 After peaking at a record close of $145.29 a barrel last summer, oil prices slumped to a closing low of $33.87 a barrel by December as global credit markets froze and the global economy went into a tailspin.
 In response, OPEC members agreed to cut their output by 4.2 million barrels during several rounds of feverish meetings over the last eight months, helping set a floor on the market. 
 Despite the recent market rally and fragile optimism about the state of the economy, oil consumption in the United States, and across much of the world, still remains weak. In its latest monthly report, the International Energy Agency estimated that daily average oil consumption in 2009 would drop to 83.2 million barrels, a drop of 2.6 million barrels, or 3 percent, from last year. 
 ''The pace of contraction is close to early 1980s levels, with a growing consensus that economic and oil demand recovery will be deferred to 2010,'' the energy agency said. ''A quick recovery remains so far elusive.''
 In the United States, oil demand has dropped without interruption for 15 months. According to the energy agency, oil demand fell by 5.9 percent in March, compared with the same time last year. 
 But the Memorial Day weekend could reverse that trend, if only temporarily, analysts said. 
 ''You give the American consumers a reduction in price and consuming confidence is getting slightly better, I think people go back and take their vacations,'' said Lawrence Goldstein, an energy analyst. ''They don't go on a spending binge, but they ease up a little bit.''

HEADLINE: In Vegas, One Death Silences Many Voices

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS 

 BODY:
 The dozens of framed photographs that once lined the backstage walls are stacked now on the floor. Danny Gans with Kevin Costner. Danny Gans with Sly Stallone. Danny Gans with Florence Henderson. Danny Gans with Morey Amsterdam. So many celebrities, all wearing that camera-ready grin.
 But in the dressing room, things remain as Danny Gans laid them out in his meticulous way, arrayed on a table for the next performance that never came: his Kermit the Frog puppet; silver Michael Jackson glove; Ray Charles glasses; Elvis glasses; George Burns glasses and wooden prop cigar.
 This is part of what was left behind by Danny Gans, a man famous for not being all that famous. He died in his sleep a couple of weeks ago -- suddenly, as they say, because he was only 52, and as attentive to his health as he was to his impressions of Frank, Sammy and Dino.
 He also leaves his wife and three children; more than a dozen employees in need of work; a darkened casino theater in need of acts; and a surreal city struggling with the reality of a hit to its economy and psyche. 
 It may seem strange that one man -- an impressionist, of all people -- could have such an impact, but you have to understand the loss in Vegas terms. This wasn't just anybody who died; this was Danny Gans.
 The city fairly shouted his name, from massive billboards, from the tops of hundreds of taxis, from the lips of all those cabdrivers and casino workers he courted over the years. When visitors asked what was a good show to see, 10-to-1 the cabbie would say, Danny Gans.
 ''They'd be bombarded with Danny Gans,'' says Chip Lightman, his longtime friend and agent. ''You couldn't go anywhere without seeing Danny Gans.''
 Mr. Gans was a show business anomaly, with no movie or television career to speak of and a long-ago one-man show on Broadway that lasted a week. Still, when he died he was grossing $18 million a year as a sure bet to lure people into the casinos that hired him, which is what it's all about.
 He had no tigers, no scantily clad assistants, no fireworks -- only a seven-piece band, a prop or two, and the uncanny ability to summon the voices of dozens of celebrities a night. In singing a duet of ''Unforgettable,'' for example, he would channel both Nat King Cole and Natalie Cole.
 Although he freshened his material by imitating singers like John Mayer and Jason Mraz, his act often echoed Johnny Carson's ''Tonight Show,'' and not only because of his Carnac the Magnificent bit. He was still doing Forrest Gump, and George Burns rapping about Viagra, and a straight-on Sammy Davis Jr. -- even though younger audience members might vaguely know the gifted Davis only as the black sidekick in the creepy-cool Rat Pack.
 Some critics mocked Mr. Gans for playing it safe; there even sprouted a Web site dedicated to ridiculing him. But they seemed not to understand his mission: to pull people into the general vicinity of the gaming tables and slots; to make them laugh, sing and forget about things, like the odds.
 ''The key thing is to sell tickets,'' says Dave Ringenbach, 57, a longtime member of Mr. Gans's band who chokes up when remembering a boss he calls kind and grounded. Some would complain that Mr. Gans was still doing ''that Burns guy,'' Mr. Ringenbach says. ''But people still want to hear that. You shoot for the middle.''
 For 13 years, Mr. Gans hit the middle. Two years ago, while working in the Danny Gans Theater at the Mirage, he announced in a newspaper advertisement that he had reached $200 million in box office sales -- one measure of one man's impact on the Vegas economy.
 Along the way he developed a contradictory mystique of being modest and egotistical, religious and standoff-ish. Even at home, he preserved his voice by communicating with family members through notes and text messages. But Mr. Lightman says this was a misinterpretation of a man keeping his silent distance; Mr. Gans was a regular guy merely protecting his asset.
 Sitting outside the quiet theater Mr. Gans once filled, his children -- Amy, 21, Andrew, 19, and Emily, 14 -- say he was a homebody, someone they called the Walgreen's King because he was always buying paper to write take-out-the-garbage notes.
 Mr. Gans left the Mirage late last year and crossed the neon-giddy Strip for the Encore, where the casino magnate Steve Wynn was looking for an act to replace ''Spamalot.'' This was a reunion of sorts, since Mr. Wynn had signed Mr. Gans to work at the Mirage years earlier, shortly before selling it.
 More than anything, though, this was a business deal. Mr. Wynn spent $2 million to refurbish the 1,500-seat theater, which he says had been ''Spamalotted'' up. His marquees glowed with two words: Danny Gans.
 Mr. Gans opened at the Encore in early February, about the time the national recession was making the typical Vegas experience seem more delusional than decadent. Gaming, hotels, visitors -- all way down. Now put your hands together for Danny! Gans!
 Mr. Wynn, sitting amid his private suite of offices in front of a portrait of himself with Frank and Dino, says he can't put a price on Mr. Gans's impact because a performer's worth to a casino is a ''murky kind of calculus.'' But no question, there was a bump in the Encore's business -- at the gaming tables and in the restaurants -- when 1,200 people a night came to see the man of many voices.
 ''Danny Gans added to the customer experience,'' Mr. Wynn says.
 Three weeks ago, Mr. Gans closed his show with his Apollo Theater tribute, which threw the band off a little because lately he had been ending by singing ''The Curtain Falls.'' (''As they say in this biz, That's all there is ... there isn't anymore.'') 
 The next day, an off day, he played golf, felt more tired than usual, and went to bed, sleeping through dinner. He did not wake up.
 Danny Gans soon became more famous in death than in life, as a familiar local story went international: How he turned to entertainment after an injury ended his baseball career; how Las Vegas allowed him to stop traveling; how he was a devout Christian and family man who raised millions for local charities.
 But this is Las Vegas. Although the Clark County Coroner's Office has yet to reveal the cause of death of one Daniel Davies Gans, hyperventilating bloggers continue to swap dark speculations about depression, and on and on. Meanwhile, the entertainer who replaced him at the Mirage, the ventriloquist Terry Fator, made a strange offer to Mr. Gans's spirit.
 ''I don't know how long he's going to be hanging around the earth,'' Mr. Fator said during a television interview. ''But if he wants to come and see my show, I'd love to have him, and I'll do him proud.''
 Mr. Lightman, Mr. Gans's manager, cringes at all the gossip and hollow sentiment. The man had just finished writing his autobiography and was working on a DVD of his show, Mr. Lightman says. ''This was a very happy time in Danny's life.''
 These days the manager is trying to find jobs for the band members, the sound and lighting crew, the theater ushers and others who depended on one man for a living. He is also working on getting the book and DVD out, which would be a good thing, because in less than three weeks that once-ubiquitous name has all but disappeared from the Strip.

HEADLINE: Open-Book Management's Lessons for Detroit

BYLINE: By DARREN DAHL

 BODY:
When the United Automobile Workers union was granted a 55 percent ownership stake in Chrysler as part of the company's plan to save itself under a bankruptcy filing, more than a few eyebrows went up. In Detroit, after all, there has long been a distinct line between owners and workers. 
 To assess what these changes might mean, I recently spoke with Jack Stack, a leading figure in both the open-book management and employee-ownership movements. At 19, having already been kicked out of both college and a Catholic seminary, Mr. Stack took a factory job with International Harvester. In 1982, he led a management buyout of a failing Harvester plant in Springfield, Mo., eventually turning the factory into SRC Holdings, a collection of 11 holding companies, 26 employee-owned businesses, and 1,200 employees that make, among other things, auto engines and home furnishings. 
 Along the way, Mr. Stack, now 60 and the chief executive of SRC, has become an apostle for open-book management, which encourages company owners to open up their books and expose their financial results to their employees in the belief that the employees will make better decisions and be more committed. He is the author (with Bo Burlingham) of two books, ''The Great Game of Business'' (Broadway Business, 1994) and ''A Stake in the Outcome'' (Broadway Business, 2003), that stress the value of empowering employees. A condensed version of our conversation follows.
 Q.What's your reaction to the U.A.W.'s becoming the majority owner of Chrysler?
 A. I think you have an interesting chemistry of cultures. It will be interesting to see if they collaborate or collide. For a long time it was the union's position that ownership is the bad guy. There is a long history of confrontation there. 
 Q.Don't you think that making the employees owners can be a good thing?
 A. Yes, but they face challenges. 
 Q.Such as?
 A. The first thing they have to realize is that they need to create a sense of accountability before they can be successful. With equity comes ownership and responsibility. They need to learn to be for the company as a whole and not just their own interests.
 Q.Do you have any advice for them?
 A. I have always used open-book management as a pattern changer. I sit someone down with a balance sheet and a case of beer and open it up and say here's what it is. We're staying here either until you understand how to read a balance sheet or we get drunk. They need to find something like this that creates that collaborative spirit, that fire in the belly. 
 Q.How does open-book management create a collaborative spirit?
 A. The downturn really hit our engine remanufacturing business hard in November. Our plant was faced with a six-month gap in orders, which was trouble. The entire plant collaborated on how to schedule their workloads -- they basically had to take eight hours out of their work week to save money until we could get back on a full schedule. Because everyone knew the numbers, they scrambled to find new products and clients, like the post office, to fill the gap faster. The result was that we lost money in December and January but we were back to full employment in February. And we didn't do this through the old command-and-control method; everybody knew the gravity of the situation, and all the great ideas came from within. That's how open book drives collaboration. 
 Q.What other role models can the new owners of Chrysler look to as an example of what you're talking about?
 A.Harley-Davidson is open book, and they have great collaboration with the union there. Open book has helped them innovate and create new product lines and diversification throughout the company. Everyone there has a passion for their company. They love to wear those Harley colors. They have a parking lot where I don't think they let anyone ride in unless they're on a Harley. That's the lesson for the automotive industry -- that it's about people who want to buy the car that they make. 
 Q.Are there other lessons you think the industry needs to learn to become successful again?
 A. At the end of the day it's about relationships, and I think that too many American automakers didn't like anybody. I often got the feeling that they didn't like their employees, their suppliers, their dealers and even their shareholders. At some point, I think they needed to ask themselves who they did like. I participated in several roundtable discussions that wanted to drum up some solutions for the industry. And my solution has always been about building relationships. If you go into a Toyota factory, for example, they have tremendous relationships with their people. When they invest capital in something, they do it to make a worker's job easier, not to eliminate his job. 
 Q.Of course, Toyota is struggling as well these days.
 A. That's simply a product of the down economy. But they haven't lost their focus on building relationships. That means that when the economy comes back, they'll be in a perfect position to come back strong with it.
 Q. Do you think open-book management could save the automotive industry?
 A. Just because you open the books doesn't mean doves and rainbows will fly out of them. What it does do is let people face the competitive reality of the marketplace. Rather than having some engineer with a stopwatch trying to get people to work faster for less money, open book gives everyone the chance to see what they need to do to succeed. In a macro sense, I believe that lack of open book has created this meltdown we are in today. We need to undo 100 years of top-down management practice. That means we need to start from scratch.

HEADLINE: Deere Posts 38% Lower Profit

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Deere & Company, the world's largest maker of agricultural machinery, reported sharply lower quarterly earnings Wednesday as lower crop prices and concerns about the global recession weighed on demand for equipment.
 The company also cut its forecast for full-year earnings again.
 The main reason for the 38 percent decline in second-quarter profit, Deere said, was a decline in demand, particularly outside the United States and Canada.

HEADLINE: Smart Giving in a Troubled Climate

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

 BODY:
IN December, Joe and Nancy Briggs sat down in their home on Lake Canandaigua in western New York to take a hard look at their donations to charity. Their investments, like those of almost everyone else, were shrinking just as the pile of requests from charities was expanding.
 ''When things go down, no matter how much you have, you think you are poorer and therefore your tendency is to withdraw completely,'' said Mr. Briggs, a retired legal-publishing executive. ''The problem is that this is the time when you can do the most good, when you really need to give.''
So the Briggses changed their giving priorities, at least until the economy recovers. What they devised was a strategy to fit the needs of the times. ''We cut back a little on some agencies, like art galleries,'' Mr. Briggs said. ''I sent a note with each check saying we were cutting them back so we could give more for things like food banks, where they really need the money right now.'' 
 Over all, the worst economy since the 1930s has halved many stock portfolios. Bailouts have put bonds at risk of inflation. And even the best jobs no longer seem secure. On top of this, many prosperous Americans find themselves helping grown children and other relatives who are out of work through no fault of their own. A third of the jobless do not qualify for unemployment benefits.
 Many charities face not just tough times, but disaster. At some organizations, volunteer trustees, especially those on the finance committee, have grown accustomed to monthly projections of income and expenses that are soaked in ever more red ink.
 Nationwide, charities are reporting that donations are flat to down sharply, especially for organizations that rely on gifts of appreciated stock. This year, Americans are likely to harvest $426 billion in capital gains, less than half of the nearly $875 billion harvested in 2007, according to Citizens for Tax Justice, which calculated its own figures after the Congressional Budget Office decided in January not to issue its annual estimate.
 Universities and community foundations have seen their endowments ravaged, meaning they have less to give. The United Way, whose network of local organizations raises money mostly for social services, youth and health, has seen drops in donations across the country.
 WITH tax revenues falling, governments are tightening up on contracts with nonprofits and delaying or canceling new grants even though pleas for help are rising among social service agencies.
 In this environment, your past generosity makes you appealing to many organizations, regardless of what your investment statement says this month. As requests pour in, the combination of shrinking net worth and job uncertainty can be immobilizing.
 What's a donor to do?
 For starters, think like Joe and Nancy Briggs. Instead of reacting, they acted, focusing on how to do the most good given the economy.
 Peter Frumkin, a sociologist at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas, says donors operate from either of two ''master theories of giving.''
 ''One theory is direct service to individuals; the other is change through advocacy and public education,'' said Professor Frumkin, the author of ''Strategic Giving.'' 
 ''In tough times,'' he said, ''people tend to gravitate toward direct service because they want something concrete from their giving.''
 Direct service, he added, ''is like buying bonds, and advocacy like growth stocks, and so in tough times donors rebalance their giving portfolios into safer investments.'' 
 Assuming you still have the capacity to give, three techniques you can consider are conversion, deferral and triage.
 Conversion is a strategy for those who have a multiyear pledge to an endowment of a charity that needs operating cash now. Endowments are intended to build long-term stability, but without money now an organization or other agency could be forced to curtail operations sharply or to close.
 In a conversion, you propose that this year's endowment gift go all or in part to operating funds the charity can spend immediately. Because pledges can be enforceable promises, make sure that you get a written agreement that you are either reducing your commitment to the endowment or are extending the payment period.
 If the market has done more than just batter your portfolio, or job, you may need to delay your gift.
 David A. Handler, a trusts and estates lawyer with Kirkland & Ellis in Chicago, said that ''a lot of nonprofits are used to hearing at this point'' from donors who need some forbearance.
 The way to raise the issue, Mr. Handler said, is by noting that ''my commitment to you remains intact, but I don't have liquidity right now; when we have it my gifts will resume.''
 Some fund-raising executives may press for a more specific timetable. How long it will take for the stock market to recover is speculation, but Allen Sinai, chief economist at Decision Economics Inc., told clients that he thought the market had begun to recover. He cautioned, however, that ''our expectation is for a very muted bull market because the U.S. will not produce much in the way of capital gains realizations,'' in part because investors have so many losses they can use for tax purposes to offset future gains.
 Julie A. Lucas, an assistant dean who raises money for Fordham Law School in New York, said that ''people are really thinking more carefully about what they will support, and while they may have supported a broad range of causes before, many are now giving less to each or giving to fewer organizations.''
 Proposing to extend a three- or five-year pledge to seven years, Miss Lucas said, ''can bring this sigh of relief, and they say, 'That would be fantastic,' because 9 out of 10 expect the economy to come back and they just need some extra time.''
 The third technique is triage: separating out charities that will not survive without your support, and trying to assess whether they are worth saving. Letting some nonprofits go out of business troubles many donors, yet it clears out duplication and inefficiency, as well as organizations whose time has passed.
 AS executive director of the Community Resource Exchange, which provides management and technical advice to nonprofits in New York City, Fran Barrett acknowledges that she has seen ''quite a few'' nonprofits that are ''badly managed, not current, or offer mediocre services.'' But these, she said, are far fewer than those that ''are really providing excellent service, at very low costs.''
 Focusing on larger agencies, she said, ''is like saying you only eat Italian food at Olive Garden. On that approach the local chef with his own place and passion for Northern Italian cooking would not survive.'' 
 She added, ''Donors need to think carefully about scale because the larger-is-better model isn't always the best.'' 
 Professor Frumkin, the sociologist, said few donors would openly risk letting a smaller nonprofit fail by withdrawing support. Instead, he said, they tend to change larger gifts into what he calls ''nuisance grants.'' 
 ''Individuals donors have a harder time turning off the spigot,'' he said, ''so they will send a small check, $100 instead of $1,000, rather than say no.''
 In a way, that sort of cutback is what the Briggses did. They cut back on organizations they thought would survive without their help or fail even with it, and focused on organizations they were concerned would be overwhelmed with need, like food banks.
 ''This is the time people need the money, now when things are so bad,'' Mr. Briggs said, ''and whether you are feeling poorer yourself doesn't matter so much as when money was really needed you were there to help.''

HEADLINE: Israeli Companies Seek Global Profile

BYLINE: By JAMES FLANIGAN

 BODY:
ISRAEL has long been successful in combining government and private money to promote small-business innovation. Now, it wants to build larger companies to compete better in a global economy.
 Some of the country's business leaders will take that message to the Israel Conference on June 4 in Los Angeles. ''We have to enhance the Israel brand by creating big, long-term companies,'' said Eran Wagner, president of North American operations for cVidya Networks, an Israeli company that helps telecommunications companies improve their efficiency. ''And not be seen as just a bunch of people with great ideas.'' 
 He cited three global Israeli companies as examples of what smaller companies were aspiring to: Teva Pharmaceuticals; Check Point Software Technologies, a provider of Internet security options; and Amdocs, which offers software and services to improve customer experience. 
 ''For Israelis to operate on a world-company level, they must learn and apply the skills of communicating with many other kinds of people,'' said Mr. Wagner, who was born of Israeli parents in Los Angeles, but grew up in Israel and founded two companies there in the 1990s. 
 Erel N. Margalit, the founder of Jerusalem Venture Partners, spoke, too, about a global imperative. ''Israelis have a great tradition as storytellers, movie makers, educators,'' he said. ''We have to create new ways to bring those skills'' to video games and personal communications.
 Mr. Margalit said his company had nurtured numerous media and information companies that were sold to large corporations in the United States and Europe or went on to be publicly listed on Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange. But now, he said, his ambitions go beyond Wall Street. 
 Two years ago, Mr. Margalit said, his venture firm opened Animation Lab in Jerusalem, which creates animated characters and stories for films, video games and cellphone applications. The company also has offices in Santa Monica, Calif. And Jerusalem Ventures is backing half a dozen start-ups in California, including Double Fusion, which embeds ads in video games. 
 Mr. Margalit said he was also looking to the emergence of Asia in global media and information industries. ''America is the queen of content,'' Mr. Margalit said, ''but it is still in the broadcast era, while China and Korea are in the interactive age.'' He said Israel's ''creative hub'' would focus on participation in those new markets. 
 In the 1980s, Mr. Margalit, as an aide to Jerusalem's former longtime mayor, Teddy Kollek, helped bring research and development investment to Israel from I.B.M., Intel and other technology companies. Then in the 1990s, Israel's government disbursed seed money to help entrepreneurs start companies to create products and jobs. Private venture capital followed that lead and spurred the country's innovations in medical devices, bioscience and information technology. 
 Glenn Yago, director of capital studies at the Milken Institute in Santa Monica and head of the institute's center in Israel, said that ''Israeli scientists own 7,000 patents in the United States, a remarkable statistic for a country of only 7 million people'' and a gross domestic product that is only 1 percent that of the United States.
 Israel has been especially prominent in the development of arterial stents and processes in bioscience. One company, MacroCure, for example, has developed a white blood-cell therapy that spurs healing of chronic wounds, like those occurring in diabetics, in the aftermath of open-heart operations and among the bedridden and wheelchair-bound. 
 The company is now entering the process of trials in the United States for approval by the Food and Drug Administration, which Mitchell Shirvan, MacroCure's chief executive, estimated would take two years. Small companies often take on partners to help pay the cost of such trials, but ''we are going to go through the trials on our own,'' said Ran Nussbaum, managing director of Pontifax, an Israeli venture capital fund that is backing MacroCure. If the company receives approval from the F.D.A., Mr. Shirvan said, it may then seek an alliance with an American company.
 Even with the country's success in medical fields, the government and leading business people in Israel are concerned about a shortfall in the long-term financing support for bioscience projects. ''That is why we are creating new vehicles to fund life-science start-ups,'' Mr. Nussbaum said. And major efforts are under way, Mr. Yago said, to expand the Tel Aviv stock exchange and other capital markets for equity and debt investments. 
 The aim of the Israel Conference is to bring together American companies looking for sources of technological innovation and Israeli companies looking for partnerships and greater knowledge of global markets. 
 ''We want to establish the proposition that for innovation and development on a global scale, Israel is a safe bet,'' said Sharona Justman, managing director of Step Strategy Advisors, a consultant group with offices in Los Angeles, London and Tel Aviv, and an chief organizer of the conference. Though ''safe'' is not a word often associated with the Middle East or Israel, Ms. Justman noted that through years of regional tension, the economy has grown and venture capital has continued to flow to Israel.
 Sharon Rechter, an Israeli entrepreneur who founded a successful company in Los Angeles, sees different business strengths in the two countries. ''Israeli companies are great at innovation, while American managers understand strategy and scale, the kind of knowledge you need in a big market like this,'' Ms. Rechter said. 
 She is co-founder and executive vice president of BabyFirstTV, a cable and satellite television channel devoted to programs for parents of children 6 months to 3 years old. Ms. Rechter said she came to the United States in 2003 to start a Hebrew language channel, which operates from New York, before coming to Los Angeles to start BabyFirstTV with her partner, Guy Oranim, who headed major advertising agencies in Israel. 
 For programming, Ms. Rechter relies on child development experts in the United States as well as Hollywood writing talent while animation and postproduction work is done in Israel. Now four years old, BabyFirstTV is in 35 countries, in 13 languages and, Ms. Rechter estimated, ''has 120 million viewers worldwide.'' 
 Yet, she said, ''the United States remains the dominant market. It might change, but in my business, media, there is the United States, and all the other markets follow. That's why I'm here.''

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC and NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: FLINT, Mich. 

 BODY:
It is mostly vacant land now, more than 200 acres surrounded by a barbed-wire fence that once was the site of the biggest General Motors manufacturing complex in the country.
 In the 1980s, more than 27,000 workers passed through the gates every day into Buick City. But only one of its many factories is still standing, a run-down engine plant known as Flint North. 
 Just 450 workers are left there, witnesses to the dismantling of Buick City and survivors, so far, of G.M.'s financial collapse. And even as the company gets nearer to bankruptcy, they do not want to leave.
 Since 2006, G.M. has persuaded 60,000 of its hourly employees -- half of its union work force in the United States -- to take cash buyouts and give up their jobs. 
 But the workers at Flint North have passed on every offer, no matter how rich.
 They are part of the last generation of auto workers who were hired when G.M. dominated the United States market decades ago. And even with all the offers to leave, they stay, showing up for a job that is, in many cases, the only one they have ever known. 
 ''I just get up in the morning, wash up, and drive here every day,'' said O. C. Cooper, a 64-year-old machine operator at Flint North. ''It's just been a way of life.''
 Of the 61,000 workers left in G.M.'s United States factories, more than 15,000 could retire today based on age or because they have more than 30 years of service.
 Workers who have wrestled with their decision to stay say it is not an easy choice. If they were to retire, they would give up annual wages of about $60,000 for a pension worth half that. And there are no guarantees that pensions will remain intact in a bankruptcy.
 The prospect of settling into their retirement years on a G.M. pension is not the security blanket it once was, even with a one-time cash payout to ease the transition. 
 ''Everything changes when you go out there,'' said Mr. Cooper, who has been with G.M. for 42 years.
 So they keep punching the clock, building cars and engines and transmissions for as long as G.M. has work for them.
 ''For me to go out and get a job these days, at my age and with a limited skill set, where do I go?'' said Victor Brown, 55, a repairman at Flint North.
 G.M.'s most recent buyout offer ended in April, and the company said that 7,000 workers took it. At Flint North, 235 workers accepted offers. 
 That left 450 workers in the 104-year-old engine plant. About 50 of them were hired in 1985. The rest have been with G.M. since at least the Carter administration.
 A year ago, Mr. Brown and other skilled tradesmen at the plant were offered $62,500 to retire with all their benefits intact. This year, the offer shrank to $20,000, and a car voucher worth $25,000.
 After 36 years with G.M., Mr. Brown, who is divorced and putting his son through college, was not ready to take the money and run.
 ''I chose this job. It's a good job and it pays well,'' he said. ''We're working. A lot of people aren't.''
 He is taking a big chance that he can survive one more major downsizing at G.M. The automaker, which is subsisting on $15.4 billion in federal loans, needs more deep cuts to fulfill the restructuring requirements laid out by the Obama administration.
 An additional 21,000 jobs and 13 plants are slated to be eliminated in the company's latest turnaround plan, part of G.M.'s last-ditch effort to avoid a bankruptcy filing.
 The company has spent $7 billion since 2006 on buyouts, which also includes offers to workers at its former Delphi parts unit. It is questionable whether G.M. could use any future federal loans to sweeten retirement deals for workers. 
 By rejecting multiple offers, the older workers have cast their lot with G.M., for better or worse.
 ''For these workers, this isn't a stock portfolio that's going down -- it's your life at stake,'' said Harley Shaiken, a labor professor at the University of California, Berkeley. ''These jobs have been the backbone for so many communities.''
 The vast majority of the older workers are concentrated in Michigan and other Midwestern states. But a large number also work in G.M. warehouses around the country that distribute parts to dealerships.
 At two parts warehouses outside Los Angeles, where the youngest worker has been with G.M. for 24 years, only six of the 116 active workers accepted last month's retirement offer.
 Many workers believe they need to keep drawing their $28-an-hour paycheck because they do not know what will happen to their pensions if G.M. files for bankruptcy.
 ''There's a lot of fear and a lot of apprehension about retiring and then having what was promised you taken away,'' said Charles Dones Jr., financial secretary for the United Automobile Workers Local 6645 in Fontana, Calif., and a 32-year G.M. veteran.
 Under its union contract, G.M. could replace the warehouse workers with new hires at wages as low as $14 an hour.
 That may make sense for G.M., but not to workers in their mid-50s with mortgages to pay and families to support.
 The workers at Flint North are hoping to ride out whatever the future brings, including bankruptcy.
 Mark Sitarski, a 55-year-old machinist, said he figured that active workers might be treated better than retirees in court. ''Working, at least you know you've got something,'' he said. ''They can take anything away once you leave.''
 The Flint workers share a survivalist attitude for having lived through the demise of Buick City, which was closed in 1999 and demolished three years later. 
 All that is left is Flint North, which built more than 20 million of G.M.'s 3800-model V-6 engines until production ceased last August. Some workers are removing equipment and preparing to start building four-cylinder engines for the Chevrolet Volt and Cruze at a newer plant across town next year, while others still build torque converters, gears, pistons, shafts and other powertrain components.
 The plant is surrounded by crumbling and empty buildings, and dead-end streets that once led into Buick City. It is a neighborhood of boarded-up stores and near-desolate streets, with the exception of the overflowing parking lots on Sundays at the Baptist churches along Industrial Avenue across from the plant. 
 The last 450 workers feel fortunate to have another factory to go to, having seen too many friends and relatives laid off over the years.
 ''General Motors has taken good care of me,'' said Mike Stoica, 60, who started at G.M. fresh out of high school in 1967. ''I've had a good life for not having a college education and doing something I love to do.''
 That way of life is vanishing at G.M. plants across the United States, but no city has been affected like Flint. When Buick City was at its peak production in the mid-1980s, G.M. had 80,000 workers spread across the city. Now it is down to about 5,000, a number that could fall more in a bankruptcy.
 ''People talk about closing a plant,'' said Bill Jordan, president of U.A.W. Local 599 and a 32-year G.M employee. ''We closed a city here. Everything that any city had, we had here.''
 In the union hall's auditorium, an aerial photograph on the wall showed the sprawling Buick City network of factories and the lots jammed with cars. Mr. Jordan pointed to the plants one by one, saying, over and over, ''That's gone.''

PERSON: Daniel Carasso 

HEADLINE: Daniel Carasso, 103, a Pioneer of Yogurt

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
Daniel Carasso, who helped turn yogurt from an obscure ethnic food into an international staple through the Danone brand in Europe and Dannon in the United States, died Sunday at his home in Paris. He was 103. 
 The death was announced by Groupe Danone, of which Mr. Carasso was honorary chairman.
 The Danone brand owes nearly everything to Mr. Carasso, including its name. When his father, Isaac, created the yogurt in Barcelona in 1919, he named it after his son, whose nickname in Catalan was Danon, or Danny. 
 From this small start-up operation Daniel Carasso developed a global business, beginning in France in 1929, expanding to the United States during World War II and eventually reaching markets as far-flung as Mexico, Brazil and Morocco. ''My dream was to make Danone a worldwide brand,'' he said at a news conference in April to celebrate Danone's 90th anniversary. 
 Mr. Carasso was born in Thessalonika, Greece, where his Sephardic family had settled four centuries earlier after the Jews were driven out of Spain. In 1916 his father took the family back to Spain, where he became disturbed by the high incidence of intestinal disorders, especially among children.
 Isaac Carasso began studying the work of Elie Metchnikoff, the Russian microbiologist who believed that human life could be extended by introducing lactic-acid bacilli, found in yogurt and sour milk, into the digestive system. Using cultures developed at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, Isaac began producing Danone.
 At the time, yogurt was exotic. Although a traditional food in Greece, the Middle East, southeastern Europe and large parts of Asia, it was known elsewhere only to a small population of health faddists. Early on, Danone was marketed as a health food and sold by prescription through pharmacies. Gradually it found favor as a milk product that did not spoil in the heat.
 In 1923 Daniel Carasso enrolled in business school in Marseille and, the better to understand yogurt, took a training course in bacteriology at the Pasteur Institute.
 In 1929 he planted the Danone flag in France, just in time for the worldwide business slump. ''I barely realized that there was a financial crisis raging around me,'' he said at a news conference in April. ''I was too caught up in trying to find dairy stores to sell my product.''
 His efforts paid off, as the French took to this newfangled food, but in 1941 the arrival of the Nazis forced him to flee to the United States. There he formed a partnership with two family friends, Joe Metzger, a Swiss-born Spanish businessman, and his son Juan, whose flair for marketing would make Dannon a household name in the United States.
 Mr. Carasso and the Metzgers bought Oxy-Gala, a small Greek yogurt company in the Bronx, and in October 1942 began producing unflavored yogurt in half-pint glass bottles under the Americanized name Dannon. 
 Customers paid 11 cents and a 3-cent deposit. Juan washed out the returns. ''We only sold $20 worth a day, but even then we were the bigger of the two companies in the business,'' Juan Metzger, who died in 1998, told People magazine in 1980. (Joe Metzger had died in 1965.)
 The little company operated at a loss until 1947, when, in a concession to the American sweet tooth, strawberry jam was added to the yogurt. Sales took off, new flavors were added to the product line, and Dannon yogurt made the leap from specialty product to snack food and dessert. In 1959 the company was bought by Beatrice Foods.
 Mr. Carasso returned to Europe after the war to restart Danone in Spain and France. He then embarked on an aggressive campaign to expand the business by establishing Danone plants in other countries and merging with other food companies. It acquired the fresh-cheese company Gervais in 1967 and in 1973 merged with the bottle maker BSN, which was eager to expand the food side of its business. 
 The new company, BSN-Gervais Danone, bought Dannon from Beatrice Foods in 1981 and changed its name to Groupe Danone two years later. One of France's largest food conglomerates, with revenue of nearly $19 billion in 2008, it ranks first in the world in sales of fresh dairy products and second in sales of bottled water and baby foods.
 Mr. Carasso is survived by a daughter, Marina Nahmias, four grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Overtime Has Taken A Quick, Decisive Turn in This Season's Playoffs

BYLINE: By JEFF Z. KLEIN

 BODY:
It wasn't so long ago that overtime in the N.H.L. playoffs meant settling in for a long, long night in front of the television, watching into the wee hours as exhausted teams slogged into the third, fourth and even fifth extra 20-minute period.
 Those days appear to be over. This postseason has featured quick, decisive and thrilling overtimes. And while there is still plenty of time this spring for marathon extra sessions to reassert themselves, this may end up as the most concise year for playoff overtime in more than a decade. 
 As recently as the 2007 postseason, the average playoff overtime lasted nearly 20 minutes, or one full period. Lengthy overtime games had become so common that in the summer of 2006, the N.H.L. competition committee nearly passed a recommendation to go to four-on-four hockey after the first extra period to get a result more quickly.
 But the current playoffs, widely hailed as the best-played and most entertaining in many years, are different. Through Tuesday, there had been 14 overtime games lasting an average of 10 minutes 19 seconds.
 ''This entire season -- the regular season, the first round of the playoffs and second round -- have been incredibly competitive, exciting and entertaining,'' Gary Bettman, the N.H.L. commissioner, said last week after attending Game 7 of the Detroit-Anaheim quarterfinal series, which the Red Wings won when Dan Cleary scored three minutes from the end of regulation. 
 ''That's something we have strived for and built toward since coming out of work stoppage with a new economic system, changing the rules and officiating standards,'' Bettman said.
 The most recent overtime, on Tuesday night, ended after 5:14, when Detroit's Mikael Samuelsson finished a three-on-one break to give the Red Wings a 3-2 victory over Chicago, just moments after the Blackhawks nearly scored at the other end.
 Of the 14 overtime games this postseason, all but one have finished before the Zambonis were needed to resurface the ice again. Only the May 3 Detroit-Anaheim game lasted past the first extra period, ending when Todd Marchant's goal gave the Ducks a 4-3 victory after 41:15 of overtime.
 Six games lasted beyond the first overtime in 2006, and eight such games were played in 2007. It was the tail end of an era when conservative strategies and tactics of obstruction kept the ice congested and held scoring down.
 Having so many games of extreme length played havoc with network television schedules. Worse, their frequency threatened to wreck the romance of the long, long overtime beloved by hockey fans, some who remember tales of Mud Bruneteau's goal for Detroit after 116:30 of extra time in 1936.
 In the summer before the 2006-7 season, the N.H.L. competition committee considered recommending a rule change that would mandate four skaters a side after 20 minutes of overtime, on the assumption that open ice would produce a decisive goal more quickly.
 The committee, made up of five players chosen by the N.H.L. Players Association and five club officials, needed seven votes to approve the recommendation. The measure received six votes.
 ''Four-on-four for the second overtime was one vote shy of passing, but bear in mind that was in the old days of clutching and grabbing,'' said Colin Campbell, who is the N.H.L. director of hockey operations and is also the nonvoting chairman of the competition committee.
 ''These days, long overtimes are increasingly rare,'' Campbell said. ''And when they do happen, they're kind of neat.''
 League and players association officials said they did not expect the measure to come up again this summer at the competition committee meeting. 
 The N.H.L. has used four-on-four overtime during the regular season, along with a system that guarantees the loser a point in the standings, since 2000. After the lockout that wiped out the 2004-5 season, the N.H.L. abolished ties and installed a penalty-shot contest to decide a winner for games in which four-on-four overtime did not work.
 International hockey has used four-on-four overtime and penalty shootouts in Olympic and world championship tournaments since the 1992 Olympics in Albertville, France.
 The most famous instance was at the 1994 Olympics, in Lillehammer, Norway, when Peter Forsberg won the gold medal for Sweden by beating the Canadian goalie Corey Hirsch with a one-handed deke that decided the penalty shootout.

HEADLINE: What You Don't Know Makes You Nervous

BYLINE: By DANIEL GILBERT. 
Daniel Gilbert, a professor of psychology at Harvard, is the author of ''Stumbling on Happiness.'' This article can also be found online at nytimes.com/opinion, as part of the blog, Happy Days, which will explore the science of human emotion in challenging times.

DATELINE: Cambridge, Mass. 

 BODY:
 SEVENTY-SIX years ago, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took to the inaugural dais and reminded a nation that its recent troubles ''concern, thank God, only material things.'' In the midst of the Depression, he urged Americans to remember that ''happiness lies not in the mere possession of money'' and to recognize ''the falsity of material wealth as the standard of success.'' 
 ''The only thing we have to fear,'' he claimed, ''is fear itself.'' 
 As it turned out, Americans had a great deal more to fear than that, and their innocent belief that money buys happiness was entirely correct. Psychologists and economists now know that although the very rich are no happier than the merely rich, for the other 99 percent of us, happiness is greatly enhanced by a few quaint assets, like shelter, sustenance and security. Those who think the material is immaterial have probably never stood in a breadline. 
 Money matters, and today most of us have less of it, so no one will be surprised by new survey results from the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index showing that Americans are smiling less and worrying more than they were a year ago, that happiness is down and sadness is up, that we are getting less sleep and smoking more cigarettes, that depression is on the rise. 
 But light wallets are not the cause of our heavy hearts. After all, most of us still have more inflation-adjusted dollars than our grandparents had, and they didn't live in an unremitting funk. Middle-class Americans still enjoy more luxury than upper-class Americans enjoyed a century earlier, and the fin de siecle was not an especially gloomy time. Clearly, people can be perfectly happy with less than we had last year and less than we have now. 
 So if a dearth of dollars isn't making us miserable, then what is? No one knows. I don't mean that no one knows the answer to this question. I mean that the answer to this question is that no one knows -- and not knowing is making us sick. 
 Consider an experiment by researchers at Maastricht University in the Netherlands who gave subjects a series of 20 electric shocks. Some subjects knew they would receive an intense shock on every trial. Others knew they would receive 17 mild shocks and 3 intense shocks, but they didn't know on which of the 20 trials the intense shocks would come. The results showed that subjects who thought there was a small chance of receiving an intense shock were more afraid -- they sweated more profusely, their hearts beat faster -- than subjects who knew for sure that they'd receive an intense shock. 
 That's because people feel worse when something bad might occur than when something bad will occur. Most of us aren't losing sleep and sucking down Marlboros because the Dow is going to fall another thousand points, but because we don't know whether it will fall or not -- and human beings find uncertainty more painful than the things they're uncertain about. 
 But why?
 A colostomy reroutes the colon so that waste products leave the body through a hole in the abdomen, and it isn't anyone's idea of a picnic. A University of Michigan-led research team studied patients whose colostomies were permanent and patients who had a chance of someday having their colostomies reversed. Six months after their operations, patients who knew they would be permanently disabled were happier than those who thought they might someday be returned to normal. Similarly, researchers at the University of British Columbia studied people who had undergone genetic testing to determine their risk for developing the neurodegenerative disorder known as Huntington's disease. Those who learned that they had a very high likelihood of developing the condition were happier a year after testing than those who did not learn what their risk was. 
 Why would we prefer to know the worst than to suspect it? Because when we get bad news we weep for a while, and then get busy making the best of it. We change our behavior, we change our attitudes. We raise our consciousness and lower our standards. We find our bootstraps and tug. But we can't come to terms with circumstances whose terms we don't yet know. An uncertain future leaves us stranded in an unhappy present with nothing to do but wait. 
 Our national gloom is real enough, but it isn't a matter of insufficient funds. It's a matter of insufficient certainty. Americans have been perfectly happy with far less wealth than most of us have now, and we could quickly become those Americans again -- if only we knew we had to.

HEADLINE: U.S. Insurer Of Pensions Sees Flood Of Red Ink

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The deficit at the federal agency that guarantees pensions for 44 million Americans tripled in the last six months to a record high, reaching $33.5 billion, largely as a result of surging bankruptcies among companies whose pensions it expects it will soon need to take over.
 The agency, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, faced a shortfall of just $11 billion as of October. The combined effect of lower interest rates, losses on its investment portfolio and rising numbers of companies filing for bankruptcy produced the jump in its projected deficit, officials said Wednesday. 
 Because the agency has $56 billion in assets -- most of which is invested in Treasury bonds -- it is not facing any prospect of default in the short term, officials said.
 ''The P.B.G.C. has sufficient funds to meet its benefit obligations for many years because benefits are paid monthly over the lifetimes of beneficiaries, not as lump sums,'' the agency's acting director, Vince Snowbarger, testified Wednesday at a Senate hearing. ''Nevertheless, over the long term, the deficit must be addressed.''
 The financial troubles are just a small part of the challenges facing the pension agency, which was created by Congress in 1974 and today is responsible for pension programs covering 1.3 million people. It pays about 640,000 people actual benefits worth about $4.3 billion a year.
 The P.B.G.C.'s former director, Charles E. F. Millard, was subpoenaed to testify at the hearing Wednesday. But he cited his constitutional right to avoid self-incrimination and declined to answer any questions. 
 Mr. Millard, who resigned in January, has been accused by the agency's inspector general of having inappropriate contact with companies including BlackRock, JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, all of which competed for and won contracts to help manage $2.5 billion of the agency's funds. Those contracts will now most likely be canceled.
 Employers nationwide with so-called defined-benefit, or traditional, pension plans pay fees to the P.B.G.C. in return for a promise that it will take over their pension plan if a company fails. 
 On Tuesday, for example, the agency announced that it had assumed the pension plan once run by the Lenox Group, a bankrupt maker of tableware, giftware and collectibles based in Eden Prairie, Minn. Assuming control of pensions for this company's 4,300 workers will cost the agency an estimated $128 million -- the difference between what Lenox had in its pension fund and what the total estimated obligations are.
 In the last six months, 93 companies whose pension plans are covered by the agency have filed for bankruptcy, including Chrysler, whose failure alone could cost the agency $2 billion. A bankruptcy by General Motors would make the situation worse. G.M. had 670,000 workers as of late last year in its pension system, whose collapse would cost the agency an estimated $6 billion.
 Options to close the $33.5 billion deficit include a federal bailout by taxpayers, a change in insurance premiums it charges employers or increasing its investment returns.
 Last year, the agency's board voted to allow it to shift its investment strategy to put more money into stocks, private equity and real estate, in an effort to reduce the deficit.
 If that shift had taken place, the losses would most likely have been larger. But only a relatively small amount of the funds have already been shifted to stocks, so the losses on the investment portfolio were responsible for just $3 billion of the jump in the deficit in the last six months.
 Senator Herb Kohl, Democrat of Wisconsin and chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, which held the hearing Wednesday, blamed poor supervision by the agency's board and management, at least in part, for the troubles, adding that he intended to introduce legislation that would expand the board and require it to meet at least four times a year. The board has not met in person since February 2008.
 ''The role of P.B.G.C. is too crucial to allow its governance to slip through the cracks,'' Mr. Kohl said.

HEADLINE: Edging Toward Higher Yields

BYLINE: By J. ALEX TARQUINIO

 BODY:
THE Chicken Little school of investing may have felt like a safe bet when the sky was falling. But some investors who socked away their cash in money market accounts or Treasury bonds only a few months ago are already growing tired of the monotony.
 ''The zero rate of return isn't as attractive as it used to be,'' Gary Schatsky, a fee-only financial planner in New York, said with a wry laugh. 
So Mr. Schatsky has begun nudging his clients to venture a bit farther out on the yield curve. Not way out there, mind you, but at least far enough to include high-grade corporate bonds in the fixed-income portion of their portfolios.
 Mr. Schatsky favors short-term corporate bond funds now, he said, because he worries that efforts by the Federal Reserve and the government to stimulate the economy could lead to higher inflation. ''Intermediate bonds will get smacked down if inflation picks up,'' Mr. Schatsky said.
 Because bond prices and yields move in opposite directions, if interest rates eventually rise because of inflation, the prices of existing bonds would fall.
 On the other hand, Mr. Schatsky said, should the economic situation become even gloomier, short-term bonds might be less risky than bonds with longer maturity dates. ''There is a lower probability that a company will go from solvency to bankruptcy in a year or two,'' he said.
 Tad Rivelle, chief investment officer at Metropolitan West Asset Management, a money management firm in Los Angeles that specializes in bonds, said that the debt of many large American corporations with ''fortresslike balance sheets'' had fallen to extremely low prices. He said bonds issued by General Electric, JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway were among those that are now inexpensive.
 ''The markets aren't being rational,'' Mr. Rivelle said. ''Once we get out of this difficult period, those companies will be extraordinarily profitable.''
 Many financial advisers say it is too soon for individual investors to buy funds that own lower-rated corporate bonds. Officially, these are called high-yield bond funds; unofficially, they are known as junk bond funds. 
 The high-yield bond category suffered its worst year on record in 2008, according to Morningstar. Falling bond prices pushed high-yield funds to double-digit yields, which might look tempting to some investors now. But financial advisers say the yields went so high because many investors expected bankruptcies to rise among companies with poor credit ratings.
 Aaron Gurwitz, the head of global investment strategy at Barclays Wealth, a division of London-based Barclays Bank, said that it was too soon for individual investors to own high-yield bonds, but that they should own high-grade corporate bonds, either through a diversified mutual fund or a separately managed account. 
 ''We are advising clients to move from a very defensive position to a less defensive position,'' Mr. Gurwitz said.
 A large part of the appeal of owning bonds, for many investors, has historically been the income from interest payments. This can be especially true for investors who are either in retirement or getting close to it. But in recent years, many investors who were seeking yield emphasized stocks, because federal taxes were lower for dividends than for interest.
 This strategy has hit many investors hard in recent months, said David Darst, the chief investment strategist for Morgan Stanley's Global Wealth Management Group. He said the steady stream of dividend cuts had taken a huge toll on investors who were relying on their stock portfolios for income.
 Traditionally, Mr. Darst said, income investors tilted toward stock sectors like banking and real estate -- precisely where dividends have recently been in retreat. So Mr. Darst has started recommending that clients who are worried about dividend cuts move some assets to high-grade corporate bonds from stocks.
 Because of the relatively unfavorable tax treatment of bonds, Mr. Schatsky recommended owning most bonds -- except tax-exempt municipal bonds -- in a tax-sheltered account, like an individual retirement account or a 401(k).
 Like many investment advisers, he also emphasized the importance of owning low-cost mutual funds, particularly with fixed-income funds, because the annual expenses directly reduce the yield. Even slight differences in bond fund expenses can add up when compounded over time.
 And Mr. Schatsky strongly cautioned individual investors against owning corporate bonds directly. ''For people who have their own bond portfolios, certainly this is a nightmarish time to sell,'' Mr. Schatsky said. ''The market is extremely thin.''

HEADLINE: In Selling a Boat, No Port in a Storm

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
LAST month, my wife and I sold Sea Paws, the boat we loved. We are about to have our first child and decided it made sense to unload the 30-foot cabin cruiser we barely used anymore. But it wasn't easy -- and the economy was only the half of it.
 We bought the boat a few weeks after we got married, named it for our dogs and decided to moor it in Naples, Fla., where we were spending a lot of time. 
 It was a completely frivolous purchase, but we were basking in a post-honeymoon glow. My wife had grown up around boats and loved them; I was at best indifferent to them. I had lived a happy nonboating life and had never enjoyed getting bounced around in her father's much smaller boat.
 As we walked into the Marine Max dealer that day, my wife bet me that the yacht broker would talk to me first. She was right, but I set him straight.
 ''Do you have any boats with blue hulls? That's what I'd like,'' I said, making my ignorance apparent. They didn't. 
 From there, my wife took over, and a couple of hours later, it had come down to two Sea Ray Sundancers. One was a new 260; the other was a 280 that was two years old but with just a few hours on the engines. They were both oceangoing boats and basically the same price: in the high five figures. The difference was the length (about three feet) and the width, or beam, which determined how steady the boat would be on the water. I voted for the 280 and began to envision finally swamping other boats, payback for all those times I'd been swamped on rides with my father-in-law. 
 That was two years and scores of great outings ago. We never had a bad experience with Sea Paws, until we decided last New Year's Day that she had to go. What were we thinking by trying to sell a boat in the worst recession in memory?
 I had given in to the economic reality: it would cost almost $20,000 to ship the boat to Connecticut, where we live now, and dock it for a year. With the baby due in August, I couldn't see us using it much. In our minds, we would sell it for 10 percent less than the purchase price. After all, we had been told the 280 Sundancer was a popular model for boaters in Naples who were looking to trade up or down.
 It sure was. In a market flooded with repossessed boats and desperate sellers, there were plenty of similar boats to choose from. Scott, our broker, said that a year earlier buyers couldn't even find used boats but this year there were often 10 of the same make within 100 miles. Succumbing a second time to the economic reality, we listed Sea Paws for 25 percent less than we had paid.
 In the months that followed, Scott talked in bursts on the phone but engendered confidence. For one, he flattered me -- calling our boat a 9.5 out of 10 when similar ones were 6's. And he also produced bidders.
 AT first, they were not the bidders we wanted. They were bottom feeders who spent the winter swaggering through Naples thinking they could buy up the town for back-home prices. 
 One man stood out, the owner of a flooring company in Wisconsin who fashioned himself a wheeler-dealer. For weeks, he would make a low offer, walk away when we rejected it and return after he saw some broken-down boat for what he had just offered for Sea Paws. Then he would make a slightly higher offer and the cycle would begin again.
 My biggest problem was taking the emotion out of the sale. Sea Paws wasn't a stock or a bond. It was my first boat, and I loved the hours I had spent driving it with my wife next to me. One of our last excursions had been to an abandoned observatory south of Marco Island: we dropped anchor and had lunch with no one around us. 
 But just after Easter, Sea Paws sold. How did we do it in this market? We lowered our expectations and took comfort in the fact that we owned the boat outright. We were going to lose money, but at least we weren't going to owe a bank for the balance of the loan. 
 Scott swore to us that our boat had sold quickly and for a good price. But what else would he say? In the end, it went for 30 percent less than the purchase price. We consoled ourselves by saying that we could have gotten an even worse return in the stock market.

HEADLINE: Tweeting Your Way To a Job

BYLINE: By LAURA M. HOLSON

 BODY:
''IT is my mission in life to get this job,'' said Amanda Casgar, who is better known to executives at Murphy-Goode Winery in Sonoma County as applicant No. 505.
 Three weeks ago Murphy-Goode began a search for a ''social media whiz,'' a wine enthusiast interested in moving to Healdsburg, Calif., for six months to promote the vineyard's malbec and chardonnay on blogs, Facebook and Twitter. The job -- which comes with the official title ''lifestyle correspondent'' -- pays $10,000 a month, plus free accommodations at a private home within walking distance of the tasting room. Ms. Casgar, a former magazine marketing executive, has been endorsing herself as enthusiastically as she would a bottle of petit verdot.
 Already an occasional Twitterer, she increased the number of tweets she posts; they are mostly about wine. She created a Web site, ''Goode Times With Amanda Casgar,'' to chronicle her job quest. Like about a half-dozen other eager applicants, she has started a fan group on Facebook, buying ads for 50 cents a click to generate traffic. 
 And last week Ms. Casgar spent two days filming her video resume, rejecting the idea to sing a rap song (''I want to demonstrate my personality without being too cheesy or a loser,'' she explained) in favor of a sketch dubbed ''random acts of wineness.''
 Talk about investing in the future. The position of social media specialist, introduced by companies like Comcast, General Motors and JetBlue Airways, has become the hottest new corporate job among the Twitterati. To marketers, it seems, personal relations have become the new public relations. 
 Of course companies have been seeking to exploit the marketing possibilities of social media for years -- remember all those corporate storefronts in Second Life? Politicians and actors, too, have become adept at bypassing mainstream media to interact directly with fans (and foes). But only recently have companies begun hiring someone specifically for the task, largely because of the explosive popularity of Twitter. 
 To some, Twitter is an extension of customer service, an efficient way to solve problems for disgruntled customers. To others, the use of interactive media is strictly promotional: PepsiCo, for instance, recently advertised that it was looking for journalists and students to tweet during Internet Week in New York in June.
 Having a social media aficionado on staff is one way to create conversation about a brand, the same way hip-hop record executives in the 1990s used urban street teams to promote new musicians. And it is a rare example these days of a growth industry: Forrester Research, a research and marketing firm, has 12 analysts advising more than 100 companies on how to use social networks to get customers to do things like open bank accounts or buy more face cream.
 ''Twitter has gotten to this place that everyone is interested in it,'' said Josh Bernoff, a Forrester analyst and co-author of a book about social technologies. But interest does not equal ability, he said. The qualities that make someone a good social media maven -- which include being available round-the-clock to anyone who writes -- are different than the skills used by mainstream corporate publicists.
 ''They are not acting like spokespeople, but real people,'' Mr. Bernoff said. ''You have to be careful about what you say while, at the same time, be much more personal than the average corporate P.R. guy. You need people who understand the mores and etiquette. Not everyone knows how to do that.''
 Of course, any new technology has its limits. Twitter, for instance, was not devised to solve complex problems, and companies that tweet too much run the risk of irritating people. ''It is not right for saying anything meaningful,'' said Paul Gillin, a technology journalist who wrote a book about using social media for marketing. ''All anyone has to do is tweet their dissatisfaction and a company will cave in to their demands,'' he said. ''It does little to encourage loyalty.''
 At some companies, only those with a bold personality and a dab hand at Twitter need apply. Consider @Christi5321 or, as her friends and family know her, Christi Day, a bubbly 25-year-old specialist in emerging media at Southwest Airlines. ''I like to be the center of attention,'' said Ms. Day, a former cheerleader. ''I was on the dance team at Texas Christian University. I love an audience. I compare Twitter to a bar or a social event.'' The people who get the most attention, she said, ''have a story to tell.'' 
 At Southwest, a company known for its offbeat sensibility, that story can be as personal as she wants. That means tweeting about the sunburn she got on a photo shoot one recent afternoon. Or responding ''yes'' to a man who once asked, ''Am I the only person who thinks Southwest is overrated?'' Ms. Day added: ''I have a lot of people Twittering about the celebrities they see on flights. I love celebrity gossip, so I get pretty excited.'' A case in point? ''Someone just saw Vanessa Hudgens,'' she said with a giggle.
 ''The company has given us freedom to be ourselves,'' Ms. Day said of Southwest employees. ''As long as I am accurate and on message, I can be as quirky as I am.'' 
 Despite her happy-go-lucky persona, Ms. Day's primary goal is to spin Southwest's image in its favor. She does this by watching what consumers are saying about the airline 24 hours a day and snuffing out complaints before they snowball. (Yes, she sleeps, although the first thing she does when she gets up is check her Twitter account.)
 ''Things like Facebook are just another channel,'' she said. ''I will stay on Twitter as long as I have to to monitor a situation.'' A few weeks ago she was curled up on the couch watching TV with her boyfriend when she noticed she had 48 e-mail messages. A tire had blown out on a plane as it landed. ''I went into work mode right away,'' she said. She not only e-mailed her bosses, but she also spent the evening monitoring posts on Twitter. 
 ''It instantly killed the mood,'' she said. ''You have to find someone who really loves the company.''
 Add to that a thick skin and sense of humor. Gawker recently posted a Twitter exchange between Morgan Johnston of JetBlue and @meaghano who, apparently, really liked JetBlue's new terminal at Kennedy Airport.
 ''I want to make love to the @jetblue terminal,'' meaghano wrote.
 ''I hope you'll at least by the terminal dinner first!'' Mr. Johnston quickly replied.
 Instead of being chided by his bosses for being inappropriate (or his spelling of ''buy''), Mr. Johnston, 31, said he was applauded for his irreverence. ''In this medium, it's all about the conversation,'' he said, ''it's not going with the company line.'' 
 Of course, finding a voice takes time. David Puner, or Dunkin' Dave as he is known to the 21,195 people who follow @DunkinDonuts on Twitter, has been tweeting since October, posting more than 1,000 messages. ''I don't go beyond a certain point,'' said Mr. Puner, 35, a former television producer and freelance writer. ''I wouldn't swear. With tweets, I write out what I want to say. The hardest thing is editing myself. I like to go off on tangents.''
 To start the day, he will often scan what others are saying about Dunkin' Donuts and re-tweet the most positive comments. Recently he said he told his tweeps (Twitter followers) he was going to a Bruce Springsteen concert wearing a pink Dunkin' Donuts cape. So did he? ''I didn't really do that,'' he said. ''I'm not the type to shoot T-shirts out of a cannon into the crowd.''
 Nor, apparently, is David Ready Jr., the winemaker at Murphy-Goode, who says the new social media gig is meant to attract younger customers (the average age of a wine drinker is 52, he said). ''It doesn't have to be a sommelier, but someone passionate about wine,'' he said. ''We want someone who people will want to follow.''
 Already the campaign is paying dividends: nearly 600 people have applied to Murphy-Goode, and the deadline is June 19. The company's Web site has had 50,000 page views since the job contest was introduced.
 But there have been drawbacks, too. During a recent interview Mr. Ready was asked if he used Twitter. When he said no, his publicist gave him a stern warning. ''She told me to stop telling them I don't have a Twitter account,'' he said. ''But then I thought, 'Aren't we hiring someone to do that for us?' ''

HEADLINE: More Investors, Chastened by Stock Losses, Settle for Municipal Bonds

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
THE historic lure of most municipal bonds has been their tax-free returns. But the recession and the rash of corporate troubles have widened their appeal to investors wary of the stock market who want to settle for a steady if unspectacular return.
 Municipal bonds are still the terrain of high earners, who like their safety and higher tax-adjusted return than Treasury bonds. But increasingly average retail investors have been buying them to fill out their bond allocations. ''Our average account has increased their asset allocation in fixed income to 52 percent and most of that is in munis,'' said Robert Everett, director of fixed income at the Boston Private Bank and Trust Company. He said that was an increase of 15 percentage points from last year. 
 Even though the major stock markets have risen in the last month, uncertainty about the rally abounds. Suddenly, the return on a municipal bond of 6 to 7 percent, including the tax exemption, seems great. 
 The other draw has been safety. Historically, the default rate on investment-grade munis is less than a quarter of a percent, compared with almost 2 percent for corporate bonds. And the difference in yield between United States Treasuries and munis has recently been as much as 2.5 percent. 
 Given the pressure on city and state coffers, the default rate is likely to rise closer to 1 percent. But that is far lower than the yields on munis suggests, said George Strickland, a managing director at Thornburg Investment Management of Santa Fe, N.M. ''The market thinks 20 percent of investment grade issuers will default in the next 10 years,'' he said. ''The major muni issuers are doing well.'' 
 Being selective with munis is key. The first risk investors need to understand is the difference between general obligation and revenue bonds. General obligation bonds are sold to finance the daily operations of a municipality. Legally, that entity is obligated to do whatever it needs -- from cutting services to raising taxes -- to make its bond payments. 
 A revenue bond is sold to finance particular projects like hospitals, utilities and stadiums. The receipts from such projects are used to make the bond payments, and many investors have started to wonder how these will hold up.
 ''Stay away from revenue bonds, backed by projects like a parking lot at a university,'' warned Gregg S. Fisher, chief investment officer of Gerstein Fisher, an investment advisory firm in New York. ''If cars stop showing up, then you could have trouble getting your money.''
 Hospital bonds also need to be evaluated carefully. ''Community hospitals with A and BBB ratings are feeling the pinch because people without insurance go to them and can't pay,'' said Ronald J. Sanchez, director of fixed income strategies at Fiduciary Trust, a unit of Franklin Templeton Investments. ''You need to avoid certain segments with greater risk.'' 
 This points to another issue: liquidity. Roughly $360 billion of new bonds are sold annually. New York and California are the benchmark issuers and their bonds are traded often. But there are scores of municipalities that sell bonds that buyers may have to hold for their duration because of illiquid markets. 
 Munis are traded in an over-the-counter fashion, which means finding a price quote, let alone a buyer, can be difficult at times. Although small investors make up a good part of this market, the Securities and Exchange Commission has no role in its regulation.
 But for those aware of the risk, there are investing opportunities. During the first quarter, few municipalities sold bonds because they were waiting to see what the stimulus plan would bring them. Now, cities and states are making up for lost time.
 Several portfolio managers advise that shorter-dated munis are safer. ''The longer the duration the more volatility,'' said Mr. Strickland, who likes the two- to three-year range.
 Diversification is also being pushed for munis. Historically investors have concentrated on bonds from their state to get the full tax deduction. But owning bonds from other states could give them a greater return, as in the case of California, where a fiscal crisis has pushed up yields.
 The recession has brought about new securities, known as Build America Bonds, to help ailing municipalities raise money. They allow municipalities to sell taxable bonds for capital projects while receiving a rebate from the federal government for a portion of their borrowing costs. The program is meant to attract institutional investors who typically do not buy munis. But they could also suit a retail investor who wants to put them in a taxable retirement account.

HEADLINE: Furniture Comes Out to Play

BYLINE: By MARIANNE ROHRLICH

 BODY:
THE recession might have cast a pall over the retail market this past winter, but there seemed to be hope for home design -- at least on the part of those who sell it -- in the halls of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center this week. 
 There were 552 exhibitors at this year's International Contemporary Furniture Fair -- about 50 fewer than last year -- but those who came brought plenty of newly designed products, many of them made in places like Brooklyn and Los Angeles. 
 And after the ascendancy of dark woods and vintage references in recent seasons, this show was notable for bright colors, simple forms and a preponderance of environmentally friendly and unstained reclaimed woods.

HEADLINE: How to Build a Successful C.E.O.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''In Praise of Dullness,'' by David Brooks (column, May 19):
 After 17 years as an investor relations officer for Taft Broadcasting in Cincinnati and Knight Ridder in San Jose, I concluded that successful chief executives combine four abilities: 
 The ability to allocate cash flow for growth. Without growth, little else matters. 
 The ability to pick the right managers for the operating jobs. C.E.O. ''vision'' is largely realized through the people in the critical posts. 
 The ability to inspire the troops. Charisma comes in many colors; getting others to be excited about the mission is one of them. 
 The ability to be aware of and understand all the moving parts. Chief executives don't need in-depth knowledge of every discipline -- accounting, marketing, sales, benefits, taxes and so on -- but they need to know enough about each one to ask the right questions.
 None of these four are easy, and in combination, they are very hard to find.
 Polk Laffoon IV Cincinnati, May 19, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Leaving aside the questions that any leadership researcher would have about David Brooks's column, let's assume the validity of the broad conclusion that execution is more important than ''people skills.'' 
 Here's a straightforward way to look at leader effectiveness: 
 Charisma helps a leader influence other people (particularly in the short run), and sheer competence closes the deal (particularly over time). Academic research has made clear the things that confer ''charisma'' on a leader, including having a compelling vision, communicating it persuasively, and giving appropriate attention to people as individuals.
 Leader competence involves solving important problems and creating and capitalizing on high-potential opportunities, sometimes directly by the leader but also by motivating others to do the same. Still missing from the leadership formula are ethics and integrity -- call it character, for the sake of alliteration. We then have a pretty powerful equation -- competence plus charisma plus character -- for outstanding leadership.
 Thomas S. Bateman Charlottesville, Va., May 19, 2009
 The writer is a professor and management area coordinator, McIntire School of Commerce, University of Virginia.
 To the Editor:
 I am less concerned about good chief executives and more about what makes a good company. Now, a good company is defined by profit. This leads to unethical and illegal acts undertaken to increase profits. Examples are rife in every newspaper. 
 Corporate profits should be sought within a context of ''do no harm.'' This would entail that corporations stop externalizing costs. Corporations should pay for the true costs of their actions. Pollutants should be cleaned up when they are created -- the longer one waits, the harder they are to clean up (usually at taxpayer expense). 
 Resource extraction should always include environmental restoration. Worker protections should be held to the highest standards to reduce public health care costs. 
 Externalizing corporate costs is more damaging and expensive than dealing with those costs up front. But it is not only the expense. Typically, corporate externalized costs are paid by our tax dollars.
 Anne Johnson Brownsburg, Ind., May 19, 2009
 To the Editor:
 David Brooks cites some interesting data with regard to what makes a successful chief executive, and contrasts this with the qualities that make a successful politician. But then he concludes that the Obama administration's incursion into the business world will result in the promotion of charisma over competence in that sphere, at the cost of our competitive edge. It seems to me that he's got it exactly backward. 
 Visionary leadership skills and nuts-and-bolts competence need not be mutually exclusive. As Mr. Brooks himself has observed in the past, this president and the people with whom he's surrounded himself are the very model of diligence, analytical thoroughness and attention to detail.
 Rather than threatening to impose an extroverted flamboyance upon the world of business, they have brought level-headed competent leadership -- the very traits that make an excellent C.E.O. -- to the world of Washington.
 Lawrence Kaplan Ardsley, N.Y., May 19, 2009
 To the Editor: 
 David Brooks relates the not-unintuitive findings that the most effective chief executives are focused, methodical and a little dull. He then contrasts business leaders with politicians and laments that politicians are now effectively running major companies and industries.
 But President Obama has encouragingly shown signs of being a methodical leader focused on steady incremental change with emotional stability. His predecessor, an M.B.A. president by contrast, was an extrovert with name recognition and little humility who endorsed the equivalent of splashy product rollouts (the ''Mission Accomplished'' banner), exactly the type of leader Mr. Brooks suggested makes a poor executive.
 Perhaps good politicians and good business executives are not that different after all.
 V. John Ella Minneapolis, May 19, 2009
 To the Editor:
 David Brooks offers that the model of the successful American business executive -- persistent, efficient and analytic -- will not work in Washington because the model of the successful national politician is charismatic, charming and personable. This may be true, but Mr. Brooks misses his own point.
 Any model of the successful American C.E.O. is suspect today. The state of the economy invalidates corporate leadership that was not prepared for and moreover may have contributed to the mess we are in.
 Charlie Haviland Franklin, Mich., May 19, 2009
 To the Editor:
 If what David Brooks says is true, then C.E.O.'s are interchangeable spare parts, not brilliant, one-of-a-kind, irreplaceable, indispensable leaders, and thus should not be paid any more than middle management. 
 The chief executive as rock star, deserving of unimaginably astronomical compensation, is a self-serving lie and must be rejected immediately.
 Thomas N. Beck East Windsor, N.J., May 19, 2009

HEADLINE: Time for A New Strategy

BYLINE: By TARA SIEGEL BERNARD

 BODY:
IF the last 18 months have taught Americans anything, it's that market collapses don't discriminate. Even the most sophisticated and affluent investors lost big chunks of their fortunes. Access to the most exclusive hedge funds did not always limit the damage, as many participants had hoped it would.
 As a result, a new mentality has emerged among some investors, who are rethinking the traditional approach to asset allocation. The upheaval in the markets and in the broader economy has led them to question long-honored principles of investing and to sound a death knell, at least for now, for the buy-and-hold mind-set.
Moving away from the conventional mix of stocks, bonds and cash, many affluent investors and their advisers are turning to alternative investments -- like managed futures and hedged mutual funds -- that are liquid but behave differently from the rest of the investment pack. 
 And some of the wealthiest investors are beginning to shed the bunker mentality, at least long enough to exploit shorter-term opportunities.
 ''In an environment of extraordinary uncertainty, the traditional role of asset allocation and long-term investing is far more difficult,'' said Michael Sonnenfeldt, chief executive of Tiger 21, a forum for wealthy investors who meet monthly to discuss financial matters. ''Many of our members believe we are in a trader's market where long-term investing should be shunned but trading opportunities should be seized.'' Indeed, many investors are reluctant to place longer term bets and cling to larger cash allocations, anticipating continued volatility.
 ''The landscape going forward is extremely uncertain,'' said Hans Olsen, chief investment officer at J.P. Morgan's private wealth management unit. ''There are many possible outcomes. You need to have a portfolio structured to reflect many possible futures. It comes down to the first principles of diversification.''
 But how you define diversification is evolving. 
 ''In a bull market, we don't tend to care that our portfolio investments seem to behave the same, but I believe this bear market has uncovered a long-term problem,'' said Jerry Verseput, a financial planner in El Dorado Hills, Calif., noting that technology and globalization have diluted the effectiveness of diversification based on company size and location. So he has embraced a new approach, using a portfolio of exchange-traded funds, or E.T.F.'s, that track different sectors of the economy, like energy and health care. Below, several investment professionals describe how their philosophies have changed and how they are reallocating their portfolios. And one stalwart traditionalist explains why he thinks all of this is a lousy idea.
 BALANCING WITH ALTERNATIVES 
 George Padula, a senior wealth manager at Back Bay Financial Group in Boston, predicted that market volatility would not abate anytime soon. Indeed, with BlackBerries ubiquitous and news traveling so fast, markets react more quickly than ever, he said.
 So Mr. Padula and his colleagues came up with a way to balance their clients' short-term worries with a longer-term strategy. For most clients -- whose net worth runs from $2 million to $4 million -- they have increased cash positions and their allocations to alternative investment funds, including managed futures, which actively trade commodity, currency and financial futures contracts. 
 He invests in commodities through a diversified fund that can take long and short positions and in hedged-equity mutual funds that try to use option strategies to cushion market hits.
 This approach, obviously, includes a pullback on stocks. Mr. Padula's most aggressive portfolio now dedicates only 65 percent to stock index funds, down from 80 to 90 percent. Alternative investments account for 23 percent of that portfolio, fixed income for 8 percent and cash for 4 percent.
 The firm also created more conservative strategies for clients who no longer want sleep aids to get through the night. One such model shifts money from stock funds (down to 22 percent) into alternative investments (33 percent), fixed-income (29 percent) and cash (16 percent).
 The shifts have been well-received by clients, he said, adding, ''They recognize that circumstances are very different now than they have ever been, and proactive steps are needed to counteract the increased market risks and their reduced capacity for risk.'' 
 PASSIVE NO MORE
 Cathy Pareto, a fee-only adviser in Coral Gables, Fla., came from the passive school of investing, where you invest your portfolio in a diversified basket of index funds. But in today's world, she says, you can be too passive.
 ''Buy-and-hold was the mantra, but in light of recent events and a dramatically different world, those tenets may not always apply,'' Ms. Pareto said.
 She now dedicates 5 to 10 percent of her clients' portfolios to more tactical moves. Currently, those include sector E.T.F.'s, like consumer staples, global materials and technology, as well as an E.T.F. that bets against real estate investment trusts. ''That has been a radical change for me,'' she said.
 One thing she likes about E.T.F.'s is their trading flexibility. Unlike mutual funds, E.T.F.'s can be traded just like stocks. 
 A PASSION FOR CASH
 Paul Speargas, a senior client adviser at WMS Partners, a family office and wealth advisory firm in Towson, Md., is looking in some unlikely spots for investments -- notably those that do not move in line with the market.
 His firm has purchased streams of cash -- or discounted cash flows -- from people who have been awarded large sums of money, like lottery winnings or court settlements, but receive them as annuities. 
 ''It's a real niche,'' said Mr. Speargas, whose clients' net worth ranges from $10 million to $12 million. ''What we are doing is going through third parties to buy annuity contracts that people have been awarded.''
 That strategy is part of a low-risk core portfolio. But along the edges, the firm has been looking for short-term trading opportunities in a more predictable place: the stock market. Since mid-October, it has been actively trading shares of high-quality, large-capitalization companies with rock-solid balances sheets, he said. ''The proverbial babies thrown out with the bathwater,'' he adds, which include Google, Verizon and Nucor Steel.
 ''The buy-and-hold strategy, which was almost universally accepted by the investment and academic community over the past several decades, is no longer the sole investment strategy to be employed in order to deliver solid investment returns,'' Mr. Speargas said. ''A thoughtful balance between long-term investing and short-to-intermediate term trades is likely the recipe for investment success in the volatile years ahead.''
 A TRADITIONALIST STANDS FIRM 
 Rick Ferri, founder of Portfolio Solutions, remains a die-hard buy-and-hold investor, scoffing at many notions that some other advisers now subscribe to.
 Investors can achieve adequate diversification with a handful of index funds and E.T.F.'s, he said, though he is quick to acknowledge that the current market is a rough one. But it has not altered his view on asset allocation, and his investment philosophy remains intact: Don't take more risk than you need to achieve your financial goals, and calibrate those needs with what your stomach can handle.
 That all investments simultaneously fell did not surprise him, Mr. Ferri said, nor did he believe that the plunge undermined the benefits of diversification. Different investment types do lower portfolio risk most of the time, he said, yet diversification is likely to fail when you need it most, because riskier investments tend to move in lock step in ebullient and gloomy markets alike.
 ''What happened shouldn't be a complete shock to people who studied economic history,'' said Mr. Ferri, whose Troy, Mich., firm has about $600 million under management. It's during the more normal periods that diversification works its magic, he said.
 He has kept the vast majority of his clients' portfolio allocations intact, though he did have a few clients who balked. ''It's only during a bear market when people really realize what their risk tolerance is,'' he said. For those people, he reduced their stock allocations -- for good.
 And that's all you need to do, he said.
 ''The old recipe works just fine,'' he said. ''Don't mess with it.''

HEADLINE: Regulator Shopping

 BODY:
The financial crisis had no single cause. But everyone knows that regulatory failure played a role and that one of the biggest mistakes was to allow ''regulatory shopping'' -- in which banks and other financial firms were permitted to choose their own regulator. 
 What resulted was a race to the bottom. Many firms switched at will among various overseers, in search of the loosest rules and laxest regulators. 
 And yet, legislation recently introduced in the House would allow insurance companies, currently regulated by the states, to opt for federal regulation instead -- and, in general, if they don't like that, to switch back after a spell. If the bill were enacted, the race to the regulatory depths would continue, and the nation would be headed in exactly the wrong regulatory direction. 
 The rationale for the proposal -- known as the optional federal charter -- is as meritless as the proposal itself. Supporters of the bill, by Melissa Bean, Democrat of Illinois, and Ed Royce, Republican of California, say the bailout of the American International Group is evidence of the need for the bill. That doesn't compute. 
 The insurance businesses of A.I.G. did not falter during the financial crisis, and remain solvent and functional to this day. There are many problems with state regulation of insurance -- it is inefficient for insurers and inconsistently applied by the states -- but it has done a good job ensuring the safety and solvency of insurance operations, something that can't be said about federal bank regulation. 
 What failed at A.I.G. was its non-insurance business -- specifically, the financial products unit, overseen by the federal Office of Thrift Supervision, arguably the weakest of all the federal bank regulators. A.I.G. was permitted to choose the thrift office as its non-insurance overseer in 1999, after it bought a small savings and loan. 
 Thus, A.I.G.'s bailout is not an indictment of state regulation of insurance. It is a vindication of it, because the insurance businesses weathered the crisis relatively unscathed. Nor is it an argument for a license to choose one's regulator, because regulator-shopping got A.I.G. the overseer least equipped to rein in its risky dealings. 
 The bill's proponents have also said that the federal government has a duty to oversee insurance companies because some have been offered bailout money in the past week. That is evidence, they claim, that insurers can threaten the financial system, necessitating federal oversight. But the Treasury Department said that the decision to grant money to insurers wasn't based on concerns about systemic risk, but rather was intended to boost investor confidence in healthy firms.
 At play here is the power of the insurance industry that has clamored for federal -- weaker -- regulation for nearly a decade. The industry, and its Congressional supporters, are trying to use the current upheaval to advance a predetermined agenda. 
 The effort is disingenuous -- and a shame. Insurance needs to be better regulated, especially with regard to consumer protections, to prevent discriminatory pricing and delays in payments, and to ensure availability and affordability of insurance. The financial crisis may have also revealed areas where a greater federal role is indeed called for, such as in bond insurance, which is not directly related to consumers and yet has a major impact on state and local economies. At best, insurance regulation would be reformed to allow for an interplay of state and federal regulation, such that each reinforces the other. As it is, the bill would pit one against the other. 
 Cooler heads in Congress and the Obama administration should stop the optional federal charter -- and all forms of regulatory shopping -- in their tracks.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Stumbles as Day Nears End

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
Markets fell slightly on Wednesday as early optimism over a $13.5 billion stock offering by Bank of America faded in the afternoon, leading some investors to cash in their gains before the holiday weekend. 
 Financial stocks tugged the markets lower, offsetting gains by materials producers, whose shares rose as the price of crude oil topped $62 a barrel in New York.
 Investors pushed up the price of commodities including gold, soybeans and wheat as the dollar fell against other currencies.
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 52.81 points, or 0.6 percent, to close at 8,422.04. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 4.66 points, or 0.5 percent, ending at 903.47. The Nasdaq composite index was down 6.70, or 0.4 percent, at 1,727.84.
 ''What really happened today was the standard ebb and flow between people thinking the rally is justified because we're not slipping into the dark ages, and fears that we don't have enough earnings growth to sustain the higher levels,'' said David Bianco, chief United States equity strategist at UBS.
 It was the second day of light losses on Wall Street after a sharp climb at the start of the week. Analysts said financial stocks traded heavily all day, adding that the decline in shares of Citigroup, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs was the result of profit-taking, rather than new concerns about the banks.
 But Bank of America rose 2.1 percent to close at $11.49 after saying it had raised $13.5 billion in new capital as it sought to comply with the requirements of the government's ''stress tests.'' Regulators said Bank of America needed to raise $34 billion to withstand further declines in the economy.
 In testimony on Capitol Hill, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said the 19 major banks that had undergone stress tests had raised or announced plans to raise $56 billion in new capital. That brought them closer to the $75 billion that regulators said 10 of those big banks needed to raise.
 Credit card companies were mixed after the House passed new restrictions aimed at protecting cardholders from sudden increases in interest rates. Shares of American Express and Discover Financial fell, while MasterCard and Visa gained ground.
 Companies that make chemicals, plastics and other basic materials rose as investors bet that the rise in crude prices augured growth and higher earnings in the industrial sector.
 ''People believe the global economy, particularly the emerging economies, are on the path to recovery,'' Mr. Bianco said.
 The Treasury's 10-year note rose 14/32, to 99 14/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 3.19 percent, from 3.24 percent late Tuesday.

HEADLINE: After Wars, Mass Rapes Persist

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF. 
Gail Collins is off today.

DATELINE: MONROVIA, Liberia 

 BODY:
 Traditionally, an international issue was ''serious'' only if it was arcane and, preferably, incomprehensible. To be respected in foreign policy, it helped to smoke a pipe, spout theories about ballistic missiles, and frequently employ the word ''hegemony.''
 Now pipes are passe, three of the last four secretaries of state have been women, and a new foreign policy agenda is emerging around issues like poverty, genocide, climate change and a topic that until recently was hushed up -- sexual violence. 
 In modern times, we've seen mass rape as an element of warfare in Congo, Darfur, Bosnia, Rwanda, Liberia -- but the lesson here in Liberia in West Africa is that even when the fighting ends, the rape continues. And that brings us to Jackie, a lovely 7-year-old with tight braids and watchful eyes.
 Jackie is too young to remember the 14-year civil war in Liberia, from 1989 to 2003, when as many as three-fourths of women were raped. Jackie's world is one of a bustling, recovering Liberia with a free press and democratically elected leaders.
 Yet somehow mass rape survived the end of the war; it has been easier to get men to relinquish their guns than their sense of sexual entitlement. So the security guard at Jackie's school, a man in his 50s, took the little girl to the beach where, she said, he stripped her and raped her. Finally, he ran off as she lay bleeding and sobbing on the sand.
 ''I couldn't walk well, so they took me to hospital,'' Jackie told me. It was worse than that: She was hemorrhaging, and the hospital couldn't stop it. So Jackie was rushed in critical condition to Monrovia's largest hospital, where she spent weeks recovering. 
 Jackie is now in a shelter for survivors of sexual violence -- and what staggered me is that so many of the girls are pre-teens. A 3-year-old survivor has just moved out, but Jackie jumps rope with girls aged 8 to 11. 
 Of course, children are raped everywhere, but what is happening in Liberia is different. The war seems to have shattered norms and trained some men to think that when they want sex, they need simply to overpower a girl. Or at school, girls sometimes find that to get good grades, they must have sex with their teachers.
 ''Rape is a scar that the war left behind,'' said Dixon Jlateh, an officer in the national police unit dealing with sexual violence. ''Sexual violence is a direct product of the war.''
 The evidence is overwhelming that the best way to deal with rape -- whether in Darfur or Liberia, or even in the United States -- is to demystify it, dismantle the taboos, and address it directly. That is happening. 
 The United Nations Security Council held a formal session last year on sexual violence, and the International Criminal Court in The Hague issued its arrest warrant for Sudan's president in part because of mass rapes. Senators Barbara Boxer and Russ Feingold chaired subcommittee hearings on rape just this month, focused on Congo and Sudan, where the brutality is particularly appalling. But the lesson of Liberia is equally sad: that even when wars end, mass rape continues by inertia.
 In Liberia, sexual predation during the civil war was ''normal.'' One major survey found that 75 percent of women had been raped -- mostly gang-raped, with many suffering internal injuries.
 The incidence of rape has dropped since then but is still numbingly high. An International Rescue Committee survey in 2007 found that about 12 percent of girls aged 17 and under acknowledged having been sexually abused in some way in the previous 18 months.
 Then there is the age of the victims. Of the 275 new sexual violence cases treated between January and April by Doctors Without Borders in Liberia, 28 percent involve children aged 4 or younger, and 33 percent involve children aged 5 through 12. 
 ''The rape of little children is common,'' said Oretha Brooks, a social worker at the excellent Duport Road Clinic in Monrovia. ''It happens on a daily basis.'' She introduced me to Wynnie, a 9-year-old girl in her waiting room who had been raped twice. 
 Yet there are signs of progress. Liberia's president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the first woman elected a president in Africa, has sent strong signals that rape is intolerable. Aid groups like the Carter Center are working to promote the rule of law and punish the rapists, recognizing that economic development will be elusive as long as women and girls are prey.
 Maybe the greatest reassurance came from Jackie, the resilient 7-year-old. She appeared to have overcome the stigma of rape, for she explained that she wanted to grow up to build shelters for abused girls, adding, ''I want to be president for Liberia.''

HEADLINE: Fed Weighed Purchasing Additional Debt in April

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
Seeking to keep interest rates in check and heal the credit markets, the Federal Reserve last month debated whether it should expand a program to buy mortgage and Treasury securities, according to minutes of the meeting released Wednesday. 
 The Fed also lowered its outlook for this year and 2010, saying that the American economy would contract more sharply and unemployment would rise higher than the central bank originally projected in January. 
 Some economists called the earlier expectations too rosy, considering how quickly businesses were shedding jobs and slashing investments.
 In the April 28-29 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, some members said the purchase of additional Treasury notes ''might well be warranted at some point to spur a more rapid pace of recovery.'' Ultimately, though, the Fed decided to put off buying more Treasuries.
 ''All members concurred with waiting to see how the economy and financial conditions respond to the policy actions already in train before deciding whether to adjust the size or timing of asset purchases,'' said the minutes, which offered a glimpse into the details of the committee's regular closed-door meetings.
 In March, the Fed announced that it would buy $300 billion in longer-term Treasuries, in an effort to keep interest rates low. Immediately afterward, yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury fell sharply to 2.5 percent, from 3 percent. They have climbed back since then as stocks have surged and were as high as 3.34 percent on May 7.
 The Fed reaffirmed its promise to buy $1 trillion of the assets, a move intended to restore lending and encourage recovery.
 ''They didn't really tell us anything complete,'' said Jan Hatzius, chief United States economist at Goldman Sachs. ''They said they're thinking about expanding the programs, but we knew they had to be thinking about that because over the next few months they'll have filled the quota if they continue at this pace.''
 Economists said the Federal Open Market Committee would probably wait until next month to reassess its securities purchases. In the meantime, it will pay attention to interest rates on government debt and signals from the credit markets and the economy.
 The Fed has already bought $118 billion in Treasury securities, according to Barclays Capital. Some economists said the central bank's big asset purchases amount to printing money, and they have warned that the Fed was setting the stage for inflation. But any rebound could be a long way off.
 The Open Market Committee said it now expected the economy to shrink 1.3 percent to 2 percent this year, a sharper drop than its original projections of a contraction of 0.5 to 1.3 percent. And it said unemployment would reach 9.2 to 9.6 percent in 2009, up from its original estimates of 8.5 to 8.8 percent unemployment.
 The unemployment rate has already hit 8.9 percent, and nearly six million jobs have been lost since the recession began. 
 Still, the Fed saw room for some tepid optimism. The committee said that financial markets had ''generally strengthened,'' and that confidence among consumers and businesses was clawing back, though it remained low.

HEADLINE: Warning: Paralysis May Result

BYLINE: By JOYCE WADLER

DATELINE: EUREKA, Calif. 

 BODY:
 HERE we are, squatting in the chocolate-scented mulch of Amy Stewart's poison garden. The smell comes from the cocoa hulls. Good thing you're not a dog; according to Ms. Stewart, the theobromine in the hulls, should you chomp down enough, could lead to vomiting.
 Don't get cocky, though. Ms. Stewart, the author of ''Wicked Plants: The Weed That Killed Lincoln's Mother & Other Botanical Atrocities'' (Algonquin), a new book that inspired the coming ''Wicked Plants'' exhibition at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, has plenty of plants on hand to deal with any human who annoys her. And you know how sensitive authors on the cusp of publication can be.
 Foxglove, opium poppies and castor beans, among a total of about 30 varieties of toxic plants, are thriving outside her house in Northern California. There are singular garden ornaments, too: a miniature tombstone for Socrates next to the hemlock; one reading ''Death By Asphyxiation'' beside the monkshood; another that says ''Kidney Failure'' (that would be for cats) beside the lilies. And don't get her started on the ''Madness'' stone. 
 ''All of my favorite little hallucinogens are here,'' says Ms. Stewart, who is 39 and whose distinctive markings include a head of curly strawberry hair, Birkenstocks and a sunny disposition. She zooms in on a stumpy plant starting to bloom.
 ''This is datura,'' she says. ''In August, this will have white trumpet-shaped flowers. They also call it jimson weed. It can cause hallucinations and, ultimately, it could cause enough cardiac and respiratory distress that it could kill you.''
 Ms. Stewart found it, she says, ''in front of a friend's house in Albuquerque,'' adding: ''She has two little boys, toddlers, so I said: 'You know, you need to get rid of this. It is very, very poisonous.' ''
 An aside, which you can count on the fast-talking Ms. Stewart to supply as certainly as aconite, a plant that paralyzes the nerves, slows the blood pressure and stops the heart: ''People who know nothing about plants are surprisingly unwilling to rip a plant out of the ground.''
 She continues: ''Finally, I'm leaving and I say, 'If you're going to leave the plant in, a few things to keep your eye out for: if their faces get real red; if they get real flushed; if they get dizzy; if their heart stops beating.' '' 
 She does an excellent imitation of the species gardinus ignoramus femininas shrieking for her husbandto get a shovel. ''Then it's, 'Ho-neeeeeee!' '' Ms. Stewart yells. ''She finally got it. Why are they protecting the plant? Same thing with oleander. People say the kids aren't going to eat the plant. It's a shrub. It cost maybe $20.''
 It is bucolic up here in redwood country, if you don't count the seal skull in the poison garden or the human bones (resin reproductions, not to worry) off the side porch. Ms. Stewart and her husband, Scott Brown, who is 42 and runs an antiquarian bookstore, bought the house for a bargain price ($125,000) 11 years ago. It is a pretty little cream-colored Victorian, with tangerine- and cornflower-colored trim, flanked on two sides with lush and casual gardens filled with the sort of plants that are worthless should you find your husband playing around: purple-flowered catmint, reddish-pink Jupiter's beard, yellow-flowered fennel. 
 In the garden out back are three chickens and a small coop with a rather good portrait by Ms. Stewart of Eleanor, a chicken who succumbed to cancer. A few years ago, Ms. Stewart took an oil-painting course. Others were daunted by the wipe-it-off-if-it-doesn't-work, paint-it-again routine. But Ms. Stewart, who has written three well-received books on the plant world, was entirely at ease. (''Revision -- oh, I get that!'')
 A state of ease is not what awaits the reader of ''Wicked Plants,'' chapters of which include ''This Houseplant Could Be Your Last,'' ''Lawn of Death'' and ''Deadly Dinner.'' Browse through it and you will tremble at the sight of a salad. It is, however, a fine gift for owners of country houses who have become altogether too smug about country life. 
 The book makes no pretense of being a comprehensive guide to poisonous plants. While it is instructive, its focus is on great yarns. 
 ''A plant alone in a jungle is kind of boring,'' Ms. Stewart says. ''But when a person comes along and realizes they can kill someone with a plant, now we've got a story. The plants I chose, I needed a good victim. I needed a body count.''
 Ms. Stewart's poison garden was begun three years ago, when she started working on the book. She wanted a writer's garden, so she put in a wooden chair, a desk, the bones of a floor lamp. There are also books, some half buried, others nailed to shelves in such a way that their pages turn in the breeze. Disintegrating, they fit in surprisingly well, returning to the earth as naturally as a cornfield after harvest. ''Autopsy for an Empire,'' with its dried-blood-colored jacket, is planted beside the hellebore, which the Greeks used to poison the water of their enemies. P. D. James's ''Original Sin'' and Stephen King's ''Salem's Lot'' sit on a bookshelf, which is also disintegrating.
 ''These were moldy or torn,'' Ms. Stewart says. ''I'm not destroying books that had any sort of life in them. I just wanted the sense that the book I'm writing is coming out of the ground. If you put a book in the ground, will you get 10 little baby books out of the ground?''
 ''It's very fun to do damage to books,'' she continues, ''to soak them in water, to bury them in the ground. I actually drilled a hole through one with a power drill. It's neat how they fall apart.''
 She must be getting sick of that bookstore.
 ''Oh, no, we've only owned the bookstore for a year and a half, and it's really my husband's deal.''
 Maybe somebody in publishing hurt her?
 ''No, Algonquin said yes to my first book and said yes to all of them.''
 In fact, Ms. Stewart, who grew up in Arlington, Tex., seems to have had a happy life. Her father, Vic Stewart, was a guitarist with Doc Severinsen's road band. Her mother, Dee, wanted to be a newspaper reporter, but took public relations jobs to provide the family with economic stability.
 Ms. Stewart wanted very much to be a writer, but understood the merits of a day job. She got a master's degree in community planning from the University of Texas, Austin, where she met Mr. Brown. They moved to California in 1992 as Vista volunteers and settled in the Bay Area, where Mr. Brown became a dealer in rare books and Ms. Stewart got a job with the Santa Cruz Housing Authority. In 1995, she began writing a gardening column, ''The Ground Up,'' for La Gazette, a free feminist paper. She did not write advice columns. She preferred personal stories, like those about her battles with snails.
 And what was her preferred method of doing battle with snails, she is asked in a quiet moment in her book-lined attic work space.
 ''To throw them out into the street and let them be run over by cars,'' she says. ''It's very satisfying.''
 The writing life has not made Ms. Stewart rich. The ''Wicked Plants'' advance was $25,000; her royalties for the last 12 years have averaged $10,000 a year -- before the agent took her 15 percent.
 Ms. Stewart is fine with that. She and her husband live frugally, sharing a single car, a 1991 Toyota Corolla, so they can do what they want.Which includes, for Ms. Stewart, lecturing at the opening of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden show on May 31.
 That's coming up fast. So a couple of quick questions: Is Ms. Stewart concerned that ''Wicked Plants'' might enable someone to commit a crime?
 ''No, I thought about that,'' she says. ''But here's the thing: this information is widely available on the Internet. Anybody who wants to kill someone with a plant can Google 'murder.' ''
 And say one's husband, or sweetie, was playing around -- what would Ms. Stewart recommend? This is hypothetical, of course.
 ''I would say mala mujer,'' she says, referring to a nettle-like shrub found in the Southwest. ''It's considered a treatment for infidelity. Men would give it to their wives as a tea, to control sexual urges. It might stop them from philandering. Another great one is the nut from the suicide tree. You can grind it up and put it in a pulpy kind of dessert -- they use it in India -- or conceal it in a curry. The symptoms resemble something like a heart attack.''
 Suppose the lady with the problem, like so many busy New York women, does not cook. But she can make coffee. Would it work in coffee?
 ''Enough of it, and your heart will stop in five or six hours.''

HEADLINE: Treasury Department Is Said to Plan Second Bailout for GMAC

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Treasury Department has decided to bail out GMAC, the former financing arm of General Motors, with $7.5 billion, according to people familiar with the discussions, which would bring its total federal assistance to more than $12 billion. 
 The deal is expected to close on Thursday and comes two weeks after federal regulators concluded from a stress test on GMAC that it needed an additional $11.5 billion in capital to weather a severe downturn in the economy. 
 GMAC continues to provide crucial financing for car sales by General Motors, and Treasury officials recognized that its survival was essential to the government's broader attempt to rescue and restructure the automobile giant, according to the individuals who were briefed on the discussions and who spoke only on the condition that they not be identified.
 General Motors and Chrysler are both in the midst of arduous efforts to shrink in size, wring more concessions from labor unions and rethink their fundamental business strategies. 
 GMAC received $5 billion in federal bailout money in December. 
 The company is reeling from the broader credit crisis and the recession, as well as from its losses from subprime mortgages. During the housing boom, GMAC acquired a major subprime lender and became one of the biggest players in that segment of the mortgage industry. 
 The Federal Reserve allowed it to convert to a bank holding company last year, a move that allowed it to apply for rescue help from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP.

HEADLINE: China Grows More Picky About Debt

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG 

 BODY:
Leaders in both Washington and Beijing have been fretting openly about the mutual dependence -- some would say codependence -- created by China's vast holdings of United States bonds. But beyond the talk, the relationship is already changing with surprising speed.
 China is growing more picky about which American debt it is willing to finance, and is changing laws to make it easier for Chinese companies to invest abroad the billions of dollars they take in each year by exporting to America. For its part, the United States is becoming relatively less dependent on Chinese financing. 
 China has actually bought Treasury bonds at an accelerating pace over the last year -- notwithstanding Chinese officials' complaints about American profligacy. But the borrowing needs of the United States government have grown even faster. So China represents a rapidly shrinking share of overall purchases of Treasury securities. ''China's demand for Treasuries has increased over the past year, but it hasn't increased at anything like the pace of the Treasury's sale of new Treasury bonds,'' said Brad W. Setser, a specialist in Chinese financial flows at the Council on Foreign Relations.
 Americans and investors elsewhere are buying Treasuries instead. They are saving more and have been shifting out of other investments -- including equities until the past two months -- and into Treasuries. 
 China bought less than a sixth of the Treasuries issued in the 12 months through March. Less than two years ago, by contrast, Chinese purchases of Treasuries, which included purchases in the secondary market as well as newly issued securities, briefly exceeded the entire borrowing needs of the United States. 
 Financial statistics released by both countries in recent days show that China paradoxically stepped up its lending to the American government over the winter even as it virtually stopped putting fresh money into dollars. 
 This combination is possible because China has been exchanging one dollar-denominated asset for another -- selling the debt of government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in a hurry to buy Treasuries. While this has been clear for months, new data shows that China is also trading long-term Treasuries for short-term notes, highlighting Beijing's concerns that inflation will erode the dollar's value in the long run as America amasses record debt.
 So China's rising purchases of Treasuries do not represent the confident bet on America's future that they might seem to be on the surface. For instance, China does not appear to be dumping euros or yen to buy Treasuries, economists said.
 That said, recent Chinese and American data suggest that an astounding 82 percent of China's $2 trillion in foreign reserves is in dollars, according to calculations by Standard Chartered. 
 The development has caught the attention of the leaders of both countries.
 ''The long-term deficit and debt that we have accumulated is unsustainable -- we can't keep on just borrowing from China,'' President Obama said last Thursday. 
 Wen Jiabao, prime minister of China, also has expressed concern.
 ''We have lent a huge amount of money to the U.S. Of course we are concerned about the safety of our assets. To be honest, I am definitely a little worried,'' Mr. Wen said earlier this year. 
 China now earns more than $50 billion a year in interest from the United States, Mr. Setser at the Council on Foreign Relations calculated.
 China's leaders were able to buy more Treasuries in recent months without buying more dollars because they have abruptly turned their back on the market for securities issued by government-sponsored enterprises.
 China was the world's biggest buyer of these securities a year ago, splashing out more than $10 billion a month.
 But in the 12 months through March, it actually had net sales of $7 billion, and ramped up purchases of Treasuries instead.
 China has also changed which Treasuries it buys. It has done so in ways calculated to reduce its exposure to inflation or other problems in the United States. As recently as a year ago, China actively bought long-dated bonds, seeking the extra yield they could bring compared to Treasury securities with short maturities, of which China bought virtually none.
 But in each month since November, China has been buying more Treasury bills, with a maturity of a year or less, than Treasuries with longer maturities. This gives China the option of cashing out its positions in a hurry, by not rolling over its investments into new Treasury bills as they come due should inflation in the United States start rising and make Treasury securities less attractive.
 The big question now for policy makers and economists alike lies in whether the Chinese government's purchases of American securities will rise or fall in the coming months.
 Two big forces are at work -- but they are pushing Chinese investments in opposite directions and might cancel each other out.
 The first big shift is that Chinese foreign exchange reserves might start growing again, after shrinking early this year.
 A senior Chinese economic policy maker, Xu Lin, expressed concern here on Monday that the reserves might grow faster if speculators started pushing more foreign exchange into China in the months ahead.
 China is strongly opposed to any significant appreciation or depreciation of its currency, Mr. Xu said at a press conference. But if international investors conclude that the Chinese economy has stabilized ahead of economies elsewhere, they may start pumping more money into the Chinese economy, he said.
 To keep its currency at the same level, the Chinese government buys foreign currency flowing into the country in excess of China's needs. If overseas demand for Chinese exports recovers, then China's trade surplus could start widening again as well. This would also tend to fatten Chinese reserves.
 But the countervailing trend is that the Chinese government is trying to foster channels for foreign currency to be pumped out of the country without the involvement of the central bank. The government has been buying a wider range of assets and encouraging the private sector to invest more money overseas.
 ''That's part of a strategic move by the authorities to diversify,'' said Wensheng Peng, the head of China research at Barclays Capital. ''The reserves growth should accelerate because of inflows, but it will not be as large as what we observed in 2007 and the first half of 2008.''
 The State Administration of Foreign Exchange, which is part of the central bank, issued draft regulations on Monday that would make it considerably easier for private companies to raise dollars in China to spend on overseas investments -- a step that would lessen the need for the Chinese government to buy up those dollars.
 This spring China has also been stepping up its purchases of commodities, which are usually bought in dollars. Iron ore has been piling up on Chinese docks, government stockpiles of crude oil and grain are being expanded and stockpiles are being started for products like gasoline, diesel and sugar. 
 After six years of silence, China unexpectedly disclosed last month that it had been gradually buying gold from domestic producers. The country's reserves had climbed from 600 tons in 2003 to 1,054 tons, worth $31.8 billion at prices late Wednesday.
 The disclosure, which produced a frisson of excitement in gold markets, may have been aimed at reassuring a domestic audience that the Chinese government was not putting all the nation's savings into American dollars. But the actual investment was tiny compared with China's foreign exchange reserves -- and showed that China was accumulating gold at a much slower rate than foreign currency.
 A person in periodic contact with China's central bank, who insisted on anonymity to preserve his access, said that a Chinese central banker complained to him last year that ''we have so much money and there's so little gold, we can't buy much without driving up the price.''

HEADLINE: PUSH FOR TALKS IN AFGHAN FIGHT

BYLINE: By DEXTER FILKINS; Taimoor Shah contributed reporting.

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan 

 BODY:
Leaders of the Taliban and other armed groups battling the Afghan government are talking to intermediaries about a potential peace agreement, with initial demands focused on a timetable for a withdrawal of American troops, according to Afghan leaders here and in Pakistan.
 The talks, if not the withdrawal proposals, are being supported by the Afghan government. The Obama administration, which has publicly declared its desire to coax ''moderate'' Taliban fighters away from armed struggle, says it is not involved in the discussions and will not be until the Taliban agree to lay down their arms. But nor is it trying to stop the talks, and Afghan officials believe they have tacit support from the Americans.
 The discussions have so far produced no agreements, since the insurgents appear to be insisting that any deal include an American promise to pull out -- at the very time that the Obama administration is sending more combat troops to help reverse the deteriorating situation on the battlefield. Indeed, with 20,000 additional troops on the way, American commanders seem determined to inflict greater pain on the Taliban first, to push them into negotiations and extract better terms. And most of the initial demands are nonstarters for the Americans in any case. 
 Even so, the talks are significant because they suggest how a political settlement may be able to end the eight-year-old war, and how such negotiations may proceed. They also raise the prospect of potentially difficult decisions by President Hamid Karzai and President Obama, who may have to consider making deals with groups like the Taliban that are anathema to many Americans, and other leaders with brutal and bloody pasts. Some of the leaders in the current talks have been involved with Al Qaeda. 
 While the talks have been under way for months, they have accelerated since Mr. Obama took office and have produced more specific demands, the Afghan intermediaries said. 
 The Taliban leaders, through their spokesman, and those of other armed groups publicly deny that they are involved in any negotiations. But several Afghans here and in Pakistan say they have been talking directly to the Taliban leadership group headed by Mullah Muhammad Omar, the movement's secretive founder. The council is based in the Pakistani city of Quetta.
 Discussions have also been held with representatives of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, a longtime warlord with a record of extreme brutality, and with Sirajuddin Haqqani, whose guerrilla army is based in the tribal areas of Pakistan. Mr. Haqqani's group is also known for its ruthlessness and for sending suicide bombers into Afghanistan.
 ''America cannot win this war, and the Taliban cannot win this war,'' Mullah Abdul Salaam Zaeef, a former Taliban ambassador and one of the intermediaries, said in an interview. ''I have delivered this message to the Taliban.''
 The talks under way now appear to be directed not at individual bands of antigovernment insurgents -- the strategy suggested by President Obama -- but at the leaders of the large movements.
 American officials insist they are not participating in any talks. ''The U.S. would support such efforts only if Taliban are willing to abandon violence and lay down their arms, and accept Afghanistan's democratically elected government,'' said Ian Kelly, a State Department spokesman. Still, two of the principal intermediaries, Mr. Zaeef and Daoud Abedi, said they had held extensive discussions with American officials. 
 A State Department memo described a single meeting with Mr. Abedi, but said it ended abruptly because American officials were not permitted to meet with representatives of Mr. Hekmatyar. There is no independent confirmation of Mr. Zaeef 's claim to have met with Americans.
 Afghan officials said they welcomed the talks. ''The government has kept all channels of communication open,'' said Homayun Hamidzada, a spokesman for Mr. Karzai. ''This includes the Taliban and Hekmatyar.''
 Mr. Abedi, an Afghan-American businessman from California and a member of Mr. Hekmatyar's political party, the Islamic Party, said he conducted negotiations in March. Guerrillas loyal to Mr. Hekmatyar are battling the Americans in the mountains of eastern Afghanistan. His political party still has a wide following in the country. 
 In an interview, Mr. Abedi said he undertook the negotiations -- with Mr. Hekmatyar and with the Taliban leaders -- at the behest of the State Department, a claim that American officials deny. Mr. Abedi said he met several times with American officials in Washington before and after his trip to Pakistan and Afghanistan. He declined to say which American diplomats he met, saying, ''I am a Pashtun, and I swore on my honor that I would not reveal the names of the people I met with, so I cannot.''
 Mr. Abedi said he hammered out a common set of demands between the Taliban and Mr. Hekmatyar's group. The groups agreed to stop fighting if those conditions were met, Mr. Abedi said. The Taliban's demands seem incompatible with much of Mr. Obama's strategy, which is to substantially weaken the Taliban through a combination of military force and economic development. 
 Nor did the deal Mr. Abedi described mention either Osama bin Laden or Ayman al-Zawahri, the two senior Qaeda leaders believed to be hiding in Pakistan under the protection of the Taliban or some other armed group.
 The first demand was an immediate pullback of American and other foreign forces to their bases, followed by a cease-fire and a total withdrawal from the country over the next 18 months. Then the current government would be replaced by a transitional government made up of a range of Afghan leaders, including those of the Taliban and other insurgents. Americans and other foreign soldiers would be replaced with a peacekeeping force drawn from predominantly Muslim nations, with a guarantee from the insurgent groups that they would not attack such a force. Nationwide elections would follow after the Western forces left.
 As for Mr. Hekmatyar, Mr. Abedi said that he maintained a ''direct link'' with him, and that he was authorized to negotiate on his behalf. He did not meet with Afghan government officials.
 After the agreement between the Taliban and the Islamic Party was reached, Mr. Abedi said, the Taliban leaders added more conditions: an end to the drone attacks in Pakistan's tribal areas, and the release of some Taliban prisoners.
 Mr. Abedi said that when he returned to the United States with his proposal, he was greeted with enthusiasm by officials at the State Department. But he said they never called him back.
 Mr. Hekmatyar earned a reputation as an especially brutal commander in the civil war that engulfed the country in the 1990s, in particular for the relentless bombardment of Kabul between 1994 and 1996 that killed an estimated 40,000 civilians during an attempt to capture the capital. 
 In 2002, after Mr. Hekmatyar resisted the American invasion, the Americans tried to kill him with a missile fired from a remotely piloted airplane. They missed.
 The other main negotiation is led by Mr. Zaeef and Arsallah Rahmani, a former Taliban minister and now a member of the Afghan Parliament. 
 ''We are not talking to low-ranking people -- we are talking to the leaders,'' Mr. Rahmani said in an interview. Mr. Zaeef was the Taliban's ambassador to Pakistan; he served nearly four years in American military prisons, including the one at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
 Their plan would be for the guerrillas and the government to reconcile slowly, starting with the least contentious issues. One of the main low-level demands of the opposition leaders is that their names be removed from a so-called blacklist, contained in a resolution passed by the United Nations Security Council, which obliges governments to detain them. More difficult issues would follow.
 ''Blood begets blood, but talking begets peace,'' Mr. Rahmani said.
 Mr. Zaeef said the public declarations of Mullah Omar, who usually vows to fight on, are not necessarily to be taken seriously.
 ''A policy can have many faces,'' he said.

PRESSING COSTCO
 On Food Stamps
 William C. Thompson Jr., the city comptroller and a candidate for mayor, jumped into the Costco food stamp debate on Wednesday as a shareholder representative, pressuring the warehouse chain to accept federal food stamps. 
 Unlike other city officials and community groups that have raised questions about Costco's food stamp policy, Mr. Thompson also has the power of the purse. New York City operates one of the top five pension funds in the country, and as city comptroller he oversees $82 billion in city investment funds. Spread among the holdings are 1.5 million shares of Costco stock, valued at $66 million. 
 As of Wednesday afternoon, Costco's market capitalization was around $21 billion.
 Many other chains -- including Wal-Mart, Whole Foods, B.J.'s, and Trader Joe's -- accept food stamps.
 Mr. Thompson wrote a letter to the chief executive of Costco, James D. Sinegal, casting his request not only in terms of good civic policy, but also in terms of corporate strategy.
 ''This ill-advised resistance clearly establishes a competitive disadvantage and presents a reputational risk for Costco,'' Mr. Thompson wrote.
 In an interview, Mr. Thompson said that, given the economic climate, food stamps had become a crucial part of the safety net. 
 ''That is the direction the whole country is going in right now,'' he said. ''It isn't just poor people who are using food stamps. It is the working poor, and those who have been working for a long time and lost their jobs.''
 Costco is opening a store in East Harlem, at East River Drive and 116th Street, an area that is home to about 30,000 people who use food stamps. In addition, Costco has a store in Queens within walking distance from several housing projects.
 Mr. Thompson wrote that accepting food stamps would not ''only display sensible corporate responsibility, but promote your new facility's opening, and burnish Costco's reputation as a good and dependable neighbor.''
 Costco executives have refused to comment on the issue. Jennifer 8. Lee

HEADLINE: Bank System Is Healing, Geithner Tells Senators

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY and EDMUND L. ANDREWS

 BODY:
The country's biggest banks have made moves to bolster their balance sheets by about $56 billion since the government disclosed the results of its financial ''stress tests'' two weeks ago, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said Wednesday.
 Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee, Mr. Geithner said that the financial system had begun to ''heal,'' and that the Treasury would soon be introducing the next phase of its financial rescue effort -- the plan to team up with private investors to buy billions of dollars in toxic assets from banks. 
 ''There are important indications that our financial system is starting to heal,'' Mr. Geithner told lawmakers, though he cautioned that it was still too early to talk about an ''exit strategy'' for the government. 
 But lawmakers in both parties complained that the $700 billion aid plan, known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, had yet to revive bank lending in many parts of the country.
 ''The frustration level is mounting on an hourly basis,'' said Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and chairman of the banking committee.
 Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama who voted against the entire program last year, said the Treasury had ''treated many sick banks'' but ''certainly has not cured them.''
 Democratic lawmakers said that the Treasury was not being firm enough with aid recipients, and several complained that officials were letting General Motors expand production in China as it closed plants in the United States and received taxpayer money.
 Republican lawmakers asserted that the government was too intrusive. Senator Mike Johanns of Nebraska, who served as agriculture secretary under President George W. Bush, questioned whether administration officials had the legal authority to oust G.M.'s chief executive, Rick Wagoner, who resigned in late March at the administration's request.
 Mr. Geithner said he was ''completely confident that we acted within the legal authority of the executive branch'' in pushing out Mr. Wagoner, but he also made it clear that he did not want to second-guess the company's decisions to invest in China.
 In describing the banking system, Mr. Geithner, said that the country's largest financial institutions had raised billions by issuing common stock and new debt, including $8 billion in bonds not guaranteed by the government.
 After reviewing the condition of 19 of the country's largest financial institutions, regulators said on May 7 that 10 banks needed to raise a total of $75 billion in additional capital to withstand losses if the economy took another turn for the worse. The government said banks could raise the money privately, or convert their preferred shares held by the government to common stock.
 Since then, the banks have raised or announced plans to raise $56 billion -- $48 billion of which came from the 10 banks that needed to bolster their capital levels, Mr. Geithner said. 
 Several banks, including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and State Street, have said that they want to repay the money they received from the government's $700 billion bailout, and are raising money to do so. 
 Bank of America announced Tuesday night that it had raised $13.47 billion through the sale of 1.25 billion shares of stock. The bank's share price was up 2 percent on Wednesday, to $11.49.
 Mr. Geithner reiterated his prediction that banks would repay about $25 billion in government loans in the months ahead. But when Republicans asked whether the Treasury would reduce its involvement as banks repaid their loans, Mr. Geithner responded that the Treasury would still have the ability to recycle the money into new loans to other institutions if it saw fit. In his testimony, Mr. Geithner offered a broad assessment of how the government had been trying to stabilize the financial system, calm the credit markets, keep the automobile industry afloat and revive the flagging economy. 
 He said that lending markets were stabilizing and that the interest rates that businesses pay to raise money from bond buyers had been falling, even for companies with subpar credit ratings. Investors sense less risk in lending markets, and the cost of credit protection for American banks has fallen, he said.
 The government's $1 trillion program to buy troubled assets from banks using public-private partnerships is likely to get rolling within six weeks, he said. The Treasury Department has received more than 100 applications from aspiring fund managers for the program.
 Mr. Geithner also said that less than $100 billion of the $700 billion federal bailout remained. The government has $98.7 billion left and anticipates receiving $25 billion in repayments.

HEADLINE: Tax Proposals Draw Critics in Talks on Financing Health Insurance

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Even as Congress weighed options to finance health insurance for tens of millions of Americans, lobbyists mobilized Wednesday to head off proposed taxes on employer-provided health benefits, alcoholic beverages and soft drinks.
 Labor unions began attacking a proposal by Senators Ron Wyden of Oregon and Max Baucus of Montana, both Democrats, to consider changes in the tax treatment of employer-sponsored insurance, the main source of health coverage for people under 65.
 Radio advertisements, run this week in Portland and Eugene, Ore., at a cost of $60,000, say: ''Senator Ron Wyden would tax the health care benefits we get at work, as if they were income. Taxing health benefits? That doesn't make sense.'' 
 The advertisements were bought by the National Education Association, with help from the United Food and Commercial Workers and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.
 Health insurance and health benefits provided by employers to their employees are not counted as income and are not subject to income or payroll taxes. Mr. Baucus and many economists say the tax break is inequitable because its benefits go disproportionately to people with higher incomes. 
 ''It's too regressive,'' said Mr. Baucus, the committee chairman. ''It just skews the system.''
 Mr. Baucus and Mr. Wyden have suggested that employer-provided health benefits above a certain value could be included in taxable income.
 The proposed tax is among two dozen options considered Wednesday by members of the Senate Finance Committee as they looked for ways to pay for coverage of the uninsured. Almost every option faces opposition from some quarters. 
 Aides to Mr. Baucus admonished lobbyists this week not to criticize the tax options, for fear that such criticism could sink the legislation before it is unveiled.
 The committee is also considering cutting special Medicare payments to teaching hospitals and requiring drug companies to provide bigger discounts to state Medicaid programs. 
 In addition, senior members of the committee, including Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, said they intended to establish stringent new standards for nonprofit hospitals, which could require many of them to provide more charity care and more services to low-income people as a condition of keeping their tax-exempt status.
 The federation of state and local employees denounced Mr. Wyden's idea at a new Web site, stopwydenshealthtax.com, which asserts, ''Under Wyden's plan, we wouldn't be able to keep the health care we have, even if we like it and fought hard to get it.''
 Josh R. Kardon, the chief of staff for Mr. Wyden, said: ''Cadillac health plans should be treated as income, regardless of who is receiving them. The overwhelming majority of American workers should not be asked to subsidize Cadillac health packages through tax breaks, whether it's for a wealthy chief executive or anyone else.''
 Labor unions say their members sacrificed pay raises to get health benefits. Employers and employees assert that the proposed limits on tax-free health benefits would destabilize the current system of insurance provided through the workplace.
 Another proposal would impose a federal excise tax on a variety of soft drinks and other beverages sweetened with sugar or high-fructose corn syrup. Supporters say the tax is justified because the drinks contribute to obesity and drive up medical costs.
 But the American Beverage Association, representing makers of Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Dr Pepper and other soft drinks, urged lawmakers to reject the tax.
 ''We agree with the need for health care reform,'' said Kevin W. Keane, senior vice president of the association. ''We agree with the need to address childhood obesity. But we do not support a soft drink tax.''
 Frank L. Coleman, senior vice president of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, another trade group, said, ''I cannot comment on the deliberations of the Finance Committee.''
 But on its Web site and an affiliated site, stophospitalitytaxes.com the council says taxes on whiskey, gin and vodka are already excessive. 
 Higher taxes would threaten jobs of manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers, including waiters, busboys and bartenders, the council says.
 Michael F. Jacobson, executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer group, said higher taxes on alcoholic beverages and nondiet soft drinks were justified as a way to prevent illness and hold down costs.

HEADLINE: Serbia Welcomes Biden on Balkan Tour

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS KULISH

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia 

 BODY:
Just 15 months after nationalist protesters set the United States Embassy here ablaze, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was greeted Wednesday at the Palace of Serbia by an honor guard in smart blue uniforms, with the band playing ''The Star Spangled Banner.'' 
 It was a surprising but highly representative turn of events, in a country where people are increasingly focused on achieving a degree of normality after decades of strife. 
 Mr. Biden and President Boris Tadic of Serbia spoke together at a news conference about the opportunity for a new, constructive relationship between the United States and Serbia. That same attitude was apparent on the streets of Belgrade, the capital, where many people said they were concerned with ending the isolation and economic stagnation that has left Serbia lagging behind other former Communist countries that have joined the European Union.
 ''Twenty years ago, we were at a much higher level than the Czechs or the Poles -- at the moment we are very, very low,'' said Jasmina Nikolic, 39, who has worked the last nine years all over the world for international cruise companies. Even though her parents and grandparents are from Kosovo, and like the vast majority of Serbs she opposed the decision by Kosovo, a majority-Albanian province, to declare independence from Serbia, she said, ''We've had enough war for our generation.''
 Mr. Biden arrived in Belgrade on the second stop of a three-city tour of the Balkans, intended to show a renewed engagement in the region's politics by the Obama administration. ''Simply put, the region cannot fully succeed without Serbia playing the constructive and leading role -- which you've begun, Mr. President,'' Mr. Biden said to Mr. Tadic at the event.
 But the vice president is hardly viewed as a neutral figure here, having been a staunch supporter of military interventions in the 1990s to help the Muslims in Bosnia and Kosovo. On Wednesday, ultranationalists in Parliament held up signs calling Mr. Biden a Nazi.
 ''He's not welcome,'' Danijela Bjelic said of Mr. Biden, as two of her friends nodded in agreement.
 But their opinion appeared to be a minority view. ''Everyone's welcome in Serbia who has good intentions,'' said Radoslaw Nacic, 61, an electrician. 
 Instead of nationalism, people should focus on ''something to live on, jobs and peace,'' Mr. Nacic said. After the shock of Kosovo's final secession from Serbia in February 2008, nearly a decade after it achieved de facto separation with the help of NATO airstrikes, many analysts feared that Serbia would shift decisively toward the radical camp. But voters here had re-elected the pro-Western Mr. Tadic as president just a few weeks before Kosovo's declaration and they gave his Democratic Party the most seats in Parliament a few months later.
 ''Serbia does not and will never recognize Kosovo,'' Mr. Tadic said Wednesday. But he seemed more focused on the future, calling his talks with Mr. Biden ''very open and productive.'' He also said he thought the discussion ''could set the stage for the formulation of a new American policy towards Serbia and the western Balkans.''
 Jovica Netkovic, 54, was among the Serbs who shared Mr. Tadic's sense of new possibilities. ''The Serbian and American people never really had problems between themselves,'' he said, adding that Mr. Biden's visit to Serbia was ''necessary.'' 
 Mr. Netkovic gestured up at the pulverized facade of the former Yugoslav Defense Ministry building, destroyed during the NATO bombing campaign in 1999. ''I think this is a monument of Serbian stupidity, but also the stupidity of the American administration,'' he said.
 Bosko Jaksic, a columnist at the newspaper Politika and a television commentator, said: ''There are people who are thinking, pay attention to the message and not the messenger. Biden is delivering a completely new message of the Obama administration.'' 
 ''There is a majority who is just not thinking too much,'' Mr. Jaksic said. ''They're more preoccupied by the traffic jam and the semi-occupation of Belgrade,'' he added, referring to the police barricades and road closings for Mr. Biden's visit. That response to public officials creating traffic jams is the very height of normality.

HEADLINE: In California, Democracy Doesn't Pay the Bills

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
Direct democracy has once again upended California -- enough so that the state may finally consider another way by overhauling its Constitution for the first time in 130 years. 
 Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger returned home from a White House visit on Wednesday to find the state dangerously broke, his constituents defiant after a special election on Tuesday and calls for a constitutional convention -- six months ago little more than a wonkish whisper -- a cacophony. 
 As the notion of California as ungovernable grows stronger than ever, Mr. Schwarzenegger, a Republican, has expressed support for a convention to address such things as the state's arcane budget requirements and its process for proliferate ballot initiatives, both of which necessitated Tuesday's statewide vote on budget matters approved months ago by state lawmakers. 
 ''There could not be more of a tipping point,'' said Jim Wunderman, chief executive of the Bay Area Council, a business group that moved forward on Wednesday with plans to push for a constitutional convention. ''We think the interest is going to grow by orders of magnitude now.''
 More immediately, Mr. Schwarzenegger met with legislative leaders to begin the painful process of slashing state spending after voters rejected five ballot measures intended to balance the budget through a mix of tax increases, borrowing and the reallocation of state money.
 The only ballot measure to succeed was one that prevented lawmakers and constitutional officers from getting raises in times of fiscal distress, a sort of chin-out electoral scowl by voters, who will now probably see their health care systems, schools and other services erode. On Friday, the state controller, John Chiang, and the treasurer, Bill Lockyer, are expected to appear before lawmakers and warn them that the state is nearly unable to pay its bills.
 With the special-election results in, the California Citizens Compensation Commission moved Wednesday to impose an 18 percent pay cut for all elected officials, while the Bay Area Council began its campaign to rewrite the Constitution to address some of its more crippling rules and give more financial control to localities. 
 The constitutional effort was immediately embraced by the San Francisco mayor, Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who is a 2010 candidate for governor, and some political experts suggested that the movement might be perfectly timed.
 ''The majority of Californians say the state is headed in the wrong direction,'' said Mark Baldassare, the president of the Public Policy Institute of California, a nonpartisan polling organization. In a March poll of 2,004 residents, two-thirds said the Constitution should be altered, Mr. Baldassare said.
 ''I think that we could be at a crossroads here, '' Mr. Baldassare said. ''People in California don't feel they have the government we need in the 21st century.''
 The last time California held a constitutional convention was in 1878-79 when the state's founding constitution was rewritten, though a state commission made revisions to the document in the 1960s and 1970s. Such a convention would have to be done, of course, through a ballot initiative.
 In the meantime, the unpleasant exercise of renegotiating the state budget -- the third time this fiscal year -- must be done by June 30 in order to realize the full value of any cuts. 
 Facing a $21.3 billion budget deficit, Mr. Schwarzenegger is requesting a $6 billion loan from the federal government, and has proposed a variety of politically unpalatable cuts, including commuting prisoners' sentences, taking away health insurance from some poor children, reducing aid to community colleges and eliminating a large chunk of financing for shelters that serve children and women who have been abused.
 The Legislature, controlled by Democrats, will hold public hearings on the governor's proposals next week and come up with its own suggestions, which would probably affect fewer vulnerable residents and avoid jeopardizing the loss of federal education and health care money that requires a state match.
 While California has suffered the same fate as much of the nation -- high unemployment, large numbers of foreclosures, general economic sluggishness -- its budget woes are greatly exacerbated by its odd and in many ways outmoded way of doing business.
 The ballot initiative process -- in which legislators or independent groups ask voters to mandate how the state's money is spent or not spent -- has become at times an exercise in fiscal self defeat, with voters moving to earmark money for one special program one year, only to contemplate undoing their own will a few elections later.
 The state's legislative districts are highly gerrymandered, leaving the Legislature influenced by the political fringe of both parties and unable to agree on practical budget matters or much else. State senators represent roughly a million people each, larger than most Congressional districts, leaving them out of touch with local needs. Further, the state is one of only three requiring a two-thirds majority vote in the Legislature on taxes and budgets, which leads to partisan fighting and long delays. 
 All of this came into play in the special election on Tuesday.
 ''There was a both-sides-against-the-middle aspect,'' said Bruce Cain, a political scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, ''reflecting the wide differences between Democrats and Republicans on the budget; a general disgust with the Legislature and the governor; ballot fatigue; and weariness with voting for yet another budgetary patch.''
 California passed a budget in February contingent on the ballot measures' winning approval. Even before Tuesday's vote, the state was $5.8 billion newly in the hole because revenues had continued to plummet over the spring. Institutions that rely on state money have already begun to adjust in ways large and small.
 The Los Angeles Superior Court will now close once a month. Dental care at Feather River Hospital in Paradise, near Sacramento, will cease on July 1. The Santa Clarita fireworks show this Fourth of July will be 10 minutes shorter.
 ''The state funds 94 domestic violence emergency shelter programs,'' said Nicole Shellcroft, a former director of a targeted shelter in the Antelope Valley. ''With this cut, the majority of them disappear.''
 When he took office six years ago, Mr. Schwarzenegger promised to bring badly needed systemic change to state government. Though he has not delivered on that promise, he has laid more groundwork for it than his predecessors. He persuaded voters to let an independent panel redraw the legislative districts, which may well erode the partisan chokehold many candidates have had on parts of the state.
 Also, if his ballot proposal to conduct open primaries in the state prevails at the polls next year, political change in Sacramento could be profound.

HEADLINE: Paterson Warns More Cuts May Be Needed This Year

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
Gov. David A. Paterson said on Wednesday that he and the Legislature could be forced to cut as much as $3 billion in spending from the state budget during the next six months if the economy did not begin to recover by the end of the year. 
 Mr. Paterson's remarks came a day after the state comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli, reported that the government had collected nearly a quarter of a billion dollars less in revenue in April than the governor's Division of the Budget predicted it would three weeks ago. With state spending also lower than expected, the state's balance sheet was short by $61 million. 
 ''I am planning for the possibility, which I think is a probability,'' Mr. Paterson said. ''I'm just trying to think ahead and start preparing the Legislature and everyone else that seems to continue at times not to recognize the difficult financial situation that we face.''
 The $3 billion does not reflect a formal revision of the revenue estimate for the current fiscal year, which began on April 1. Rather, it is the same amount that lawmakers were forced to cut in February, during the previous fiscal year, after the stalled economy cut sharply into tax receipts. 
 Mr. Paterson said he considered those earlier cuts a benchmark he and the Legislature could face during the current fiscal year if the economy did not improve. 
 ''We are going to have to look at further cuts. And it is a disturbing kind of announcement to have to make, but it is actually true,'' the governor said.
 Budget officials' current projections assume that the recession would end during the third quarter of this year, with a modest recovery thereafter. A clearer picture of the state's fiscal future will emerge after June 15, the day individuals and business are required to submit their first quarterly tax payments for 2009.
 ''I think the governor's concern is that there is still a lot of risk, and if there isn't a turnaround, that could lead to some risk going forward,'' said Laura L. Anglin, the state budget director. ''It was a statement of caution.''
 The governor's remarks were made during a news conference with Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker, and Malcolm A. Smith, the Senate majority leader, to announce the passage of legislation to extend unemployment benefits for more than 120,000 New Yorkers, including 56,000 whose benefits would have expired next week. The legislation revises New York's unemployment laws to allow the state to tap into $645 million in federal stimulus money for extending unemployment insurance.
 The budget negotiated between Mr. Paterson and state lawmakers this year was brought into balance by substantial slowdowns in spending, billions of dollars in federal stimulus money and billions of dollars in new and higher taxes and fees, some of which have not yet kicked in. Republicans and a few Democrats have criticized Mr. Paterson, Mr. Smith and Mr. Silver -- all Democrats -- for not cutting more at the time.
 ''New York doesn't have a revenue problem; it has a spending problem,'' Dean G. Skelos, the Senate minority leader, said on Wednesday. ''Senate Republicans passed spending cap legislation two times with bipartisan support last year.'' 
 Lawmakers are seeking to restore some programs that were cut during the spring budget negotiations, like a property tax rebate important to suburban homeowners. Mr. Paterson said on Wednesday that any such proposals would have to be paid for with some new source of revenue.
 Such cuts, however, will be even harder to achieve in the coming months than in the spring, since the 2010 elections are approaching and lawmakers are wary of inflicting pain on their constituents.
 Mr. Silver, who resisted some of the cuts that Mr. Paterson sought earlier this year, said on Wednesday that it was too early to begin looking for more trims.
 ''The jury's still out on this year's budget,'' Mr. Silver said.

HEADLINE: A Quiet Meeting of America's Very Richest

BYLINE: By A. G. SULZBERGER

 BODY:
There are fewer billionaires in these tough economic times, so one might imagine that the remaining ones would attract more attention when they moved en masse. Yet when some of America's most prominent capitalists met earlier this month at Rockefeller University, it took weeks before anyone noticed.
 The secrecy continued even after IrishCentral.com, a Web site focused on Irish-American news, wrote on Monday about the May 5 gathering, reporting that the group discussed charitable giving. 
 Participants steadfastly refused to reveal details about the meeting, citing an agreement to protect the confidentiality of the discussion. 
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who was there, revealed little in a brusque response to a question on Wednesday afternoon. ''Anytime I have a meeting that's not on the public schedule, it's not going to be on the public schedule,'' he said. 
 Spokesmen for the other participants declined to comment.
 The silence fed the conspiracy theories that so often emerge when powerful people meet behind closed doors, particularly when the invitation list seems pulled from the Forbes rankings of the world's wealthiest people. 
 The group included Bill Gates (1); Warren E. Buffett (2); Mayor Bloomberg (17); George Soros (29); the real estate developer Eli Broad (93) and his wife, Edythe; Oprah Winfrey (234); David Rockefeller Sr. (305) and his son David Rockefeller Jr.; Ted Turner (376); Peter G. Peterson (430), co-founder of the Blackstone Group, the private equity firm; Julian H. Robertson Jr. (559), who ran a prominent hedge fund; and John P. Morgridge (647), former chairman of Cisco Systems, and his wife, Tashia. 
 Based on February estimates by Forbes, the room had a net worth of about $120 billion, or nearly as much as New York State's annual budget. 
 The participants have reputations as outsize philanthropists, and many have teamed up on causes. Mr. Buffet, for example, recently pledged to donate the bulk of his fortune, currently estimated at $37 billion, to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Together, the men and women at the meeting had donated more than $72.5 billion to charitable causes since 1996, according to an estimate by The Chronicle of Philanthropy. 
 On Wednesday afternoon, the silence was finally broken when one of the participants, Patricia Q. Stonesifer, former chief executive of the Gates Foundation and current chairwoman of the Smithsonian Institution, said the others had been concerned about privacy, not secrecy.
 ''Various members of the group have been talking about philanthropy,'' she said. ''This is a time when the needs are great. So it seemed like a really good time to get together.''
 The event was jointly conceived by Mr. Buffett, Mr. Gates and the elder Mr. Rockefeller, Ms. Stonesifer said. ''This was the first time this particular group had come together and shared a table,'' she said, but added that with their charitable activities and general prominence, ''the degrees of separation were few.''
 The gathering started at 3 p.m. on May 5 and lasted through dinner, and was held at the Rockefeller University president's residence on the Upper East Side campus, said Joseph Bonner, a university spokesman. The president, Paul Nurse, was out of town; the university became involved when the elder Mr. Rockefeller, its former chairman, asked that it provide space for the meeting, Mr. Bonner said. 
 The discussions centered on charitable giving, and participants talked about their personal causes, told of lessons they had learned, and suggested ways to improve and increase philanthropic efforts, Ms. Stonesifer said. 
 ''There wasn't a set agenda. It was a discussion,'' Ms. Stonesifer said. ''The areas of discussion were as varied as the individuals there and their interests.'' 
 No specific plans came out of the meeting, nor were plans made to meet again, Ms. Stonesifer said, adding, ''They really all wanted to continue that dialogue.''

HEADLINE: Bill Changing Credit Card Rules Is Sent to Obama With Gun Measure Included

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Congress on Wednesday sent President Obama a set of new rules governing credit card companies, completing a trio of consumer-related measures that Democrats had raced to get signed into law by Memorial Day.
 But the credit card victory came at a cost that angered some backers of the legislation: approval of an unrelated provision allowing visitors to national parks and wildlife refuges to carry loaded weapons if they are otherwise licensed to possess guns.
 Congressional leaders and administration officials decided not to contest the gun measure propelled by Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, to avoid delaying credit card legislation that the White House wanted as an important symbol of the administration's push for economic relief for consumers. 
 Final House passage of the credit card bill by a margin of 361 to 64 followed Congressional approval earlier this week of an increase in federal resources to pursue financial fraud and another measure that would make it easier for financially pressed homeowners to seek changes in their mortgages. Mr. Obama signed those bills on Wednesday and was planning to act quickly on the credit legislation. 
 ''These are important reforms to protect consumers and to bring some common sense, rationality into our financial system,'' Robert Gibbs, the White House spokesman, said Wednesday.
 At the same time, the Senate on Wednesday approved a measure to overhaul Pentagon contracting and the House is set to do so Thursday, setting up another bill signing on an initiative sought by Mr. Obama. 
 A top White House official said completion of the consumer bills would allow the Obama administration and Congress to concentrate on health care, energy and spending issues in the critical summer months. 
 ''We have taken care of these major initiatives to leave running room to accomplish the big stuff,'' said Rahm Emanuel, White House chief of staff.
 Because of the influence of the financial industry, Congress had made little progress in past efforts to change the regulation of credit card companies, and the prospects remained uncertain earlier this year. But Congress was spurred into action by public outcry over such practices as sudden increases in interest rates even for those who paid their bills, hard-to-understand contract terms and hidden fees. The complaints led Democrats and Republicans to strike a crucial Senate deal on the bill.
 ''This cements a victory for every American consumer who has ever suffered at the hands of the credit card industry,'' Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and the author of the Senate measure, said after the House vote.
 Under the measure, which would take effect in nine months, banks and card companies would be required to give 45 days' notice before a change in interest rates. Companies would be prohibited from raising rates on existing balances unless a card holder fell 60 days behind on minimum payments. 
 The bill makes it much harder to issue credit cards to students and prevents companies from charging a fee to those who exceed their credit limit unless the customer elects to pay the fee in exchange for being allowed to charge more. 
 The measure won support from 248 Democrats and 113 Republicans; 63 Republicans and one Democrat opposed it.
 In arguing against the measure, leading Republicans warned that it could dry up credit, lead card companies to restore annual fees and cause other unintended consequences. They said Congress should give similar new rules proposed by the Federal Reserve a chance to work. 
 ''While perhaps well intentioned, this bill will make credit less available to hard-working families, small businesses, and consumers who are already struggling,'' said Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the No. 2 House Republican.
 Other critics have suggested that the measure does not go far enough and argued for a limit on the interest rates that companies can legally charge, a proposal that lost badly in a Senate vote.
 But leading consumer groups praised the measure, with Pamela Banks, senior policy counsel for Consumers Union, calling it a ''win for everyone who's ever been abused by the tricks and traps of the credit card industry.'' 
 The addition of the gun provision caused the House to split its vote to allow Democrats who backed the credit card elements to oppose the elimination of a ban on loaded weapons in national parks and preserves. The gun amendment was approved 279 to 147, with 174 Republicans and 105 Democrats backing it; 145 Democrats and 2 Republicans opposed it.
 Supporters of the legislation say it was needed to end confusion about where gun owners could carry their weapons and noted that guns are allowed on public lands overseen by the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management. They said it would allow campers and other visitors to the parks to protect themselves better. Currently, firearms must be unloaded and secured in parks and wildlife refuges.
 ''The real winners in this amendment are law-abiding Americans who will not be treated as criminals even though they are good people,'' Representative Rob Bishop, Republican of Utah, said. 
 Many Democrats expressed outrage at how the gun measure had been enacted. 
 ''I am incredibly disappointed that this well-meaning bill has been hijacked and used as a political tool ramming a provision down the throats of Americans,'' said Representative Carolyn McCarthy, Democrat of New York and a leading Congressional supporter of gun control.

HEADLINE: Wells Fargo Said to Be Squeezing Clothier Hartmarx, Raising Liquidation Fears

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
The board of Hartmarx, the Illinois-based men's clothier that is in bankruptcy protection, faced a surprise obstacle to its plan to designate a London-based investment firm as its preferred buyer. 
 The investment firm, Emerisque, would take Hartmarx out of bankruptcy, with the promise of keeping the American company operating.
 But officials close to the bankruptcy negotiations said Thursday that executives from Wells Fargo, Hartmarx's main creditor and the provider of its operating funds while it is in bankruptcy, threatened to cut off future credit, perhaps preventing Hartmarx from making payroll, if its board chose Emerisque. 
 The threat increased fears that the bank favored liquidation.
 Neither Wells Fargo nor the bankruptcy judge overseeing Hartmarx would be under any legal obligation to follow the wishes of the bankrupt company's board, but Wells Fargo has faced increasing pressure to let the company be sold to a buyer likely to keep it operating rather than liquidate it.
 Officials said Hartmarx's board was planning to choose Emerisque early Thursday, but the threat from Wells Fargo delayed that decision, pushing the board's deliberations into the night. 
 Emerisque had gone public with its bid on Wednesday, which it said was final and would expire on Thursday. 
 Fearing that Wells Fargo was pushing to liquidate Hartmarx, a 122-year-old company known for its Hart Schaffner Marx and Hickey Freeman men's wear, 43 members of Congress wrote Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner on Thursday, urging him to press Wells Fargo to help preserve Hartmarx and its more than 3,000 jobs.
 The lawmakers wrote that given that taxpayers had provided Wells Fargo with $25 billion in bailout funds, ''we find it incomprehensible that it would continue to push for the loss of jobs in a viable company.'' 
 The members of Congress added, ''The case of Hartmarx must not become an unfortunate example of financial institutions failing to provide the credit envisioned by Congress to help maintain corporate operations and preserve jobs in this trying economic climate.''
 Officials involved in the negotiations, who did not want to be named discussing delicate details, said Emerisque's bid was worth more than $100 million. Hartmarx owed Wells Fargo and other creditors $114 million when it filed for bankruptcy protection in January. 
 Emerisque has developed a reputation for rescuing apparel brands, among them Lee Cooper, Puma and Ben Sherman.
 Susan Stanley, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, said the bank had no comment.
 Homi Patel, Hartmarx's chief executive, was in meetings Thursday and declined to comment. He has made clear that he favors a bidder that will keep the company operating and preserve its jobs.
 Hartmarx's luster has grown recently because the tuxedo and topcoat that President Obama wore on Inauguration Day were made at the Hart Schaffner Marx plant in Des Plaines, Ill., a suburb of Chicago.
 Last week, Wells Fargo said it favored keeping Hartmarx operating, but indicated it was reluctant to lend more money, considering that Hartmarx had failed to fulfill some of the obligations it made since filing for bankruptcy. 
 Bruce Raynor, the president of Unite Here, the union that represented Hartmarx's workers, said it would be unwise for Wells Fargo to favor liquidation over selling to Emerisque.
 ''The surest route for the bank to recover its money is to make a deal with a well-respected private equity firm that owns and runs several successful brands,'' Mr. Raynor said. ''Emerisque is not only offering substantial recovery for the bank, but to protect the jobs of workers.'' 
 Emerisque issued a statement late Wednesday saying, ''We believe in the potential and future growth of the Hartmarx family of brands, and recognize the value of a 'Made in America' label in the United States and in markets around the world.'' 
 Emerisque added that it wanted to acquire ''substantially all of the assets'' of Hartmarx and run it as a ''single going concern.''
 Under bankruptcy law, the Hartmarx board is authorized to choose a potential buyer. Wells Fargo and other creditors then have 10 days to urge the bankruptcy judge whether to approve or reject that buyer. 
 The Hartmarx rescue has grown into a major issue in Illinois and New York, where Hickey Freeman has a factory in Rochester with 800 workers. Representative Louise M. Slaughter, Democrat of New York, said, ''This Congress helped our financial institutions in order to protect American jobs, and we intend to ensure that these financial institutions do not turn their backs on Hickey Freeman and its employees.''
 Organized labor has threatened to turn up the heat against Wells Fargo if it makes further moves toward liquidation.

HEADLINE: Long-Term Job Claims Rise, But Layoff Rate Edges Down

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Several economic reports released on Thursday suggested the worst of the downturn might be over, but jobless filing claims provided little indication that the employment picture was improving. 
 The number of newly laid-off workers requesting unemployment insurance dropped slightly last week after spiking in previous weeks because of auto layoffs, while continuing jobless claims inched closer to seven million. 
 The Labor Department said Thursday that initial claims for jobless benefits fell to a seasonally adjusted 631,000, down from a revised figure of 643,000 the previous week, but above analysts' expectations of 630,000.
 Claims jumped two weeks ago as Chrysler shut its factories after filing for bankruptcy protection April 30, putting up to 27,000 hourly employees out of work. Wall Street economists expect factory shutdowns by Chrysler and General Motors to inflate the initial claims numbers through June.
 The number of people continuing to claim unemployment insurance rose to nearly 6.7 million from about 6.6 million, the department said, also close to analysts' expectations. That was the highest total on records dating to 1967 and the 16th consecutive record.
 The data reinforced the notion that while the overall economy may start to pick up later this year, the labor market will probably remain weak into 2010 and beyond.
 As a proportion of the work force, the total jobless benefit rolls are the highest since December 1982, when the economy was emerging from a severe recession. The numbers indicate that laid-off workers are having a difficult time finding jobs.
 The four-week average of new claims, which smoothes fluctuations, dipped to 628,500, from 632,000, the department said.
 Among the states, Michigan had the largest increase in claims for the week ended May 9. Claims there rose by 16,817, which it attributed to layoffs in the auto industry. California reported the largest decrease in claims, 10,052, as service industries hired more workers. 
 In a second report, the Conference Board, a private research group, said that its forecast of economic activity rose more than expected in April, the first gain in seven months. The board's index of leading economic indicators, intended to forecast economic activity in the next three to six months, rose 1 percent last month. Economists surveyed by Thomson Reuters expected a 0.8 percent increase.
 The economist at the Conference Board, Ken Goldstein, said the declines in activity could switch to growth in the overall economy in the second half of the year.
 The index is derived from 10 components including stock prices, the money supply, jobless claims and new orders by manufacturers.
 The Conference Board said strengths among the components exceeded weaknesses for the first time in more than a year.
 In another report, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve said that manufacturing in the region contracted in May at the slowest pace in eight months.

HEADLINE: Executive Drafted to Run A.I.G. Will Step Down

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
Edward M. Liddy, the retired insurance executive drafted by the government to lead the American International Group after it nearly collapsed last fall, is stepping down after eight grueling months with virtually no pay.
 Mr. Liddy took on the job of chairman and chief executive of the insurer as a form of public service, but he ended up being castigated by members of Congress who seemed unable to separate him from the financial turmoil he was brought in to calm. 
 Even he said on Thursday that the job was too big and complex as currently designed, and that the company and its government backers would not find anyone else who could take it on for a salary of $1 a year, as he had. 
 ''This is going to be much more of a classic succession process,'' Mr. Liddy said. He recalled that before he ''parachuted in'' last September on a day's notice, A.I.G.'s previous three chief executives had all been forced out, each leaving a wider array of accounting and financial problems in his wake. 
 He said he had begun discussing his own departure with A.I.G.'s board a number of months ago, and had agreed to stay until the company arrived at what he called ''a logical inflection point,'' with stable liquidity and no potential threat to the global financial system. A.I.G. was now at that point, he said, acknowledging that it still had several years' worth of problems ahead. He said he would continue at the helm until a search firm found a successor.
 ''This isn't exactly what I thought I'd be doing in retirement,'' he said Thursday in an interview.
 Separately, lawyers representing A.I.G.'s insurance policyholders sued A.I.G. on Thursday in California Superior Court. The suit also named its executives, including Mr. Liddy, and its outside auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers. The lawsuit accused A.I.G. of improperly diverting money from its insurance units, exposing policyholders to the risk that their claims might never be paid. 
 Linda M. Harris, a financial planner and one of the plaintiffs, said she had put her clients into millions of dollars' worth of life insurance policies and other contracts that she feared A.I.G. might not honor. She said she was an A.I.G. policyholder herself.
 The complaint asserted that in many cases, she and her clients could not get out of these contracts without losing some or all of their investments.
 State insurance regulators are supposed to prevent holding companies from stripping necessary capital out of insurance subsidiaries. But Ms. Harris and her lawyers said in the suit that they believed A.I.G. had pledged the insurance subsidiaries' money to pay back the Federal Reserve, as part of the most recent restructuring of A.I.G.'s federal bailout. 
 One provision of the latest agreement calls for A.I.G. to turn the future cash flows of its American insurance businesses into a security, which would be used to pay back roughly $9 billion of its rescue package from the Fed.
 A spokeswoman for A.I.G., Christina Pretto, said the insurer had not had a chance to review the suit and could not comment. The lawsuit is just the latest in a string of painful and debilitating disputes that have pitted A.I.G. against shareholders, former executives, federal and state prosecutors, members of Congress, unions and regulators. 
 In March, for instance, A.I.G. was roundly criticized for paying retention bonuses to people in its financial products unit -- the division that sold the notorious credit-default swaps at the heart of A.I.G.'s near collapse. Even though the bonuses were granted before his tenure, angry members of Congress grilled Mr. Liddy for paying them, which they saw as an abuse of taxpayer money. Afterward, the recipients of the bonuses complained bitterly that Mr. Liddy had not backed them up. Some resigned.
 ''There are a lot of cooks in the kitchen,'' Mr. Liddy said Thursday, when asked if he thought his position at A.I.G. required him to deal with conflicting demands that were impossible to meet. 
 He said the job entailed answering to the board, the Fed, the Treasury, Congress and 450 regulatory bodies in 130 countries. 
 ''It doesn't make sense to have one person do it,'' he added. 
 He has recommended that A.I.G. separate the chairman and chief executive jobs into separate positions. That would let the chairman concentrate full time on the governance of A.I.G. and the companies it will be spinning off. The chairman would also be responsible for ''walking the halls of Congress'' and keeping government officials informed of A.I.G.'s activities, which could avert surprises and scandals. That would free the chief executive to oversee A.I.G. operations.
 Mr. Liddy said that in the months immediately after the rescue it was hard to sell A.I.G.'s operating units because the economy had slowed so much. He said that now the markets seemed to be recovering and the plan could move forward more smoothly. 
 But even so, he predicted it would take ''three-plus years'' for the restructuring of A.I.G. to be completed and bailout money to be repaid. 
 ''At 63 and one-half years of age, I don't want to be doing this when I'm 67,'' he said. 
 The company also said Thursday that three of its nine directors had decided not to stand for re-election at the company's annual meeting in June. They are Stephen F. Bollenbach, a former chairman and chief executive of Hilton Hotels; Martin S. Feldstein, a Harvard economics professor; and James F. Orr III, chairman of the Rockefeller Foundation. This month, A.I.G. named six new directors, expanding its board.

LENGTH: 1249 words

HEADLINE: 'Tis Pity She's a Brand

BYLINE: By A. O. SCOTT

 BODY:
Steven Soderbergh shot ''The Girlfriend Experience'' over a few weeks last fall, with a relatively low budget, a portable high-definition video camera and a mostly nonprofessional cast. The film's means are modest, not unlike the guerrilla techniques Mr. Soderbergh used in ''Che,'' but nonetheless ''The Girlfriend Experience'' has a sleek, tailored look appropriate to its setting, which is the moneyed precincts of Manhattan at the height -- and most likely the end -- of the recent gilded age. Every frame swims with signs of dearly bought, casually enjoyed luxury as the camera makes its way from high-end boutiques to jewelbox hotels, exclusive restaurants and the cabin of a private plane. 
 Chelsea (Sasha Grey), the main character -- more case study than heroine -- is not only a consumer of top-of-the line merchandise, keeping a careful ledger of the clothes and accessories she has purchased and worn. She is also a commodity in this rarefied market, a prostitute whose specialty is alluded to in the title of the movie. She offers her rich clients more than sex with an obliging, pretty young woman. Sometimes there is no sex at all, as when one of them is especially anxious about the collapsing financial system. What she sells instead, or in addition, is a simulation of intimacy.
 The first scenes, of Chelsea in the company of a handsome, well-mannered customer, are presented as a kind of optical illusion. For all we know, these two attractive people chatting unhurriedly over dinner, then kissing and sipping wine on the couch before making their way to bed, are lovers of long standing and deep attachment. Only when cash changes hands in the morning do we perceive the transactional nature of the affair.
 Up to now Ms. Grey's screen performances have been almost entirely in hard-core pornography, and this professional background, along with her character's profession, adds an aura of titillation to the movie. But ''The Girlfriend Experience'' is less interested in sex than in money, which is shown to be a far more powerful and dangerous source of obsession, confusion, passion and calculation. The movie follows Chelsea from one encounter to the next, and most of those that are not on the clock might be characterized as business meetings and strategy sessions. 
 She chats with an accountant and also with a curious journalist (played by the New York magazine writer Mark Jacobson), and pays a visit to a creepy sex geek whose Web site rates the services of New York's escorts and who styles himself the Erotic Connoisseur. (He is played by Glenn Kenny, a film critic and entertainment writer -- and thus a cordial screening-room acquaintance of mine -- with a combination of grandiose self-regard and theatrical self-disgust that recalls Orson Welles in his Paul Masson wine commercials.) What Chelsea reveals, as she tries to refine her marketing strategies and improve her brand, is not that everyone is a whore -- equating capitalism with prostitution would be an easy, moralizing route for the film to take -- but rather that everyone is hustling, trying to get a bit of leverage in a tough economic climate.
 Chelsea, which might not be her real name, has a live-in boyfriend named Chris (Chris Santos), who works as a personal trainer, tending to the bodies of some of the same kinds of guys who hire Chelsea for her services. The similarities between them are established a little too pointedly, but they are nonetheless thought provoking. Both Chris and Chelsea belong to a sector of the economy that depends on the blurring of certain distinctions, between service and friendship, say, or profit and affection. Therapists, exercise instructors, nannies, manicurists, bartenders -- when you think about it, they are all paid for something that can easily be mistaken for love.
 ''The Girlfriend Experience'' traces this potential category mistake in both directions. One john, as he and Chelsea strip down, rhapsodizes about the communication between them, which of course is the basis for any successful relationship. (''Yeah, totally,'' she says, slipping between the sheets.) But Chelsea, who experiences a twinge of romantic jealousy -- disguised, perhaps, as professional rivalry -- when she sees a once-loyal client on the town with another escort, is not immune to such feelings and finds herself drawn to a sympathetic new customer in ways that throw her off balance. 
 This upsets Chris, and it also puts a crack in the movie's smooth veneer of cynical indifference. The idea that Chelsea, the girlfriend for sale, is herself succumbing to the false allure of the girlfriend experience, is an interesting one, but neither the script, by Brian Koppelman and David Levien (who also wrote ''Ocean's Thirteen''), nor Ms. Grey's cool, tentative acting can quite sustain the level of emotional complication necessary to bring it to dramatic life. Mr. Soderbergh's fractured chronology and chilly, observant style don't help matters. The film, having mystified Chelsea's poise and made much of her gift for persuasive artifice, cannot manage the complication of her vulnerability or chart the terrain of her inner life.
 And this may be the point, at least in part. ''The Girlfriend Experience'' is about, and also traffics in, the intoxification of surfaces, and to say it objectifies Ms. Grey, who is very young (just 21) and very pretty, would be more plot summary than critique. Ms. Grey, whose career in pornography has been distinguished both by the extremity of what she is willing to do and an unusual degree of intellectual seriousness about doing it, is not so much acting here as posing a series of philosophical problems, testing the conceptual and experiential boundaries between degradation and empowerment, predator and prey, person and commodity.
 The problem is that these questions are more provocative than what the movie does with them. It is by turns tryingly obvious and irritatingly oblique. But I suspect that ''The Girlfriend Experience,'' which has been available on video on demand for the past month, may look different a few years from now. 
 Mr. Soderbergh, like Jean-Luc Godard in the second half of the 1960s, is less concerned here with finish or coherence than with an authentic, on-the-fly recording of a moment, and right now that moment -- the weeks just before the last presidential election, when the financial system was in midcalamity -- is at once too close and too emphatically in the past for it to make a lot of sense. But when the turmoil of the last 12 months has receded and the 10th-anniversary deluxe collectors edition comes around, this strange, numb cinematic experience may seem fresh, shocking and poignant rather than merely and depressingly true.

HEADLINE: Greater Say On Boards Holds Risks

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics in his blog at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
The Securities and Exchange Commission is worried about shareholder democracy.
 Again. 
 The commission is asking for comment on proposed rules that would make it easier for institutional shareholders to propose board candidates to be listed on the proxies that every public company sends to its shareholders. 
 If a rule is adopted -- and it looks as if Mary L. Schapiro, the chairwoman, and her two Democratic colleagues are determined to make changes before next spring's proxy season -- then shareholders will get something they have never seen before: ballots with more candidates than jobs to be filled. 
 This is an issue that has been around for decades, and that may have cost one of Ms. Schapiro's predecessors his job. Corporate managements hate the idea, but some institutional investors, including public pension funds, love it, claiming they will be able to improve corporate governance. Companies warn the rule will lead qualified director candidates to refuse to serve rather than face the possibility of rejection by the shareholders.
 While Washington has debated the idea off and on since at least 1977, the world has changed. On the one hand, the need for such a rule has ebbed as markets and technologies made it a lot easier and cheaper for dissatisfied investors to try to replace individual directors or whole boards by running traditional proxy fights.
 On the other hand, the expansion of derivatives markets has made it easy to separate a share's vote from the economic interest that used to be a fundamental part of owning a share. There have been shareholder votes dominated by ''owners'' whose own financial interests ran counter to those of shareholders. Now there are worries that bondholders, whose votes can be critical in bankruptcy reorganizations, may want a company to fail so they can collect on their much larger positions in credit-default swaps.
 In retrospect, shareholder democracy issues should have been considered when these derivative securities were being invented and allowed to trade. But they were not. 
 Just why that happened is a question that Congress and the Obama administration should ponder as they revamp the American regulatory structure. Perhaps the S.E.C. would have considered the effects of divorcing votes from economic interest when the derivatives began trading. But some of these products were completely unregulated, and others went through the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, which in recent years was uninterested in regulating anything.
 In other words, if they are going to make it easier for shareholders to cast meaningful votes, perhaps they should also do something to assure that the voters have no financial interest in the company's failure. Henry T. C. Hu, a law professor at the University of Texas who has written extensively on this question, told me this week that it might make sense to require those casting large blocks of votes to certify they did not have an economic interest contrary to that of the company. But defining that could be treacherous. 
 The proposal put forth by the S.E.C. this week would let any holder, or group of holders, of at least 1 percent of the shares in large companies nominate a director candidate. To do that, the nominating group would have to certify that it was not interested in a takeover of the company, and that it had owned the shares for at least one year.
 How many directors could be so nominated? Up to a quarter of the board, so two seats could be contested if the board had eight members. And if two groups want to make nominations for one seat? The first one in gets on the ballot. 
 That holding period could raise its own questions. If an institution lends out shares for shorting, it at least theoretically also lends out the voting rights. Does that loan stop the holding period? If so, would that cause some institutions to stop lending shares, making it harder to short stocks and perhaps contributing to market volatility? 
 If a director contest does emerge, the proxy sent out by a company might end up listing five candidates for four seats. We're all used to that in political campaigns, but it is unheard of in corporate contests. In conventional proxy fights, each side sends out its own ballot. If you support management, sign the white card, which lists only its candidates. If you support the insurgents, sign the blue card.
 Decades ago, it was very expensive to mount such a proxy fight, given the cost of mailings to individual shareholders who collectively dominated many companies. Now, however, a majority of votes is often held by a relatively small number of institutions, and a proxy fight can be mounted for much less, with communications done by phone and e-mail with major holders. The individual investors may never be contacted.
 A few years ago, it appeared to be a sure thing that a much milder rule on shareholder access would be adopted. That rule, endorsed by William H. Donaldson, then the S.E.C. chairman, set up a lot of hoops to be leaped through before an institutional shareholder could nominate a rival candidate to appear on the company's proxy.
 Mr. Donaldson, a Republican, had the support of two of the other four commissioners and could have forced through a rule. But his supporters were Democrats. Republicans bemoaned his lack of party loyalty and he did not bring the issue to a vote. He was eventually succeeded by Christopher Cox, who pronounced ''consensus'' to be his goal. Shareholder access was dead.
 Since then, some companies have made it easier for shareholders to reject directors by requiring majority voting for elections. If an unopposed candidate is opposed by more owners of most shares being voted, no one is elected to the seat. A pending rule of the New York Stock Exchange would bar incumbents from being backed by brokers who are voting shares owned by clients who did not bother to vote. Had that rule been in effect this year, two Citigroup directors would have been denied re-election.
 In principle, shareholder access seems to be an obvious good idea. Companies do, after all, belong to their shareholders. We will see if this does become, as its advocates forecast, a rarely used instrument to change companies whose boards have failed to perform adequately, or if it will lead to a series of bitter battles -- sometimes instituted by institutions with ulterior motives -- that result in divided boards and divert both directors and managers from running companies to benefit all shareholders.

HEADLINE: Investors Shaken Over Government Debt

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Another bad signal from the job market and concern over a possible downgrade of British government debt sent stocks sharply lower Thursday.
 Major stock indicators slid more than 1.5 percent, cutting nearly 130 points off the Dow Jones industrial average, after continuing claims for unemployment benefits were worse than analysts had expected. 
 A report from Standard & Poor's said Britain might have its rating cut because of rising debt levels, which added to recent anxiety that the market may have moved too high too quickly on early signs of economic recovery.
 The report led investors to worry about how well governments worldwide, including in the United States, can keep up with public spending to stimulate their economies. 
 ''It raises questions about our own situation in terms of our deficits and our national debt,'' said Alan F. Skrainka, chief market strategist at Edward Jones, of the S.& P. report. ''There are limits to how high you can take these numbers longer term.''
 The report weighed on bond prices. The Treasury's 10-year note fell 1 15/32, to 97 31/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 3.36 percent, from 3.19 percent late Wednesday.
 The Dow fell 129.91, or 1.54 percent, to 8,292.13, after earlier falling as much as 201 points. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 15.14, or 1.68 percent, to 888.33, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 32.59, or 1.89 percent, to 1,695.25.
 In Europe, stocks fell after the S.& P. warning about Britain's debt. The FTSE 100 in London tumbled 2.8 percent. Germany's DAX index fell 2.7 percent, and France's CAC-40 lost 2.6 percent.
 Some segments of the market fared better. Shares of General Motors jumped more than 15 percent in the last hour of trading after the company reached a tentative deal with the United Automobile Workers on concessions. The move is a major step toward G.M.'s efforts to reorganize outside of bankruptcy court.
 Analysts also say that a pullback is healthy in light of the market's two-month surge.
 ''A little bit of relief just makes sense,'' said Ron Weiner, president and chief executive of RDM Financial in Westport, Conn. ''People are starting to understand that all these taxes and stimulus are probably not going to lead to a great, roaring recovery and some of these stocks may have gotten ahead of themselves.''
 Shares of large banks rose, helping to curb the market's overall losses, after Goldman Sachs raised its rating on large banks to neutral.
 JPMorgan Chase added 35 cents to close $34.90, while Wells Fargo rose 58 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $25.04.
 Regional bank stocks, however, suffered. Regions Financial tumbled 79 cents, or 16.2 percent, to $4.10 after it priced a public stock offering at a big discount. Fifth Third Bancorp fell 76 cents, or 9.9 percent, to $6.95, while Huntington Bancshares lost 52 cents, or 10.8 percent, to $4.30. Both banks also announced plans to raise their capital through public stock offerings.
 Following are the results of Thursday's auction of 70-day cash management bills:

HEADLINE: THE LISTINGS

BYLINE: Compiled by LAWRENCE VAN GELDER

 BODY:
ART
 Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.comart. 
 Museums
 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'THE TREASURE OF ULYSSES DAVIS,' through Sept. 6. Ulysses Davis (1914-1990) was a Savannah, Ga., barber who whittled and carved wooden sculptures in his shop when business was slow. Organized by the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, this show is by far the largest presentation of Mr. Davis's sculpture to be seen outside Savannah and the first to reveal the full scope of his imagination. His best-known works, carvings of historical figures, take a backseat to hybrid beasts and hydra-headed figures. It makes clear that he wasn't just a patriotic folk artist, or an African-American artist affirming his heritage, or an inward-looking visionary artist. He was all of these, which is to say that no single cliche of ''outsider'' art quite fits him. 45 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. 20090521
 (Karen Rosenberg) 
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'GUSTAVE CAILLEBOTTE: IMPRESSIONIST PAINTINGS FROM PARIS TO THE SEA,' through July 5. Thirty-some years ago, the museum had a big success with a Caillebotte retrospective that more or less introduced American audiences to an artist who was an Impressionist by association rather than by style or temperament. His three best-known pictures, ''The Floor Scrapers,'' ''The Pont de l'Europe'' and ''Paris Street, Rainy Day,'' all grand urban scenes from the late 1870s, are absent from this show, which is a more modest enterprise than a survey, with emphasis falling on less-focused late work. But Caillebotte was a painter as interesting for his weaknesses as for his strengths, and any exposure is valuable. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)20090521
 COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'FASHIONING FELT,' through Sept. 7. Tribute is paid to the world's oldest textile (no loom required) in all its sturdy, cosseting, beautiful, shape-shifting, dye-friendly majesty. The show includes contemporary furnishings, garments, jewelry and room dividers as well as two large installation works. The felt runs from raw to cooked -- that is furry to gossamer -- and in some of the most intriguing instances it is mated with lacquer, plastic, LED lights, metal or coral beads, as well as silk, linen or cotton. There are episodes of frivolity. A few earlier works -- including a Mongolian runner and a saddle blanket -- reunite function and decoration and distort familiar motifs in wonderful ways. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, cooperhewitt.org. (Roberta Smith)20090521
 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'AVEDON FASHION: 1944-2000,' through Sept. 6. The first museum retrospective devoted to Richard Avedon's fashion photography exudes a contagious joie de vivre. With postwar Paris as a stage set, Avedon made fashion photography new by adding movement and then narrative to his images, along with ironic self-awareness and a buoyant exuberance. The best of his early images are as perfect as the best work of Jackson Pollock or Jasper Johns from this period and as profoundly representative of it. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, www.icp.org. (Smith)20090521
 THE JEWISH MUSEUM: 'THEY CALLED ME MAYER JULY: PAINTED MEMORIES OF A JEWISH CHILDHOOD IN POLAND BEFORE THE HOLOCAUST,' through Oct. 1. Introducing the reluctant painter and accidental memoirist Mayer Kirschenblatt, now 92, who has devoted the last two decades to documenting life between the wars in and around the provincial city of Opatow (Apt in Yiddish), Poland. Wrought with irresistible detail and folk-art dispatch, the paintings begin with his mother's kitchen and reflect an omnivorous curiosity about everyday everything, aided by an apparently photographic memory. Labels pick up where the paintings leave off; words and images combine in a marvel of a book accomplished in collaboration with the artist's daughter, a folklorist whose career choice was shaped by her father's stories. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street,, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Smith)20090521
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE PICTURES GENERATION, 1974-1984,'through Aug. 2. With this historical survey, the Met tackles a subject in American contemporary art -- namely, a critical and innovative body of media-influenced work produced between two major economic booms -- that has been begging for full-scale museum attention, and gives it the full old master treatment. Much of the art itself -- painting, drawing, sculpture, photography, video, installation, prints, music and books by 30 artists, most of them still active and caught young here -- continues to look good. There are things to quarrel with, from the sweeping ''generation'' concept to a surprising, un-Met-like factual error in the wall labels: the original ''Pictures'' show had five artists, not four; one, Philip Smith, has been deliberately excised here in the interest of writing a neater history. Still, the show is a big step into the pertinent present for this museum.(212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)20090521
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'COMPASS IN HAND: SELECTIONS FROM THE JUDITH ROTHSCHILD FOUNDATION CONTEMPORARY DRAWINGS COLLECTION,'through Jan. 4. The Modern's largest gift of drawings -- a windfall of 2,500 works by 650 artists -- started out as a kind of stunt and matured without becoming a triumph. Initially a yearlong shopping binge in pursuit of a ''cross section'' of drawing at a certain moment, it also tried to fill decades-old gaps in the Modern's drawing collection, often with works by familiar names. These dominate the sampling of the gift: a lackluster exhibition of 354 works by 177 artists that emphasizes the Modern's ambivalence about moving beyond the Minimalism/Post-Minimalist canon, and its tendency to pick big or hot names over truly great drawings. The bottom line? Connoisseurship matters.(212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20090521
 STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'KALUP LINZY: IF IT DON'T FIT,' through June 28. Kalup Linzy's video work, in which the artist appears in drag and lends his overdubbed voice to almost all the characters, has a complex ancestry. A family tree would have to include the Wayans brothers, RuPaul, John Waters and Eddie Murphy on one branch, and the highbrow canon of dress-up artists, from Cindy Sherman to Yasumasa Morimura, on another. Mr. Linzy's first museum solo includes 22 videos made since 2002, with a total running time of about three hours. It includes his series ''Da Churen,'' his antic reimagining of the popular soap opera ''All My Children''; more recent episodes focus on the art world and feature Mr. Linzy's newest persona, Katonya the emerging artist.

 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'SADIE BENNING: PLAY PAUSE,'through Sept. 20. A new stop-action animation by this former film prodigy uses an avalanche of simple, almost naive gouache drawings, sometimes tinted with color, to prowl the margins of urban society. The result is low-key with undercurrents: a picture of the everyday sublime riddled with suggestions of longing, otherness and the difficulties of connection. Solveig Nelson has provided its beautifully accurate (yet largely electronic) soundtrack of city sounds, whether a subway singer or squirrels rifling through a garbage can, people talking in a bar or gates being called in an airport.(212) 570-3600, whitney.org.

 ERNESTO NETO: 'ANTHROPODINO' through June 14. A spectacular dream of an installation of gauzy fabric, dangling pods, dinosaurish wooden bones and cavernous interiors occupies much of the Park Avenue Armory's 55,000-square-foot, 80-foot-high Wade Thompson Drill Hall. With its domed central structure and ethereal canopy, Mr. Neto's construction glows like a magical destination in a children's movie.

 JACK YOUNGERMAN: 'TRIADS/QUADRADS,' through June 26. Mr. Youngerman's new paintings have an exhilarating punch. In bright, Playskool colors and with a direct, slightly brushy touch, he has been creating centered, hard-edged abstractions on star-, diamond-, three-leaf-clover- and oval-shaped plywood panels. They have a numinous vibe, like altar paintings for a pagan cult or heraldic emblems for a mystical knighthood. Washburn Gallery, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 397-6780, washburngallery.com.

 PHIL COLLINS: 'WHEN SLAVES LOVE EACH OTHER, IT'S NOT LOVE,' through June 20. The main attraction in this video-making conceptualist's show is a sophisticated parody of a Spanish television soap opera made in Mexico City using professional television actors. The 28-minute film tells a tangled tale of love, intrigue, betrayal and murder involving two maids, a gardener and the wealthy couple they work for. Though not as funny or imaginative as it should be, it is entertaining. Tanya Bonakdar, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 414-4144, tanyabonakdargallery.com. 20090521

 RON NAGLE: 'BOOKENDS, WEEORAMAS AND FLAREWARE,' through May 30. This California artist has been creating small ceramic wonders since the 1960s. The eight delightful and diminutive sculptures in this show revolve around the form of bookends: twin, L-shaped structures between which you could sandwich a couple of slim volumes of poetry. The cracker-thin ends have matte, granular surfaces lovingly glazed in hues ranging from earthy grays to Sunday funnies primaries. They also have sexually and scatologically suggestive elements nicely offsetting the hallucinogenic beauty. George Adams Gallery, 525 West 26th Street, (212) 564-8480, georgeadamsgallery.com. (Johnson)20090521
 CHARLES RAY, through June 27. More than 20 years ago Mr. Ray created a piece of kinetic sculpture that became famous even though hardly anyone saw it: ''Ink Line'' (1987), a fine stream of black ink flowing from a little hole in the ceiling to another in the floor. It is here publicly exhibited for the first time, along with two other pieces from the '80s: ''Moving Wire,'' in which the ends of a length of wire snake in and out of fine holes drilled into the wall, and ''Spinning Spot,'' a circular section of the floor, 24 inches in diameter, spinning at 33 1/3 r.p.m. Matthew Marks Gallery, 523 West 24th Street, (212) 243-0200, matthewmarks.com.

 GLENN GOLDBERG: 'WELCOME'; closes on Saturday. Glenn Goldberg's paintings of birds and flowers are bright accumulations of colorful pointillist dots that bring to mind both samplers and mandalas. This show includes pieces large (for him) and small, and adds fluid-filled, blown-glass sculptures that look like a cross between ritual instruments and toys. The effect is disciplined and pixilated, like a spring picnic with a shaman. Luise Ross Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, Chelsea, third floor, (212) 343-2161, luiserossgallery.com. (Cotter)20090521
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'ON THE MONEY: CARTOONS FOR THE NEW YORKER'; closes on Sunday. Go to this exhibition and you will see not only how money is like a cartoon, but also how cartoons shed light on money. In more than 80 drawings, the complexities of economic theory dissolve into the far more pungent currency of social relations, of status and snobbery, pretense and pride, distilling finance to its human essence. Money becomes a chit in the social game, a medium of exchange in a world careering between boom and bust. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org.

HEADLINE: On Credit Cards (and Guns in Parks)

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Dealing Consumers a New Hand in Credit Cards,'' by Ron Lieber (Your Money column, front page, May 20):
 It's hard to get excited about pending credit card legislation, which won't bring relief to consumers until early 2010.
 Before our elected officials pat themselves on the back, we should ask why they're giving banks and credit card lenders so much time to prepare for the changes while consumers are being pummeled with interest rates and penalties that would make any loan shark proud. 
 The same leaders who hurriedly approved taxpayer-financed bank bailouts are going to stand idly by as the new laws take effect only after millions of consumers fall into bankruptcy this year. 
 How can that make a bad situation better?
 It can't. Michael N. Chernick Montclair, N.J. May 20, 2009
 To the Editor:
 It is about time that someone put a check on the abuses of the credit card industry.
 Not that long ago, I remember receiving letters two or three times a week offering ''pre-approved'' credit cards at low or no beginning interest rates, no matter how bad or good my financial condition was at the time. 
 Too many were lured into signing up whether or not they could later make the payments. It clearly echoes the practice of luring obviously unqualified buyers into buying a new home and then their not being able to meet the payments later.
 While credit card users may eventually pay dearly for their use of credit, many users do not realize, too, that merchants pay interchange fees to the credit card companies for allowing customers to use the cards for purchases. These fees are either absorbed and consequently reduce profits or are passed on to customers by increasing the prices of the goods they sell.
 Claude M. Gruener Austin, Tex., May 20, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Bill Changing Credit Card Rules Is Sent to Obama With Gun Measure Included'' (news article, May 21):
 For those of us who oppose the presence of guns in the national parks, perhaps not all hope is lost. In a world that retains some inkling of sanity there are undoubtedly men and women of good conscience writing the bill to repeal the offending legislation. 
 Others, one hopes, are sitting at their desks writing regulations that require gun carriers to register their weapons at the entrance to the parks, pay a hefty (preferably prohibitive) fee for each gun, and require that those carrying guns display a sticker or other sign denoting compliance.
 We require that owners of cars and camping vehicles pay user fees and display proof thereof in these parks. Why not gun owners as well?
 David Dumitru St. Louis, May 21, 2009
 To the Editor:
 If I were the president, I would veto the credit card reform bill, since it allows people to carry weapons in national parks. Gun control is much more important than credit card reform. Credit cards affect only people's pockets; guns affect their lives.
 Manny Hillman Blue Point, N.Y., May 21, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Overhaul Likely for Credit Cards'' (front page, May 19): 
 To suggest, as some in the credit card industry do, that those who fully pay their balances each month, pay no annual fee and collect cash-back rewards and/or frequent flier miles are ''deadbeats'' or ''free riders'' in the eyes of card issuers is disingenuous. 
 The banks make very real and substantial fees off the merchants on each and every transaction charged, the cost of which is indirectly passed on to the consumer doing the charging in the form of higher prices to cover the operating costs. 
 One way or another, directly or indirectly, everyone pays for the use of credit cards.
 Gilbert Martin Arlington, Mass., May 19, 2009
 To the Editor:
 I was disturbed to read in your May 19 article that credit card companies were likely ''going after those people with sterling credit'' to make up for lost income.
 The credit card companies already get paid a handsome percentage of each transaction by the merchants and should not punish those of us who manage our credit well.
 Ellen Heidelberger Cortlandt Manor, N.Y., May 19, 2009
 To the Editor:
 I have always paid my credit card balances in full and on time. If any credit card issuer is not satisfied with the discount it charges vendors on my purchases and tries to charge me a yearly fee and interest on my purchases from the date of purchase, I will simply cancel my account, keeping one card for travel and emergencies.
 As for all the others, if they want more revenue from me, they will lose everything.

HEADLINE: New Michael Moore Film To Come Out In October

BYLINE: Compiled by DAVE ITZKOFF

 BODY:
A new documentary fromMichael Moore, right, the director of ''Bowling for Columbine'' and ''Fahrenheit 9/11,'' will be released on Oct. 2. The studios Overture Films and Paramount Vantage announced on Thursday that they would handle the United States release of the film, a still untitled movie about the global economic downturn. In a statement the studios said that the documentary would ''take a comical look at the corporate and political shenanigans'' that resulted in the worldwide recession. The film, announced at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival, follows ''Sicko,'' Mr. Moore's 2007 documentary about the American health care system.

HEADLINE: Seeing the Hudson River Through 700 Windows

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
It was the sight of 700 mullioned windows covered with greasy plastic sheeting that inspired the Brooklyn artist Spencer Finch to create the first temporary public art commission for the High Line, that $170 million park being built on the elevated freight rail structure that stretches 22 blocks, from Gansevoort Street to 34th Street, near the Hudson River.
 ''Those industrial New York spaces are disappearing,'' said Mr. Finch, who is known for work that explores the relationship between light and color. His new piece will be housed in a tunnel-like former loading dock between 15th and 16th Streets. ''I thought that rather than drop something of my own making in the space, I would use the existing architecture.''
 Since the Hudson River is visible from the site, Mr. Finch wanted the art to capture the narrative of the river. So last June 12 he fastened a high-resolution digital camera to the railing of a tugboat and documented an 11-hour 40-minute journey on the river in a single day. 
 Traveling on Manhattan's West Side past the High Line, Mr. Finch photographed a single point on the river's surface every minute of his journey. He then chose a single pixel from each photograph, sandwiched each one between glass and has arranged them chronologically in the former loading dock's steel mullions. 
 He organized the panels as though viewers were ''reading a book,'' he said, placing them in a sequence that starts at 9:15 a.m. and goes until 8:54 p.m., from left to right, top to bottom, capturing the changing reflective and translucent conditions of the water's surface. 
 ''It's lighter at the top than at the bottom,'' he explained. ''I wanted to make this as much a narrative as a composite.'' 
 Because this is one of the few semi-enclosed spaces on the High Line, Meredith Johnson, a curator and producer at Creative Time, the organization that has helped present Mr. Finch's project, said ''it has a cathedral-like feeling.'' The space will be illuminated at night to approximate daylight, so viewers can see the panels around the clock. 
 The title of the work, ''The River That Flows Both Ways,'' is a translation of Muhheakantuck, the American Indian name for the Hudson, and refers to the river's natural flow in two directions, like the trains that once ran on the High Line. 
 The project, which will be on view for a year starting in mid-June, was commissioned by two nonprofit organizations -- Creative Time, which presents art around the city, and Friends of the High Line -- as well as the New York City Parks and Recreation Department. 
 ''Art has always been an important component,'' said Robert Hammond, co-founder of Friends of the High Line. ''From the beginning dealers and artists were some of our most ardent constituents. We knew we wanted something that was temporary and didn't want plot art. We also didn't want to make it an outdoor sculpture park.'' 
 To ensure a continuing stream of art projects, Friends of the High Line recently hired Lauren Ross, a former interim curator at the Brooklyn Museum who was also a director and chief curator at White Columns, to oversee its arts programming with a focus on emerging artists and site-specific commissions. 
 THE ART OF STEEL BEAMS
 In 1984 the conceptual artist Chris Burden created ''Beam Drop,'' a sculptural project in which a hydraulic crane hoisted 60 steel beams a hundred feet into the air and then dropped them into a pool of wet concrete 30 feet square. 
 The site was Artpark, a 200-acre state park in Lewiston, N.Y., about 10 miles north of Niagara Falls on the Canadian border. 
 Three years later ''Beam Drop'' was dismantled and destroyed.
 Now an even bigger version of the work has risen again, this time in Brazil at the Inhotim Center for Contemporary Art, a three-year-old museum and botanical garden on 3,000 acres outside the city of Belo Horizonte. The center was founded by Bernardo Paz, a Brazilian collector and mining magnate who began collecting art in the early 1990s. 
 The center is known for outsized permanent projects by artists like Matthew Barney, Pipilotti Rist, Olafur Eliasson and Doug Aitken. 
 ''I think 'Beam Drop' is one of the most important large-scale sculptures in modern art,'' said Allan Schwartzman, the chief curator of Inhotim. ''It's both a summation and a deconstruction of sculpture.'' 
 This version of ''Beam Drop'' consists of 71 beams, many of them larger and heavier than those in the original work. ''We spent six months scouring the region for old steel I-beams of various sizes, forms and colors,'' Mr. Schwartzman said, ''including several beams that had been part of a turn-of-the-century industrial bridge.'' 
 Inhotim is not the only place to see a version of Mr. Burden's ''Beam Drop'' this season. On May 30 ''Beam Drop Antwerp'' will be constructed before a live audience in the sculpture park of the Middelheim Museum in Antwerp. The city will also host an exhibition of other work by Mr. Burden in the Braem Pavilion and Middelheim Castle.
 NEW GALLERY IN TOWN
 While many galleries are paring down the number of exhibitions they present, shrinking their staffs or closing altogether, Hauser & Wirth -- a 17-year-old business that operates exhibition spaces in London and Zurich -- has decided to open a gallery in New York. It will be primarily devoted to artists it represents, an international group that includes Louise Bourgeois, Dan Graham, Subodh Gupta and Paul McCarthy. 
 ''The economic crisis is not stopping us,'' said Iwan Wirth, one of the gallery's founders. ''This is a long-term strategy.'' 
 For several years now it has had office space in Manhattan at 32 East 69th Street, in a building where Zwirner & Wirth is located. (Zwirner & Wirth, which mostly handles modern masters, is owned in part by Iwan Wirth and the New York dealer David Zwirner.) 
 Hauser & Wirth will now take over all four floors of the building, and Annabelle Selldorf, the New York architect, will design the space. (Zwirner & Wirth will no longer have a gallery in New York, but David Zwirner will open his own space at 524 West 19th Street in the fall.) 
 When Hauser & Wirth opens in September it will be showing ''Yard,'' an environment created by Allan Kaprow, the artist who coined the term ''Happenings'' in the 1950s and who died three years ago. ''Yard,'' from 1961, consists of a massing of used automobile tires.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 23, 2009

 CORRECTION:
A report in the Inside Art column on Friday about the opening of the Hauser & Wirth gallery in New York next September, using information provided by the gallery, referred incompletely to the Hauser & Wirth company's relationship with the artist Louise Bourgeois. Although it represents her, it does so only in Europe -- not in New York or elsewhere. (The Cheim & Read gallery represents her outside Europe.)

HEADLINE: China's Students Feel a Faint Tug From the Ghosts of Tiananmen

BYLINE: By SHARON LaFRANIERE; Jonathan Ansfield contributed reporting. Huang Yuanxi and Zhang Jing contributed research.

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
On April 30, the cellphones of the 32,630 students at Peking University, a genteel institution widely regarded as one of China's top universities, buzzed with a text message from the school administration. It warned students to ''pay attention to your speech and behavior'' on Youth Day because of a ''particularly complex'' situation.
 Few students had to puzzle over the meaning. Youth Day, on May 4, commemorates a 1919 student protest against foreign imperialism and China's weakness in resisting it. Seventy years later, in 1989, students from Peking University were again massing in the center of Beijing, demanding democracy. The student movement shook the ruling Communist Party to its core and ended with a military crackdown and hundreds of deaths.
 And if a student today proposed a pro-democracy protest? 
 ''People would think he was insane,'' said one Peking University history major in a recent interview. ''You know where the line is drawn. You can think, maybe talk, think about the events of 1989. You just cannot do something that will have any public influence. Everybody knows that.''
 Most students also appear to accept it. For 20 years, China's government has made it abundantly clear that students and professors should stick to the books and stay out of the streets. Students today describe 1989 as almost a historical blip, a moment too extreme and traumatic ever to repeat.
 But whether democracy still inspires them is a more complex question.
 Interviews with students and teachers at Peking University, as with experts on China here and abroad, draw a layered portrait of today's students: disinclined to protest, but also lacking the economic grievances that helped ignite protests in 1989; proud of China's achievements and flocking to the Communist Party, but seldom driven by ideology.
 They are disturbed by government corruption and censorship and are eager to study in the West, especially the United States. And despite the government's attempts to wipe the 1989 protests from Chinese history, some have learned what happened. All but one of eight Peking University students interviewed for this article, for instance, said they had managed to download an acclaimed -- and banned -- documentary on the Tiananmen protests and view it in their dorm rooms.
 ''There is a stereotypical view that students are not interested in democracy. I don't buy it,'' Cheng Li, research director of the China Center at the Brookings Institution, said in an interview. ''At the very least, they have a mixed opinion of the Communist Party.''
 Xia Yeliang, a Peking University professor, said many students supported democracy in theory but did not want to risk their futures to fight for it. Students joke that they will get involved once pro-democracy forces gather steam, he said. ''A rather high percentage of students are not interested in politics,'' he said. ''They say, 'We know this is a good thing, but what relation does it have to us?' They think about their personal affairs, how to get a job, how to go abroad.''
 Even the mouthpiece of the Communist Party, People's Daily, laments a general lack of idealism on campus. ''Many university students are clearly very utilitarian in their thinking,'' People's Forum, a magazine published by People's Daily, complained this month after a conducting a student survey. ''Everything is based on 'whether or not it is useful to me,' '' the magazine said.
 In fact, today's students have more to lose than did protesters 20 years ago. Then, university students believed that their futures were endangered by a soaring inflation rate of 28 percent, rampant government corruption and shrinking job prospects, according to a 2001 book on the Tiananmen movement by Dingxin Zhao, a University of Chicago sociology professor. Many had lost hope in the government's economic reforms.
 Today, even students who criticize Communist rule are gratified by China's great strides. ''Sometimes we don't like the policies of our government,'' said Wang Yongli, a fourth-year physics major. ''But on the other hand, nowadays we are proud of the country and the government because they have moved so many people to a better life.''
 The Communist Party is careful to cultivate this image, while seeking to defuse longings for democracy by vowing to govern ''democratically.''
 Officials say they oppose Western-style multiparty democracy as wrong for China, but embrace the idea of consultation, public review and balloting under party rule. China will open up the political system, step by step, as the country becomes wealthier and more stable, officials promise.
 Some China analysts suggest that student discontent could rise if the current economic crisis clouds their futures. China sends nine times as many students to institutions of higher education now as it did in 1989, and competition for good jobs is fierce. Nearly one in four graduates last year could not find work, Xinhua, the state-run news agency, reported.
 But since 1989, Communist Party leaders have realized that they ignore youth at their peril. The government is now trying to ease job anxieties with training programs and incentives for graduates to work in rural areas. ''If you are worried, then I am more worried than you,'' Prime Minister Wen Jiabao told one student group in December.
 The party has also ratcheted up recruitment and political education, making college students the party's fastest-growing segment, said Susan L. Shirk, a political science professor at the University of California, San Diego. More than 8 percent of all students were party members in 2007, compared with fewer than 1 percent in 1989. At elite institutions like Peking University, percentages are much higher.
 Some of those students echo the party's line that Western-style democracy does not suit China. ''China has a large population, and education has a long way to go,'' said Song Chao, a Peking University ecology major. ''Considering that, we need to put some regulations on people. The major task for China now is development.''
 Others hope to nudge the party toward reform. ''Of course, if we could become a democratic society, we would like that,'' said another history major and party aspirant. ''But this is not something you can achieve by radical means. What if there is chaos?'' 
 But a majority of students seek party membership not as an ideological statement but rather as a means to a better job, the survey published by People's Forum concluded. At Peking University, many students say they nap through the university's much mocked, though mandatory, political thought classes. ''Even the teachers know they are teaching rubbish,'' one senior said.
 Most students will make such statements only anonymously because government control of campus speech remains tight. Professors say some students are assigned to report to administrators if they hear teachers adopting antigovernment lines. Most students interviewed for this article did not want to be identified, saying their comments might be negatively noted in their files.
 Five years ago, the university shut down a computer bulletin board -- a vibrant hub of information for 300,000 users -- after the central government's education minister complained that it did not always reflect ''the right view.'' Students say they are careful about what they write on the new, restricted and monitored board because their identities can be traced.
 Surveys show that four of five university students still rely on China's heavily censored media for their news. But in a digital age when nearly 70,000 Chinese students are studying in the United States and roughly 163,000 foreign students study at Chinese universities, walls against information are porous.
 One senior recalled an excruciating roundtable discussion with foreign journalists who visited Peking University in 2007 and asked about the government crackdown on student demonstrators in 1989. ''They always ask about this June 4 incident, and we just keep silent,'' she said. ''It is not because we don't want to talk. It is because we have no idea what exactly happened!
 ''I felt a little bit humiliated because we don't know our own history,'' she said. ''So I went to the library and I read about June 4. Basically, everything was written by foreign journalists.''
 The curbs on public debate can reduce even political controversies on campus to the status of rumors. Two Peking University professors were among the first to sign Charter 08, an online pro-democracy manifesto released in December and backed by many intellectuals.
 After signing, Professor Xia, the economist, said he was forced to resign from positions at two research institutes. His fellow signer, He Weifang, a celebrated law professor, was transferred to an obscure college in China's far west. Professor He's exile was news overseas. But much like the coming anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown, it drew little notice from students.
 One student defended the professor with an anonymous post on the campus's computer bulletin board. ''The day will come,'' he wrote, ''when Professor He can go where he wants.''

 James Cromitie
 Officials identified the leader as James Cromitie, a career criminal born in Brooklyn on Dec. 24, 1964. Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said he had a record of 27 arrests, at least a dozen for drug offenses, beginning in 1987. He spent a total of 12 years in state prison, the most recent stint for a 1998 conviction for selling cocaine to an undercover officer behind a school in the Bronx.
 He was paroled in 2004 and moved to Newburgh from the Bronx in March 2005.
 His mother, Adele Cromitie, 65, said she had last seen her son three years ago, when he came to her apartment in the Castle Hill neighborhood of the Bronx, where she has lived for 26 years. It was the first time she had seen him in years. 
 He took her up to Newburgh and introduced her to the woman he was living with and said that he had become a Muslim. He was raised an Episcopalian, she said. In his first jail stint he listed his religion as Baptist; in the second and third ones, as Muslim.
 Mr. Cromitie's sister, Wanda Walker, said she was shocked to learn of her brother's arrest while watching television Thursday morning. She said she was unaware that her brother may have had extreme political views. She had last spoken to him about two years ago when she thought he was working at a Wal-Mart or Kmart store.
 ''Right now, to me he's, like, the dumbest person I ever came in contact with in my life,'' Ms. Walker said. She added that as far as she knew, he was not a Muslim, but said ''they do a little time in jail and they don't eat pork no more.''
 Ms. Cromitie and her daughter said that Mr. Cromitie was in the middle in a family of 10 children, and was raised on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.
 Ms. Cromitie said her son had a nickname as a child: ''Fildee,'' for a character in an old TV commercial who used to encourage throwing trash in trash cans by saying, ''fill dee basket.''
 His sister, Ms. Walker, remembered him as a jokester, always singing gospel songs or oldies and mimicking Smokey Robinson or Luther Vandross. 
 ''You could be down, on your downest day and downest luck, and he'd make you laugh,'' Ms. Walker said. ''I'm still waiting for the punch line of all of this.''
 Ms. Cromitie said Mr. Cromitie's father, James Walker, left when James Cromitie was 3 years old. She said she had seen him only once in more than 20 years.
 She raised 10 children on her own. ''He never did anything for Fildee,'' she said about the father. Although Mr. Cromitie was said to have told people his parents had lived in Afghanistan, Ms. Cromitie and Ms. Walker said the family had no ties to that country.
 Those who lived around Mr. Cromitie on Lake Drive in Newburgh described his as a good-natured neighbor who never spoke of religion or politics. 
 ''To hear this just blew my mind,'' said one neighbor, who gave her name as Kristina L. ''I would have never assumed he was a terrorist.''
 Onta Williams
 Onta Williams, also known as Hamza, was born on June 29, 1976, in Newburgh, and his father left him when he was young. He went to prison in the mid-1990s on a drug charge, and there he converted to Islam, said an uncle, Richard Williams. In 2003 he went to federal prison on drug charges.
 He was addicted to crack and cocaine since he was 15 or 16, a lawyer of his, Sol Lesser, said, according to a court transcript of his sentencing in April 2003.
 Onta Williams's mother died just before he was released from prison in July 2007, said Richard Williams. He also separated from his wife in the last three years. 
 He loves to eat, and was a good football player in junior high, his uncle said. He has a 14-year-old son and a 6-year-old daughter, and moved in with a new girlfriend and her son in Newburgh in February.
 Mr. Williams said his nephew worked at CNS, a loading company, and spent his free time at a mosque or with fellow Muslims. The uncle said that he, too, served time in prison and became wary of the converted Muslims he met inside. 
 He said that because of this, he tried to warn his nephew, but to no avail. ''I did not condone his religion, but when I talked to him about it he would say to me, 'You can't tell me anything about the Muslim religion because they're my supporters and they're my family,' '' Richard Williams said. ''He told me, 'They're more my family than you.' '' 
 In recent weeks Richard Williams said he rarely saw Onta Williams, despite pleas. Richard said he fell ill with flu and, worried that it was swine flu, begged Onta to come bring him medicine. Onta ignored him, he said.
 ''This ordeal, whatever was going on was the reason he wouldn't come to visit me,'' Richard Williams said.
 David Williams IV
 David Williams IV, not related to Onta Williams, was born on Feb. 9, 1981. His mother, Elizabeth McWilliams, said he was raised in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, with two younger brothers. He lived in East New York, Brooklyn, but spent a lot of time at his mother's house in Newburgh, a few doors down from Mr. Cromitie. 
 At an appearance on Thursday in Federal District Court in White Plains, Eric Snyder, an assistant United States attorney, said Mr. Williams -- referred to in court papers as Daoud and DL -- was, ''bragging, boasting, that he would shoot anyone who tried to stop him.'' 
 According to the prosecutor, Mr. Williams bought a pistol in a Brooklyn housing project for $700 from a man Mr. Williams described to an F.B.I. informer as a ''supreme Blood gang leader.'' And he told the informant that if the informant hadn't been there when he made the purchase, he would have killed the gun seller and kept the $700, said Mr. Snyder, the prosecutor.
 His mother said he served time in prison on a drug charge. Arrested in 2003 with cocaine in his pocket, he was sentenced to up to three years in prison after pleading guilty, according to a transcript of his February 2005 parole hearing.
 But now, she said, he had been getting his life together: He had worked for six months in the kitchen at Boulder Creek Steakhouse in the Spring Creek area of Brooklyn, but left two months ago; he studied computers at ASA Institute in Downtown Brooklyn.
 He has a 7-year-old daughter and an infant son, and was recommitting to them, his mother said. She said he never talked about religion -- and she said that though the family is Roman Catholic, he is Muslim, a religion he got from his father. 
 Co-workers at the steakhouse, in the Gateway Center Mall, said Mr. Williams was something of a ladies' man. ''He was always reading books on the line when it was slow,'' said one co-worker who did not give her name because her bosses had forbade employees to talk to reporters. ''Always reading an Arab book, the Koran, I think.''
 Aahkiyaah Cummings, Mr. Williams's aunt, said the last time she saw him, about a week ago, he seemed distant. Ms. Cummings said she gave Mr. Williams a hug outside his mother's apartment and felt a change.
 ''You know your family, and one of the things I always looked forward to was a hug from David because there was such realness, such love,'' she said. ''But after I embraced him I said to my husband: 'Something is not right. You need to talk to him.' '' 
 Laguerre Payen
 Laguerre Payen was born in Haiti on Sept. 24, 1981, officials said. In 2002, he shot two 16-year-olds with a BB gun on Route 59 in Monsey, N.Y., according to his January 2005 parole hearing transcript; one was hit near his left eye, the other behind an ear, according to court records. 
 He served about 15 months in prison, where he reported himself as Roman Catholic, but converted to Islam there, according to Hamin Rashada, an assistant imam from the Islamic Learning Center of Orange County. He counseled Mr. Payen in a program to help former prisoners re-enter the outside world. 
 He was quiet and evasive, unemployed and poor, shifting between rooming houses and homelessness; but he was working to readjust to society, Mr. Rashada said. ''He has some very serious psychological problems,'' he said, adding that Mr. Payen was on medications and talked in circles.
 The imam said Mr. Payen had a shallow and misguided understanding of Islam. He said he asked Mr. Payen if he had extremist views about the government. ''He said, 'Mr. Rashada, I can't even get a job here because I'm not a citizen, I don't involve myself in that type of stuff.' ''
 Mr. Payen has a 3-year-old son, who lives with his mother elsewhere in Orange County, Mr. Rashada said. 
 Immigration officials would not say if Mr. Payen had been in the country legally, and it was unclear when he came to the United States, but at his parole hearing in November 2004 he told the judge he was ''a legal resident.''
 Shortly thereafter, however, Immigration and Customs Enforcement began deportation proceedings because of his criminal conviction. An immigration judge issued a deportation order against Mr. Payen on Sept. 27, 2008, immigration officials said. But the judge's order also blocked his immediate removal from the country, officials said, giving no further details. 
 In some cases, a judge may issue a deportation order and, at the same time, temporarily block the deportation if the defendant can prove that he would suffer severe persecution or torture in his homeland. It is unclear whether such an argument was used in Mr. Payen's case. 
 While some people facing deportation, particularly violent criminals, are held in detention centers, others are released and ordered to report periodically to the authorities until their removal from the country.
 Immigration officials said Mr. Payen had been released under these terms and had been reporting ''regularly.''

HEADLINE: Intel and Competition

 BODY:
As American regulators slept through the past eight years, several authorities overseas decided that the Intel Corporation has been abusing its near monopoly position in the microchip market to squeeze out its smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices, constraining consumers' choice. 
 It is now the United States' turn. The Federal Trade Commission, which opened a formal investigation into Intel's business a year ago, should decide without delay whether to pursue the company in court. The issue is not just whether Intel's tactics against A.M.D. amount to illicit behavior. The larger question is whether Washington is willing to pursue monopolies vigorously for predatory practices and foster an environment where competition and innovation can thrive. 
 Since 2005, regulators in Japan and South Korea have ruled against Intel. This month the European Commission slapped the company with a $1.44 billion fine. It found that Intel has been giving hidden rebates to computer makers that bought all or virtually all of their chips from Intel and paying some to delay or hinder the introduction of products that had A.M.D. microprocessors. 
 Intel denies those accusations, arguing that the volume rebates it offers never carried the alleged quid pro quos. The company appealed the Korean fine and said it would appeal the European decision.
 For much of the Bush administration, regulators declined to look formally into the charges against Intel. That reluctance was the product of an extremely narrow reading of antitrust law, validated by a conservative Supreme Court that has become increasingly hostile to antitrust enforcement.
 In the Bush administration's view, to get in trouble a monopolist must do worse than use unfair methods to undermine a competitor. Regulators must usually prove that consumers were directly hurt, typically through high prices. When the wrongdoing is to offer a client conditional rebates -- meaning lower prices -- that can be especially hard to prove.
 That view of consumer harm is too restrictive. It often seems to ignore the fact that a dominant firm that uses unfair tactics to marginalize its rivals deprives consumers of choice, another form of harm. Without competitors there is no competition. Without competition there is no incentive for innovation, or to reduce prices. 
 The Obama administration has a different view. The Justice Department's antitrust division has rescinded Bush administration guidelines intended to shield monopolies from antitrust accusations. The F.T.C. is also likely to be more active under its new chairman, Jon Leibowitz. He is already considering pursuing future antitrust cases with a little-used provision of antitrust law that directly outlaws unfair methods of competition. The American economy cannot thrive without antitrust laws. It is time to start enforcing them.

HEADLINE: California Begins Hunt for Deeper Cuts

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
Rejected by voters and rebuffed by the federal government, the Schwarzenegger administration told California lawmakers on Thursday that they must find $5.5 billion in new cuts to the state's budget, which already has a $21.3 billion deficit, in order to remain solvent. 
 As they revealed the latest gap, administration officials proposed a draconian set of cuts designed to close one of the largest shortfalls in modern history, including big reductions in the state's public education budget, the elimination of state financing for parks, the closing of at least one state agency and the sale of state assets. 
 On Tuesday, California voters rejected five ballot measures intended to close the budget gaps through a mix of temporary tax increases, borrowing and the reallocation of money from special programs into the state's general fund.
 Exacerbating the problem, the Obama administration on Thursday all but formally rejected a request by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger for a $6 billion loan guarantee to back the state's debt. Speaking to Congress, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said he was skeptical that he had the authority to provide aid to the state without new legislation, a view echoed by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs. 
 The state must now find more than $26 billion in savings over the next two fiscal years. On Thursday afternoon, legislators began that process, which must be complete by the end of the current fiscal year on July 1, in the first of a series of meetings and public hearings over the next few weeks.
 Calling the budget problem the worst she could recall, Noreen Evans, chairwoman of the Assembly Budget Committee, opened testimony with warnings of cuts and suggestions of new fees.
 ''The outlook is grim,'' said Ms. Evans, a Democrat from Santa Rosa. ''None of us are going to be happy.'' 
 Ms. Evans suggested that the state consider taxing makers of sugary drinks, which she said led to health problems in children, and perhaps charge oil extraction fees.
 In testimony before the legislative budget conference committee, Ana Matosantos, chief deputy director for budgets of the California Department of Finance, presented a somber slate of proposals from the governor, including $5.3 billion in reductions to schools (some of which would be recovered from the federal stimulus bill), the elimination of a state welfare program that gives cash aid and services to the poor, large reductions to the state's Medicaid program, universities and community colleges, and the movement to federal prisons of inmates awaiting deportation. The state might also stop financing parks altogether, taking federal money only, Ms. Matosantos said.
 Ms. Matosantos did not offer tax or fee increases as part of the solution, though she said the administration would seek $2.3 billion in accelerated payments of taxes due the state and $1 billion generated from the sale of the State's Compensation Insurance Fund.
 On Friday, the state controller, John Chiang, and the treasurer, Bill Lockyer, are expected to testify about the state's dire situation, followed by public hearings and intense budget negotiations between the Democratic-controlled Legislature and the Republican governor.

HEADLINE: Gap Inc. and Sears Post Profits Despite Sales Declines

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
Most mall retailers have been posting steep sales declines for months, but a few chains have learned how to weather the downturn. Some even reported the unthinkable: year over year profit increases. 
 On Thursday, Gap Inc., the apparel company that owns Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic, posted a profitof $215 million, or 31 cents a share, for the three months ended May 2, down 14 percent, from $249 million, or 34 cents a share, in the period a year ago. 
 Sales at stores open at least a year fell 8 percent to $3.13 billion, from $3.38 billion. That was better than the 11 percent decline in the period a year ago. 
 Analysts had expected a profit of 30 cents a share on revenue of $3.14 billion.
 Still, Gap Inc., which had been struggling even before the recession, has a way to go. Sales at stores open at least a year fell 12 percent at Gap, 13 percent at Banana Republic and 3 percent at Old Navy (that number was nonetheless better than Old Navy's 18 percent decline last year). 
 Glenn K. Murphy, Gap Inc.'s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement that he was encouraged by Old Navy's performance and that Gap Inc. was focusing on taking back market share. 
 Sears, the department store chain and mall anchor, reversed a loss from the quarter a year ago and posted a profit of $26 million, or 21 cents a share, for its first period. The company lost $56 million, or 43 cents a share, a year earlier.
 Still, sales fell to $10.06 billion, from $11.07 billion. Sales at Sears stores open at least a year fell 11.7 percent, hurt by weak sales of merchandise related to the housing market, including tools, home appliances and lawn and garden items. Sales at Kmart stores open at least a year declined 2.1 percent. Sears and Kmart are owned by Sears Holding.
 Another retailer, Limited Brands, which owns ubiquitous chains including Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works, posted a profit of $2.6 million, or 1 cent a share, in its first quarter ended May 2, down from $97.8 million, or 28 cents a share, last year. Sales at stores open at least a year fell 7 percent. 
 The best mall store news of the day came from low-price apparel retailers, Children's Place, Aeropostale and from Buckle, the teenage clothing chain. The chains have been among the strongest performers. 
 Children's Place posted a profit of $23.5 million, or 79 cents a share, compared with $19.5 million, or 67 cents a share, last year. Aeropostale posted a profit of $31.7 million, or 47 cents a share, up from $17.5 million, or 26 cents a share, last year. And Buckle reported a profit of $26.9 million, or 59 cents a share, up from $18.7 million, or 42 cents a share, last year.

HEADLINE: While Opposing a Tax on Theater Tickets, Broadway Added a Fee of Its Own

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY

 BODY:
Broadway theater owners and producers fought vigorously and successfully this winter to block a new state tax on theater tickets, saying such a levy would anger theater-goers and damage business during the recession. Yet at the same time, they were quietly imposing a new fee of their own on patrons of Broadway.
 Since November, the Broadway League -- the trade association of owners and producers -- has been charging a $1 ''league fee'' on most tickets bought at the TKTS discount booths in New York. The fee is on tickets for so-called league productions -- which include ''Phantom of the Opera,'' ''Chicago'' and most Broadway plays and musicals. 
 The fee is expected to yield almost $1 million a year for the league, whose leaders described the fee on Thursday as a major new revenue stream for their $6 million general fund to pay for marketing and education programs. The fee was approved in private by the league's board and was never announced, nor is there a public announcement at TKTS explaining the fee. It is simply noted on TKTS tickets, which are sold at as much as half off, as ''$1.00 Bway League Fee.'' 
 The New York Times learned of the fee on Thursday from a theater industry member.
 The imposition of the fee, approved by the league's board last year, stands in a sharp contrast to the group's denunciation of and aggressive lobbying against Gov. David A. Paterson's proposed theater ticket tax, which would have added about $5 to $10 to Broadway tickets, depending on their face value. 
 When Governor Paterson dropped the tax idea in March, Charlotte St. Martin, the executive director of the league, praised the decision. ''Our goal is to encourage theatergoers to support Broadway and New York City, and in these difficult economic times, higher ticket prices could be devastating to our industry,'' she said in a statement then.
 In an interview Thursday, Ms. St. Martin said that the league's board ''thought long and hard and hesitated before approving this fee.'' She said that producers and owners were sensitive to the high price of tickets -- and to the incongruity of adding a fee specifically on people who are seeking discounts at TKTS to go to the theater. The league has not imposed the fee on people who pay the full face value of tickets.
 The fee has generated as much as $18,000 a week for the league in TKTS sales, Ms. St. Martin said; other weeks the fee yields around $12,000.
 ''It's not ideal, I know, but the fee helps pay for things that have added value for theatergoers,'' Ms. St. Martin said, noting an expansion of theater education and children's programs and a video effort to puts league-related programs online so people nationwide can feel a connection to Broadway.
 ''We don't consider it a hidden fee, and anyone who asks about it, we're happy to explain it,'' she said. She also noted that producers and theater owners in the league were required to pay about 10 percent more in dues this season as well.
 A New York State assemblyman, Herman D. Farrell Jr., the chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, who was lobbied heavily to oppose the state tax on theater, was surprised to hear about the league fee.
 ''Anything that raises prices at this time -- taxes, levies or fees -- is a bad thing and a problem,'' Mr. Farrell said. But he added he would not inveigh too strongly against the new fee. ''I probably approved more taxes on more stuff than anyone else this year, so I can't scream too much about this,'' he said.
 The TKTS discount booths had no say in the league's decision, said Victoria Bailey, who oversees the booths as executive director of the Theater Development Fund. TKTS sold more than 1.4 million tickets from July 2007 through June 2008, and about one million tickets were believed to be for league productions.
 Asked about her own opinion of the league fee, Ms. Bailey said, ''Our customers care most about the show, its location and price. So anything that raises costs is a concern.''
 The TKTS booth sells tickets that are discounted by producers, mostly at 50 percent off but sometimes at 30 or 40 percent off. A full-priced $120 ticket to the Tony-winning musical ''Avenue Q,'' for instance, was selling for $66.50 on Thursday. This included half of the ticket's original face value; a $4 service fee from TKTS; a $1.50 facility fee to maintain the aging Broadway theaters; and, now, the $1 league fee.
 Among the dozen people interviewed as they left TKTS on Thursday, no one had noticed the fine print mentioning the league fee on their tickets. And none were especially upset by it.
 ''The ticket cost is high enough that an extra dollar doesn't really matter,'' said Tobin Bettivia, who had bought orchestra seats for ''Avenue Q'' with his girlfriend, Colie Huppertz.
 ''I don't know, it all seems a lot to me,'' Ms. Huppertz interjected. ''These little extra fees, I don't like them.''
 Micki Herman, visiting from Minneapolis, shrugged off the extra fee on her ticket to the musical ''Next to Normal.''
 ''I guess Broadway's got to make a buck,'' Ms. Herman said.

HEADLINE: Conferences On Mortgages Are Called Ineffective

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

 BODY:
They were hailed last year as a key component of Gov. David A. Paterson's efforts to prevent foreclosures: mandatory settlement conferences in which lenders and borrowers of subprime loans who are in default on their mortgages would hammer out new terms to keep the borrowers in their homes. 
 But two state lawmakers and a community group said on Thursday that the conferences had been largely ineffective in New York City and Nassau and Westchester Counties, where hundreds of scheduled sessions had resulted in a handful of settlements. 
 The lawmakers -- State Senator Jeffrey D. Klein and Assemblyman Hakeem Jeffries, who have introduced legislation to revamp the process -- said at a news conference that the program had had little impact since August, when Mr. Paterson signed a bill overhauling state foreclosure laws. The governor and leaders of the State Legislature had championed the legislation as a way to stem foreclosures and subprime lending. 
 The settlement conferences apply to subprime loans taken out from January 2003 to September 2008. 
 In Queens, 419 conferences scheduled for October to April led to 16 settlements. In Brooklyn, 759 conferences in the same period resulted in 22 settlements. In Nassau, 1,032 conferences from January to April led to 30 settlements, and in Westchester, 94 conferences from March to April resulted in 6. 
 The data are based on court records obtained by New York Acorn, a community organizing group that joined Mr. Jeffries, a Brooklyn Democrat, and Mr. Klein, a Democrat who represents parts of the Bronx and Westchester, at the news conference.
 The two lawmakers said that borrowers were going to the conferences ill prepared and with a lack of understanding about the foreclosure process, and that lenders were sending representatives who did not have the authority to modify loans. 
 ''Far more needs to be done to bring all parties to the negotiating table so that these bad loans can be modified,'' Mr. Jeffries said. ''It's clear that significant government intervention is necessary immediately and forcefully.''
 Morgan Hook, a spokesman for Mr. Paterson, defended the governor's antiforeclosure initiatives on Thursday. ''Governor Paterson has taken a national lead on this issue,'' Mr. Hook said. ''When he signed the foreclosure bill last year, New York became the first state to comprehensively address the foreclosure crisis. Our law has been a model that other states have used to write their own legislation.''
 In the program, the conferences must take place within 60 days after the lender files proof that the borrower has been served with legal papers. Lenders must also notify homeowners in writing at least 90 days before starting foreclosure proceedings. 
 Under the bill from Mr. Jeffries and Mr. Klein that was introduced in the Assembly and the State Senate this month, a borrower who enters the program must meet with a housing counselor before the settlement conference to work out a financial plan, which a lender can accept or reject. The current program does not require counseling.
 The bill is modeled after a similar program in Philadelphia that Acorn helped to develop. The group said that nearly 80 percent of the loans reviewed there were modified or restructured in the first six months of that program.
 Mr. Hook said that Acorn had asked Mr. Paterson's office to review the Philadelphia program, and that it had agreed to do so. 
 Jean-Andre Sassine, 43, a New York Acorn leader who attended the news conference, said he would have benefited from a settlement conference with his bank. Mr. Sassine, a homeowner in Queens Village who also owns a film production company, said he was behind on his $1,600-a-month mortgage and was at risk of foreclosure because of medical bills for his wife and a dropoff in business during the recession. 
 ''I'm playing phone tag with people in Ohio right now,'' he said of his bank.

HEADLINE: In Ex-Convicts' Bomb Case, Steps and Missteps, on Tape

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WILSON; Reporting was contributed by Al Baker, Jack Begg, Sewell Chan, Kareem Fahim, Kevin Flynn, Mick Meenan, Colin Moynihan, Kenny Porpora, William K. Rashbaum, Sam Roberts, Nate Schweber, Kirk Semple, Mathew R. Warren, Carolyn Wilder and Karen Zraick

DATELINE: They were four ex-convicts 

 BODY:
one a crack addict, another whose most recent arrest involved snatching purses -- and they gathered their terror tools as they went.
 They bought cellphones, the authorities said; they bought a camera in a Wal-Mart to take photographs of the synagogues in New York City that they wanted to blow up. When their attempt to buy guns in Newburgh, N.Y., fell through -- their gun dealer told them she had sold out -- they drove downstate, buying a $700 pistol from a Bloods gang leader in Brooklyn.
 After months of planning, the authorities allege, the men had their first real scare this month, driving to Stamford, Conn., to pick up a surface-to-air missile that was waiting for them in a warehouse. One of the men in the car believed they were being followed by law enforcement, so they returned to Newburgh, drove around until they were satisfied they were in the clear, then went back to Stamford for their missile and bombs. 
 They brought them back to Newburgh, locked them in a storage container, and celebrated, shouting, ''Allah akbar!'' 
 These details as told by the authorities describe a homegrown terror plot to bomb two synagogues in the Bronx and shoot down a military aircraft in Newburgh. The outlines of the plan were fleshed out on Thursday, in court hearings, documents and interviews, as were bits and pieces of the checkered life stories of the four men charged in the plot.
 Remarkably, vast passages of the conspiracy the federal authorities described -- the talk of killing Jews, the testing of the men's would-be weaponry -- played out on a veritable soundstage of hidden cameras and secret microphones, and involved material provided by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. A house in Newburgh, a storage facility in Stamford, the planting of the would-be bombs in the Bronx neighborhood of Riverdale -- everything was recorded, according to the complaint. 
 ''It's hard to envision a more chilling plot,'' Eric Snyder, an assistant United States attorney, said on Thursday in federal court in Manhattan. ''These are extremely violent men. These are men who eagerly embraced an opportunity'' to ''bring deaths to Jews.''
 On Thursday, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly appeared at the Riverdale Jewish Center, which the F.B.I. identified as one of the targets of the plot. Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Kelly praised the work of the agencies behind the arrests and sought to tamp down any fears of a larger terrorist organization at work. 
 ''Sadly, this is just a reminder that peace is fragile and democracy is fragile and we have to be vigilant all the time,'' said Mr. Bloomberg, who along with Mr. Kelly stressed that the four men had no connection to any international terror groups. ''The good news is that the N.Y.P.D. and F.B.I. prevented what could have been a terrible event in our city.''
 The case is the latest in a series in New York and around the country since Sept. 11, 2001, and sounded familiar in some ways. The investigation, for instance, began with the work of a confidential informant, who portrayed himself as an agent of a Pakistani terror organization, and who became a critical member of the men's plot.
 The full nature and extent of the informant's role in facilitating the plot is unknown. In other cases, defense lawyers have sought to portray these informants as engaging in entrapment, suggesting they had, in effect, provoked and fueled the actions of their clients. 
 But where past terror prosecutions have been based mostly on conversations about a planned or imagined attack, this one went further, the authorities alleged: the men went through critical acts in what they believed to be a deadly assault.
 As for the defendants -- James Cromitie, 44; David Williams, 28; Onta Williams, 32, and no apparent relation to David; and Laguerre Payen, 27 -- most of the details that emerged on Thursday stemmed from their criminal pasts.
 David Williams, who lately had grown a beard and taken to reading the Koran on slow nights at a steakhouse job, was described as particularly violent by prosecutors on Thursday. When the plan to buy guns from a woman in Newburgh fell through, it was David Williams who quickly improvised, arranging to buy a gun from a man he described as a ''supreme Blood gang leader'' in Brooklyn, Mr. Snyder said. After buying the gun in the company of the informant, David Williams said he would have shot the gang leader if he were alone with him, and kept his $700. 
 Mr. Payen, described as a nervous, quiet sort who took medication for schizophrenia or a bi-polar disorder, was unemployed and living in squalor in Newburgh. His last arrest, in 2002, was for assault, after he drove around the Rockland County village of Monsey, firing a BB gun out of the window -- striking two teens -- and snatching two purses. A friend who visited Mr. Payen's apartment on Thursday said it contained bottles of urine, and raw chicken on the stovetop.
 Onta Williams had been addicted to cocaine since he was a teenager, according to his lawyer, Sol Lesser, at his sentencing in 2003. Mr. Cromitie has spent 12 years in prison, most recently for selling drugs to undercover officers behind a school. 
 Law enforcement officials initially said the four men were Muslims, but their religious backgrounds remained uncertain Thursday. Mr. Payen reported himself to be Catholic during his 15-month prison sentence that ended in 2005, according to a state corrections official. Mr. Cromitie and Onta Williams both identified themselves as Baptists in prison records, although Mr. Cromitie changed his listed religion to Muslim upon his last two incarcerations; David Williams reported no religious affiliation. 
 The men never served in the same prison together. Three of them regularly lunched together at Danny's Restaurant in Newburgh, chatting over plates of rice and beans, said Danny DeLeon, the owner. 
 Salahuddin Mustafa Muhammad, the imam at the mosque where the authorities say the confidential informant first encountered the men, said none of the men were active in the mosque. An assistant imam, Hamin Rashada, said Mr. Cromitie and Mr. Payen occasionally attended services. 
 Mr. Cromitie was there last June, and he met a stranger. 
 He had no way of knowing that the stranger's path to the mosque began in 2002, when he was arrested on federal charges of identity theft. He was sentenced to five years' probation, and became a confidential informant for the F.B.I. He began showing up at the mosque in Newburgh around 2007, Mr. Muhammad said. 
 The stranger's behavior aroused the imam's suspicions. He invited other worshipers to meals, and spoke of violence and jihad, so the imam said he steered clear of him. 
 ''There was just something fishy about him,'' Mr. Muhammad said. Members ''believed he was a government agent.''
 Mr. Muhammad said members of his congregation told him the man he believed was the informant offered at least one of them a substantial amount of money to join his ''team.'' 
 The informant met Mr. Cromitie, and it quickly appeared that Mr. Cromitie was of a like mind with the apparent radical before him, according to the complaint. Mr. Cromitie said his parents had lived in Afghanistan before he was born and that he was angry at the killing of Muslims there.
 The next month, on July 3, the two men met and discussed the terror organization Jaish-e-Mohammed, based in Pakistan, with which the informant claimed to be involved. Mr. Cromitie told him he wanted to join and ''do jihad,'' according to the complaint. 
 All of this came as a shock to Mr. Cromitie's mother after his arrest on Wednesday. Adele Cromitie, 65, said her son was raised a Christian, and that neither she nor his father, who left the family when Mr. Cromitie was a young child, had lived in Afghanistan. She said Mr. Cromitie visited her, at her apartment in the Castle Hill neighborhood of the Bronx, for the first time in nearly 15 years about three years ago, after getting out of prison, and announced he had converted to Islam. 
 ''When he told me that, I said, 'Get out of here,' '' Ms. Cromitie recalled. 
 About six months ago, Mr. DeLeon, the restaurant owner, noticed that a new man was showing up for lunch. He was about 50 and appeared to be South Asian, and he usually paid for the group. Mr. DeLeon thought he was the boss.
 Beginning in October, the informant began meeting Mr. Cromitie at a home in Newburgh that was wired with hidden cameras and microphones, the criminal complaint said. David Williams, Onta Williams and Mr. Payen attended these meetings, and the group discussed Mr. Cromitie's desire to strike a synagogue in the Bronx and military aircraft at the Air National Guard base in Newburgh, according to the complaint.
 In December, the plan began to take shape in the Newburgh house. On Dec. 5, Mr. Cromitie asked the informant whether he could acquire ''rockets'' and ''devices'' for attacks, and the informant said he could provide C-4 plastic explosives to fashion improvised bombs. On Dec. 17, Mr. Cromitie said he wanted to case the air base later that week, and that he would remove his traditional Muslim attire -- a white jalabiya and cap -- so as not to draw suspicion. David Williams suggested they refer to the synagogues as ''joints.'' 
 On April 10, Mr. Cromitie, David Williams and the informant drove to a Wal-Mart in Newburgh and bought a camera, and then went to the Bronx, where Mr. Cromitie took pictures of synagogues. He said blowing up the Riverdale Jewish Center would be ''a piece of cake.''
 Several days later, the three men met again and discussed picking up a Stinger heat-seeking missile in Connecticut and synchronizing the aircraft strike and the bombings.
 On the night of April 28, after figuring out where they could get a gun, the men reinforced their commitment to the plan to one another, according to the authorities. They each said they were willing to perform jihad, and Onta Williams spoke, saying the military is ''killing Muslim brothers and sisters in Muslim countries, so if we kill them here with I.E.D.'s and Stingers, it is equal,'' according to the complaint.
 On May 6, the five men drove to Stamford to pick up the explosives and the Stinger, according to the complaint. The location was carefully chosen in advance, but not by any of the men in the vehicle. 
 The Stamford police were approached by the F.B.I. several months ago, officials said, and asked for help in finding a warehouse where a meeting with the suspected terror cell could take place. A warehouse on the Waterside section of town was chosen and wired for video and audio for the meeting.
 The men, after the brief scare about being followed, eventually made it to Stamford. There, they inspected the explosive devices. Each weighed 37 pounds and was inside a canvas bag. None of them, nor the Stinger missile at the warehouse, was operational, having been disabled by the F.B.I. 
 The four men tested one of the detonators for the bombs, which was to be set off with a cellphone, the compliant said. They drove the weapons to Newburgh, locked them in a storage container and celebrated. 
 The five men met at the storage unit to inspect the weapons on May 8. Twelve days later, they drove to the Bronx with the bombs.

HEADLINE: At Xerox, a Transition for the Record Books

BYLINE: By ASHLEE VANCE

 BODY:
After eight years of hard work turning around a company in disarray, Anne M. Mulcahy has managed to make her departure as chief executive of Xerox look effortless. 
 During a shareholders' meeting on Thursday, Ms. Mulcahy revealed that she would retire as chief executive in July but remain chairwoman. Her handpicked successor is Ursula M. Burns, the president of the company. The management change had been predicted for years, making it one of the least tumultuous power changes in Xerox's recent history. 
 ''For the better part of the past decade, she has been at my side helping to turn Xerox around and more importantly transform Xerox for a new era,'' Ms. Mulcahy told the company's shareholders about Ms. Burns. 
 According to Xerox, this is the first time a female chief executive has replaced another female chief executive at a Fortune 500 company. In addition, Ms. Burns is the first African-American woman to run a company this large. Xerox reported revenue of $17.6 billion in 2008. 
 Xerox declined to make either executive available for interviews. 
 Tapped to head Xerox in mid-2001, Ms. Mulcahy took over a lethargic company that had lost ground to Japanese rivals like Canon and Ricoh. Abrupt management changes and a bungled reorganization of the sales force intensified the company's woes to the point that analysts speculated it might have to file for bankruptcy. 
 In addition, Xerox had endured an extensive investigation of its accounting practices by the Securities and Exchange Commission. As the chief executive, Ms. Mulcahy negotiated a settlement that put the accounting issues to rest. 
 Observers credit Ms. Mulcahy with helping Xerox recover by bringing its costs into line and strengthening its products. Xerox has created printers that compete better on cost and size, including the introduction this month of copiers that lower the cost of printing color documents. It has also continued to build services and technology for managing documents within large corporations. 
 ''She has really completed a remarkable turnaround,'' said Shannon Cross, the managing director of Cross Research, an equities research firm. 
 Ms. Mulcahy, 56, has spent 33 years at Xerox, working in roles that spanned sales, marketing and human resources. Ms. Burns, 50, is also a longtime Xerox veteran, having started as an engineering intern in 1980. 
 ''They're both insiders that sort of bleed toner, as it were,'' said Steve Reynolds, an analyst with Lyra Research, which follows the printing and imaging industries.
 As president, Ms. Burns has most recently been overseeing a large swath of Xerox's operations. She has conducted meetings with investors and Wall Street analysts alongside Ms. Mulcahy as well. 
 Given such close ties, it is expected that Xerox will move forward with a similar strategy. 
 ''I don't really see this signaling any kind of change in direction for Xerox,'' Mr. Reynolds said. ''Ursula will continue to execute the things Xerox has put in place for some time.''
 Ms. Burns takes the job as businesses around the globe are reducing their equipment purchases because of the global recession. Last year, as Xerox faced suddenly falling sales, it cut thousands of jobs to lower costs. ''They're in the midst of another major restructuring,'' Ms. Cross said. ''So Ursula has to get through that, but it's nothing new for her. She's been in charge of that effort.''
 Shares of Xerox closed down 8 cents at $6.82 a share.

HEADLINE: A 'Surgical Approach' to Policy, and Its Pitfalls

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER; Nicholas Kulish contributed reporting.

 BODY:
As President Obama defends his national security strategy, he faces a daunting challenge. He must convince the country that it is in safe hands despite warnings to the contrary from the right, and at the same time persuade the skeptical left that it is enough to amend his predecessor's approach rather than abandon it.
 Arguably on the defensive over policy for the first time since taking office, Mr. Obama is gambling that his oratorical powers can reassure the public that bringing terrorism suspects to prisons on American soil will not put the public in danger. 
 At the same time, he must explain and win support for a nuanced set of positions that fall somewhere between George W. Bush and the American Civil Liberties Union.
 Rather than an easily labeled program, Mr. Obama is picking seemingly disparate elements from across the policy continuum -- banning torture and other harsh interrogation techniques but embracing the endless detention of certain terror suspects without trial, closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, but retaining the military commissions held there. 
 ''A surgical approach,'' the president called it in his address on Thursday at the National Archives.
 But surgical approaches are rarely satisfying to those on either end of the political spectrum who tend to dominate political dialogue in Washington, particularly when it comes to an issue as fraught with emotional resonance and moral implications as the struggle against terrorists. 
 In the reductionist debate in Washington, either any sacrifice must be made to win a pitiless war against radicals, or terrorism does not justify any compromise with cherished American values.
 ''Both sides may be sincere in their views, but neither side is right,'' Mr. Obama said. ''The American people are not absolutist, and they don't elect us to impose a rigid ideology on our problems. They know that we need not sacrifice our security for our values, nor sacrifice our values for our security, so long as we approach difficult questions with honesty and care and a dose of common sense.''
 In his rebuttal speech across town, former Vice President Dick Cheney in effect argued that absolutism in the defense of liberty was no vice. 
 ''In the fight against terrorism there is no middle ground, and half measures keep you half-exposed,'' Mr. Cheney said shortly after Mr. Obama's address. ''You cannot keep just some nuclear-armed terrorists out of the United States. Triangulation is a political strategy, not a national security strategy.''
 The debates over Mr. Obama's latest decisions -- to establish a legal basis for holding detainees indefinitely without charge and to withhold photographs of past abuse while reauthorizing military tribunals with greater due process -- have become a proxy for a broader struggle that could shape his presidency. With the economy in dire shape, Mr. Obama would prefer to focus on domestic issues and put the polarizing security-versus-liberty argument of the Bush years behind the country, but it stubbornly persists.
 With Mr. Cheney accusing the president of endangering the country and liberal allies expressing outrage at what they perceive as his betrayal of progressive principles, the White House concluded that it had no choice but to address the matter head-on. 
 Mr. Obama has never lacked confidence in his ability to educate and win over people when it comes to complex and combustible issues, as he tried to do on the issue of race in the campaign last year or on abortion in his commencement address on Sunday at the University of Notre Dame.
 ''The issue skewed off into a lot of different directions in the last couple of weeks,'' David Axelrod, the president's senior adviser, said in an interview. 
 Mr. Axelrod expressed confidence that the public would grasp the new multilayered approach articulated in the speech. ''It was a thoughtful speech that treated the American people like adults,'' he said.
 Yet even as the White House argued that Mr. Obama always recognized the complexity of the issues before him, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Thursday acknowledged some surprise at the difficulties involved. Speaking with reporters at Camp Bondsteel in Kosovo, he described going through portfolios on ''every single detainee'' at the detention center at Guantanamo Bay.
 ''We knew we were inheriting a system that was not functioning,'' Mr. Biden said. ''We knew we were inheriting a system that was causing us great difficulty around the world.'' But he suggested that the administration's approach had been shaped by what it learned after taking office.
 ''It's like opening Pandora's box here,'' Mr. Biden said. ''We don't know what's inside the box. Now we know a lot more than we did in January.''
 Both Mr. Obama and Mr. Cheney used the term ''ad hoc'' to scorn the other party's policy toward terrorism. But the case-by-case approach of the current White House -- officials there describe it as pragmatic -- has generated confusion and disappointment across the political spectrum. While Mr. Obama dismissed concerns among fellow Democrats about ''30-second commercials'' attacking them as weak on terrorism -- ''I get it,'' he said -- the reality is that the debate could replay in harsh fashion in the midterm elections next year.
 James Jay Carafano, a national security expert at the Heritage Foundation, said Mr. Obama risked being left with no supporters on either side for his program. 
 ''The people on the left know there's more in common than not between the Obama policy and the Bush policy,'' he said. ''And the people on the right know there's a credibility problem because there's a gap between what he tells the left and what he's doing.''
 Sarah Mendelson, a scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who led a commission study that urged the closing of Guantanamo, said the fusion of Bush and anti-Bush policies was untenable. ''They're literally trying to combine these paradigms,'' Ms. Mendelson said. ''And that means nobody will be happy.''

HEADLINE: Head of Brokerage Unit Is Leaving Morgan Stanley

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY

 BODY:
Morgan Stanley has dismissed its head of prime brokerage, Stu Hendel, who ran the bank's hedge fund service business since the fall of 2006, people who were briefed on the decision said on Thursday. 
 Mr. Hendel's departure was announced in an internal memorandum.
 The bank has hired Alexander Ehrlich, the head of prime brokerage at UBS, to take over the post, according to the memo.
 Mr. Hendel declined to comment, as did a spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley. The internal memorandum said Mr. Hendel was leaving ''to pursue outside interests.'' 
 The change coincides with the bank's shift in its relationship with hedge funds, which were once a major profit center. Morgan Stanley now says that it plans to serve a smaller number of hedge funds, and several members of its prime brokerage division have left, including the unit's chief financial officer.
 Morgan Stanley ran into problems last fall in part because hedge funds that kept assets at the bank pulled their money out. The bank also alienated some hedge funds when its chief executive, John J. Mack, publicly blamed short-sellers -- investors who bet against stocks -- for the decline in Morgan Stanley's share price. Many of the hedge funds that used Morgan Stanley for their trading used short-selling in their strategies. 
 Soon after Mr. Mack's comments, the government imposed a temporary ban on short-selling. Many hedge funds blamed the ban in part for record losses last year. Mr. Mack said in later interviews that he was not against short-selling.
 Morgan Stanley had ramped up its prime brokerage business in recent years as the hedge fund industry exploded, and the unit had been highly profitable. 
 The bank had also expanded its operations to serve hedge funds that traded in areas other than stocks, and those assets tended to be less liquid. Part of the leverage that investment banks used before the financial crisis was for lending to hedge funds through prime brokerage units. But as firms like Morgan Stanley began working with more hedge funds that traded in less liquid areas, they were essentially borrowing short-term money to fund illiquid trades.
 Mr. Hendel had worked at Morgan Stanley for most of his career, though he left in 2004 for two years to work at Eton Park, a hedge fund in New York.

HEADLINE: Golden State Bailout

BYLINE: By JOE MATHEWS. 
Joe Mathews is a senior fellow at the New America Foundation.

DATELINE: Los Angeles 

 BODY:
 IS California too big to fail?
 That's the question President Obama and Congress will soon face. While many states have severe fiscal problems, the depth and unusual persistence of California's budget problems -- the state has run deficits for most of the decade -- has emptied Sacramento's till. On its current path, California will run short of the cash it needs to pay its bills in late July.
 It's highly unlikely that the state's political leaders will be able to fix the problem themselves. Typically, states build up a cushion of tax revenues in the spring to pay expenses through the fall, when little cash comes in. But enormous drops in tax revenue have left California without the savings to meet even one month's worth of expenses. 
 The other methods of cash management -- transfers to the general budget from other state accounts and short-term borrowing in the credit markets -- are no longer enough to address the problem. California's leaders have drawn so deeply in recent years on the state's hundreds of special funds that there is little cash left to repurpose. 
 And selling short-term notes in the credit markets is difficult because of California's credit rating, the lowest of any state. Even if the state could pay high interest costs, California may require more cash -- more than $20 billion by some estimates -- than it can plausibly acquire in the markets.
 It is true that California's Legislature and governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, could take bold action to conserve cash. But the size of the deficit and the state's governing system make such action next to impossible. A two-thirds vote of the Legislature is required to pass any budget or raise any tax in the state, and compromise has become a dirty word. 
 A legislative deal reached in February to address part of the budget problem came under such fierce attack from the left (for its spending cuts) and from the right (for its tax increases) that voters rejected five of its major components in a special election on Tuesday. The state Republicans, egged on by right-wing talk radio hosts, have started campaigns to recall two Republican lawmakers who voted for the compromise. California is not a patient that can heal itself.
 What to do? Bankruptcy would appear to be out. Federal law authorizes only local governments, not states, to seek bankruptcy protection. Yet in California, irresponsible voices on the right (and a few on the left) have suggested testing the limits of the law and forcing the state to begin to delay or default on its obligations.
 That would be a disaster, not only for California, but also for the country. Financial analysts fear that the failure of California's government could further damage the state's economy (and by extension, the nation's) and shake confidence in the bond markets, making it difficult for cities and counties to borrow and perhaps sending some local governments into real bankruptcy. 
 Others in Sacramento -- including the Assembly speaker, Karen Bass, and the state treasurer, Bill Lockyer -- are investigating the possibility of federal assistance. This could take several forms. The Treasury could offer guarantees on any short-term bonds that California sells to raise cash. Or money from the Troubled Asset Relief Program could be used to backstop such notes. Or Washington could speed up some of the stimulus money earmarked for the state. 
 Each of those ideas, or a combination of the three, offers hope. However, as a condition of any assistance, the federal government should charge the state a fee that includes penalties if it fails to make major changes in its budgeting process. At a minimum, California should be required to submit for federal approval a multiyear plan to meet its obligations and to eliminate its structural deficit. Washington might also require the establishment of a board to oversee state finances. (Federal loan guarantees to New York City in the 1970s provide one model.) 
 There would be fierce resistance to federal aid. Other states may wonder why California deserves special attention -- it's a fair point, and it might be wise for the government to offer similar guarantees to other states in distress. California officials might worry about the loss of sovereignty. And Democrats in the administration and Congress, many of them Californians, may be tempted to help a Democratic state without conditions. 
 But they shouldn't. By attaching strings to any aid, the federal government would give the state its best chance at saving itself. 
 Most important, President Obama should press California's elected officials and its voters -- 61 percent of whom supported him last November -- to make constitutional changes. Among these would be the elimination of the gridlock-creating two-thirds vote for budgets and tax increases, and new curbs on ballot initiatives that mandate spending for popular programs without identifying new tax dollars to pay for them. 
 Federal officials may resist intervening at first, out of misplaced caution. But the combination of the state's size and its dysfunction means that Washington will probably have to intervene sooner or later. There can be no American recovery if California collapses.

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Said to Be Weighing Financial Consumer Agency

BYLINE: By REUTERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Obama administration is considering a new agency to better protect consumers from practices like those that led to the current financial crisis, the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, said on Thursday. 
 Testifying before a House Appropriations subcommittee, Mr. Geithner said a broad set of regulatory change proposals should be ready to unveil soon, and a new entity to protect consumers of financial products could be part of that effort.
 ''We are examining the merits of setting up a new independent commission or agency to help provide stronger rules to protect consumers and better enforcement of those rules,'' he said in response to questions.
 ''We are not at the point yet ... where we've made a judgment on what precise structure or form this should take, how broad its authority should be, how it relates to existing authorities that exist across the agencies now,'' he added.
 Mr. Geithner said government efforts to bolster the financial system were bringing ''immediate stability,'' and it was now time to turn attention to badly needed regulatory reforms to create a system that would be less vulnerable to collapse.
 Lawmakers have shown strong interest in adopting a consumer-oriented approach to rewriting rules for banks and the financial markets. Capitol Hill aides said earlier this week that some type of financial product safety commission was moving to the forefront of fast-moving efforts to overhaul regulation.
 In his testimony, which was intended to focus on the Treasury's operating budget, Mr. Geithner said the administration was seeking to strike ''the delicate balance between intervention and allowing market participants latitude to operate'' as it tried to restore economic growth.
 Asked about the fiscal woes faced by California, the country's largest state economy, Mr. Geithner said the Treasury was not able to tap a $700 billion bailout fund approved by Congress last year to help the state.

HEADLINE: Going to Disney World With High-Tech Style

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
Barack Obama was standing on a riser inside a warehouse here, delivering an inspirational speech about the blessings of freedom, when his left index finger began to twitch uncontrollably, unnerving his aides.
 The nation's 44th president was in obvious distress. At least it looked like him. But with silicone skin and a tangled nest of wires for veins, this Obama was a 21st-century reproduction. 
 More specifically, it was an audio-animatronic representation of the president, as imagined by the Walt Disney Company, and assembled with the direct involvement of the White House staff -- and of Mr. Obama himself. The president supplied not just his measurements, but he also recorded that speech (which was initially drafted by a Disney writer) -- and yet another recitation of the oath of office, this one in Disney high-definition sound. 
 In that Hollywood building here, the life-size, three-dimensional figure was being put through its final tune-up, its chin rising and hands gesturing in response to technicians, in preparation for shipment to the Hall of Presidents exhibit at Disney World in Orlando, Fla. 
 Disney officials declined to say how much it cost to build an Obama. They have cloaked the project with a blanket of secrecy befitting the Secret Service, permitting this reporter to be the only journalist thus far to view the figure up close but allowing only a Disney photographer to take its picture. 
 Mr. Obama has seen renderings of the figure, telling a Disney employee, Pamela Fisher, ''that we had made him better-looking than he was.''
 Mr. Obama is not the first president to send his voice, or inseam, to Disney World; George W. Bush and Bill Clinton were also given speaking roles in the exhibit during their terms and assisted Disney's ''imagineers'' in the creation of their likenesses. But the Obama figure is assuredly the most lifelike of them all.
 The public is to get its first glimpse of ''Robobama,'' as it is known among some handlers, on July 4. The unveiling will be in a Disney World theater, alongside animatronic figures of every other president. As in the past, the program will end with each president nodding or turning toward the audience during a roll call, as if Mount Rushmore had suddenly come alive. 
 ''Young children watch this, and you want them to feel a sense of identification with the president,'' said Doris Kearns Goodwin, a presidential historian, who was recruited by Disney two years ago to write a Hollywood-style treatment about the presidents, which became the basis for a 20-minute documentary made for the exhibit. ''This makes the president someone not so far removed from them.''
 The exhibit opened in the early 1970s under the direct supervision of Walt Disney and has resulted in countless middle school term papers about the presidents. It has been closed since Election Day as it receives the biggest face-lift in its history. 
 The company has much riding on the exhibit, with visitors' spending at Disney World having dipped sharply in the midst of the economic downturn.
 The exhibit will open with the new film, narrated by the actor Morgan Freeman. At a certain point, the Abraham Lincoln figure will rise and speak to the audience, as it always has, but now it will deliver the Gettysburg Address in its entirety.
 ''And this is the first time George Washington will have a speaking role,'' said Kathy Rogers, a senior show producer for Walt Disney Imagineering, the unit that oversees the creative side of the theme parks.
 But the emotional high point is intended to be the introduction of the Obama figure, who will yet again be heard taking the oath.
 Mr. Obama recorded this version on March 4 in the White House Map Room -- the same room where he retook the oath after a minor flub on Inauguration Day -- to accommodate the Disney World theater's new sound system. At that time, Mr. Obama also read aloud a short speech to be delivered by the figure, one that ultimately passed through the computer of Jon Favreau, a presidential speechwriter.
 ''That speech took a village,'' said Ms. Fisher, the senior Disney writer on the project who along with Ms. Rogers traveled to Washington in March to guide the president through his role.
 The Obama figure's closest forefather is not Lincoln but a modern-day Capt. Jack Sparrow. Assisted by Johnny Depp, who played the captain in the ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' movies, Disney recently installed an animatronic version of the Sparrow character in the Orlando theme park.
 The Obama figure is the result of attention to minute details by Disney sculptors, animators, engineers and even anatomists who pored over presidential photographs and video of him and then drew on the latest advances in robotic technology.
 Thus the audio-animatronic Obama purses its lips to pronounce its b's and p's in a way frighteningly evocative of the real one, and raises its hands, open-palmed, while shrugging its shoulders, in a way that can only be described as Obamaesque. Even the president's wedding ring, with its braided design, has been recreated.
 After their work was done with the president, Ms. Fisher and Ms. Rogers said they were given a special tour of the White House.
 For Ms. Fisher, there was a sense of deja vu. She had traveled to the White House on Disney's behalf in 2001 to capture the voice of Mr. Bush. After he had finished his ''take,'' she said, he stiffened his arms and ''started acting like he was an animatronic figure.''
 ''He's got a sense of humor,'' she added.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Friday about the building of an animatronic figure of President Obama for the Hall of Presidents exhibit at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla., referred incorrectly to Walt Disney's role in the exhibit. While he supervised some of the early development, the exhibit did not open in 1971 ''under his direct supervision.'' (He died in 1966.)

HEADLINE: U.S. Jobless Rate Likely to Pass Europe's

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris's blog on finance and economics is at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
FOR many years, unemployment in the United States was lower than in Western Europe, a fact often cited by people who argued that the flexibility inherent in the American system -- it is easier to both hire and fire workers than in many European countries -- produced more jobs.
 That is no longer the case. Unemployment in the United States has risen to European averages, and seems likely to pass them when international data for April is calculated. 
 ''The current economic crisis,'' wrote John Schmitt, Hye Jin Rho and Shawn Fremstad of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a research organization in Washington, ''has turned the case for the U.S. model almost entirely on its head.''
 In March, the American unemployment rate stood at 8.5 percent, the same as the average rate for the first 15 members of the European Union -- the countries that were part of the group before it began to expand into Eastern Europe. 
 Because countries calculate unemployment rates differently, the rates used in the accompanying graph are the harmonized rates calculated by Eurostat, the European Union's statistical agency. Harmonization does not change the American rate, but does affect some other rates.
 Eurostat publishes harmonized rates for the entire European Union and for three countries outside the union, the United States, Japan and Turkey.
 In April, the rate in the United States rose to 8.9 percent. When the European figures are compiled, it seems likely that the American rate will be higher for the first time since Eurostat began compiling the numbers in 1993.
 For men, the unemployment rate in the United States surpassed that of the 15 original European Union countries in December. By March, it was 9.5 percent in the United States, compared with just 7.5 percent for women. The figures for men and women in the 15 European countries, however, are close together, at 8.4 percent and 8.5 percent.
 The tables show how rates compared in various countries in March -- or, in the case of some countries that are slower in compiling numbers, in the latest month available -- and three years earlier, in March 2006, as the American housing boom neared a peak and economic growth was strong. Then, the United States had an unemployment rate of 4.7 percent, lower than all but three of the 15 European Union countries -- Denmark, the Netherlands and Ireland -- and equal to that of a fourth, Luxembourg. 
 As the graphic shows, the March rate for the United States was higher than the rates of 11 of the 15. The exceptions were Portugal, which has the same rate, and Spain, Ireland and France. Eight of the 15 European countries have rates that are lower than three years ago. 
 How did that happen during a worldwide recession? First, it appears that the safety nets in many Western European economies made it easier for people to keep their jobs as the economy declined. In Germany, programs allow companies to get government help in paying workers, for example, keeping them employed. If the recession becomes severe enough and long enough, of course, it could turn out those programs do not so much avoid the pain as defer it.
 Another factor may be the lack of an economic boom in many European countries, which has left them less vulnerable to recession-related cutbacks.
 There is, and always has been, a large variation in economic performance among Western European countries. Even though workers generally have the right to move between countries in the European Union, doing so presents language and cultural hurdles for many. 
 In the United States, there has been more movement of workers from depressed areas to places where the employment outlook is brighter. But the housing crisis appears to be hampering such movement because some workers own homes that are worth far less than the amount they owe on their mortgages.
 Among the 15 European Union countries, the national unemployment rates range from 2.8 percent in the Netherlands to 17.4 percent in Spain. That is a wider spread than the ones among American states, where the rates range from 4.2 percent in North Dakota to 12.6 percent in Michigan.
 Spain and Ireland, two of the highest unemployment countries in Western Europe, suffered housing booms and busts that were comparable to the cycle in the United States. Unemployment is also particularly high now in the Baltic states, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which ran up large trade deficits during the good times and are suffering now that it is much harder for them to borrow money.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 30, 2009

 CORRECTION:
A subheading last Saturday with the Off the Charts column, about jobless rates in the United States and Europe, overstated the effect of the United States' flexibility in hiring and firing workers. While some economists cite statistics showing that such an option does not lead to lower unemployment, the theory has not been proved.

HEADLINE: As Economy Stumbles, the Zamboni Glides On

BYLINE: By JOHN BRANCH

DATELINE: PARAMOUNT, Calif. 

 BODY:
At least one well-known American vehicle manufacturer is rolling out vehicles as usual. But before a Zamboni can take the ice, it hits the pavement on Colorado Avenue. 
 The neighbors are used to it by now, seeing one of the blocky ice-resurfacing machines rumble out of the low-slung Zamboni factory and trudge down the block -- top speed: 9 miles per hour -- toward the corner KFC. It whirls and comes back, is checked for leaks and fitted with studded tires. 
 Then the Zamboni is sent someplace like Dubai or Prague or Milwaukee. A handwritten tag on a string near the ignition tells where. Zamboni may be the most famous name on ice, a pop-culture icon more recognized than any of the four remaining National Hockey League playoff teams, with a moniker more familiar than Crosby or Ovechkin, probably even Gretzky or Lord Stanley, whose trophy goes to the N.H.L. champion. 
 And, in this day, it may be comforting to know that Frank J. Zamboni & Company, still family owned and operated, is not asking for a government bailout. 
 ''Not yet,'' Richard F. Zamboni, 76, the company president and son of the founder, said with an easy smile. ''We go in cycles that don't really go with the economy.''
 In almost every way, Zamboni is a revered model of consistency. Its form, function and sales output -- 200 to 250 of its all-in-one machines are produced each year, the company said -- have barely changed in decades. 
 ''It's kind of weird -- even people that don't know anything about the sport know the Zamboni,'' said Dave Schneider, a founding member of a hockey-themed band called the Zambonis. When the company learned of the band years ago, the musicians pleaded, ''Please don't make us change our name to the Ice-Resurfacing Machines,'' Mr. Schneider said. The name stayed, and a licensing agreement was struck.
 After inventing his machine, Frank J. Zamboni, the son of Italian immigrants, wanted to name his company Paramount Engineering, to give it more credibility. The name was taken.
 Canadians, especially, are surprised to learn that Frank J. Zamboni & Company is not only American but based nowhere near naturally frozen water. The factory sits in the side-street sprawl of south Los Angeles, between Compton and Bellflower, amid other industrial buildings but within a block of homes and strip malls.
 When Zamboni engineers want to do some on-ice testing, a machine is driven several city blocks beneath a skyline of palm trees and fast-food signs, to the Iceland skating rink, where Zamboni became Zamboni in the first place 60 years ago. 
 The original machine sits in a far corner of the rink. 
 ''The one from 60 years ago would still make a halfway decent sheet of ice,'' Mr. Zamboni said. ''Just not as good as the new ones.''
 Moving in slow ovals, the machine scrapes the rutted surface. It gathers the ice shavings and dumps them into an on-board bin using hidden augers. It spreads water with a squeegee to leave a smooth sheen on the ice.
 Charlie Brown once said there are three things in life that people like to stare at: a flowing stream, a crackling fire and a Zamboni clearing the ice.
 Fans at hockey games -- children and the childlike, mostly -- often cheer the Zamboni when it takes the ice. They applaud precision and jeer missed spots. 
 On the television sitcom ''Cheers,'' Carla's hockey-playing husband, Eddie LeBec, died when he was run over by a Zamboni. Sarah Palin said last year that she always wanted to name a son Zamboni. Car and Driver recently test-drove one, finding that ''the vague steering is totally '70s Cadillac.''
 Mr. Zamboni's father, with Frank's brother and a cousin, opened the nearby skating rink in 1940. Frank Zamboni spent much of the next decade building a contraption to smooth the ice and eliminate the time it took crews to scrape, shovel and spray.
 The Model A made its debut in 1949. The rest of the fleet was numbered, in order. Sonja Henie took Nos. 2 and 3 for her ice show. No. 9,056, almost complete, is headed to a rink in Monterrey, Mexico.
 ''It's a small, family-owned business,'' Mr. Zamboni said. ''It's got a name, but it's sure got a small niche in a small industry when you get down to it.'' 
 That is the key to success, according to Ron Pinelli, president of motorintelligence.com.
 ''It enjoys a unique niche in the market,'' he said. ''Your large automakers do not. Their business model is based on consumer products on a high-volume basis.''
 Zambonis are custom-made, not built until the order arrives. The lead time is usually at least six months.
 Richard and Alice Zamboni have been married 56 years, and four of their five children work for the company. A fourth generation has helped, too, and the family still owns the Iceland rink.
 The factory has about 30 employees and produces about 100 machines a year. A second factory, run by Richard Zamboni's son Frank in Brantford, Ontario -- Wayne Gretzky's hometown -- has similar output. Most are part of the 500 series, found in most N.H.L. arenas. Such machines cost at least $75,000 and sometimes hit six figures.
 The company is privately held and declined to disclose financial information. But 200 machines at $75,000 each would be $15 million in annual sales.
 ''Thirty years ago, my dad said: 'Gee, the market's saturated. We're going to run out of customers,' '' Richard Zamboni said. ''I don't know where that saturation point is that my dad was talking about. We're not there yet.''
 Most would-be competitors have come and gone. But one, the Resurfice Corporation, of Elmira, Ontario, said it produces about the same number of machines as Zamboni. The companies are, in effect, the Boeing and Airbus of ice resurfacing. 
 Resurfice is owned and operated by the Schlupp family, with none of the name recognition of its competitor. Don Schlupp, the company's sales and marketing director, says he is used to hearing people call its machines Zambonis.
 ''We refer to it as the Kleenex syndrome,'' he said.
 All the off-hand familiarity makes Zamboni a bit nervous. It has trademarked its name (and the block shape of its machines) but fears the name becoming a lowercase zamboni, suffering the same fate as Aspirin, Escalator, Zipper and other brand names that lost trademark protections.
 The company also asks that Zamboni not be used as a noun (as it has been throughout this article) or a verb. The ice does not get Zambonied, then, and the vehicle is a Zamboni brand ice-resurfacing machine. Good luck with that.

HEADLINE: A Casino Rises in the Place of a Fallen Steel Giant

BYLINE: By STEVE FRIESS

DATELINE: BETHLEHEM, Pa. 

 BODY:
For decades, Georgine Corroda watched from her home across the street as the symbol of the region's pride, the mighty Bethlehem Steel Company, went from an industrial powerhouse to a vacant wasteland.
 By the time the company declared bankruptcy in 2001, the blast furnaces had been cold for nine years, the 20,000-strong work force had largely been dispersed and the property tax base had plummeted, along with values of the homes of Ms. Corroda and her neighbors.
 Yet on Friday, when the elegant $743 million Sands Casino Resort Bethlehem opened atop the site of the gigantic ore pit, Ms. Corroda was among the first in line with an ear-to-ear grin that exuded optimism for the area that has been lacking for some time. 
 ''I told my father before he died that I would be here for opening day,'' said Ms. Corroda, 61, who worked at the plant, as did many other relatives over the 146 years it was in operation. ''I watched the steel go to nothing. Now, it's coming back. The land is coming back. Look at what they're doing here. We've got a casino, Emeril Lagasse's here, come on.''
 Time will tell if the 3,000-slot-machine casino with four restaurants, including Mr. Lagasse's, will reverse the fortunes of this long-depressed area along the picturesque Lehigh River in northeast Pennsylvania. 
 But opening day drew such crowds that the chief lawyer for the owner, Las Vegas Sands, was corralled into duty valet-parking cars, and visitors waited in lines as long as an hour just to sign up for the resort's players club.
 ''I would be euphoric if every slot machine we have all over the world performed as well as what I'm hearing they're doing today,'' said Sheldon Adelson, the company chief executive, in a telephone interview from Las Vegas. ''Even in this economy, people still want to challenge luck.''
 While the Bethlehem effort has always been seen as a revitalization project for the city, in the past year it has also become a bit of one for the battered Sands company.
 The economic downturn and a high debt load have dragged the stock price to below $9 as of Friday, down from the October 2007 high of $148. The company has had to halt construction of a condominium tower in Las Vegas and more than one new hotel-casino in Macao because of tightening credit. 
 Also delayed are a 300-room hotel and a mall in Bethlehem; their frames stand next to the casino. But Mr. Adelson said he expected to be able to restart most of this construction by year's end. 
 ''Early on, you would look at the quarterly reports and the Bethlehem Steel facility would barely get a mention in the overall strategy of the corporation,'' said Bethlehem's mayor, John Callahan. ''Now, it's become clear this facility has become critically important to the survival of the company.'' 
 It is also critically important to the city. The mayor said he expected the casino, the largest in Pennsylvania, to draw more than 4.5 million visitors a year and provide about $9 million to the city's general fund, which this year stands at $55 million. Mr. Callahan sees this as the entertainment part of a redevelopment that also includes plans for an arts center and television station, a museum focused on American industrial history and condos to be built in a former steel plant building. 
 But while opening day may be promising, the resort has significant competition from casinos in the Poconos and Atlantic City, among other places in the general region.
 ''I do think this is quite lovely, but it's not as close to me as the casinos I already go to,'' said Francine Andrews, 55, of Lawrenceville, N.J. ''I might come back, but only for a special occasion.''
 Here in Bethlehem, what delighted people like Ms. Corroda and Rich Fenstermacher, who worked for Bethlehem Steel for 34 years and is now a casino security officer here, were the homages to the company whose product helped build skyscrapers, railroads and military armament for a century. Exposed piping and a turreted ceiling were built to resemble the style of some of the buildings, and brick walls match the look of the structures that housed the factories.
 ''Just walking around in here, they don't even have to pay me,'' gushed Mr. Fenstermacher, 65. ''I mean, this is Bethlehem Steel. Just look around you. You see the lighting that makes it look like dripping metal. The glow in those windows, that's how the windows lit up in the evening. They are preserving a legacy here.''

HEADLINE: Matsuzaka Is Shaky In Return to the Mound

BYLINE: By JACK CURRY

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
Daisuke Matsuzaka has compared his life as a pitcher to the life of a tuna. The fish keeps swimming to obtain oxygen or it would not be able to breathe and would die. Matsuzaka says he has to keep throwing until he retires. At least he did not say that he must keep throwing or he would die.
 For Matsuzaka, the best approach to being a successful pitcher is being a busy pitcher. That is why Matsuzaka throws more often than anyone on the Boston Red Sox. He wants to be busy. Matsuzaka was very busy in March, when he helped Japan win its second straight World Baseball Classic title. 
 But Matsuzaka, who was named the most valuable player in both Classics, almost certainly pushed himself too hard too soon this season. He went 3-0 with a 2.45 earned run average for Japan, but he floundered in his first two starts for the Red Sox before a strained right shoulder put him on the disabled list April 15. Matsuzaka was out for five and a half weeks before returning Friday to start against the Mets.
 ''I pushed it aside,'' Manager Terry Francona said of the likelihood that Matsuzaka's injury was related to his pitching in the W.B.C. ''I don't know about making peace.''
 In Matsuzaka's first start in 38 days, he lasted his typical five innings and showed decent velocity, but he was gone at the end of a 5-3 loss at Fenway Park. Matsuzaka gave up three runs in a 35-pitch third inning, when shortstop Julio Lugo's sluggishness in trying to turn a double play allowed the Mets to add two crucial two-out runs.
 Besides the prolonged third, in which Matsuzaka said he was a ''little bit short on luck,'' the only other hit the Mets had off Matsuzaka was Gary Sheffield's homer in the second. 
 Matsuzaka is too stubborn to be as consistently economical with his repertory as Johan Santana, who pitched seven sturdy innings for the victory. But the Red Sox realize what they have in Matsuzaka, a talented pitcher who can be entertaining and perplexing.
 ''That was encouraging,'' Francona said. ''That doesn't get you a win. But, long term, that looks good.''
 Francona did not hide his annoyance toward the World Baseball Classic, which he says he feels contributed to Matsuzaka's absence. Because Commissioner Bud Selig engineered the creation of the W.B.C. and has promised to admonish team executives who do not embrace the event, it can be a sensitive subject. But Francona repeated his exasperation over how Matsuzaka's shoulder problems appear to have begun while he was with a team other than the Red Sox.
 Francona called it ''pretty cool'' that Matsuzaka cared so deeply about pitching for Japan, but he would probably prefer it if all of his players were anti-Matsuzakas regarding the W.B.C. 
 ''It's a cool idea, but there's a big but,'' Francona said. ''We're getting ready for a long season and our expectations are high. And we try to be so careful in getting our pitchers ready.''
 Boston may never find a way to get around Matsuzaka's passion for representing his country. He has said that he would like to compete in the next W.B.C. in four years. Matsuzaka is still a hero in Japan. The Red Sox spoke about embracing Matsuzaka's Japanese fans when they invested $103.1 million to sign him in December 2006, so they cannot expect him to ignore his roots.
 ''I don't know that I want to just place blame on a tournament or a country,'' Francona said. ''Let's not start something like that.''
 Matsuzaka was 18-3 with a 2.90 E.R.A. last season, finishing fourth in the Cy Young Award voting. Matsuzaka led the American League with 94 walks, but he also led the major leagues by holding opponents to a .211 batting average. Matsuzaka worked 167 2/3 innings in 29 starts, less than six innings per start.
 Even when Matsuzaka is pitching effectively, Francona has learned not to be surprised if he strikes out three straight batters in one inning and walks three straight in the next. Matsuzaka is stubborn and wants batters to swing at specific pitches. If batters are patient, Matsuzaka does not easily give in. That approach can lead to extended counts and truncated outings.
 ''He likes pitching on a big stage,'' Francona said. ''He just loses the plate from time to time.''
 Since joining the Red Sox, Matsuzaka has contributed to a World Series title in 2007 and has settled in behind Josh Beckett and Jon Lester as their No. 3 starter. He was touted as one of the best pitchers in the world when he arrived in Boston. He has been very good, but not remarkable.
 Although Francona was excited to have a very good pitcher back, he was still annoyed that Matsuzaka had missed time. 
 ''Do I sound like I made peace?'' Francona asked. ''Probably not.''

HEADLINE: Dealing With Rejection

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
The calls from Chrysler officials were coming nearly every day, sometimes several times a day, right through the final weeks before the company filed for bankruptcy. And the message, said Robert Archer, who runs three Chrysler dealerships in the Houston area, was simple: Take more cars.
 ''They tell me, 'The only way that we can survive is if you order cars, and Fiat and the government see money coming in,' '' Mr. Archer said. 
 He acquiesced, he said, thinking he was doing his part to save the company. ''I'm a team player and I don't want them to go out of business, so I ordered a ton of cars.''
 Then, a week ago, Chrysler told Mr. Archer, a dealer for three decades, that his three stores were among the 789 dealerships the company was eliminating as of June 9. Mr. Archer had 700 new vehicles and $1.7 million in new parts in stock when the letters arrived.
 Now, Mr. Archer is among 330 dealers, calling themselves the Committee of Chrysler Affected Dealers, who are contesting the company's action. Next week and on June 3, the bankruptcy judge handling Chrysler's case will consider their objections.
 Many of those fighting the hardest are dealers who recently spent huge amounts of money to stay in the company's good graces, who sacrificed their own profits to help keep the company intact or who otherwise thought they had bent over backward to ensure that Chrysler could survive, only to learn that they were the ones who would not.
 ''I'm mad at myself for being duped all these years by them and going along with all of the things they wanted me to do,'' said Homer Cutrubus, a Chrysler dealer in Utah since 1969. ''If I treated my customers like Chrysler treated me, I wouldn't have any business.''
 For years, Chrysler had been urging Mr. Cutrubus and other dealers to combine dealerships with just one or two of the company's brands into ''alpha'' stores selling all three: Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep. It stepped up that pressure in February, he said, and in April he finally agreed to move his Dodge store in Layton, Utah, into a Chrysler-Jeep showroom half a mile away, even though he thought the change made little sense financially and had to be done at his own expense.
 Included in the exhibits filed in bankruptcy court is an e-mail message from a Chrysler official in Denver to Mr. Cutrubus that said the company wanted to keep only one of the four area dealerships, preferably him. It concluded, ''Are you our guy?''
 ''I called them the next day and said, 'Yeah, we've got a deal,' '' Mr. Cutrubus said. Six weeks later, after he already had spent $100,000 making the move, he got the letter cutting all his franchises.
 Chrysler executives this week defended their decision to cut a quarter of its dealers and the process they used to determine which dealers should be eliminated. They said stores were evaluated on a number of factors, including sales, customer satisfaction, location and condition of the dealership. 
 If Chrysler does not streamline its operations and complete the proposed sale of its good assets to the Italian automaker Fiat, ''the stark reality is all 3,181 dealers will face elimination,'' Steven J. Landry, the company's vice president of North American sales and marketing, said in a statement.
 ''It was not an easy decision to ask the court to reject a portion of our dealer contracts, but the reality is Chrysler's viability depends on a vibrant, profitable dealer network,'' Mr. Landry said. ''As presently configured, Chrysler's dealer network does not meet that test.''
 Mr. Landry also argued that the company was ''treating the rejected dealers fairly by assisting in the redistribution of remaining vehicle and parts inventory, paying incentive and warranty payments due.'' But many dealers disagree.
 Chrysler is not buying back any inventory, including the vehicles and parts that dealers say they never wanted and bought only under pressure. And the entire process, which gives them only until June 9 to liquidate everything, is far from fair, they contend.
 The company's actions have bewildered William Coulter, a dealer in Phoenix. Several years ago, Mr. Coulter spent $2.7 million to buy out a competitor because Chrysler wanted him to sell all three of its brands. More recently, he paid $3.5 million for 12 acres of land in a more upscale, fast-growing suburb. Chrysler approved the relocation, but Mr. Coulter had to delay moving because the recession had cut deeply into sales.
 ''All the local people were telling us we had nothing to worry about,'' he said. ''We were pretty confident, having invested all this money. And after making all these investments, I don't have a choice.''
 Chrysler said 89 percent of the dealers being cut sell more used vehicles than new ones and are, therefore, expected to keep selling and servicing used vehicles. It said 44 percent of the dealers being cut also sell a competing manufacturer's vehicles at the same store, something it does not like.
 In Panama City, Fla., Buzz Leonard Chrysler Jeep used to also sell cars from Mazda and Mitsubishi. But the owner, Gerald Spitler, dropped the Mazda franchise a year ago and in February he paid $200,000 to give up Mitsubishi, even though it did decent sales, to show that he was fully committed to Chrysler. Right before Chrysler filed for bankruptcy, he said he tried to help the company by taking on 25 new vehicles, when he needed only 10.
 ''I was told several times that I was doing all the right things and that going forward I was going to be one of their guys,'' Mr. Spitler said. ''I thought I was right on track with them. I thought this was going to be fun.''
 On May 14, Mr. Spitler learned that his efforts were wasted, while the Dodge dealer across the street, which also sells Lincoln, Mercury and Hyundai, would survive. Mr. Spitler plans to keep Buzz Leonard open to sell used vehicles, but he had to lay off 20 of his 45 employees. Banks that he has worked with to finance sales have dropped him because he no longer has a new-car franchise.
 ''It doesn't make any sense,'' he said. ''You can't expect us to unwind businesses we've had for years and years in weeks. They expect us to vanish.''

HEADLINE: He Helped New York

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''L. William Seidman, 88, Who Led F.D.I.C. During Savings and Loan Crisis, Dies'' (obituary, May 14) was an admirable accounting of the many contributions that this great man made to his country. 
 I would like to mention one contribution that was not included. During the 1975 New York City fiscal crisis, it was necessary for me as governor to summon all resources possible to see New York City and New York State through a liquidity and economic crisis that threatened the solvency of our state.
 At the time, President Gerald R. Ford was amenable to providing some level of assistance provided that we were undertaking the appropriate steps to restore sound fiscal practices to our city and state governments.
 It was Bill Seidman who helped craft the federal government's role. He was instrumental in developing the seasonal borrowing program that provided our team with the liquidity and time to institute structural solutions to restoring New York's economy.
 On behalf of all of us who worked diligently to save New York from fiscal and economic collapse, I want to acknowledge Bill Seidman's incredible intellect and energy in the service of our country. Hugh L. Carey New York, May 14, 2009

HEADLINE: California Led in Job Losses in April, Cutting 63,700

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Forty-four states lost jobs in April, led by California, where employers slashed 63,700 positions, as the recession took a further toll on workers.
 Trailing California in over-the-month job losses were Texas, where 39,500 jobs vanished; Michigan, which lost 38,400 jobs; and Ohio, where payrolls fell 25,200, according to a Labor Department report issued Friday. 
 California's unemployment rate was 11 percent last month, fifth-highest in the country. Michigan's jobless rate was the highest at 12.9 percent, followed by Oregon at 12 percent, South Carolina at 11.5 percent and Rhode Island at 11.1 percent.
 As the recession eats into sales and profits, companies have laid off workers and turned to other cost-cutting measures, like holding down hours and freezing or trimming pay.
 Since the recession began in December 2007, the United States has lost a net total of 5.7 million jobs. The nationwide unemployment rate now stands at 8.9 percent, a quarter-century high.
 The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and some economists hope the pace of layoffs will moderate as the recession eases its grip and probably ends later this year.
 But even if employers reduce layoffs, the nationwide unemployment rate is expected to hit double digits by year-end. Employers will not be in any mood to ramp up hiring until they feel confident that any recovery has staying power, economists say.
 In Friday's state report, Arkansas and Montana tied for the biggest over-the-month payroll gains at 1,500 each. They were followed by Florida, where jobs increased by 1,300 --a dose of good news for a state that has been especially hard-hit by fallout from the housing collapse.
 On the hiring front, North Dakota again registered the nation's lowest unemployment rate -- 4 percent. It was followed by Nebraska with a 4.4 percent jobless rate, Wyoming at 4.5 percent and South Dakota with 4.8 percent.
 Layoffs in manufacturing, construction and retail are common threads running through the states with the highest unemployment rates. Other states, including South Carolina, Michigan and Rhode Island, are having difficulty luring new types of companies to help cushion the loss of manufacturing jobs and retraining laid-off factory workers for other kinds of employment.
 Nearly 6.7 million people nationwide are drawing state unemployment insurance, the highest on records dating to 1967, the federal government reported Thursday. The crush has exhausted unemployment funds in California, New York and elsewhere, forcing them to tap the federal government for money to keep paying benefits.

HEADLINE: Trading Fish and Ammunition, States Team Up to Save Money

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

 BODY:
Minnesota was looking for a bargain on the tiniest walleye fish, known as frylings, that the state stocks in some of its lakes. Wisconsin needed more of the longer fingerlings for its fishing lakes. So the neighbors have decided to share fish -- Wisconsin's frylings for Minnesota's fingerlings -- along with hundreds of other items: bullets for the police, menus for prisoners, trucks for bridge inspections and sign language interpreters.
 With governors from opposing political parties and residents who often share only sports rivalries, Minnesota and Wisconsin are being drawn into the unusual alliance by financial circumstance. The sharing, officials in the two states say, could save them $20 million over the next two years.
 Lawmakers in at least nine other states, and countless cities and counties across the country, are also engaged in a kind of barter system, often allowing them to cut the size of government, split their costs and share services. Some of the makeovers might have made sense at any time, but the urgent political will to change -- cut jobs, close offices and give up power -- was absent before the recession. 
 ''What you have is an economy that is forcing people to share,'' said Joseph N. DiVincenzo Jr., the county executive in Essex County, N.J., which (for $4 million a year) began accepting juvenile detainees this spring from neighboring Passaic County, which closed its own facility (to save $10 million a year).
 In St. Louis, Mayor Francis Slay announced last month that he wanted the city to become part of St. Louis County, an idea he had raised before but with a new urgency now. In the two-century-old borough of West Alexander, Pa., residents shocked some elected officials when they voted to dissolve and become part of neighboring Donegal Township to save money. 
 ''Hard to believe they voted for it,'' said Frank Blakemore, who was, until its dissolution this year, the mayor of West Alexander, ''but it took a lot of headaches away from us.'' 
 In Michigan, where as many as 10 prisons may be closed to save money, officials are in talks with other states to keep some of the facilities open by filling them with out-of-state inmates. Among the possibilities, Michigan workers would continue to run the prisons, but they would essentially be extensions of the other states' corrections systems.
 John D. Cherry, Jr., the lieutenant governor of Michigan, said his state had little choice but to rethink the most basic questions about the role of state government and whether its size and shape still matched Michigan's economic base. Should the state, for instance, be regulating the environment if the federal government is already doing that? 
 ''We don't have any easy gimmicks left,'' Mr. Cherry said. ''It really is a matter of making fundamental decisions about what remains and what goes.''
 The deal between Minnesota and Wisconsin grew out of a budget planning session in which Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota, a Republican, and his staff were searching for ways that counties and school districts might share services. ''It just clicked,'' Mr. Pawlenty said, ''that the state, too, should figure out who we could partner with.''
 By last month, it had blossomed into a blow-by-blow, 130-page report on the services they intend to share, like inspecting amusement rides and making license plates (Minnesota inmates may soon be pressing Wisconsin's endangered-species plates). On nearly every front, the two states are considering buying in bulk, sharing computer systems and swapping intelligence about contracts that could be found more cheaply.
 ''We had been talking about it over the years, and we have had some minor collaborations,'' said Gov. James E. Doyle of Wisconsin, a Democrat. ''But with the Wall Street collapse and the effects of that rolled out across the country, it was time for us to really, out of necessity, intensify those talks.''
 Still, some of the efforts to reshape government have faltered or faded away. In some cases, the arrival of federal stimulus money (''spackle,'' in the words of one budget expert, to patch the most immediate cracks in the state budget) seemed to have quieted the calls for wholesale government restructuring. Elsewhere, efforts to make drastic changes were overwhelmed by more immediate fiscal woes.
 In Indiana, Gov. Mitch Daniels, a Republican, called for getting rid of the state's more-than-century-old township system of government, but those politically sensitive plans were quickly left behind, aides to Mr. Daniels said, while state lawmakers struggled to resolve next year's budget and shore up the state's unemployment trust fund, which ran out of money.
 ''It may be that the fiscal crisis will finally move some of these ideas over the finish line,'' said Lori Grange, a senior officer at the Pew Center on the States, a nonpartisan research group, ''but it's also a testament to how tough some of these proposals are that even in this climate they aren't automatic winners.''
 The real question, budget experts say, is how much all this condensing, overhauling and sharing will actually save, an issue that has been little researched. 
 ''The financial crisis has given us an opportunity to think about all of this,'' said Mildred E. Warner, a professor in Cornell University's department of city and regional planning, ''but if you think about it in terms that you're just going to save money, one can't promise that it will.''
 In St. Paul, Jason B. Moeckel, a state fisheries official, is helping to draw up a plan in which Minnesota will share 40,000 walleye fingerlings with Wisconsin each year in exchange for 400,000 frylings. The fish swap could save Wisconsin $10,000 a year, and Minnesota $20,000, Mr. Moeckel estimates, as well as at least $1 million more that Minnesota might otherwise spend building a facility to grow the smaller fish.
 But there are uncertainties. ''You're dealing with a living creature,'' Mr. Moeckel said. ''You're talking about moving fish across state lines.'' 
 He and his colleagues are conducting genetic testing of the fish; introducing a new strain of walleye into a particular region, he said, could compromise their ability to reproduce. There are worries, too, about carrying invasive species or disease between the two states. And the cost of transporting the fish, in cold-water tanks on trucks, must still be assessed. 
 ''We don't want to be saving a few dollars in terms of the growing of the fish,'' Mr. Moeckel said, ''and then burning a lot more fossil fuels in the transportation of the fish.''
