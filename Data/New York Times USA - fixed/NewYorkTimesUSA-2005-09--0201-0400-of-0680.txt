HEADLINE: Build Diversity

BYLINE: By Michael E. Crutcher. 
Michael E. Crutcher, an assistant professor of geography at the University of Kentucky, is working on a book about the Faubourg Treme neighborhood of New Orleans.

DATELINE: Lexington, Ky. 

 BODY:
NEW ORLEANS would have marked this past Labor Day with the 12th anniversary parade of the Black Men of Labor, one of the many neighborhood-based social clubs that carry on the African-American parading tradition known as second-lining. These parades feature brass bands and ''second-liners,'' the people who join the procession, dancing, as it winds through the back streets of the city's neighborhoods.
 This Labor Day, the ubiquitous images from New Orleans were not those of the Black Men of Labor parade but of violent, impoverished African-Americans. Those people at the Superdome and the Convention Center last week, and those trapped in houses or lost forever to the lake, are by and large laborers who work hard to make it day by day. And whether they change the sheets of hotel beds, drive cabs or make po' boys, these people and their forbears have made New Orleans what it is and deserve the right to return. But will the plans to reconstruct the city include them? 
My research focuses on the dynamics of gentrification and displacement in the central New Orleans' neighborhood of Faubourg Treme, and I fear that those patterns will accelerate in the rebuilt city. New Orleans East, for example, built in the 1970's, is stigmatized as a ghetto for its quantity of Section 8 housing and dense apartment complexes. If that area, one of the hardest-hit by the disaster, is largely demolished, affordable housing may well be replaced with high-end housing and businesses. In historic downtown neighborhoods where floodwaters rose no higher than the ground floors, demolition may not be necessary, but renovations could easily more than double each house's value, thereby making housing unaffordable for many returning renters.
 There are geographers who advocate rebuilding and ''densifying'' the old New Orleans that survived along the levees before the huge drainage pumps of A. Baldwin Wood and the New Deal lakefront and highway projects. This plan would allow the sprawling, low-lying sections of New Orleans built in the last century of automobile dependency to be returned to marsh. The resulting new New Orleans, with its replenished marshes, reduced housing area, and network of high-speed mass transit, may be the smarter New Orleans -- but whose New Orleans would it be? 
 If the new New Orleans is to be culturally and demographically anything like its predecessor, affordable and centrally located housing simply must be made available. And that will entail an ugly battle. Because without strict regulation, the politicians, builders and property owners who will be in charge of reconstructing New Orleans seem likely to try to attract the upwardly mobile, forcing poor African-Americans out of their longstanding downtown or in-town communities. 
 One better solution may lie in replicating the city's original development pattern, in which grand houses line the large boulevards and avenues while more modest residences are tucked away on interior and side streets. This arrangement, which may also defuse racial tensions by keeping the races in close proximity, is readily visible in the west New Orleans neighborhoods known as uptown.
 One day in the not-so-distant future, amid the rubble of Hurricane Katrina, the city of New Orleans will hold a jazz funeral. There the city will bid a final farewell to the souls who have been lost and the structures that no longer stand. These places, and the people who populated them, are inseparable from the history and culture they helped produce. After the service the city will take to the streets and symbolically reclaim them from the lake. But it will be New Orleans again only if we can all second-line.

HEADLINE: Looking Beyond Floodwaters and Seeing Red Ink 

BYLINE: By MARK A. STEIN

 BODY:
HURRICANE KATRINA'S effect on the Gulf Coast is distressingly clear. Its damage to the United States economy just started to come into focus this week. The hurricane seems certain to rank as the costliest, if not the deadliest, natural disaster in the nation's history, and economists say that it is likely to affect economic growth, interest rates, insurance premiums, energy costs and taxes throughout the country. 
Slowing growth would be particularly bad news for United Airlines, which said it had finally settled on a plan to emerge from bankruptcy protection -- three years after it went to court to reorganize its finances. A strike by machinists at Boeing, a leading manufacturer and exporter, may also drag on the economy.

COLLATERAL DAMAGE -- As federal authorities began to deliver significant amounts of aid to the Gulf Coast, government officials in Washington began warning that Hurricane Katrina would also wreak havoc with the economy. Rescue, recovery and reconstruction efforts could cause the federal budget deficit to grow by 15 to 20 percent or more this year and may threaten plans to cut taxes further or to make earlier cuts permanent.
 Congress approved another $51.8 billion in federal assistance on Thursday, adding to the $10 billion authorized earlier in the week. More than 400,000 people have already registered for immediate assistance from the government and thousands more were calling each day. Federal officials began to distribute $2,000 debit cards to those needing money for food and shelter.
 Administration officials said the government was spending almost $700 million a day on the hurricane relief effort and the total cost to the federal government alone could be as much as $100 billion -- almost five times the amount Washington sent to New York after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
 The increased spending comes as the storm threatens to slow economic growth, which would reduce tax receipts. Republican leaders in the Senate this week postponed plans to repeal the estate tax; a repeal would benefit the wealthiest 1 percent of households and reduce tax revenue by at least $70 billion a year. 
 The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan adviser to Congress, said the disruption caused by the hurricane and flooding could cost 400,000 jobs and slow economic growth by 0.5 to 1 percentage point. The agency had previously predicted that the economy would grow 3.7 percent this year.

ENERGY PRICES -- Gasoline prices and the cost of other refined oil products began to level off just below their postdisaster peaks as several of the eight major Gulf Coast refineries began preparations to return to service. Still, AAA said the average price of regular gasoline remained above $3 a gallon across the country; that is 67 percent higher than it was a year ago.
 With the summer travel season over, people tend to drive less, but they will not escape high energy prices. Heating oil will probably cost 31 percent more and natural gas costs will jump 24 percent this winter from last year, according to a forecast by the Energy Information Administration. Such increases could contribute to an economic slowdown by leaving people with less money to spend over the holiday season.
 The Energy Department estimates that Americans will spend 18 percent more on energy this year than they did in 2004. An increase of that size would translate into $1.03 trillion, bringing energy spending up to 8.3 percent of the gross domestic product, the highest level since 1987.

PENNIES FOR DOLLARS -- Almost three years after it sought bankruptcy court protection from its creditors, United Airlines filed its plan to resume business as usual. United's creditors originally filed 40,000 claims totaling $3.6 trillion against the airline, but the figure has been whittled in bankruptcy to about $45 billion. Some of its suppliers may get as little as 7 cents for each dollar they are owed by the airline.
 To finance its restructuring plan, which it hopes to institute on Feb. 1, United said that it intended to borrow $2.5 billion. But there was no guarantee that its creditors would approve the plan -- which assumes, among other things, that oil will sell for an average $50 a barrel over the next few years, well below recent levels.
 United had originally hoped to reorganize with federally backed loan guarantees made available after the terrorist attacks, but the agency running the loan program, the Air Transportation Stabilization Board, repeatedly rejected its application. The last denial came in June 2004, when the board said it believed that United could obtain financing in the markets.
 As United moved to exit bankruptcy protection, two other airlines scrambled to avoid having to seek it. Delta Air Lines said it would sell 11 of its jets for $190 million to raise cash and cut some flights to reduce losses. Northwest sought to reopen talks with a machinists' union that struck it on Aug. 20, forcing some flight cancellations and causing many delays.

BOEING STRIKE -- A strike by 18,000 machinists at Boeing is about to enter its second week with little sign of progress toward a resolution.
 Members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers walked off the job when talks with Boeing broke down three months after they began. Boeing offered employees a 5.5 percent wage increase and pension payments of $66 a month for every year of a retired employee's service. Boeing proposed separate packages for its employees in Wichita. 
 The union wants employees in Wichita to get the same package as all others and is seeking greater job security. It is pushing for $80 a month in pension payments and objects to the company's new health care plan, which it says pushes too many costs onto workers. 
 Boeing anticipated selling 320 commercial aircraft this year, which would vault it back into first place ahead of Airbus, its European rival, which has orders for 276 planes. But if the strike continues through the end of this month, it could force Boeing to postpone delivery of 42 airplanes, according to an analysis by The Seattle Times.

HEADLINE: Ex-Columnist Will Not Be Tried for Taping Call

BYLINE: By TERRY AGUAYO

DATELINE: MIAMI, Sept. 9 

 BODY:
A former columnist for The Miami Herald will not be prosecuted for taping a phone conversation with a former politician without his knowledge shortly before the man killed himself, the district attorney said.
 The columnist, Jim DeFede, ''admitted to the unconsented taping and cooperated with law enforcement in explaining his actions,'' the Miami-Dade assistant state attorney, Joseph M. Centorino, wrote.
 While Mr. DeFede, 42, may have violated a Florida law requiring that ''all parties must consent to the recording or disclosure of the contents of any wire, oral or electronic communication,'' prosecutors said he did not tape the conversation with the former politician, Arthur Teele Jr., for his own advantage. 
 Mr. Teele, a former city and county commissioner who had been indicted on federal charges of mail fraud, wire fraud and money laundering, committed suicide in July in The Herald's lobby, shortly after the anguished phone conversation with Mr. DeFede, a friend of 14 years. 
 ''There appears to have been no malicious intent on the part of Mr. DeFede to violate the privacy rights of Mr. Teele, or to utilize the tape for any commercial purpose or to harm or embarrass Mr. Teele,'' Mr. Centorino wrote.
 Mr. DeFede, 42, who chronicled the politics of South Florida, was dismissed by The Herald for secretly taping the conversation. Tom Fiedler, the newspaper's executive editor, said on Friday that he was not reconsidering his decision to fire Mr. DeFede.
 ''The decision to dismiss him was not based upon the legal implications of his actions, but rather the ethical ones,'' Mr. Fiedler said. ''When you secretly tape someone, you are violating a fundamental principle that's important for all journalists.''
 Mr. DeFede, who is unemployed, said he was satisfied with the investigation and could not understand The Herald's refusal to rehire him. ''This report undermines every reason The Herald used for firing me,'' he said. ''Now we know the truth.''

HEADLINE: On Oil Supply, Opinions Aren't Scarce 

BYLINE: By JOSEPH NOCERA

 BODY:
''We're halfway through the hydrocarbon era,'' my old friend T. Boone Pickens has been saying for the last couple of years. You may remember Mr. Pickens as the most famous corporate raider of the 1980's, but he has spent his life in the oil patch. A geologist by training, Mr. Pickens founded Mesa Petroleum at the age of 26 and ran it for the next 40 years. Now, at 77, he works the oil patch in a different way, running a pair of energy-oriented hedge funds in Dallas.
 A folksy line like Mr. Pickens's -- it sticks with you. But I hadn't realized until recently that it also meant Mr. Pickens had taken sides in a surprisingly heated debate. He subscribes to what is being called the peak oil hypothesis, which holds that there simply isn't very much new oil left to be found in the world. As a result, we are currently in the gradual process of draining the more than a trillion barrels of proven reserves that are still in the ground. And when it's gone, it's gone. 
The best-known ''peakist'' these days is Matthew R. Simmons, who runs Simmons & Company, an investment bank and consulting firm in Houston specializing in energy companies. Mr. Simmons's essential belief, he told me recently, is that energy demand is about to exceed supply significantly. And that was pre-Hurricane Katrina -- before the storm damaged refineries, pipelines and offshore rigs all along the Gulf Coast. ''I would argue that we are in a serious energy crisis,'' Mr. Simmons added. He forecasts increasing oil prices.
 There is a second group of forecasters, though, who argue with equal vehemence that the world is not in an energy crisis and it probably won't face one for a very long time. The best-known proponent of this view is Daniel Yergin, author of ''The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money and Power,'' a history of oil that won the 1992 Pulitzer Prize, and the founder of a rather sizable consulting firm, Cambridge Energy Research Associates. 
 ''This is the fifth time that we're supposedly running out of oil,'' Mr. Yergin said. But, he added, each time new technologies made it possible for oil companies to find new sources of oil and extract new oil from old sources. His firm released a survey a few months ago that says from 2004 to 2010, world oil supplies will have increased by as much as 16 million barrels a day, ''outstripping the likely demand increase.'' Most of those who hold this view say that oil prices will eventually drift down.
 DOES it surprise you to learn that when it comes to one of most vital resources known to man, there could be such an incredible divergence of opinion? It sure surprised me. Even some of the oil majors are on opposites sides, with Chevron taking the peakist view, and Exxon Mobil more aligned with the Yergin camp.
 There are three reasons for this lack of consensus. First, because oil is buried underground, it is hard to measure. So basic ''facts'' -- like how much oil remains, and how much can be ultimately extracted -- are as much the product of guesswork as science. Second, the world of oil can be shrouded in secrecy. As an article in The New York Times Magazine recently pointed out, Saudi Arabia, the biggest producer of them all, won't even allow its reserve and production data to be audited.
 Finally, though, the fact that this enormous divergence has developed speaks volumes about the very different way each camp views the world. ''It's the geologists on one side and the economists on the other side,'' was the way the energy analyst Seth Kleinman of PFC Energy in Washington put it recently. That's an overgeneralization, of course, but one that contains plenty of truth. 
 The two sides do agree on one thing: the recent run-up in oil prices, which began well before Hurricane Katrina, has come about because demand for oil has caught up with supply. The enormous burst of economic activity in China, the generally good economic conditions in the United States and the rest of the West -- these and other factors have led to a surge in oil demand.
 ''The world produces about 85 million barrels a day,'' Mr. Pickens said. ''That's where demand is now, too. And I've seen forecasts that demand is going to be higher than that by the end of the year.''
 What's more, Mr. Pickens added, pre-Hurricane Katrina refining capacity was already at the breaking point, which is another point that is pretty unarguable. ''Refineries were operating at 96 percent,'' he said. ''You can't operate anything at 96 percent. It'll start breaking down.''
 That last paragraph, though, encapsulates the world view of the peakists: all the easy deals have been done. One reason refineries are operating at such high capacity is that no new refineries have been built in the United States for some 30 years, which Mr. Simmons believes can be attributed to the shortsightedness of the industry. ''My theory was that if the industry didn't expand like crazy the U.S. would find itself running short of energy.'' It didn't, and we are.
 Even more troubling, the pessimists believe that it is going to be increasingly difficult to replace the oil that we're now using up. ''Let me give you a number that is pretty shocking when you hear it,'' Mr. Pickens said. ''The world uses 30 billion barrels of oil a year. There is no way we're replacing 30 billion barrels of oil. Just a million barrels a day is 1,000 wells producing 1,000 barrels. That's big.'' 
 How do the economists counter the geologists' arguments? They don't deny that it is hard to find new oil. But they believe that whenever tight supplies push up the price of oil, the rising price itself becomes our salvation. For one thing, higher prices temper demand as people begin to change their energy habits. (Mr. Pickens believes this as well.) Surprisingly, this has not yet happened even as gasoline at the pump has more than doubled in the last year or so. But inevitably, there will come a point when it will change behaviors.
 Secondly, they believe higher prices spur innovation. Oil that couldn't be extracted profitably at, say, $15 a barrel, can be enormously profitable at $60 a barrel. In the view of Mr. Yergin and his allies, in fact, this is exactly what has been happening. They point to new oil that is coming out of the Caspian Sea, deepwater drilling in Brazil and the oil sands in northern Alberta as examples. The 16 million barrels a day of new oil Mr. Yergin expects to see by 2010, he told me, ''is predicated on $25-to-$30 oil.'' If oil stays higher than that, then there will be even more investment, and not just in ways to extract oil, but in new refineries and pipelines and other infrastructure.
 If you mention this theory to a hard-core peakist like Mr. Simmons, you'd better be ready for an earful. ''These economists are so smug,'' he said derisively. ''All they talk about is the magic of the free market. They don't seem to understand that this is incredibly capital intensive.'' 
 He pointed to those Canadian oil sands -- where, he said, Shell Canada recently announced it was going to raise its investment to $7.3 billion from $4 billion to produce an additional 100,000 barrels a day. ''Just think about that; $3.3 billion for just 100,000 barrels,'' he said. ''Doesn't that tell you something?''
 Of course the economists can be just as dismissive of the peakists. ''I've gone from disagreeing with them to debunking them,'' scoffed the energy consultant Michael C. Lynch. ''I believe the world will expand the reserve base. If you put a road in the middle of the jungle, that can wind up expanding the resource base.''
 ''By most estimates,'' he added, ''totalglobal resources is eight trillion barrels of oil. They are saying only a small percentage of that is recoverable, and you can't do anything about it. We are saying the amount that is recoverable expands over time.''
 I wish I had the confidence to make my own forecast, but in this case, I don't. What I do know -- what we all know -- is that oil is a finite resource. Surely, the peakists are right about that. What I also know is historically, the economists have generally been right about how the price of oil has wound up fixing the problem. 
 As Gary N. Ross, the chief executive of the PIRA Energy Group, puts it: ''Price is the only thing that matters. The new threshold of price will do its magic on the supply-and-demand side.''
 After all, it always has before. And it will again. Until it doesn't.

HEADLINE: When an Establishment Site Opens Its Doors to a Grass-Roots Festival 

BYLINE: By ERIKA KINETZ

 BODY:
How a grass-roots effort like Dancenow/NYC, a festival of choreographic short takes from emerging, accomplished, gifted and, yes, sometimes witless choreographers, ended up in one of the city's establishment sites for dance is, in part, a lesson in economic change. 
 Before the festival, which opened on Wednesday and ends on Sept. 17, some 130 choreographers, including 14 who are showing work for the first time and at least one septuagenarian, will have presented their work in a drained pool (at the Highbridge Park Playcenter, in Washington Heights), at a bar (Joe's Pub), on church grounds (the Synod House at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine), in an amphitheater (in Marcus Garvey Park) and, for the first time, at Dance Theater Workshop in Chelsea.
The festival, now in its 11th year, has long taken a catholic approach to performance spaces: ''If it can happen, it will happen'' seemed to be the organizing principle of Robin Staff and Tamara Greenfield, the founders. Watching people move, after all, is a peculiar and occasionally enlightening pastime, which can be enjoyed in many settings. 
 Dancenow has used theaters in the past but never one as prestigious as Dance Theater Workshop. It has focused instead on bringing dancers of all ages, levels of accomplishment and competence out of the black box and into the world at large. ''There is something about bringing dance more into our lives, where you can touch it and feel it, as opposed to sitting in a theater,'' Ms. Staff said. ''It invites interest and makes dance more a part of how we live on a daily basis.''
 But as the ways of making dance have changed, so too have the ways of seeing it. Once, budding choreographers joined a dance company for what was, in effect, a choreographic apprenticeship -- and a great way to build relationships with presenters and producers. As the company model has come undone, showcase performances and festivals have become ever more numerous and important.
 These days, said Cathy Edwards, the artistic director of Dance Theater Workshop, showcases like Dancenow, ''are beginning the process of seeding the field for the next 10 years.'' The organnization has long had its own showcase, Fresh Tracks, but the theater's 33-week season does not afford it the come-one-come-all generosity Dancenow enjoys.
 Though Dance Theater Workshop is not presenting Dancenow, it has heavily subsidized the festival, cutting in half its weekly rental fee of $10,000 -- which, Ms. Edwards said, covers only one-third of the theater's operating costs -- and providing free marketing and technical support.
 ''It takes a hardy soul to make dance in this day and age,'' Ms. Edwards said. ''I want that tenacity and idiosyncrasy on stage at D.T.W.'' 
 Dancenow has presented about 700 different choreographers since its inception. Some have flourished. Others have disappeared. Ms. Staff offered early encouragement to, among many others, Aszure Barton, who counts Mikhail Baryshnikov among her supporters.
 ''It's hard to break into the dance scene in New York,'' said Ms. Barton, who is Canadian. ''I moved to New York not knowing anyone and presenting work where I could. It was a blessing I crossed paths with Robin. It opened doors for me.''
 Paul Matteson, who won a 2002 Bessie Award -- the New York dance world's equivalent of a Tony -- made his New York choreographic debut. ''Face Value,'' with Dancenow at the drained Carmine Street pool in the West Village in 1999. (He has since performed his work at SDance Theater Workshop, among other places.)
 ''I was just a manic fool,'' he recalled. ''It was supposed to be this witty kind of thing, where I kept hurting myself. I think the piece before, this woman had stomped on seashells, and everyone was worried I was going to cut my feet up. It felt like a gladiator arena.''
 There is something unnerving and casual about seeing dance performed in the bowl of an empty public pool that cuts to the heart of what -- aside from fueling the food chain of performance sites -- Dancenow has to offer. The strangeness of such situations can help choreographers unlearn the many numbing things they think they should know and allow audiences, even those who have not seen dance before, to come if they're curious and leave if they're bored. 
 The festival has co-opted many sites over the years, including a raft in the Hudson River and a boxing ring, the most promising of which turned out to be a bar.
 Joe's Pub at the Public Theater first showed Dancenow in 2003. That three-day run has grown, this year, into a series of 18 performances that will continue even after the festival proper is over -- a hopeful sign that contemporary dance may be getting less medicinal and more fun. 
 ''People are intimidated by modern and postmodern dance,'' said Bill Bragin, the director of Joe's Pub. ''When you put it in a nightclub context and someone has a cocktail in their hand, some of that intimidation is removed. People are open to seeing work that is just as challenging from an aesthetic viewpoint, but you put them in a comfort zone.'' Other signs of health: Last year, thanks to a $10,000 grant from the Mertz Gilmore Foundation, Dancenow started to pay the choreographers it presents. The honorariums are small -- $100 to $500 -- but spiritually significant. 
 It is best to approach showcases with rose-colored glasses, goodwill and curiosity. The dozen short pieces in Wednesday night's kickoff performance, ''40Up,'' made up a typically mixed bill. 
 Zvi Gotheiner created a lovely, melancholic solo for Dirk Platzek to Shakira's ''No,'' while the duet Heidi Latsky choreographed to the swelling music of ''The Umbrellas of Cherbourg'' paled next to the movie itself. Doug Elkins did some amusing, disjointed noodling to Bjork. In ''Twelve Incantations,'' the choreographer Laurie McLeod's Dance Theater Workshop debut, the dancers Bettina Montano and Antonia Small buried themselves beneath mountains of white tulle and did all sorts of things pretty girls aren't supposed to do. Victoria Marks's 1994 dance film, ''Mothers and Daughters,'' had a creepy, epic sense of truth. Alice Teirstein and Stuart Hodes performed their 1996 duet, ''I Thought You Were Dead.'' Ms. Teirstein is 76. Mr. Hodes is even older. By the end, the audience was clapping along.
 So the labors of love continue, and it doesn't hurt, every once in a while, to throw the doors wide open and take what comes.

HEADLINE: The Necessity of New Orleans 

BYLINE: By DAN MITCHELL

 BODY:
AS horrible as Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath have been, the markets and pundits have concluded that the economic fallout won't be so bad.
 Not so fast, writes George Friedman, chairman of Strategic Forecasting at the company's news-driven, globally oriented Web site (stratfor.com). While the river, the port and the oil infrastructure appear to be basically functional or reparable, that doesn't mean everything's jake.
''During the cold war,'' he writes, ''a macabre topic of discussion among bored graduate students who studied such things was this: If the Soviets could destroy one city with a large nuclear device, which would it be? The usual answers were Washington or New York. For me, the answer was simple: New Orleans.'' 
 After describing how and why New Orleans is and always has been central to the economy -- for reasons that go way beyond the oil industry -- Mr. Friedman writes that while it's good that so much of the infrastructure is intact, the population loss could be devastating.
 ''The physical and business processes of a port cannot occur in a ghost town, and right now, that is what New Orleans is. It is not about the facilities, and it is not about the oil. It is about the loss of a city's population and the paralysis of the largest port in the United States.''
 The cost of rebuilding can't help but affect the economy. But rebuild we must, Mr. Friedman says, even though ''it is a terrible place for a city to be located, but exactly the place where a city must exist.'' 
 ''Geopolitics is the stuff of permanent geographical realities and the way they interact with political life. Geopolitics created New Orleans. Geopolitics caused American presidents to obsess over its safety. And geopolitics will force the city's resurrection, even if it is in the worst imaginable place.''
 MICROECONOMICS -- The financial analyst Stephen D. Simpson, writing for the Motley Fool (fool.com), drills down to the specific effects the hurricane may have. ''There will be far-reaching consequences across the entire economy,'' he writes. ''While the region will someday recover and return to normalcy, it won't happen quickly.''
 Banks and insurance companies will take big hits. But for the latter, much of the risk has been foisted on reinsurance companies, which essentially insure insurance companies. Most of them ''will come through battered and bruised, but still intact,'' he writes.
 After the cleanup, builders and building suppliers could, well, clean up, ''perhaps offering a cushion to the eventual slowdown in new home construction around the country.''
 There is hardly an industry that won't be affected. The Port of New Orleans is the country's largest. It is ''a major thoroughfare for coffee, lumber, cotton, food, and rubber,'' Mr. Simpson writes. It is ''important not only for its docks and cargo-handling capabilities, but also for its storage facilities.''
 He ends on a hopeful note. ''The U.S. has weathered major disasters before, and this will be no exception. Luckily, we have more than ample resources of our own, as well as those pouring in from all over the world, with which to rebuild, and plenty of incentive to do so.''
 HE'S BACK -- Eleven years after the assumptions underlying ''The Bell Curve'' were rejected as bad science by many critics and academics, Charles Murray, one author of the book, has decided that now is the time for a defense on the Web site of Commentary magazine. His inspiration is Lawrence H. Summers, the Harvard University president whose remarks about women's aptitude for math and science caused a stir early this year. Despite the vast differences in what they said, how they said it, and how people reacted, Mr. Murray declares that both he and Mr. Summers are victims of ''Orwellian disinformation.''
 SWEET RELIEF -- It's been a rough couple of weeks. What better time for a nice cup of tea and a sit down? (nicecupofteaandasitdown.com) DAN MITCHELL

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Sees Opportunities Arising From Storm

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Sept. 9 

 BODY:
Republican leaders in Congress and some White House officials see opportunities in Hurricane Katrina to advance longstanding conservative goals like giving students vouchers to pay for private schools, paying churches to help with temporary housing and scaling back business regulation.
 ''There are about a thousand churches right here in Houston, and a lot of them are helping people with housing, but FEMA says they can't reimburse faith-based organizations,'' Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the House majority leader, said, referring to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
 Mr. DeLay, who joined three of President Bush's top economic advisers on a tour of relief efforts near the Houston Astrodome, added that Congress should also allow students displaced by the hurricane to use vouchers to pay for tuition at private schools. Conservatives have championed school vouchers for decades. 
 Those are only some of the ideas being considered by Congressional leaders and White House officials that could serve the dual purpose of helping hurricane victims and pursuing broader social and economic changes that Republicans have long sought.
 The Bush administration has already moved to relax a variety of regulations in areas damaged by the hurricane. Many of the changes are small, like letting people take bigger tax deductions for the miles they drive while doing charitable work. Another change, announced on Friday by Treasury Secretary John W. Snow, will give preference to investment groups from hurricane areas that are seeking tax credits for community development projects. 
 But other changes are more ideological and more controversial. On Thursday, Mr. Bush issued an order that exempts federal contractors working on disaster relief projects from a longstanding federal requirement that they pay workers ''prevailing wages,'' which are usually pegged to union pay rates.
 The exemption strikes at the heart of a requirement that labor unions and Democratic lawmakers have ferociously defended for years.
 ''There are a lot of opportunities to experiment,'' said Mr. Snow, who jointed Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao and Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez in a rapid trip to highlight the administration's hurricane-relief operations.
 Jumping quickly through visits in Houston; Baton Rouge, La.; and Mobile, Ala., Mr. Bush's economic team emphasized the amount and speed of financial assistance being made available to hurricane victims. In Houston, at a tent outside the Astrodome where job-placement services were being offered, the number of job counselors and visitors from Washington greatly outnumbered the number of people seeking help. Thousands of evacuees are staying at the Astrodome, though the number is declining as more people are settled into apartments and other temporary housing. For the moment, administration officials said they were focusing on the immediate job of getting emergency assistance -- shelter, medical care and cash assistance as well as unemployment insurance benefits and Social Security payments -- to the hundreds of thousands of people who have been dislocated.
 In Baton Rouge, officials said they had received 150,000 claims for unemployment benefits and predicted that the number would continue to soar. The Congressional Budget Office predicted this week that 400,000 people would be temporarily jobless as a result of the hurricane.
 But beyond the immediate needs, Republican lawmakers and administration officials are contemplating tax cuts intended to draw companies and workers back to New Orleans, regulatory changes to speed the expansion of oil refineries and scores of smaller changes to improve the recovery.
 Mr. Snow and other administration officials were noncommittal on Friday toward some of the ideas now circulating in Congress, like offering major tax breaks to companies that set up operations in damaged areas.
 But Mr. Snow did announce a change to the Treasury Department's ''new markets'' program, which provides tax credits to selected investment funds involved in community development projects. About $3.5 billion in tax credits are available, and the investment funds are awarded them through a competitive process on the basis of their proposals. 
 Mr. Snow said the program would now give special preference to projects in areas affected by the hurricane.

HEADLINE: Vietnamese Shrimpers in the Gulf Become Refugees Again 

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER; Campbell Robertson contributed reporting from Bayou La Batre, Ala., for this article, and Jeremy Alford from Baton Rouge, La.

DATELINE: GULFPORT, Miss., Sept. 9 

 BODY:
As the hurricane raged, Hiep Le pushed with all his might against the cabin door on his father's shrimp boat for hours, trying to keep the wind and water out, and watched as his uncle's boat split in two right next to him. 
 The roiling waters picked up the trawler carrying Le Nguyen, who is five months pregnant, and tossed it onto a high bank.
 And the crew of the Miss Brittney survived by pointing their bow straight into the nearest bank and gunning their engines, desperately racing in place to avoid being thrown into other boats that had sought shelter here in an inland canal.
 When the storm passed, at least seven fishermen were dead in the Industrial Waterway, a canal between Gulfport's bayous and back bays that has long sheltered sailors during storms. 
 Those who survived are still waiting there, in brown waters fouled by sewage and rotten shrimp, their exit to the Gulf of Mexico blocked by sunken boats and a collapsed bridge. They wonder about the future of the already troubled shrimping industry, the livelihood of several thousand Vietnamese families that settled along the Gulf Coast after the Vietnam War. Some worry that the storm could leave them refugees a second time.
 ''Even if we could go out, we probably would catch nothing but logs and pieces of wood,'' said Mr. Le, 26, who was waiting aboard his father's boat on Thursday. ''And even if we were to catch shrimp, there are no factories open to sell it at.''
 If the industry does not rebound soon, some immigrants might be unable to make their boat payments; many are already reeling from the losses at their homes. And language difficulties could make it harder for some to find out about, and get, the temporary help that is available.
 Cam Vo, 34, who rode out the hurricane aboard the Sea Lion with her husband, Dap Dang, and their 5-year-old daughter, Anne, said the storm destroyed their house. 
 ''When we came home, our house was gone, so we are living with our uncle,'' said Ms. Vo, whose husband has been shrimping in Mississippi for 20 years. ''Our car is gone, too. We don't know what to do.''
 The Vietnamese began arriving here during the Vietnam War, and came in much larger numbers when it ended. Many who had been fishermen settled along the Gulf Coast so they could ply the one trade they knew. Some found the sultry, sticky Southern climate familiar. 
 Signs of their success are evident here in the Industrial Waterway, where shrimp boats with names like the ''Patty Ann'' and the ''Miss Angela'' are moored next to boats with names like ''Capt. Hiep Phu III'' and ''Viet Pride.''
 The concerns of shrimpers here were echoed across the Gulf Coast, from Louisiana, where the Department of Wildlife and Fisheries estimates that the fishing industry's losses could blow a $1.6 billion hole in the state's economy over the next year, to small towns like Bayou La Batre, Ala., whose economy centers on the seafood industry.
 Shrimping has always been a hard life, but it has been especially hard in recent years. Rising diesel fuel prices and cheap farm-raised shrimp from Asia have taken a toll. Fishermen say things were just beginning to get better this year after the Unites States began imposing tariffs on many Asian imports.
 ''Some of these people were hurting,'' said Henry Barnes, a city councilman in Bayou La Batre. ''Now they're ruined.''
 Here in Gulfport, more than a hundred members of the crews of the shrimp boats, mostly Vietnamese immigrants, stayed with their boats, even as conditions on the canal worsened and the smell grew riper. Some were hoping the path to the sea would soon be cleared. Others said that their boats were all they had, or that they had been told by their captains to stay with the boats. The Coast Guard began running missions through the canal to get food and water to the stranded shrimpers. And while many shrimpers have left, quite a few remain on their boats.
 ''Do you need some water?'' Chad Eberhart, a machinery technician third class, shouted as a Coast Guard Boston Whaler navigated sunken boats to get to the trawler where Ms. Nguyen, the pregnant woman, and her husband, Cho, sought shelter after their boat was tossed onto the bank, where it still hangs precariously. ''How's the baby?''
 ''Good,'' Ms. Nguyen said, patting her belly and signaling that she was carrying twins. She and her husband gladly accepted bottles of water and meals-ready-to-eat from the Coast Guard, and said they hoped to have their boat re-floated next week.
 Paul Cormier, a boatswain's mate first class, pointed to tall pines that line the canal. The bark was rubbed off the trunks in spots 15 to 20 feet high by the hulls of shrimp boats that were lifted during the storm. ''Can you imagine it?'' Mr. Cormier asked. ''Can you imagine what it must have been like?'' 
 Farther down the canal, Mr. Le recounted the struggle he and his father had as they rode out the hurricane on their boat, which was tethered to his uncle's boat and a third boat during the storm. They worked to keep the power on, and the pumps working, as they were rocked by wind and waves. Then they were smashed into his uncle's boat and ripped it in two; his uncle was able to climb aboard his boat.
 ''I could tell my dad was scared,'' Mr. Le said. ''He probably wouldn't admit it.''

HEADLINE: Weiner, Who Once Imagined a Resurgence, Now Has One 

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

 BODY:
When Anthony D. Weiner thinks about the future, he occasionally dwells on the past -- 1977, to be specific, when Edward I. Koch was in last place against a crowded field of better-known Democratic mayoral candidates, only to surge ahead in the primary's final days, beat Mario Cuomo in a runoff and then beat him again to become the city's 105th mayor.
 ''We have a certain affinity in this city for late-charging candidates in the primary,'' Mr. Weiner said in an interview a few weeks ago. ''They have a particular affinity for Brooklyn and Queens congressmen who are appealing to working-class New Yorkers and those who aspire to get into the middle class.'' 
When he said it, that seemed like just another instance of Mr. Weiner's trademark bravado. But now, as Mr. Weiner enters the final weekend of campaigning, it looks more like prescience.
 After weeks pounding the pavement, hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of campaign ads and a couple of strong debate performances, he has marched steadily up in public opinion polls. A Marist survey released yesterday shows him with a 30 percent share of likely Democratic voters, a statistical tie with Fernando Ferrer, who has consistently led most polls, giving Mr. Weiner his highest numbers yet in any poll.
 ''In every race I've been in, I've always been an underdog who's been outspent and had political organizations lined up against me,'' Mr. Weiner said yesterday while campaigning in Hell's Kitchen, one of his few stops in Manhattan over several straight days of campaigning. (He was accompanied by James R. McManus, a Democratic district leader and founder of the local McManus Democratic Association -- at least one political organization that has lined up with Mr. Weiner, not against him.) ''So to some degree, when I was at 6 percent, in fourth place, I had them right where I wanted them. But there's a lot of work to be done here. We still have several months to go.''
 For the last four days, Mr. Weiner has crisscrossed the city by school bus, hitting areas including Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn, Forest Hills in Queens and Riverdale in the Bronx. They are central to the campaign strategy he has pursued from the beginning of this campaign: drawing high turnout in his Congressional district and among other pockets of middle-class white voters, especially those middle-class whites who might best be termed ''Giuliani Democrats.'' At yeshivas and parochial schools, pizzerias and ice cream shops, Mr. Weiner has continued to talk up his central campaign themes: lowering taxes on the middle class, aiding small businesses and promoting governmental ties to religious institutions.
 On Wednesday Mr. Weiner stopped his campaign bus across the street from the volunteer firehouse in Broad Channel, Queens, outside a Roman Catholic school that he said he had helped keep open.
 ''As mayor, I'll not just concentrate on the big skyscrapers of Manhattan,'' he said, a poke at Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and a reaffirmation of his own outer-borough bona fides, much brandished by the candidate as he looks to offset City Council Speaker Gifford Miller's presumed advantage in Manhattan. 
 But there have been a few tweaks to the routine. With recent polls showing him nipping at Fernando Ferrer's heels, Mr. Weiner has scaled back the self-deprecating cracks about his skinny frame and has adopted a more statesmanlike pose, part of a broader conversion from scrappy underdog to genuine contender.
 And where his early stump speeches invoked New York's middle class with unerring regularity, he has lately circled back to issues of poverty and chronic unemployment, in what appears to be an effort to scoop up wavering supporters of C. Virginia Fields. (During Thursday night's debate, he pointedly named Ms. Fields when asked which of the other candidates he would most support after himself.)
 But Mr. Weiner still relies on some his usual lines, as when he hands out orange and blue campaign stickers to children and tells their parents, ''If I see that on eBay in two hours, I'll know who to call.'' And he still likes to leaven his paeans to small businesses with a good joke or two.
 ''The Democratic primary is on Tuesday,'' he told a couple having coffee at a shop in Hell's Kitchen. ''Here's a little reminder,'' he added, putting a campaign pamphlet on the table. ''If you don't mind sharing, we're trying to save money on the campaign.''

HEADLINE: A Deepening Gloom About Ground Zero's Future

BYLINE: By NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF

 BODY:
There has been no healing, really. Four years have passed since the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, and the road to recovery at ground zero looks bleaker than ever. A rebuilding effort that was originally cast as a symbolic rising from the ashes has long since turned into a hallucinogenic nightmare: a roller coaster ride of grief, naivete, recriminations, political jockeying and paranoia.
 The Freedom Tower, promoted as an image of the city's resurrection, has been transformed into a stern fortress -- a symbol of a city still in the grip of fear. The World Trade Center memorial has been enveloped by a clutter of memorabilia. 
And the promise that culture would play a life-affirming role has proved false now that Gov. George E. Pataki has warned that freedom of expression at ground zero will be strictly controlled. (''We will not tolerate anything on that site that denigrates America, denigrates New York or freedom, or denigrates the sacrifice and courage that the heroes showed on Sept. 11,'' he has said.) The Freedom Center, the Drawing Center, the performing arts center that would house the tiny Signature Theater Company and Joyce Theater -- all now risk being dumped, either because they are viewed as lacking in sufficient patriotism or because officials were only toying with them in the first place. 
 On this anniversary weekend, it may be time to face up to what few have wanted to acknowledge: that nothing of value can be built at ground zero while the anguish and anxiety remain so fresh -- nor while political and economic forces are eager to exploit those emotions. 
 I was once unwilling to recognize this. Three years ago, when the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation was opening its competition for the design of a master plan for ground zero, I paid a call on an older architect who had spent a lifetime navigating the byzantine planning politics of American cities. At the time, New York was full of anxious hope. A public outcry over the dull uniformity of the original renderings by the architecture firm Beyer Blinder Belle had sent the development corporation back to the drawing boards, and there was a sense that something bold and important might happen.
 The architect, unimpressed, said flatly that the only ground zero project that was not doomed to failure was the transportation hub. Since it was devoid of symbolic importance, he explained, it would not become a political time bomb. The rest? Forget it. 
 I refused to believe him.
 Obviously, his view was prophetic. The only promising design so far is the soaring glass hall of Santiago Calatrava's train station, which may end up as one of the most glorious public spaces to rise in New York since the construction of Grand Central Terminal. By contrast, the rest of Daniel Libeskind's master plan looks eerily like those original Beyer Blinder Belle proposals -- though with more elaborate packaging -- a somber memorial to the dead, neatly parceled off from a sea of corporate towers that could be anywhere.
 This crushing failure results from an assumption that hollow symbols can be equated with democratic values. And it is compounded by a sincere, quintessentially American belief that any problem, no matter how painful or complex, can be solved through good intentions. Architecture's function here is to provide a reassuring gloss of cultural sophistication -- and political cover.
 The architects, of course, have not been entirely innocent. Mr. Libeskind, for one, could have resigned when it became clear that his master plan had been reduced to a few empty gestures. In choosing to stay, he lent credence to the illusion that everything was proceeding normally. The Norwegian firm Snohetta, architects of the Freedom Center, must now confront a similar ethical dilemma: Should it participate in a project where creativity has been so fully eclipsed by politics?
 It's a stubborn situation, justified by those who believe that any development at ground zero is good for the city's economy. If the 10 million square feet of commercial space at ground zero is not rebuilt, the thinking goes, our fragile confidence will be erased, and the terrorists will have won.
 But commercial space is not what is needed at ground zero. The city is building at a frenetic pace. There are plans to transform a strip along 10th Avenue into a canyon of corporate skyscrapers with 24 million square feet of office space. More office development is percolating at the West Side Hudson Yards and the former Con Edison site overlooking the East River.
 The abundance of new development in the city was a bargain chip for Goldman Sachs when it struck its recent deal with the city to stay downtown. When it threatened to abandon a site just across the street from the proposed Freedom Tower for another one in Midtown, the city was forced to cough up hundreds of millions of dollars in incentives and over $1.6 billion in federally backed Liberty bonds.
 This kind of back scratching is likely to become the norm downtown. Luring corporations to one of the world's most tempting terrorist targets is arduous and expensive. And it's a painful reminder of how far we still are from a state of normalcy. Four years after the towers collapsed, the city is still in a collective process of recovery, yet the grains of optimism sprouted elsewhere -- in a newly reopened MoMA, for example, or in plans to transform the High Line viaducts into a lush extended garden. Meanwhile, ground zero remains the physical manifestation of our worst fears. 
 For that reason, the most moving ideas for ground zero have always been those that treated it with the most delicacy -- Norman Foster's slender undulating glass-and-steel towers, gently rising out of a sprawling park; Ellsworth Kelly's soft blanket of green, which eloquently captured the site's need for silence.
 I suppose that Governor Pataki and the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation could regain a measure of credibility by starting to scale back plans for development at the site. They could solicit proposals for an interim plan, say, that offers a more realistic time frame for rebuilding -- not just in economic terms, but in psychic terms as well. The point would be to allow the site's meaning to evolve over time, from a place for grieving to a place where architecture reasserts the value of life. 
 But none of this will be possible without shifting the emphasis back to what is most important at ground zero: the cultural and public spaces that could be emotionally transformative. It would require some patience and humility. Until then, aesthetic judgments are all but irrelevant.

HEADLINE: The Divide Laid Bare by Katrina 

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 In ''The Larger Shame'' (column, Sept. 6), Nicholas D. Kristof notes how Hurricane Katrina has laid bare the usually hidden divide between the poor and the rest of America.
How ironic that the Bush administration, which is so determinedly perverting government into an instrument that fosters social Darwinism -- leaving the poor to fend for themselves when it comes to childhood immunizations, health care for the unemployed and underemployed, or evacuation before an impending disaster -- simultaneously works to undermine the science of evolutionary Darwinism in our schools.
 At first blush, this might seem like ideological inconsistency. More likely, though, is that we are witnessing yet another manifestation of the aggressive self-interest of this president and his associates. Serving the wealthy -- the ''have mores,'' as Mr. Bush has referred to his cohort -- seems to be this government's overriding ideology.

HEADLINE: The Divide Laid Bare by Katrina 

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 The poverty we are witnessing in New Orleans, wrought by governmental policy and highlighted by Hurricane Katrina, is shameful indeed. But the quieter tragedy, not yet unfolding, may be our loss of one of America's most vibrant African-American middle-class communities.
My husband and I lived in New Orleans for five years. That the wealthy live on high ground and the poor on low ground is not entirely accurate. While high ground was developed first, and famously, in the 18th-century French Quarter, virtually all construction since then has been on progressively lower ground. Finally, postwar construction in New Orleans, and newer homes still, are on the lowest ground of all.
 The New Orleans middle class chose to live in newer homes for all the same reasons as the rest of America. But these homes were low, and often as not African-American. The members of the middle class may have escaped with their lives, but when they return, will the economic opportunity to rebuild their community, homes and African-American-owned businesses greet them, or will this community become another diaspora?

HEADLINE: After Escaping Manhattan, Remaining at Work Across the River

BYLINE: By TINA KELLEY

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY, Sept. 9 

 BODY:
The smokers on the promenade of the Morgan Stanley offices here have a clear view across the Hudson River to the unending emptiness where they used to work. 
 ''From an emotional standpoint, it's good to work in New Jersey, because God forbid something happens, I could walk home,'' said Adam DeCicco, a manager with Morgan Stanley, who lives in Hoboken, N.J., and now works in Jersey City after he and his wife escaped from the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001.
 After the attack, Jersey City and other communities in New Jersey initially played host to thousands of relocated workers from the Wall Street area, with Merrill Lynch opening a trading floor at 95 Greene Street here. At lunchtime four years ago, the sidewalks were more crowded than ever. 
 ''You couldn't get into restaurants for lunch; they were packed, with lines out the door,'' said Dan Frohwirth, director of real estate at the Jersey City Economic Development Corporation. ''For a few months there were a lot of people here, but to a large degree that lot of people was temporary.''
 Now, more than 1,600 new jobs in Jersey City can be attributed to relocations because of the terrorist attacks, Mr. Frohwirth said last month. But city officials say that plans by other companies to move or expand here were scaled back or canceled for reasons ranging from the economic downturn to the financial incentives offered to return or remain in New York.
 ''If anything, 9/11 hindered what we wanted to do here, because there was so much political focus to stay in Lower Manhattan,'' Mr. Frohwirth said. ''We didn't want to lure people away from New York City in a crisis. It would've been a little tacky.''
 In the initial surge across the Hudson after the attacks, about 25,300 jobs left New York City, with 19,700 going to New Jersey, said Frank Fernandez, chief economist with the Securities Industry Association, the trade group for about 600 securities firms. 
 But within a year, most of those jobs returned to New York, he said. A few hundred jobs stayed in Princeton and in Hoboken, according to Mr. Fernandez.
 Only a handful of companies relocated to Jersey City solely because of the terrorist attacks, Mr. Frohwirth said, listing ICAP North America with 814 employees, AIG SunAmerica Asset Management Corporation with 147, Mizuho Corporate Bank with 223, TradeWeb LLC with 155, and Fidelity Investments with 336, for a total of 1,675. 
 Even so, Mr. Frohwirth said, ''People suddenly understood that Jersey City was across the river from downtown Manhattan.''
 Hoboken has also gained jobs from companies uprooted by the attack. Barbara Perlmutter, senior vice president for public affairs at Marsh & McLennan Companies, which used to be at the trade center, said 1,160 employees were working at the Waterfront Corporate Center on River Street in Hoboken.
 ''They are beautiful offices, and very accessible,'' she said, adding that the workers ''all like it very much.''
 Andy Mirchel, a broker with ICAP North America, said many of his co-workers had dreaded moving west after the attack. 
 ''Some of us were very reluctant, especially those from Long Island and Westchester,'' said Mr. Mirchel, who lives in West Islip on Long Island. ''The thought of being out of the mainstream Wall Street environment was not very tasty.''
 But Jersey City became a sweeter option once the company began running shuttle buses to and from Pennsylvania Station and Grand Central Terminal, he said. 
 He said he had enjoyed the restaurants, and the convenience of a health club near his office in New Jersey.
 ''It turned out to be very pleasant,'' Mr. Mirchel said. ''We feel like we're still part of the fabric of the industry down here.''
 Even so, he said that after the recent decision by Goldman Sachs to build a $2 billion headquarters near ground zero, many of his co-workers say they would return to Manhattan if they had the chance, to simplify their travel and make for easier gatherings with colleagues still on Wall Street.
 Robert Sumsky, a relocation foreman with Morgan Stanley, said he loved working here, even though his trip from Queens is 15 minutes longer now.
 ''Everybody is kind of looser, and nobody's more important than the next guy,'' he said. 
 He smiled as he recalled the whining when, three months before the 2001 attack, he helped move an office to Jersey City from the trade center. 
 ''They didn't want to come out here,'' Mr. Sumsky said.
 Until Sept. 11. 
 ''That day,'' he added, ''they were hugging their supervisor.''

LUCE, HENRY III.

 BODY:
 LUCE--Henry III. On September 8, 2005, age 80, on Fishers Island, NY, of cardiac arrest. He was the husband of Leila Hadley Luce, the father of Lila Frances Luce, Ph.D., and Henry Christopher Luce, stepfather of Arthur T. Hadley III, M.D., Victoria Smitter Barlow, Matthew Smitter Eliott, D.V.M., and Caroline Smitter Nicholson, Ph.D., and brother of Peter Paul Luce. Born in New York City in 1925, he was the elder son of Time Inc.'s late co-founder and editor-in-chief, Henry Robinson Luce, and the late Lila Hotz Tyng. He served in the United States Navy and graduated from the Brooks School and Yale University. With Time Inc. for thirty years, he was the publisher of Fortune and Time, vice president for corporate planning, and a member of Time Inc.'s and Time Warner's board of directors. He was a trustee of Princeton Theological Seminary, the Center of Theological Inquiry, The College of Wooster, Brooklyn Museum of Art, A Christian Ministry in the National Parks, Eisenhower Exchange Fellowships, NewYork Historical Society, United Board for Christian Higher Education in Asia, Yale-China Association, and a director of the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations. He served as president of the New Museum of Contemporary Art, chairman of the board of China Institute in America, president of The Pilgrims of the U.S., and an elder of the Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church. For forty-seven years, he was a director of the Henry Luce Foundation,serving as president and then as chairman and C.E.O. until 2002. 
Memorial services will be held in New York City and Fishers Island on dates to be announced. $(6$) 
 LUCE--Henry III. The Trustees and staff of The Metropolitan Museum of Art mourn the passing of Henry Luce, who was a devoted friend of this institution and, through the foundation that he led for decades, a generous benefactor. The creation of The Henry R. Luce Center for the Study of American Art was in large part due to his vision and leadership support-and at the time of the 1988 opening he described the new facility, which displays the Museum's complete reserve collection of more 14,000 works of American art, a ''truly significant breakthrough'' and ''the capstone'' of his foundation's support of American art. The Luce Foundation made possible several important exhibitions here as well. His contributions to this museum will always be remembered, and we extend our condolences to the entire family. James R. Houghton, Chairman Philippe de Montebello, Director Emily K. Rafferty, President$(6$) 
 LUCE--Henry III. The Board of Trustees and staff of the New-York Historical Society mourn the loss of our colleague Henry Luce III. Hank joined the New-York Historical Society Board of Trustees in 1990, and was a committed friend to the institution throughout the years. His passion for the Society and its mission and his visionary support for its future played an important role in our current rebirth. The Society's Henry Luce III Center for the Study of American Culture stands as a tribute to his vision and devotion. All of us at the New-York Historical Society will miss him. We express our heartfelt condolences to his wife Leila; daughter Lila Frances; son Christopher; and brother Peter Paul Luce; and to his entire extended family. Nancy Newcomb, Chair, Board of Directors Louise Mirrer President and CEO$(6$) 
 LUCE--Henry III. Time Warner Inc. mourns the passing of Henry Luce III, whose long and distinguished career at Time Inc. culminated in his service as publisher of Time magazine. He was a member of the board of directors of Time Inc. and later of Time Warner. Like his father before him, Hank was motivated by a deep and abiding commitment to the principles of editorial excellence and journalistic independence that make Time Inc. the world's most successful publisher. Hank helped uphold and extend the influence of our journalists and made enduring contributions to the traditions and operations of our company. He will be missed by his friends and colleagues throughout Time Warner. We extend our condolences to his entire family. Dick Parsons and the Time Warner family$(6$) 
 LUCE--Henry III. The directors and staff of the Henry Luce Foundation, Inc. deeply mourn the passing of their longtime colleague who served as chairman and C.E.O from 1990 to 2002, having been president since 1958. We extend our heartfelt sympathies to his wife, Leila Hadley Luce, his brother, Peter Paul Luce, his children, Lila Luce and H. Christopher Luce, and other family members. We salute his spirited leadership, unstinting loyalty, and distinctive contributions to American philanthropy. Margaret Boles Fitzgerald, Chair Michael Gilligan, President$(6$) 
 LUCE -- Henry III. The Trustees and staff of the New Museum of Contemporary Art mourn the loss of Henry Luce III.

HEADLINE: Neigh To Cronies

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
I understand that politicians are wont to put cronies and cupcakes on the payroll.
 I just wish they'd stop putting them on the Homeland Security payroll.
 Can't they stick their pals who failed at business in the Small Business Administration and their tomatoes over at the Oilseeds and Rice Bureau of the Ag Department?
 At least Bill Clinton knew not to stash his sweeties in jobs concerned with keeping the nation safe. Gennifer Flowers said that Mr. Clinton got her a $17,500 job in Arkansas in the state unemployment agency, though she was ranked ninth out of 11 applicants tested. And Monica Lewinsky's thong expertise led her to a job as an assistant to the Pentagon press officer. 
 Gov. James McGreevey of New Jersey had to resign last year after acknowledging that he had elevated his patronage peccadillo, an Israeli poet named Golan Cipel, to be his special assistant on homeland security without even a background check or American citizenship. Mr. Cipel, however, was vastly qualified for his job compared with Michael Brown, who didn't know the difference between a tropical depression and an anxiety attack when President Bush charged him with life-and-death decisions.
 W. trusted Brownie simply because he was a friend of a friend. He was a college buddy of Joe Allbaugh, who worked as W.'s chief of staff when he was Texas governor and as his 2000 presidential campaign manager.
 It sounds more like a Vince Vaughn-Owen Wilson flick than the story of a man who was to be responsible for the fate of the Republic during the biggest natural disaster in our history. Brownie was a failed former lawyer with a degree from a semiaccredited law school, as The New Republic put it, when he moved to Colorado in 1991 to judge horse judges for the Arabian Horse Association. 
 He was put out to pasture under pressure in 2001, leaving him free to join his pal Mr. Allbaugh at an eviscerated FEMA. Mr. Allbaugh decided to leave the top job at FEMA and become a lobbyist with clients like Halliburton when the agency was reorganized under Homeland Security, stripping it of authority. Why not, Mr. Allbaugh thought, just pass this obscure sinecure to his homeboy? 
 Time magazine reported that Brownie's official bio described his only stint in emergency management as ''assistant city manager'' in Edmond, Okla. But a city official told Time that the FEMA chief had been ''an assistant to the city manager,'' which was ''more like an intern.''
 Ever since W. was his father's loyalty enforcer, his political decisions have been shaped more by loyalty than substance or competence. Mr. Bush never did warm up to his first secretary of state because Colin Powell rebuffed appeals to help out in the Tallahassee recount of 2000.
 The breakdown in management and communications was so execrable that the president learned about the 25,000 desperate, trapped people at the New Orleans convention center not from Brownie, who didn't know himself, but from a wire story carried into the Oval Office by an aide on Thursday, 24 hours after the victims had been pleading and crying for help on every channel. (Maybe tomorrow the aide will come in with a wire story, ''No W.M.D. in Iraq.'')
 ''Getting truth on the ground in New Orleans was very difficult,'' a White House aide told The Times's Elisabeth Bumiller. Not if you had a TV.
 As Mexican troops arrived in Texas to help with Katrina refugees, Brownie was recalled to Washington, where he said he wanted to get ''a good Mexican meal and a stiff margarita.'' Yeah, it was hard to get any good etouffee in New Orleans given the E. coli. The president should find that little bullhorn from ground zero, put it right on Brownie's ear and yell at him to get the heck out of there.
 FEMA was a disaster waiting to happen, the minute a disaster struck. As The Washington Post reported Friday, five of the eight top FEMA officials were simply Bush loyalists and political operatives who ''came to their posts with virtually no experience in handling disasters.''
 While many see the hideous rescue failures as disaster apartheid, Barbara Bush and other Republicans have tried to look on the bright side for the victims. The Wall Street Journal reported that Representative Richard Baker of Baton Rouge was overheard telling lobbyists: ''We finally cleaned up public housing in New Orleans. We couldn't do it, but God did.''
 Even those who believe in intelligent design must surely agree that Brownie and Representative Baker weren't part of it.

HEADLINE: New Orleans Executives Plan Revival

BYLINE: By GARY RIVLIN

DATELINE: BATON ROUGE, La., Sept. 9 

 BODY:
The New Orleans business establishment-in-exile has set up a beachhead in a government annex here, across the street from the state Capitol. From here, organizations like the New Orleans Convention and Visitors Bureau have begun to plot the rebirth of the city. 
 In the cramped offices and hallways of this building, called the Capitol Annex, and continuing into the evening at bars and restaurants around Baton Rouge, New Orleans's business leaders and power brokers are concocting big plans, the most important being reopening the French Quarter within 90 days.
Also under discussion are plans to stage a scaled-down Mardi Gras at the end of February and to lobby for one of the 2008 presidential nominating conventions and perhaps the next available Super Bowl. 
 So far, those conversations have been taking place largely without the participation of one central player: the city. ''They're still in emergency mode and not yet thinking strategically,'' said J. Stephen Perry, the chief executive of the New Orleans Convention and Visitors Bureau. ''We're thinking strategically.'' 
 The hurdles are formidable when so much of the city is still flooded and some are predicting it could be six months to a year before New Orleans is once again habitable. But the power brokers are not deterred. 
 For instance, F. Patrick Quinn III, who owns and operates 10 hotels in and around the French Quarter, has set up shop temporarily at the office of a friend and business associate in Baton Rouge so he can make frequent trips to his hotels, where guests -- from journalists to employees of the Federal Emergency Management Agency -- are now staying. 
 Emergency generators have allowed Mr. Quinn to provide limited power to his guests, and he has bused in workers from Texas and Florida. ''We'll be up and running whenever the city is ready,'' Mr. Quinn said.
 Mr. Perry said, ''What people miss, watching the TV and all, is that the core of the city -- the French Quarter, the warehouse district and the central business district -- is dry.'' Power should be restored to the central city within three weeks, he said, and the water and sewer systems will be functional not long after that. Some parts of the city are already getting power. 
 And, of course, it is the French Quarter and nearby areas that draw virtually all the visitors to New Orleans, where tourism is king. The industry brings in some $7 billion to $8 billion a year, according to the convention bureau, with most of that spent in the French Quarter, the central business district and the warehouse district -- precisely those areas that were least affected by the flooding.
 ''We're walking a fine line here,'' said Bill Hines, the managing partner at Jones Walker, a leading New Orleans-based corporate law firm that moved more than 100 of its lawyers into a satellite office here.
 ''People in Baton Rouge are looking at me funny, as if talking about bringing back music, or Mardi Gras, or the arts or football is frivolous when we're in the midst of this kind of human tragedy. But I think New Yorkers can relate,'' said Mr. Hines, a native of New Orleans.
 ''Just as it was important that Broadway not remain in the dark after Sept. 11, it's important that we start thinking about the future despite all the very depressing news around us.'' 
 Alden J. McDonald Jr., chairman of the New Orleans Chamber of Commerce, is more subdued than some of his business brethren. He is chief executive of the Liberty Bank and Trust Company, the third-largest black-owned bank in the United States. Mr. McDonald, who is working out of one of his bank's Baton Rouge branches, said his customer base, unlike those in the tourist business, was hit hard and at least half his branches were badly damaged by water. 
 Yet he, too, is starting to have some of the same conversation. ''We're talking among ourselves, some banking officials, others here in town,'' he said. ''The idea is we should get on the same page so that we're moving in the same direction. I suspect that over the next week to 10 days there'll be a lot more momentum behind these conversations.''
 Mr. McDonald said that on Monday he would be reopening several of his bank's branches in Jefferson Parish.
 The business community, at first scattered throughout Louisiana and nearby states in the week after the storm, sorely needed a central command -- and they fell into one, courtesy of the state's lieutenant governor, Mitchell J. Landrieu, the son of the former mayor, Moon Landrieu, and the brother of Mary L. Landrieu, a Democrat who represents Louisiana in the United States Senate. 
 On the morning the hurricane first hit, Mr. Perry headed north and west to his mother's home in Baton Rouge, with no idea where he would work. Thinking he would be gone for two days at most, he brought only two dress shirts with him.
 By that Thursday, Mr. Landrieu, whom Mr. Perry knew from his days as chief of staff to a former governor, granted him and his organization a small suite of offices down the hall from his own, on the top floor of a handsome, five-story, 1930's-era building. Others also took Mr. Landrieu up on his hospitality.
 Now, when Mr. Perry needs to talk with his counterpart at the New Orleans hotel association, he walks downstairs to the third floor. The mayor's office of economic development is on the second floor. The director of Greater New Orleans Inc., a private development organization that represents many of the city's largest corporations, had called a first-floor conference room home base until moving on Friday to more spacious quarters. 
 On Thursday night, Mr. Perry dined at Gino's, a popular Italian restaurant here thick with well-connected lawyers and other movers and shakers who call New Orleans home. 
 Such conversations are only preliminary, to be sure. It is only in the last few days that most within the business establishment had an operating cellphone or working e-mail address. Besides, more immediate concerns distracted all but the most focused executives in the first week after the storm, like helping displaced workers find a home, to resettling their own families. 
 So it has been just in the last few days that the city's power brokers have started planning the comeback. Mr. Hines, the lawyer, had been busy helping his son, a student at Tulane University, apply to other colleges while helping his wife move to Houston, where his two daughters will attend Catholic school. It was not until midweek, he said, that he received an e-mail message making the rounds of top chief executives suggesting a meeting in either Baton Rouge or Dallas to ''start talking about the future.'' 
 That meeting will take place this weekend in Dallas, where the mayor has temporarily set up base. Yesterday, Mr. Hines and other corporate leaders were making plans to attend.
 ''Things have really started to turn in the last 24 hours,'' said Mr. Hines, when reached by phone at his temporary offices on Thursday. 
 It is in Baton Rouge, a 90-minute drive from New Orleans, that the New Orleans operation of Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold, a Fortune 500 company, has set up temporary headquarters. Baton Rouge is where a large portion of New Orleans's bankers and lawyers have set up shop. And it is where the Marriott Corporation, which operated the most hotel rooms in New Orleans, has set up a 125-employee command center to handle everything from tracking down workers to assessing what needs to be done to reopen its 15 New Orleans-area properties as quickly as possible.
 Fueling the buzz of optimism that has begun to course through Baton Rouge is the growing awareness that the French Quarter, which drives the New Orleans economy, survived with only moderate damage. Eight of Mr. Quinn's 10 properties are in very good shape, he said, and the 2 others suffered only modest damage.
 ''If the French Quarter had gone down, had it been destroyed from an infrastructure perspective, then the foundation for an economic recovery would have been taken out,'' he said. ''Then the people of New Orleans who have gone through this diaspora almost would have no way to go home. There would have been no jobs.''
 Instead, Mr. Perry and others imagine that the French Quarter will be ready for tourists within 90 days, and the city's convention center will be ready to welcome conventiongoers within six months. 
 The French Quarter, he said, could prove ''key to the city's rebirth; with jobs, there'll be money to start rebuilding houses and start rebuilding the communities.''
 Gordon Stevens owns three cafes in the French Quarter called Cafe Beignet. ''I plan on opening up before the first of the year, absolutely,'' Mr. Stevens said. Mr. Stevens also operates a pair of riverboats that, for the time being, are docked in Baton Rouge. 
 Mr. Perry said he is hearing that same confidence from any number of business operators that cater to tourists. 
 ''We will actually be up and functioning before the city is able to receive visitors again,'' he said. The X factor, Mr. Perry and others said, will be the status of the water and sewage systems, and more mundane matters like the availability of worker to do everything from drive cabs to tend bars.
 Mark Drennan, the chief executive of Greater New Orleans Inc., and whose temporary office is in the Capitol Annex, is similarly optimistic. Mr. Drennan and his 20 staff members -- at least those in a position to pitch in -- have started working with the Louisiana Congressional delegation on the outlines of a business reorganization plan for the city. 
 ''We're looking to raise money to hire the most talented consultants and urban planning people out there to help us rebuild,'' Mr. Drennan said.

HEADLINE: A Shameful Proclamation

 BODY:
On Thursday, President Bush issued a proclamation suspending the law that requires employers to pay the locally prevailing wage to construction workers on federally financed projects. The suspension applies to parts of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida. 
 By any standard of human decency, condemning many already poor and now bereft people to subpar wages -- thus perpetuating their poverty -- is unacceptable. It is also bad for the economy. Without the law, called the Davis-Bacon Act, contractors will be able to pay less, but they'll also get less, as lower wages invariably mean lower productivity. 
The ostensible rationale for suspending the law is to reduce taxpayers' costs. Does Mr. Bush really believe it is the will of the American people to deny the prevailing wage to construction workers in New Orleans, Biloxi and other hard-hit areas? Besides, the proclamation doesn't require contractors to pass on the savings they will get by cutting wages from current low levels. Around New Orleans, the prevailing hourly wage for a truck driver working on a levee is $9.04; for an electrician, it's $14.30. 
 Republicans have long been trying to repeal the prevailing wage law on the grounds that the regulations are expensive and bureaucratic; weakening it was even part of the Republican Party platform in 1996 and 2000. Now, in a time of searing need, the party wants to achieve by fiat what it couldn't achieve through the normal democratic process. 
 In a letter this week to Mr. Bush urging him to suspend the law, 35 Republican representatives noted approvingly that Presidents Franklin Roosevelt, Richard Nixon and the elder George Bush had all suspended the law during ''emergencies.'' For the record, Mr. Roosevelt suspended it for two weeks in 1934, to make time to clear up contradictions between it and another law. Mr. Nixon suspended it for six weeks in 1971 as part of his misbegotten attempt to control spiraling inflation. And Mr. Bush did so after Hurricane Andrew in 1992, two weeks before he was defeated by Bill Clinton, who quickly reinstated it after assuming the presidency. 
 If Mr. Bush does not rescind his proclamation voluntarily, Congress should pass a law forcing him to do so.

HEADLINE: Syria Braces for Inquiry In Lebanon Murder Case

BYLINE: By HASSAN M. FATTAH; Katherine Zoepf contributed reporting from Damascus for this article.

DATELINE: DAMASCUS, Syria, Sept. 9 

 BODY:
The senior United Nations investigator in the murder of a former Lebanese prime minister is expected here Monday, a visit that is already roiling the political waters as many here brace for further revelations. 
 In an increasingly tense atmosphere, security guards have become more prevalent and more obvious on the streets of Damascus, and the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, canceled a trip to the United Nations next week.
All this comes amid signs that the investigator, Detlev Mehlis, is looking closely at the Syrian government's possible involvement in the Feb. 14 car-bomb attack on the former prime minister, Rafik Hariri. The explosion, which left 21 dead, set off a public uprising and, ultimately, forced Syria to withdraw its troops from Lebanon. 
 Mr. Mehlis's visit, which follows the arrest of four senior Lebanese generals in connection with the killing, is intended to set the stage for a broader investigation. He is initially expected to interrogate senior Syrian security officials who were based in Lebanon, including Maj. Gen. Rustom Ghazali, former head of Syrian military intelligence in Beirut, as well as several of his associates. But many officials here fear that Mr. Mehlis may also interrogate much higher-level officials. 
 As a possible indication of his timeline, Mr. Mehlis on Friday sought a 40-day extension of his mandate, which was to end next week. 
 Mr. Assad dropped his planned trip to New York for the United Nations session on global poverty after warnings from the Bush administration that he would be isolated. 
 Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Friday that the investigation would be a top item on her agenda when she meets with foreign ministers at the General Assembly. ''We continue to be concerned about the full implementation of the resolutions concerning Lebanon, and that the Mehlis investigation get full support and cooperation from all member states so that he can do his work,'' Ms. Rice said at a news conference in Washington.
 In Damascus, Mr. Mehlis will try to build on information culled from senior Lebanese agents and numerous informants who have stepped forward to provide evidence and testimony in recent weeks, developments which led to the indictments of the four pro-Syrian Lebanese generals. The four suspects, Jamil al-Sayyed, Lebanon's former head of general security; Ali Hajj, former chief of the Lebanese police; Raymond Azar, a former military intelligence chief; and Mustafa Hamdan, the leader of Lebanon's National Guard, have been charged with murder by a Lebanese investigative judge. 
 The arrests and the continuing inquiry are helping to shift the political winds here, as the mood in the country has grown more foreboding. 
 ''A month ago, many thought it's impossible that we would have had anything to do with the assassination,'' said Samir Aita, a political analyst and economic adviser. ''Now, many people have doubts, and that's a major political change.''
 Damascus cafes were full this week and its markets bustled as an eerie sense of normalcy belied the crisis the city might soon face. But in stolen glances and whispered conversations, the city's growing anxiety bubbled to the surface. 
 Government officials have sought to put the best face on Mr. Mehlis's visit, saying that Syria has the most to gain from a full airing of the case. 
 ''We would like to bring out the truth about Syria's role,'' said Buthaina Shaban, a government spokeswoman. ''We believe that both Syria and Lebanon have been targeted in this investigation and hope we can set the record straight.''
 But as the investigation has inched closer to the government, many Syrians are bracing for a likely political storm. In recent weeks, Syrian opposition figures have been warned to refrain from discussing the issue.
 ''The whole country is on its knees waiting for Mehlis,'' said Yassin al-Haj Saleh, an opposition figure and writer. ''But our greatest goal now is to avoid a total catastrophe.''
 What exactly will happen next is a subject of intense debate here. 
 Syrian analysts expect the government to hand over any low-level figures indicted in the investigation. But speculation abounds that Mr. Mehlis may go as far as interrogating Syria's interior minister and others in Mr. Assad's inner circle. That, many say, could link the government directly to the assassination and set off a cascade of problems. 
 The most immediate fear is that the country may face crippling sanctions, much like those imposed on Iraq in 1990. ''Nobody is willing to sacrifice'' for the government, said one prominent analyst, who asked not to be identified for fear of reprisals. ''This is not about Palestine, nor about Iraq. It's about a fundamental defect in the regime that the regime itself has acknowledged.'' 
 No matter what happens, most here believe that Syria is headed for major changes after the investigation is completed. ''We don't know what the change will be or will look like,'' said Abdel Salam Haykal, a magazine publisher and young entrepreneur. ''But Syria will never be the same again.''

HEADLINE: The Case For A Cover-Up

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY. 
E-mail: tierney@nytimes.com

 BODY:
At last there is a light in the darkness. Washington was slow to respond to Katrina's victims, but now Congress has finally sprung into action. It has bravely promised to investigate the situation. 
 Unfortunately, the members haven't figured out exactly how, because Democrats want it to be done by outsiders. They say the Republicans will turn it into a cover-up. But why does that bother the Democrats so much? Shouldn't members of both parties want to cover this up? 
Suppose, for instance, investigators try to find out who had the brilliant idea of putting the Federal Emergency Management Agency inside a new department with an organizational chart modeled on the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture and Food Economy. One Democrat, Hillary Clinton, did question whether FEMA would suffer, but the idea was originally championed by her colleagues, particularly Joe Lieberman.
 Mr. Lieberman joined Mrs. Clinton this week in calling for a ''re-examination'' of FEMA's status, but he was against independence before he was for it. After the Sept. 11 attacks, he helped lead the charge to create the Department of Homeland Security. 
 Republicans first resisted, as the Democratic National Committee pointed out during the presidential campaign last year. Its radio advertisement declared: ''John Kerry fought to establish the Department of Homeland Security. George Bush opposed it for almost a year after 9/11.''
 Or suppose the investigators try to find out why the Army Corps of Engineers didn't protect New Orleans from the flood. Democrats have blamed the Iraq war for diverting money and attention from domestic needs. But that hasn't meant less money for the Corps during the past five years. Overall spending hasn't declined since the Clinton years, and there has been a fairly sharp increase in money for flood-control construction projects in New Orleans. 
 The problem is that the bulk of the Corps's budget goes for projects far less important than preventing floods in New Orleans. And if the investigators want to find who's responsible, they don't have to leave Capitol Hill. 
 Most of the Corps's budget consists of what are lovingly known on appropriations committees as earmarks: money allocated specifically for members' pet projects. Many of these projects flunk the Corps's own cost-benefit analysis or haven't been analyzed at all. Many are jobs that Corps officials don't even consider part of their mission, like building sewage plants, purifying drinking water or maintaining lakeside picnic tables. 
 The Corps is giving grants to improve New York City's drinking water. In Massachusetts, the Corps offers BMX-style bike jumps at a lake near Worcester and runs a theater next to the Cape Cod Canal showing a video of ''Canal Critters.'' 
 In rural Nevada, an area not known for hurricanes or shipping channels, the Corps has been given $20 million for construction projects. When I asked an official why so much was being spent in Nevada, he said that the money was paying for wastewater treatment and mentioned the name of Senator Harry Reid, the Democrat's leader in the Senate.
 ''Senator Reid is a great and good man,'' the Corps official explained, ''and he is on our committee.'' 
 This week Mary Landrieu, the Louisiana Democrat, lambasted Mr. Bush on the Senate floor. ''Everybody anticipated the breach of the levees, Mr. President,'' she said. But she and others from the Louisiana delegation have been shortchanging the levees themselves. As Michael Grunwald reported in The Washington Post, they've diverted large sums to dubious Corps projects aimed at increasing barge traffic, not preventing floods. Ms. Landrieu forced the Corps to redo its calculations when a project to deepen a port flunked its cost-benefit analysis. 
 Would Congressional investigators focus on these pork-barrel projects? I would guess not. My daring prediction is they would make two discoveries. First, that mistakes were made by many people outside Congress. Second, that more money must be spent on flood protection throughout America. 
 A few outside skeptics may suggest letting this money be spent by mayors and governors in flood-prone areas who can lose their jobs if they earmark it for too many boondoggles and allow disasters to occur. But members of Congress would conclude that only they can be trusted to dispense the money. Of course, should there be another flood somewhere, they would be glad to investigate.

HEADLINE: Call Us to Sacrifice

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Katrina's Assault on Washington'' (editorial, Sept. 3):
 The overwhelming scale of the humanitarian, environmental and economic crisis precipitated by Hurricane Katrina throws into sharp relief the challenges that our government and society have preferred to ignore or address piecemeal at best. 
 Inadequate infrastructure maintenance, especially in the cities; wetland destruction and coastline retrenchment; inconsistent and haphazard emergency planning; wrenching correlations among poverty, race and access to disaster relief; unsustainable dependence on fossil fuels: remediation of each of these issues will require national political leadership and long-term financial commitment. 
 Such investments cannot depend on the vagaries of private and local initiative, however welcome. They will demand participation, contribution and yes, sacrifice, from all of us.
 George W. Bush has the second momentous opportunity of his presidency to lead us in such historic efforts. The first was squandered, but re-election brings new imperatives of statesmanship. 
 President Bush, the time is now for all of us to ask what we can do for our country.

HEADLINE: China's President, in Canada, Urges Deepening of Trade Relations

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: TORONTO, Sept. 9 

 BODY:
China's president, Hu Jintao, and Prime Minister Paul Martin spoke Friday of forming a strategic partnership in energy and trade, deepening an economic relationship that is becoming increasingly important to both countries.
 It is the first visit by a Chinese leader to Canada in eight years. Beijing is looking for new sources of energy, and Ottawa is looking to diversify its international markets. 
 After talks on Friday, the two leaders said they had reached agreements to cooperate in nuclear energy research and development, tourism, trade and the environment, and they soft-peddled disagreements on human rights. They also signed an agreement to triple the number of flights between China and Canada to an average of nearly 10 a day.
 ''We both agreed to upgrade the relationship into a strategic partnership,'' President Hu told reporters after the signing ceremony. Prime Minister Martin agreed, saying, ''Never has our relationship been more important than today.''
 China is already Canada's second most important trading partner after the United States, with $26 billion in goods and services exchanged annually. With China hungry for energy to drive its booming economy and expanding cities, there is the potential for continuing expansion.
 The growing Chinese interest in Canada's natural gas, uranium and oil sands was underscored in April when the Canadian company Enbridge signed an agreement with PetroChina to construct a $2.1 billion pipeline from northern Alberta to a Canadian Pacific port, which would ultimately export 400,000 barrels of oil a day. Half would go to China, a fact that did not go unnoticed among American officials.
 China National Petroleum Corporation in April paid $120 million for a 17 percent share of the Calgary-based MEG Energy Corporation to gain a stake in Canada's oil sands, and has offered to pay nearly $4 billion for another Canadian company, PetroKazakhstan Inc.
 The Chinese effort to buy Canadian energy assets has stirred a modest public debate here, but nothing like the controversy that erupted in the United States when China tried to buy an American oil company, Unocal, earlier this year.
 President Hu, who arrived in Canada on Thursday, is visiting Ottawa, Toronto and Niagara Falls. After traveling to Mexico and then to New York for a United Nations special session on global poverty next week, he will fly to Vancouver before returning to China.
 He has brought a large entourage of economic advisers and the governor of the Chinese central bank, with the intention of meeting investors as well as softening China's image here. With one million Chinese immigrants living in Canada, there is natural bridge for trade between the countries. Already 400 Canadian-based companies have a presence in China.
 Human rights have already shadowed the visit. Demonstrators belonging to Falun Gong gathered outside President Hu's hotel, while protesters placed critical signs and banners along his travel routes.
 At the signing ceremony on Friday, Prime Minister Martin pressed Mr. Hu on human rights. ''Given the increasing leadership role that we believe China will play in the world, it's very important that that leadership be accompanied by continual improvements of human rights within China,'' he said.
 President Hu said that China had made great strides in human rights, and played down any disagreement with Canada.
 ''It is quite normal for our two countries to have different views on human rights,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Boeing Acts to Settle 2 Inquiries

BYLINE: By JEFF BAILEY

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Sept. 9 

 BODY:
The Boeing Company is negotiating with federal prosecutors to avoid charges in two separate investigations, expecting to pay a combined $300 million to $500 million, in a move that would allow the company's new chief executive to focus on other challenges, including a week-old strike by 18,000 machinists.
 Booming aircraft orders have pushed Boeing's stock up in recent months to close at $65.40 yesterday, up 81 cents, from about $51 at the beginning of the year. Management, led by a new chief executive, James McNerney, recently raised profit projections. Putting the twin investigations behind it would help Boeing. 
The negotiations, in cases being handled by prosecutors in Los Angeles and in Alexandria, Va., would require Boeing to agree to a deferred prosecution agreement, with actual criminal charges held in abeyance as long as the company lives up to the agreement.
 ''None of this is tied up yet,'' a person with knowledge of the discussions said, asking not to be named for fear of upsetting the talks. ''But these things are all seriously on the table.'' The turn in the negotiations was reported Friday in The Wall Street Journal.
 The first of the two cases involves Boeing employees obtaining confidential documents from the Lockheed Martin Corporation, a competitor on a big military contract. The other case involves Boeing entering into discussions to hire a Pentagon procurement official while she still had some say in contracts Boeing was seeking. The Pentagon official, Darlene Druyun, and Boeing's former chief financial officer, Mike Sears, each received a sentence of less than one year in prison in connection with her hiring.
 During the investigations, Boeing has been barred from seeking some federal contracts. Paul McNulty, the United States Attorney in Alexandria, declined through a spokesman to comment. A Boeing spokesman in Chicago, Tim Neale, declined to comment on the cases. A Lockheed Martin spokesman also declined to comment.
 Mr. McNerney, hired away from 3M in July to be Boeing's chief executive, wants to make the giant's manufacturing operations more productive and profitable, like those at his former employer, General Electric. And clearing away Boeing's legal troubles would allow him to focus on that task as well as help lift a cloud that has hung over the company, especially at the Pentagon.
 Before the strike hit, Boeing had expected to deliver 320 airplanes this year and 395 in 2006. And in July it raised its profit projections for 2005 and 2006. Last year, Boeing had net income of $1.87 billion, or $2.30 a diluted share, on revenue of $52.5 billion. Boeing said in July it expected 2005 per share net income of $2.75 to $2.85 and 2006 results of $3 to $3.20.

OBLIVION: Stories, by David Foster Wallace. (Back Bay/Little, Brown, $14.95.) These eight stories display Foster Wallace's attention to microscopic detail and taste for philosophical conundrums. The first, ''Mister Squishy,'' conjures a marketing whiz whose mind is so packed with arcane abbreviations and case studies that his personality is crowded out. Another story, ''Good Old Neon,'' relates a high-achieving young man's quest to root out his unhappiness.

HARD NEWS: Twenty-One Brutal Months at The New York Times and How They Changed the American Media, by Seth Mnookin. (Random House, $14.95.) Howell Raines's brief, tumultuous tenure as executive editor culminated in the Jayson Blair scandal in the spring of 2003. Mnookin, a former Newsweek media writer, delivers a fly-on-the-wall account of what he calls institutional failure and upheaval at The Times.

A CARNIVORE'S INQUIRY, by Sabina Murray. (Grove Press, $13.) Murray's debut novel is a psychological thriller narrated by Katherine Shea, a young woman obsessed with the notion of cannibalism. With a sharp mind and a morbid imagination, she drifts from New York to Maine, Texas and Mexico, picking up men and then leaving them -- usually dead. ''That we trail after this wolfish character as doggedly as her doomed lovers has to do with Murray's mesmerizing voice,'' Marilyn Stasio wrote in the Book Review.

DYLAN'S VISIONS OF SIN, by Christopher Ricks. (Ecco/HarperCollins, $15.95.) Ricks, the great British literary critic and Oxford professor of poetry, devotes some 500 pages to a close analysis, sometimes line by line, of Bob Dylan's greatest hits. Reading songs like ''Not Dark Yet'' and ''Like a Rolling Stone'' against the seven deadly sins, four cardinal virtues and three heavenly graces, Ricks unveils allusions, teases out intentions and otherwise treats Dylan as he has treated Keats and Tennyson. The author ''has an ear for a tune as well as a trope,'' our reviewer, Jonathan Lethem, wrote.

HOW I PAID FOR COLLEGE: A Novel of Sex, Theft, Friendship and Musical Theater, by Marc Acito. (Broadway, $9.95.) In this witty high school romp set in New Jersey in the 1980's, Edward Zanni wants to study acting at Julliard, but his insensitive father offers business school instead. Luckily, Edward's friends devise a scheme to scrape together his tuition money.

EMPEROR OF JAPAN: Meiji and His World, 1852-1912, by Donald Keene. (Columbia University, $24.95.)

Keene, one of the foremost critics and translators of Japanese culture, constructs a year-by-year biography of the emperor's life and outlines the significant events of the Meiji period (1868-1912).

ALL IN GOOD TIME: A Memoir, by Jonathan Schwartz. (Random House, $13.95.) Schwartz, the stubbornly opinionated Manhattan disc jockey, sketches his career spinning classic pop standards and the plight of growing up in the shadow of a famous father, the composer Arthur Schwartz (1900-84).

INHERITANCE, by Lan Samantha Chang. (Norton, $13.95.) In ''Hunger: A Novella and Stories,'' Chang, the director of the Iowa Writers' Workshop, focused on the tensions in Chinese-American families straddling two countries. ''Inheritance,'' her somber and sweeping first novel, takes place in midcentury China and revolves around two sisters. The older, Junan, flees to Taiwan after the Nationalist defeat, ultimately settling in California as a rich, steely dowager. The younger, idealistic Yinan remains in China. Their bond is ruptured when Yinan falls in love with Junan's husband, a Nationalist officer.

HENRY ADAMS AND THE 
 MAKING OF AMERICA
 By Garry Wills. 
 467 pp. Houghton Mifflin Company. $30.
According to Garry Wills, Henry Adams's ''History of the United States of America During the Administrations of Thomas Jefferson'' and ''History of the United States of America During the Administrations of James Madison'' stand today ''little read, appreciated or studied.'' Wills maintains that Adams's sweeping nine-volume chronicle -- ''the nonfiction prose masterpiece of the 19th century in America'' -- has suffered not only neglect but also the humiliation of being misread by professional historians. Richard Hofstadter, for example, accused Adams of caricaturing America as a ''slack and derivative culture, of fumbling and small-minded statecraft, terrible parochial wrangling and treasonous schemes, climaxed by a ludicrous and unnecessary war.'' 
 Hofstadter's view, Wills counters, is largely derived from his misinterpretation of the first six chapters of the ''History,'' in which Adams produces a sociological portrait of American society and culture in 1800, on the eve of Thomas Jefferson's first administration. These chapters indeed portray America as an uncultured backwater. But Wills argues that Adams intended the opening chapters as a prelude to his historical narrative, and that they foreshadow the optimistic summing up in the final four chapters of the work.
 Those preliminary chapters, in addition to being greatly informative on many aspects of American society -- to me they read like a cross between Tocqueville and John Gunther's ''Inside'' books -- are also charged with the ironic wit and egalitarian democratic faith that animate the remaining volumes. In one passage Adams proclaims that if Americans ''were right in thinking that the next necessity of human progress was to lift the average man upon an intellectual and social level with the most favored, they stood at least three generations nearer than Europe to their common goal.'' Wills shows that Adams saw Jefferson as the early Republic's champion of democracy, unlike Alexander Hamilton, who ''considered democracy a fatal curse.'' Jefferson is thus the (flawed and sometimes accidental) hero of Adams's epic.
 Wills devotes his first six chapters to a learned summary of the state of historiography in Henry Adams's day. He discusses the shaping experiences that prepared this descendant of America's first First Family for the task of writing an innovative, comprehensive history (and one in which the two Presidents Adams receive no favoritism).
 Adams's maiden historical work, a revisionist study of John Smith and Pocahontas, which he researched while in London serving as secretary to his father, the minister to Britain, Charles Francis Adams, impressed on him the importance of working with archival documents and private correspondence. When he started working on the ''History'' in 1879, he traveled to London, Paris, Madrid and other capitals to winnow fresh material from government files.
 Charles Francis Adams's trying negotiations with the British government during our Civil War also gave the son a firsthand insight into the importance of seeing America vis-a-vis other players on the world stage. In the ''History,'' Wills notes, Adams devotes several chapters to the machinations of Napoleon, whom he considers Jefferson's great rival, seeking relentlessly to maneuver America into a war with England.
 In 1812 Madison finally launched a war against Britain. Adams supports the war but judges Jefferson and Madison woefully lax in preparing for it. Both men had on misguided principle opposed any prewar naval buildup and allowed the Army to go to seed. Jefferson persisted in a misconceived embargo of Britain long after it had failed to win its objective. 
 Madison, the intellectual, was a poor administrator who appointed incompetents to lead the Army. Carrying forward Jefferson's policies, he dragged an unwilling, unready nation into a war that started out with one disaster after another. Eventually, the Navy's crack frigates won some improbable victories, boosting home-front morale. The Army finally became a fighting force in 1814 after the feckless state militias (whose ''yeoman virtue'' Jefferson predicted would make the conquest of Canada ''a mere matter of marching'') had straggled home with their muskets.
 The nation's merchant ships had been brutally harried on the high seas by both the British and the French. Yet the United States grandiosely demanded Canada and Florida -- and could have ended up losing Maine to Canada and the Northwest Territory to the Indians. One begins to wonder if Hofstadter's characterization of the war as ''ludicrous and unnecessary'' doesn't contain some truth. (I would have also welcomed more discussion by Wills of the economic interests in the conflict.) Adams, however, praised the war as a necessary exercise in nationalism, enabling America to shed its inferiority complex to England.
 Madison left office in 1817 with America indeed more united, and more soundly and centrally governed and financed, than in 1800. Wills holds that Adams's belief in Jefferson's democratic faith was justified, despite his misguided tolerance of Jefferson's support of slavery. By entrusting himself to the will of the people and their hopes for a better future, Jefferson became a ''transmitter of forces that would make the outcome glorious.''
 To his rereading of Adams's ''History'' Garry Wills brings a lucid style, imaginative analysis and the talent for historical elucidation that won him a Pulitzer Prize for ''Lincoln at Gettysburg.'' He has cogently made the case for Adams as a masterly diplomatic, military and financial historian, and I unreservedly recommend this book -- and, of course, Adams's books as well.

MADE IN DETROIT
 A South of 8-Mile Memoir.
 By Paul Clemens.
 244 pp. Doubleday. $23.95.
Every year in Detroit, on the night before Halloween, the city tries to burn itself down. It wasn't always this way. In the 1950's, children would engage in more benign pranks -- ringing doorbells and running away, for instance, or toilet-papering their neighbors' trees. But by the 1980's Detroit's teenagers, and many adults as well, had taken to arson. 
 On Halloween morning, newspapers reported the number of fires (the figure peaked at 810 fires in 1984), and firemen printed these numbers on T-shirts made every year to commemorate the event, which is called ''Devil's Night.'' (Another popular T-shirt of that time read, ''Detroit: Where the Weak Are Killed and Eaten.'') In an effort to account for this phenomenon, Coleman Young, the city's vituperative, flamboyant mayor from 1973 to 1993, explained that ''to a unique degree, Detroit had buildings to burn.''
 This was because the city had been hemorrhaging population for the past three decades. From just under two million residents in 1950, Detroit -- faced with the decline of the automobile industry, rising crime rates and race riots --had lost nearly half of its population by 1990. Not everyone was moving out, however. Just the white people. The white population dropped precipitously in that period, making Detroit the blackest big city in American history.
 Paul Clemens has written an excellent memoir, ''Made in Detroit,'' in which the story of his youth contains the story of his city's death. Clemens was born in 1973, a major turning point in Detroit's history. (He is roughly the same age as the white rapper Eminem, whose own experience of growing up in Detroit was dramatized in the film ''8 Mile.'') A year earlier, Motown Records owner Berry Gordy Jr. moved his music empire to Hollywood, an event that for Clemens signaled the city's irrevocable decline: ''It was like the wind leaving Chicago,'' he sighs. The next year Young, the city's first black mayor, was elected by a slim margin. Significantly, 1973 was the year in which the black population of the city grew even with the white; thereafter, blacks would hold an ever-increasing majority. The few white families that remained moved farther and farther from the city center toward Eight Mile, the road that marks Detroit's northern boundary.
 Clemens grew up in one of these families, the only son of an Italian housecleaner and an automobile mechanic. As a result, Clemens found himself caught between two competing religions: Catholicism and cars. Often the two converged: in Detroit, Clemens writes, ''the Big Three were churches, their divisions denominations.'' After memorizing the Nicene Creed and the Lord's Prayer in Catholic school, Clemens spends afternoons in the garage, where he acquires a finer appreciation of valve springs and camshafts, while watching his father tinker silently beneath the chassis of one of the family cars. He was ''the only person I know able to shift his way from first through fifth without his foot once touching the clutch,'' Clemens says, with a level of admiration that only a fellow Detroiter could fully appreciate.
 Yet Clemens grows disillusioned with his parents' obsessions when he realizes that neither adequately addresses the problems of race that seem responsible for every major event in his, and his city's, life. For neither the Baltimore Catechism nor the 15 car magazines his father faithfully read can help Clemens understand what it means to be ''white in a city that wasn't white any longer -- a city where, when your car was stolen and a black Detroit cop happened, several hours later, to arrive on the scene, the quizzical look you were given said, 'What are you doing here?' -- as if . . . I were a doddering British farmer, stubbornly tending land in a country I insisted on calling Rhodesia.'' 
 L iving in a predominantly black city, he knows better than to blame Detroit's black population for the city's miseries. He despises the haughty white escapees in the wealthy suburbs of Grosse Pointe, who hire his mother to clean their toilets, with as much vitriol as he does his delinquent, unemployed neighbor whose car booms rap music outside his window at 3 in the morning. He mocks white liberals who abase themselves before blackness (particularly Norman Mailer, whose essay ''The White Negro'' Clemens excoriates), as well as black Detroiters who blame their struggles on institutional racism, even after blacks have taken over every institution in the city. 
 Clemens's evenhandedness is tested when a man tries to carjack his aging father, and when he discovers that his future wife had been raped by a black man. In his furious response to these events Clemens rages nearly to the point of incoherence, directing his anger at the writers whose books have most inspired and maddened him (literature has replaced cars and Catholicism as his chosen faith). In response to a line from James Baldwin's ''Fire Next Time,'' Clemens asks, ''If I've spent this much time reading you, and you say that I still don't know you, then is it my comprehension that's lacking, or your level of expression?'' Malcolm X is mocked for calling his white grandfather a ''white racist'' even though Malcolm later admits he knows nothing about the man. (This doesn't keep Clemens from disagreeing with Malcolm's conclusion, following his pilgrimage to Mecca, that ''the white man is not inherently evil.'') Clemens recognizes in these books, as well as in those by William Faulkner and Ralph Ellison, the hypocrisy and confusion about race that he has witnessed firsthand in Detroit. ''Made in Detroit'' is Clemens's response, and besides being a funny and moving memoir, it is one of the frankest accounts of race relations in America in recent years.

HEADLINE: It Could Happen Here

BYLINE: By Michael Balboni. 
Michael Balboni is a Republican state senator from East Williston.

DATELINE: Garden City Park 

 BODY:
AS our nation watches the continuing horror of Hurricane Katrina, and as flood waters recede and the states on the Gulf of Mexico struggle for recovery, the people of Long Island should be asking themselves not whether it could happen here, but what happens when it does. 
 We know the keys to survival, mitigation and recovery, but preparation means more than food, water and flashlights. It also means having the economic depth to recover from unprecedented catastrophic damage.
In a calamity like Hurricane Katrina, the expertise of emergency management personnel on Long Island, along with effective evacuation programs and state-of-the-art early warning systems, would certainly help minimize injuries and loss of life. But when it comes to financial recovery, we may not be so well prepared. 
 Take Florida, for example. In 1992, Florida was hit by Hurricane Andrew. Property damage exceeded $22 billion in today's dollars. Half a dozen property and casualty insurers went bankrupt. Affected property owners struggled to get claims paid while the rest of the state's homeowners contended with higher premiums and limited insurance availability. 
 Because of its real estate values, reconstruction costs and high-density development, if a full-force hurricane hit Long Island, replacement costs would most likely dwarf those of Florida's experience. And while that doesn't happen every year, or even every decade, it does happen.
 The 1938 hurricane obliterated the western end of Long Island and parts of New England. It took hundreds of lives and left 63,000 people homeless. Its winds blew at more than 130 miles per hour and churned the ocean with such extraordinary force that it carved out the Shinnecock Inlet.
 But all that damage was done at a time when vast stretches of Nassau and Suffolk Counties were farmland or wild. The damage that would occur today would be as unthinkable as severe storms are unpredictable. And, while we can't forecast when or where those storms will hit, we can and should prepare for the possibility.
 Truly catastrophic events that go far beyond predictable and localized disaster scenarios require a partnership between the government and the private sector. Why? Because the government often lacks the ability to provide necessary assistance in an efficient and effective way and the private sector, particularly insurance companies, may not have sufficient resources to meet the financial demands of a world-class storm.
 According to the Government Accountability Office, the insurance industry has not been truly tested by a major catastrophic event in New York. Such an event, ''could severely disrupt insurance markets and impose substantial recovery costs on governments, businesses and individuals.'' If money to cushion the blow of catastrophes doesn't increase and insurers go bankrupt, residents would be left surrounded by devastation with little ability to rebuild their homes and lives.
 In response to Hurricane Andrew, the Florida Legislature established a property-damage catastrophe fund that spreads out the burden of paying claims and helps stabilize the market. As a result, when a series of hurricanes hit Florida last year, resulting in $23 billion in property damage, the property insurers remained solvent. 
 New York's Legislature needs to adopt a similar fund. Property insurance now works like this: There is a primary layer of insurance and several layers of secondary reinsurance that kick in when claims exceed a certain amount. Like the Florida fund, New York's would work with insurers to set up a government-controlled -- and, therefore, nontaxable and nonprofit -- pool, financed by one layer of excess insurance. The fund, which would be allowed to grow and be available for a major event, would be used only for in-state claims. 
 The immediate need right now in the Gulf States is for food, shelter, medicine and clothing. But in the months that follow, they will need money to rebuild. New Yorkers, particularly those of us on Long Island who would be most affected by a hurricane like Katrina, need to encourage our state to take the necessary steps that will provide us with every possible advantage when the winds of disaster blow here.

HEADLINE: Another Victim: Gulf Coast Gambling

BYLINE: By AUSTIN CONSIDINE

 BODY:
Beyond New Orleans, one of the areas hit hardest by Hurricane Katrina was the Mississippi Gulf Coast, including Gulfport (below), Biloxi, Bay St. Louis and Ocean Springs. The region was a center for offshore casinos -- a big tourist draw and a boost for the state and regional economies. 
 ''We have barges that are either in parking lots or in the street, we have most of our cultural product either severely damaged or gone,'' said Steve Richer, director of the Gulf Coast Convention and Visitors Bureau, who had fled to Florida to escape the storm.
Gambling and tourism officials estimate losses of roughly $500,000 a day while the casinos remain out of business, and say the storm has affected about 14,000 jobs. The damage represents an economic blow to the state, which, according to the Census Bureau, has the highest poverty rate in the country. Income from Gulf Coast gambling represented about 44 percent of the state's gross gambling revenues in 2004, and the industry as a whole provides about 10 percent of the state's total budget, according to the commission. About three-quarters of that income came from out-of-state visitors.
 All casinos in Mississippi are offshore, by state law. Larry Gregory, executive director of the Mississippi Gaming Commission, said that of the 13 casinos on the coast, only the Beau Rivage in Biloxi remained relatively intact. 
 Whether the casinos will rebuild would most likely be ''the No. 1 issue'' the State Legislature will need to address, Mr. Gregory said. ''And whether or not to put them on land.''
 Inland, clusters of casinos on the Mississippi River have survived. Webster Franklin, executive director of the Tunica Convention and Visitors Bureau, said the hurricane had not damaged Tunica, which brings in 45 percent of gambling revenues. 
 ''We're setting up shelters, working with the Red Cross, doing feeding centers and things like that,'' Mr. Franklin said. ''We've got thousands of people here who don't have a home to return to.'' AUSTIN CONSIDINE

HEADLINE: The Chinese, Too, May Be Worth Copying

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN. 
William J. Holstein is editor in chief of Chief Executive magazine.

 BODY:
THE American economy is more open than Western Europe's, and may be better able to respond to challenges from China and elsewhere, says Gerard Kleisterlee, chief executive of Royal Philips Electronics, the multinational company based in Amsterdam. Here are excerpts from a conversation:

Q. Many Americans think that Western Europe is growing very slowly and faces stagnation. Is that right?

A. That's also the popular image among European executives and policy makers. In a number of countries, initiatives are being taken to reform the economy and reform labor policies, and to deregulate, because we have excessive regulation. But the pace of change is simply too slow.

Q. Is the economic emergence of China and other countries going to change the world order as we know it?

A. It is going to have an impact on the world order. But I don't see it as a one-sided debate where the Europeans or Americans see the emergence of China and India just as a competitive threat. It's also an opportunity, because every day more people are joining the economy and becoming consumers. They need products. China has a balanced import-export situation with the rest of the world. A lot of textile and consumer electronics are being exported out of China. But on the other hand, things like airplanes and sophisticated equipment and tools are being imported into China. As long as the Western world continues to invest in the education of our children and in the quality of universities and research institutes, they can stay ahead of the game in terms of technological development.

Q. But we're seeing entire industries moving offshore. Is that cause for alarm?

A. Yes, we will see some industries migrate, but we will also see new opportunities on the high-tech side and the services side. When Europeans ask me, ''What is the future of European manufacturing?'' I say, ''Apparently we are good in complex systems, whether it is Airbus or high-end cars.'' Both the Americans and Europeans are good at this. We have the infrastructures, we have the know-how, we have the technology. We can put it together. China is focused on mass manufacturing.

Q. One of the debates Americans have is about whether the Chinese can innovate. They can copy, but can they develop new products that reach the market?

A. I see no reason why they couldn't. I would not stereotype them as copiers. They're working hard to develop their own indigenous technologies and their own standards.

Q. What do you make in China?

A. We manufacture some percentage of all the things we sell in China. We have a fully integrated medical systems business, but we also import high-end equipment from the United States and Europe into China. We have our semiconductor operations, but no wafer fabrication plants there. Those are in the United States, Europe and Singapore.
 We are the largest multinational in China measured by total activity level, which was $9 billion last year, and measured by exports volume. Of that $9 billion, $3 billion was sold in China and $6 billion was exported. We are not the largest by total dollars invested or total employment, but on the basis of these other two measures, we are.

Q. How do you think American companies are faring in the new world order?

A. I think they are responding fairly well. Take the top 100 companies in market capitalization and you see that American companies are well represented in that league. Neither the emergence of the Japanese, nor the Koreans, nor the Chinese and after them the Indians, fundamentally changes the picture. Yes, it brings new companies into the game. You will have some shakeout, but, by and large, this is the strongest economy in the world.
 The American economy works because of its openness and its market-focused competitiveness. There is a high degree of adaptability. You may have U.S. companies that go under, but you will have more that survive and prosper.

Q. Which American companies do you respect the most?

A. General Electric is a formidable competitor. It commands a lot of respect because of its processes. On a different front, in I.B.M., people are pioneers in new breakthroughs. We also learn from them and adapt. If I see something good, I take it.

Q. So you're learning from American multinationals?

A. Of course, but I'm also learning from Chinese start-ups. To me, the whole essence of prospering as a business is to know that every day, everywhere, there is something you can learn. You learn from successes, but you also learn from failures. You need to have that mind-set.

Q. What have you learned from Chinese start-ups?

A. How to be extremely pragmatic in getting yourself into the market. I have taken my board to China a few times, not only to have internal discussions, but also to go out into the marketplace.
 We talk with Lenovo and TCL and you see how their young management teams have built their businesses with very low overhead and are very focused. Sometimes we make things too complex. We can be overly focused on process, but the Chinese are very focused on results. They are learning faster than you can imagine.

HEADLINE: Buying Is Easy Owning Is Hard

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
THOUSANDS of fledgling landlords are scooping up small multiple-unit dwellings throughout the New York area -- pristine two-families in the Rockaways, for instance, or vintage buildings along Manhattan side streets or in Brooklyn's brownstone enclaves -- but some of them do not quite know what they are getting into.
 Being a landlord means dealing with multiple challenges: choosing the right tenants, planning for a panoply of legal, financial and maintenance obligations, navigating the bureaucratic maze and understanding that for the small landlord there are no economies of scale -- no discount on the low-volume fuel bill; top dollar to the tradesman called in because there is no plumber on staff; in fact, probably, no staff. So just who does take out the garbage?
But many buyers do not know about those responsibilities, at least not in the beginning. ''You're talking about amateur landlords,'' said Vincent S. Castellano, who from 1994 to 1999 was host of ''Real Estate Nightmares,'' a radio talk show that is no longer on the air. ''These people buy the two-family so the rental will help pay the mortgage. They think it's easy because this class of housing seems familiar, but they're completely unaware of the pitfalls.'' 
 Fifteen years ago, Dulce de la Cruz was one of those novice landlords, dreaming of gathering her family into the six-unit building she bought on Lincoln Road in Flatbush for $160,000. ''I have brothers and sisters and I wanted us to live together,'' said Ms. de la Cruz, who works as a nursing assistant. So far, with most of her tenants remaining and only her daughter moving in, Ms. de la Cruz's image of the future hasn't quite panned out. 
 For one thing, the previous owner wasn't quite up front about the difficulties she would face with some of the tenants -- drug sales in the hallways, nonpaying tenants, code violations caused by tenants, the woman with 10 grandchildren, three other adults and a dog in one apartment. ''He didn't tell me those things,'' she said. ''He fooled me.''
 Keeping the building afloat was rough. ''I used to work seven days a week to pay for this building,'' Ms. de la Cruz said. ''The mortgage was $1,400, plus gas, light, insurance, taxes, water and lawyer's fees, because I had to go to court to get rent money from the tenants.''
 It was never easy, getting that money. 
 ''When you ring the bell,'' she said, ''they'd go, 'What do you want?' and slam the door.''
 The troublemakers have since been evicted, but not before Ms. de la Cruz learned to take photographs, with dates displayed, to show Housing Court judges that she had repaired the damage caused by some tenants. 
 Then, four years ago, the big turnaround came: a $330,000, low-interest construction loan arranged by Neighborhood Housing Services of New York City through the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, allowing for a complete building renovation. ''I never got the money in my hand,'' Ms. de la Cruz said. ''It goes right to the contractor that H.P.D. hired to do the work.''
 Now, with the work done, Ms. de la Cruz has larger debt payments, but she has been able to slowly raise rents to about $800 for four of the apartments. ''And my daughter took over an apartment for $700,'' she said. ''Believe me, this is a piece of cake today compared to what I had.'' 
 To those who have dealt over the years with small landlords, the major pitfall is obvious. ''If you get a tenant from hell and it takes eight months to evict this person,'' said Mr. Castellano, owner of Picture Properties, a real estate brokerage firm in the Rockaways, ''how are you going to carry the mortgage on your own?''
 In today's bullish real estate market, with its low interest rates and aggressive mortgage marketing, it is also true that home seekers are often pushed to buy ''as much house'' as they can afford, under the assumption that their incomes will increase. ''That's why they're vulnerable, because the first couple of years they're counting nickels to pay their bills,'' Mr. Castellano said.
 And for first-time landlords -- so often double-income couples buying a two- or three-family home -- that recalcitrant renter is just one land mine. ''What if one of them gets laid off or injured or pregnant, and their income goes down?'' Mr. Castellano said. ''Sometimes the cushion is wide enough to manage one negative impact. But two negative impacts and you're in foreclosure.''
 It hasn't quite come to that for Lloyd Noel and his mother, who took possession of a four-story, eight-unit building on New York Avenue in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, after her divorce in 2000. 
 ''It was something we didn't know anything about, becoming a landlord,'' Mr. Noel said. ''My mother took the building because it was her only source of income.''
 Unlike the one nonpaying tenant out of 200 in a large apartment complex, the lone contentious tenant in an eight-unit building can cause considerable strain on a small landlord's income. And that is true even if, as in Helen Noel's case, the elderly woman in Apartment 2L who still pays $95 a month for a rent-controlled apartment had some justification for all those Housing Court claims.
 Mr. Noel, 36, said his father had owned the building since 1976. The family did not live on the premises, but Mr. Noel now rents an apartment for $800 a month. 
 The other rents are $1,200, $1,100, $953, $930, $853, $763 and $95 -- bringing the total rental income to $6,694 a month. But with mortgage payments of $3,300 and other monthly expenses, including $900 for gas and $500 for insurance, the Noels tiptoe along a slim profit margin, especially with that low of $95 from the woman in 2L. 
 ''My father and her used to battle it out in court,'' Mr. Noel said. ''Her apartment was in the worst condition in the building: holes in the floor, windows broken, doors missing. She'd show pictures that it was never repaired and she would get a decrease.'' After the last reduction, in 1992, Mr. Noel said: ''My father felt it was a waste of time to take her to court. He refused to fix her apartment, and because he refused he left the rent alone.''
 Mr. Noel and his mother spent $23,000 to renovate Apartment 2L: new windows, kitchen cabinets, floor tiles, a paint job. ''Knowing we had a ton of violations on that apartment, we haven't raised her rent,'' Mr. Noel said. Now they are waiting for the city to verify that the violations have been cleared, ''and after that we can raise her rent to $750,'' he said. 
 Advocating the safety of a ''belt-and-suspenders budgeting approach,'' Sarah Gerecke, chief executive of Neighborhood Housing Services, said that small landlords should underestimate their monthly rental income by about 10 percent, in case an apartment is unexpectedly vacated, while creating a contingency fund equal to three months of operating expenses.
 The linchpin for a smooth operation is, however, good landlord-tenant relations. 
 Ms. Gerecke said a course given by her agency teaches landlords how to verify an applicant's credit history, income, rent-payment history and references. Or, if there are difficult tenants already in place, whether it is worth the risk to buy the building in the first place. 
 ''It can be a successful marriage or a dysfunctional divorce,'' she said, pointing out that in two- and three-family home situations, where a tenant is often a relative, things can get particularly sticky. ''You may need to learn to resolve conflicts in a different way,'' she said. ''Yes, we're relatives, but this is business.''
 Relative or not, new tenant or old, the relationship must be based on ''communication of clear expectations,'' Ms. Gerecke said. Among the matters that should be discussed in advance, she said, are pets, smoking, parking, garbage removal, even who changes the light bulbs and, of course, noise. ''Maybe headphones should come with the lease,'' she said. ''Is the upstairs apartment carpeted?'' A videotaped walk-through with the tenant is recommended.
 Sherwin Belkin, a real estate lawyer, leads new landlords through the intricacies of the process in Manhattan. ''Too often, I find that first-time landlords look only at the building's location, value, structural soundness and the ability to obtain clean title,'' he said. ''They should also thoroughly investigate who their current tenants are,'' particularly whether they are rent-regulated.
 ''The new landlord steps into the shoes of the prior owners,'' Mr. Belkin said, and needs to determine whether tenants are habitually delinquent in paying rent, or are litigious. At the same time, he said, ''an owner who buys a rent-stabilized property becomes liable for any rent overcharges during the previous four years, even though the monies were paid to the prior landlord.''
 If a new landlord plans to take over all or several apartments for personal use, it is necessary to determine whether any rent-stabilized tenants are 62 or older or are disabled, ''because he will be obligated to provide those people with a comparable relocation apartment,'' Mr. Belkin added. 
 And the new owner needs to know if any tenants have lived in rent-controlled apartments for more than 20 years, because they are immune from owner-occupancy proceedings. ''I had a client who came to me after he purchased an Upper West Side town house with the intention of vacating several floors to create a large family residence,'' Mr. Belkin said. The new owner did not realize that a tenant had lived in a rent-controlled apartment for more than 20 years, right in the middle of the planned family residence. ''Although we were ultimately able to vacate the unit, it was only by purchasing a small condominium apartment on the West Side where we could move the tenant,'' Mr. Belkin said.
 Still, there are plenty of benefits to becoming a landlord, and many people enjoy it. In February, Nelly Anderson bought a house on Maple Parkway in the Mariners Harbor section of northern Staten Island ''and is glad to be a landlord,'' according to her son Elvis Byrd, 42, who lives in the house. 
 Mrs. Anderson, a home attendant who is 64 and nearing retirement, is enjoying both the comfort of living with kin and the benefits of rental income.
 Mr. Byrd, who pays his mother $1,000 a month in rent and brings the skills of a home-improvement worker to the equation, lives upstairs in a four-bedroom with his wife, Sheriee, and their three children. The woman who lives in the adjoining unit with her three children pays $1,300 a month. ''They've been living here for four years,'' Mr. Byrd said. When Mrs. Anderson bought the house, she continued to rent to them.
 Mrs. Anderson bought the 1907 three-family house with cedar shingles and aluminum siding for $350,000, made a down payment of $35,000 and pays $2,040 a month on the mortgage -- more than covered by the rental income. ''You couldn't go wrong with buying a three-family home because you have someone helping pay the mortgage,'' Mr. Byrd said.
 Dina Calhoun is also a novice landlord and describes her experiences as ''so far, so good.'' Six months ago, Ms. Calhoun, a clerk for Verizon Communications, paid $225,000 for a two-family on 109th Street in Jamaica, Queens, and moved into the upstairs three-bedroom. 
 She joined a local church, ''and I met them there,'' Ms. Calhoun said of her tenants. The couple and their 9-year-old son moved in in May, and are paying less than the $1,500 to $1,600 a month that most three-bedrooms in the neighborhood currently rent for. 
 ''We had a long discussion on my expectations, and they shared what they wanted,'' Ms. Calhoun said. ''My conditions were to maintain the condition of the apartment. If they want a barbecue in the backyard, let me know in advance. I agreed to let them park in my driveway.''
 Her tenants have become friends. ''We help each other with stuff,'' Ms. Calhoun said. ''My son plays with their son. I'm keeping my fingers crossed, and praying.''

New Landlords Can Get Help
 TO guide neophyte landlords through the minefields of ownership, Neighborhood Housing Services, a nonprofit organization, offers classes for small landlords in all five boroughs. About 2,200 people have taken the landlord classes since 1995. (The organization also offers seminars for first-time home buyers.)
 The landlord course covers the full array of issues facing a new building owner: mortgage, insurance, tax responsibilities, housing discrimination, building-code requirements, the intricacies of rent regulation, and writing the lease. ''Even if it's just a two-family, it's important to have a lease,'' said Sarah Gerecke, chief executive of Neighborhood Housing Services.
 Landlords taking the course, which costs $100 and includes five two-hour sessions, are familiarized with the 26 governmental agencies that regulate one or another phase of rental housing in the city -- including the Buildings Department, the Fire Department, the Rent Guidelines Board, the Bureau of Electrical Control and the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal. 
 The course offers guidelines for writing a business plan. ''You start with knowing your operating expenses, so you can figure the minimum rents you must charge,'' Ms. Gerecke said. The major expenses are the mortgage, taxes, utilities and insurance. But what many people don't take into account, Ms. Gerecke said, are annual expenses, like servicing the boiler or cleaning the gutters, and major repairs in the future. ''Ten years down the road, the roof will need to be fixed,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Going It Alone In Divorce Court

BYLINE: By AVI SALZMAN

 BODY:
THE mother from North Haven sat in the back of Judge Patricia L. Harleston's wood-paneled courtroom at the New Haven County Courthouse and cried quietly. She was unemployed, she owed more than $2,000 in child support and she had no idea how she was going to defend herself. She said she couldn't afford a lawyer, so she was representing herself at the child support hearing. Meanwhile, the lawyer for the father of her children sat across the room. 
 ''I don't know what my rights are,'' said the mother, who asked that her name not be used because of the sensitive nature of the hearing. ''When someone else has an attorney, they know all the ins and outs and I don't.''
Her situation was far from unusual. Judges, lawyers and other court personnel said in interviews that an increasing number of people over the last few years have been representing themselves in family cases, which include divorces and child-support and paternity hearings. The judges and lawyers said most people are representing themselves because they can't afford lawyers. And since there is usually no guaranteed representation in Family Court, like in criminal cases, and legal aid groups don't have the staff to step in, these ''pro se'' litigants are being forced to go to court alone. 
 In the fiscal year that ended on June 30, 51 percent of the people in family cases and 45.7 percent of those in divorce cases represented themselves, according to statistics from the Connecticut Judicial Branch. That's almost 5 percentage points more pro se parties in divorce cases than the previous year. 
 A separate judicial branch study of pending divorce cases in 2001 found that 26 percent of the parties were pro se. While many of those cases are straightforward and mostly involve paperwork, others are more complicated. In those cases, people with no training who try to represent themselves must learn the rules of evidence and court decorum on the fly. It doesn't always go well.
 ''A few poor people are lucky enough to get legal services, but it's very few,'' said Paul Garlinghouse, a New Haven family lawyer who has worked in a clinic to teach people to represent themselves. ''But then you have this huge mass of low-income and moderate-income people who just have to go it alone. You see them every day. They just stand up there, and it's painful to watch.''
 And all too often, the experts said, the litigant without a lawyer is a woman.
 ''What really is disturbing to me is that one spouse, often the woman, is unrepresented and the other has a lawyer,'' he said. ''Any decent attorney can run rings around a pro se.'' 
 Pro se representation was not always seen as a symptom of the legal system's economic divide. When people first started representing themselves in Family Court, many considered it empowering.
 In the early 1970's, it was virtually unheard of to go into court without a lawyer. Sarah D. Eldrich, a divorce lawyer in New Haven, was divorced in 1972 when she was a 21-year-old student at Quinnipiac University. Ms. Eldrich, who worked at the New Haven Legal Assistance Association while she was attending college, knew how to draft the papers for a divorce, but said she was discouraged from doing the divorce herself. The experience, she recalled in a recent interview, made her feel powerless. 
 ''It was just plain wrong,'' she said. ''People should have access to courts.'' 
 Just a year after Ms. Eldrich ended her marriage, divorce in Connecticut changed dramatically, opening the way to more pro se representation. In 1973, the Legislature passed a law allowing no-fault divorces, so a married couple who had decided to break up did not have to prove it was someone's fault. That eliminated the sometimes difficult process of showing that one party had committed adultery or had been intolerably cruel, which were two of the reasons spouses could give for seeking a divorce. 
 Still, in the early years of no-fault divorces, most people still went to lawyers for help, even for simple cases. A study conducted in two family courts in Connecticut from 1974 to 1976 and published in the Yale Law Journal found that 2.7 percent of the cases involved a pro se litigant. 
 Ms. Eldrich and others she knew through the New Haven women's movement vowed to change that. They published a book that taught people how to do their own divorces if the cases were simple, believing that it would empower people to get involved directly in the court system. And because women were often the ones to initiate the divorce, they considered the book a way to empower women particularly, said Diane Polan, one of the authors. 
 That book, ''Do Your Own Divorce in Connecticut,'' was published in 1975 and was distributed mainly at women's centers. The authors also taught divorce litigants how to represent themselves and worked with judges to smooth the process.
 Ms. Polan said she never meant for people with complicated divorces to represent themselves. 
 ''When we wrote the book we thought it was for a very limited group of people to use,'' she said.
 As time went on, other factors played a role in spurring the increase of pro se litigants. Shirley M. Pripstein, who practices family law with Greater Hartford Legal Aid, said federal budget cuts in the mid-1990's sapped agencies that provided free legal service to the poor. Legal aid lawyers began to concentrate on the most difficult cases, such as those involving domestic abuse. They didn't have time or resources for poor people involved in more-standard divorce cases. 
 ''So many poor people were calling legal services and they couldn't all be represented,'' Ms. Pripstein said. 
 The Judicial Branch also gradually grew more accommodating, creating its own books and manuals on how to represent oneself in a family case. Courthouses began providing mediators to talk people through their cases and attempt to broker a compromise.
 In New Haven, for instance, Family Court litigants must talk to a family services counselor before their case. Eight courthouses have court service centers, which offer guidebooks on the court system and are staffed with court personnel. Ten have public information desks. Much of the information necessary to complete a divorce is also available online. 
 Those services, said Judge Julia Dewey, the state's chief administrative judge for the family division, made people feel more comfortable standing in front of a judge without a lawyer by their side. The court system's new openness may have contributed to the increase in pro se representation, judges said. 
 ''It's not uncommon now to have both parties in a contested case or at least one pro se,'' said Judge Elliot N. Solomon, the presiding judge in Family Court in the Hartford Judicial District. ''It's certainly nowhere near as rare as it was in the late 90's.'' 
 Now, even those who initially tried to get more people to represent themselves said there are problems, fueled at least partially by lawyer's fees that few of the poor can afford. It's not uncommon for a lawyer to ask for a $5,000 retainer to take a divorce case. Fees vary in different parts of the state -- anecdotes from lawyers and judges indicated that Fairfield County lawyers charge the highest prices -- but it is difficult to find anyone who charges less than $200 an hour and not uncommon for lawyers to charge $500 an hour, lawyers and judges said.
 Judge Solomon said a day's worth of hearings in a divorce case can end up costing each litigant $5,000. Even middle-class people, he said, can't afford that. 
 ''How do you make it on $60,000, paying $10,000?'' Judge Solomon said. 
 Legal services organizations can't keep up with the number of people seeking help, said Patricia Kaplan, the executive director of the New Haven Legal Assistance Association. To deal with the overflow, the association holds classes on pro se representation in English and Spanish. 
 ''We have fewer resources to do family services,'' Ms. Kaplan said. ''We give a lot of pro se advice to other people so they can represent themselves.''
 The North Haven mother, for instance, said she was rejected by the New Haven agency, despite being unemployed.
 ''I feel like I'm getting a raw deal,'' she said. ''I applied to legal aid for help, I applied to women's rights services for help and they both denied me.''
 These days, it's not just the very poor who are doing their own divorces. As fees rise, more people who are well above the poverty line have chosen to go pro se, judges and lawyers said. 
 Some lawyers said it isn't fair to point the finger at them. Sarah S. Oldham, a Westport lawyer who is the former chairwoman of the family law section of the Connecticut Bar Association, said fees have risen at a similar rate to other goods and services, and it is often litigants, not lawyers, who make cases contentious.
 ''It's very convenient to blame the lawyer,'' Ms. Oldham said.
 Whoever is to blame, the increased numbers of pro se litigants have created headaches for the court system. Pro se litigants generally take much more time than lawyers to make their cases. And judges worry about where to draw the line between nudging a party back on track and giving legal advice from the bench. 
 Pro se divorces, Judge Solomon said, sometimes devolve into a free-for-all. 
 ''The parties often have no clue as to proper procedure,'' he said. ''They start a question, but it turns into a narrative.''
 People who are paying for lawyers also lose out when litigants drone on about irrelevant matters. At $500 an hour, sitting on a cold, hard bench in Family Court listening to a pro se litigant waste time can be very costly.
 The outcome of a pro se litigant's case often depends on the judge. Some judges said they spend extra time with pro se litigants to make sure they know what they're doing. If an agreement is questionable, the judge may refuse to approve it. And some judges ask lawyers to step in when a case is particularly lopsided. 
 Mr. Garlinghouse, the New Haven lawyer, said he has been asked to intervene in cases where pro se litigants are being hurt. In other cases, he said, he has watched helplessly as divorces tilted dramatically against one party. 
 ''I've been in court and seen people crying in frustration,'' he said. ''People may have a good case, but they can't explain it to the judge.'' 
 People who represent themselves sometimes feel like the system is stacked against them. Josue Bonilla of Woodbridge walked out of a court hearing in August in which his child support had been raised by more than $100 and said he had gotten ''burned.''
 ''I lost everything,'' he said.
 A lawyer could have helped him, but he said a lawyer wasn't an option. 
 ''I had no choice,'' he said. ''Can't afford it.''
 The increasing number of pro se litigants is a problem without an easy solution, judges and lawyers said. The Judicial Branch formed committees in the last 10 years to figure out what to do about the increase in pro se representation, but their recommendations, many of which have been implemented, have not markedly changed the system.
 Instead, the parties involved have had to adapt. Court officials have worked to make courthouses easier to navigate and lawyers have done more pro bono work or charged certain clients reduced rates. Sometimes, lawyers allow clients to pay for some services, but not others. 
 Any large-scale change will likely be costly, lawyers said. Without changes, however, some said the system sends the wrong message. 
 ''Why can't a woman who is in an abusive marriage and makes $30,000 get a lawyer, if a person charged with selling dope can get one?'' Ms. Polan asked.

HEADLINE: Disasters Waiting To Happen

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
MORE than a thousand miles of levees stretch east from San Francisco Bay. They protect the cities and the farmland in the Sacramento-San Joaquin delta of California and keep salt from the bay out of the drinking water of millions of people. But those levees are deteriorating, experts say, raising the odds of a Katrina-like disaster for the nation's most populous state.
 The delta and its maze of levees are high on the list of public infrastructure considered to be subpar. That list -- which also includes highways, dams, ports and bridges -- is growing as government outlays for repair lose out to budget cutting. The American Society of Civil Engineers, whose 137,000 members are involved in virtually every public works project undertaken in the United States, says that $1.6 trillion must be spent over the next five years to prevent further deterioration. Only $900 billion is now earmarked.
Absent the additional spending, said Lawrence Roth, deputy executive director of the society, ''every natural disaster is going to be more destructive than it needs to be.'' 
 Infrastructure deteriorates in more than one way. There is lack of maintenance: roughly 13,000 highway fatalities each year, for example, are a result of inadequate maintenance of aging highways, the civil engineers say. And there is overuse: the levees in California, many of them built by farmers to convert marshes to farmland, now must be strengthened to prevent the destruction of newly built communities.
 ''This is the fastest-growing region in California, and the bulk of that growth is taking place on the flood plains,'' said Jeffrey F. Mount, a geology professor and the director of the Watershed Center at the University of California, Davis. ''What we are doing is creating our own New Orleans.''
 To Professor Mount, there is too much deterioration of public infrastructure for the next disaster to be thought of as unheralded. Even before Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast, for example, there was wide public awareness of the potential crisis that New Orleans faced from its inadequate levees. Yet nothing happened. Why? Repairing or rebuilding infrastructure to protect the public is expensive, and the nation is spending less.
 Total government spending on public infrastructure -- that is, spending by states and municipalities as well as by federal agencies -- amounted to roughly 2.25 percent of the gross domestic product in the early 1950's. It rose to about 3 percent in the Eisenhower era of interstate highway construction and in the Kennedy and Johnson years. Through the 1980's and 1990's, however, infrastructure investment fell well below 2 percent, and is now just below that level.
 AS spending lost ground, standards changed. Current criteria rely more on a cost-versus-benefit formula, in contrast to the grander visions of those earlier years. Does the benefit from a public investment exceed the cost? Laced into that calculation is a gamble: benefits that rarely occur are not counted. A levee system in New Orleans capable of withstanding a Category 4 hurricane like Katrina is not counted because such storms are fairly rare.
 John Paul Woodley, the assistant secretary of the Army for civil works, says he struggles with this standard. He has jurisdiction over the Army Corps of Engineers, which takes the lead in building and maintaining public works along the nation's waterways, including thousands of miles of levees. For the first time, Mr. Woodley is pushing to postpone some projects so that more can be spent on others.
 ''I have more works in progress than the budget can fund at an efficient level, and that is a problem,'' Mr. Woodley said in an interview. ''I have two options then. I can rigorously prioritize and decide that some will be quickly finished and others postponed, or I can spread the money across all the projects, deferring the completion dates for all of them but postponing none. Our 2006 budget calls for suspension of a large number of projects in order to concentrate on a small number that will be completed efficiently.''
 In California's delta, that approach translates into $20 million this year to improve the levees that protect Sacramento, the state capital, at the confluence of the American and Sacramento Rivers, and to strengthen the Folsom Dam, upstream from the city. But virtually no federal money is earmarked for other nearby levees that protect smaller communities, cropland and the conduits that bring drinking water to Southern California.
 California's state government struggles with that issue. The Schwarzenegger administration has proposed more spending on the levees than the Legislature has been willing to approve. Katrina raised awareness of the benefits to be reaped, but even before Katrina, a 1997 flood damaged or destroyed more than 30,000 homes and businesses, and a rupture in a levee last year resulted in $100 million worth of damage and repairs.
 ''It is possible that we are not spending enough on levees, and it is also possible that the people moving in behind those levees are not being charged enough -- for flood insurance, for example,'' said Joshua D. Angrist, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''If they were required to pay for flood insurance, they might not build there.''
 Although the delta and its levees are gaining attention now, after Hurricane Katrina, there are near-disasters that never come to public attention.
 The Army Corps of Engineers, for example, shut down the Greenup Locks and Dam on the Ohio River, upstream from Louisville, Ky., two years ago for what the corps thought would be two weeks of routine maintenance. Closer examination, once the work started, revealed much more deterioration than anticipated and the locks remained closed for eight weeks, during which coal could not move up the river on barges to power plants that supply electricity to the Midwest.
 ''We came very close to not having enough coal to power those plants,'' Mr. Woodley said. The coal did get through before stockpiles were exhausted, so in this case the public never noticed. But power failures would undoubtedly have produced plenty of public outcry.
 Locks on the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers shut down more often than Mr. Woodley would like. ''If I had more money,'' he said, ''I could reduce these shutdowns to a level that I might consider satisfactory.''
 In this age of rationed public spending, the deterioration of vital public works is increasing, and with it the potential for disaster. The American Society of Civil Engineers, for example, reports that while federally owned dams are in good condition, more than 3,500 dams maintained by states and local governments are ''unsafe'' -- and the number is rising.
 ''There are a lot of these small dams, and they can do a lot of damage,'' said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, director of the Congressional Budget Office. ''The Johnstown Flood is a famous example of a small dam failing and doing a lot of damage.'' (That flood, in Johnstown, Pa., in 1889, took more than 2,200 lives.)
 Something similar is happening with drinking water systems. Instead of an outlay of $11 billion annually, the amount the civil engineers consider necessary to replace aging pipelines and other facilities, federal spending is only $850 million. Highways and bridges also suffer from a shortfall. The highway bill signed by the president this summer stipulates an outlay of $286.4 billion over five years for both new construction and maintenance. Various Republicans, including Mr. Woodley, consider $318 billion as the minimum needed just for maintenance.
 States are filling some of the gap. Bridge tolls are rising in San Francisco, for example, to help finance a new eastern span for the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge that is more earthquake resistant than the portion of the bridge damaged in the 1989 earthquake. ''In these cases, people make a decision about the level of risk they want the infrastructure to withstand,'' said Ellen Hanak, a research fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California. And if the risk is considered great enough, they fund it.
 Assessing risks, the Army Corps of Engineers chose to spend $30 million this year to build or enlarge 57 miles of levee along the Mississippi River near New Orleans -- but on the west bank, across from the city.
 Did the construction ameliorate the damage from Katrina? Mr. Woodley does not think so. ''My initial impression,'' he said, ''is that it protects an area not struck by the surge.''

HEADLINE: After Katrina, Invest in Oil, but Shut Off the A.C. 

BYLINE: By Ben Stein. 
Ben Stein is a lawyer, writer, actor and economist. E-mail: ebiz@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
NOW for a few brief thoughts about the catastrophe that is Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath.
 First, the best investment that people with some money jingling in their pockets can make right now would probably be to send a thousand dollars -- or two or three thousand -- to the Red Cross or the Salvation Army for hurricane relief. This will possibly just pry open the gates of eternity enough to let you in -- on the good side. Merely the possibility should be enough to make you do it. 
And as the great writer and thinker Joan Didion once said to me, ''You do things like this for yourself.'' And it's true.
 Second, we stand on the edge of an energy crisis. In this crisis, I think of two great sayings. One is an economics axiom, first stated to me by Peter M. Flanigan -- a former high honcho of Dillon, Read; a high aide to my ex-boss, Richard Nixon; a very good friend to my father and me; and the smartest and handsomest man of Wall Street I ever met. He liked to say: ''There is no such thing as scarcity and no such thing as surplus. There is only price.'' 
 Right now, let us thank providence for price. Price is allocating scarce reserves of gasoline. Price is allocating oil and natural gas. Price is doing this incomparably better than any government agency could do. Let's let it keep happening and not have government -- the most incompetent allocator of everything -- have any say in it. We went down that route in 1973 and 1974, and it was a disaster. I was there and it was well intentioned but a pure mistake.
 Closely connected, I have been hearing colleagues here in glorious Los Angeles lament the high gasoline prices. They're actually saying the magic words, ''The oil companies are making obscene profits.'' Long ago, before I was smart at all, during the oil embargo of 1973, I remember saying the exact same thing to my father:
 ''Do you really think the oil companies are making obscene profits?'' he asked.
 ''Yes, I do,'' I said earnestly.
 ''Do you think they'll continue to do that?'' he asked. 
 ''Yes, I do,'' I said with equal earnestness.
 ''In that case, since you have some money, why don't you buy stock in the oil companies?'' he suggested.
 Actually, not a bad idea. I think the current price of energy is at an unsustainable level. Damage will be repaired, refineries will start refining and natural gas will be pumped to where it needs to go. Still, the long-run future of energy prices does not look good for us as consumers. Demand continues to soar. And when China and India have hundreds of millions of drivers, demand will go berserk. 
 How to profit from this? Well, simple. There are a lot of companies that own immense reserves of oil -- and gas and coal, the prices of which tend to move with oil prices. You can buy many mutual and exchange-traded funds that track these companies and will benefit from growth in their prices. (Again, I think that the short-term move is down, but that the long-term trends are favorable for producers, not consumers.) Among the exchange-traded funds are the Energy Select Sector SPDR; the iShares Goldman Sachs Natural Resources Index fund, which tracks an index that is heavily weighted toward energy; and the iShares MSCI Canada Index fund, in which the buyer gets a portfolio that is 27 percent energy-related.
 Canada is also a possible currency play as its exports of commodities soar. The big mutual fund companies all have funds that are portfolios of energy-related stocks. I own Fidelity Select Energy and Fidelity Select Natural Gas. I would be stunned if they did not have a correction in the short term. But again, their long-term demand picture is solid. And if energy prices collapse, we'll all be so happy with the rally in the rest of the stock market that we'll hardly notice our losses in the energy sector. That, of course, is for those of us who are convinced that our buying of stocks makes them go down.
 Finally, we are not all investors. (Maybe all of us reading this column are, but not everyone is.) Still, we are all consumers of energy -- though not, I hope, energy addicts. We have some control over how much energy we use. We can open the windows instead of turning on the air-conditioning when we walk into our homes. We do not need to have 6,000-pound cars driving 100-pound humans to buy one-liter bottles of imported water. If everyone in this country had just two fewer cylinders in his car, we would save an immense amount of oil. The United States is the single largest consumer of oil on earth, and the single largest use of oil here is to power cars and trucks. Is every one of your trips really necessary?
 To get back to home, do you turn off the air-conditioning when you leave the house? The lights? The TV? The computer? We are not deer caught in the headlights. We can use less oil and gas and coal if we choose. And building homes and offices with windows that open and where you can catch a breeze is a darned good place to start. 
 We are now in a vicious cycle in which the earth becomes hotter from burning fuels, we use more and more air-conditioning to cool ourselves, and more and more coal is burned to accomplish that. So the earth becomes still hotter, and on it goes -- unless the global-warming theorists are wrong. 
 In any event, we can do more to save energy. It is not really up to government. It's up to us. We have seen what government can and cannot do just this last month, and the signs are that we had better count on ourselves first.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
THE images of starving, exhausted, flood-bedraggled people fleeing New Orleans and southern Mississippi over the last two weeks have scandalized many Americans long accustomed to seeing such scenes only in faraway storm-tossed or war-ravaged places like Kosovo, Sudan or Banda Aceh. 
 But Hurricane Katrina delivered America its own refugee crisis, arguably the worst since Sherman's army burned its way across the South. And though the word ''refugee'' is offensive to some, and not accurate according to international law, it conveys a fundamental truth: these are people who will be unable to return home for months, possibly years. Many almost certainly will make new homes in new places.
It is not the first time the United States has faced a mass internal migration: think of the ''Okies'' who fled the drought-ravaged Dust Bowl for fertile California in the 1930's, or Southern blacks who took the Delta blues to Chicago in the first half of the last century. 
 But the wreckage wrought by Katrina across the Gulf Coast is probably unprecedented in American history. No storm has matched the depth and breadth of its devastation. And the two disasters that demolished major cities -- the Chicago fire of 1871 and the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 -- occurred when the federal government lacked the resources and agencies to help the displaced. They offer few clues about how to aid and comfort Katrina's victims. 
 For that reason, many experts say, the federal government should look for long-term strategies among the groups that have resettled millions of refugees from those faraway storm-tossed or war-ravaged places -- two million of them here in the United States since 1975.
 ''These groups have a different way of seeing the problem: that it's not just short-term emergency relief,'' said Roberta Cohen, an expert on refugees at the Brookings Institution who helped write guidelines on aiding internally displaced people for the United Nations. 
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency has welcomed some help from agencies that specialize in disaster relief overseas, including the United Nations and the United States Agency for International Development. 
 But despite Katrina's magnitude, FEMA officials say their approach to resettling evacuees is not likely to differ significantly from the approach here to past disasters. They have ordered 100,000 trailers and mobile homes that will be placed in ''trailer cities'' in Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi. They have begun finding short-term apartments in Houston and Baton Rouge. And the Red Cross and other aid groups plan to provide psychological counseling and housing assistance at its temporary shelters. 
 ''This is larger, but the process is the same,'' said James McIntyre, a FEMA spokesman.
 Experts in refugee resettlement say the old ways might not be enough. Thousands of the New Orleans evacuees were poor or elderly; many were on welfare or have limited job skills. Many have been sent far from family and friends. Meeting their needs, and rebuilding the shattered Gulf Coast cities, will take a far more long-term and comprehensive plan, those experts say. 
 ''The approach now is very ad hoc,'' said Mark Franken, executive director of migration and refugee services for the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. ''They are moving people from one temporary environment to another.''
 Mr. Franken said nine resettlement organizations had proposed re-creating their refugee services for evacuees: finding jobs and long-term independent housing, acclimating people to new communities and providing careful case management that lasts months. The Bush administration is still reviewing that proposal, he said. The administration, he added, said groups should be prepared to care for half a million evacuees. 
 Other experts contend that the federal government should create a large-scale public works program to employ evacuees, possibly in rebuilding New Orleans itself. Gene Dewey, who retired in June as the assistant secretary of state for population, refugees and migration, said one model, as far-fetched as it sounds, might be the Afghan Civilian Conservation Corps -- named after the Depression-era program started by President Franklin D. Roosevelt -- that the Bush administration created in Afghanistan in 2003. By paying returnees to build roads, plant trees and restore schools, the program provided dignity as well as money, Mr. Dewey said.
 ''This is a time when you need that kind of Franklin Roosevelt thinking,'' he said.
 Hugh Parmer, who worked for the United States Agency for International Development in the 1990's and who has advised federal officials on a post-Katrina strategy, said the Kosovo crisis of 1999 taught him that the most humane way to resettle refugees was to avoid placing them in large shelters or camps. 
 Mr. Parmer added that the organization he currently leads, the American Refugee Committee International, plans to open mobile health clinics in Louisiana this week. It will be the first time the group, founded in 1979 to assist Southeast Asian refugees, has done work inside the United States.
 ''We run six mobile clinics in Darfur, and we've been joking that we're going to move the Sudan model to southern Louisiana,'' Mr. Parmer said.
 Julia Taft, who directed a Ford administration task force that oversaw the resettlement of 131,000 Southeast Asian refugees in the United States in 1975, said religious groups and private relief agencies were able to resettle those refugees in nine months because they had a vast network of volunteers, churches and synagogues. 
 ''What we need to do is treat them like refugees,'' Ms. Taft said of the hurricane's victims. ''We've got to recognize that they are going to be displaced for a significant period of time.''
 Some people, most prominently the Rev. Jesse Jackson, have objected to calling the storm victims refugees, asserting that the word is inappropriate and even racist. Under international law, refugees are defined as people who cross national borders to flee persecution. 
 Ms. Cohen of the Brookings Institution said the evacuees from the Gulf Coast fit neatly into a newer category: ''internally displaced persons.'' In the 1990's, when the end of the cold war and the dissolution of the Soviet Union led to ethnic strife and civil war across the Balkans and sub-Saharan Africa, the term was popularized by aid workers who contended that Western nations should intervene, with force if necessary, when governments failed to help large numbers of displaced people. 
 The United States, thanks to its resources, has largely been spared such dislocations. But not completely. The Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 may have displaced more than half a million people. The San Francisco earthquake of 1906 displaced more than 200,000 people. The Chicago fire of 1871 left 100,000 residents, a third of the city, homeless.
 Donald L. Miller, professor of history at Lafayette College in Pennsylvania and author of ''City of the Century: The Epic of Chicago and the Making of America,'' said the 1871 fire, like Katrina, had a sudden and catastrophic impact, particularly on poor Irish immigrants. 
 The federal government dispatched troops to keep order, but offered little direct assistance to victims. Churches, charities and business groups tried to fill the vacuum, but most of the displaced drifted into tent cities and shantytowns to fend for themselves, Professor Miller said.
 But if the fire offers few clear tips on how government should respond to Katrina, he said, it is instructive in one way: many of the evacuees stayed close to Chicago and helped rebuild it. By the late 1880's, it was the fifth-largest city in the world, a commercial hub and birthplace of a new, more muscular -- and more fireproof -- architecture. 
 ''I don't understand the despair regarding New Orleans,'' he said. ''We rebuilt Chicago. We rebuilt Berlin and Tokyo. We can do it again.''

HEADLINE: Taking Courses to Get an Edge But Without Getting a Degree 

BYLINE: By COELI CARR

 BODY:
The love of art had been a thread running through all of Honey Rodman's personal and professional life. She began her career as a teacher, and taught sculpture, painting and illustration to junior high students in New York for 16 years. Later, while working as a vice president at Time Warner, she and her husband, Jerome Brownstein, delighted in foraging for and buying antiques. 
 When Ms. Rodman's husband died almost three years ago, she again turned to art, this time for solace. She immersed herself in sculpture and made glass beads for her jewelry projects. Then, while researching a program in art therapy she was considering taking at New York University, she stumbled onto another possibility. 
 ''Here was this thing I was always interested in my whole life, and it wasn't going to cost me a million dollars,'' said Ms. Rodman, describing the certificate program in appraisal studies in fine and decorative arts; she enrolled last February. 
 The program is one of 116 certificate programs offered through the School of Continuing and Professional Studies at N.Y.U. A certificate program generally consists of five or six courses that can usually be completed at night in about two years at a cost of several thousand dollars. The courses are offered for a flat fee and carry no credit toward a college degree.
 Ms. Rodman, 60, who is retired and lives on the Upper West Side, said her primary interest in the program was self-fulfillment. But after completing her courses -- she is planning to pursue an advanced certificate in a specialized area of appraisal -- she plans to make the field her new profession. She hopes to work in a prestigious auction house or apprentice with an appraiser. 
 Initially, she had concerns. ''My worry was, because it was a certificate and not a degree program, that it would be mediocre,'' she said. ''But here, the teachers are experts.'' And, she added, taking classes under the aegis of a university conveys a certain status that allows her to meet and question gallery owners or others in the field. 
 She is not the only one who finds that status appealing. People jockeying for position in a highly competitive marketplace are hoping that a certificate -- generally awarded after a student has taken and passed course exams -- will put them on the inside track for a promotion or even a new career.
 ''We've seen an uptick in certificate program enrollment in the past year,'' said Ken Brown, a spokesman for the school at N.Y.U. Mr. Brown added that interest in these programs was strong throughout the 1990's, then leveled off after the 9/11 attacks. With the economy picking up since then, he said, enrollment is rising as well.
 Tony Macari, assistant dean for business programs at the school, said that students got the best results by following a course of study that aligns with their expertise. 
 As an example, Mr. Macari said that a certified public accountant might find it easy to make the transition, through a certificate program, to forensic accounting -- skills that are in demand because of the current business focus on detecting fraudulent accounting. 
 But it may be naive to expect a certificate to open the door to a highly specialized new career, he said. ''I've had people during information sessions ask me, 'If I get this certificate in investment banking, can I become an investment banker?''' Certain jobs in sophisticated areas of finance are difficult to come by, he cautioned, even if a candidate has the right resume and an exceptional academic history. 
 Mr. Macari favors a realistic approach. ''A certificate is basically like saying to somebody, 'I'm looking for a change. I know the content, and I've put in all this effort to get there,''' he said. 
 Mr. Macari said his division got many ideas for new areas of study from adjunct professors ''who can identify areas where there's just not a good body of knowledge and content, such as corporate governance.'' Last year, his division introduced a much-requested certificate program in wealth management, and is adding new courses to it this year.
 The wealth management program attracts brokers, insurance agents and tax and accounting professionals who want to broaden their knowledge of alternative investments, like art, collectibles and real estate. 
 Joan Volpe, director of the Center for Professional Studies at the Fashion Institute of Technology, which also offers certificate programs, encourages students to become aware of underserved niches in the job market and to consider taking a certificate program in one of those areas. 
 She cites fashion events planning, a career virtually unheard-of two decades ago, or opportunities in retail store management. The institute has certificate programs for each. The certificate, she said, ''helps establish a proficiency in a very specific niche,'' often one that has yet to become mainstream.
 In addition to getting you into the game, a certificate can help keep you in it. With more companies expecting employees to have expertise in more than one area, getting a certificate shows a worker's willingness to ''roll with the changes,'' said Therese A. Hoehne, director of human resources at Aurora University campuses in Aurora, Ill., and Lake Geneva, Wis. ''That they've positioned themselves for change says a lot'' to a prospective employer.
 But workers who hope to enroll in certificate programs at their employer's expense may find more restrictions than in the past. 
 As Mr. Macari said: ''Twenty years ago, it was, 'Take any course you want at an accredited college, and we'll pay for it.' Now, it's 'We want to see the course.' They want to make sure it's applicable to your job.''
 Susan R. Meisinger, president and chief executive of the Society for Human Resource Management in Alexandria, Va., said, ''It depends on the industry, and where the economy is on a particular industry. 
 ''Because technology changes so quickly, high-tech companies are much more likely to send folks out for certification. And in some industries, it's somewhat expected that a company will underwrite continued professional development.'' 
 Ms. Meisinger also sees some companies using continuing and professional education as retention tools. ''Younger workers are much more focused on their career and want to make sure they can develop in their career,'' she said.
 If an employer is reluctant to foot the bill for a certificate program, is it worthwhile for an employee to enroll at his own expense? 
 ''If it's a certificate program recognized in your field, absolutely,'' Ms. Meisinger said. ''People need to own their career and if it means paying your own way to continue to develop and learn, you should be doing that for your own long-term earning capability.
 ''Any credential that people can add to their quiver is added ammunition.''

HEADLINE: Where Steak and Sushi Coexist 

BYLINE: By JOANNE STARKEY

 BODY:
This place is a gold mine,'' said a man at the next table. Blackstone's prime Melville location in the Route 110 corridor does put it in an area in sore need of a good restaurant. And Blackstone, a new steakhouse, is scheduled to begin serving lunch on Monday, a bonanza for people who do business in the area. 
 But Blackstone has a lot more going for it than proximity to prospective diners. It also has a pedigree. It is owned by Boulder Creek Ventures, which is behind Rothmann's in East Norwich, Burton & Doyle in Great Neck and the Sagamore Steak House in Syosset. 
The Melville restaurant has the same prime dry-aged steaks and striking good looks as its siblings, but it has something more: sushi. Yes, a steakhouse with sushi. We sampled it as an appetizer and found it exemplary. It will probably also be a draw for those who want a light business lunch.
 About those good looks: The room conjures up a Western lodge as might have been conceived by Frank Lloyd Wright, with stone walls and fireplace; wood beams, floors and columns; and hanging wrought-iron lighting fixtures. Booths are done in black leather and a bold black and white primitive animal print, and chairs are upholstered in black fabric with thin white stripes. 
 Service was attentive and knowing. We had very few quibbles. One night our waiter forgot to ask which sauces we would like with our steaks, and we received none. (On another night, the bearnaise was commendable.) Our waitress that second night needed a primer on dividing the porterhouse for two. She sparked a near riot at our table when she gave all the tenderloin to one diner. 
 And those steaks (each $38) are worth fighting over. I sampled every steak on the menu and found consistent cooking, very tender meat and marvelously seasoned crusts. The 28-ounce rib-eye was my favorite, the best I've had in years.
 Fish lovers have a good choice in the delicate and flaky pan-seared red snapper. It was given an Asian spin with the accompanying Japanese eggplant sauteed with garlic, sake, red miso and sesame oil.
 Another hit was the rack of lamb with a flavorful crust and winning ragout of spinach, white beans, garlic and orecchiette. We were less impressed by the overorchestrated veal chop stuffed with braised chicken and wild mushrooms, topped with melted fontina cheese and served with braised escarole.
 Steaks, in true steakhouse fashion, arrived solo. The best of the side dishes ($6 to $8) were the perfectly seasoned and textured creamed spinach and the flavor-packed French fries presented in a paper cone. Brussels sprouts, halved and sauteed with lots of garlic, were another crowd pleaser. Mashed potatoes were standard issue; the hash browns less than that -- these fried half-moons mixed with sauteed onions had lost their crunch and had the texture of cardboard.
 The shrimp and crab cocktails were both fine, especially the lump crab. For a bit more pizazz, try the Mediterranean octopus salad: a toss of greens, very tender octopus, marinated zucchini, olives and a lemon vinaigrette with a garnish of grilled pita folded around a helping of hummus.
 The Caesar salad was an unorthodox delight. It included quarters of romaine in a zesty Caesar dressing with anchovies, a clump of marinated tomatoes and a toast spread with black-olive tapenade. The crab cake also hit all the right notes: a well-flavored, loosely packed disk set upon a sweet corn fondue.
 The Kobe beef appetizer, which cost $28 (twice the price of other appetizers), is a novelty number. The beef was sliced paper-thin and presented alongside a hot black river rock. The diner had to cook the beef and then dip it into the hoisin-soy sauce. The meat was as tender as expected, but paying $28 for less than two ounces of meat doesn't make economic sense, not when the marvelous 28-ounce rib-eye goes for $38. 
 There was a wide choice of desserts, ranging from a tangy lemon meringue tart to a fudgy truffle torte. We liked them all, especially the free-form rustic apple-raisin pie crowned with butter pecan ice cream, and the summer melon carpaccio. This tangle of cantaloupe and honeydew ribbons was topped with raspberry sorbet and a chewy sesame tuile. 
 There is no cheesecake on the menu, perhaps a Long Island steakhouse first.

HEADLINE: 800 Square Feet and Zero Energy Bills

BYLINE: By Marcelle S. Fischler. 
E-mail: lijournal@nytimes.com

 BODY:
TO design the perfect solar house, Heather Korb and her fellow architecture students at the New York Institute of Technology wanted to do more than just harness the sun with solar panels. 
 ''Our philosophy is to live in harmony with the earth as part of one sustainable ecology,'' said Ms. Korb, 26, of St. James, a fourth-year student at the institute's Old Westbury campus.
 Ms. Korb's run-by-the-sun design, called Green Machine/Blue Space, is not just a series of sketches or a scale model. 
 Since last spring, between classes, on weekends and all summer long, 70 students have been hammering and sawing, running wires and installing solar panels, turning the plans for an 800-square-foot house set at the edge of a parking lot into reality. 
 Remarkably, the contemporary-style house, clad in cedar, can be lived in without spending a penny on energy. Its regenerative hydrogen fuel-cell energy storage system means the house actually produces more electricity than it needs. David Schieren, 26, of Hewlett Harbor, a graduate student in engineering and the energy team leader on the project, said the challenge was to build a house ''that is energy self-sufficient.''
 The house, which cost $500,000 to construct, is the university's entry in the 2005 Solar Decathlon competition sponsored by the federal Department of Energy.
 The New York Institute of Technology is one of 19 colleges around the world, and the only one in the metropolitan region, to be selected as a finalist in the international competition. The college chose Ms.Korb's design after a weeklong design event in which four teams of students came up with ideas for a truly sustainable house. 
 At the end of this month, the house is to be broken down into seven sections, trucked to the Mall in Washington and reassembled for the three-week final competition. 
 Brainstorming with her teammates, Heather Castelli and Jason Dames, Ms. Korb designed an airy, light-filled house using recyclable materials and lessons for future housing design. A discarded shipping container became the heart of the house: the Green Machine, an 8-foot-by-20-foot space that resembles a trailer, houses the kitchen, bath and mechanical room. 
 ''It is economical and energy-efficient to reuse something,'' Ms. Korb said, noting the abundance of shipping containers that could be salvaged worldwide. ''The idea was to take all the mechanics of the house, anything that is heat-producing, and condense it into a smaller area, so that the living space is wide open.''
 A breezeway called the ''and'' helps provide natural ventilation and connects the container to the Blue Space, a combination living room, dining room and work area with a bedroom loft above. A two-tiered roof with wide overhangs shelters it all. 
 Windows stretch across the front of the house, with a line of clerestory windows on the balcony level. A bridge over the breezeway connects the balcony to the Green Machine's roof garden, where vegetables and herbs will be grown. Leftovers from the kitchen become compost; rainwater collected from the roof is used to water the plants. 
 During the day, advanced solar panels are the home's primary power source. But what happens at night and on cloudy days?
 ''We have to store energy,'' Mr. Schieren said. While other teams in the competition went the traditional route and used storage batteries, the institute's students chose a hydrogen fuel-cell energy storage system instead. 
 When the sun shines, electricity generated by the roof-mounted photovoltaic system -- the solar panels -- is put to work separating hydrogen from water by electrolysis, Mr. Schieren said. The hydrogen, stored in tanks, can be drawn on to power a fuel cell, providing electricity and heat on demand day or night, summer or winter. 
 ''Hydrogen is the fuel of the future, and it offers true energy independence and the opportunity for a clean environment,'' he added. ''We don't need natural gas, we don't need an oil tank, we are not connected to the grid. We are working on the future, the home of the future.'' Not to mention utility bills kept at a comfortable zero dollars. 
 Richard M. Kessel, chairman of the Long Island Power Authority, said more than 500 homes on the Island were using solar power in some form. And the timing could not be better, he said, for the students' efforts. 
 ''We are just at the beginning of an energy tsunami,'' Mr. Kessel said, citing the skyrocketing prices for oil and natural gas and the threat they pose to the Island's economy. ''The answer in the long run is to reduce our dependence on oil and other fossil fuels, through efforts like this solar house and renewable energy resources.'' 
 There are many financial incentives for solar pioneers. Mr. Kessel said LIPA offers rebates to customers who install solar energy systems on their roofs. New York State offers tax credits, and recently exempted solar equipment from state sales tax. The Suffolk County executive, Steve Levy, recently proposed legislation that would spare homeowners from county sales tax on the systems as well. 
 ''The future is now for solar energy,'' Mr. Kessel added. ''I don't believe that solar energy or fuel cells or wind power are a luxury anymore. They are a necessity.'' 
 Michael Catalano, 23, a fifth-year architecture student from Islip Terrace, led the team in charge of the Green Machine. He said the energy-efficient design principles could be used on much larger homes. 
 ''Our goal is to demonstrate a different way of living, but applying it to what people value,'' Mr. Catalano said. 
 The house's eco-friendly ideas extend beyond energy. The kitchen counter is made from compressed newsprint. The insulation protecting the walls of the container is made of a soy-based foam. In the leisure areas, walls eight inches thick are made from Agriboard, a wallboard made of compressed wheat straw. 
 ''The straw releases a natural adhesive, so these walls are completely biodegradable,'' Ms. Korb said. ''When the house is finished, you can grind it up and leave it for mulch, and it just goes back to the earth.'' Not for a while yet, though: when the competition is over, it will be reassembled on campus for use as a solar educational center.
 While architecture students worked on the overall design and engineers labored over the energy plan, interior-design students considered self-sufficiency and sustainability in their plans. The sofa, for instance, has photovoltaic panels on the back that can collect enough energy to power two lamps connected to the sofa's frame, or drive small fans for heating and cooling embedded in its cushions.
 Alexandra Logue, vice president for academic affairs and provost of the college, said the competition was unusual in requiring students from different disciplines to work together, applying classroom learning to a real-life project. 
 ''They are doing it with something that is important for our society: how to harness the power of the sun to provide energy for an entire house,'' Dr. Logue said.
 Ms. Korb said the Green Machine/Blue Space was her dream.
 ''I'd love to live in a house that is not connected to the grid or any pipelines,'' she said. ''You just don't have to take from the government or from the local power supply. You are producing your own, along with the sun and the earth. It's a nice feeling.'' 

Saved From the Dumpster
 Two years after Barrie and John Overend moved from an apartment in Manhattan to a house in Garden City, they still had boxes in the basement that they hadn't unpacked.
 Many of the knickknacks were things that John, 41, had grown up with; other boxes came from Ms. Overend's parents' basement or from her office. Some of the keepsakes had been on display in their previous apartments. 
 ''Once we boxed things up, we realized we wanted to decorate a different way,'' said Ms. Overend, 38. ''A lot of things we decorate with now, we collected together.''
 Hoping to get rid of the clutter and fix up the basement as a play area for their children, Nathan, 8, and Addie, 4, and as a workout space for herself and her husband, Ms. Overend responded to an ad in a local weekly newspaper seeking homeowners with antiques to sell.
 The following day, she received a call from the producers of ''Cash in the Attic,'' a new weekly program on the HGTV cable television network. The program, a twist on the typical appraisal show, takes families on a treasure hunt through their own homes, finding forgotten heirlooms that can be sold at auction to finance home improvements. It has its premiere Monday at 8 p.m.; the Overends are featured in the first segment. 
 ''We recycle clothes, bottles, cans,'' Ms. Overend said. ''The thought of recycling household items is also neat.''
 John Scencio, the program's host, and Tim Luke, an appraiser, helped the couple select pewter pitchers, wooden bookends, a Mickey Mouse phone and a Victorian wooden writing slope that could be liquidated. An old medicine cabinet and an antique desk that Mr. Overend used as a child were also packed into the ''Cash in the Attic'' van and taken to an auction house in Westchester.
 But Mr. Overend, a real estate developer, decided that a walking stick with a silver knob that his parents had collected and a painting of a windmill that had hung in his boyhood room had more sentimental than monetary value. They never made it to the auction block. 
 As it worked out, they didn't have to: The other items fetched a total of $2,400 at auction, more than enough to pay for the Overends' basement makeover, including a new treadmill. 
 ''He is the one that is all sentimental,'' Ms. Overend said of her husband. ''I am the one that is giddy and happy and wants to get rid of everything.''

HEADLINE: Among the Believers

BYLINE: By A.O. Scott. 
A.O. Scott is a film critic at The New York Times.

 BODY:
Benjamin Kunkel's first novel, ''Indecision,'' published last month, concerns a young man living in Manhattan and trying, as the title suggests, to figure out what to do with his life. He has a B.A. in philosophy and an active, if confusing, romantic life; he gets by on a combination of office work and parental subsidy. In his author's affectionate estimation, offered over a beer on a recent evening at a Brooklyn bar, this young man, whose name is Dwight Wilmerding, is ''kind of an idiot.'' Perhaps, but he may also be -- the critical response to ''Indecision'' suggests as much -- an especially representative kind of idiot. His plight, after all, is -- for people of his age and background -- a familiar one: an alienation from his own experience brought about by too much knowledge, too many easy, inconsequential choices, too much self-consciousness. Bred in a culture consecrated to the entitled primacy of the individual, he discovers that he lacks a self, a coherent identity, maybe a soul. He feels that he could be anyone. ''It wasn't very unusual for me to lie awake at night,'' he confesses, ''feeling like a scrap of sociology blown into its designated corner of the world. But knowing the cliches are cliches doesn't help you to escape them. You still have to go on experiencing your experience as if no one else has ever done it.'' 
Of course, one aspect of that experience is the impulse to rebel against it -- the desire to rescue thought, feeling and ambition from the quotation marks that seem perpetually affixed to them, to recover the possibility of earnest emotion, ethical commitment and serious thought. That desire can find any number of outlets, one of which might be -- why not? -- starting a literary journal, a small magazine. 
 ''You'd better mean something enough to live by it,'' Kunkel told me, echoing both his fictional creation and, as it happens, one of his comrades in another literary enterprise. On the last page of the first issue of n+1, a little magazine that made its debut last year, the reader learns that ''it is time to say what you mean.'' The author of that declaration, a forceful variation on some of Dwight Wilmerding's more tentative complaints, is Keith Gessen, who edits n+1 along with Kunkel, Mark Greif and Marco Roth. All four editors are around Dwight's age -- he's 28 when the main action in the book takes place; they're 30 or a little older. Like him, they often glance anxiously and a bit nostalgically backward to a pre-9/11, pre-Florida-recount moment that seems freer and more irresponsible than the present. You wouldn't, however, call any of them any kind of idiot. Nor, based on their pointed, closely argued and often brilliantly original critiques of contemporary life and letters, would you accuse them of indecision, though they do sometimes display a certain pained 21st-century ambivalence about the culture they inhabit.
 N+1 is not the first small magazine to come out of this ambivalence or the first to have its mission encapsulated by a memoiristic account of the attempt to figure out one's life. Consider the following scrap of dialogue from Dave Eggers's ''Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,'' famously hailed as the manifesto of a slightly earlier generational moment: 
 ''And how will you do this?'' she wants to know. ''A political party? A march? A revolution? A coup?''
 ''A magazine.'' 
 Eggers is talking about an old (in fact, a defunct) magazine called Might, but never mind. Even with a bit of historical distance -- five years after the book's publication, a decade and more after the events it describes -- these lines capture both a moment and the general spirit of the magazine-starting enterprise. A bunch of ambitious, like-minded young friends get together to assemble pictures and words into a sensibility -- a voice, a look, an attitude -- that they hope will resonate beyond their immediate circle. Eventually, as in most versions of this kind of story, they run out of money and energy and move on to other things. In Eggers's case, those other things included other magazines, as Might begat McSweeney's, a typographically adventurous literary quarterly, which in turn begat The Believer, an illustrated monthly whose design was conceived by Eggers and that is edited by Vendela Vida (to whom he is married), Heidi Julavits and Ed Park.
 At a time when older forms of media are supposedly being swallowed up by newer ones, the impulse to start the kind of magazine Partisan Review was in the late 1930's or The Paris Review was in the 50's might look contrarian, even reactionary. If you are an overeducated (or at least a semi-overeducated) youngish person with a sleep disorder and a surfeit of opinions, the thing to do, after all, is to start a blog. There are no printing costs, no mailing lists, and the medium offers instant membership in a welcoming herd of independent minds who will put you in their links columns if you put them in yours. Blogs embody and perpetuate a discourse based on speed, topicality, cleverness and contention -- all qualities very much ascendant in American media culture these days. To start a little magazine, then -- to commit yourself to making an immutable, finite set of perfect-bound pages that will appear, typos and all, every month or two, or six, or whenever, even if you are also, and of necessity, maintaining an affiliated Web site, to say nothing of holding down a day job or sweating over a dissertation -- is, at least in part, to lodge a protest against the tyranny of timeliness. It is to opt for slowness, for rumination, for patience and for length. It is to defend the possibility of seriousness against the glibness and superficiality of the age -- and also, of course, against other magazines.
 These, at least, seem to be among the ambitions driving The Believer and n+1. Their editors are young, and their circulations are not large. (It may, indeed, be hard to find these publications outside of independent bookstores in larger cities and college towns.) The names of the writers who contribute to them are, for the most part, not well known: first- or second-time novelists, graduate students and moonlighting academic mavericks, with an occasional celebrity professor or foreign writer thrown in for good measure. Modest though the magazines are in scale and appearance, there is nonetheless something stirringly immodest -- something ''authentic and delirious,'' as e.e. cummings once wrote -- about what they are trying to do, which is to organize a generational struggle against laziness and cynicism, to raise once again the banners of creative enthusiasm and intellectual engagement.
 In some ways, The Believer and n +1 represent sensibilities as distinct as their names. The Believer, which was going to be called The Optimist, puts out a welcome mat for pluralism and wide-eyed curiosity, while n+1 surveys contemporary culture through eyes narrowed by skepticism. Nonetheless, there is much that they share, notably a pointedly cosmopolitan frame of reference and an eclectic internationalism that embraces -- or, rather, defiantly refuses to disown -- European thinkers (the Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben, the Slovenian mischief-maker Slavoj Zizek) and novelists (the scandalous Michel Houellebecq, whose recent study of H.P. Lovecraft was published by The Believer's nascent book imprint, and the Spaniard Javier Marias, who publishes a monthly column called ''La Zona Fantasma'' in the magazine). The magazines themselves feel decidedly youthful, not only in their characteristic generational concerns -- the habit of nonchalantly blending pop culture, literary esoterica and academic theory, for instance, or the unnerving ability to appear at once mocking and sincere -- but also in the sense of bravado and grievance that ripples through their pages. 
 In addition to interviews with philosophers, writers, filmmakers, indie-rock musicians, a professional ninja and anyone else willing to sit down for a long, meandering conversation, The Believer publishes page-long appreciations of books, children, motels, light bulbs and power tools and two-page schematics devoted to things like singing drummers and fictional presidents. Mostly, though, it publishes long essays with enigmatic titles, each one prefaced by a list enumerating matters to be ''discussed.'' For example, from the August 2005 issue, an article by Tony Perrottet called ''The Semen of Hercules'' promises discussion of, among other things, ''The Kentucky Derby, Philostratus. . .Pharmaceutical Use of Squeezed Mustard-Rocket Leaf, Guaranteed Sexual Attractiveness. . .and Ancient Fad Diets.'' 
 The lists suggest digression, surprise and a willingness to explore tangents and not be bound by strictly linear presentation. The typical Believer essay -- to the extent that such a thing can exist, given the magazine's commitment to the idiosyncrasy and multiplicity of voices -- ranges and explores, collecting curiosities and offhand insights on its way to an argument and taking as much time, and as many words, as it needs. This formal elasticity is central to The Believer's critique of other magazines and the speeded-up, superficial culture of reading they sustain. 
 ''It would be easier to say what we saw didn't exist than to say what we wanted to exist,'' Heidi Julavits told me recently. ''As a writer and a reader, it felt like topic, topic, topic, topic was this constant refrain. You could never get away from the topic.'' 
 And the topic often seemed to be the same. ''The vast majority of magazines in the United States tell you exactly the same thing at the same time,'' Vendela Vida said not long ago by telephone from San Francisco, where she lives and where The Believer is published (though two of its editors, Park and Julavits, live most of the time in New York). ''We'd all apparently entered into this agreement that every month we'd be interested in the same thing'' -- the upcoming movies, novels, recordings and television shows. 
 But, of course, in spite of an elaborate machinery devoted to synchronizing and standardizing cultural consumption -- of which magazines are an important part -- most people's habits remain blessedly out of synch. We buy battered paperbacks at yard sales, stumble across movies on cable late at night and hear strange music on our friends' mix tapes (an experience apotheosized by Rick Moody's article about a Christian indie-rock group, the Danielson Famile, in the recent music issue). Part of The Believer's mission is to capture this aesthetic of mixing and matching, swapping and rediscovering. The message of a given issue seems to be, Hey, look at all this neat stuff -- or, as Julavits puts it, ''Isn't this amazing?'' Philosophers and musicians, the M.L.A., the W.N.B.A., the U.L.A. (that's Underground Literary Alliance), Tintin and a strange 19th-century Southern novel called ''The Story of Don Miff'' all receive generous, thoughtful scrutiny, for their own sakes and for their interconnections.
 ''There has to be an element that reflects how we live and how we read,'' Vida told me. ''We don't just run out and buy the new novel or start thinking about Darwinism just because George Bush happened to say something about it.'' And so The Believer's content is often as pointedly untimely as its approach is digressive. Some of its best articles dust off the reputations of half-forgotten writers and historical characters -- Charles Portis, John Hawkes, Ignatius Donnelly -- and the interviews, with the very, the semi-and the narrowly famous, range far beyond the usual plugging of the latest projects. ''In October we have David Sedaris talking mostly about monkeys,'' Vida said. ''What makes it timely is its untimeliness.''
 The Believer grew out of the blending of two different ideas -- an interview magazine Vida and Eggers were discussing and a book review Julavits was interested in starting. The magazine, which made its debut in March 2003 and has just published its 27th issue, is older than n+1, which is on its third. It is also larger, both in trim size (an eccentric, pleasing-to-hold 8* by 10 inches, compared with n+1's more orthodox and bookish 7 by 10) and in circulation. The Believer prints around 15,000 copies of its regular issues, and more of its special issues devoted to music and visual art, while n+1, having sold out its 2,000-copy first issue, has increased its run with every subsequent issue. Though The Believer pays its writers -- the going rate is $500 for a long essay -- and its managing editor, Andrew Leland, everyone else associated with each of the publications essentially works for free.
 Vida, Julavits and Park all knew one another in the mid-90's at Columbia, where they all received M.F.A.'s in creative writing. Vida published ''Girls on the Verge,'' a journalistic look at female coming-of-age rituals, and then turned to fiction with her second book, ''And Now You Can Go.'' Julavits has published two novels, ''The Mineral Palace'' and ''The Effect of Living Backwards,'' while Park, in addition to his Believer duties, is a senior editor (and occasional film reviewer) at The Village Voice.
 The four editors of n+1 are also connected by shared sensibilities and school ties. Kunkel, who grew up in Colorado, went from Deep Springs College, a tiny, all-male school in the California desert devoted to the classical ideal of rigorous study in a pastoral setting, to Harvard, where he met Greif, though not Gessen, who was also there at the time. (Actually, they later discovered that they did have one brief encounter as undergraduates, about which Kunkel would say only that at least one of them was drunk and that one suggested the other should get a lobotomy.) Gessen, who lived in the Soviet Union until he was 6, was a football player at Harvard and went on to get an M.F.A. in fiction from Syracuse. Greif entered the Ph.D. program in American studies at Yale, where he met Roth, who had arrived via Oberlin and Columbia to pursue his doctorate in comparative literature. After talking about it for years -- another friend from Harvard, Chad Harbach, who edits the n+1 Web site, thought of the name back in 1998 -- they decided the moment was right to put their ideas and aspirations into print.
 One afternoon in July, I wandered over to n+1's offices -- that is, to the apartment near the Brooklyn Museum that Keith Gessen shares with two roommates -- to watch Allison Lorentzen, the managing editor, assorted staff members, friends and interns coax the third issue toward production. As the editors entered data into their subscription lists, pausing now and then to munch on a baby carrot or a morsel of rugelach, we chatted about a variety of topics, many of which happened to be other, older little magazines -- Politics, Partisan Review, Dissent -- and the legendary figures who wrote for them. The air was so thick with Lionel Trilling, Edmund Wilson, Hannah Arendt and Dwight Macdonald that Gessen later sent me an e-mail message hoping to correct the impression that all he and his colleagues ever talked about were the public intellectuals of the past. ''Left to our own devices, we also talk about rock 'n' roll music,'' he said.
 Well, yes, of course. Mark Greif's essay on Radiohead in the new issue -- subtitled ''The Philosophy of Pop'' -- certainly proves as much. Still, their own enterprise is steeped in an awareness of what past journals and small magazines have been and failed to be -- not only ancient specimens like T.S. Eliot's Criterion, which was the subject of Gessen's honors thesis at Harvard, but also newer models. 
 A few days later, in a Lower East Side cafe on an afternoon so hot that only a true intellectual would think to order a pot of tea, Greif laid out the immediate prehistory of n+1 -- what a certain kind of historian might call its conditions of possibility. ''In order to start this thing you have to feel there's a kind of historical necessity,'' he said. The history of small magazines has been, to some extent, a history of grand intellectual, artistic and political movements, for which even the tiniest publications have served as incubators and laboratories. They have sometimes functioned as a vanguard (as Irving Kristol's Public Interest did with the disgruntled liberalism that would blossom into neoconservatism) and sometimes as a way of keeping unfashionable ideas alive in difficult times (as Dissent, which started at the vanguard of democratic socialism in the 1950's, has done pretty much ever since). Partisan Review, whose demise Gessen cites, only semi-facetiously, as a pretext for the founding of n+1, is everyone's favorite example of both. After freeing itself from the Communist Party in the mid-1930's, it took up the banner of the anti-Stalinist left, a flag which, after World War II, took on the colors of international literary modernism. Though it published some of the postwar period's most eminent novelists and poets, Partisan Review is best remembered as a vehicle for a kind of cultural criticism that was, at its best, politically engaged without being narrowly ideological and discriminating without being precious or snobbish. 
 The need for this kind of writing never goes away, even though its extinction always seems imminent. ''Coming out of college, it felt like there were people who were really going to be there for you,'' Greif said, referring to the journals and Webzines that seemed to be flourishing in the late 90's, including The Baffler, McSweeney's, Lingua Franca and Feed. ''Then three things happened. The Internet economy burst'' -- taking with it some of the most interesting Web-based publications -- ''and you discovered that these things, which had been the intellectual hope of a generation, were based on venture capital. Then Lingua Franca'' -- the ''review of academic life'' that existed from 1990 to 2001 -- ''went bust.'' McSweeney's, though it survived, turned out to be, in Greif's opinion, a bit of a letdown, because of its mannered quirkiness and what he calls its ''orientation to childhood.'' 
 From each of these disappointments, he said, a lesson could be drawn. The first was that ''it doesn't matter if you have money, and you're better off without it.'' (N+1 was started with small sums from the pockets of its editors. It sells a few pages of advertisements in each issue and recently received a modest infusion of cash -- some $8,000 from a fund-raiser.) The second lesson was ''take what you can from the academy,'' but without getting bogged down in pedantry or academic politics. (Thus n+1's frequent and unapologetic references to literary theory and continental philosophy, presented in language free of jargon and ideological posturing.) Finally, there was a renewed belief in the importance of debate, a desire, as Grief put it, ''to convince people that arguing about things could be impersonal, because it advances thought.''
 And n+1 is explicitly and without embarrassment devoted to the idea that thought can advance. ''The idea of progress is not uncomfortable to us,'' they declare in the ''preamble'' to their inaugural issue. ''Who will drive progress? To every tradition, and every art, and aspect of culture, and line of thought, a step is added. This dream of advance in every human endeavor, in line with what we need, not just what we're capable of, is futurism humanized. It is wanted in a time of repetition. It is needed whenever authorities declare an end to history. It is desperate when the future we are offered is the outcome of technology.''
 Somewhat more mundanely, the magazine exists to present work by its editors -- and by like-minded writers who discover n+1through word of mouth or Web browsing -- that might not have a chance of appearing elsewhere. Gessen regularly reviews books for New York magazine, and both he and Kunkel have published in The New York Review of Books. Greif remains on the masthead at The American Prospect, where he worked for a year. But, Kunkel said, ''the most exciting pieces that have been published in the magazine'' -- he cites Greif's ''Against Exercise,'' Roth's ''Last Cigarettes,'' and a forthcoming short (and unsigned) article about dating -- ''could not have appeared anywhere else. For generic reasons, and for their untimeliness. There's a tendency to ghettoize things that are important to us -- there's fiction, there's essays and criticism, there's politics -- and you can go and find journals about each of these things, but you can't go and find journals about all of those things.''
 Gessen said much the same thing to me on yet another hot afternoon, in a falafel joint in another part of Brooklyn: ''Here I am with all this fiction no one would want to publish, and here's Mark with these essays no one's going to publish, and after a while we felt like we had this critical mass of stuff that nobody would want to publish.'' Until, that is, they did so themselves, after which things changed -- a little. Harper's reprinted ''Against Exercise,'' which was also selected for ''Best American Essays 2005,'' and Marco Roth's ''Derrida: An Autothanatography,'' first published on the n+1 Web site, was reprinted in The Boston Globe. (Kunkel, meanwhile, has become the hot young white male writer of the moment, a position once held by Dave Eggers. Now is probably the time to disclose that Kunkel's literary agent, who was once Eggers's, is also mine.)
 ''Against Exercise,'' written in the lofty, epigrammatic and mischievously funny style that is Greif's hallmark (and that does not usually find favor with dissertation committees), interrogates the bizarre, soul-emptying mixture of hedonism and self-punishment that characterizes rituals of fitness. Roth's valediction to the French philosopher who was, for decades, both a hero and a scapegoat in American intellectual life, is a mixture of homage, memoir and iconoclasm, as good an account as any of the seductions and the limitations of theory. Those articles hint at some key aspects of the magazine's identity. They show, first of all, a willingness to scramble conventional ideas of genre, mixing criticism, personal essay, fiction and philosophical argument and applying the resulting hybrid to matters both mundane (dating, going to the gym, smoking) and lofty (the meaning of life, the nature of war). Other essays achieve similar blendings of voice, style and genre. Elif Batuman's ''Babel in California,'' the longest article in the second issue, is an inquiry into the tragic, enigmatic life of the great Russian-Jewish writer Isaac Babel wrapped in a comic novel of academic manners -- using real names, no less -- that would make Mary McCarthy proud (and also jealous). Gessen's short story ''The Vice President's Daughter'' is as much an essay on the delusions and smashed hopes of Clinton-era college students as it is a work of fiction. Kunkel's ''Diana Abbott: A Lesson,'' for its part, is an essay on the South African novelist J.M. Coetzee in the form of a fictional narrative about a young book reviewer's struggle to come to terms with his work.
 Such eclecticism is not an end in itself, and the experimental brio of the writing coexists with a regard for aesthetic distinctions, intellectual standards and even cultural hierarchies that can look downright conservative.''I love it when we're mistaken for a conservative journal of opinion,'' Mark Greif said -- though the actual political views presented in n+1 tend to range from mildly to ardently left-wing. Their youthful gusto is accompanied by a sense of weary impatience -- with the mindless celebration of popular culture, with the coyness of some of their literary peers and rivals and with ignorance of history and tradition on the part of those who should know better. William F. Buckley Jr., founder of National Review, perhaps the most influential magazine of the past half-century, famously defined a conservative as someone who ''stands athwart history, yelling Stop,'' a description curiously echoed in the last words on the last page of the first issue of n+1: ''We've begun by saying, No. Enough.'' 
 And it does often seem that way. The reader of n+1 discovers what the magazine is for by grasping what it is against, which is not only exercise but also, in no small part, other magazines -- including, as it happens, The Believer. In the first issue, in a section they proudly and cheekily call ''The Intellectual Situation'' (the intellectual in question being a footloose, self-ironizing composite of Greif, Gessen, Kunkel and Roth), the editors comb through the mail, tossing The Believer onto a pile with The New Republic and The Weekly Standard. Expressing the ambivalence about Dave Eggers and ''the Eggersards'' that may be the defining trait of this latest generation (it is, at this point, almost impossible to distinguish hero worship from backlash), they note that The Believer ''presents their version of thinking -- as an antidote to mainstream criticism, which they call snarkiness.'' N+1 responds: ''Mere belief is hostile to the whole idea of thinking. To wear credulity as one's badge of intellect is not to be a thinker as such.''
 That is well put, but also a bit wide of the mark, and it overstates the differences between the two magazines. The Believer, in spite of its commitment to enthusiasm, is about something more than ''mere belief,'' and n+1, for its part, fiercely broadcasts its own faith -- in transcendence, in literature and in a curiously disembodied activity called ''thought.'' In the latest installment of ''The Intellectual Situation,'' a short essay called ''The Reading Crisis'' examines some of the oft-diagnosed symptoms of literature's ill health, from slumping book sales to the cancellation of Oprah's Book Club, and finds many of the proposed remedies -- including Believerish hostility to hostile reviews -- to be worse than the disease. And yet they also have, in the past, expressed their own reservations about negativity, scolding The New Republic's James Wood for his uncharitable reviews of modern novelists and suppressing a withering addendum to ''The Reading Crisis'' dealing with Jonathan Safran Foer. Their ringing, programmatic insistence on progress -- ''to those who insist the series is at an end, we say: n+1'' -- can sound an awful lot like The Believer's defiant optimism. And Gessen's declaration, on the last page of the first issue, that ''it is time to say what you mean,'' chimes with The Believer's stance against what Julavits calls ''high irony.''
 The Believer, after all, came into being in opposition to what Eggers and Julavits perceived as the snide, vituperative state of book reviewing, a disorder diagnosed by Julavits, in the first-issue article that served more or less as a manifesto, as ''snark.'' It was a wide-ranging complaint against the superficiality and dismissiveness that she and her friends believed was undermining literary discussion. ''We were tired of seeing the same thing every month'' was how Vendela Vida put it to me. ''Reviews of the big new book that all say the same thing: don't read it.''
 Julavits made a similar point a few weeks ago. We were sitting in her skylighted living room on an unusually hot day in a part of Maine where it sometimes seems that you can't swing a dead lobster without hitting a rusticating writer of one kind or another. Like Mark Greif, she responded to the heat with hot tea. ''I really saw 'the end of the book' as originating in the way books are talked about now in our culture and especially in the most esteemed venues for book criticism. It seemed as though their irrelevance was a foregone conclusion, and we were just practicing this quaint exercise of pretending something mattered when of course everyone knew it didn't.''
 Her frustration, it seems, is not so much with book reviewing as such but with everything that conspires to trivialize literary discourse and to prevent books -- and not only books but also music, movies, opinions, utopian dreams -- from being taken seriously. Like the editors of n+1, she and her colleagues speak a language that is not only literary but unapologetically highbrow, less in its choice of objects than in the way it perceives them. The Believer is happy to write about pop songs or reality television, to make jokes and indulge in whimsy, but it tends to disdain the nonchalant, knowing sarcasm that has become, elsewhere, the dominant form of cleverness.
 In the end, this may be the common ground n+1 and The Believer occupy: a demand for seriousness that cuts against ingrained generational habits of flippancy and prankishness. Their differences are differences of emphasis and style -- and the failings that each may find in the other (or that even a sympathetic reader may find in both) come from their deep investments in voice, stance and attitude rather than in a particular set of ideas or positions. For The Believer, the way to take things seriously is to care about them -- ''to endow something with importance,'' in Julavits's words, ''by treating it as an emotional experience.'' And this can lead, at times, to the credulous, seemingly disingenuous naivete that Greif finds infantile. For n+1, the index of seriousness is thought for its own sake, which can sanction an especially highhanded form of intellectual arrogance. But, of course, this distinction, between a party of ardor and a party of rigor, is itself too schematic, since The Believer, at its best, is nothing if not thoughtful, and n+1 frequently wears its passions on its sleeve.
 Their arguments are likely to continue, and then, eventually, to cool, as the journals themselves turn into institutions or fade into oblivion. Either way, they will serve as incitements to future projects -- whether as lost possibilities in need of revival or missed opportunities in need of correction. In the meantime, what they provide is space -- room for the exploration of hunches, experiments, blind alleys and starry-eyed hopes, by readers and writers whose small numbers can be a source of pride. Surveying the political scene in the wake of the last election, Kunkel took some solace in the idea that ''our lives remain their own great cause.'' And if not, then perhaps our magazines will.

HEADLINE: In Macao, Giant Pleasure Domes Are Decreed

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

 BODY:
IT is 3 a.m. on a humid Sunday in Macao in late July, and hundreds of people, most of them Chinese, are still filing into the gigantic new Sands Macao hotel and casino, making their way up the escalator to the building's main gallery.
 Under a 100,000-pound chandelier, on a carpeted floor nearly three times the size of a football field, people stand shoulder to shoulder around the baccarat tables, gambling the hours away.
 Across the Avenida de Amizade, a sprawling theme park called Fisherman's Wharf is going up; the neon lights from the Sands illuminate such park features as an artificial 130-foot volcano that rises above a replica of the Roman Colosseum.
 Just a few blocks away, construction has begun on the Las Vegas tycoon Steve Wynn's $700 million hotel and casino project, the Wynn Macao, which is scheduled to open in 2006. In addition, Macao is awaiting the opening of a MGM Grand Paradise hotel and casino, and Stanley Ho, whose name has long been synonymous with gambling in Macao, is trying to update his own casino empire by building the Grand Lisboa on the Avenida Infante D. Henrique. 
 Perhaps the most stunning building projects are going on about four miles away, on what is called the Cotai Strip, Macao's expensive and hyperambitious answer to the Las Vegas Strip. By 2007, one of the world's largest and most extravagant building complexes, the Venetian Macau hotel and casino, is expected to open. 
 It's easy to see why Macao, a small island territory 37 miles southwest of Hong Kong, is already being called Asia's Las Vegas. 
 Over the last few years, Las Vegas and Hong Kong entrepreneurs have been promising to transform this tiny former Portuguese colony into the entertainment capital of Asia, full of Vegas style. They have already earmarked billions of dollars to invest in dozens of new hotels, shopping malls, theme parks, convention centers and super-sized casinos. In fact, this year, Macao's casinos could bring in about $6.3 billion by December, and some analysts expect they will surpass the Las Vegas Strip in casino revenues. Such an increase in casino revenues, which were $5.33 billion last year, would represent an increase of nearly 20 percent . ''It's the real deal,'' says Nick Cashmore, an analyst at CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, which compiled the comparative data. 
 For decades, Macao was a sleepy Portuguese colony that offered little more than a taste of European architecture in Asia and an array of smoke-filled casinos catering to gamblers from Hong Kong and Taiwan.
 But soon after Portugal returned Macao to China in 1999 after nearly 450 years of colonial rule, the territory's 40-year-old gambling monopoly, controlled by Mr. Ho, ended. Bids for new gambling licenses were accepted, and some of Las Vegas's biggest names started planning for a big invasion. 
 Now Macao is racing to build bridges, tunnels, railways and airports. There are even plans to spend $3.8 billion to build a 17-mile bridge across the Pearl River, connecting Macao and the city of Zhuhai to Hong Kong by the end of the decade, making it possible for visitors to Hong Kong's new Disneyland to also make a quick drive south to the Venetian in Macao.
 Last year, a record 16.7 million people visited Macao. This year, tourism officials are forecasting close to 20 million visitors.
 But there are some problems. Macao has about 10 square miles of land for 470,000 people. And about four square miles of that land was reclaimed from the sea over the past few decades. 
 Though Macao has some beautiful old neighborhoods -- in fact, in early July, Macao was added to the World Heritage List -- it has found it hard to attract visitors with more than gambling on their agenda. Most people just come for the day, traveling by car or bus from the neighboring Guangdong Province through a tunnel that connects the Chinese mainland to the Macao peninsula. Those who stay overnight tend to skip the few five-star hotels on the island in favor of more modest accommodations.
 Las Vegas businessmen, however, are betting that all that is about to change. And no one is betting more than Sheldon G. Adelson, chairman and chief executive of the Las Vegas Sands Corporation. Mr. Adelson has already rounded up some of the world's biggest hoteliers; together with the Sands, they have agreed to spend about $15 billion over the next decade to create a Las Vegas-style strip on a huge parcel of land, most of it reclaimed from the sea.
 The creation of the Cotai Strip -- named after the islands Coloane and Taipa -- opens up a second front for gambling and entertainment in Macao, several miles away from the casinos downtown. The Las Vegas Sands Corporation alone plans to invest about $4 billion to build a group of hotels and condominiums on the Cotai Strip centered on the Venetian Macau, which Mr. Adelson says will be one of the world's largest buildings, a 10.5 million-square-foot hotel, casino, shopping mall and entertainment complex.
 Mr. Adelson says this is all part of his effort to help transform Macao into a convention and resort destination packed with dazzling hotels, celebrity chef restaurants, casinos, big-time theaters and golf courses. 
 His confidence comes, in part, from the success of the Sands Macao, which opened in May 2004 at a cost of $265 million. Nearly 30,000 people showed up on the first day, he says, and profits have been so enormous that a year after opening, the Sands has already paid off its loan, he says. Indeed, profits are so fat that the Sands is now adding 200 more gaming tables to its flashy complex, which will make it the world's biggest casino with 600 tables.
 ''This is a no-brainer,'' Mr. Adelson said. ''If you build it will they come? In my mind, not only will they come, but they'll come in droves.'' 
 Mr. Wynn and Kirk Kerkorian -- two other Las Vegas entrepreneurs -- also have ambitious plans for Macao. And Mr. Ho, one of the richest men in Asia, is under pressure to upgrade his casino holdings aggressively in hopes of keeping pace with his new, flashy competitors from Las Vegas. He has hired the French architect Paul Andreu to design the boat-shaped Oceanus, a $780 million office tower, ''six-star hotel,'' casino and entertainment complex that is planned for what is now a Macao ferry terminal. 
 He is also teaming up with Kerry Packer, Australia's richest man, to build a $1 billion City of Dreams along the Cotai Strip. The pair are promising a resort that ''will appear to float above a crystal lake'' and even feature an ''underwater casino.''
 Mr. Ho and his family of companies have also made a deal to bring the MGM Mirage Company to Macao to open the MGM Grand Paradise casino and hotel. And the Ho companies have plans to build several other huge projects, including a Park Hyatt Hotel and Fisherman's Wharf, the theme park that features replicas of a Tang Dynasty fortress, the Italian Riviera and an ''erupting volcano.''
 Much of the boom, of course, is driven by China's soaring economy, and by the expectation that Macao could draw over 35 million visitors by 2010. Today, largely because the Chinese government has loosened travel restrictions on mainland residents, millions of Chinese are entering Macao, the only place in China where gambling is legal. And they are, for the most part, hard-core gamblers, spending far more in Macao than the average gambler in Las Vegas,. Macao's revenue per table is about $18,000 versus about $2,500 in Las Vegas, according to Aaron Fischer, an analyst at CLSA. 
 ''You rarely see anyone drinking at the table,'' said one local tourism official. ''They only order tea. They don't want to lose focus.''
 But questions remain about Macao's future. Will old Macao and its Portuguese charm disappear or be swallowed by the tourist onslaught in Asia's new sin city? 
 Almost certainly, observers say, old Macao will become a quiet backdrop to the main games in town, gambling and entertainment, as the city is transformed into the ultimate playground for the rich and risky at heart.

Ferry Rides
 Two companies run ferries between Hong Kong and Macao. 
 Turbo Jet ferries depart from the Hong Kong Macao Ferry Terminal, Sheung Wan, the Hong Kong China Ferry Terminal in Kowloon and Cross Boundary Passenger Ferry Terminal at Hong Kong International Airport. A one-way trip starts at about $24, at 7.6 Hong Kong dollars to the United States dollar. Tickets and information: (852) 2921 6688; www.turbojetseaexpress.com.hk. 
 New World First Ferry, (852) 2131 8181, www.nwff.com.hk, runs from the Hong Kong China Ferry Terminal. Fares start at about $18.


CORRECTION-DATE: October 9, 2005

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sept. 11 about casino development in Macao misstated the cost estimate for the Wynn Macao hotel and casino project. It is more than $1 billion, not $700 million. The article also misstated the name of a hotel planned by the Ho companies; it is the Crown Macao, not a Park Hyatt.

HEADLINE: Monthly Data, Overtaken By Events

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
ONE economic report after another is due this week. Under normal circumstances, each might provide crucial clues about the direction of the markets.
 But circumstances have not been normal since Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast. Because all the reports -- on consumer and producer prices, industrial production and the current-account balance -- are based on information collected before the storm hit, they are far less useful than they would be otherwise. That leaves analysts trolling for other numbers offering a truer glimpse of conditions. 
''There is the pre-Katrina economy and the post-Katrina economy,'' said David Rosenberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch. ''Any number that's going to be important for stocks and bonds is not going to be in government reports. The most important data near-term are going to be energy futures. Those are going to be key indicators as far as interest rates are concerned.''
 Energy prices rose when the storm hit, then swiftly reversed course. That has helped raise expectations that the Federal Reserve will take its foot off the brake and limit interest rate increases in order to aid recovery.
 Traders' faith in that outcome may account for the strength in stocks and the weakness in bonds after the storm. Mr. Rosenberg does not share in the feeling of relief, however, and is waiting for the other shoe to drop. After the immediate impact of the storm has dissipated, his attention will return to government releases to get an idea of ''the second-round ramifications.
 ''The widespread view is that this is a transitory event,'' he said, but Katrina ''wiped a city off the map that was $40 billion of G.D.P., and it will take weeks or months to fully assess the impact. The key numbers may be in the data that unfolds in December and early 2006.''

DATA WATCH -- The calendar this week includes reports on Tuesday on producer prices and the trade balance. Economists polled by Bloomberg News estimate that producer prices rose 0.8 percent in August and that the United States' trade deficit with the rest of the world expanded in July to $59.8billion from $58.8 billion.
 Reports on the manufacturing economy follow the next day, covering industrial production and capacity utilization in August. Both are forecast to show slight gains. The big report on Thursday is on consumer prices, which are thought to have risen 0.5 percent last month, the same increase as in July.
 The week culminates in a report on Friday on the nation's current account, the value of goods and services imported and exported, as well as financial transfers. The current-account deficit is predicted to have shrunk last month to $193. billion, from $195.1 billion.

HEADLINE: Storm Warnings

BYLINE: By ROBERT STRAUSS

 BODY:
Floodwaters cut off Wildwood. Absecon Island and Ocean City. Atlantic City had tides 6 feet above normal, with waves 25 feet high under winds that gusted to 84 miles per hour. Wreckage from a 100-foot barge plowed through the center of the Steel Pier In Long Branch, 1,000 feet of boardwalk were carried away ''as if it were made of pick-up sticks'' In Ventnor, the entire boardwalk was destroyed In Point Pleasant, the Lovelandtown Bridge collapsed into the canal The Passaic River rose, halting train service on the Hudson and Manhattan Line. 
 Passages from ''Great Storms of the Jersey Shore,'' Down the Shore Press
 FOR those who insist that the devastation that has engulfed New Orleans can't happen along New Jersey's 127-mile-long coastline, all it takes is a look back to March 1962, when a massive storm battered the state for more than a week.
According to ''Great Storms of the Jersey Shore'' (Down the Shore Press), the storm combined wind, rain, snow, hail, cold and monstrous high tides and leveled much in its path, primarily on the barrier islands of New Jersey.
 The sea broke through Island Beach in eight places, virtually wiping out the beach. Most of the boardwalk in Seaside Heights was uprooted, and almost 100 homes in West Wildwood were torn from their foundations.
 While the storm's intensity surprised meteorologists, most residents heeded calls for evacuation. And because it was a winter storm, the islands were virtually unpopulated.
 But the New Jersey Shore is a much different place today than it was four decades ago. Except for Island Beach State Park and other smaller wetlands and parks, it is virtually all built up. And although it is unlikely that a hurricane packing the ferocity of Katrina would slam the coast full force, there could easily be a repeat of the 1962 storm, a tropical storm or northeaster of substantial magnitude. 
 The question is: if there was such a storm, would the state be as ill-prepared as Louisiana and Mississippi?
 ''Frankly, what we have learned from Katrina is, first, there are so many variables in catastrophic events that we need flexibility in our response and actions we take,'' said Mariana Leckner, the principal planner for the State Office of Emergency Management. ''No. 2, what we have learned is that public needs to be better educated. Emergency management workers at all levels of government need to help the public learn what hazards might affect them and what the response might be.''
 There are a variety of reasons -- climatological, physical, sociological -- why experts say it is unlikely that New Jersey would suffer a New Orleans-like disaster. And there is a lot of higher land, even along the coast, which makes evacuation a less serious problem. 
 ''Right along the coast, the impact might be devastating,'' said Tom Herrington, associate professor of Ocean Engineering at Stevens Institute of Technology and New Jersey's Sea Grant Coastal Specialist. ''We would certainly have a large storm surge and a lot of the Jersey coast, even inland, would flood, but we wouldn't have that sandy water like in New Orleans because no place in New Jersey is under sea level. There would be no filling of the water with mud and debris like there.'' 
 In addition, the general path of hurricanes that come up the Atlantic Coast takes them along the Gulf Stream, a warm current that keeps them intensified. When these storms do hop the Gulf Stream toward New Jersey, they hit colder water, which serves, in essence, to start killing them off.
 That said, experts say they simply do not know what a ''100-year storm,'' the general rubric for the most intense storm, is and whether it might be coming.
 ''Statistically, we don't have enough data,'' said Stewart F. Farrell, director of the coastal research center at Richard Stockton College in Pomona. ''In order to know what a 100-year storm is, you probably need 1,000 years of data. Katrina should give everyone pause in that regard.'' 
 Michael G. Mann, a professor of meterology at Penn State who is compiling research on hurricanes, said that tropical waters in the Atlantic have turned warmer in recent years, perhaps through global warming, and storms have become more intense so that in the future storms that reach New Jersey may well be more intense ''But we just don't have enough data yet,'' he said. ''You can't do this by five or six storms. The truth is that we just don't know, and that may be the most worrisome thing.''
 Experts do agree that winter storms, like the northeaster of 1962, could be far more threatening than a hurricane in terms of size and staying power.
 ''In fact, it wasn't that much of a northeaster in 1962,'' Dr. Farrell said. ''The average wind was only 38 miles per hour, but it was for six days.''
 The problem, he said, was the continuous high tides. ''The first high tide chews up the beach,'' he explained. ''The second one cuts into the dunes. The third breeches the dunes. The fourth one runs into the town. Then there is nothing to save the infrastructure.''
 Indeed, Dr. Farrell said there have been some close calls. He said that in 1992, a northeaster forced the closing of the entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel, which was closed and sandbagged to prevent flooding.
 ''But if a storm came up through Monmouth County and caused a 20-foot storm surge into the 'V' that is formed by Staten Island and Long Island around New York, well that might be something,'' he said. 
 Over the last decade, the Army Corps of Engineers has built up dune structures and beaches from Monmouth to Cape May Counties, but the agency concedes that it could not spare New Jersey from devastation in the event of a 1962-like northeaster or Category III hurricane.
 ''It is not economically feasible to protect against a 500-year storm,'' said Merv Brokke, a spokesman for the Corps. ''You have to weigh the benefits against cost and aesthetics. The new Atlantic City dunes should protect against a 20-year storm, but even at that, it would provide some protection against greater storm surges. It would provide management people time.''
 Those emergency management people say that when it comes to evacuation, time is of the essence.
 ''We work on a worst-case scenario that we can evacuate Cape May County in 36 hours,'' said Frank McCall, director of the county's Emergency Management Communications Center. ''But we have made modifications to the plan and, if pressed, we think we can do it in 12 hours.''
 If necessary, Mr. McCall said, the Garden State Parkway, Route 47, and the Atlantic City Expressway would be turned completely north and west away from the coast. Buses, trucks, and emergency vehicles would go through coastal towns picking up residents who could not leave on their own. 
 The best thing New Jersey has going for it, though, said Lee Clarke, a sociology professor at Rutgers and the author of ''Worst Cases'' (University of Chicago Press), is that the state has an affluent and educated population.
 ''In New Orleans, what you saw was the result of grinding poverty for generations, people who never trusted their government to help them because it never had,'' said Dr. Clarke. ''Here we live in the state with the highest per capita income. We pay for services and we expect to get them. Even the poorest people here, I would suggest, are more likely to, say, have cars and would be available to drive away if necessary.''
 As he put it: ''This doesn't mean that if there is a disaster, everything will be fine. But I don't foresee thousands of corpses piling up along the beaches at the Shore.''

HEADLINE: Swimsuits With Nowhere to Go

BYLINE: By Paula Span

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY 

 BODY:
THINGS are much too quiet at the Sheraton -- the only hotel in the world, it's probably safe to say, where visitors are greeted by a life-size sculpture of Bert Parks. 
 This is the organizational headquarters of the Miss America Pageant. In the lobby -- part museum, part shrine -- display cases still show off the sequined gowns and velvet robes of past winners. On a large video screen, you can watch the winners shrieking and sobbing, embracing and sobbing some more, year after year. 
Not this year, though. 
 Ordinarily, ''the girls,'' as pageant officials still offhandedly refer to them, would by now have wrapped up a week of rehearsals. On Tuesday, they would start preliminary rounds. Friday, they would go parading along the Boardwalk, perched atop convertibles. Then next Saturday 
 Well, to be frank, on Saturday so few people would have been paying attention, in either this old resort or in the rest of the country, that the Miss America Pageant will not take place this week at all. Bounced by its TV network, drawing less than half the viewers it had a decade ago, unable last year even to sell out Boardwalk Hall (''We had a lot of meetings trying to figure out why,'' the pageant's president, Art McMaster, said ruefully), it's leaving the town that created it in 1921. New network: CMT, the country music specialists. New time: January. New place: to be announced.
 Although it's always a bit sad to lose an institution so entwined with the state's history, you won't hear much nostalgic sniffling from this quarter. I appreciate as much as anyone the kitsch value of that tiara-shaped dish of mints at the receptionist's desk, but I've always believed the feminists who picketed the pageant back when were right: it is, like all its offspring, demeaning to women. 
 Insisting that its true mission is distributing scholarships, as its executives unfailingly do, only underscores the problem. Brava for Deirdre Downs, last year's Miss A, who will soon start medical school to become a pediatrician. But why should she have to enter the Miss Alabama contest five years in a row as she did, learning how to pivot ever-more-fetchingly in a Speedo, for help with tuition? Why should her professional education be dependent on her ability to sing, ''I'm Afraid This Must Be Love''?
 My own pageant experience, I admit, was limited to a long-ago bit of guerrilla theater with Vietnam Veterans Against the War. As the smallest woman among the demonstrators, I was selected to be toted down the Boardwalk on a stretcher, bloodied with fake gore and wearing a sash that read ''Miss Vietnam.'' It was an attempt to draw public and media attention, of course. But no one pays the pageant even the backhanded compliment of protesting in front of it any longer. 
 Wouldn't it be swell if that growing irrelevance reflected a commitment to gender equality? But truthfully, any episode of ''The Swan'' is just as cringe-inducing. The pageant's problems -- it lost $1.7 million last year -- probably relate more to the fact that its previous lures are now so available elsewhere. 
 Those who want to ogle can choose reruns of ''Baywatch'' or the cable channel affectionately nicknamed Skinemax. Those drawn by competitions between talented youngsters tune into ''American Idol'' and its imitators. The pageant, which has crowned winners of various ethnicities, one woman with a disability and another with a ''life-threatening illness'' (the 1998 winner was diabetic) is running out of dramatic ''firsts.'' (With one obvious exception, but I don't expect to see an openly lesbian or transgendered Miss America anytime soon, do you?)
 What's more, Atlantic City's transformation puts it increasingly at odds with the pageant's attempts at wholesomeness. The 5,000 or so state organizers, volunteers, relatives and fans who accompany the hopefuls each fall aren't the kinds of people hungry to feed the slots. In fact, the pageant has had trouble even reserving hotel rooms for them; the casinos prefer instead to comp their heavy gamblers. 
 So if the pageant people head to Orlando or Memphis -- Mr. McMaster won't say, but he plans to announce a new location, or a series of them, by month's end -- Atlantic City will barely miss an economic beat. ''It's going to be a very busy September,'' says Susan Ricciardi, a spokeswoman for the Convention and Visitors Authority. 
 Both parties sound like they're going through a reasonably amicable divorce after irreconcilable differences. ''It's been on the downturn for a few years,'' Mr. McMaster says. ''We tried to make it work.''
 And Ms. Ricciardi adds, ''We wish them all the luck in the world.'' 
 Look, it's better this way. Let Miss A and her minions take up residence somewhere that appreciates them. ''The South is the pageant belt,'' Mr. McMaster says. 
 Here, it seems more and more out of sync. A state where a woman was governor, a woman is chief justice of the state's supreme court, and a woman presides over its most prestigious university has different role models. And if we want a queen who can look glam, strut splendidly and really belt, we have Queen Latifah.
 History marches on, Miss America. Here's your tiara, what's your hurry?

HEADLINE: Business, Though Not as Usual, Starts Stirring in New Orleans

BYLINE: By JODI WILGOREN

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Sept. 9 

 BODY:
Bones broken, vital organs far from functional, the faintest pulse has begun to beat in the battered and beleaguered streets of the Big Easy.
 The Drury Inn welcomed its first post-hurricane guests on Friday night, warning that housekeeping would be weekly, not daily, the exercise room was off-limits and continental breakfast was canceled. A tow-truck driver collected a dozen Cadillacs taken from a dealership during the chaos. A dozen men with walkie-talkies worked on wiring the 51 floors of One Shell Square, the city's largest office building.
There is a very tired man patching tires for $12 on St. Claude Avenue in the Bywater neighborhood, and there is a gruff Irish bartender opening icy bottles of Budweiser and Bud Light (Heineken if you know somebody) for $3 in the French Quarter. And on many a downtown street, there is a guy with a blower strapped to his back or a broom in his hand, trying to tidy the place up. 
 ''It may not be the grandest job,'' said Joe Salazar, 50, who said he used to be a clerk in a medical clinic, but now is one of dozens donning dirty R.F.Q., for Rebuild French Quarter, T-shirts as they sweep. ''I feel that every street that's clean, that makes it easier for the city to come back.''
 The vast majority of businesses here are locked tight, the only sign of survival the spray-painted signs promising that looters will be shot. Yet there are snippets of economic activity and signs of more to come soon. 
 Thousands of emergency personnel and journalists are being joined by contractors and cleanup crews, busting the borders of the makeshift encampment of motor homes along Canal Street. They need somewhere to sleep, and how many meals ready to eat can a person eat?
 So far, Salvation Army trucks and free-for-all barbecues at Harrah's casino, the police staging area, have sufficed, but the owner of the Palace Cafe was here on Friday with men in paper masks and knee-high boots to clean out the walk-in freezers.
 ''The one thing we can do in New Orleans, if they are coming down here, is feed them some good food,'' said Dickie Brennan, who owns four downtown restaurants, including the 300-seat Palace. ''We can serve five-star meals.''
 The day before, Jason Mohney, owner of the Hustler and three other local strip clubs, arrived with a few dancers and bouncers and some high-powered flashlights, and found little damage to the red velvet heart-shaped couches and shiny disco balls, just a little moisture and mold on carpets -- probably flooded, but perhaps from spilled beer.
 ''As soon as we have power, that will be the only thing that's keeping us from opening,'' Mr. Mohney said. ''There'll be couch dances as soon as we can get open,'' he promised, though one of the dancers, Dawn Beasley, offered one on the spot ($30).
 According to the Entergy Corporation's storm center Web site, 89 percent of Orleans Parish, which includes the city, remained without power heading into the weekend, though the lights were back on at several buildings and hotels in the central business district considered critical to the recovery effort, as well as at a sewage station on Avenue C and the Audubon Zoo.
 The Drury Inn was one of the first hotels to reopen, the electricity restored early because it is next to Bell South headquarters. It is swapping a week's worth of 75 rooms, about half its capacity, for the help the phone company provided leading its staff through checkpoints into the city and setting its systems straight.
 ''If we house them, then that allows them to do their job,'' said Omar Willis, general manager of a Drury Inn in Houston, who is here for the duration. ''It's mutually beneficial.''
 Guests got a memo along with their room keys that explained the strange situation. ''We do not know if the shower/tub and tap water is safe for bathing,'' it warned. The switchboard would not be staffed day and night. Trash cans and dirty towels should be placed in hallways.
 ''We're going to do with what we have,'' said the general manager, Palestine Riles. ''We have electricity, we have A.C., we have clean beds. It's some sort of normality back in the city. We're trying to get back on our feet.''
 But as some hotels were reopening, the Best Western on St. Charles Avenue, which had filled its 123 rooms every night since the storm despite the lack of running water and electricity, posted a sign Friday night saying everybody would have to check out by 4 p.m. Saturday. The manager, Melissa Kennedy, said she could not continue to operate because her employees and special cleanup crews were blocked from getting into the city; a laundry service came to pick up linens for the first time Thursday, but spent six hours stuck at a highway checkpoint Friday and never made it back.
 ''We have mold growing in the building, not enough people to clean it out,'' said Ms. Kennedy, who has been running the place from a folding table topped with an open jar of Jif peanut butter and half a loaf of bread. ''We'll reopen as soon as security lightens up.''
 With the computer system down, Ms. Kennedy took credit-card imprints and logged checkouts by hand from the journalists who had spent days hovered at the lobby bar, where there was wireless Internet service and people ate cold ravioli and kidney beans from the can. ''I'm hoping everyone in the media's honest enough to give me a valid credit card,'' she said. ''I tell them I can give a handwritten receipt on stationary, or mail them one when the computers get up and running.''
 Outside the historic former City Hall annex in the central business district, lawyers from the firm of Stone Pigman Walther Wittmann filled a U-Haul with files and computer servers to take to their temporary office in Baton Rouge. ''We're not moving out forever, we're just getting some essential equipment,'' said John Colbert, a partner. ''We want to come back as soon as we can.''
 Around the corner, a crew from Walton Construction assessed the damage at one of eight La Quinta hotels, preparing to start repairs Monday. ''I'm fortunate to be in the construction business,'' said the owner, Bill Petty. ''You see bankers, retail people, hoteliers, all out of work.''
 Scattered throughout the French Quarter, a smattering of taverns and cafes are already serving, some never having stopped. At Alex Patout's Louisiana Restaurant on Friday, an open bottle of Champagne on a sidewalk table was surrounded by Mardi Gras beads, one strand attached to an envelope that held a condom and read, ''Prepare to Party.''
 Molly's at the Market, on Decatur Street, is open daily from 11 a.m. to the city's 6 p.m. curfew rather than its usual 6 a.m. last call, and the owner, Jim Monahan, makes change from a metal lockbox. There are no lights -- the beer is on ice that friends mysteriously manage to muster each day -- but there are regulars on the stools.
 ''The place has been closed 29 hours in 31 years -- it's a tradition,'' said Mr. Monahan, who inherited the bar four years ago from his father. ''It's just what my father taught me. You come to work every day. We're hard-working Irish people.''
 Dollars line the bar for tips, though much of the business within the city borders these days is done by barter. Georgia Walker, who has 20 cats, traded water for cat food the other day with ''a bum on the street''; Frank Shea had a surplus of dog food and ended up with oranges. Benjamin Blackwell, who is earning $125 a day running nine-man cleanup crews for Omni Pinnacle, a private company hired by FEMA, swapped cold water for eyewash with an ambulance driving by.
 And if you bust a tire, well, there is only one place to go. St. Claude Used Tires looks as if it was barely standing before the hurricane hit; since, it has replaced or repaired nearly 100 tires. Joe Peters, the broken-down owner of the broken-down shop, was sitting outside one day after the storm when a police officer asked if he could fix a flat; another lined up behind him, and it has hardly stopped since.
 ''I charge the media because they have an expense account,'' Mr. Peters said, pointing to the price list, $6 for a plug, $12 for a patch, $35 for a 16-inch tire, at least until he runs out. ''The City of New Orleans, the government, they sign the book, we'll square up later.''
 Mr. Peters said, ''It feels good to be doing something for my city that's in such bad shape.'' Sure he is making a little money besides, ''but where I'm going to spend it at?''
 ''I can't go buy a beer,'' he said, gesturing at the wide boulevard of shuttered stores. ''I can't get no red beans and pork chops.''

HEADLINE: New Yorkers Want Action At Ground Zero, Poll Shows

BYLINE: By MEGAN THEEand MARJORIE CONNELLY; Fred Backus contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Stop talking and start building.
 That is what a majority of New Yorkers want their politicians to do about the World Trade Center site, according to the latest New York Times Poll.
And most New York City residents think it is fine that plans for the site could include a memorial, office space and residential structures, the poll found. 
 Four years after the Sept. 11 terrorist attack, two-thirds of the city's residents are worried about another attack and almost as many are concerned that the city is not prepared for such an event. Still, 61 percent said that there had been enough talk about what should be done at ground zero and that the time had come to start development. 
 Almost 90 percent of New Yorkers want a permanent memorial to the victims of the terrorist attack at ground zero, but 57 percent also support the construction of office and residential buildings there. Those who said they wanted only a 9/11 memorial weighed in at 29 percent; and 8 percent said it should stay just as it is now: an open hole in the ground surrounded by temporary memorials -- at least for the time being. 
 The views of those who said they lost someone close to them on 9/11 are little different from the opinions of all city residents on what should be done with the trade center site. ''I lost several co-workers and friends down there, but I cannot look at the entire ground zero as a memorial,'' said Perry Catella, a retired emergency medical worker for the Fire Department, in an interview after the survey. ''There should be a portion set aside to be a memorial, but the vast majority of that area has to be put to use to help the economy of New York City.'' 
 The telephone poll was conducted Aug. 22 to 28 with 931 adults throughout the city. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points.
 City residents are closely divided in their opinion of the plans for the Freedom Tower, with 43 percent saying they like the current design and 40 percent saying they dislike it. 
 ''I'm happy with the new design,'' said Jeff Traina, an electrician from Howard Beach. ''It shows that we're still strong.'' 
 Barbara Flanagan, a retired editor who lives in Greenwich Village, is among those who consider the current plans objectionable. ''I'd like to see lower rise construction and a lot of greenery,'' she said. ''I think it will be a long time before people go into high-rise buildings again.'' (In fact, the poll found that 52 percent said they would not be willing to work in one of the higher floors of a new building at the trade center site.) 
 The terrorist bombings in London's subways earlier this summer made some New Yorkers more anxious: Half of those who ride the city's subways acknowledged feelings of unease after the London attacks, and 37 percent said they were still apprehensive. 
 And though two-thirds did not consider the city's subway system to be sufficiently secure, only 32 percent said the random searches introduced after the attacks in London provided additional security. 
 What is the point then? Sixty percent said the searches of bags and packages were simply intended to make riders feel safer.

HEADLINE: Lowering the Barriers for Disabled Visitors

BYLINE: By AUSTIN CONSIDINE

 BODY:
ROSANGELA BERMAN-BIELER brings a certain sensitivity to her work as an expert on disability issues in the Caribbean for the World Bank. Ms. Berman-Bieler, who lives in Washington, is also a quadriplegic who relies on a wheelchair. Just getting off a plane in a place like St. Lucia, she said, presents problems because there are no Jetways.
 ''I had to be carried down the stairs by the personnel at the airport,'' she said about her arrival at the Hewanorra International Airport in April. Being carried by airport personnel who are normally not trained for disabilities, she said, means ''putting in jeopardy our lives and their backs.'' 
 Her experience was not unusual, according to a study of disabled travelers released last month by the Open Doors Organization; (773) 388-8839, www.opendoorsnfp.org, a nonprofit group based in Chicago, with the Travel Industry Association of America. More than 21 million disabled people have traveled the last two years, according to the study. Of the 1,373 adults who were surveyed online and by telephone, 82 percent had problems at airports and 60 percent said they had problems with accommodations.
 Yet the number of vacations taken by disabled people rose 50 percent from 2002, when Open Doors first studied the issue. Disabled adults spend an estimated $13.6 billion a year on travel, the study said. And the Caribbean ranked fourth, behind Canada, Mexico and Europe, as their most popular international destination. 
 In recent years, spurred by advocacy groups, an aging baby-boomer population and a Supreme Court ruling in June that required cruise ships to follow the accessibility standards set by the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, many businesses, and a few local governments, have begun to make the Caribbean more handicapped-accessible, according to advocates for people with disabilities. 
 Businesses on the United States Virgin Islands, for example, have taken some initial steps to comply with the disabilities act.
 ''Many resorts offer A.D.A.-compliant rooms with amenities such as grab bars in the bathrooms, extrawide entryways, reserved parking, ramps and guardrails,'' said Luana Wheatley, marketing director for the United States Virgin Islands Hotel and Tourism Association; (304) 774-6835; www.virgin-islands-hotels.com. 
 Cruising is a popular way for disabled travelers to reach the Caribbean, partly because some lines have been building increasingly accessible ships. According to the 2002 Open Doors study, 12 percent of disabled adults had taken a cruise in the previous five years, compared with 8 percent of all travelers. 
 The bigger problem for disabled travelers is what happens after they arrive. When it comes to infrastructure -- including sidewalks, streets, and access to public buildings and landmarks -- the Caribbean has a very long way to go.
 ''Some of the islands are so poor that I'm sure they don't put it on their radar screen because there are so many other things they have to do, like health care,'' said Ilene Zeitzer, executive director for the United States International Council on Disabilities, a nonprofit group in Washington; (202) 319-9199; www.usicd.org. Which is what motivates people like Ms. Berman-Bieler. Her current project at the World Bank involves studying ways to improve accessibility at tourist facilities on St. Lucia. 
 There are encouraging examples however. St. John in the Virgin Islands has begun an initiative to make the entire island accessible. It is working with the Rhode Island-based design firm Multi, Design for People, local and regional officials and businesses like Concordia Campgrounds; (800) 392-9004; www.maho.org. 
 Other islands are making progress, too. Jamaica ''boasts a high level of accessibility to persons in wheelchairs,'' said Leslie Emanuel of Disabled Peoples' International, a network of advocacy groups. Mr. Emanuel, himself a wheelchair user who lives in St. John's on Antigua, also praised the efforts of Port-of-Spain in Trinidad and the level of accessibility on French-owned St. Martin. 
 Aruba and Bonaire are also making improvements. The tourist area on Aruba, for instance, was developed on level ground, with ramps wherever needed, said Jani Nayar, executive coordinator for the Society for Accessible Travel and Hospitality, a nonprofit organization in New York; (212) 447-7284; www.sath.org. A spokeswoman for Bonaire said all sidewalks in the capital, Kralendijk, were wheelchair accessible. 
 Among the Caribbean hotels that have taken the initiative in recent years is the Martineau Bay Resort and Spa in Vieques, P.R.; (787) 741-4100; www.martineaubay.com. It opened in 2003 and was built with the idea of ensuring wheelchair accessibility. Three of the 138 rooms are equipped with low towel racks and roll-in showers. 
 The Divi Flamingo Beach Resort, (800) 367-3484, www.divibonaire.com, on Bonaire, has five accessible sea-diving boats, which have specially trained staff members to assist people with disabilities. The resort also overhauled its eight disability-accessible rooms (out of 129) in 2002 to make them more compliant with the Americans With Disabilities Act.
 Transportation on the islands often leaves the most to be desired, advocates for disabled people say. But small businesses are stepping up to fill the void. One example is Foster-Ince Cruise Services, (246) 431-8915, www.foster-ince.com, in Barbados, which recently added a wheelchair lift-equipped bus to its fleet. Another is Accessible Adventures, (340) 775-2346, www.accessvi.com, a St. Thomas company, founded in 2003, which provides lift-equipped trolleys and buses and rents specialized beach wheelchairs. 
 Such groups as the Caribbean Tourism Organization, (212) 635-9530, www.doitcaribbean.com, a marketing agency that represents over 30 countries, say they are working to make sure the momentum from early efforts continues. 
 ''C.T.O. will ensure that our members understand and appreciate the growing importance of this issue,'' said Vincent Vanderpool-Wallace, the group's secretary general, ''and that they need to put additional resources into it.''

HEADLINE: Covering New Orleans: The Decade Before the Storm

BYLINE: By Byron Calame

 BODY:
THE early coverage of the devastation of New Orleans revealed a depth of poverty and a troubled levee system that caught many by surprise. As a national newspaper with high aspirations, The New York Times assumes a responsibility to alert its readers to significant problems as they emerge in major cities such as New Orleans.
 Poverty so pervasive that it hampered evacuation would seem to have been worthy of The Times's attention before it emerged as a pivotal challenge two weeks ago. And the inadequacies of the levee system deserved to be brought to the attention of readers more clearly long before the storm hit.
Yet a look back over the past 10 years of Times coverage of New Orleans in its news columns raises serious questions about how well the paper helped readers recognize and understand these two major problems that have compounded the devastation and tragedy of the storm. 
 Poverty emerged as a life-and-death issue as Hurricane Katrina approached the city on Sunday, Aug. 28, and it became clear that many poor residents didn't have cars in which to evacuate. To make matters worse, many poor residents lived in low-lying areas where flooding arrived the soonest and rose the highest.
 As we're now being reminded almost daily, more than two-thirds of the residents of New Orleans are black, and about one in four citizens lives in poverty. The Times has noted that in the Lower Ninth Ward neighborhood, which was inundated by the floodwaters, 98 percent of the residents are black and more than a third live in poverty.
 ''As a close reader of The Times and of poverty trends,'' S.M. Miller, of Brookline, Mass., told me in an e-mail last week, ''I was surprised to learn of the poverty conditions that prevailed in New Orleans. Why didn't the economic-social-racial conditions in New Orleans get some attention in the paper?'' His conclusion: ''The Times let us down.'' 
 Indeed, over the past decade Times readers would have been hard-pressed to find a news headline about the poverty in the midst of the city that brings to the minds of many Americans the revelry of Mardi Gras and Bourbon Street. A search of substantive Times news articles about New Orleans since September 1995, conducted with the help of a researcher for the paper, found none that focused on the city's poor and the racial dimension of poverty. And there were only two articles about the city -- both feature stories -- that contained a few paragraphs on poverty and race.
 Poverty's presence was vividly described in a November 2000 feature article in the Weekend section. ''Poverty persists, cheek by jowl with wealth, much of it inherited,'' the article said. ''A block or two from mansions with palm-shaded gardens stand crude unpainted bungalows fronting on crumbling streets, more reminiscent of the third world than dot-com America.'' It added: ''Most of the poor, in a city almost three-quarters black, are African-American.'' Unfortunately, however, finding these words required reading to the 16th paragraph of the 3,700-word article.
 A 1996 Sunday Magazine profile of the city's police superintendent noted that more residents of New Orleans lived in poverty then than in any other large American city except Detroit. The article suggested that the ghettos of New Orleans ''have been ignored for decades because even though black politicians have controlled City Hall since 1978, African-Americans have never broken the white hold on economic power.'' These insights didn't come until the 12th paragraph of the 3,400-word article.
 What readers would have been more likely to find in The Times's past decade of news coverage of New Orleans were stylishly written articles about the city's charm, cuisine and colorful characters. While some of those articles dealt with crime in the city's predominantly black neighborhoods, the issue of poverty was seldom explored in any depth.
 Levees obviously remain a central issue in the crisis. As experts expected, Katrina showed that a Category 4 or 5 hurricane would send water over the top of the city's levees and flood its below-sea-level ''bowl.'' But the breaches in levees and canal walls made things dramatically worse and raised broader questions about the area's flood control system.
 What had The Times's news columns provided over the past decade to help its readers understand the New Orleans levee system? One major article that focused on levees. The 2,100-word article on the front of the Science section in 2002 made clear that a Category 4 or 5 hurricane would send water over the top of the levees. While the public editor's focus is on news coverage, there was also an Editorial Observer commentary in 2002 that took a detailed look at the problem, based on reporting in New Orleans. But neither the news article nor the editorial commentary prepared readers for the possibility of breaches in the levees or canal walls.
 The article in the Science section did paint a prescient picture: ''Water cascading over the levee wall is just one part of the nightmare, the experts say. Draining the city after the storm moves away may take weeks, they point out. The city would be trapped inside the levees, steeped in a worsening 'witches' brew' of pollutants like sewage, landfill waste, chemicals and the bodies of drowned humans and animals.''
 Given the dimensions of poverty in New Orleans and the city's dependence on a levee system, The Times's news coverage of these problems over the past decade falls far short of what its readers have a right to expect of a national newspaper.

Sources and Motives
 When anonymous sources are used in articles, The Times's policy calls for telling readers as much as possible about their motivation. At the same time, however, named sources are showing up in the paper without relevant background information that would help readers assess their comments. In a similar vein, readers also deserve to know relevant facts about Op-Ed page contributors and individuals who write letters to the editor.
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and the City Council, a May article reported, had agreed to adopt proposed legislation that would establish so-called potty parity for restrooms in certain public places. The proposal, now enacted, requires the affected establishments to provide women with roughly two bathroom stalls for each stall or urinal available to men. 
 This assessment appeared in the fourth paragraph of the article: '''I think it's very important, because New York City tends to set the standard, as they did when they banned smoking, which was immediately followed in many other jurisdictions,' said John F. Banzhaf III, a professor of public interest law at George Washington University who has studied the issue.''
 Saying Mr. Banzhaf has ''studied the issue'' suggests that he was a detached expert. In fact, Mr. Banzhaf has been a party to at least one formal complaint filed with the Department of Education about a public facility on a college campus and has been referred to as the ''Father of Potty Parity.'' Readers absolutely deserved to know this.
 This problem can exist in the opinion pages, too, even though the expectations of readers coming to those pages should be a little different. In a recent Op-Ed article about Internet companies and revolutionary technology, ''Irreplaceable Exuberance,'' the author identification line read simply: ''Henry Blodget, a former Wall Street analyst, writes frequently for Slate.''
 Missing was the fact that Mr. Blodget has been barred from the securities business for life under a 2003 agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. He had also paid a $4 million fine. It wasn't enough, it seems to me, for Mr. Blodget to remark in a parenthetical aside well down in his article, ''This was an unfortunate theory of mine -- one that, along with some e-mails that caught the notice of the Securities and Exchange Commission, helped my Wall Street career go the way of eToys.''
 Finally, there's the Book Review section's egalitarian treatment of its letters to the editor. Its policy is to use just the letter writer's name and city, eschewing titles and other claims to fame. The Aug. 21 issue published several letters that quarreled with a recent cover essay on possible media bias by Richard A. Posner.
 One of the more robust letters -- in both its passion and its length -- was signed by plain Bill Keller, New York. It was, indeed, the same Bill Keller who is executive editor of The Times. Several readers have asked why notice was not taken of his special position.
 ''After all,'' said Peter M. Knapp, of Pembroke, Mass., ''he was writing as a twice-vested insider on a matter, published in his own newspaper, about his profession.'' He added, ''If there was ever a case for 'disclosure,' this certainly is it.''

HEADLINE: Storm Stretches Refiners Past a Perilous Point

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD; Barnaby J. Feder contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
For the nation's oil refiners, Hurricane Katrina was a disaster long in the making.
 Analysts and industry executives had for years feared the consequences of a storm ramming into the country's largest energy hub -- a complex infrastructure that spans most of the coastline between Texas and Alabama, where nearly half of the nation's refineries are located.
Hurricane Katrina confirmed the worst predictions. Wreaking havoc along the coastal states, drowning New Orleans and leaving many dead, the storm shut down nearly all the gulf's offshore oil and gas production for over a week. Racing to restore operations, the industry has brought about 60 percent of that back. 
 The hurricane also knocked off a dozen refineries at the peak of summer demand, sending oil prices higher and gasoline prices to inflation-adjusted records. 
 The events of the last two weeks have demonstrated how close to the edge the country's refining system had been operating, even before the storm. Because the last American refinery was built nearly 30 years ago -- with only a single new one now in the works -- the problem is unlikely to disappear quickly.
 As a consequence, even though crude oil prices have fallen back to pre-Katrina levels, prices for gasoline, heating oil, diesel and jet fuel are expected to remain higher than they were before the storm for a much longer period of time. 
 ''There is now a greater realization that we don't have much extra capacity,'' said Edward H. Murphy, a refining specialist at the American Petroleum Institute, a trade and lobbying group. ''It doesn't take a Katrina, but even a smaller event can create a dislocation in the market. Disasters like this can give you a billboard on the need to address this. We need more capacity.''
 The rapid run-up in oil prices over the last two years has translated into a boon for refiners after many years of meager returns. This year, the refining margin -- the difference between the cost of buying crude oil and selling refined end products -- has exceeded $20 a barrel, far above the long-term average of $6. That has meant record profits for oil companies and refiners and above-average stock performance on Wall Street.
 With profits soaring, the nation's refiners are now being blamed by many drivers and politicians for contributing to the run-up in prices. Indeed, to critics of the industry, the higher profits are evidence of a policy to intentionally limit refining capacity to improve the bottom line. 
 ''Oil companies have jacked up gasoline prices through a simple mechanism: reducing inventories and refining capacity,'' said Jamie Court, president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, an advocacy group, whose views are widely shared by industry opponents.
 ''They are supposed to compete and bring the lowest price to consumers,'' Mr. Court said. ''But the truth is that a small number of oil companies cheat by working together by artificially reducing supplies.''
 But that argument misses the point, said Bob Slaughter, the president of the National Petrochemical and Refiners Association. 
 ''What's happened can be explained by the higher cost of crude oil, the difficulties in building new refineries and the disaster that cut right through the heart of the industry,'' Mr. Slaughter said.
 Currently, four major refineries, owned by Chevron, Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips and Murphy Oil, are either flooded or without power, and are likely to be out of commission for several weeks, perhaps months. Together, these refine 880,000 barrels a day, or 5 percent of domestic capacity. ''It's very significant,'' said Colm McDermott, an oil analyst at John S. Herold Inc. The loss is equal to 1 percent of the world's refining capacity. ''It's a global market and that's certainly enough to have an impact on a global level.''
 As many as 15 other refineries, also affected by the storm, are resuming production, but some are still operating at limited capacity. 
 ''There's going to be a lot of pressure on these people to get things up and running and deal with the maintenance issues as they come up,'' said James W. Jones, a vice president at Turner, Mason & Company, a refining consultancy in Dallas. 
 Many parts of the industry are recovering rapidly. The most damage offshore was sustained by Royal Dutch Shell, which said Friday that its production, usually about 450,000 barrels a day, would be down by 40 percent through the end of the year. 
 But even as oil and gas production returns in the gulf, the time that it will take refineries to get back to full speed will be a key factor in determining how long product prices will remain elevated.
 Under normal conditions, because of the close proximity of volatile materials, high pressure and fire, restarting a refinery is a dangerous process that can take anywhere between three to seven days.
 In the refinery, oil is heated to around 1,110 degrees Fahrenheit, turned into vapor and then collected at various temperatures, creating products that are further refined to remove impurities, allowing for the production of gasoline, heating oil, diesel fuel and kerosene.
 For the four damaged refineries -- three are in the vicinity of New Orleans, and the fourth is in Pascagoula, Miss. -- restarting will involve a much longer process. First, power must be restored. Once that happens, generators, pumps and other electrical equipment flooded by brackish water will need to be dried out. Removing salt sediments will add to the ordeal. Then the operators must check that none of their main systems have suffered any structural damage before firing them back up.
 So far, none of the refineries have provided an estimate of how long all that will take. In its latest report, Chevron, whose 325,000 barrels-a-day refinery is the largest of the four, said ''it will be days before a full estimate of damage is known or when operations can be safely brought back online.''
 Most Americans now pay more than $3 a gallon for gasoline -- matching inflation-adjusted highs reached after the Iranian revolution in the late 1970's and early 1980's and the equivalent, on a per-barrel basis, to $126. Oil prices, which touched a high of $70.85 a barrel last week, now trade around $64 a barrel, still about $20 short of the record set in 1981.
 ''If we lose three or four refiners for two or three months, that shortfall is going to be very difficult to make up,'' said William E. Greehey, the chief executive of Valero, the nation's largest independent refiner. ''I don't know how anyone can blame it on us when we've just had the worst natural disaster in the United States' history.'' 
 The refining outages prompted an international response from industrialized nations to send emergency stocks of oil and gasoline to the United States to plug the shortfall. 
 But that is only a temporary solution to a crisis that has been waiting to erupt for years.
 Since the 1980's, the number of refiners in the United States has been cut in half. From a peak of 324 in 1981, the industry has shrunk to 149 as the smaller, less efficient and less profitable operators once protected by price controls closed, leaving mostly larger companies in place. 
 Refining capacity has fallen about 10 percent, to 17 million barrels a day, while oil consumption rose by 33 percent over the same 24-year period, to 20.8 million barrels a day. 
 Meanwhile, refiners have been increasing their skill in turning crude into useful products; efficiency improved by 27 percent between 1981 and 2004. Still, the difference must be made up by direct imports of refined products, with gasoline imports now at 1 million barrels a day.
 As their numbers dwindled, most remaining refiners expanded their plants and added equipment to process more oil. Many refiners now typically run at 95 percent of capacity, a level that is dangerously high and that has led to a growing number of accidents in recent years. 
 In March, for example, a blast at BP's Texas City refinery, the country's third-largest, killed 15 and injured 170 people. The company was blamed by investigators with the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board for ''systemic lapses.''
 Following the agency's recommendation, BP appointed an independent panel last month to review the ''safety culture'' of its American refining operations.
 Only one project to build a new refinery is currently under way. For the last six years, Glenn McGinnis said he has been struggling to line up the permits, funding and oil supplies to build a refinery from scratch in a remote patch in Southwest Arizona.
 ''The fundamental reason why there has not been a new refinery built for years is really two reasons -- economics and uncertainty,'' Mr. McGinnis said.
 Traditionally, the profit margin for refineries has averaged about 6 percent, a rate of return too low to encourage much new investment. Added to that is the lengthy process involved in securing the permits from state and federal agencies. ''If you take permits, and engineering, and building,'' Mr. McGinnis said, ''you're talking about a 10-year horizon from the time you decide to build to the day the refinery is completed.'' 
 Another issue that has slowed expansion, refiners said, was the cost of complying with environmental regulations set in the 1990's under the Clean Air Act. The American Petroleum Institute estimates that refiners have spent $47 billion over the last decade to meet carbon-emission standards and low-sulfur regulations, with more investments needed through 2007. That, refiners say, is money not spent to raise capacity.
 It has been cheaper to add refining capacity through acquisitions rather than new projects. Valero recently bought Premcor for $10,000 a barrel of capacity, a price many analysts deemed high. But that is well below the $16,000 a barrel that Arizona Clean Fuels, Mr. McGinnis' project, expects to invest.
 Elsewhere in the world, some oil producers are planning to build new refineries. Saudi Arabia is one of them. ''We cannot keep producing oil with no refineries,'' Ali Al-Naimi, the Saudi oil minister, told the industry newsletter Petroleum Argus a few months ago. ''There is a limit.''
 While helpful, such moves abroad would mostly serve to shift the country's increasing reliance on foreign oil producers to a greater dependence on refiners abroad.
 ''We are going to be importing more products,'' Mr. Murphy of the American Petroleum Institute said. ''That is a certainty if we don't expand our capacity. But the problem there is that you've changed one form of dependency for another.''

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sept. 11 about the consequences of a hurricane on the energy industry along the coast from Texas to Alabama referred incorrectly to the status of a safety panel to review refining operations at BP after an explosion at its Texas City plant. While BP announced its plan for a panel, no committee has yet been appointed.

HEADLINE: Japan's Rivalry With China Is Stirring a Crowded Sea

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI and HOWARD W. FRENCH; Norimitsu Onishi reported from Tokyo and Taipei, Taiwan, for this article, and Howard W. French from Taipei and Shanghai.

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 10 

 BODY:
In a muscular display of its rising military and economic might, China deployed a fleet of five warships on Friday near a gas field in the East China Sea, a potentially resource-rich area that is disputed by China and Japan.
 The ships, including a guided-missile destroyer, were spotted by a Japanese military patrol plane near the Chunxiao gas field, according to the Maritime Self-Defense Forces. It is believed to be the first time that Chinese warships have been seen in that area.
 Although the fleet's mission was unclear, its timing suggested that it was no coincidence. The warships appeared two days before a general election in Japan, whose results could greatly influence relations between Asia's two great powers, and weeks before China is scheduled to start producing gas in the area, against strong Japanese protests. 
 In Japan, where the 12-day election campaign was exclusively focused on domestic issues and on what the media described as Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's theatrical politics, the warships were a sudden reminder of its most pressing outside challenge: China.
 Until Mr. Koizumi diverted voters' attention from Japan's rapidly deteriorating relationship with China, the focus for several months had been trained on the increasing diplomatic, military and economic rivalry with China -- much of it taking place in the waters between the countries, filled with potentially explosive issues like oil and gas and Taiwan.
 Both Japan and China are determined to wield a strong hand in the oil-rich seas and strategic shipping lanes that lie between them. 
 ''It is like the 1930's again, when the central Pacific became a vital concern to both the United States and Japan, whose navy was expanding,'' said Adm. Lang Ning-li, who until his recent retirement was Taiwan's director of naval intelligence. ''That means there could be conflict between China and Japan, which both see these seas as vital, and can't share this space.'' 
 Security experts from China, Japan, Taiwan and the United States say all the elements are in place for a showdown over Taiwan between Beijing and Tokyo. No one is predicting war, but Taiwan poses a permanent and unpredictable potential crisis. Washington has a close alliance with Japan, security commitments with Taiwan and a complex relationship with China that mixes rivalry with extensive economic ties.
 For America, whose support of either Japan or China has historically tipped the balance in the region, the implications are enormous. The recent comments by a Chinese general that his country would use nuclear weapons against the United States if the American military intervened in a conflict over Taiwan were a sharp reminder that Taiwan's fate remains one of the region's biggest flash points. Many analysts argue that such confrontation, verbal or otherwise, could lead to a regional arms race culminating in a nuclear Japan.
 Japan imports all of its oil, and because much of it passes through the seas surrounding Taiwan, feels its survival is dependent on keeping those seas stable. Chinese control of Taiwan could hurt Japan's access to oil, Japan fears. And the United States, which has pledged to defend Taiwan if it is attacked by China, would like to count on Japan's help. During the cold war, Japan conducted joint operations with the United States to keep Soviet submarines out of the Sea of Japan. The submarines are now Chinese, but the policy toward them is pure containment. 
 ''You can come out as much as you want, unless you do something wrong,'' said Adm. Koichi Furusho, who served as chief of staff of Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force until January. 
 This cold-war view of China emerged recently in Japan, but Japan's embrace of it is one of the reasons behind the worsening relations between the countries.
 During the cold war, the United States was willing to let Japan remain militarily passive as long as it remained a loyal ally, continued to buy American arms and allowed tens of thousands of American troops to be stationed on Japanese soil. 
 The Bush administration, more suspicious of China than its predecessor, has pushed Japan to take a more assertive stance. It has called for closer ties between the countries' militaries and defense industries and has encouraged conservative Japanese politicians who have long wanted to change the Self-Defense Forces into a full-fledged military and revise the Constitution.
 In short order, the Japanese government reinterpreted the Constitution to allow it to dispatch troops to Iraq and effectively abandoned the decades-old ban against arms exports by joining the American missile defense shield.
 Then Japan assumed its familiar role of junior ally to the United States in containment. In a major readjustment of its defense policy late last year, Japan redeployed its forces away from northern Japan where they were involved in the cold-war containment of Russia and reinforced Okinawa, considered crucial in the containment of China in the East China Sea. Saying that ''China, which has significant influence on the region's security, is pushing forward its nuclear and missile capabilities and modernization of its navy and air force,'' Japan's Defense Agency labeled China a ''concern.'' 
 In recent months, Japan has joined the United States in aggressively lobbying the European Union not to lift its arms embargo on China. But the strongest signal yet was Japan's tougher public stance on defending Taiwan against China. 
 ''The joint statement had less to do with Taiwan and more to do with the rise of China, and how Japan and the United States feel a threat from China,'' said David Huang, Taiwan's vice chairman of mainland affairs. He added, ''The joint statement is a signal to China: 'Don't push too far.'''
 The United States may see its future rivalry with China as playing out on a global stage. But for Japan, the stage is Asia and the epicenter is around Taiwan.
 Japan, which has always seen its lack of natural resources as its Achilles' heel, attacked Pearl Harbor after the United States imposed an oil embargo on Japan. 
 Most of Japan's oil is shipped through two sea lanes: one directly south of Taiwan and another farther south, which increases the shipping length by a costly two days.
 ''If you assume conditions are balanced now,'' said Mr. Furusho, the former chief of staff of Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Forces, ''they would collapse as soon as Taiwan unifies with China. The sea lanes would turn all red.''
 For a generation, asserting control over Taiwan has been the most deeply cherished dream of Beijing's politicians. The separation of China into two parts, in this view, is an unbearable insult to the very idea of being Chinese. Because so few Chinese still feel ideologically bound to the Communist Party, reuniting Taiwan with mainland China is one of the most important ways to bind the government to its public. Standing up to Japan is another, and the two thoughts are increasingly intertwined.
 China's leaders have always felt the need to tread carefully in challenging Washington over its security commitments to Taiwan, preferring to bide their time as the economy grows and the military, particularly its air force and navy, develop into world-class fighting forces. Already, by some estimates, the country has deployed 40 to 60 submarines in the East China Sea, and China is rapidly modernizing this force, acquiring quieter models from Russia and developing increasingly sophisticated nuclear submarines of its own.
 But lately, China has shown no such patience withJapan and has moved swiftly to warn its neighbor in unusually blunt terms that any interference with Beijing's designs over Taiwan will be dealt with forcefully. ''I would like to say calmly to Japan, the Taiwan issue is a domestic affair and a matter of life or death to us,'' China's foreign minister, Li Zhaoxing, told his Japanese counterpart recently. ''It is dangerous to touch China's matter of life or death.''
 Indeed, a potentially explosive tussle is already being played out over large natural gas reserves and potentially important oil reserves beneath the East China Sea. The two rivals disagree over how to draw the maritime dividing line between them in those waters. China has offered to jointly exploit the energy resources in the area, but Japan has refused. Tokyo, meanwhile, has asked China to share seismic data and other information, and more recently has unsuccessfully urged Beijing to freeze its plans to begin pumping gas.
 Chinese officials refused several requests for comment on the issue, but Chinese legal experts say they worry that the situation could get out of hand. ''China has given out warnings many times, using tough words, telling Japan not to take any dangerous actions that could disturb stability in the region,'' said Xiu Bin, an expert in international maritime law at Ocean University in Qingdao.
 Tokyo recently upped the ante by granting a Japanese company, Teikoku Oil, the rights to test-drill in disputed waters. China, which has gas projects near the test-drilling areas, immediately protested. 
 No one watches the face-off more closely than Taiwan, which also has maritime territorial disputes with Japan, but cooperates with Japan and the United States in policing the region's waters.
 ''They are going to be colliding for the foreseeable future, and I don't see how you can avoid that,'' said Andrew Nien-Dzu Yang, director of the Chinese Council of Advanced Policy Studies, in Taipei.

HEADLINE: Off-Campus Voting

BYLINE: By Randy Cohen

 BODY:
I am a student at Kenyon College. Some local residents were upset that hundreds of students were allowed to vote for a property tax that will fall entirely on the permanent residents. Many students favor the measure as a way to finance the local elementary school. Students also note that they are called upon for jury duty. Was it ethical for us to vote? Anonymous, Gambier, Ohio
 Your voting was more than ethical; it was admirable. Such civic involvement is to be encouraged in everyone. 
It is irrelevant that few students pay property taxes. We eliminated economic requirements for voting long ago: you needn't own property; you needn't pay 
 a poll tax. Even people too poor to pay nearly any taxes may vote. Nor is it significant that most students eventually leave town. In four years, many Americans will have moved someplace new, but that doesn't strip their voting rights now.
 Some of the opposition you mention reflects not principle but power: each student added to the voter roles dilutes the power of every nonstudent resident. So be it. You are members of the community with a legitimate interest in its affairs, with the same duty as other citizens to vote wisely, in the best interests of that community. This means you must resist the temptation to, for instance, write in a heifer for mayor (unless it is a particularly talented heifer).
 I received a letter from my former physical therapist that read in part: ''I am writing to all past and present patients to introduce you to a good opportunity. . . . If you have been considering investments, I recommend you call'' -- I'm withholding his name. ''He's very knowledgeable . . . most importantly, you can trust him.'' This man may be the therapist's husband, but I'm not sure. I think this is unprofessional, but is it unethical? Anonymous, Brooklyn
 It is indeed out of line to use a client list for an unrelated purpose. At best, it's 
 a kind of old-fashioned paper spamming. But more disturbing: who wants a financial adviser referred by a physical therapist? What if he contradicts the stock tips you get from your manicurist?
 I have received phone calls soliciting contributions on behalf of law-enforcement pension and welfare funds. Donors receive a bumper sticker indicating support for state troopers or local police. The implication is that such a bumper sticker might assist you in avoiding a traffic ticket. I have never contributed but always wondered if I'm now on a list of people who do not support the police. Are such solicitations ethical? M.W., Ohio
 These solicitations have the potential to be wrong in four ways, which add up to an impressive display of perfidy. If that bumper sticker does not help a motorist beat a ticket, the solicitor is deceitful; if it does help, the solicitor (and police officer involved) is corrupt. And if not contributing actually leads to trouble with the cops, that is a gross abuse of power. None of this iniquity requires anything as vulgar as an overt promise to those who donate (or an explicit threat to those who do not). The very nature of this solicitation reeks of unwholesome inferences.
 Then there is the fourth bit of potential wickedness: this appeal, like any from sources unknown, might constitute actual fraud, with little or no money ending up in those pension funds. Rather than getting out your checkbook at the request of a stranger on the telephone, you'd do well to check on such questionable solicitations by contacting your state attorney general's office.

 BODY:
The Accidental Diet
 Seth Roberts is a 52-year-old psychology professor at the University of California at Berkeley. If you knew Roberts 25 years ago, you might remember him as a man with problems. He had acne, and most days he woke up too early, which left him exhausted. He wasn't depressed, but he wasn't always in the best of moods. Most troubling to Roberts, he was overweight: at 5-foot-11, he weighed 200 pounds.
When you encounter Seth Roberts today, he is a clear-skinned, well-rested, entirely affable man who weighs about 160 pounds and looks 10 years younger than his age. How did this happen? 
 It began when Roberts was a graduate student. First he had the clever idea of turning his personal problems into research subjects. Then he decided that he would use his own body as a laboratory. Thus did Roberts embark on one of the longest bouts of scientific self-experimentation known to man -- not only poking, prodding and measuring himself more than might be wise but also rigorously recording every data point along the way.
 Self-experimentation, though hardly a new idea in the sciences, remains rare. Many modern scientists dismiss it as being not nearly scientific enough: there is no obvious control group, and you can hardly run a double-blind experiment when the researcher and subject are the same person. But might the not-quite-scientific nature of self-experimentation also be a good thing? A great many laboratory-based scientific experiments, especially those in the medical field, are later revealed to have been marred by poor methodology or blatant self-interest. In the case of Roberts, his self-interest is extreme, but at least it is obvious. His methodology is so simple -- trying a million solutions until he finds one that works -- that it creates the utmost transparency. 
 In some ways, self-experimentation has more in common with economics than with the hard sciences. Without the ability to run randomized experiments, economists are often left to exploit whatever data they can get hold of. Let's say you're an economist trying to measure the effect of imprisonment on crime rates. What you would ideally like to do is have a few randomly chosen states suddenly release 10,000 prisoners, while another few random states lock up an extra 10,000 people. In the absence of such a perfect experiment, you are forced to rely on creative proxies -- like lawsuits that charge various states with prison overcrowding, which down the road lead to essentially random releases of large numbers of prisoners. (And yes, crime in those states does rise sharply after the prisoners are released.)
 What could be a more opportunistic means of generating data than exploiting your own body? Roberts started small, with his acne, then moved on to his early waking. It took him more than 10 years of experimenting, but he found that his morning insomnia could be cured if, on the previous day, he got lots of morning light, skipped breakfast and spent at least eight hours standing. 
 Stranger yet was the fix he discovered for lifting his mood: at least one hour each morning of TV viewing, specifically life-size talking heads -- but never such TV at night. Once he stumbled upon this solution, Roberts, like many scientists, looked back to the Stone Age for explication. Anthropological research suggests that early humans had lots of face-to-face contact every morning but precious little after dark, a pattern that Roberts's TV viewing now mimicked.
 It was also the Stone Age that informed his system of weight control. Over the years, he had tried a sushi diet, a tubular-pasta diet, a five-liters-of-water-a-day diet and various others. They all proved ineffective or too hard or too boring to sustain. He had by now come to embrace the theory that our bodies are regulated by a ''set point,'' a sort of Stone Age thermostat that sets an optimal weight for each person. This thermostat, however, works the opposite of the one in your home. When your home gets cold, the thermostat turns on the furnace. But according to Roberts's interpretation of the set-point theory, when food is scarcer, you become less hungry; and you get hungrier when there's a lot of food around. 
 This may sound backward, like telling your home's furnace to run only in the summer. But there is a key difference between home heat and calories: while there is no good way to store the warm air in your home for the next winter, there is a way to store today's calories for future use. It's called fat. In this regard, fat is like money: you can earn it today, put it in the bank and withdraw it later when needed. 
 During an era of scarcity -- an era when the next meal depended on a successful hunt, not a successful phone call to Hunan Garden -- this set-point system was vital. It allowed you to spend down your fat savings when food was scarce and make deposits when food was plentiful. Roberts was convinced that this system was accompanied by a powerful signaling mechanism: whenever you ate a food that was flavorful (which correlated with a time of abundance) and familiar (which indicated that you had eaten this food before and benefited from it), your body demanded that you bank as many of those calories as possible. 
 Roberts understood that these signals were learned associations -- as dependable as Pavlov's bell -- that once upon a time served humankind well. Today, however, at least in places with constant opportunities to eat, these signals can lead to a big, fat problem: rampant overeating.
 So Roberts tried to game this Stone Age system. What if he could keep his thermostat low by sending fewer flavor signals? One obvious solution was a bland diet, but that didn't interest Roberts. (He is, in fact, a serious foodie.) After a great deal of experimenting, he discovered two agents capable of tricking the set-point system. A few tablespoons of unflavored oil (he used canola or extra light olive oil), swallowed a few times a day between mealtimes, gave his body some calories but didn't trip the signal to stock up on more. Several ounces of sugar water (he used granulated fructose, which has a lower glycemic index than table sugar) produced the same effect. (Sweetness does not seem to act as a ''flavor'' in the body's caloric-signaling system.)
 The results were astounding. Roberts lost 40 pounds and never gained it back. He could eat pretty much whenever and whatever he wanted, but he was far less hungry than he had ever been. Friends and colleagues tried his diet, usually with similar results. His regimen seems to satisfy a set of requirements that many commercial diets do not: it was easy, built on a scientific theory and, most important, it did not leave Roberts hungry. 
 In the academic community, Roberts's self-experimentation has found critics but also serious admirers. Among the latter are the esteemed psychologist Robert Rosenthal, who has praised Roberts for ''approaching data in an exploratory spirit more than, or at least in addition to, a confirmatory spirit'' and for seeing data analysis ''as the opportunity to confront a surprise.'' Rosenthal went so far as to envision ''a time in the future when 'self-experimenter' became a new part-time (or full-time) profession.''
 But will Seth Roberts's strange weight-control solution -- he calls it the Shangri-La Diet -- really work for the millions of people who need it? We may soon find out. With the Atkins diet company filing for bankruptcy, America is eager for its next diet craze. And a few spoonfuls of sugar may be just the kind of sacrifice that Americans can handle.

HEADLINE: The Un-U.N.

BYLINE: By James Traub. 
James Traub, a contributing writer for the magazine, is at work on a book about the United Nations.

 BODY:
Two years ago, Kofi Annan, the secretary general of the United Nations, gravely informed the U.N. General Assembly that the organization had reached ''a moment no less decisive than 1945 itself, when the United Nations was founded.'' The world was no longer chiefly menaced by hostility among nations, as it had been then; the U.N. had to adapt to a world threatened by failed states, ethnic hatred, crippling poverty and nonstate actors like Al Qaeda. Annan convened a ''high-level panel'' to recommend ''radical'' changes in the U.N.'s structure and culture. Later this week, more than 170 heads of state, gathered in New York for the U.N.'s 60th anniversary, will respond to Annan's challenge. It appears, at the moment, that their answer will be ''We're O.K. where we are, thanks.'' 
If U.N. reform falters this week, or if only a few noncontroversial measures pass, the blame is bound to fall on the Bush administration and its confrontational ambassador, John Bolton. It's true that Bolton has shattered a great deal of crockery since arriving in Turtle Bay last month, loudly disparaging the laboriously assembled reform package and then submitting a new version with 750 amendments, as well as making common cause with the Chinese to block Security Council expansion. And it's true as well that the United States, owing to its unique position of power and the ideological proclivities of this administration, is willing -- no, eager -- to make a very public bonfire of the high-minded principles of multilateralism. What is less noticed, however, is how many other states -- Russia, China and many members of the U.N.'s still-extant ''nonaligned movement'' -- are perfectly content to dance around the embers. Many members of the U.N. are simply not willing to sacrifice whatever they define as their national interests for the collective good that the organization aspires to represent and advance.
 What then? Edward C. Luck, a professor of international affairs at Columbia, argues that the institution works well enough if you don't have absurd expectations; in any case, he says, the really grave failures, like the ruinous debate over war in Iraq, are caused by profound differences of view, and of power, among major states, about which the institution can do nothing. Luck concludes that the U.N. would be better off seeking incremental reforms that don't force the members to make hard choices.
 But perhaps rather than reconciling ourselves to the U.N.'s inherent limits, we should ask whether we can imagine a different kind of institution -- one, for example, that looks more like NATO, which consists only of members with a (more or less) shared understanding of the world order and thus a shared willingness to confront threats to that order. This new body, which I will call the Peace and Security Union until someone comes up with a more resonant name, would require members to accept, in advance, a set of core principles, including: Terrorism must be unambiguously defined and confronted both through police and, where necessary, military means; states have a responsibility to protect their own citizens, which in turn confers an obligation on the membership to intervene, at times through armed force, in the case of atrocities; extreme poverty and disease, which threaten the integrity of states, require a collective response. 
 Who should be eligible to join? There has been some discussion, mostly in conservative circles, of a new organization of democracies. But many third-world democracies resist almost any encroachment on other countries' sovereignty, whether in the case of ''humanitarian intervention'' or the singling out of human rights abusers; to grant them automatic admission would be to jeopardize the P.S.U.'s commitment to core principles. And it would be just as dangerous to automatically exclude China, since large parts of Asia -- and not only Asia -- would be reluctant to cross a Chinese picket line.
 A better solution is to stipulate that any state that formally accepts the core principles and pledges to put them into effect will be permitted to join the P.S.U. Very few nondemocratic states would be willing to meet this threshold, especially if they could be ejected should they renege on their commitments. But no state could reasonably claim that it had been unfairly excluded.
 Anyone, of course, can swear to anything; the key issue would be the commitments entailed by that pledge. In order to prevent the shameful passivity that the U.N. showed in Rwanda and Darfur, a unit in the P.S.U. would make findings in the case of alleged atrocities; an affirmative finding, whether or not the state in question was a member of the organization, would automatically trigger a graduated series of measures, culminating in armed intervention, which members would have to support. And in order to distribute the peacekeeping burden fairly, states (including the U.S.) would have to designate military units for enforcement activities, as well as the kind of muscular peacekeeping that involves howitzers and helicopter gunships. They would have to make specific pledges to increase foreign aid and debt relief and to lower trade barriers to benefit impoverished countries.
 The major Western states would be inclined to join the P.S.U. because they fear that the U.N. as currently constituted is not up to the challenge of halting atrocities, confronting terrorism and stopping the spread of nuclear weapons. But if the P.S.U. is seen as an alliance of Western states, it will have very little legitimacy in the third world, where most of its forceful actions would inevitably occur. Developing nations must be given a powerful motive to join. This is one reason that the P.S.U. would take seriously the ''soft'' threats of poverty and disease, which are of consuming interest to the developing world. The P.S.U. will also find room on its Security Council equivalent for countries like India, Brazil and South Africa -- as long as they embrace the organization's objectives, of course.
 The P.S.U. would function as a more coherent and effective version of today's Security Council, but it would not be able to ignore the political realities that so often hamstring the council. No such organization, no matter how constituted, could prevent the United States from pursuing what it deemed a matter of vital national interest, as the U.S. did in the case of Iraq. What it could do, however, is offer a forum sympathetic enough to American views and interests to coax the U.S. back into the admittedly vexing world of multilateral diplomacy. That, in fact, would be a major selling point for other states, who fear that absent an effective U.N., the U.S. will settle the world's hash on its own or with ad hoc coalitions of the willing.
 I'm not so naive as to expect any such organization to actually come into being. It took World War I to create the League of Nations and World War II to make the case for the U.N. The failure of Kofi Annan's reform package would not exactly be World War III. But does that mean that we have to wait for another cataclysm to get things right? In early 1945, F.D.R., thinking of the failed League of Nations, said, ''This time we are not making the mistake of waiting until the end of the war to set up the machinery of peace.'' Perhaps this time we should not wait for the war to begin.

HEADLINE: Yes, a Hatch. Got a Problem With That?

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
IT never made George Carlin's list of seven dirty words, but auto executives in the United States are loath to say ''hatchback'' in a voice above a whisper.
 Americans tend to perceive such cars, with their skyward-opening liftgates instead of conventional trunks, as being small, cheap and undesirable. When carmakers have offered hatchbacks, they've often been positioned as rock-bottom entry models.
Efforts to give the lowly hatchback a more lofty status have largely failed, including attempts by luxury car makers. Neither the BMW 318ti nor the Mercedes-Benz C230 Sport Coupe found a following, and they are no longer imported. General Motors turned the Saab 9-3 into a sedan. 
 One notable exception is the reborn Mini Cooper, a huge success. But of course BMW heavily promoted the Mini as a small car with premium features, barely acknowledging its body style.
 No doubt, Americans' acceptance of the Mini impressed Audi as it prepared to import its own premium hatchback from Germany. The A3 was developed to take on the Mercedes B-Class and BMW 1 Series, cars once destined for America but whose future in the United States is now unclear.
 So the 2006 A3 is the Germans' canary in the coal mine. Will its practicality, upscale touches and sensible size win over Americans, especially if high gas prices send car buyers looking for more efficient packages?
 There are reasons to bet on its success. The A3 has two more doors than the BMW 318ti and Mercedes C230 coupe, so it is more convenient for hauling people and cargo.
 And it is artfully styled, unlike hatchbacks of the past that looked like sedans with their trunks hacked off. Sporty and pricey-looking, it definitely turned heads during my weeklong test drive.
 The A3 four-door was designed separately from the A3 two-door that is sold in Europe (and will not come to the United States). The four-door was stretched and widened so the car's interior volume is nearly as large as an A4 sedan's. People of average size should not find reason to complain about the back seat, at least on short jaunts. 
 While luggage space behind the rear seat is tall and narrow, measuring 19.5 cubic feet, a cargo hold of 55.6 cubic feet is created when the split rear seat is folded down.
 The interior reminded me of the more expensive Audi TT sport coupe. The cabin is neat, classy and uncluttered, with touches of aluminum trim.
 Most important, the A3 feels like an Audi even though it shares its chassis with the new Volkswagen Golf sold in Europe (but not here). The only engine currently offered -- a turbocharged direct-injection in-line 4 -- is shared with the A4. That engine has grown to 2 liters, from 1.8; it is rated at 200 horsepower and 207 pound-feet of torque.
 The engine feels peppy in a car so small. Car and Driver magazine recorded 0-to-60 acceleration in an impressive 6.5 seconds. 
 My A3 test car was outfitted with a slick and entertaining six-speed manual transmission, though Audi's Direct Shift Gearbox, an automatic that can be shifted manually with paddles behind the steering wheel, is available. The gearbox borrows technology from racing to make faster, crisper shifts.
 With gasoline prices surpassing $3 a gallon, the A3 offers the best of two worlds. Its spirited performance is on par with some sports cars, but its fuel economy is respectable, with a federal rating of 31 m.p.g. on the highway and 25 in town.
 The A3 now comes only with front-wheel drive. But even without Audi's excellent quattro all-wheel-drive system, the car is a delight on the road. A foot shorter than the A4 sport sedan, the A3 is even more agile. Yet the ride, refined and comfortable, isn't sacrificed in the interest of good handling. The steering is light and direct. A relatively small footprint makes the A3 easy to park in the city.
 More than once, while testing the A3, it reminded me of a long, pleasant trip I once took in the more expensive TT sports coupe.
 Sales expectations are low -- only 10,000 a year in North America. I suspect the A3 will do better, especially if gas prices stay high. But in any case, the A3 could be a hook for the young, hip, affluent customers that automakers crave. To get the attention of this crowd, Audi has used stealthy promotions in a ''Blair Witch Project'' vein, including sponsorship of films by young directors.
 I have just two problems with the A3. First, Audi's reliability has been subpar, ranking 31st of 37 car brands in a recent J.D. Power survey. (It ranked among the top 10, however, in a different J.D. Power survey on the initial quality of new cars.)
 Second, while the A3 starts at a reasonable price ($25,460, which includes a lot of features), options can push the sticker well over $30,000. In December, a version will go on sale with a 3.2-liter V-6 and quattro all-wheel drive. The price of that car, fully equipped, could push $40,000, steep for such a small car.
 As promising as the A3 may be, Audi can't bring itself to call the car a hatchback, instead labeling it a sport wagon. But maybe the company has a knack for renaming roses. After all, it helped to popularize another body style that had a ''wash your mouth out with soap'' label. In Audi's hands, the stuffy ''station wagon'' became the sexy ''Avant.''

HEADLINE: The Crime: Slow Job Growth. A Suspect: Enron.

BYLINE: By DANIEL GROSS. 
Daniel Gross writes the "Moneybox" column for Slate.com.

 BODY:
WHILE the economy has enjoyed steady growth and low inflation since the recession ended in the fall of 2001, many companies have been reluctant to add new workers. ''Any way you slice the data, employment growth has been disappointing in this recovery,'' said Lawrence F. Katz, professor of economics at Harvard. The Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research group in Washington, concludes that the lag in job growth has caused an ''employment deficit'' in the United States of 3.2 million jobs. 
 Mystified economists have pointed to various possible culprits: outsourcing, competition from China, high health care costs and lower work-force participation, to name a few. But there's one force that so far has managed to avoid blame for the sluggish pace of job growth: Enron. 
Until now. In 2000 and 2001, as the bull market imploded, there was a spike in accounting problems -- a mix of outright fraud, earnings manipulation and more benign restatements necessitated by changes in business conditions. Clearly, investors were burned by earnings restatements at Enron and WorldCom, and at hundreds of smaller and less infamous companies. ''Nobody had actually explored the real consequences of earnings management, as opposed to the financial ones,'' says Thomas Philippon, assistant professor of economics at New York University's Stern School of Business. 
 In a recent National Bureau of Economic Research working paper, Professor Philippon and a colleague, Simi Kedia, assistant professor of finance and economics at Rutgers, argued that the widespread accounting problems for which Enron was emblematic might have helped suppress employment growth -- in the affected companies, and in the industries in which the misreporting was concentrated.
 Professors Philippon and Kedia examined the roster of companies that restated earnings from January 1997 to June 2002, as compiled by what is now the Government Accountability Office, and matched it up with available employment data. It was a regrettably large sample: 919 restatements by 845 public companies. About one-tenth of publicly traded companies announced at least one restatement. 
 Not surprisingly, companies that were misrepresenting their financial results -- intentionally or inadvertently -- helped juice employment growth in the late 1990's as they added employees. ''During periods of suspicious accounting, firms hire and invest excessively,'' the professors said. From 1997 to 1999, the restating companies added 500,000 jobs, a 25 percent increase.
 When these companies restated their earnings, the growth they had reported often turned out to be an illusion. As a result, the same companies shed labor quickly. At its peak, Enron employed 20,000 people. But in the weeks after its earnings restatement in November 2001, this new-economy profit machine was suddenly revealed to be an old-fashioned money pit. Within months, the company was down to about 500 employees. The authors label Enron a ''typical -- if somewhat extreme -- example'' of a company whose employment rose and fell rapidly. 
 On the whole, Professors Philippon and Kedia conclude, companies that had to restate earnings in 2000 and 2001 axed anywhere from 250,000 to 600,000 jobs in 2001 and 2002. That would account for a significant chunk of the jobs lost during the period.
 There's more to the story, though. Earnings restatements and accounting problems were concentrated in certain industries, such as energy, telecommunications and business services. And in those industries, many of the companies that didn't have to restate their earnings wound up reducing their head counts. Enron didn't just fire its employees; it terminated relationships with consultants, suppliers and trading counterparts in energy-related industries. 
 ''The end of Enron was clearly bad news for Enron's industry and Houston's economy as a whole,'' said Joshua D. Rauh, assistant professor of finance at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business.
 What's more, restatements create industrywide uncertainty that can inhibit future hiring. When WorldCom was revealed to have fudged its earnings, it became clear that the business model for telecommunications and data services wasn't nearly as profitable as WorldCom had made it out to be. ''All of the sudden, the entire industry appears to have excess labor,'' Professor Kedia said. And once many of the assumptions about the industry's business models turned out to be false, executives and investors were naturally gun-shy about hiring and expanding.
 PROFESSORS Philippon and Kedia added indirect effects on jobs to the direct job losses sustained by restating companies and then constructed a model to extrapolate these estimates to the entire United States economy. They concluded that the effects went a long way toward explaining why employment growth fell to zero in 2001 from 2 percent in 1999. 
 ''I don't want to oversell this, but if the indirect effects are what we think they are, then they can account for the job loss in 2001 and 2002,'' Professor Philippon said. 
 These conclusions are speculative. And economists, while open to the suggestion that accounting problems have an impact beyond the stock market, warn against putting too much credence in a single explanation. 
 ''Explaining the unique characteristics of this unbalanced recovery is more like 'Murder on the Orient Express' than finding a smoking gun in somebody's hands,'' said Jared Bernstein, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute. ''There are a lot of suspects.''

HEADLINE: Gas Tax or No Gas Tax: the Debate Is On

BYLINE: By GREG CLARKIN

 BODY:
IN the days following Hurricane Katrina, Scott Jevarjian of Norwalk saw the price of filling the 50-gallon tank of his Hummer jump by more than $40.
 Mr. Jevarjian said he is now considering ''getting rid of'' the vehicle, but he also wants Connecticut politicians to do their part. ''They should cut the gas tax,'' he said. ''It's a rip-off.'' 
While Mr. Jevarjian may not get his wish of a full tax cut, Gov. M. Jodi Rell is considering suspending the state's 25-cents-a-gallon gasoline tax. 
 ''Everything is on the table,'' said Rich Harris, a spokesman for Mrs. Rell. ''All the actions need to be carefully and fully considered.'' 
 Residents pump 1.6 billion gallons of gasoline a year, according to the Independent Connecticut Petroleum Association, so even a short suspension could have a dramatic impact on the state.
 ''The worst thing we can do is go, ready, fire, aim,'' said Nick Perna, economic adviser to the Webster Financial Corporation.
 Mr. Perna was among the speakers at a recent meeting of energy, business and economics experts called by Mrs. Rell. 
 Mr. Perna said that several proposals were discussed to reduce gas prices, but that all need to be weighed against the financial impact on the state. ''They're all worthwhile things, but how do we do the least amount of damage to the state treasury?'' Mr. Perna said. 
 Another proposal called for a change in the gross receipts tax, the tax paid by gasoline wholesalers. It is currently calculated at about 6 percent of the wholesale cost of gasoline, but some energy executives want it changed to a flat per-gallon fee. 
 ''It shouldn't be a percentage anyway,'' said Michael Fox, executive director of the Gasoline and Automotive Service Dealers of America. ''Peg it at 6 cents a gallon.'' 
 The tax, about 19 cents a gallon on regular unleaded, is passed along to consumers. Cut the levy to 6 cents a gallon and Mr. Fox said that motorists would save more than a dime a gallon. 
 Revenue from the tax goes toward Mrs. Rell's $1.3 billion transportation plan, among other things. 
 Mr. Fox said as gas prices have risen, the state has taken in more than expected from the percentage-based tax. ''You're only going to remove that excess layer that disappears into the general fund,'' he said of the unexpected windfall. 
 Robert Genuario, the state budget director, estimated the windfall would be ''tens of millions of dollars.''
 Other proposed ways to cut gas prices include waving environmental regulations and exploring how widespread the impact of zone pricing (varying prices based on demographics, location and business costs) is on consumers. 
 Richard Blumenthal, the state attorney general, is also investigating the more than 300 complaints of price gouging his office received in the days after the hurricane. 
 ''The surge in prices has been unprecedented in it's pace and magnitude, so our fear is something more than supply and demand is at work,'' Mr. Blumenthal said.

HEADLINE: The Storm Next Time

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF. 
E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

 BODY:
If the White House wants to move the debate about Hurricane Katrina beyond what it calls the ''blame game'' for bodies decomposing in the streets of New Orleans, then here's a constructive step that President Bush could take to protect people in the future: Tackle global warming.
 True, we don't know whether Katrina was linked to global warming. But there are indications that global warming will produce more Category 5 hurricanes. Now that we've all seen what a Katrina can do -- and Katrina was only Category 4 when it hit Louisiana -- it would be crazy for President Bush to continue to refuse to develop a national policy on greenhouse gases. 
 ''The available scientific evidence indicates that it is likely that global warming will make -- and possibly already is making -- those hurricanes that form more destructive than they otherwise would have been,'' declares an analysis by five climate scientists at www.realclimate.org.
 Hurricanes derive their power in part from warm water, and so forecasting models show future hurricanes becoming more severe as sea surface temperatures rise. One summary of 1,200 simulations published in the Journal of Climate last year showed that rising levels of greenhouse gases could triple the number of Category 5 hurricanes. (I have links to that study and others in the Web version of this column at nytimes.com/opinion.) 
 Moreover, there's empirical evidence that hurricanes have already become more intense (but not more frequent). Nature magazine this summer reported a new study by Kerry Emanuel, a hurricane guru at M.I.T., indicating that by one measure hurricanes have almost doubled in intensity over the last 30 years.
 That reflects natural cycles as well. But Professor Emanuel writes: ''The large upswing in the last decade is unprecedented, and probably reflects the effect of global warming.''
 He adds: ''My results suggest that future warming may lead to a substantial increase in hurricane-related losses in the 21st century.''
 Global warming also makes hurricanes more destructive by raising the sea level. One Environmental Protection Agency study foresees a one-foot rise in sea levels on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts by 2050 and a two-foot (and possibly four-foot) rise by 2100. 
 A two-foot rise would swallow a chunk of the United States bigger than Massachusetts, according to the E.P.A., and would also result in much more coastal flooding. One study by FEMA found that just a one-foot rise in sea levels would increase flood damage by 36 to 58 percent -- underscoring that we need to bolster coastal protections as well as curb carbon emissions.
 So far, Mr. Bush has resisted serious action on global warming on the basis that strong measures ''would have wrecked our economy.''
 Tell that to Portland, Ore. In early July, I wrote a column from Portland about its pioneering efforts to cut greenhouse gases. New calculations had indicated that it had cut total emissions below the level of 1990 -- the benchmark for the Kyoto accord -- even as nationally, emissions have increased 13 percent. And Portland has been booming economically.
 Since then, Portland has discovered a small error in its calculations: In fact, total emissions were reduced to a hair over 1990 levels, not to a hair under. In any case, while the numbers aren't perfect, the trend is clear.
 So Portland remains a model for what the Bush administration could do if it wanted to get serious about climate change. The steps Portland took included encouraging walking and bicycle commuting, telling local companies that if they give employees free parking they should also subsidize bus passes, and replacing bulbs in traffic lights with light-emitting diodes that cut electrical use by 80 percent. That last move saved the city almost $500,000 a year in electrical costs. I can't figure out why Mr. Bush is so reluctant to embrace such steps. 
 Portland has also put teeth into its environmentalism by joining the Chicago Climate Exchange and making a legally binding commitment to reduce emissions. The Chicago Climate Exchange also counts as members cities like Chicago and Oakland, as well as universities like Tufts and the University of Minnesota. Those members are leading the way in addressing climate change -- a contrast with the paralysis in Washington. 
 With corpses on the streets of New Orleans, we may have seen a glimpse of the future of climate change. Let's hope it shakes Mr. Bush out of his complacency.

 BODY:
I. Seldom has an image so clearly marked the turning of the world. One of man's mightiest structures collapses into an immense white blossom of churning, roiling dust, metamorphosing in 14 seconds from hundred-story giant of the earth into towering white plume reaching to heaven. The demise of the World Trade Center gave us an image as newborn to the world of sight as the mushroom cloud must have appeared to those who first cast eyes on it. I recall vividly the seconds flowing by as I sat gaping at the screen, uncomprehending and unbelieving, while Peter Jennings's urbane, perfectly modulated voice murmured calmly on about flights being grounded, leaving unacknowledged and unexplained -- unconfirmed -- the incomprehensible scene unfolding in real time before our eyes. ''Hang on there a second,'' the famously unflappable Jennings finally stammered -- the South Tower had by now vanished into a boiling caldron of white smoke -- ''I just want to check one thing. . .because. . .we now have.. . .What do we have? We don't. . .?'' Marveling later that ''the most powerful image was the one I actually didn't notice while it was occurring,'' Jennings would say simply that ''it was beyond our imagination.'' 
 Looking back from this moment, precisely four years later, it still seems almost inconceivable that 10 men could have done that -- could have brought those towers down. Could have imagined doing what was ''beyond our imagination.'' When a few days later, the German composer Karlheinz Stockhausen remarked that this was ''the greatest work of art in the history of the cosmos,'' I shared the anger his words called forth but couldn't help sensing their bit of truth: ''What happened there -- spiritually -- this jump out of security, out of the everyday, out of life, that happens sometimes poco a poco in art.'' No ''little by little'' here: however profoundly evil the art, the sheer immensity and inconceivability of the attack had forced Americans instantaneously to ''jump out of security, out of the everyday, out of life'' and had thrust them through a portal into a strange and terrifying new world, where the inconceivable, the unimaginable, had become brutally possible.
 In the face of the unimaginable, small wonder that leaders would revert to the language of apocalypse, of crusade, of ''moral clarity.'' Speaking at the National Cathedral just three days after the attacks, President Bush declared that while ''Americans do not yet have the distance of history. . .our responsibility to history is already clear: to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil.'' Astonishing words -- imaginable, perhaps, only from an American president, leading a people given naturally in times of crisis to enlisting national power in the cause of universal redemption. ''The enemy is not a single political regime or person or religion or ideology,'' declared the National Security Strategy of the United States of America for 2002. ''The enemy is terrorism -- premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against innocents.'' Not Islamic terrorism or Middle Eastern terrorism or even terrorism directed against the United States: terrorism itself. ''Declaring war on 'terror,''' as one military strategist later remarked to me, ''is like declaring war on air power.'' It didn't matter; apocalypse, retribution, redemption were in the air, and the grandeur of the goal must be commensurate with the enormity of the crime. Within days of the attacks, President Bush had launched a ''global war on terror.''
 Today marks four years of war. Four years after the attack on Pearl Harbor, U.S. troops ruled unchallenged in Japan and Germany. During those 48 months, Americans created an unmatched machine of war and decisively defeated two great enemies. 
 How are we to judge the global war on terror four years on? In this war, the president had warned, ''Americans should not expect one battle but a lengthy campaign.'' We could expect no ''surrender ceremony on a deck of a battleship,'' and indeed, apart from the president's abortive attempt on the U.S.S. Lincoln to declare victory in Iraq, there has been none. Failing such rituals of capitulation, by what ''metric'' -- as the generals say -- can we measure the progress of the global war on terror?
 Four years after the collapse of the towers, evil is still with us and so is terrorism. Terrorists have staged spectacular attacks, killing thousands, in Tunisia, Bali, Mombasa, Riyadh, Istanbul, Casablanca, Jakarta, Madrid, Sharm el Sheik and London, to name only the best known. Last year, they mounted 651 ''significant terrorist attacks,'' triple the year before and the highest since the State Department started gathering figures two decades ago. One hundred ninety-eight of these came in Iraq, Bush's ''central front of the war on terror'' -- nine times the year before. And this does not include the hundreds of attacks on U.S. troops. It is in Iraq, which was to serve as the first step in the ''democratization of the Middle East,'' that insurgents have taken terrorism to a new level, killing well over 4,000 people since April in Baghdad alone; in May, Iraq suffered 90 suicide-bombings. Perhaps the ''shining example of democracy'' that the administration promised will someday come, but for now Iraq has become a grotesque advertisement for the power and efficacy of terror.
 As for the ''terrorist groups of global reach,'' Al Qaeda, according to the president, has been severely wounded. ''We've captured or killed two-thirds of their known leaders,'' he said last year. And yet however degraded Al Qaeda's operational capacity, nearly every other month, it seems, Osama bin Laden or one of his henchmen appears on the world's television screens to expatiate on the ideology and strategy of global jihad and to urge followers on to more audacious and more lethal efforts. This, and the sheer number and breadth of terrorist attacks, suggest strongly that Al Qaeda has now become Al Qaedaism -- that under the American and allied assault, what had been a relatively small, conspiratorial organization has mutated into a worldwide political movement, with thousands of followers eager to adopt its methods and advance its aims. Call it viral Al Qaeda, carried by strongly motivated next-generation followers who download from the Internet's virtual training camp a perfectly adequate trade-craft in terror. Nearly two years ago, Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld, in a confidential memorandum, posed the central question about the war on terror: ''Are we capturing, killing or deterring and dissuading more terrorists every day than the madrassas and the radical clerics are recruiting, training and deploying against us?'' The answer is clearly no. ''We have taken a ball of quicksilver,'' says the counterinsurgency specialist John Arquilla, ''and hit it with a hammer.'' 
 What has helped those little bits of quicksilver grow and flourish is, above all, the decision to invade and occupy Iraq, which has left the United States bogged down in a brutal, highly visible counterinsurgency war in the heart of the Arab world. Iraq has become a training ground that will temper and prepare the next generation of jihadist terrorists and a televised stage from which the struggle of radical Islam against the ''crusader forces'' can be broadcast throughout the Islamic world. ''Islamic extremists are exploiting the Iraqi conflict to recruit new anti-U.S. jihadists,'' Porter J. Goss, director of the C.I.A., told the Senate in February. ''These jihadists who survive will leave Iraq experienced in, and focused on, acts of urban terrorism. They represent a potential pool of contacts to build transnational terrorist cells, groups and networks in Saudi Arabia, Jordan and other countries.''
 As the Iraq war grows increasingly unpopular in the United States -- scarcely a third of Americans now approve of the president's handling of the war, and 4 in 10 think it was worth fighting -- and as more and more American leaders demand that the administration ''start figuring out how we get out of there'' (in the words of Senator Chuck Hagel, a Republican), Americans confront a stark choice: whether to go on indefinitely fighting a politically self-destructive counterinsurgency war that keeps the jihadists increasingly well supplied with volunteers or to withdraw from a post-Saddam Hussein Iraq that remains chaotic and unstable and beset with civil strife and thereby hand Al Qaeda and its allies a major victory in the war on terror's ''central front.'' 
 Four years after we watched the towers fall, Americans have not succeeded in ''ridding the world of evil.'' We have managed to show ourselves, our friends and most of all our enemies the limits of American power. Instead of fighting the real war that was thrust upon us on that incomprehensible morning four years ago, we stubbornly insisted on fighting a war of the imagination, an ideological struggle that we defined not by frankly appraising the real enemy before us but by focusing on the mirror of our own obsessions. And we have finished -- as the escalating numbers of terrorist attacks, the grinding Iraq insurgency, the overstretched American military and the increasing political dissatisfaction at home show -- by fighting precisely the kind of war they wanted us to fight.

II. Facing what is beyond imagination, you find sense in the familiar. Standing before Congress on Sept. 20, 2001, George W. Bush told Americans why they had been attacked. ''They hate our freedoms,'' the president declared. ''Our freedom of speech, our freedom to vote and assemble and disagree with each other.'' As for Al Qaeda's fundamentalist religious mission: ''We are not deceived by their pretenses to piety. We have seen their kind before. They are the heirs of all the murderous ideologies of the 20th century. By sacrificing human life to serve their radical visions -- by abandoning every value except the will to power -- they follow in the path of fascism, and Nazism, and totalitarianism. And they will follow that path all the way, to where it ends: in history's unmarked grave of discarded lies.''
 Stirring words, and effective, for they domesticated the unthinkable in the categories of the accustomed. The terrorists are only the latest in a long line of ''evildoers.'' Like the Nazis and the Communists before them, they are Americans' evil twins: tyrants to our free men, totalitarians to our democrats. The world, after a confusing decade, had once again split in two. However disorienting the horror of the attacks, the ''war on terror'' was simply a reprise of the cold war. As Harry S. Truman christened the cold war by explaining to Americans how, ''at the present moment in world history, nearly every nation must choose between alternative ways of life,'' George W. Bush declared his global war on terror by insisting that ''every nation, in every region, now has a decision to make. Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.'' The echo, as much administration rhetoric since has shown, was not coincidental. Terrorists, like Communists, despised America not because of what our country did but because of who we are. Hating ''our values'' and ''our freedoms,'' the evildoers were depicted as deeply irrational and committed to a nihilistic philosophy of obliteration, reawakening for Americans the sleeping image of the mushroom cloud. ''This is not aimed at our policies,'' Henry Kissinger intoned. ''This is aimed at our existence.''
 Such rhetoric not only fell easily on American ears. It provided a familiar context for a disoriented national-security bureaucracy that had been created to fight the cold war and was left, at its ending, without clear purpose. ''Washington policy and defense cultures still seek out cold-war models,'' as members of the Defense Science Board, a Defense Department task force commissioned to examine the war on terror, observed in a report last year. ''With the surprise announcement of a new struggle, the U.S. government reflexively inclined toward cold-war-style responses to the new threat, without a thought or a care as to whether these were the best responses to a very different strategic situation.'' 
 Al Qaeda was not the Nazis or the Soviet Communists. Al Qaeda controlled no state, fielded no regular army. It was a small, conspiratorial organization, dedicated to achieving its aims through guerrilla tactics, notably a kind of spectacular terrorism carried to a level of apocalyptic brutality the world had not before seen. Mass killing was the necessary but not the primary aim, for the point of such terror was to mobilize recruits for a political cause -- to move sympathizers to act -- and to tempt the enemy into reacting in such a way as to make that mobilization easier. And however extreme and repugnant Al Qaeda's methods, its revolutionary goals were by no means unusual within Islamist opposition groups throughout the Muslim world. ''If there is one overarching goal they share,'' wrote the authors of the Defense Science Board report, ''it is the overthrow of what Islamists call the 'apostate' regimes: the tyrannies of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Jordan and the gulf states.. . .The United States finds itself in the strategically awkward -- and potentially dangerous -- situation of being the longstanding prop and alliance partner of these authoritarian regimes. Without the U.S., these regimes could not survive. Thus the U.S. has strongly taken sides in a desperate struggle that is both broadly cast for all Muslims and country-specific.''
 The broad aim of the many-stranded Salafi movement, which includes the Muslim Brotherhood of Egypt and the Wahhabis of Saudi Arabia and of which Al Qaeda is one extreme version, is to return Muslims to the ancient ways of pure Islam -- of Islam as it was practiced by the Prophet Muhammad and his early followers in the seventh century. Standing between the more radical Salafi groups and their goal of a conservative Islamic revolution are the ''apostate regimes,'' the ''idolators'' now ruling in Riyadh, Cairo, Amman, Islamabad and other Muslim capitals. All these authoritarian regimes oppress their people: on this point Al Qaeda and those in the Bush administration who promote ''democratization in the Arab world'' agree. Many of the Salafists, however, see behind the ''near enemies'' ruling over them a ''far enemy'' in Washington, a superpower without whose financial and military support the Mubarak regime, the Saudi royal family and the other conservative autocracies of the Arab world would fall before their attacks. When the United States sent hundreds of thousands of American troops to Saudi Arabia after Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, Al Qaeda seized on the perfect issue: the ''far enemy'' had actually come and occupied the Land of the Two Holy Places and done so at the shameful invitation of the ''near enemy'' -- the corrupt Saudi dynasty. As bin Laden observed of the Saudis in his 1996 ''Declaration of Jihad'': ''This situation is a curse put on them by Allah for not objecting to the oppressive and illegitimate behavior and measures of the ruling regime: ignoring the divine Shariah law; depriving people of their legitimate rights; allowing the Americans to occupy the Land of the Two Holy Places.''
 But how to ''re-establish the greatness of this Ummah'' -- the Muslim people -- ''and to liberate its occupied sanctities''? On this bin Laden is practical and frank: because of ''the imbalance of power between our armed forces and the enemy forces, a suitable means of fighting must be adopted, i.e., using fast-moving light forces that work under complete secrecy. In other words, to initiate a guerrilla warfare.'' Such warfare, depending on increasingly spectacular acts of terrorism, would be used to ''prepare and instigate the Ummah. . .against the enemy.'' The notion of ''instigation,'' indeed, is critical, for the purpose of terror is not to destroy your enemy directly but rather to spur on your sleeping allies to enlightenment, to courage and to action. It is a kind of horrible advertisement, meant to show those millions of Muslims who sympathize with Al Qaeda's view of American policy that something can be done to change it.

III. Fundamentalist Islamic thought took aim at America's policies, not at its existence. Americans tend to be little interested in these policies or their history and thus see the various Middle East cataclysms of the last decades as sudden, unrelated explosions lighting up a murky and threatening landscape, reinforcing the sense that the 9/11 attacks were not only deadly and appalling but also irrational, incomprehensible: that they embodied pure evil. The central strand of American policy -- unflinching support for the conservative Sunni regimes of the Persian Gulf -- extends back 60 years, to a legendary meeting between Franklin D. Roosevelt and King Saud aboard an American cruiser in the Great Bitter Lake in Egypt. The American president and the Saudi king agreed there on a simple bond of interest: the Saudis, rulers over a sparsely populated but incalculably wealthy land, would see their power guaranteed against all threats, internal and external. In return, the United States could count on a stable supply of oil, developed and pumped by American companies. This policy stood virtually unthreatened for more than three decades.
 The eruption of Iran's Islamic revolution in 1978 dealt a blow to this compact of interests and cast in relief its central contradictions. The shah, who owed his throne to a covert C.I.A. intervention that returned him to power in 1953, had been a key American ally in the gulf, and the Islamic revolution that swept him from power showed at work what was to become a familiar dynamic: ''friendly'' autocrats ruling over increasingly impatient and angry peoples who evidence resentment if not outright hostility toward the superpower ally, in whom they see the ultimate source of their own repression. 
 Iran's Islamic revolution delivered a body blow to the Middle East status quo not unlike that landed by the French Revolution on the European autocratic order two centuries before; it was ideologically aggressive, inherently expansionist and deeply threatening to its neighbors -- in this case, to the United States' Sunni allies, many of whom had substantial Shia minorities, and to Iraq, which, though long ruled by Sunnis, had a substantial Shia majority. Ayatollah Khomeini's virulent and persistent calls for Saddam Hussein's overthrow, and the turmoil that had apparently weakened the Iranian armed forces, tempted Saddam Hussein to send his army to attack Iran in 1980. American policy makers looked on this with favor, seeing in the bloody Iran-Iraq war the force that would blunt the revolutionary threat to America's allies. Thus President Reagan sent his special envoy Donald Rumsfeld to Baghdad in 1983 to parlay with Hussein, and thus the administration supported the dictator with billions of dollars of agricultural credits, supplied the Iraqis with hundreds of millions of dollars in advanced weaponry through Egypt and Saudi Arabia and provided Hussein's army with satellite intelligence that may have been used to direct chemical weapons against the massed infantry charges of Iranian suicide brigades. 
 The Iraqis fought the Iranians to a standstill but not before ripples from Iran's revolution threatened to overwhelm American allies, notably the Saudi dynasty, whose rule was challenged by radicals seizing control of the Grand Mosque in Mecca in November 1979, and the Egyptian autocracy, whose ruler, Anwar el-Sadat, was assassinated by Islamists as he presided over a military parade in October 1981. The Saudis managed to put down the revolt, killing hundreds. The Egyptians, under Hosni Mubarak, moved with ruthless efficiency to suppress the Islamists, jailing and torturing thousands, among them Osama bin Laden's current deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri. Merciless repression by both autocracies' effective security services led thousands to flee abroad.
 Many went to Afghanistan, which the Soviet Red Army occupied in 1979 to prop up its own tottering client, then under threat from Islamic insurgents -- mujahedeen, or ''holy warriors,'' who were being armed by the United States. ''It was July 3, 1979, that President Carter signed the first directive for secret aid to the opponents of the pro-Soviet regime in Kabul,'' Zbigniew Brzezinski, Carter's national security adviser, recalled in 1998. ''And that very day, I wrote a note to the president in which I explained to him that in my opinion this aid was going to induce a Soviet military intervention.'' It was a strategy of provocation, for the gambit had the effect of ''drawing the Russians into the Afghan trap.. . .The day that the Soviets officially crossed the border, I wrote to President Carter: We now have the opportunity of giving to the U.S.S.R. its Vietnam War.'' 
 If, to the Americans, supporting the Afghan mujahedeen seemed an excellent way to bleed the Soviet Union, to the Saudis and other Muslim regimes, supporting a ''defensive jihad'' to free occupied Muslim lands was a means to burnish their tarnished Islamic credentials while exporting a growing and dangerous resource (frustrated, radical young men) so they would indulge their taste for pious revolution far from home. Among the thousands of holy warriors making this journey was the wealthy young Saudi Osama bin Laden, who would set up the Afghan Services Bureau, a ''helping organization'' for Arab fighters that gathered names and contact information in a large database -- or ''qaeda'' -- which would eventually lend its name to an entirely new organization. Though the Afghan operation was wildly successful, as judged by its American creators -- ''What is most important to the history of the world?'' Brzezinski said in 1998, ''some stirred-up Muslims or the liberation of Central Europe and the end of the cold war?'' -- it had at least one unexpected result: it created a global jihad movement, led by veteran fighters who were convinced that they had defeated one superpower and could defeat another.
 The present jihad took shape in the backwash of forgotten wars. After the Soviet Army withdrew in defeat, the United States lost interest in Afghanistan, leaving the mujahedeen forces to battle for the ruined country in an eight-year blood bath from which the Taliban finally emerged victorious. In the gulf, after eight years of fantastically bloody combat, Saddam Hussein forced the Iranians to sign a cease-fire, a ''victory'' that left his regime heavily armed, bloodied and bankrupt. To pay for his war, Hussein had borrowed tens of billions of dollars from the Saudis, Kuwaitis and other neighbors, and he now demanded that these debts be forgiven -- he had incurred them, as he saw it, defending the lenders from Khomeini -- and that oil prices be raised. The Kuwaitis' particularly aggressive refusal to do either led Hussein, apparently believing that the Americans would accept a fait accompli, to invade and annex the country.
 The Iraqi Army flooding into Kuwait represented, to bin Laden, the classic opportunity. He rushed to see the Saudi leaders, proposing that he defend the kingdom with his battle-tested corps of veteran holy warriors. The Saudis listened patiently to the pious young man -- his father, after all, had been one of the kingdom's richest men -- but did not take him seriously. Within a week, King Fahd had agreed to the American proposal, carried by Richard Cheney, then the secretary of defense, to station American soldiers -- ''infidel armies'' -- in the Land of the Two Holy Places. This momentous decision led to bin Laden's final break with the Saudi dynasty. 
 The American presence, and the fatal decision to leave American forces stationed in Saudi Arabia as a trip wire or deterrent even after Hussein had been defeated, provided bin Laden with a critical propaganda point, for it gave to his worldview, of a Muslim world under relentless attack, and its central argument, that the ''unjust and renegade ruling regimes'' of the Islamic world were in fact ''enslaved by the United States,'' a concrete and vivid reality. The ''near enemies'' and their ruthless security services had proved resistant to direct assault, and the time had come to confront directly the one antagonist able to bring together all the jihadists in a single great battle: the ''far enemy'' across the sea.

IV. The deaths of nearly 3,000 people, the thousands left behind to mourn them, the great plume hanging over Lower Manhattan carrying the stench of the vaporized buildings and their buried dead: mass murder of the most abominable, cowardly kind appears to be so at the heart of what happened on this day four years ago that it seems beyond grotesque to remind ourselves that for the attackers those thousands of dead were only a means to an end. Not the least disgusting thing about terrorism is that it makes objects of human beings, makes use of them, exploits their deaths as a means to accomplish something else: to send a message, to force a concession, to advertise a cause. Though such cold instrumentality is not unknown in war -- large-scale bombing of civilians, ''terror bombing,'' as it used to be known, does much the same thing -- terrorism's ruthless and intimate randomness seems especially appalling.
 Terror is a way of talking. Those who employed it so unprecedentedly on 9/11 were seeking not just the large-scale killing of Americans but to achieve something by means of the large-scale killing of Americans. Not just large-scale, it should be added: spectacular. 
 The asymmetric weapons that the 19 terrorists used on 9/11 were not only the knives and box cutters they brandished or the fuel-laden airliners they managed to commandeer but, above all, that most American of technological creations: the television set. On 9/11, the jihadists used this weapon with great determination and ruthlessness to attack the most powerful nation in the history of the world at its point of greatest vulnerability: at the level of spectacle. They did it by creating an image, to repeat Peter Jennings's words, ''beyond our imagination.''
 The goal, first and foremost, was to diminish American prestige -- showing that the superpower could be bloodied, that for all its power, its defeat was indeed conceivable. All the major attacks preceding 9/11 attributed at least in part to Al Qaeda -- the shooting down of U.S. Army helicopters in Mogadishu in 1993, the truck-bombing of American military housing at Khobar in 1996, the car-bombing of the American embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam in 1998, the suicide-bombing of the U.S.S. Cole in Aden in 2000 -- were aimed at the same goal: to destroy the aura of American power. Power, particularly imperial power, rests not on its use but on its credibility; U.S. power in the Middle East depends not on ships and missiles but on the certainty that the United States is invincible and stands behind its friends. The jihadis used terrorism to create a spectacle that would remove this certainty. They were by no means the first guerrilla group to adopt such a strategy. ''History and our observation persuaded us,'' recalled Menachem Begin, the future Israeli prime minister who used terror with great success to drive the British out of Palestine during the mid-1940's, ''that if we could succeed in destroying the government's prestige in Eretz Israel, the removal of its rule would follow automatically. Thenceforward, we gave no peace to this weak spot. Throughout all the years of our uprising, we hit at the British government's prestige, deliberately, tirelessly, unceasingly.'' In its most spectacular act, in July 1946, the Irgun guerrilla forces led by Begin bombed the King David Hotel, killing 91 people, most of them civilians.
 The 9/11 attacks were a call to persuade Muslims who might share bin Laden's broad view of American power to sympathize with, support or even join the jihad he had declared against the ''far enemy.'' ''Those young men,'' bin Laden said of the terrorists two months after the attacks, ''said in deeds, in New York and Washington, speeches that overshadowed all other speeches made everywhere else in the world. The speeches are understood by both Arabs and non-Arabs -- even by Chinese.. . .[I]n Holland, at one of the centers, the number of people who accepted Islam during the days that followed the operations were more than the people who accepted Islam in the last 11 years.'' To this, a sheik in a wheelchair shown in the videotape replies: ''Hundreds of people used to doubt you, and few only would follow you until this huge event happened. Now hundreds of people are coming out to join you.'' Grotesque as it is to say, the spectacle of 9/11 was meant to serve, among other things, as an enormous recruiting poster. 
 But recruitment to what? We should return here to the lessons of Afghanistan, not only the obvious one of the defeat of a powerful Soviet Army by guerrilla forces but the more subtle one taught by the Americans, who by clever use of covert aid to the Afghan resistance tempted the Soviets to invade the country and thereby drew ''the Russians into an Afghan trap.'' Bin Laden seems to have hoped to set in motion a similar strategy. According to a text attributed to Saif al-Adel, a former Egyptian Army colonel now generally identified as bin Laden's military chief, ''the ultimate objective was to prompt'' the United States ''to come out of its hole'' and take direct military action in an Islamic country. ''What we had wished for actually happened. It was crowned by the announcement of Bush Jr. of his crusade against Islam and Muslims everywhere.'' (''This is a new kind of evil,'' the president said five days after the attacks, ''and we understand. . .this crusade, this war on terrorism, is going to take a while.'')
 The 9/11 attacks seem to have been intended at least in part to provoke an overwhelming American response: most likely an invasion of Afghanistan, which would lead the United States, like the Soviet Union before it, into an endless, costly and politically fatal quagmire. Thus, two days before the attacks, Qaeda agents posing as television journalists taping an interview murdered Ahmed Shah Massoud, the charismatic leader of the Northern Alliance, with a bomb concealed in a video camera -- apparently a pre-emptive strike intended to throw into confusion the United States' obvious ally in the coming invasion of Afghanistan.
 For the jihadists, luring the Americans into Afghanistan would accomplish at least two things: by drawing the United States into a protracted guerrilla war in which the superpower would occupy a Muslim country and kill Muslim civilians -- with the world media, including independent Arab networks like Al Jazeera, broadcasting the carnage -- it would leave increasingly isolated those autocratic Muslim regimes that depended for their survival on American support. And by forcing the United States to prosecute a long, costly and inconclusive guerrilla war, it would severely test, and ultimately break, American will, leading to a collapse of American prestige and an eventual withdrawal -- first, physically, from Afghanistan and then, politically, from the ''apostate regimes'' in Riyadh, Cairo and elsewhere in the Islamic world. 
 In his ''Declaration of Jihad'' in 1996, bin Laden focused on American political will as the United States' prime vulnerability, the enemy's ''center of gravity'' that his guerrilla war must target and destroy. ''The defense secretary of the crusading Americans had said that 'the explosions at Riyadh and Al-Khobar had taught him one lesson: that is, not to withdraw when attacked by cowardly terrorists.' We say to the defense secretary, Where was this false courage of yours when the explosion in Beirut took place in 1983?
 ''But your most disgraceful case was in Somalia.. . .When tens of your soldiers were killed in minor battles and one American pilot was dragged in the streets of Mogadishu, you left the area carrying disappointment, humiliation, defeat and your dead with you.. . .The extent of your impotence and weaknesses became very clear.''
 In Afghanistan, bin Laden would be disappointed. The U.S. military initially sent in no heavy armor but instead restricted the American effort to aerial bombardment in support of several hundred Special Operations soldiers on the ground who helped lead the Northern Alliance forces in a rapid advance. Kabul and other cities quickly fell. America was caught in no Afghan quagmire, or at least not in the sort of protracted, highly televisual bloody mess bin Laden had envisioned. But bin Laden and his senior leadership, holed up in the mountain complex of Tora Bora, managed to survive the bombing and elude the Afghan forces that the Americans commissioned to capture them. During the next months and years, as the United States and its allies did great damage to Al Qaeda's operational cadre, arresting or killing thousands of its veterans, its major leadership symbols survived intact, and those symbols, and their power to lead and to inspire, became Al Qaeda's most important asset. 
 After Tora Bora, the Qaeda fighters who survived regrouped in neighboring countries. ''We began to converge on Iran one after the other,'' Saif al-Adel recalled in a recent book by an Egyptian journalist. ''We began to form some groups of fighters to return to Afghanistan to carry out well-prepared missions there.'' It is these men, along with the reconstituted Taliban, that 16,000 American soldiers are still fighting today.
 Not all the fighters would return to Afghanistan. Other targets of opportunity loomed on the horizon of the possible. ''Abu Mus'ab and his Jordanian and Palestinian comrades opted to go to Iraq,'' al-Adel recalled, for, he said, an ''examination of the situation indicated that the Americans would inevitably make a mistake and invade Iraq sooner or later. Such an invasion would aim at overthrowing the regime. Therefore, we should play an important role in the confrontation and resistance.'' 
 Abu Mus'ab is Abu Mus'ab al-Zarqawi -- or A.M.Z. to the American troops who are pursuing him and his Qaeda in Mesopotamia forces all over the shattered landscape of occupied Iraq. The United States, as Al Qaeda had hoped, had indeed come out of its hole.

V. It was strangely beautiful, the aftermath of the explosion in Baghdad: two enormous fires, bright orange columns of flame rising perhaps 20 feet into the air, and clearly discernible in the midst of each a cage of glowing metal: what remained of two four-wheel-drive vehicles. Before the flames, two bodies lay amid a scattering of glass and sand; the car bomb had toppled the sandbags piled high to protect the building, collapsing the facade and crushing a dozen people. It was Oct. 27, 2003, and I stood before what remained of the Baghdad office of the International Committee of the Red Cross. In the distance, I heard a second huge explosion, saw rising the great plume of oily smoke; within the next 45 minutes, insurgents attacked four more times, bombing police stations throughout the capital, killing at least 35. Simultaneity and spectacle: Qaeda trademarks. I was gazing at Zarqawi's handiwork.
 Behind me, the press had gathered, a jostling crowd of aggressive, mostly young people bristling with lenses short and long, pushing against the line of young American soldiers, who, assault rifles leveled, were screaming at them to stay back. The scores of glittering lenses were a necessary part of the equation, transforming what in military terms would have been a minor engagement into a major defeat.
 ''There is no war here,'' an American colonel told me a couple of days before in frustration and disgust. ''There's no division-on-division engagements, nothing really resembling a war. Not a real war anyway.'' 
 It was not a war the Americans had been trained or equipped to fight. With fewer than 150,000 troops -- and many fewer combat soldiers -- they were trying to contain a full-blown insurgency in a country the size of California. The elusive enemy -- an evolving, loose coalition of a score or so groups, some of them ex-Baathists from Saddam Hussein's dozen or so security agencies, some former Iraqi military personnel, some professional Islamic insurgents like Zarqawi, some foreign volunteers from Saudi Arabia or Kuwait or Syria come to take the jihad to the Americans -- attacked not with tanks or artillery or infantry assaults but with roadside bombs and suicide car bombers and kidnappings. Iraq, bin Laden declared, had become a ''golden opportunity'' to start a ''third world war'' against ''the crusader-Zionist coalition.'' 
 Amid the barbed wire and blast walls and bomb debris of post-occupation Iraq, you could discern a clear strategy behind the insurgent violence. The insurgents had identified the Americans' points of vulnerability: their international isolation; their forced distance, as a foreign occupier, from Iraqis; and their increasing disorientation as they struggled to keep their footing on the fragile, shifting, roiling political ground of post-Hussein Iraq. And the insurgents hit at each of these vulnerabilities, as Begin had urged his followers to do, ''deliberately, tirelessly, unceasingly.'' 
 When, during the summer of 2003, the Bush administration seemed to be reaching out to the United Nations for political help in Iraq, insurgents struck at U.N. headquarters in Baghdad, killing the talented envoy Sergio Vieira de Mello and 21 others and driving the United Nations from the country. When the Americans seemed to be trying to attract Arab forces to come to Iraq to help, the insurgents struck at the Jordanian Embassy, killing 17. When the Turks offered to send troops, the insurgents bombed the Turkish Embassy. When nongovernmental organizations seemed the only outsiders still working to ease the situation in Iraq, insurgents struck at the Red Cross, driving it and most other nongovernmental organizations from the country. 
 Insurgents in Iraq and jihadists abroad struck America's remaining allies. First they hit the Italians, car-bombing their base in Nasiriyah in November 2003, killing 28. Then they struck the Spanish, bombing commuter trains in Madrid on March 11, 2004, killing 191. Finally they struck the British, bombing three London Underground trains and a double-decker bus this July, killing 56. It is as if the insurgents, with cold and patient precision, were severing one by one the fragile lines that connected the American effort in Iraq to the rest of the world. 
 With car bombs and assassinations and commando attacks, insurgents have methodically set out to kill any Iraqi who might think of cooperating with the Americans, widening the crevasse between occupiers and occupied. They have struck at water lines and electricity substations and oil pipelines, interrupting the services that Iraqis depended on, particularly during the unbearably hot summers, keeping electrical service in Baghdad far below what it was under Saddam Hussein -- often only a few hours a day this summer -- and oil exports 300,000 barrels a day below their prewar peak (helping to double world oil prices). Building on the chaotic unbridled looting of the first weeks of American rule, the insurgents have worked to destroy any notion of security and to make clear that the landscape of apocalyptic destruction that is Baghdad, with its omnipresent concrete blast walls and rolls of concertina wire and explosions and gunshots, should be laid at the feet of the American occupier, that unseen foreign power that purports to rule the country from behind concrete blast walls in the so-called Green Zone but dares to venture out only in tanks and armored cars.
 ''With. . .officials attempting to administrate from behind masses of barbed wire, in heavily defended buildings, and. . .living in pathetic seclusion in 'security zones,' one cannot escape the conclusion that the government. . .is a hunted organization with little hope of ever being able to cope with conditions in this country as they exist today.'' However vividly these words fit contemporary Baghdad, they are in fact drawn from the report of the American consul general in Jerusalem in 1947, describing what Begin's guerrilla forces achieved in their war against the British. ''The very existence of an underground,'' as Begin remarked in his memoirs, ''must, in the end, undermine the prestige of a colonial regime that lives by the legend of its omnipotence. Every attack which it fails to prevent is a blow to its standing.''
 In Iraq, the insurgents have presided over a catastrophic collapse in confidence in the Americans and a concomitant fall in their power. It is difficult to think of a place in which terror has been deployed on such a scale: there have been suicide truck bombs, suicide tanker bombs, suicide police cars, suicide bombers on foot, suicide bombers posing as police officers, suicide bombers posing as soldiers, even suicide bombers on bicycles. While the American death toll climbs steadily toward 2,000, the number of Iraqi dead probably stands at 10 times that and perhaps many more; no one knows. Conservative unofficial counts put the number of Iraqi dead in the war at somewhere between 25,000 and 30,000, in a country a tenth the size of the United States. 
 Civil wars, of course, are especially bloody, and a civil war is now being fought in Iraq. The country is slowly splitting apart along the lines where French and British negotiators stitched it together early in the last century out of three Ottoman provinces -- Mosul, Baghdad and Basra -- and it is doing so with the enthusiastic help of the Islamists, who are doing all they can to provoke a Shia-Sunni regionwide war.
 The Kurds in the north, possessed of their own army and legislature, want to secure what they believe are their historic rights to the disputed city of Kirkuk, including its oil fields, and be quit of Iraq. The Shia in the south, now largely ruled by Islamic party militias trained by the Iranians and coming under the increasingly strict sway of the clerics on social matters, are evolving their oil-rich mini-state into a paler version of the Islamic republic next door. And in the center, the Baathist elite of Saddam Hussein's security services and army -- tens of thousands of well-armed professional intelligence operatives and soldiers -- have formed an alliance of convenience with Sunni Islamists, domestic and foreign, in order to assert their rights in a unitary Iraq. They are in effective control of many cities and towns, and they have the burdensome and humiliating presence of the foreign occupier to thank for the continuing success of their recruitment efforts. In a letter to bin Laden that was intercepted by American forces in January 2004, Zarqawi asked: ''When the Americans disappear. . .what will become of our situation?''
 As Zarqawi described in his letter and in subsequent broadcasts, his strategy in Iraq is to strike at the Shia -- and thereby provoke a civil war. ''A nation of heretics,'' the Shia ''are the key element of change,'' he wrote. ''If we manage to draw them onto the terrain of partisan war, it will be possible to tear the Sunnis away from their heedlessness, for they will feel the weight of the imminence of danger.'' Again a strategy of provocation -- which plays on an underlying reality: that Iraq sits on the critical sectarian fault line of the Middle East and that a conflict there gains powerful momentum from the involvement of neighboring states, with Iran strongly supporting the Shia and with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Jordan and Syria strongly sympathetic to the Sunnis. More and more, you can discern this outline in the chaos of the current war, with the Iranian-trained militias of the Shia Islamist parties that now control the Iraqi government battling Sunni Islamists, both Iraqi and foreign-born, and former Baathists. 
 In the midst of it all, increasingly irrelevant, are the Americans, who have the fanciest weapons but have never had sufficient troops, or political will, to assert effective control over the country. If political authority comes from achieving a monopoly on legitimate violence, then the Americans, from those early days when they sat in their tanks and watched over the wholesale looting of public institutions, never did achieve political authority in Iraq. They fussed over liberalizing the economy and writing constitutions and achieving democracy in the Middle East when in fact there was really only one question in Iraq, emerging again and again in each successive political struggle, most recently in the disastrously managed writing of the constitution: how to shape a new political dispensation in which the age-old majority Shia can take control from the minority Sunni and do it in a way that minimized violence and insecurity -- do it in a way, that is, that the Sunnis would be willing to accept, however reluctantly, without resorting to armed resistance. This might have been accomplished with hundreds of thousands of troops, iron control and a clear sense of purpose. The Americans had none of these. Instead they relied first on a policy of faith and then on one of improvisation, driven in part by the advice of Iraqi exile ''friends'' who used the Americans for their own purposes. Some of the most strikingly ideological decisions, like abruptly firing and humiliating the entire Iraqi Army and purging from their jobs many hundreds of thousands of Baath Party members, seemed designed to alienate and antagonize a Sunni population already terrified of its security in the new Iraq. ''You Americans,'' one Sunni businessman said to me in Baghdad last February, shaking his head in wonder, ''you have created your own enemies here.''
 The United States never used what authority it had to do more than pretend to control the gathering chaos, never managed to look clearly at the country and confront Iraq's underlying political dysfunction, of which the tyranny of Saddam Hussein was the product, not the cause. ''The illusionists,'' Ambassador John Negroponte's people called their predecessors, the officials of the Coalition Provisional Authority under L. Paul Bremer III. Now, day by day, the illusion is slipping away, and with it what authority the Americans had in Iraq. What is coming to take its place looks increasingly like a failed state.

VI. It is an oft-heard witticism in Washington that the Iraq war is over and that the Iranians won. And yet the irony seems misplaced. A truly democratic Iraq was always likely to be an Iraq led not only by Shia, who are the majority of Iraqis, but by those Shia parties that are the largest and best organized -- the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq and the Dawa Islamic Party -- which happen to be those blessed by the religious authorities and nurtured in Iran. Nor would it be a surprise if a democratic Saudi Arabia turned out to be a fundamentalist Saudi Arabia and one much less friendly to the United States. Osama bin Laden knows this, and so do American officials. This is why the United States is ''friendly'' with ''apostate regimes.'' Democratic outcomes do not always ensure friendly governments. Often the contrary is true. On this simple fact depends much of the history of American policy not only in the Middle East but also in Latin America and other parts of the world throughout the cold war. Bush administration officials, for all their ideological fervor, did the country no favor by ignoring it.
 In launching his new cold war, George W. Bush chose a peculiarly ideological version of cold-war history. He opted not for containment, the cautious, status quo grand strategy usually attributed to the late George F. Kennan, but for rollback. Containment, by which the United States determinedly resisted Soviet attempts to expand its influence, would have meant a patient, methodical search for terrorists, discriminating between those groups that threaten the United States and those that do not, pursuing the former with determined, practical policies that would have drawn much from the military and law-enforcement cooperation of our allies and that would have included an effective program of nonproliferation to keep weapons of mass destruction out of terrorist hands. Rollback, on the other hand, meant something quite different; those advocating it during the 1950's considered containment immoral, for it recognized the status quo: Communist hegemony in Eastern Europe and parts of Asia. They wanted instead to destroy Communism entirely by ''rolling back'' Communists from territory they had gained, as Gen. Douglas MacArthur did briefly and, it turned out, catastrophically, in North Korea, and as President Eisenhower refused to do when he declined to support the Hungarian revolutionaries against the Soviet invasion in 1956. 
 The original advocates of rollback lost that struggle. In this new cold war, the rollback advocates triumphed and adopted as the heart of their policy a high-stakes, metaphysical gamble to ''democratize the Middle East'' and thus put an end, once and for all, to terrorism. They relied on a ''domino theory'' in which the successful implantation of democracy in Iraq would lead to a ''democratic revolution'' across the region. The ambition of this idea is breathtaking; it depends on a conception of American power as virtually limitless and on an entirely fanciful vision of Iraqi politics, a kind of dogged political wish-fulfillment that no sober analysis could penetrate. Replacing any real willingness to consider whether a clear course existed between here and there, between an invasion and occupation of Iraq and a democratic Middle East, was, at bottom, the simple conviction that since the United States enjoyed a ''preponderance of power'' unseen in the world since the Roman Empire, and since its cause of democratic revolution was so incontrovertibly just, defeat was inconceivable. One detects here an echo of Vietnam: the inability to imagine that the all-powerful United States might lose.
 American power, however, is not limitless. Armies can destroy and occupy, but it takes much more to build a lasting order, especially on the shifting sands of a violent political struggle: another Vietnam echo. Learning the lesson this time around may prove more costly, for dominoes can fall both ways. ''Political engineering on this scale could easily go awry,'' Stephen D. Biddle, a U.S. Army War College analyst, wrote this past April in a shrewd analysis. ''If a democratic Iraq can catalyze reform elsewhere, so a failed Iraq could presumably export chaos to its neighbors. A regionwide Lebanon might well prove beyond our capacity to police, regardless of effort expended. And if so, then we will have replaced a region of police states with a region of warlords and chronic instability. This could easily prove to be an easier operating environment for terrorism than the police states it replaces.'' 
 The sun is setting on American dreams in Iraq; what remains now to be worked out are the modalities of withdrawal, which depend on the powers of forbearance in the American body politic. But the dynamic has already been set in place. The United States is running out of troops. By the spring of 2006, nearly every active-duty combat unit is likely to have been deployed twice. The National Guard and Reserves, meanwhile, make up an unprecedented 40 percent of the force, and the Guard is in the ''stage of meltdown,'' as Gen. Barry McCaffrey, retired, recently told Congress. Within 24 months, ''the wheels are coming off.'' For all the apocalyptic importance President Bush and his administration ascribed to the Iraq war, they made virtually no move to expand the military, no decision to restore the draft. In the end, the president judged his tax cuts more important than his vision of a ''democratic Middle East.'' The administration's relentless political style, integral to both its strength and its weakness, left it wholly unable to change course and to add more troops when they might have made a difference. That moment is long past; the widespread unpopularity of the occupation in Iraq and in the Islamic world is now critical to insurgent recruitment and makes it possible for a growing insurgent force numbering in the tens of thousands to conceal itself within the broader population.
 Sold a war made urgent by the imminent threat of weapons of mass destruction in the hands of a dangerous dictator, Americans now see their sons and daughters fighting and dying in a war whose rationale has been lost even as its ending has receded into the indefinite future. A war promised to bring forth the Iraqi people bearing flowers and sweets in exchange for the beneficent gift of democracy has brought instead a kind of relentless terror that seems inexplicable and unending. A war that had a clear purpose and a certain end has now lost its reason and its finish. Americans find themselves fighting and dying in a kind of existential desert of the present. For Americans, the war has lost its narrative.
 Of the many reasons that American leaders chose to invade and occupy Iraq -- to democratize the Middle East; to remove an unpredictable dictator from a region vital to America's oil supply; to remove a threat from Israel, America's ally; to restore the prestige sullied on 9/11 with a tank-led procession of triumph down the avenues of a conquered capital; to seize the chance to overthrow a regime capable of building an arsenal of chemical and biological weapons -- of all of these, it is remarkable that the Bush administration chose to persuade Americans and the world by offering the one reason that could be proved to be false. The failure to find the weapons of mass destruction, and the collapse of the rationale for the war, left terribly exposed precisely what bin Laden had targeted as the critical American vulnerability: the will to fight.
 How that collapse, reflected in poll numbers, will be translated into policy is a more complicated question. One of 9/11's more obvious consequences was to restore to the Republicans the advantage in national security they surrendered with the cold war's end; their ruthless exploitation of this advantage and the Democrats' compromising embrace of the Iraq war has in effect left the country, on this issue, without an opposition party. Republicans, who fear to face the voters shackled to a leader whose approval ratings have slid into the low 40's, are the ones demanding answers on the war. The falling poll numbers, the approaching midterm elections and the desperate manpower straits of the military have set in motion a dynamic that could see gradual American withdrawals beginning in 2006, as Gen. George W. Casey Jr., the commander in Iraq, acknowledged publicly in July. Unless Iraq's political process, which has turned another downward spiral with Sunni negotiators' rejection of the constitution, can somehow be retrieved, American power in Iraq will go on deteriorating. 
 Two and a half years into the invasion, for U.S. policy in Iraq, the time of ''the illusionists'' has finally passed. Since the January elections, which Sunnis largely boycotted, American officials have worked hard to persuade Sunni leaders to take part in the constitutional referendum and elections, hoping thereby to isolate the Baathist and Islamist extremists and drain strength from the insurgency. This effort comes very late, however, when Iraqi politics, and the forces pulling the country apart, have taken on a momentum that waning American power no longer seems able to stop. Even as the constitutional drama came to a climax last month, the president telephoned Abdul Aziz Hakim, the Shia cleric who leads the Sciri Party, appealing for concessions that might have tempted the Sunnis to agree to the draft; the Shia politician, faced with the American president's personal plea, did not hesitate to turn him down flat. Perhaps the best hope now for a gradual American withdrawal that would not worsen the war is to negotiate a regional solution, which might seek an end to Sunni infiltration from U.S. allies in exchange for Shia guarantees of the Sunni position in Iraq and a phased American departure.
 For all the newfound realism in the second-term administration's foreign policy, in which we have seen a willingness finally to negotiate seriously with North Korea and Iran, the president seems nowhere close to considering such an idea in Iraq, insisting that there the choice is simple: the United States can either ''stay the course'' or ''cut and run.'' ''An immediate withdrawal of our troops in Iraq, or the broader Middle East, as some have called for,'' the president declared last month, ''would only embolden the terrorists and create a staging ground to launch more attacks against America and free nations.'' These words, familiar and tired, offering no solution beyond staying a course that seems to be leading nowhere, have ceased to move Americans weary of the rhetoric of terror. That does not mean, however, that they may not be entirely true.

VII. We cannot know what future Osama bin Laden imagined when he sent off his 19 suicide terrorists on their mission four years ago. He got much wrong; the U.S. military, light years ahead of the Red Army, would send no tank divisions to Afghanistan, and there has been no uprising in the Islamic world. One suspects, though, that if bin Laden had been told on that day that in a mere 48 months he would behold a world in which the United States, ''the idol of the age,'' was bogged down in an endless guerrilla war fighting in a major Muslim country; a world in which its all-powerful army, with few allies and little sympathy, found itself overstretched and exhausted; in which its dispirited people were starting to demand from their increasingly unpopular leader a withdrawal without victory -- one suspects that such a prophecy would have pleased him. He had struck at the American will, and his strategy, which relied in effect on the persistent reluctance of American leaders to speak frankly to their people about the costs and burdens of war and to expend the political capital that such frank talk would require, had proved largely correct.
 He has suffered damage as well. Many of his closest collaborators have been killed or captured, his training camps destroyed, his sanctuary occupied. ''What Al Qaeda has lost,'' a senior Defense Department official said five months after the attacks, ''again, it's lost its center of gravity.. . .The benefits of Afghanistan cannot be overestimated. Again, it was the one state sponsor they had.'' This analysis seems now a vision of the past. Al Qaeda was always a flexible, ghostly organization, a complex worldwide network made up of shifting alliances and marriages of convenience with other shadowy groups. Now Al Qaeda's ''center of gravity,'' such as it is, has gone elsewhere. 
 In December 2003, a remarkable document, ''Jihadi Iraq: Hopes and Dangers,'' appeared on the Internet, setting out a fascinating vision of how to isolate the United States and pick off its allies one by one. The truly ripe fruit, concludes the author, is Spain: ''In order to force the Spanish government to withdraw from Iraq the resistance should deal painful blows to its forces. . .[and] make utmost use of the upcoming general election.. . .We think that the Spanish government could not tolerate more than two, maximum three blows, after which it will have to withdraw.. . .''
 Three months later, on March 11, 2004 -- 3/11, as it has come to be known -- a cell of North African terrorists struck at the Atocha Train Station in Madrid. One hundred ninety-one people died -- a horrific toll but nowhere near what it could have been had all of the bombs actually detonated, simultaneously, and in the station itself. Had the terrorists succeeded in bringing the roof of the station down, the casualties could have surpassed those of 9/11.
 In the event, they were quite sufficient to lead to the defeat of the Spanish government and the decision of its successor to withdraw its troops from Iraq. What seems most notable about the Madrid attack, however -- and the attack on Jewish and foreign sites in Casablanca on May 17, 2003, among others -- is that the perpetrators were ''home-grown'' and not, strictly speaking, Al Qaeda. ''After 2001, when the U.S. destroyed the camps and housing and turned off the funding, bin Laden was left with little control,'' Marc Sageman, a psychiatrist and former C.I.A. case officer who has studied the structure of the network, has written. ''The movement has now degenerated into something like the Internet. Spontaneous groups of friends, as in Madrid and Casablanca, who have few links to any central leadership, are generating sometimes very dangerous terrorist operations, notwithstanding their frequent errors and poor training.''
 Under this view, Al Qaeda, in the form we knew it, has been subsumed into the broader, more diffuse political world of radical Salafi politics. ''The network is now self-organized from the bottom up and is very decentralized,'' Sageman wrote. ''With local initiative and flexibility, it's very robust.''
 We have entered the era of the amateurs. Those who attacked the London Underground -- whether or not they had any contact with Al Qaeda -- manufactured their crude bombs from common chemicals (including hydrogen peroxide, bleach and drain cleaner), making them in plastic food containers, toting them to Luton Station in coolers and detonating them with cellphone alarms. One click on the Internet and you can pull up a Web site offering a recipe -- or, for that matter, one showing you how to make a suicide vest from commonly found items, including a video download demonstrating how to use the device: ''There is a possibility that the two seats on his right and his left might not be hit with the shrapnel,'' the unseen narrator tells the viewer. Not to worry, however: ''The explosion will surely kill the passengers in those seats.''
 During the four years since the attacks of 9/11, while terrorism worldwide has flourished, we have seen no second attack on the United States. This may be owed to the damage done Al Qaeda. Or perhaps planning and preparation for such an attack is going on now. When it comes to the United States itself, the terrorists have their own ''second-novel problem'' -- how do you top the first production? More likely, though, the next attack, when it comes, will originate not in the minds of veteran Qaeda planners but from this new wave of amateurs: viral Al Qaeda, political sympathizers who nourish themselves on Salafi rhetoric and bin Laden speeches and draw what training they require from their computer screens. Very little investment and preparation can bring huge rewards. The possibilities are endless, and terrifyingly simple: rucksacks containing crude homemade bombs placed in McDonald's -- one, say, in Times Square and one on Wilshire Boulevard, 3,000 miles away, exploded simultaneously by cellphone. The effort is small, the potential impact overwhelming.
 Attacks staged by amateurs with little or no connection to terrorist networks, and thus no visible trail to follow, are nearly impossible to prevent, even for the United States, with all of its power. Indeed, perhaps what is most astonishing about these hard four years is that we have managed to show the world the limits of our power. In launching a war on Iraq that we have been unable to win, we have done the one thing a leader is supposed never to do: issue a command that is not followed. A withdrawal from Iraq, rapid or slow, with the Islamists still holding the field, will signal, as bin Laden anticipated, a failure of American will. Those who will view such a withdrawal as the critical first step in a broader retreat from the Middle East will surely be encouraged to go on the attack. That is, after all, what you do when your enemy retreats. In this new world, where what is necessary to go on the attack is not armies or training or even technology but desire and political will, we have ensured, by the way we have fought this forever war, that it is precisely these qualities our enemies have in large and growing supply.

HEADLINE: Energy Ideas, Good and Bad

 BODY:
Congress has bounded back into post-Katrina Washington full of ideas about controlling gasoline prices and improving the energy picture generally. Some make sense and some are colossally bad.
 In the latter category is the notion that consumers would be better off if the government acted by fiat, imposing price controls on gasoline or suspending gas taxes. A lot of otherwise level-headed people have spoken sympathetically about one or the other, including Senators Carl Levin, Maria Cantwell, Jon Corzine and Charles Schumer. 
They might not like what might well happen: a sudden and unhealthy spike in consumption, gas lines and, in effect, rationing. Artificially low prices caused by caps or tax relief would encourage people to buy more gas when they should be curbing demand, as the market is telling them to do. The gas stays affordable, but there is less of it. 
 Sure, everyone wants to make things better. But it is hard to see how to do that in the long run by doing the wrong things now. And as a matter of leadership, pandering to consumers squanders an opportunity to educate people on the need for sacrifice, just when a major crisis has presumably made them more open to change.
 Speaking of change, a growing number of senators now seem open to requiring better fuel economy standards for automobiles. Chief among the converts is Pete Domenici, the Senate's most influential Republican on energy matters. Mr. Domenici seems a bit remorseful that the energy bill he helped steer through Congress this summer did nothing to improve fuel economy, the swiftest way to reduce oil demand and, in time, prices. 
 Mr. Domenici would also ask the oil companies to increase refinery capacity. This is a good idea. A completely new refinery has not been built in this country for nearly 40 years, which means supplies are tight and prices high. 
 More controversially, Mr. Domenici will press to open the outer continental shelf off America's coast to oil and gas drilling. Katrina has given new life generally to those who operate on the mistaken assumption that we can drill our way out of oil dependency and high prices. The only sure relief will come through improved fuel efficiency.

HEADLINE: Thumbing Nervously Through the Conservative Rulebook 

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

 BODY:
IN a simpler time, before they controlled the House, the Senate and the White House, conservatives knew what they believed about the federal government. It was too big, too bloated, too prone to throw money at problems in foolhardy efforts at social engineering. It was almost always wiser to trust the states and local governments -- or better yet, individual initiative and local charities.
 After five years in power, though, conservatives have found those first principles challenged, again and again, by the messy realities of governing. They hoped to limit government's role in Medicare; they ended up with a vast expansion of the entitlement. They hoped to pare back federal spending; they ended up with rising spending and substantial deficits. Their vision of an ''ownership society,'' with individuals taking more responsibility (and risk) for their retirement and health savings, has proved a hard sell with the American public. 
 Now conservative beliefs about the proper size and role of the federal government -- the limits of compassionate conservatism -- are facing, perhaps, their greatest domestic test. What is the appropriate conservative response to Hurricane Katrina and the devastation it left? What role should the federal government play in the rebuilding of New Orleans? Simply rely on the magic of the private market, encouraged by big tax breaks and regulatory relief, or try to social-engineer a safer, more equitable city? 
 And what lessons should conservatives draw about the performance of government, at all levels, in disaster relief? 
 Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House and a principal architect of the 1994 Republican takeover of Congress, argues that this is nothing less than a transformational moment in American politics that demands a new conservative response. ''I think the challenge to Republicans now is you have the House, you have the Senate, you have the White House, you had better so thoroughly reform this government that people believe you can deliver,'' he said.
 It is hardly a theoretical debate. So far, Congress has approved more than $60 billion to deal with Katrina, and spending is expected to quickly surpass $100 billion. Conservatives are already making decisions on Capitol Hill and in the White House, very quickly, and under fire from the Democrats. For many, it is painful. Leading fiscal conservatives acknowledge that the federal government will -- and should -- spend generously on disaster relief, but argue that President Bush and Congress should find some of that money elsewhere in the federal budget.
 The conservative Heritage Foundation suggested that members of Congress should return some of the billions earmarked for special projects in the recent highway bill and use that money in New Orleans. More practically, Representative Mike Pence, chairman of the Republican Study Committee, an influential group of 100 conservative House members, suggested conservatives will increasingly resist the White House and their party leadership if they fail to cut the budget elsewhere to cover the new Katrina costs.
 ''I was very troubled that the administration sent a request for more than $50 billion to the Hill without so much as a recommended cut,'' he said. 
 Conservatives are also debating, among themselves, the implications of what is widely seen as a faltering, confused and slow governmental response to Katrina. 
 Some, notably the libertarian Cato Institute, argue that the bureaucratic failures only reflect the need to reduce the size of the federal government. Chris Edwards, a Cato analyst, compares the federal government to ''a fat, bloated conglomeration that should shed other functions that divert it from the core functions'' -- like some specific forms of disaster relief.
 Grover Norquist, a leading advocate of substantially reducing the federal government, argued that the disaster only underlined the need for more tax cuts to spur the economy. ''Step one is you deal with the problem -- rebuild New Orleans,'' he said, ''and step two, you enact economic policies so you can afford to rebuild New Orleans.'' 
 But Representative Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican and a staunch believer in limited federal government, worried that the post-Katrina reaction shows ''people have a more expansive view about what the role of the federal government is or ought to be than is warranted by the Constitution or the principles of good governance.'' 
 Still, many conservatives themselves no longer share the traditional belief in reining in the federal government wherever possible -- most notably, in recent years, championing a far more interventionist foreign policy in Iraq and beyond. And for those committed to the idea of a strong executive, particularly on domestic security, the response to Katrina was troubling. The focus, they say, should be less on the size of the government than on how it performed.
 William Kristol, the editor of The Weekly Standard, the conservative magazine, said there clearly needed to be more ''energy in the executive,'' as Alexander Hamilton would put it, in the first days after the hurricane. ''Personally, I don't have a problem saying maybe conservatives should favor more spending in some areas of security, disaster relief,'' he said. ''That's a pretty core function of government from a conservative standpoint. This isn't Great Society, New Age, government feel-good kind of stuff.''
 Some conservatives are debating how to create, if not a Great Society in New Orleans, at least a renewed and perhaps more prosperous one. Representative Flake said the recovery efforts can showcase conservative ideas like vouchers for education and health care, and new efforts to encourage home ownership. Mr. Gingrich, in a memo circulated last week, called for the creation of a ''Zone of Recovery, Reconstruction and Prosperity'' with huge tax breaks to encourage investment and jobs -- overseen by an ''entrepreneurial public manager'' with the power to coordinate all federal activities.
 Inevitably, all this discussion could challenge the status quo. John DiIulio, who initially led the Bush administration's faith-based initiative, argues, ''The bigger government has gotten, the less we've thought through effective public administration.''
 Two trends that should be examined, he said: ''government by proxy,'' shifting administrative responsibilities for an array of federal programs to state and local governments and private entities; and the role Congress plays in defining, and endlessly redefining, what agencies should do. (Both are politically difficult for a Republican Congress, which has supported both trends, to confront.)
 Whatever emerges, of course, will look less like an ideology and more like a compromise fashioned to meet a vast and immediate need. Conservatives have already learned that lesson with the Medicare prescription drug bill and with a budget strained by a costly war.
 Franklin Roosevelt, the great pragmatist and architect of much of the federal government, knew it well. Asked how he would explain the political philosophy behind the Tennessee Valley Authority, he replied, ''I'll tell them its neither fish nor fowl,'' he said. ''But whatever it is, it will taste awfully good to the people of the Tennessee Valley.''

HEADLINE: Founding Father Seeks Common Sense

BYLINE: By DAVID SCHARFENBERG

DATELINE: NEW ROCHELLE 

 BODY:
IN the spring of 1806 William Carver, a blacksmith and veterinarian, left his home in New York City and traveled north to New Rochelle to visit his old friend Thomas Paine, the thinker whose political tract ''Common Sense'' had inspired the American Revolution 30 years before.
 Paine was in a miserable state. Drunk, depressed and disheveled, he wore a ripped shirt ''nearly the colour of tanned leather,'' Carver was later quoted as saying. And he ''had the most disagreeable smell possible, just like that of our poor beggars in England.''
After two years of country living, the once formidable author had been humbled by old age, financial pressures and a growing sense of isolation. A move to New York City, with Carver's assistance, did not do much good. On June 8, 1809, after shuttling from one temporary lodging to the next, Paine died bedridden at 72, admired by some, reviled by others and forgotten by many. 
 Since then, admirers have worked to bolster his legacy as a founding father, slavery opponent and fierce critic of the church who, some historians say, never quite got his due. One such effort came in 1925 here in New Rochelle, on the site of Paine's old farm, where an aging Thomas Edison and other members of the fledgling Thomas Paine National Historical Association built a small museum dedicated to his memory.
 Today the museum still sits on North Avenue, adjacent to the cottage where Paine once lived. But the museum has been buffeted by years of declining membership and infighting; like the Paine of 1806, it is something of a wreck. Not only are the gutters rotting and the roof leaking, but valuable early editions of Paine's writings lie in a messy, poorly secured safe room with no climate control. And to add insult to injury, Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer's office is now investigating the association.
 ''It's really a tragedy,'' said Harvey J. Kaye, a history professor at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay whose recently published ''Thomas Paine and the Promise of America'' analyzes Paine's life and legacy.
 The attorney general's inquiry is rooted in the association's June sale of several Paine writings, for $289,000, to William Reese, a widely respected private book dealer in New Haven. The most valuable item, which commanded $125,000, was a rare first-edition, first-issue copy of ''Common Sense,'' inscribed by Henry Wisner, a New York delegate to the Continental Congress. Other items in the sale included seven further copies of ''Common Sense,'' three volumes of essays in Paine's wartime series ''The Crisis,'' a poem, a legislative document signed by Paine and two letters.
 The transaction has upset local historians as well as several former board members -- a far-flung group given to demonstrating their enthusiasm for Paine with distinctive e-mail addresses and vanity license plates bearing his name. Worshipful of books and memorabilia that hold enduring inspiration, these devotees lament the transfer of precious historical documents from public to private hands. 
 Brian McCartin, the association's president and one of four members remaining on the board, counters that the group needs the proceeds to stay afloat, to renovate its crumbling building and to improve preservation and security efforts.
 The investigation has left both the sale and the museum upgrade in limbo. And Mr. Reese, the book dealer, has agreed to refrain from reselling the works until the inquiry runs its course.
 Mr. Spitzer's office has remained tight-lipped about its precise focus. But the inquiry, according to Mr. McCartin and others interviewed by state attorneys, appears to turn on a state law requiring certain nonprofit corporations to seek court permission before selling ''all or substantially all'' of their assets.
 Michael Munisteri, the Colgate-Palmolive executive who serves as the association's treasurer, argues that the items in question do not amount to ''substantially all'' of the group's holdings. The association, after all, owns several other early editions of Paine's writings, along with a lock of his hair, his writing kit and the museum building.
 But William Josephson, a former assistant attorney general in charge of the charities bureau, says the courts do not necessarily interpret ''substantially all'' as a certain percentage of a museum's net worth. Objects central to a museum's collection, whatever their financial value, may also be covered by the statute.
 If the attorney general's office determined that the transaction was improper, Mr. Josephson added, it could work through the courts to invalidate the sale, appoint a receiver or, in an extreme case, dissolve the association and distribute its collection to other museums.
 Regardless of the legal issues involved, said Ed Able, president and chief executive of the American Association of Museums in Washington, any museum that sells objects to repair its infrastructure violates ethical standards laid out by his organization and several others in the field.
 The principle at the heart of these standards, according to Mr. Able, is that the contents of a museum's collection are not financial assets on a par with land or a building, but precious objects held as part of a public trust. Ethics codes dictate that proceeds from any sale of such protected items be used to finance new acquisitions to a collection, or to subsidize the direct care of remaining ones -- not to fix a leaking roof.
 Gary Berton, an association board member and Paine devotee who lives in Renovo, Pa., argues that the museum is in such poor shape, and so vulnerable to a heavy rainstorm, that repairing the building amounts to direct care for the collection.
 ''The very room in which the items are housed is in jeopardy,'' he pointed out. 
 But at least a half-dozen former board members -- the association once had 12 -- say they do not trust the judgment or stewardship of the four remaining members.
 One of them, Kenneth Burchell, who lives in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, is a Paine aficionado who compares reading ''The Age of Reason'' in 1980 to being struck by a lightning bolt. He accuses the remaining board members of misspending money -- including a $10,000 gift earmarked for support of an annual fund-raising dinner that no longer exists.
 Mr. Berton acknowledges that the group has borrowed from that fund to cover other expenses and admits that a repayment program has faltered during lean times. But he says that if the attorney general approves the sale of the Paine writings, the fund will be replenished.
 Jeffrey Block, a former association treasurer who is also from Coeur d'Alene, says the group has improperly categorized Mr. McCartin as a private contractor rather than as an employee -- in an effort to avoid contributions to the unemployment insurance program and other expenses. Mr. McCartin, whose only compensation is a two-bedroom apartment above the museum, defends that categorization, saying that if he were considered an employee for tax purposes, it would only bring financial hardship on an already struggling association.
 But above all it is the sale of Paine's writings that disturbs the aficionados. Large Paine collections are of course available at other institutions, like the New-York Historical Society in Manhattan and the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia. They are not, however, of much consolation to Richard Cuneo, a former board member who is a telephone company manager from Ringwood, N.J. He said he became sick to his stomach when he learned that the association had sold writings to a private dealer, removing them from the public domain.
 ''When kids actually see things and touch them,'' he said of the documents, ''it stays with them the rest of their lives. That's the real crime.''

HEADLINE: Highway 61, Visited

 BODY:
IN his recently published memoir, ''Chronicles: Volume One,'' Bob Dylan describes what may or may not be a typical night at home. He and a houseguest, Bono of U2, stay up all night and polish off a case of Guinness while talking about their shared literary hero Jack Kerouac and their mutual love of back-roads America. ''I told him that if he wants to see the birthplace of America, he should go to Alexandria, Minn.,'' where, he explains, ''the Vikings came and settled in the 1300's.'' 
 Mr. Dylan then becomes Bono's unbidden tour guide, mapping out a road trip with specific instructions to follow an unnamed roadway along ''the river up through Winona, Lake City, Frontenac.''
Curious, I opened a road atlas to discover that the only road that follows the Mississippi through those towns is Highway 61, the fabled Blues Highway that runs from the Mississippi Delta through Duluth, where Mr. Dylan was born, and that Mr. Dylan mythologized in his 1965 masterpiece ''Highway 61 Revisited.'' 
 I don't know if Bono ever made the trip, but if he did, he was in for some surprises. So I discovered in early June when, armed with a stack of Dylan CD's and accompanied by my former college roommate Doc Wilson, now a Chicago-based neuropsychologist, I drove from Winona to Alexandria, using Mr. Dylan's directions to Bono as my map. I ignored the Interstate -- the town sits alongside I-94, about two hours west of Minneapolis the way most people drive it -- and instead took the much longer route Mr. Dylan suggested. Obviously, Mr. Dylan, who grew up 150 miles northeast of Alexandria, in the remote Mesabi Iron Range town of Hibbing, wanted his Irish friend to see the countryside of his native state.
 Or, was Mr. Dylan, the maddeningly enigmatic songwriter whose line from the ''John Wesley Harding'' album, ''nothing is revealed,'' pretty well describes ''Chronicles'' -- a memoir so bare of personal detail that the reader never learns the name of the wife puttering around in the background as Bob and Bono guzzle their Guinness -- cryptically sharing the secret of exactly how he goes about painting his masterpieces?
 Before going further, I should point out that I am not an obsessed Dylan fan. I have seen Mr. Dylan live fewer than 50 times. Yes, I own all his albums, on vinyl or CD, as well as a Triumph Motorcycles T-shirt identical to the one Mr. Dylan wears on the cover of ''Highway 61,'' my favorite Dylan album. But I have never pawed through Mr. Dylan's garbage, crawled out his window or stomped across his roof as have less restrained fans whom he flays in ''Chronicles.'' ''I wanted to set fire to these people,'' he writes.
 The man has no need to be nervous on account of me. As evidence that I am not deranged in my admiration of Mr. Dylan, the Kodak Christmas card I had made from a backstage photo of the two of us (I have witnesses who will corroborate that Mr. Dylan willingly posed) bears the inscription ''Bob Dylan's Dream'' -- his, not mine.
 To many observers, Mr. Dylan always seemed a tad too dark, too brooding, too hip to enjoy the warm embrace of his fair-haired fellow Minnesotans. Even now, the rest of the world seems to be in his thrall. Two new albums are in stores (well, one, ''Bob Dylan: Live at the Gaslight 1962,'' is sold exclusively in Starbucks; the other, ''No Direction Home: The Soundtrack -- The Bootleg Series Vol. 7,'' is being distributed without the latte), and a documentary, also called ''No Direction Home,'' by Martin Scorsese, is to be broadcast on PBS on Sept. 26 and 27. But in his home state he certainly enjoys nowhere near the iconic status of Elvis in Tennessee or even Britney in Louisiana.
 For instance, the annual Highway 61 festival near Duluth, held each August, is more blues than Bob-oriented, and the chamber of commerce in Hibbing, where the closest thing to a Dylan museum is a modest exhibit in the local library (unless you count Zimmy's, a bar and memorabilia-packed restaurant), only recently began to celebrate Mr. Dylan's birthday each May. 
 Even certain Dylanesque references proved to be misleading. ''You can't get more Bob than that,'' I thought when I saw the ''Positively Minnesota'' branding slogan that was featured a few months ago on the official Web site of the state tourism bureau (exploreminnesota.com). But a woman from the bureau told me that the phrase was not taken from Mr. Dylan's ''Positively Fourth Street'' but a bit of boosterism borrowed from the state's Department of Employment and Economic Development.
 She also mentioned that her office received far more calls from visitors inquiring about Judy Garland, favorite daughter of Grand Rapids, where the annual Judy Garland festival attracts big crowds, than about Mr. Dylan. Consulting her computer to see if she was overlooking any Dylan-related tourist sites, she said, ''He spells it D-i-l-l-o-n, right?'' So it occurred to me when I set out from New York to spend three days on the Dylan Trail, that while I'm not technically obsessed, it's probably true that I am a bit more Bobbed-up than the next guy.
 AFTER flying into the Minneapolis airport. where I met Doc Wilson and rented a Lincoln Town Car -- the titular model featured in ''From a Buick 6'' on ''Highway 61'' was not available -- we began our road trip in Winona.
 Following a night at the patriotically named AmericInn on the Mississippi River's west-bank levee -- and setting out on an itinerary spelled out on Pages 174 and 175 of Mr. Dylan's memoir -- we headed north on 61, passing beneath Sugar Loaf, a dramatic limestone outcropping that protrudes from a 500-foot river bluff where Sioux tribes once conducted religious ceremonies. Subsequent Winonans have been less reverent: abandoned warehouses and colorless grain elevators stand shoulder to shoulder along the west river bank, blocking the view of the Mississippi and verdant Wisconsin beyond.
 A few miles out of town, I spotted an unexpected road sign. Turning off the four-lane Highway 61, I followed County Road 248 two miles west through lush and rolling truck farm and pasture land to a farming hamlet.
 Entering Rollingstone, Minn., population 697.
 As every Dylan fan knows, the opening line of the title song of ''Highway 61'' -- ''Oh God said to Abraham 'kill me a son''' -- was plucked from Genesis. But who knew that the inspiration for ''61,'' as well as the album's most famous song, ''Like a Rolling Stone,'' might have come not from Mr. Dylan's Bible but from his road atlas?
 As we pulled up in front of the Rollingstone Feed & Grain store, the first-take bootleg album version of the song blasted by chance from the car's CD player. ''Coincidence?'' Doc said, hinting that the unseen hand was mine, ''or science?''
 Founded by emigres from the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg in the 1850's, the town makes no attempt to promote its connection, intended or not, to what has to be among the most lavishly praised and thoroughly deconstructed tunes in pop music history.
 Voted the greatest rock 'n' roll song ever written by none other than Rolling Stone magazine, the tune is also the subject of ''Like a Rolling Stone: Bob Dylan at the Crossroads -- An Explosion of Vision and Humor That Forever Changed Pop Music.'' That's the full title of Greil Marcus's 283-page book about the recording and impact of that single song.
 As it happened, we arrived in what Doc called ''just like Rollingstone'' on June 15, 1965, exactly 40 years to the month after Dylan recorded the song, an anniversary lost on the town fathers. There are no plaques commemorating the town's namesake or even plans to adopt ''Like a Rolling Stone'' as the town song. The town does not hold Dylan Days festivities and there are no chamber of commerce booster campaigns: ''No Direction Home? Visit Rollingstone!'' 
 Back on the highway, Doc and I followed the Mississippi as it curved wide and muddy between skyscraping bluffs sculptured by glaciers and smoothed by wind and water. We passed through Wabasha, where posters remind visitors that the town was the setting for the ''Grumpy Old Men'' films and the National Eagle Center offers tips for birders who flock to the surrounding bluffs to watch bald eagles make their seasonal migrations. 
 At Lake City, where the Mississippi widens into Lake Pepin, strollers on a two-mile riverfront walkway can look out upon waters where an 18-year-old Ralph W. Samuelson is said to have ''discovered'' the sport of water skiing in 1922.
 Upriver at Red Wing, once Dakota territory where chiefs were known by the more lugubrious title ''wing of the wild swan dyed scarlet,'' more bluffs offer sweeping views of the river and the surrounding countryside. The town is the birth and burial place of Frances Densmore, the music historian known as Writing Down Woman who recorded the voices of hundreds of American Indians, including Geronimo, and earned her name as the author of many books and articles about their music.
 The town was also the setting of a mournful early Dylan tune, ''Walls of Red Wing,'' about a reformatory, the Minnesota State Training School for Boys, a Gothic castle whose brick walls still loom as forbiddingly as Attica's near the banks of the Mississippi.
 Highway 61 turns westward at Red Wing, crossing the Mississippi at Hastings, where it joins U.S. 10, a heavily congested truck-and-commuter divided four-lane that skirts the Twin Cities and curves to the northwest while 61 continues north to Duluth. In stark contrast to the green, undulating river valley that 61 winds through, U.S. 10 slices in long straightaways through mostly flat, sparsely wooded prairie and farm country.
 Feeling antsy after a stretch of hours when the monotony was broken only by a roadside stand selling old buckboards and a coverless prairie schooner, Doc said, ''About now is when Bono starts singing 'I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For.' ''
 At Wadena, a dusty freight rail crossing about 50 miles northwest of Little Falls, the prairie town where Charles Lindbergh was brought up, we stopped for the night at a motel and tavern restaurant efficiently named the Inn & Grill.
 One hundred miles to the northwest, in Fargo, N.D., a little-known but portentous moment in rock 'n' roll history occurred when, on the night after Buddy Holly died in a plane crash on the way to a gig there in February 1959, an 18-year-old piano player named Robert Zimmerman (later known to the world as Bob Dylan) sat in with a fellow Minnesotan, Bobby Vee, whose band was conscripted at the last minute to fill Holly's place on the bill.
 After dinner, Doc turned in early, and I had a few beers in the bar, where the off-duty waitresses were watching drag races on ESPN and drinking bottled wine coolers and schnapps, boilermaker style, by pouring the wine cooler into a tumbler and dropping in a jigger of schnapps, shot glass and all.
 ''My fiance doesn't think it's ladylike to get tools for shower gifts,'' said one waitress, an enthusiastic auto mechanic whose bridal registry was for the local hardware store, ''but that's what I want.''
 The next morning we will set off early for our final destination, Alexandria and the Runestone Museum, wherein lies proof -- or not -- that a party of Vikings camped in the area 130 years before Columbus discovered an island chain off the coast of North America. If true, the Norsemen penetrated thousands of miles farther inland from their known North American settlement at Vinland, in present-day Newfoundland, than most historians believe.
 I asked a waitress what she knew about the museum and its Kensington Runestone, a large, flat rock that bears a runic inscription supposedly carved by Vikings in 1362, and about a local farmer named Olaf Ohlman who was said to have found tangled in the roots of an aspen tree as he cleared his property for planting in 1898. She was in agreement with the bartender and the all the other waitresses.
 ''Never heard of it,'' she said.
 The legend may not have reached Wadena, 50 miles north of the site, where the stone, left by survivors of an Indian massacre as a warning to Vikings who might follow, is displayed in the museum. But it left a lasting impression on Mr. Dylan. He recalled telling Bono that ''there's a wooden statue of a Viking in Alexandria,'' referring to Big Ole, the 25-foot Norse warrior that stands guard outside the Runestone Museum, ''and it doesn't look anything like a dignified founding father of America. He's bearded, wears a helmet, strapped knee-high boots, long dagger in a sheath, holding a spear at his side, wearing a kilt -- holding a shield that says, 'The birthplace of America.'''
 Strange as it was to see the fierce visage of the towering Viking exactly as described in ''Chronicles'' standing at the end of a side street in downtown Alexandria, I was more startled when Doc, a man of science normally not given to flights of poesy, recited a poem by Shelley that sounded like it was written about Big Ole himself:
 ''My nameis Ozymandias, King of Kings; Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!'' ''Hey,'' I groused when he finished, ''I'm supposed to be the literary one.''
 The statue, it turns out, was built for Minnesota's state pavilion at the 1964-65 World's Fair in New York and later bought by the town and installed outside the museum. An attention-getter in his own right, Big Ole helped draw nearly 8,000 visitors to the Runestone Museum last year.
 ''A nice write-up in the AAA guidebook also helped,'' the museum's manager, Julie Blank, said as she walked us through the museum, which has impressive displays of rare Indian and pioneer artifacts as well as an extensive and well-balanced collection of material devoted to the discovery and controversy surrounding the Runestone. 
 More than a century after Ohlman dug it up, Runestone's authenticity is still being argued. Rusted but still deadly looking medieval Norse battle-axes unearthed by settlers in the early 1800's, along with iron eyelets used by Vikings to moor their ships and river boats, bolster the claims of local historians. They believe parties of Viking explorers sailed west via the Hudson Bay and traveled south to Minnesota by navigating and portaging between a then-far more extensive network of rivers, streams and lakes.
 SOME locals even say that early settlers found bands of fair-skinned, light-haired natives living in the Dakota territories who are believed to be descendants of 14th-century Vikings. Others say it is all bunk and that Ohlman perpetuated an elaborate hoax.
 Ms. Blank and Barbara Grover, a former president of the Alexandria Historical Society and a current member of the Runestone Museum's board, are among the believers, as are many visitors who seem swayed by the museum's displays, which are convincing without being heavy-handed.
 As for that other local legend, Ms. Blank doesn't recall ever seeing Mr. Dylan or his friend Bono visiting the museum. But Ms. Grover does recall an incident that might give Dylanologists -- and Bono -- pause.
 ''Sure, I remember Bobby Zimmerman,'' said Ms. Grover, who in the late 50's and early 60's ran a coffeehouse called the 10 O'Clock Scholar in Dinkytown, Minneapolis's student quarter. Mr. Dylan mentions the place in his book as a refuge where he practiced the six-string Martin guitar he traded for the electric guitar he had played throughout his teens.
 According to Ms. Glover, years before Mr. Dylan was booed at the Newport Folk Festival for going electric, he was kicked off stage at the 10 O'Clock Scholar for going acoustic. ''He was awful,'' Ms. Grover said. ''He couldn't play and he couldn't sing. We had to kick him out. I made my husband tell him because I didn't have the heart.''

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Sept. 11 about Highway 61 and its link to Bob Dylan misstated the date the author and a friend visited Rollingstone, Minn. It was June 15, 2005, not 1965. It was on that date in 1965 that Dylan recorded the song ''Highway 61 Revisited.''

HEADLINE: Suddenly, Those Solar Panels Don't Look So 1970's

BYLINE: By TIM GRAY

 BODY:
AS prices for coal, natural gas and oil have soared, solar power has been getting perhaps its most serious look from investors since President Jimmy Carter pulled on a cardigan and asked Americans to damp their furnaces. The new interest means that the handful of domestic solar stocks has been surging, too.
 Over the last year, the shares of Evergreen Solar, DayStar Technologies, Energy Conversion Devices and Spire -- all small domestic companies that make equipment for converting solar power into electricity -- have more than doubled in price. In August, Cypress Semiconductor said it would try to raise as much as $100 million in an initial public offering for its SunPower subsidiary.
''The solar market is projected to grow 35 percent a year for the next three to five years,'' said Walter V. Nasdeo, managing director of Ardour Capital, an investment bank in New York that specializes in energy companies. ''As these technologies get better, we're seeing things being developed like solar panels integrated into roofing tiles. That way, they don't look like a science project hanging on your roof.'' 
 Back in the days of President Carter's cardigan, the country was mired in an energy crisis, with an oil embargo and long lines at gas stations. Today, tumult in oil-producing places like the Middle East and Venezuela is roiling markets. Strong demand for electricity has contributed to increases in the prices of coal and natural gas. And Hurricane Katrina, of course, has worsened the situation. Yet these dire developments have been a boon for companies that make devices such as silicon wafers and rooftop panels that convert solar energy.
 Until recently, the economics of the solar business did not tempt many consumers or investors. Without government or utility subsidies, the $20,000 to $25,000 that it costs to buy and install a typical home solar system may be too much to be recouped in the time it takes to pay off a 30-year mortgage. 
 But government help, combined with the recent climb in energy prices, has made solar systems more appealing. Some states offer big subsidies, helping to defray much of the initial cost of a home system. 
 Some electric utilities also offer incentives. In theory, solar systems free them from having to invest in additional power-generation capacity. Homeowners typically connect their systems to the power grid and buy electricity when their panels don't produce enough power and sell it to their utility when they have a surplus.
 Federal law requires utilities to buy excess power generated by consumers' solar power systems -- though rates vary from state to state, said Joseph E. Schwartz, chief executive and technical editor of Home Power magazine. And the new federal energy law, signed by President Bush last month, includes a tax credit of as much as $2,000 for the purchase and installation of a residential solar power system.
 ''Despite all of the concerns about imported oil and climate change, most people make their decision to install solar based on whether they're going to save money,'' said Steven C. Taub, director of emerging-generation technologies at Cambridge Energy Research Associates. In states with generous subsidies, he said, solar power systems may be attractive for many consumers. In New Jersey, for example, subsidies can cover up to about 70 percent of the cost -- leaving consumers with a net cost of about $6,000 on a typical home system.
 Though the four little domestic solar power companies stand to benefit from new demand for power, they account for only a small fraction of the world's solar-device production. The biggest of the four, Energy Conversion Devices, has a market capitalization of only about $1.1 billion. 
 Giants like BP and Royal Dutch Shell in the energy industry, or Sharp and Kyocera in electronics, make most solar gear. Last year, the solar industry produced 1,195 megawatts of new electricity-generation capacity -- about the equivalent of one large power plant, Mr. Taub said. Sharp alone accounted for about 325 megawatts, he said.
 Yet solar energy conversion is a tiny part of these hefty companies' sales, so the little independents are a purer play. The business lines of Evergreen and DayStar are almost entirely related to solar power (as are those of Cypress's SunPower). Energy Conversion Devices has other products, but its largest subsidiary, United Solar Ovonics, also known as Uni-Solar, is a solar power business. And Spire's solar division accounted for an average of 40 percent of the company's sales in 2003 and 2004.
 Of course, investing in small-capitalization stocks can be risky. Besides being microbes in an industry dominated by giants, none of the four independents were profitable last year. Two have short histories as public companies: Evergreen went public in 2002, and DayStar did so last year. All but Spire are developing new solar technologies, and there is no guarantee that customers will embrace their innovations.
 The most popular means of converting the sun's energy into electricity -- silicon-based solar panels -- has progressed over the last three decades but hasn't changed radically. Silicon is used to make wafers, which are wired to create solar cells. These form the building blocks for solar panels, which look like big storm windows, sit atop roofs and soak up the sun.
 A silicon shortage has driven up the cost of solar-grade silicon by more than 60 percent over the last two years, said Michael Rogol, an analyst at Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia. That offers an opportunity to companies like Evergreen and SunPower that have devised more efficient ways to use silicon, he said.
 Evergreen's wafer-making method consumes about a third less silicon than usual, said Richard M. Feldt, its president and chief executive. Many competitors saw blocks of silicon into wafers; that creates waste in the same way a lumberyard spits out sawdust. Evergreen's method, which draws out long ribbons of silicon and slices them with lasers, produces less waste.
 EXECUTIVES at Cypress Semiconductor in Sunnyvale, Calif., declined to be interviewed because of the impending stock offering. But Mr. Rogol says its SunPower unit makes the industry's most efficient cells, yielding 210 watts of power a square meter, versus 180 for a typical cell.
 DayStar, for its part, ditches silicon entirely, while Uni-Solar uses far less than average. DayStar, based in Halfmoon, N.Y., applies a thin film of several elements, including copper, to backings such as titanium foil to create flexible solar cells. 
 Uni-Solar marries the thin-film method with silicon. ''Our panels are typically 18 feet long with an adhesive on the back,'' said Subhendu Guha, its president. ''You can stick it directly onto the roof. With the traditional product, you have to have a support structure.''
 Spire, in Bedford, Mass., produces neither silicon wafers nor solar cells. It makes machinery for building and testing solar panels. In 1999, that enabled it to team up with the city of Chicago to equip and run a panel factory there. Roger G. Little, Spire's chairman and chief executive, says he sees the Chicago venture as a harbinger of Spire's future; he aims to increase panel production over the next two years.
 That would return Spire to its roots. The company started in 1969; early on, it concentrated on solar power conversion. It diversified into biomedical equipment and electronics after energy crisis of the late 1970's abated and enthusiasm for solar power cooled. ''The market tanked,'' Mr. Little recalled. Even so, he remained confident.
 ''I've always believed that solar is a freight train that can't be stopped,'' he said. ''It started small, but the compound annual growth rate for the last 10 years has been 20 percent. This year, there's a $10 billion worldwide market for systems.''

HEADLINE: Agencies Acquired In Separate Deals

BYLINE: By Melanie Warner

 BODY:
Three agency acquisitions have been made in recent days.
 The Epsilon division of Alliance Data Systems in Dallas reached an agreement to acquire Bigfoot Interactive in New York for about $120 million. 
Investors in Bigfoot include J.P. Morgan Partners and Flatiron Partners.
Al DiGuido, chief executive at Bigfoot, will become president of Epsilon Interactive. Bigfoot specializes in e-mail marketing campaigns for advertisers like American Honda Motor and Expedia. 
 Separately, Ventiv Health in Somerset, N.J., is acquiring inChord Communications in Westerville, Ohio, for $185 million in cash and stock. InChord, parent of agencies like GSW Worldwide, will become a unit of Ventiv, and Blane Walter, chairman and chief executive of inChord, will become president of the Ventiv communications division.
 InChord specializes in advertising and marketing services for pharmaceutical and health care companies. The purchase price may be increased if inChord meets certain financial targets after the acquisition.
 Also, the Cossette Communication Group in Montreal is making another acquisition in the British advertising market, buying a majority stake in Miles Calcraft Briginshaw Duffy in London and in the London agency's direct-marketing unit, named Elvis, as part of a three-stage, six-year deal.
 Cossette will initially pay about 16.8 million Canadian dollars ($14.3 million) for a 51 percent stake in Miles Calcraft and Elvis, which work for clients like the BBC, Cadbury Schweppes and Diageo. The deal terms permit Cossette to increase the stake to 75 percent and then 100 percent. Cossette made its first acquisitions in Britain in 2003 and 2004.

HEADLINE: Coastal Cities Of Mississippi In the Shadows

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON

DATELINE: GULFPORT, Miss., Sept. 11 

 BODY:
Past the razor wire that has been rolled out along the unusable railroad tracks separating the heavily damaged neighborhoods from the destroyed neighborhoods lies the port that gave this city its name. 
 Put generously, it is a mess. The cargo containers are scattered for miles, the poultry freezers are destroyed and 7,300 jobs are in limbo. In the middle of one of the major terminals sits a casino, the Copa, one of a fleet of floating gambling houses that had revitalized the Gulf Coast, pumping taxes into city, county and state governments and providing jobs to some 15,000 people.
Now officials say 8 of the 12 floating casinos appear to be damaged beyond repair, including the Copa, which is slumped onshore, a big pink box with its guts exposed. 
 If the levees had held in New Orleans, the destruction wrought on the Mississippi Gulf Coast by Hurricane Katrina would have been the most astonishing storm story of a generation. Whole towns have been laid flat, thousands of houses washed away and, statewide, the storm has been blamed for the deaths of 211 people, a toll far higher than those from Hurricanes Andrew, Hugo and Ivan.
 But as it is, Mississippi -- like the Pentagon on Sept. 11, 2001 -- is coping with an almost unimaginable catastrophe, largely overshadowed in the news media's attention and the national consciousness, in this case by the disaster in New Orleans.
 On Sunday night, President Bush began his third visit to the region since the storm hit.
 Two weeks since the hurricane, Gulfport and the neighboring city of Biloxi are no longer fighting for mere survival. Power has been restored to everyone who can receive it, gasoline is flowing at the stations and water is gradually beginning to trickle from faucets, though it is still undrinkable. There is even a man in a pizza costume enticing customers to a local Papa John's.
 But, as the community breathes a collective sigh of relief, the tougher question is beginning to arise: now what?
 ''It looks like we're going to have to build an economy from the ground up'' said Connie Rockco, one of the five supervisors of Harrison County, where Gulfport and Biloxi are located. 
 The casinos employed thousands of people but city and county officials said that just as many were employed in businesses directly related to the casinos, like spas, high-end restaurants, martini bars and pawn shops. About 30,000 people, they estimated, were dependent on the crowds that came to gamble.
 ''What are they going to do?'' Ms. Rockco said. ''I mean, they're done.''
 In Biloxi, where most of the gambling business was located, individual casinos were 7 of the top 10 local taxpayers in 2004, pumping $11.6 million into the city's general fund, and an additional $11.6 million into local school and public safety departments. 
 City revenues for Gulfport and Biloxi are also heavily dependent on the sales tax and property tax, neither of which is going to be pouring in while tourists are absent, residents are struggling to find money for basic needs and thousands of homes are gone. Harrison County officials estimated that anywhere from a quarter to a third of the county's people are now homeless. Most of the homeowners did not have flood insurance, federal data has shown.
 Before the first floating casino opened in 1992, both Biloxi and Gulfport were cities in decline. The seafood industry had been hurting for years because of cheaper foreign imports, and the completion of Interstate 10 across southern Mississippi made it easier for tourists to bypass the Mississippi Coast for the Florida beaches. By the end of the 1980's, Biloxi was actually losing people.
 But in 1990 the State Legislature voted to allow riverboat gambling and the coastal economy became addicted, quickly. 
 Tourists began flocking to the area, hotels began sprouting and the retail economy boomed. The towns of Long Beach and Pass Christian -- both of which were leveled by Hurricane Katrina -- were flourishing as bedroom communities for Gulfport and New Orleans. 
 Recently, as coastal real estate has grown scarcer in Florida, a condominium boom had been barreling toward Mississippi's coast. There were more than 50 condominium projects awaiting permits before the hurricane hit, potentially representing thousands of new residents, Harrison County officials said.
 The projects had been coming in so fast that several coastal towns had adopted building moratoriums, buying time to figure out how to handle the influx. Now, of course, a surplus of housing is not a problem.
 ''All the things people came to see us for are in disarray,'' said Pam Ulrich, the Harrison County administrator. 
 Chevis C. Swetman is the third-generation president of the Peoples Bank in Biloxi. He is currently sleeping on an air mattress in the bank's conference room. As city officials begin talking eagerly of rebuilding, Mr. Swetman, who lost 6 of his 16 branches, is less sanguine. 
 ''After Camille you had something to start with,'' he said. ''You had a roof over your head.''
 Mr. Swetman, like most everyone else here, believes the fate of the Gulf Coast lies with the casinos. And, like everyone else, he believes they will inevitably return, on land this time if the Legislature goes along. 
 ''We're going to recover,'' he said. ''Just how fast?'' 
 Last week, Mr. Swetman and officials from other banks on the Gulf Coast had a conference call with William H. Losner, the president of First National Bank of South Florida. Homestead, Fla., where Mr. Losner's bank is based, was flattened by Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and he was consulted by the bankers as one who knows something about rebuilding.
 ''We thought it would take us 3 to 5 years to recover,'' Mr. Losner said he told the bankers. ''It took us 11 years.'' 
 But already, local officials are excitedly talking about the hurricane as if it were, in some ways, a brutal but effective urban redesigner, solving infrastructure problems that the cities had been wrestling with for years. 
 The railroad tracks that run through the center of both cities -- carrying trains that were only on their way to someplace else -- had become a nuisance and even a danger. Now that many of the bridges are down and some of the tracks are tied into pretzels, city officials are planning to lobby the freight railroad CSX, the owner of the tracks, to move them farther north. A spokesman for CSX said it was too early in the rebuilding phase for that to be considered.
 Brent Warr, who has been the mayor of Gulfport for two months, has no doubt that his city will bounce back from Hurricane Katrina.
 ''Property values are going to skyrocket here,'' Mr. Warr said in an interview. ''All the unattractive stuff has been blown away. The attractive stuff has been blown away, too, but we can rebuild that.''
 In Biloxi, which is about 200 years older than Gulfport, some things may be gone for good.
 The East End of Biloxi, an old neighborhood of Balkan immigrants and Cajuns whose fathers and grandfathers arrived years ago as fishermen, was wiped out.
 The houses did not follow the current building codes and the mostly low- and middle-income district was in a prime real estate area, near the casinos. 
 The Vietnamese immigrant shrimpers, many of whom lived -- and still live -- in their boats, and who operated what was left of the area's shrimping industry, are unlikely to find work anytime soon. The harbors are destroyed and the shrimp freezers are gone. 
 Many of the older, lifelong Biloxi and Gulfport residents, quite a few of whom stayed because they had lived through Hurricane Camille in 1969 and figured they could live through Hurricane Katrina, lost everything and are unlikely to have the energy to rebuild their seaside homes. Ideally, Mr. Warr said, they would move into the condominiums that officials are still expecting to rise along the coast.
 ''We have an opportunity now to make it an absolutely unique place,'' he said. ''God has come in and wiped the slate clean for us.''

HEADLINE: Koizumi's Party, Backing Reforms, Wins by Landslide

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 11 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's Liberal Democratic Party won by a wider than expected landslide in Japan's general election on Sunday, earning a popular mandate to push through market reforms in the world's second largest economy.
 The magnitude of the victory reversed the decade-long decline of the Liberal Democratic Party, which has ruled Japan nearly continuously for 50 years but had depended increasingly on its junior coalition partner, the New Komeito Party, to govern effectively. The results were a devastating setback for the Democratic Party, the main opposition, whose gains in recent elections had raised expectations that Japanese democracy was maturing into an era of two-party rule.
The results, reinforced by a high voter turnout, also amounted to a huge personal victory for Mr. Koizumi, who called an early election last month after rebellious members of his own party had rejected his bill to privatize Japan's postal service, the world's largest financial institution with $3 trillion in assets and an important part of the Japanese postwar political and economic structure. 
 In an election that Mr. Koizumi had successfully framed as a referendum on restructuring the postal services and making other economic reforms, his triumph suggested that voters agreed with his vision of invigorating Japan's economy, which has only started recovering from years of stagnation. 
 The Liberal Democratic Party won 296 seats in the 480-seat lower house of Parliament, up from 249 when the election was called. The Democratic Party's share of seats dropped to 113 from 175.
 Along with the 31 seats held by the New Komeito Party, the Liberal Democratic Party will have more than the two-thirds of the lower house's seats to overrule decisions by the upper house, which voted down the postal bill.
 ''I thought it would be O.K. for the L.D.P. to get a simple majority, but people gave us even better results than we had expected,'' Mr. Koizumi said of his party. ''I'm overwhelmed with gratitude.
 ''I think the people handed down a verdict that postal reform is right,'' he said from the party's headquarters.
 The victory by Mr. Koizumi, who has been one of the strongest backers of the American-led war in Iraq and enjoys a personal relationship with President Bush, will be welcomed in Washington. But it is likely to be greeted with caution in Asia, especially in China and South Korea, which view with trepidation the rightward tilt and rising nationalism in Japan on Mr. Koizumi's watch.
 Mr. Koizumi's repeated visits to Yasukuni Shrine, the memorial where war criminals are deified, have harmed relations with China, whose booming economy has lifted Japan's. After his victory on Sunday, Mr. Koizumi, who has pledged to visit the shrine every year, said he had not changed his position.
 During the 12-day campaign, Mr. Koizumi succeeded in narrowing the electorate's focus to postal reform and domestic issues. The main opposition Democratic Party -- which opposed the Yasukuni visits, pledged to withdraw Japanese troops from Iraq and repair relations with China and South Korea -- failed to widen the focus to issues that could have hurt Mr. Koizumi at the ballot.
 ''I firmly believe our stance to focus on our policies was not wrong,'' said the Democratic Party leader, Katsuya Okada. ''Our message didn't reach the people.''
 Mr. Okada announced that he would step down as party leader because of the loss. Analysts have said that a big loss could lead to the breakup of the Democratic Party, which was formed in 1998 by former Liberal Democrats, Socialists and other members.
 Other parties vying in the election opposed postal privatization but, in an appeal to the deep-rooted popular feeling that Japan needs to transform itself to move forward, said they supported political and economic reforms. But by making postal privatization -- an arcane issue little understood by most voters -- a litmus test for reform, Mr. Koizumi was able to paint its opponents, including the Democratic Party, as reactionaries. 
 ''This election shows how Koizumi is in a league of his own in his political skills and media savvy,'' said Gerald Curtis, an expert on Japanese politics at Columbia University who is visiting Tokyo. ''He did the impossible. He managed to convince the electorate that his party, which was opposed to his own reforms, was for change, and that the Democratic Party, which was a party founded for reform, was against change.''
 Mr. Koizumi wants to break up and privatize Japan Post, which in addition to delivering mail holds $3 trillion in savings and life insurance deposits that politicians have dipped into for decades to finance public works and reward their backers. He has said that it is the prerequisite for further, if vaguely defined, reforms in the Japanese economy, the world's second largest behind that of the United States.
 In his four years in office, Mr. Koizumi's economic policies, including reductions in public spending and the cleaning of bad loans from the banking sector, have been faulted by some economists for not going far enough. But there is also a sense in Japan, which has always had ambivalent feelings toward American-style capitalism at home, that the policies have hurt the Japanese and helped create a society of economic losers and winners.
 Opponents of postal reform said Japan's peculiar postal system, for all its faults, also helped create an egalitarian society by spreading wealth from urban to rural areas.
 ''If things keep going like this, this will be the end of Japan,'' Shizuka Kamei, a postal rebel who was expelled from the Liberal Democratic Party by Mr. Koizumi but was reelected as a member of a new party, said Sunday night on Japanese television.
 By replacing postal opponents with younger, mostly female candidates, Mr. Koizumi succeeded in changing the image of the Liberal Democratic Party, long associated with old men in dark suits. The strong results suggested that Mr. Koizumi had made his party more attractive to the same younger and urban voters who had handed the opposition Democratic Party victories in cities in previous elections.
 ''We've destroyed the old L.D.P.,'' Mr. Koizumi said.

HEADLINE: All the President's Friends

BYLINE: By Paul Krugman. 
E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The lethally inept response to Hurricane Katrina revealed to everyone that the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which earned universal praise during the Clinton years, is a shell of its former self. The hapless Michael Brown -- who is no longer overseeing relief efforts but still heads the agency -- has become a symbol of cronyism.
 But what we really should be asking is whether FEMA's decline and fall is unique, or part of a larger pattern. What other government functions have been crippled by politicization, cronyism and/or the departure of experienced professionals? How many FEMA's are there? 
Unfortunately, it's easy to find other agencies suffering from some version of the FEMA syndrome.
 The first example won't surprise you: the Environmental Protection Agency, which has a key role to play in Hurricane Katrina's aftermath, but which has seen a major exodus of experienced officials over the past few years. In particular, senior officials have left in protest over what they say is the Bush administration's unwillingness to enforce environmental law.
 Yesterday The Independent, the British newspaper, published an interview about the environmental aftermath of Katrina with Hugh Kaufman, a senior policy analyst in the agency's Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response, whom one suspects is planning to join the exodus. ''The budget has been cut,'' he said, ''and inept political hacks have been put in key positions.'' That sounds familiar, and given what we've learned over the last two weeks there's no reason to doubt that characterization -- or to disregard his warning of an environmental cover-up in progress.
 What about the Food and Drug Administration? Serious questions have been raised about the agency's coziness with drug companies, and the agency's top official in charge of women's health issues resigned over the delay in approving Plan B, the morning-after pill, accusing the agency's head of overruling the professional staff on political grounds.
 Then there's the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, whose Republican chairman hired a consultant to identify liberal bias in its programs. The consultant apparently considered any criticism of the administration a sign of liberalism, even if it came from conservatives.
 You could say that these are all cases in which the Bush administration hasn't worried about degrading the quality of a government agency because it doesn't really believe in the agency's mission. But you can't say that about my other two examples. 
 Even a conservative government needs an effective Treasury Department. Yet Treasury, which had high prestige and morale during the Clinton years, has fallen from grace.
 The public symbol of that fall is the fact that John Snow, who was obviously picked for his loyalty rather than his qualifications, is still Treasury secretary. Less obvious to the public is the hollowing out of the department's expertise. Many experienced staff members have left since 2000, and a number of key positions are either empty or filled only on an acting basis. ''There is no policy,'' an economist who was leaving the department after 22 years told The Washington Post, back in 2002. ''If there are no pipes, why do you need a plumber?'' So the best and brightest have been leaving.
 And finally, what about the department of Homeland Security itself? FEMA was neglected, some people say, because it was folded into a large agency that was focused on terrorist threats, not natural disasters. But what, exactly, is the department doing to protect us from terrorists? 
 In 2004 Reuters reported a ''steady exodus'' of counterterrorism officials, who believed that the war in Iraq had taken precedence over the real terrorist threat. Why, then, should we believe that Homeland Security is being well run?
 Let's not forget that the administration's first choice to head the department was Bernard Kerik, a crony of Rudy Giuliani. And Mr. Kerik's nomination would have gone through if enterprising reporters hadn't turned up problems in his background that the F.B.I. somehow missed, just as it somehow didn't turn up the little problems in Michael Brown's resume. How many lesser Keriks made it into other positions?
 The point is that Katrina should serve as a wakeup call, not just about FEMA, but about the executive branch as a whole. Everything I know suggests that it's in a sorry state -- that an administration which doesn't treat governing seriously has created two, three, many FEMA's.

HEADLINE: Back to '68: Radicals, Chemicals and Patty Hearst

BYLINE: By JANET MASLIN

 BODY:

Backward-Facing Man
By Don Silver
309 pages. Ecco. $24.95.
 When lawyers write fiction they tend to be methodical about constructing plots. When doctors moonlight as novelists they often emphasize the scientific minutiae. Executives turned authors are liable to show the assurance that comes from addressing captive audiences. All of these tactics find their way into Don Silver's first novel, ''Backward-Facing Man.''
Mr. Silver, who formerly ran a Philadelphia manufacturing company, brings an abundance of miscellaneous expertise to his first book. One running motif concerns the use of dangerous chemicals, hardly the stuff of much debut fiction. But Mr. Silver is conversant not only with the toxic pollutants used in metal manufacturing but also with the bomb-building tactics of student revolutionaries circa 1968. He incorporates this knowledge into a present-day re-examination of the radical past.
 ''Facing backwards on a moving train is the story of my life,'' says the main character in a book eager to explain its metaphors. His name is Chuck Puckman (this counts in his favor), and he is saying this -- while facing backwards on a moving train -- to a nubile young woman who was named Stardust for a Joni Mitchell lyric. Furthermore, Chuck thinks that she may be his daughter by Lorraine Nadia, who was a dazzling free spirit in Cambridge, Mass., when Chuck was an M.I.T. student. And he thinks Stardust needs to be told about what those days were like.
 Thus Mr. Silver generates reason to replay the past and contrast it with Chuck's present-day, deflated situation. But he has the nervous novice's habit of piling on extra framing devices, creating clutter. So ''Backward-Facing Man'' is bookended by italic narrative passages from a woman who has written the memoir for her old friend from summer camp. 
 The old friend turns out to be none other than Patty Hearst, whose role as a zeitgeist queen grows ever more intense with the passage of time. In her Tania incarnation, she is also at the center of Christopher Sorrentino's recent ''Trance,'' a chillier but more audacious return to the Symbionese Liberation Army's 15 minutes of resonant fame. 
 In ''Backward-Facing Man,'' Patty delivers the Hearst family history in the form of a fairy tale. But she is really just a catalyst for Mr. Silver, a way for him to lead this story into the world of radicals gone underground. ''Backward-Facing Man'' is actually centered on a romantic triangle involving Lorraine, Chuck and a charismatic rebel named Frederick Keane, aka the Volcano Bomber.
 As it flips from the period around the millennium (''one of the few times you'd find right-wing survivalists and New Age crystal gazers side by side, joking in the aisles of Wal-Mart'') to 1968 and back again, the book wistfully contemplates the legacy of Frederick, Lorraine and Chuck's youthful determination. 
 What is most interesting is Mr. Silver's unwillingness to resolve things neatly. He knows that it would be dishonest to provide a tidy aftermath to the loose, druggy, rhetoric-filled atmosphere in which Stardust was created. So the reader moves with Chuck Puckman from a kind of hero worship of Lorraine and Frederick, the radical-chic power couple, into the junk-strewn, unappetizing maw of his family's security business. Both Frederick's bombs and the Puckmans' manufacturing plant wind up killing innocent people.
 The part of the book that rings most true, perhaps as a result of the author's business experience, is its description of the Puckman empire in South Philadelphia. The patriarch is now debilitated by a stroke, but he once built a little office ''on weekends out of mismatched wood paneling nailed to angle iron stolen from construction sites.'' Puckman senior has also entrusted part of the business to Chuck's creepy brother, Artie, who has been in and out of mental institutions. Now Artie is responsible for tricks like paying workers slightly less than they're supposed to earn and setting clocks in the shop a few minutes backward to further cheat employees. 
 In another nervous-novice gesture, Mr. Silver expends far too much energy on a subplot that sends Artie and the book to Belize. Chuck, however drifting and ghostly (''he looked like someone who had only partially materialized before the transporter malfunctioned''), remains by far the more interesting brother. Still, ''Backward-Facing Man'' is so overloaded with possibilities that it holds interest by making the reader wonder how all this can possibly coalesce. 
 Mr. Silver's unusual perspective and wide range of material are enough to make this a memorably offbeat debut. So is the palpable struggle that he captures on the page. Far from being wispily nostalgic, ''Backward-Facing Man'' is still fighting to make sense of its characters' late-60's political conviction and wonder what became of it. ''Drifters looked for jobs,'' he writes, about 1968 as a turning point. ''Renters bought houses, taking out 30-year mortgages. Slackers, those who'd been intentionally unemployed -- living off the land, turning on, making music, and loving each other freely -- quietly started careers or enrolled in graduate schools.'' As the book puts it, he wonders what turned flower children into gardeners. 
 Ultimately, as Stardust will come to understand, the lives of the three Cambridge friends did contain trace elements of their freer days. One got lucky. One did not. And one is left in the particular post-60's limbo that Mr. Silver poignantly summons. There are ''no big revelations, no payoff, no catharsis, no intimating of meaning or symmetry that one hopes to have at the end.''

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: Albany: Hevesi Warns Local Governments 

BYLINE: AP; Compiled by John Sullivan

 BODY:
Costs rising at twice the rate of inflation, slow growth in revenue, and forced reliance on debt mean tough times are likely ahead for taxpayers, according to an analysis by the office of the state comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, left. 
The study said local governments were more often depending on sales tax increases to raise revenues, and many were borrowing more. The analysis showed that local government debt increased 46 percent to $29.7 billion between 1998 and 2003.

HEADLINE: New Orleans News Media Soldier On, Ad-Free

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE; Bill Carter and Stuart Elliott contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Newspapers and television stations, as many people know, have been losing readers and viewers for years. But in New Orleans over the last two weeks, when news was precious, the local media's customer base -- and its advertisers -- literally vanished, exiled from home in a vast diaspora beyond the reach of telemarketers and ad salesmen.
 New Orleans media outlets, including The Times-Picayune and seven television stations making up the nation's 43rd-largest media market, have been left to contemplate a surreal future of unknown duration in a city devoid of functioning businesses, with no goods to advertise and almost no people to buy them. As a plaintive Times-Picayune headline put it Friday, ''Few Souls Remain in Shell of a City.''
 And yet the owners of The Times-Picayune, which had a circulation around 270,000 before Hurricane Katrina struck, and the seven television stations, which served about 670,000 households, were unflinching in their commitment to the deluged city -- making plain the difference between the manufacturers of widgets and the gatherers of news. 
 ''We're in this for the long haul,'' said Terry Mackin, executive vice president of Hearst-Argyle Television, owner of WDSU-TV, the NBC-affiliated station in New Orleans.
 Jeff Reiter, a spokesman for the Tribune Company, which owns WGNO-TV, the ABC-affiliated station, said, ''We are definitely committed to remaining in this market.'' 
 And Donald E. Newhouse, president of Advance Publications, which owns the daily newspaper, said: ''To use the words of our publisher, Ashton Phelps Jr., The Times-Picayune will continue to publish. Period. And we will continue to own The Times-Picayune. Period.'' 
 For the media outlets of New Orleans, the short-term issue has been to find a way to publish and distribute, to get on the air and stay on the air, while simultaneously covering and being caught up in what may be the biggest natural disaster in the nation's history.
 The extent of the physical damage to their plants and stations is unclear. Most have been dislocated and their staff members are working out of temporary newsrooms and studios around the region, barred by flood damage and a lack of electricity from getting back to their desks.
 The chaos of the short term has obscured the abyss of the long term, which is only beginning to emerge. As the news media outlets continue to produce, who will be reading them? Who will be watching them? And who will be paying for the substantial additional costs of gathering news during the crisis, which, for television stations, include expenses like renting helicopters? 
 The Times-Picayune took in an average of $9.2 million a month in ad revenue over the last six months, according to TNS Media Intelligence, part of Taylor Nelson Sofres, which tracks advertising spending. It has obviously lost some revenue, but it is hard at this point to say how much. Insurance companies, banks and area employers have been advertising in increasing numbers. But the newspaper has been able to print only two sections of eight pages each a day, although Jim Amoss, the editor, said he hoped to go to 20 pages. 
 Before the hurricane, the paper ran an average of 80 pages a day. 
 The television stations, which collectively took in an average of $7.5 million a month over the last six months, have probably lost a combined $3.7 million in the last two weeks.
 The question is how long these outlets, which earn the vast majority of their revenue from advertising, can go without that revenue. New Orleans is looking at months if not years of recovery. 
 ''They have to think of themselves in the short term as operating as public interest entities rather than as commercial entities,'' said Jon Swallen, director of research at TNS.
 ''But it still costs money to print your paper or broadcast your television programs, and where is that money going to come from? It's up to the corporate owners to decide how to proceed for how long and at what cost.''
 Such decisions hinge largely on when the city may become commercially viable again.
 ''That's a total unknown,'' said David Barrett, the president of Hearst-Argyle. ''Anyone who would suggest they knew the answer to that would be crazy. No one can even hazard a guess.''
 But Mr. Barrett did hazard a guess as to how long the television stations might operate before advertisers started to return.
 ''I expect we'll go four weeks or longer with no revenue at the station,'' he said. ''But we still have to meet the role of local broadcasters. We've been doing great local journalism, and we'll continue to. That's what a big broadcast company can do.''
 The closest analogy for how advertisers can approach the New Orleans market may be World War II, when there was virtually no production of consumer goods like cars and appliances as factories were retooled for military purposes. Many marketers continued to advertise, running patriotic pitches to stimulate sales of war bonds or offering uplifting vistas of a rosy postwar life.
 One of the most famous ad campaigns emerged from the 1940's when the Ford Motor Company adopted the forward-looking slogan, ''There's a Ford in your future.'' The only cars in the ads were drawings, inside an illustration of a crystal ball, implicitly giving people hope that peace and prosperity lay ahead.
 Sue Johenning, executive vice president and director for local broadcasting at the Initiative media agency in Los Angeles, said surveys the agency conducted after Sept. 11, 2001, showed that at some point consumers want ''a return to normalcy, and they see advertising as part of returning to normalcy.'' She said the surveys also showed ''advertisers that provided information and service were looked to favorably.'' 
 But New Orleans is too absorbed in the here and now to begin to think about normalcy.
 ''It's cavalier to do anything in the region unless it's about helping people,'' said Richard Kirshenbaum, co-chairman of a division of the MDC Corporation, Kirshenbaum Bond & Partners in New York, which operates agencies handling tasks including advertising, media buying and public relations.
 ''There's a level of appropriateness people ought to follow when the disaster is still in place,'' he said, likening the situation to the aftermath of 9/11 in the New York region when consumers felt that what they were going through was ''too devastating'' for anything overtly commercial.
 Mary Gerzema, executive vice president and communications planning director at Universal McCann in New York, said advertisers needed to avoid anything that seemed ''opportunistic or callous,'' but that did not mean all advertising should cease. ''The key is having something to say that people appreciate hearing and find useful,'' she said.
 For instance, for the Lowe's home-improvement chain, she said, the agency bought commercial time on radio stations or replaced already scheduled spots with new ones discussing how its stores had frozen prices, ordered extra shipments of needed merchandise and made donations to the Red Cross.
 Ads in The Times-Picayune have been of a plain, public service nature, with no pictures. The Whitney Bank was one of the first to start advertising again, and its ads have evolved in a span of just a few days. The first ads were titled ''Times Like These Call for a Bank Like the Whitney.'' Its ad in yesterday's paper announced a broad-based hurricane assistance loan for storm victims. 
 The paper is also seeing a new type of ad appealing to displaced persons.Kleinpeter Farms Dairy of Baton Rouge, La., for example, took out space in the paper to say, ''We welcome you, our new neighbors from New Orleans, and if you haven't already done so, we invite you to try our milk.'' 
 While advertisers are taking things a day at a time, media owners appear to be basing their determination to stay in New Orleans largely on the pending arrival of billions of dollars in reconstruction aid. 
 Executives from both Hearst and the Belo Corporation, which owns the CBS affiliate WWL-TV, said they expected the New Orleans market to rebound because reconstruction companies would want to advertise their services on local television. .
 ''People are going to need rebuilding,'' said Rick Keilty, senior vice president of Belo, ''and if you are in a business that provides that rebuilding, you are going to want to tell people you can provide those services.'' Mr. Mackin of Hearst-Argyle went so far as to predict an economic boom for stations in New Orleans. ''I think we'll see a short-term economic hit and then a long-term boom,'' he said, citing the billions in government dollars designated for the city.
 He said conventional local advertisers, like auto dealers and fast-food restaurants, would be in a position to reap the benefits of federal and charitable dollars -- at least that was the experience in places like Orlando and West Palm Beach, Fla., last year in the wake of hurricane damage.
 But the short term, all the executives conceded, is a total loss.
 ''I think it's a fair statement to say the advertising base has been wrecked,'' Mr. Keilty said. ''We're in the process of strategizing how we'll deal with that now.''
 WWL-TV, the market leader, is the only station that never left the air in New Orleans throughout the crisis, running continuous commercial-free news coverage of the storm and its aftermath. WWL is one of the nation's dominant local stations and is CBS's strongest affiliate in terms of market share for its local news programs, though it is impossible to say how many people are watching it now because without commercials, the stations are not being rated.
 But many of WWL's viewers have been relocated well outside the range of the station's broadcast signal, or the local cable systems that routinely carry it. In those cases, New Orleans residents have turned to the Internet for information.
 Mr. Keilty said some of WWL's advertisers had already been accommodated with space on the station's Web site, which has been streaming coverage of news developments. He said that one day last week, the site had more than 10.5 million page views. ''We're going to be looking more and more to the Web site for advertising revenue,'' he said.
 Similarly, The Times-Picayune established a milestone of sorts by producing its newspaper in a Web version only for three days after the flooding began. On Friday, Sept. 2, it resumed publishing a print version as well, with 50,000 papers at first, then 60,000.
 But with its regular readers scattered and with intense worldwide interest in New Orleans, the paper's Web site (nola.com) is poised to become increasingly dominant. It offers not just news but also a missing-persons database and details about neighborhoods from local residents. It is experiencing a heady increase in traffic.
 Peter Weinberger, president of Advance Internet, said the paper was getting 26 million page views a day -- just about the same number it had been getting a month in the period before the hurricane.
 And the number of advertisers, who receive prominent display on the Web, continues to climb. 
 Mr. Amoss, the editor, said yesterday that the news-to-advertising ratio was now a ''very healthy'' 50-50 with several full-page ads, many of them in color.

HEADLINE: Norway's Center-Right Premier Faces Coalition of Left at Polls Today 

BYLINE: By WALTER GIBBS

DATELINE: OSLO, Sept. 11 

 BODY:
As much of Europe struggles against economic stagnation and unemployment, Norway is flush with oil, cash and good jobs. 
 The stock market has tripled since early 2003, and interest rates have hit record lows.
 But with a national election on Monday, Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik is straining against a unified left in Norway's nine-party field.
 The central issue -- as usual in Scandinavia -- is social welfare spending. In four years Mr. Bondevik's center-right government has modestly increased such spending while restructuring the military, rebuffing asylum seekers judged to have no legitimate claim and cutting nearly everyone's tax bill. Many Norwegians now say, though, that they want to focus more aggressively on expanding what is already one of the world's most extensive social service networks. 
 ''We should use our money on welfare and schools and care for the elderly instead of tax relief,'' Jens Stoltenberg, a former Labor Party prime minister campaigning to win his old job back, said recently in a debate on state television. He has vowed to undo the tax cuts ''for the rich'' that were enacted last year and to put social and job-security issues at the fore.
 For several months, opinion polls have suggested that left-leaning parties would win a clear majority of Norway's 169 parliamentary seats. However, a poll for TV2, a commercial broadcast station, on Friday found a slight lead for Mr. Bondevik, 58, and his non-Socialist bloc.
 Mr. Stoltenberg, 46, the opposition leader since 2001, has moved away from the business-friendly centrism that Labor espoused in the 1980's and 1990's. He renewed his embrace of the trade union confederation, which wants to shorten workdays to six hours, and joined forces with the once fringe Socialist Left Party, which seeks expanded state control and financing of day care, education and health services. In its official platform, the Socialist Left calls the United States ''the greatest threat to peace in the world.''
 Conservative Party leader Erna Solberg has called the newly consolidated left a ''red danger'' that could sap Norwegian economic competitiveness and isolate the country internationally. In the televised debate, Mr. Bondevik said a Stoltenberg-led government would also cloud the future of Norway's offshore petroleum industry. While Mr. Stoltenberg supports drilling in the Barents Sea, his partners in the Socialist Left are fiercely opposed on environmental grounds.
 In every year of his term, Mr. Bondevik noted, the United Nations Development Program has ranked Norway as the world's best country in which to live. ''These have been four good years for Norway,'' Mr. Bondevik said, apparently surprised that some of his countrymen wished to change course.
 But the Labor Party has dominated politics here since World War II and remains the default choice for many Norwegians. Though support waned after three-time Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland left politics in 1996, the party has partly regrouped on the strength of Mr. Stoltenberg's bridge-building.
 ''This is the first time in history the Norwegian Labor Party has been willing to enter into a coalition with anybody,'' said Frank Aarebrot, a professor of comparative politics at the University of Bergen. ''It has always ruled alone.''
 If the newly consolidated left wins on Monday, analysts said, Kristin Halvorsen, the Socialist Left leader, will probably demand a major cabinet presence for her party, including the post of finance minister or foreign minister. 
 That may explain her uncharacteristically diplomatic tone in remarks last week to the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs. She said that if given power her party would no longer insist -- as it has for decades -- that Norway withdraw from NATO. Nor, she said, would it go out of its way to pursue anti-American policies. But she added, ''We must move from being a poodle of the U.S.A. to a partner of the U.S.A.''
 Mr. Stoltenberg opposed the United States-led invasion of Iraq and has said he would recall the few Norwegian military officers now serving there. Ms. Halvorsen would also like to recall several dozen Norwegian special forces troops under United States command in Afghanistan -- a step Mr. Stoltenberg opposes.
 Mr. Bondevik's coalition of Christian Democrats, conservatives and liberals now controls only 38 percent of Parliament. Mr. Stoltenberg's proposed majority government would include Labor and the Socialist Left as well as the small Center Party, which is Norway's most vigorous defender of farm subsidies and trade protectionism.
 A wild card in the election is the populist Progress Party. Stigmatized by detractors as fiscally reckless and occasionally xenophobic, it has propped up Mr. Bondevik from the right without ever being invited into government. Now, however, the Progress leader, Carl I. Hagen, says he has had enough of being snubbed and will no longer support Mr. Bondevik. In the current political flux, that could bring Labor to power even if the electorate leaned right.

HEADLINE: Ford Labor Deal in Canada Includes Job Cuts

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 11 

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company is close to reaching agreement with its Canadian union over a new labor contract that will include significant job cuts, a top labor leader said Sunday night. 
 ''We're not going to have a rich agreement, but we're going to have a responsible agreement,'' said Buzz Hargrove, president of the Canadian Auto Workers union, in a teleconference from Toronto.
Ford presented the union with a proposal on wages, pensions, health care and other economic issues on Sunday night, and Mr. Hargrove said he believed that it would ''satisfy the concerns of our members and their families.'' He was optimistic that an agreement could be reached Monday. It would then need to be ratified by Ford's Canadian workers. 
 Any deal reached with Ford would set a pattern for agreements negotiated with General Motors and the Chrysler division of DaimlerChrysler this month. 
 The negotiations come in what has been a most difficult year for G.M. and Ford. Customers have continued to abandon the companies for rivals like Toyota, and rising gas prices have sapped demand for the large sport utility vehicles that were a boon to the companies' profits in past years. Even Chrysler, which has shown signs of recovery, is pressing hard for labor concessions in a harshly competitive climate.
 Ford has 12,460 unionized employees in Ontario working at two assembly plants and five other facilities. But by the time the next three-year contract expires in 2008, there will be fewer workers. Mr. Hargrove declined to say how many workers Ford wanted to cut, saying only that there would be ''significant employment losses over the life of this agreement. 
 ''We will come out of '08 with significantly less people working at Ford Motor Company in Canada,'' he said.
 William Clay Ford Jr., Ford's chairman and chief executive, has said he will announce a restructuring plan later this year to address his company's steepening domestic losses. Mr. Hargrove said he was working to ensure that job cuts would not be made through layoffs but by using early retirement packages and other enticements. 
 John Arnone, a spokesman for Ford of Canada, said, ''we've said all along that this will be a tough, but not impossible, challenge.''
 ''The negotiations are progressing well,'' he added. ''We have narrowed down the issues and we're focused on reaching a sustainable agreement.'' 
 Last week, Mr. Hargrove selected Ford to lead his union's negotiations with the three Detroit-based automakers. The Canadian and American auto unions traditionally focus on a single company where they think they can win the best deal. That first deal then sets a pattern for deals with the other two companies. 
 In comments late last week, Mr. Hargrove said that given the difficult economic times in Detroit, he saw Ford as the least-bad option among the three companies because it had a more accommodating history with the union than its rivals.

 BODY:
ECONOMIC AFTERMATH -- Early evidence of how much stress Katrina has put on the national economy will be piling up this week. Did higher gasoline prices make shoppers more thrifty? Chain-store sales figures compiled by the International Council of Shopping Centers, due out tomorrow, and government retail sales figures, coming out on Wednesday, should provide clues. Did $70 oil crimp manufacturing? Manufacturing surveys being released Friday by the New York and Philadelphia Federal Reserve Banks may have some answers to that question. We will learn more about inflation prospects from tomorrow's report on producer prices and Friday's data on consumer prices. Jobless claims out Thursday may actually show a decline (people fleeing the hurricane had no way to fill out forms) before surging in the weeks ahead. 
 ABOUT THAT SURPLUS -- President Bush and President Hu Jintao of China will have plenty to talk about at their meeting in New York tomorrow, including China's galloping trade surplus with the United States and its equally surging appetite for oil. Mr. Hu, above, is widely believed to be eager to ease economic tensions on those and other issues, ranging from China's fixed-rate currency to its violations of intellectual-property rights. The Chinese leader had originally planned to travel to Washington last week for lunch with President Bush in the White House, but Hurricane Katrina forced a postponement.
BEEN DOWN THIS ROAD BEFORE -- The United States and Europe have been feuding for decades over the subsidies each side accuses the other of showering on its farmers, and they'll be at it again this week. The United States trade representative, Rob Portman; the European trade commissioner, Peter Mandelson; and Europe's agriculture commissioner, Mariann Fischer Boel, will begin two days of talks in Washington tomorrow aimed at achieving some sort of accord on reducing their price supports and thus pave the way for World Trade Organization negotiations later this year for a new global trade agreement. ''We can no longer procrastinate,'' Mr. Portman said last week. A spokesman for Mr. Mandelson said that Europe wanted to make Washington aware of reforms already introduced.
 ALSO THIS WEEK -- The second trial of Merck's Vioxx painkiller drug is scheduled to open in Atlantic City today. Northwest has warned striking workers that it is prepared to give permanent jobs to substitutes starting tomorrow.

Hundreds of ordinary Palestinians followed. A10

Iraqi Rebels Flee Stronghold
Even though many insurgents in the rebel stronghold of Tal Afar may have escaped before the most recent American and Iraqi assault began, Iraq's Defense Minister, Sadoun Dulaimi, called the operation a success and forcefully reminded insurgents that they would find no safe haven in Iraq. A6

Ford Close on Canadian Pact
The Ford Motor Company is close to reaching agreement with its Canadian union over a new labor contract that will include significant job cuts, a top labor leader said. The president of the Canadian Auto Workers union declined to say how many workers Ford wanted to cut, saying only that there would be ''significant employment losses'' by 2008. A6

Iran Again Rejects Demands

President Bush Returns To New Orleans
President Bush arrived in New Orleans for his third visit as the city continued its determined struggle to recover from Hurricane Katrina's shattering arrival two weeks ago. The airport announced plans to resume some commercial flights, a large levee breach has been closed, and floodwaters have slowly receded, speeding recovery but also exposing the breadth of the devastation.

HEADLINE: U.S. Seeks Cooperation With China 

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Sept. 11 

 BODY:
The commander of United States military forces in the Pacific and most of the Indian Ocean sounded a conciliatory note toward China on Sunday. He called for closer cooperation between the United States and Chinese militaries and an agreement about how to coordinate responses to natural disasters like the tsunami last Dec. 26.
 While the United States and China have extensive political and economic contacts, ''the military side of this thing has been lacking, and I think it's time to change that,'' said the American commander, Adm. William J. Fallon, at a news conference here. He toured China during the past week, meeting with senior military officers in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Hong Kong. 
 The admiral's remarks were especially noteworthy because he spoke as President Bush and President Hu Jintao of China prepared to meet Tuesday at the United Nations. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld will visit Beijing next month.
 Jin Canrong, the associate dean of the School of International Studies at People's University in Beijing, said Admiral Fallon's stance was likely to be welcomed by China. ''I think the Chinese side is eager to have normal military-to-military ties with the American Army,'' he said.
 Contacts between the United States and Chinese militaries abruptly stopped after a midair collision between a Chinese jet and an American Navy reconnaissance aircraft near Hainan island on April 1, 2001. But those contacts have gradually started to resume.
 United States officials were increasingly critical of China this year regarding issues including the weakness of China's currency, the yuan, and the scale of Chinese military spending. Mr. Rumsfeld made headlines in June when he warned in a speech in Singapore that rising Chinese military spending posed a threat to regional stability in Asia. Admiral Fallon avoided broad statements on Sunday, sticking to strictly military issues, and was loath to criticize China on those. ''The business of military expenditures is certainly something that is the business of the country involved,'' he said. He also said that China's military needed to modernize in many areas. 
 Admiral Fallon said that he had attended Mr. Rumsfeld's speech in Singapore and believed that news coverage of it over-emphasized the criticism of China. But Admiral Fallon said near the end of his remarks that he shared Mr. Rumsfeld's views over all and questioned China's need for a large military. ''We do not see an enemy to China; we do not see a threat to China,'' he said.
 Admiral Fallon also said he wanted the United States and Chinese militaries to discuss avian influenza. The United States military has been concerned about the possible effect on soldiers if avian influenza were to spread among people.
 Pro-Beijing news organizations were invited to the news conference here, just as Chinese news media had been invited to a news conference Admiral Fallon held in Beijing last Wednesday. Admiral Fallon went out of his way on each occasion to present the United States as no threat to China.

China Frees U.S. Man in Spying Case
By The New York Times
 BEIJING, Sept. 11 -- China has released an American businessman held for more than three months on charges of spying for Taiwan. The businessman, Xie Chunren, a Chinese-born health supplements supplier, said Sunday that he was released Sept. 4 and returned four days later to his home in Somerset, N.J. 
 State security investigators in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province in western China, told Mr. Xie that he had been cleared of the charges. ''They said I can go back to China at any time,'' he said, ''but I don't think I'm going to do any business in China for months or years.''
 Mr. Xie, 56, was detained May 31 on arrival in Chengdu, where many of his relatives live. He said investigators had asked him many ''very specific questions'' including some about David Wei Dong, also called Dong Wei, an American arrested in China in 2003 on suspicion of spying. Earlier, Xie Yuanyang, Mr. Xie's son said his father might have been detained because of past contacts with Mr. Dong, who was still being held.

HEADLINE: Iran Warns the West Not to Use the U.N. to Penalize It

BYLINE: By NAZILA FATHI; Steven R. Weisman contributed reporting from Washington for this article.

DATELINE: TEHRAN, Sept. 11 

 BODY:
Iran's foreign minister warned Sunday of serious consequences if its repeated refusal to suspend sensitive nuclear activities prompted Western nations to submit the case to the United Nations Security Council to consider possible penalties. 
 The comments came as Iran's new president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, prepared to travel to New York to address the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday.
''There is no question of returning to a new suspension at Isfahan,'' Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki said Sunday, referring to the city where a plant has resumed uranium conversion, the first step in the nuclear-fuel production process.
 ''There is no legal basis to send the dossier to the Security Council,'' Mr. Mottaki said in his first news conference as foreign minister. ''This would be a political move. We do not see a serious sign that this will happen.'' 
 He added, ''It is natural that such an event will have consequences, but right now I do not want to go into what the repercussions would be.'' 
 Iran defied an agreement with Germany, France and Britain last month and resumed the uranium conversion. Iran began talks with the three countries, which also represent Europe, two years ago. The Europeans have pressed Iran for a permanent end to its nuclear activities, which Europe and the United States suspect are intended to make nuclear arms. Iran says its program is for peaceful energy purposes.
 Iran also refused to comply with a demand last month from the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations nuclear monitoring agency, to halt the program and said making nuclear fuel for civilian purposes was its right under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. 
 The three European countries and the United States plan to urge the atomic energy agency's board, at its next meeting, on Sept. 19, to forward the case to the Security Council.
 Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Friday that the United States and its European partners continued to demand that Iran suspend its nuclear activities or face the prospect of having the matter referred to the Security Council. Iran's statement on Sunday sets the stage for a possible confrontation at the United Nations.
 Iran has adopted a tougher stance on its nuclear program under Mr. Ahmadinejad, the conservative president who took office last month.
 Political analysts in Tehran say Iran's position is stronger than it was when the talks with Europe began.
 Iranian officials say that they have improved their nuclear technology since then and that two years of intrusive inspections by the nuclear agency have not provided opponents of Iran's nuclear program with a ''smoking gun.'' 
 Some Western diplomats concede that the atomic energy agency has not reported any ''smoking gun'' evidence of an Iranian nuclear weapons program, but they cite the agency's conclusion that Iran has failed to disclose everything about its nuclear activities as evidence of its bad faith, and they call that a basis for taking the case to the Security Council.
 Iranian officials say they doubt that Europe and the United States will be able to get enough support from among the 35 member states of the nuclear agency's board of governors to send the case to the Security Council. Iran is a major oil producer, and sanctions against it could cause oil prices to rise even higher.
 ''Iran is not bluffing over its nuclear program,'' said Nasser Hadian, a political analyst in Tehran. ''They hope they can resolve the matter at the I.A.E.A. but they are prepared if their case is sent to the Security Council.'' 
 He added, ''I hope the opportunity of resolving the matter through negotiations would not turn into a threat, because the consequences would be unknown for everybody.''
 Iran has threatened to withdraw from the nonproliferation treaty and bar inspectors from its nuclear sites if its case is sent to the Security Council. 
 ''Referring the case to the Security Council would be a lose-lose game, and we would prefer that this game does not happen,'' Mr. Mottaki, the foreign minister, said Sunday. ''We see a win-win situation that is where the E.U. and international community have confidence and the Islamic Republic of Iran reaches its legitimate right.''
 President Ahmadinejad has said that Iran favors continuing its negotiations with Europe. He is expected to announce his new proposal on Wednesday, when he addresses the General Assembly. 
 The chief of Iran's nuclear negotiating team, Ali Larijani, proposed widening negotiations beyond the three European countries to include members of the nonaligned bloc on the board, like South Africa and Malaysia. Those countries have been more sympathetic to the Iranian position and have resisted the effort to refer Iran's case to the Security Council. Western diplomats have indicated that they would reject such a proposal.

HEADLINE: The Prices! Rising Fast And Still Finding Buyers 

BYLINE: By Guy Trebay

 BODY:
There are probably more scientific ways to measure the bulge at the upper end of the economy, but the season's hot Prada coat is one way to tell how much disposable income is floating around. The coat is black wool and has jet beading at the lapel and collar. It is fitted, severe, and as chic as widow's weeds. The person who puts one on immediately assumes the sleek and impertinent air of an urban crow. That the price of the coat is around $5,500 has apparently done little to deter sales. Since the first fall shipments, even the Prada stores have had trouble keeping the coats in stock. 
 Price resistance is not typically the first thing on people's minds during Fashion Week. But even industry die-hards have been forced into a new, and slightly uneasy, relationship with what people outside the business might think of as reality. 
''I'm a real person and I'm, like, totally sticker-shocked,'' said Lauren Ezersky, the Style channel commentator, before the Duckie Brown men's wear show on Friday. An inveterate clotheshorse, she has recently had to cut back on her wardrobe outlay. 
 ''Prices have gotten insane,'' Ms. Ezersky said, the reasons having to do partly with the continued weakness of the dollar against the euro and partly, one assumes, with the proliferation of an expanded cast of what marketers term the super-affluent. ''You used to be able to buy a pair of Manolos for $500, and now every pair of shoes is 800 bucks,'' she said indignantly.
 For most Americans, the idea of buying a $500 pair of Manolo Blahnik shoes is so far outside the realm of the possible that it is not so much an aspiration as a delusion. 
 The argument is often made that Fashion Week sets the bar aesthetically and gives the knockoff specialists and discounters something to steal. 
 More people get their fashion information from supermarket tabloids like The National Enquirer than Vogue, after all, and those magazines routinely publish articles demonstrating how readers can look as stylishly indifferent to style as Drew Barrymore does, and for under $100. (Last week's Mirror Image feature in The Enquirer offered rhinestone-studded jeans from loehmanns.com for $7 and, from shoepavilion.com, boots for $18.99.) 
 Most stars, of course, are given their clothes. And, while Miuccia Prada once wisecracked about the efficiency with which the so-called High Street brands like Zara and Top Shop could ''interpret'' her designs, even Ms. Prada has had to reckon with an increasingly polarized marketplace. 
 Prada's way of doing this has been to introduce a new line of underwear, T-shirts and jeans. Anything but a bargain, they nevertheless reflect a truth rarely discussed in the industry: All consumers now have access to the same information. Relatively few earn enough to buy what they see.
 So when Simon Doonan, the creative director of Barneys New York, said on Friday that business was surprisingly strong, it was with the caveat, ''I'm shocked that there's no price resistance anymore.'' For this season's must-have jacket from Marc Jacobs, Mr. Doonan said, Barneys shoppers will blithely pay $4,000. 
 Despite his high profile and, presumably, income, Mr. Doonan retains a level-headedness to be expected from someone raised in working-class England in the 1950's. ''I personally have huge price resistance,'' he said. ''If something costs more than $1,000, I want it to be custom.'' 
 Among those whose business it is this week to put across high-end fashion, Mr. Doonan and his attitude would be something of an anomaly. ''I'm personally in a little bit of a strange economic bracket, so I don't really look at price tags,'' the lingerie entrepreneur Sarah Siegel-Magness said at the Esteban Cortazar show on Friday afternoon, as her 6-year-old daughter, Camryn, dressed in a Burberry sundress, squirmed in her lap. 
 Ms. Siegel-Magness is the daughter of Mo Siegel, the former Colorado hippie who made his fortune on Celestial Seasonings herbal teas. And she is married to Gary Magness, the son of the late cable television magnate Bob Magness, whose fortune was estimated by Forbes at $875 million in 2004. 
 ''My friends look at the prices of my clothes and my bags, and they're like, you've got to be kidding,'' said Ms. Siegel-Magness, who flies in from Boulder, Colo., to attend the twice yearly New York collections for the fun of it and because, as she said, ''If I only lived in my world, I would be out of touch.''
 It may no longer be possible, as Mr. Doonan suggested, to reconcile the disparity between people like Ms. Siegel-Magness and the images that have filled the press these past weeks of people who Barbara Bush characterized as ''underprivileged anyway.'' No one expects the fashion world to sort out a class quagmire that has confounded the canniest politicians. But there are worse places to look for clues about our economic future than the Bryant Park tents.

HEADLINE: Gulf Coast Isn't the Only Thing Left in Tatters; Bush's Status With Blacks Takes a Hit

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
From the political perspective of the White House, Hurricane Katrina destroyed more than an enormous swath of the Gulf Coast. The storm also appears to have damaged the carefully laid plans of Karl Rove, President Bush's political adviser, to make inroads among black voters and expand the reach of the Republican Party for decades to come.
 Many African-Americans across the country said they seethed as they watched the television pictures of the largely poor and black victims of Hurricane Katrina dying for food and water in the New Orleans Superdome and the convention center. A poll released last week by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center bore out that reaction as well as a deep racial divide: Two-thirds of African-Americans said the government's response to the crisis would have been faster if most of the victims had been white, while 77 percent of whites disagreed. 
The anger has invigorated the president's critics. Kanye West, the rap star, raged off-script at a televised benefit for storm victims that ''George Bush doesn't care about black people.'' Howard Dean, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said in Miami last week that Americans ''have to come to terms with the ugly truth that skin color, age and economics played a significant role in who survived and who did not.''
 At the White House, the public response has been to denounce the critics as unseemly and unfair. ''I think all of those remarks were disgusting, to be perfectly frank,'' Laura Bush said in an interview with the American Urban Radio Network, when asked about the comments of Mr. West and Mr. Dean. ''Of course President Bush cares about everyone in our country.''
 Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, the administration's most prominent African-American, weighed in, too. ''Nobody, especially the president, would have left people unattended on the basis of race,'' Ms. Rice said, en route to her native Alabama to attend a church service.
 But behind the scenes in the West Wing, there has been anxiety and scrambling -- after an initial misunderstanding, some of the president's advocates say, of the racial dimension to the crisis.
 One of Mr. Bush's prominent African-American supporters called the White House to say he was aghast at the images from the president's first trip to the region, on Sept. 2, when Mr. Bush stood next to Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi and Gov. Bob Riley of Alabama, both white Republicans, and praised them for a job well done. Mr. Bush did not go into the heart of New Orleans to meet with black victims.
 ''I said, 'Grab some black people who look like they might be preachers,''' said the supporter, who asked not to be named because he did not want to be identified as criticizing the White House.Three days later, on Mr. Bush's next trip to the region, the president appeared in Baton Rouge at the side of T.D. Jakes, the conservative African-American television evangelist and the founder of a 30,000-member megachurch in southwest Dallas. 
 Bishop Jakes, a multimillionaire and best-selling author, is to deliver the sermon this Friday at the Washington National Cathedral, his office said, where Mr. Bush will mark a national day of prayer for Hurricane Katrina's victims. The bishop's style of preaching is black Pentecostal -- he roars and rumbles in performances that got him on the cover of Time magazine as ''America's best preacher'' in 2001. More important to Mr. Rove, he has become a vital partner in the White House effort to court the black vote.
 Last week, the White House continued its political recovery effort among African-Americans through its network of conservative black preachers like Bishop Jakes. Many of them have received millions of dollars for their churches through Mr. Bush's initiative to support religious-based social services -- a factor, Republicans say, in Mr. Bush's small increase in support among black voters, from 9 percent in 2000 to 11 percent in 2004.
 On Tuesday in the Roosevelt Room, Mr. Bush met with black preachers and leaders of national charities, and sat next to Bishop Roy L.H. Winbush, a black religious leader from Louisiana. On Thursday, two senior White House officials, Claude Allen and James Towey, held a conference call with black religious leaders to ask what needed to be done. Mr. Towey is the director of the White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives, and Mr. Allen, who is African-American, is the president's domestic policy adviser.
 One Bush supporter, the Rev. Eugene F. Rivers III, the president of the National Ten Point Leadership Foundation, a coalition that represents primarily black churches, said last week that something positive might come out of the crisis. ''This is a moral and intellectual opportunity for the Bush administration to clearly articulate a policy agenda for the black poor,'' Mr. Rivers said in an interview.
 Ken Mehlman, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, who has made reaching out to black voters a priority, put it simply. ''We're going to work with them,'' Mr. Mehlman said. ''This disaster showed how important it is that we do these things.''

HEADLINE: Excitement Clings to Internet in China 

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: HANGZHOU, China, Sept. 10 

 BODY:
Even before China's annual ''Internet summit'' got under way here, Charles Zhang, the stylish founder of the Web portal Sohu.com, was holding court in the lobby of the Hyatt Hotel, standing before a crush of reporters and television cameras.
 Soon after, two other Chinese Internet superstars, William Ding, the 34-year-old chief executive of Netease.com, and Ma Huateng, also 34, the founder of Tencent.com, made their way toward the hotel's grand ballroom, pursued like a pair of rock stars.
Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba.com and the host of this one-day conference, said that the night before he had turned 40. His dinner guests that evening were Jerry Yang, the co-founder of Yahoo, and Bill Clinton, who was scheduled to address the Internet forum. 
 In a country where Internet use is exploding and another Bill -- Bill Gates -- is widely admired, about 600 people packed a Hyatt ballroom on a Saturday afternoon to listen to some of the nation's young Internet millionaires talk about the future.
 ''These are the Internet legends of China,'' said Ho Ben, 28, a participant at the conference and the general manager of a toy company that sources online goods through Alibaba.com, China's largest business-to-business Web site. ''I'm a great admirer of these guys, not only because they've made our lives different but because they've made our business much easier.''
 Mr. Ma -- the architect of China's biggest Internet deal this year, a partnership with Yahoo -- convened this annual gathering of some of China's largest Internet companies to discuss the state of the business.
 This year, it seems, China's small cadre of Internet moguls has many reasons to celebrate. America's largest Internet companies and venture capital firms are now flocking to invest here. 
 The biggest deal came early last month, when Yahoo agreed to invest $1 billion in the six-year-old Alibaba.com. As part of the deal, Yahoo even agreed to hand over its Yahoo China operations to Mr. Ma, who is considered one of China's Internet pioneers.
 Last month also brought the spectacular Nasdaq debut of Baidu.com, China's biggest search engine company. Its shares soared on their first day of trading in one of the most successful initial public stock offerings since the end of the Internet bubble in 2000 and 2001. 
 EBay has also made big moves, acquiring China's biggest online auction company, Eachnet.com, and promising to invest $100 million in China this year.
 Much of the excitement has been ignited by reports that there are now more than 100 million Internet users here, ranking China second only to the United States. 
 And with Internet use growing at a phenomenal pace, up from about two million users in 1998, venture capital firms are descending upon China, hoping to find the next Yahoo, Google or eBay.
 This year's summit, however, was partly overshadowed by reports last week that Yahoo had provided information that helped authorities in China sentence a Chinese journalist to 10 years in prison for leaking ''state secrets'' to a foreign Web site.
 Mr. Yang, Yahoo's co-founder, declined to discuss details of the case, in which the 37-year-old journalist sent anonymous e-mail messages to a Web site based in America, according to court documents. But Mr. Yang said that Yahoo had no alternative other than to comply with Chinese law.
 ''I don't like the outcomes of what happens with these things, but we have to comply with the law,'' he said during the conference.
 Concerns persist about whether the major Western Internet companies help Chinese authorities monitor and censor content on their Web sites, and even whether they help the authorities crack down on dissent or imprison political opponents.
 But the conference did little to shed light on that issue. Attendees were more interested in talking about new profit strategies and even some social issues, like whether Chinese youths were becoming addicted to online games.
 Several participants, including Mr. Ding, once listed as China's richest man, said they were cooperating with the government to combat online game addiction.
 In the spirit of a conference that had questioners often referring to the speakers as ''Internet heroes,'' one woman also had a more personal question for Mr. Ding: ''When are you going to get married?''
 While most of the big Internet players in China showed up for the summit, including Wang Yan, the head of Sina.com, one of the major portals, the absence of executives from eBay and Baidu was conspicuous but hardly surprising.
 EBay is facing stiff competition in China from Taobao.com, a subsidiary of Alibaba. Baidu, in which Google has a small stake, is considered a strong challenger to the new Alibaba-Yahoo partnership. And Microsoft is now battling Google in a Washington court, accusing one of its former Chinese executives of violating a noncompete clause by joining rival Google earlier this year.
 Still, Mr. Ma said all the major players had been invited to attend his summit in the spirit of ''peaceful'' discussion.
 The flamboyant Mr. Ma, who stands just over 5 feet, is one of China's oldest Internet moguls. He is also one of the richest. After his deal with Yahoo, privately held Alibaba.com is now valued at about $4.2 billion, making it China's most valuable Internet company. Mr. Ma, a former English teacher, is also skilled at attracting publicity for Alibaba, which is based in Hangzhou. 
 The event, held in the beautiful West Lake area, attracted widespread press coverage in China, besides scores of bankers, deal makers, movie producers and Internet bandwagon followers. During the intermission, cameramen and eager fans raced after speakers, several of whom chose to scamper into the bathroom for cover.
 But onstage, China's Internet entrepreneurs acknowledged that they were facing plenty of hurdles in making their companies profitable and successful.
 They said that competition was intense and that online payments systems were problematic. But they also said their companies had matured during the last few years, when fierce rivalries had evolved into heated accusations and even legal battles over intellectual property.
 ''Four years ago, we were naive. There was fierce fighting,'' said Mr. Ma of Alibaba. ''Now all of us are survivors. We are more calm-minded.''

HEADLINE: Necessary Measures

BYLINE: By Amir Attaran. 
Amir Attaran, a scientist and lawyer, is a professor at the University of Ottawa.

DATELINE: OTTAWA 

 BODY:
FIVE years ago, about 150 world leaders gathered at the United Nations in New York and tried to move the mountain of global poverty. They adopted eight Millennium Development Goals -- quantifiable measures of progress on problems like malaria, tuberculosis and child and maternal mortality. The achievement of those goals by 2015 would lift more than one billion people out of extreme poverty. 
 The trouble is that progress toward these benchmarks often cannot be measured. And if their achievement cannot be measured, the goals are not only a letdown for the world's poor, but also a time bomb for the credibility of the United Nations. As world leaders gather in New York again this week, the United Nations will have to grapple with the question of whether progress is on track to achieve the goals by the 2015 deadline. So far, this inability to measure progress has meant that the United Nations has either guessed or remained silent. 
Consider the hazard of dying in pregnancy or childbirth, a fate that befalls more than 500,000 women annually, according to the World Health Organization. The Millennium Development Goal on maternal mortality is to ''reduce by three-quarters, between 1990 and 2015, the maternal mortality ratio.'' Measuring that ratio requires an accurate count of both safe births and maternal fatalities.
 But according to the United Nations Millennium Project, only a ''handful of countries'' can really prove the maternal mortality ratio is improving; poor, rural countries where obstetricians are scarce, home births are common and the dead are mourned privately simply do not have the data. That is why in 2000, their most recent assessment, scientists from the United Nations warned that ''it would be inappropriate to compare the 2000 estimates with those for 1990,'' or to ''draw conclusions about trends.'' 
 Malaria is another example where United Nations goals hinge on something immeasurable. In 2000, the organization's scientists warned that ''it will not, in general, be possible to measure the overall incidence rate of malaria.'' Yet barely two months later, the United Nations placed bets on doing exactly that and persuaded the world's leaders to endorse a new Millennium Development Goal to start lowering the incidence of malaria by 2015. 
 Having ignored the advice of its own scientists and fashioned its goal unwisely, the United Nations today studiously avoids having an opinion on whether the malaria crisis -- the disease is the No. 1 killer of children in sub-Saharan Africa -- is getting better or worse. And yet, nobody who studies malaria doubts that it is getting worse.
 Probably the most useful discussion the United Nations could plan for this week's meeting would be one that asked world leaders to endorse new goals against which they could truly measure progress. This is feasible: there are alternative ways to track malaria's toll or to assess the safety of pregnancies. For instance, dozens of demographic surveillance sites could be set up in the poorest countries to document births, deaths, illnesses and social services. This has already been done in countries like Tanzania and Ghana. 
 How disappointing it is that the United Nations leadership went to great lengths to ensure that no such discussion could happen this week. Last September, Louise Frechette, the United Nations deputy secretary general, instructed the organization's scientists that she didn't want the summit meeting being ''distracted by arguments over the measurement of the Millennium Development Goals,'' and ordered that they refrain from proposing any refinements to the goals. This is lamentable political censorship. 
 By putting that discussion off limits, and pretending the Millennium Development Goals are meaningful as they now stand, the United Nations has lost five years on a short timeline and sabotaged its own vital mission to help the world's most unfortunate and needy people.

HEADLINE: Rush to Set Up U.S. Housing For Survivors

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON

DATELINE: SLIDELL, La., Sept. 12 

 BODY:
One team of men is bent over drills, driving mobile home anchors deep into the moist earth. Others are lifting cinder blocks that will be used to hold up the next set of identical beige homes that trucks, one after another, are bringing here.
 A building boom is under way in this city at the edge of Lake Pontchartrain, where one-third of the houses have been damaged or destroyed.
But this is just the start.
 The government is beginning what urban planners are calling one of the biggest bursts of federal housing development in United States history. Last year in Florida, the Federal Emergency Management Agency set a record by installing 15,000 homes in the aftermath of four hurricanes there. In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, they hope to open 30,000 homes every two weeks, reaching 300,000 within months. 
 Those numbers make Levittown -- the suburban community on Long Island where 17,447 houses were built after World War II -- look modest. Even the rebuilding of Chicago after the great fire of 1871 or San Francisco after the 1906 earthquake do not compare, said Ruth C. Steiner, an associate professor at the Department of Urban and Regional Planning at the University of Florida.
 ''This is a milestone of urban planning,'' Ms. Steiner said ''There is no precedent on this scale in this country. It is just phenomenal.''
 The numbers might drop if the demand does not meet expectations. But more than 140,000 people are now packed into emergency shelters, while hundreds of thousands of others fill hotels, homes of friends or relatives or are temporarily relocated across the United States. The building blitz is intended to bring as many people as possible back to Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama.
 ''It is like pushing a big rock down a hill,'' said Brad Gair, head of FEMA's hurricane housing task force, of the project. ''It takes a little time to get it moving, but once it gets moving, it moves very fast. And that is where we are getting right now.''
 The families moving into the first of these new trailers and mobile homes, the use of which are provided at no cost, seem almost startled to be inside a structure that is not flooded or stiflingly hot and overstuffed with people. 
 Elizabeth Burregi, 37; her husband Victor, 41; and their three young children arrived Sunday with trash bags filled with donated clothing and other goods. Their side of their home in Marrero, La., was ripped off during the storm. Just about the only thing they carried out with them was the three pet turtles that Christopher, 12, insisted not be left behind.
 But already, Sunday, within an hour of arriving, they were feeling at home. ''I got air-conditioning!'' Mrs. Burregi cried out, as she stood with her hands lifted up toward the vent that was pumping out cool air in her new trailer. ''This is better. This is much, much better.''
 Glenn Barkston, 40, of Kenner, La., said, ''God has looked down on us like you would never believe.'' He was overjoyed, even though he does not have sheets, pots or pans, or even soap for the new trailer he is now sharing with his mother in Patterson, La. ''We are very fortunate.''
 At four giant staging areas across the region, FEMA is assembling tens of thousands of mobile homes and trailers. In Baton Rouge alone, at a former Defense Department logistics center, thousands of them are already lined up on a field.
 So many new homes are needed that small-scale developments of 50 or 100 homes will simply not suffice. FEMA is thinking like the onetime Soviet planners, mapping out new towns that in some cases will have as many as 25,000 mobile homes, spread across hundreds of acres. 
 More than 25 so-called strike teams are deployed across Louisiana, scouting out possible sites for these new boom towns, negotiating with local officials and attempting to draft leases or sales agreements for farmland or camp sites. The teams have been formed by giant global engineering firms including Bechtel National Inc. of San Francisco and Fluor Corporation, of Aliso Viejo, Calif., which last week won no-bid contracts worth $100 million each.
 The men and women in charge are used to building things like trash incinerators, coal-fired electricity plants and oil fields in Saudi Arabia. They admit they will not be applying too much creativity to these new communities that will be created at a pace that would have made the master planner Robert Moses weep.
 ''We are a lot of right-brained guys, nothing too artistic,'' said Don Stokley, a structural engineer from Fluor, who is managing the company's strike teams.
 To meet FEMA's needs, factories are churning out the trailers and mobile homes at full capacity. The agency is also buying homes from lots and warehouses across the country. 
 James C. Schwab, a research associate at the American Planning Association in Chicago, said the FEMA should be careful to not create communities that are so dense and sterile that no one wants to live there.
 ''You are in a difficult spot, where you need housing quickly,'' he said. ''But you have got to try to humanize it as much as possible.''
 FEMA officials say they realize that they cannot just drop 75,000 people into rural, one-stoplight towns. Classrooms, sewage treatment plants, stores, restaurants and medical centers will be built as well.
 By the end of Wednesday, FEMA expects to have installed 3,500 homes requested by the governor in Alabama, most of them set up in long rows at state parks. By Friday, FEMA and its contractors will have installed about 1,000 homes in the New Orleans area for workers helping to rebuild the city. The big test, though, is in places like Slidell, along the rural stretches outside devastated cities in Louisiana and Mississippi.
 The small compound in Slidell is one of the first new communities. It is tiny by comparison to the new towns that FEMA and its contractors are planning. Here, they are simply dropping as many new units as they can squeeze into an existing mobile home park.
 The homes in Slidell -- those so far are all 14 feet wide and 70 feet long and have three bedrooms -- arrive furnished with beds and box springs wrapped in plastic, a full-size refrigerator, a couch and living room chair. The homes are lined up exactly 11 feet apart.
 But if the experience here over the last few days is any example, the government is going to have a difficult time meeting its goal of 30,000 units every two weeks. 
 It will be perhaps three weeks, a Fluor official predicted, before the 125 new homes being dropped here are ready for occupancy.
 Reinhard Dearing, a top city official in Slidell, had recently come up with a new nickname for FEMA, ''Nonexistent Emergency Management Agency,'' or NEMA, he said, given the department's slow response to requests by individuals for assistance. But even with the extended schedule provided on Monday by Jim Hlavaty, the general superintendent from Fluor, the Slidell city officials said they were impressed.
 ''These guys here know what they need to do, and they are doing it,'' Mr. Dearing said. ''At least they are getting something done.''
 As of Sunday, fewer than 10 families in Louisiana had moved into the first new homes. In Patterson, La., 120 miles southwest of Slidell, FEMA officials installed smaller, two-bedroom trailers. To their new occupants, emerging from shelters that held up to 1,000 people, the compact units were all but a palace.
 It is not clear how long these new FEMA-created towns will last. Temporary housing built for shipyard workers during World War II in cities like Richmond, Calif., was occupied for decades. FEMA officials say that is not their objective; they will own the units and move people out when they are ready.
 ''These temporary homes will come out,'' Mr. Gair of FEMA said. ''We want to rebuild New Orleans. We do not want to create a state of travel trailers and mobile home parks.''

DATELINE: POLLOCK, La., Sept. 11 

 BODY:
Sunday after church, Tracy Jackson braided extensions into her Auntie's hair on the back porch as her boyfriend, Jerel Brown, relaxed on a rocker, trading insults with a nurse named Mary as though he had known her his whole 24 years instead of five crazy days.
 The men plopped piles of catfish into a Dutch oven of boiling oil over a gas fire in the yard, while the children -- the ones from New Orleans who are afraid of spiders and snakes, and the ones who grew up in this hamlet driving four-wheelers and shooting their first deer at age 6 -- played on a rusty swing set at the woods' edge.
Then the matriarch, Judy Delcomyn, called the throng together to join hands and bow heads. 
 ''I thank you, Lord, for this precious family,'' she prayed. Around the circle stood her husband, Jack, three of their daughters -- including Mary -- and their husbands, seven Delcomyn grandbabies, Ms. Jackson, Mr. Brown, their four children, the friend they call Auntie and a 15-year-old nephew. ''We're family now,'' Mrs. Delcomyn said simply. 
 Eight days before, the Jackson-Browns were stuck in a sweltering line of desperate humanity outside the New Orleans airport, not a penny in their pockets, pushing their few possessions along with the sickly children in a skycap's cart, destination unknown. Now, they have four rooms plus a kitchenette and a bath upstairs at the Delcomyns' converted fishing camp here, with donated clothing overflowing dresser drawers and shelves stacked with cookies and candy bought on a replenished food-stamp card.
 The eyes that had been frightened and forlorn have turned bright with hopeful smiles. The grownups wear new rhinestone earrings, the girls ribbons and barrettes to match each outfit. They were hungry, and now they are full.
 But they have had a hard time finding R&B amid the country stations out here in Pollock, 236 miles from their former apartment in the shadow of the Superdome. The nearest store is miles away, and neither Ms. Jackson nor Mr. Brown has a driver's license. The 2000 census found no African-Americans among Pollock's 376 residents, and they already see tinges of racism: an 18-wheeler tried to run the pickup they were riding in off the road, they say, and a mother pulled her child into another checkout line at Wal-Mart.
 ''I'm not used to the country, but it's nice for the moment,'' Mr. Brown said, suggesting he might soon move to Texas or Atlanta or Raleigh, N.C., to join scattered relatives. ''It's a place to rebuild at, but not to stay.'' 
 Still, Mr. Brown has secured a 30-day tryout at a lumberyard where one of the Delcomyns' sons-in-law is a supervisor, and he is ready to join their tiny country church, where he wept at the altar Sunday. The two older children started school Friday.
 ''When you're around a family of love,'' he said, ''you feel your family is being loved, too.''
 Hurricane Katrina hit hardest among have-nots like the Jackson-Browns, who were unemployed, and whose $2,000 cash savings burned with their belongings in a fire after they fled the flood. But as hundreds of thousands of New Orleans refugees continue to huddle in hotels and makeshift shelters in far-flung cities, this family has found a true, if temporary, home. 
 Though the Jackson-Browns were profiled in The New York Times last Monday, the Delcomyns had not seen the article when they decided to adopt the family, and only one reader has so far tracked them down, sending a donation that has not yet arrived. 
 The family's odyssey from chaos to comfort is a Cinderella story of luck and pluck, of generosity and goodness, of landing in the unlikeliest of places at exactly the right time to connect with people who were yearning to help.
 They left New Orleans about 7 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 3, in the last-row of an air-conditioned coach, unsure where it was headed. Turned away from two full shelters, they finally disembarked about 3 a.m. Sunday, Sept. 4, into a long-empty Wal-Mart in the town of Pineville, La.
 When a stranger handed them $50 in the parking lot that afternoon, they rushed across the street to a Days Inn, checking into Room 207 for $44. The next morning, Mr. Brown cried on the shoulder of Brenda Frierson, a hotel housekeeper, who called her pastor to see if he could help. 
 ''I was looking at it, if I was in that situation, if it would be me, what would I want someone to do for me?'' Ms. Frierson explained later.
 The pastor's wife, Jean Carrington, said she knew of an empty trailer, but it had plumbing problems, so the Jackson-Browns returned to the Wal-Mart shelter, where at least they could get medicine for Waynenisha, who suffers from seizures and is mentally handicapped, and for the sores the younger ones had from sleeping in the squalid Superdome and Convention Center. 
 ''It was so touching because he was crying out,'' Mrs. Carrington recalled of Mr. Brown. ''He said, 'I need help, I don't want to hurt nobody, I just need help.' He said, 'I want to keep my family together.' It just broke my heart.''
 Back at the shelter, Jack Delcomyn, a training officer at the Pineville Fire Department who just happens to belong to the Carringtons' church, the Oak Grove Apostolic House of Prayer, helped the Jackson-Browns line up seven cots in a corner, under an old Wal-Mart sign offering 50 percent off Simplicity and McCall's sewing patterns. A police officer procured a thick air mattress for Mr. Brown, whose back is still sensitive from the time he got shot at 18 in a family dispute. There was a purple stuffed Barney doll for Alexis, who turns 2 in November.
 Mrs. Delcomyn said that as soon as she heard about the devastation in New Orleans, she went upstairs to clean the spare rooms where her daughters had grown up, in hopes of taking in a refugee family. She had already considered several candidates, but one was too bossy, others too weak to climb stairs. Mr. Delcomyn was convinced that the Jackson-Browns were the ones, and Tuesday night he and Mrs. Carrington helped pack their things into two pickups.
 The lone blue plastic bin the family had carried from New Orleans was joined now by a big green suitcase, piles of blankets and pillows, three garbage bags full of clothes, a baby stroller filled with toys, even two Stephen King paperbacks. On her way out, Ms. Jackson filled two boxes from the size-sorted donations in the Wal-Mart warehouse: a denim dress with silver studs for Waynenisha, a blue-and-white checked romper for Alexis, beige cargo pants for 3-year-old Anthony, sneakers for Devont'e, 5, underwear and socks for everyone.
 ''You can't break down, man,'' A.J. Thomas, 33, another evacuee who had befriended Mr. Brown at the shelter, said as they hugged goodbye. ''If you ever get depressed, Isaiah 43: He didn't bring you through the storm to leave you.''
 Walking past the ''Welcome'' banner with the heart-shaped American flag on the Delcomyns' wraparound porch, Ms. Jackson started at the three mounted deer heads hanging over the living-room couch. ''I'm scared of deers,'' she told Mrs. Delcomyn. ''I'm scared of bugs,'' she added later. ''I'm scared of butterflies.''
 So they have mostly stayed inside, the grownups watching horror movies like ''Cursed'' on the 62-inch screen downstairs, the little ones parked in front of Disney cartoons on the second floor. Ms. Jackson found her food-stamp card had been automatically filled with its monthly $505, so she went shopping at Wal-Mart and Walgreen's, bringing home a 32-ounce Whitman's Sampler box of chocolates as a treat. Mr. Delcomyn, a smoker himself, took his guests acarton of Kools.
 On Thursday, Ms. Jackson helped Mrs. Delcomyn at the twice-weekly Backpack program she runs for toddlers, while Mr. Brown returned to the Pineville shelter with Mr. Delcomyn as a volunteer. Mr. Brown earned $20 for mowing Mr. Delcomyn's lawn, $30 for a neighbor's; at church on Sunday, a lady handed him $25 just for being there. 
 When the Delcomyns left Friday for a funeral in Mississippi, they left the Jackson-Browns alone overnight. They returned Saturday at 9 p.m. to plates of pan-fried steak, cheesy mashed potatoes and broccoli, sweet potato pie still warm on the stove. 
 ''You feel like you're at home,'' Ms. Jackson said. ''They don't treat us like we're strangers at all, they talk to us like they talk to other family.''
 There are a few house rules. Mr. Delcomyn warned Mr. Brown, who said he used to smoke five nickel-bags -- about eight grams -- of marijuana each day, that no drugs were allowed, period. ''And I told him if y'all going to be around awhile, you have to get married,'' Mr. Delcomyn said. ''My wife don't allow unmarried people sleeping together.'' 
 Neither Mr. Brown or Ms. Jackson finished high school, but now a Delcomyn daughter is looking into G.E.D. classes. They are torn -- missing the second-line dancing and other signatures of their city life, but appreciating the calm, close-knit feel of family in the country. 
 ''A lot of things we left behind us in our past I hope not to do anymore,'' Mr. Brown said. ''Before the storm hit we were talking about changing our lives. Since the storm hit, it's happening fast.''
 Before the storm, Ms. Jackson had not been to church in two years, Mr. Brown since he was baptized in 1993. This week, they went Wednesday night, and twice on Sunday.
 In the tiny Oak Grove chapel, as the few dozen worshipers praised Jesus, Mrs. Delcomyn, the eldest of seven siblings who spent time in foster care, stood to testify.
 ''I remember as a child being hungry,'' she said, crying. ''I remember this one man, he was delivering bread, he stopped and he give us some food.
 ''These precious people, and all the other ones here, they need us to give them bread. They need us to feed them, and they need us to love them.''
 Ms. Jackson helped Mrs. Delcomyn teach Sunday school, singing along with the little ones, ''I have C-H-R-I-S-T in my H-E-A-R-T.'' Mr. Brown sat in the sanctuary's back pew, hands folded as the congregation clapped. But he opened his Bible during the preacher's sermon, and after a while joined in the chorus of amens.
 Then he asked the pastor to read Psalm 91 aloud, and he mouthed along, ''I will say of the Lord, he is my refuge.''

HEADLINE: Louisiana Film Production Faces Uncertainty 

BYLINE: By SHARON WAXMAN

DATELINE: TORONTO, Sept. 12 

 BODY:
A rollicking New Orleans jazz band enlivened a Monday breakfast session meant to convince movie producers at the Toronto International Film Festival that the burgeoning Louisiana film industry was still viable.
 But a more sober reality was not far below the surface: Louisiana faces a daunting challenge to convince Hollywood producers, who were lured to the state in recent years by generous tax incentives, to continue bringing their productions here.
 ''Deja Vu,'' a big-budget Disney film that was shooting in New Orleans when Hurricane Katrina hit, moved out of state to continue production, as did ''The Last Time,'' starring Brendan Fraser and Michael Keaton, Louisiana producers and state officials said. 
 Another Disney film, ''Guardian,'' starring Kevin Costner, with an estimated budget of $150 million, will continue to film in the state, relocating north to Shreveport, the officials said. A Disney representative confirmed the decision. ''The Reaping,'' a Warner Brothers thriller starring Hilary Swank, is shooting in Baton Rouge, after a break of a few days for the storm. 
 Louisiana film executives insisted that the state could still accommodate productions, despite the catastrophic damage to New Orleans and surrounding areas, where the overwhelming majority of film production occurs. 
 ''Film production can still come to Louisiana,'' said Will French, who heads Louisiana Production Capital, a company that helps producers navigate the tax incentive system. ''It's not as bad as CNN makes it look.'' He displayed a map to demonstrate that many parts of New Orleans have no flooding at the moment. 
 And the producer Michel Shane announced that he had moved production of the upcoming fantasy-drama ''Paranoia,'' directed by Tony Kaye, from Brazil to Louisiana, to help the state. 
 ''We sat down and decided it would be great empowerment for Louisiana to go there, take displaced people, and put them back to work,'' Mr. Shane said. 
 Neither of the state's top two film officials, the director of the governor's office of film and television, and the director of the entertainment division in the state's economic development office, were present at the Toronto festival. 
 Speaking from Baton Rouge, where he had just relocated, Alex Schott, the director of the governor's film office, said Louisiana had lost a couple of film productions because of the hurricane but hoped not to lose many more. 
 ''Right now our efforts are in relocating productions to other parts of the state,'' he said. ''We're going to fight for every one we can. We realize that we might lose one or two, but over all the conversations I've had have been very positive.'' 
 Film production has become a crucial source of income for Louisiana, which in 2002 adopted among the most aggressive tax incentives in the country. An estimated 20 movies will be shot in the state this year, with a direct economic benefit estimated at $125 million. (While the total budgets of films shot in Louisiana is higher, not all of the money is spent in the state.) 
 This year the state legislature voted to curtail those incentives starting next year, when the tax credit will be limited to money spent in the state. Asked if the new law, combined with hurricane damage, might make keeping production in the state more difficult, Mr. Schott pointed out that the tax credit had been raised to 25 percent from 18 percent, though that figure would now apply only to direct expenditures in the state. 
 ''We are rising to this challenge, but it certainly will be a challenge,'' he said.
 And even at Monday's upbeat event, the difficulties ahead were evident. Stuart Benjamin, a producer of last year's ''Ray,'' which was shot in Louisiana, was supposed to announce his intention to film an action movie about a hurricane, ''Hurricane Chaser,'' in the state. But on reflection, he hesitated. ''I think we're going to make the movie,'' he said. ''But it's a bit premature.''

HEADLINE: A High School Confidential From the Inside

BYLINE: By ANITA GATES

 BODY:
Early in Victor Buhler's documentary ''Rikers High,'' a high school teacher is discussing Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley's novel ''Frankenstein.'' People are afraid of the monster because he looks different, the teacher, identified as Mr. Rodriguez, says. He asks the young men in his class, ''Is it rightfully so to be judged by the way you look?'' (Economy of phrase is obviously not a priority in this classroom.) When people treat him badly, the monster reacts with anger and ''anything in his path gets destroyed.''
 This is something the students may be able to understand all too well. They are Rikers Island inmates, among the 2,000 or so who are under 18. Those serving sentences of two years or less are required to attend Island Academy there, to work toward a G.E.D., or general equivalency diploma. The student body is predominantly black; to see a white face in the crowd is rare. 
 Watching ''Rikers High,'' an engaging, sharply observant film, is an exercise in frustration. The situation looks bleak. 
 At the end, the film notes that ''there are 130,000 teenagers behind bars in the United States'' and that ''eight out of 10 will be rearrested within a year of their release.'' But viewers could have predicted that. 
 The teachers shown may be brilliant and may have begun their jobs determined to make a difference, but in these scenes some don't seem to be trying very hard. 
 When one teacher asks William Santiago, 18, to define impulsive behavior, the young man gives an example of compulsive behavior instead. The teacher doesn't correct him. 
 Andre Blandon, who turns 19 in jail, tells a social worker that although he has been instructed to take Zoloft every day, ''I only take it when I feel like I need it.'' Either no one has explained to Mr. Blandon that Zoloft is a drug that needs to build up in the bloodstream through daily use (rather than something that takes effect 30 minutes after ingestion) or he doesn't understand it. On camera at least, the social worker makes no effort to explain.
 But the faculty's attitude is partly understandable. Mr. Santiago seems to have trouble focusing. Rather than answering a question, he jumps up from his chair and announces that he has lost something. When the required G.E.D. test is administered, one boy just puts his head on his desk and goes to sleep. Officer Hopson, who has worked at Rikers for 32 years, says he isn't surprised to encounter inmates who can't read; he has met some who don't know how to tell time. 
 The prisoners' parents don't appear to be much help. During visits and telephone calls they either criticize or preach. One young man says his family is better off when he is in jail because things go more smoothly at home without him. 
 During filming, Mr. Santiago was serving six months for robbery; he was armed with a cigarette lighter that looked like a gun. Mr. Blandon, a talented artist whose cartoon characters are seen on screen, had been sentenced to a year for arson; he set a car on fire as part of an insurance scam.
 ''Rikers High'' touches on other young men's stories. Shawn Johnson, who is serving eight months for armed robbery, tells a release planner that he is thinking about college and wants to become a philosopher. The planner doesn't talk to him about how philosophers earn a living these days. She just asks why he wants to go to college.
 Last week PBS showed a documentary about Rafe Esquith, a remarkable fifth-grade teacher in California who has inspired many students from poor families to overcome their circumstances. It would be nice to believe that Mr. Esquith could make a difference in these young men's lives. But this film seems to suggest that it is already too late.

HEADLINE: Rooms, Yes. But Don't Expect Service.

BYLINE: By GARY RIVLIN

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Sept. 11 

 BODY:
Despite an exodus by hundreds of thousands of residents, and attempts to forcibly remove those remaining behind, New Orleans is no ghost town. At the Royal Sonesta Hotel on Bourbon Street, a small line formed at the front desk on Sunday.
 One man, wallet splayed on a handsome wooden counter, was paying for his stay. Another waited, only to be told by the hotel's general manager, Hans U. Wandfluh, that there were no rooms available.
Mr. Wandfluh, with white hair and courtly manner, has not left the Royal Sonesta in the two weeks since Hurricane Katrina hit -- unless one counts the few times he has walked a block in either direction to catch a glimpse of the outside world. He prowls the stately lobby, with its marble floors and working fountain, dressed in a loose-fitting pair of striped cotton pants and a turquoise and purple polo shirt. The lobby was surprisingly cool, given the French Quarter was still without electricity as of Sunday and the hotel was operating solely on an emergency generator. 
 In the tradition of a ship's captain, Mr. Wandfluh is part of a select group of hoteliers who have chosen to stick with their properties come hell or high water. They have gotten both, but have managed to stay open with limited amenities and a barebones staff since the storm hit on Aug. 29. Their guests include a revolving door of government officials, firefighters and police officers, health care workers, insurance agents and the media. Some are staying at reduced rates or at no charge. 
 Room service definitely is not included. 
 Their pluck has helped keep a critical number of hotels open for rescue workers, and now the hotels could serve as a foundation for rebuilding the city. ''My thinking has been that I want to keep this place intact so when all of this is over, 500 people can make a living here again,'' said Mr. Wandfluh, who has been running the Royal Sonesta for 26 years. 
 Most hotels in New Orleans, of course, are closed for business. The city's two towering W Hotels, for instance, were damaged too severely to accept guests, even emergency workers, a company spokesman said. At one, the windows on one entire side were blown out. The Hotel Monaco and Hotel InterContinental New Orleans are dark, as are most of the boutique hotels around the Quarter. 
 But guests able to find a vacancy are elated, even if they have had to drastically lower their expectations. Meals these days at the Royal Sonesta are hardly four-star elegant, for example. A tub of peanut butter sits on one table in the lobby, beside it sits a bowl of green apples. Mr. Wandfluh still has a chef working, and a second employee doubles as a waiter, though there is not much to work with.
 Mr. Wandfluh, who turns 70 on Tuesday, said he began the storm with 160 employees holed up at the hotel. All but 22 left in a panic, many of them ending up at either the Superdome or the convention center, he said. 
 Nearly 200 of the Royal Sonesta's 500 rooms are occupied, Mr. Wandfluh said. Some rooms are occupied by Mr. Wandfluh, whose home was destroyed, and his staff. The rest are filled by paying guests, which the hotel started accepting at the end of last week; they vary from Federal Emergency Management Agency workers to agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation to a crew from CNN. 
 Mr. Wandfluh did not want to say for the record precisely what he was charging, but his guests are paying ''significantly less'' than the $179 to $250 a night they would normally spend for a room this time of year.
 Dan King, the general manager of the Sheraton New Orleans, a 49-story tower that soars above Canal Street, also has not left his post since the storm hit, when more than 1,000 guests were stranded there. 
 The guests slept in the hotel's grand ballroom the night before the hurricane because that room has no windows. ''We all had one big slumber party,'' Mr. King, 51, said. The hotel served a full breakfast, including eggs, bacon and fresh-squeezed orange juice, at around the same time the storm hit ''to keep everyone's mind occupied,'' he said.
 By Wednesday, two days after the storm, Mr. King had secured buses to get every guest out of town. All but a half-dozen or so of the hotel's 150 employees were sent to Dallas, the closest Sheraton with available rooms, and most are still there. 
 Yet even before the stranded guests were dispatched elsewhere, others, including firefighters and 100 officers from a nearby police station, started filling up rooms at the Sheraton. More recently, emergency doctors, federal marshals and other rescue workers have been taking rooms -- at no charge, Mr. King said.
 ''We don't feel right charging, given the circumstances,'' said Mr. King, who was dressed in a black T-shirt, shorts and jogging shoes.
 Two other hotel managers who have remained at their properties since the hurricane include Peter Ambros of the Astor Crowne Plaza, a stately stone building on Canal, and Melissa Kennedy, the general manager of the Best Western Parc St. Charles, several blocks off Canal in the central business district. Both hotels operate under the banner of the Decatur Hotels.
 ''We've tried to make them leave, to give them a break,'' said F. Patrick Quinn III, who owns and operates Decatur Hotels and its 10 properties in and around the French Quarter. ''But they won't leave.''
 Mr. Ambros, 61, who has been working in the hotel business since he was a teenager, said he felt an obligation to stay as long as there were people sleeping under his roof. ''I would not leave so long as I have a single guest or any employee here,'' he said. 
 It had been a rough two weeks for all of them as the Astor served for nearly a week as a kind of privately run shelter for hundreds, though without running water or electricity. 
 Around 2,000 people, most of them locals, had sought refuge at the Astor or one of its nine other Decatur Hotels. All of them became Mr. Ambros's concern as the company consolidated everyone at the 14-story, 707-room Astor.
 Mr. Quinn's son Patrick, Decatur's head of sales, reached a friend in the fuel business who was able to secure enough diesel not only to refill the generators at their properties, but also at other nearby hotels and the local aquarium.
 The buses, however, did not arrive until the weekend after the hurricane hit. At that point 200 people -- including 49 sick or elderly people and 69 children, including a newborn less than two weeks old -- were still at the hotel.
 ''The military and police -- people in authority -- kept coming by and telling us, 'Send these people to the convention center, send them to the Dome,''' Mr. Ambros said. ''But I was going over there a couple of times a day to check it out myself. There was no way I was sending any of my people over there.'' 
 Guests flushed toilets using water from the swimming pool. Meals were prepared by the two main chefs from anything that had not spoiled. That was supplemented by the $3,000 Mr. Quinn spent at a Baton Rouge Wal-Mart on the Tuesday after the hurricane ''buying up every PowerBar and jar of peanut butter they had in the place.'' Water was rationed by room. 
 ''We were very fortunate that we had a police officer among our guests,'' Mr. Ambros said. ''He stayed with us because he felt it was more important to help us than helping one person out there.'' 
 Mr. Wandfluh might have felt understaffed but he had a veritable battalion compared with Ms. Kennedy, 31, at the Parc St. Charles. She had only the help of her husband -- who was armed with a shotgun -- one of his friends and three dogs.
 On Aug. 31, a group of around 20 tried to break into the hotel, Ms. Kennedy said. ''They waited until they got real close,'' she said, speaking of her husband and his friend. ''And then they shined a light in their face and cocked the shotgun to scare them away.''
 Until this past weekend, Ms. Kennedy's hotel had offered a comfortable refuge to journalists. She and a staff of maybe five snaked tubes through the hallways of the few occupied floors to offer a makeshift air-conditioning system operated by an emergency generator. 
 Now the hotel will house some of the hundreds of people Mr. Quinn has hired since the storm to secure, clean up and fix his 10 properties. 
 ''Our job now is to get all of our properties open as fast as we can for business,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Envoys Reach Compromise on Scaled-Back U.N. Reform Plans 

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 12 

 BODY:
Faced with the imminent arrival of more than 170 presidents and prime ministers, negotiators agreed Monday to resolve differences blocking acceptance of the centerpiece document for this week's summit meeting on combating poverty and reforming the United Nations.
 The breakthrough, ending three weeks of tense day and night talks, occurred late Monday when ambassadors adopted compromise language across a range of issues.
 The changes undercut the ambitions and scope of the 45-page document, but brought an end to an impasse that had threatened the United Nations with fresh embarrassment just a week after findings of mismanagement and corruption in the oil-for-food program were reported by Paul A. Volcker, a former Federal Reserve chairman who headed an investigation into the program. 
 The final version was expected to emerge Tuesday, the eve of the three-day gathering of world leaders.
 ''What we can say now is that we will have a document that will reflect what is politically possible right now among 191 members,'' said Gunter Pleuger, the German ambassador.
 ''It may not be the great reform idea that Kofi Annan put into the world two years ago and might not meet with the excitement of all member states and of the press, but it will be an important step in the direction of a basic reform of the U.N.,'' he said.
 Jean-Marc de la Sabliere, the French ambassador, said, ''The text is not an ideal text, but there is enough substance in it for us to have a good summit.''
 The United States delegation also tried to put a good face on the outcome, though it expressed disappointment in not obtaining pledges for thorough management reform.
 Noting that the proposals fell far short of ''the kind of cultural revolution that we need in United Nations management and governance,'' John R. Bolton, the United States ambassador, said: ''Reform is not a one-night stand. Reform is forever. That's why we're going to continue to work on it.''
 Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, speaking to reporters and editors at The New York Times, said, ''If there's a concern right now with the U.N., it is that we really do need a strong reform agenda on the key issues -- management reform, secretariat reform.'' The draft document addresses seven main issues: a new human rights council to replace the discredited human rights commission; steps to promote development and reduce poverty; a new peace-building commission; a management overhaul; nuclear nonproliferation; terrorism and a measure to allow international intervention when countries fail to protect their populations from genocide.
 In many cases, the solution was to substitute specific goals with broad statements of principle, leaving the details to the upcoming yearlong General Assembly session.
 Progress had stalled over management reform because of resistance by some countries to proposals by the United States, Europe and other big donor countries to vest more power and executive flexibility in the secretary general's office. The nations of the developing world say they are reluctant to cede power from the General Assembly.
 Max Lawson, a policy adviser for the aid organization Oxfam International, said groups like his were let down by watered-down language on development assistance.
 ''We are really depressed,'' he said. ''We are left clawing our way back to commitments made three years ago. When we start defining success as simply standing still, that's a terrible situation to be in.''

HEADLINE: Leftist Coalition Seems to Be the Winner in Norway's Election 

BYLINE: BY WALTER GIBBS

DATELINE: OSLO, Sept. 12 

 BODY:
By a narrow margin, Norwegian voters appeared Monday to have transferred power from their center-right government to a left-wing coalition headed by the Labor Party leader, Jens Stoltenberg.
 Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik refrained from conceding defeat, but with more than 90 percent of the vote counted, most analysts agreed that Mr. Stoltenberg's ''red-green alliance'' of the Labor Party, Socialist Left Party and Center Party had won a slim parliamentary majority, ending four years of weak minority rule under Mr. Bondevik. 
 ''I'm finally ready to call it,'' Frank Aarebrot, a University of Bergen election analyst, said at 11:30 p.m. ''The red-green wins it.''
 A new government here could prove a minor irritant to the Bush administration.
 ''The most important thing the Americans will notice is that the main lines of Norwegian foreign policy will remain fixed,'' Mr. Stoltenberg, 46, said in a pre-election television appearance. ''But they will also notice that we pull back our soldiers from Iraq.''
 Mr. Bondevik's government was divided over the invasion of Iraq but afterward dispatched a token corps of 10 officers to help rebuild the country.
 On Monday night Mr. Stoltenberg and his partners on the left seemed set to control some 88 seats in the 169-seat Parliament when it reopens in mid-October. That would be enough to let him expand the state's role in social matters while enhancing environmental protections and reinstating some of the taxes that Mr. Bondevik has cut.
 Under Mr. Bondevik's fragile coalition of Christian Democrats, Conservatives and Liberals, Norway experienced a surge in prosperity, with the stock market tripling since early 2003 on the strength of oil exports. Interest rates fell sharply, personal incomes rose and the United Nations Development Program designated Norway the best country in the world in which to live.
 But letting the good times roll is not really the Scandinavian way. Even at the cost of moderately higher taxes, most Norwegians on Monday seemed intent on protecting or expanding generous sick-leave, pregnancy-leave and job-security policies along with subsidized day care and free college tuition.
 Like Mr. Stoltenberg, Mr. Bondevik campaigned as a champion of social spending, but his commitment to keeping interest rates low and cutting future taxes made him seem the guardian of a business-friendly status quo. He also lost votes to the far right Progress Party, which became Norway's second-largest party on Monday. It demanded even larger tax cuts than Mr. Bondevik was willing to countenance and proposed balancing the budget by raiding an oil-revenue fund set up to serve future generations.
 Hanne Marthe Narud, a political science professor at the University of Oslo, said Labor's resurgence after four years in opposition was historic because of Mr. Stoltenberg's embrace of parties to his left. Since World War II, Labor has been dominant enough to rule by itself most of the time.
 ''It is the only Social Democratic party in western Europe that has never been in a coalition government,'' Professor Narud said. ''Its poor showing in 2001 forced it to change strategy. Now Stoltenberg has rebuilt the image of the party and radicalized the profile.''
 Critics said the Labor leader might have a hard time managing his new partners, even though the Socialist Left and Center Party combined will control less than a third of the projected 62 seats belonging to Labor.

HEADLINE: New Zealand Named Best Nation for Business

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 12 

 BODY:
The World Bank has concluded that New Zealand is the most business-friendly nation in the world and that Serbia and Montenegro made the biggest pro-business changes last year.
 In a study to be released on Tuesday, the World Bank said that New Zealand and Singapore were the easiest countries to do business in. The United States came in third, followed by Canada. 
 In its report, the World Bank ranked 155 countries based on classic American assumptions about economic success, like the idea that less red tape is better than more. The study looked at factors like the number of days it takes to get approval for starting a business, the ease or difficulty of hiring and firing workers, the ability of creditors to recoup their money when a company goes bankrupt, and the ability to enforce contracts in court.
 As in the past, most of those at the top of the list are wealthy and technologically advanced, like Australia, Britain, Denmark, Hong Kong and Norway. Hong Kong, a semiautonomous region of China, placed seventh, while China itself placed only 91st out of 155. 
 But the World Bank said the formerly communist nations of Central Europe had made some of the biggest advances in supporting private business. Two former Soviet republics -- Lithuania, in 14th place, and Estonia, in 15th -- ranked ahead of Switzerland, Belgium and Germany. Among the countries that made the biggest changes in 2004 were Serbia and Montenegro, Slovakia, Latvia and Romania.
 Countries that rank at the very top in terms of friendliness to business were not necessarily easy places to be a worker. The United States and New Zealand, for example, were the only two countries in the rankings that imposed no requirement at all to give severance pay to workers who had been laid off.
 Many countries, particularly in Western Europe, maintain an elaborate array of laws regulating the pay and hours of workers as well as restrictions that make it expensive and difficult to fire them. 
 Supporters of such laws say they provide workers with a social safety net. A growing number of economists in the United States note that American workers have been exposed to steadily higher uncertainty about job security and are increasingly forced to work as self-employed contractors who can be laid off without notice and do not receive health insurance or retirement benefits.
 But the World Bank report contends that countries with more rigid labor laws also tended to have higher unemployment. 
 On average, the bank said, unemployment was lowest in countries with the easiest rules for doing business and highest in countries with the most difficult rules. Countries with rigid workplace rules also tended to have greater rates of youth unemployment and a smaller share of women in the work force.
 But being friendly to business was not the same as having no rules at all. Afghanistan has almost no barriers to starting a business and to firing workers. But it also offers almost no protection for investor rights and almost no ability to enforce contracts in court. At 122nd, it ranked among the most difficult countries in the world to do business in.

HEADLINE: Army Expects To Miss Goals For Recruiting

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 12 

 BODY:
The Army posted its best recruiting month in four years in August, but will still miss its annual recruiting goal for the first time since 1999, officials said Monday.
 In August, the regular Army sent more recruits to boot camp than in any other month since July 2001. But the part-time Army National Guard and Army Reserve both missed their monthly goals and will fall far short of their annual goals for the 2005 fiscal year, which ends this month. 
 The regular Army, which is aiming for 80,000 recruits this year, was behind its year-to-date goal by the end of August, with too big a deficit to make up through September's recruiting, officials said. 
 The Marine Corps made its August goal and was 2 percent ahead of its year-to-date goal. The Air Force and Navy both achieved their targets.
 Reflecting the regular Army's struggle, the situation was worse in the National Guard, which is under the command of state governors, and in the Reserve. These part-time troops can be called to active duty by the Pentagon; they now make up about 40 percent of the United States force in Iraq.
 The Army National Guard has missed its recruiting targets every month this fiscal year and appeared certain to miss its third straight annual recruiting goal.
 The Guard missed its recruiting goal by 18 percent in August and was 12,683, or 22 percent, behind its year-to-date goal. Its recruiting goal for this fiscal year is 63,002.
 The Army Reserve, which last missed an annual goal in 1999, was short of its August target by 9 percent and was 19 percent behind its year-to-date target. It will also miss its 2005 goal of 28,485 recruits.
 The Army has attributed the recruiting shortfalls to a growing wariness about military service because of the Iraq war and an economy that was creating more civilian jobs.
 The Army has increased financial incentives for enlistment, added recruiters and bought advertisements appealing to patriotism.
 In July, the Pentagon asked Congress to raise the maximum age for military enlistment to 42. The ceiling now is 35 for active duty and 39 for the Reserves or National Guard.

HEADLINE: China Exports Up 32% in August

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: BEIJING, Sept. 12 

 BODY:
China recorded its third-largest monthly trade surplus on record in August, a performance likely to sustain foreign pressure for a further rise in the value of the yuan.
 The surplus was $10 billion, down from $10.4 billion in July, even though imports rose 23.4 percent from a year earlier.
 Exports did even better, surging by 32.1 percent despite a 2 percent revaluation of the yuan on July 21, to a rate around 8.1 to the dollar, and the reimposition of quotas by the European Union and the United States on Chinese textile exports. 
 Economists said the vigor of China's exports would add to strains with its trading partners, noting that the central bank chief and some of his deputies had made clear in recent days that they would tread carefully before allowing the yuan to increase in value much further. Xiao Minjie, an economist with the Daiwa Institute of Research in Shanghai, said, ''China's rising trade surplus will definitely fuel trade frictions.''
 The largest one-month Chinese trade surplus, of $11.1 billion, occurred last December.
 In the first eight months of 2005, China has posted trade surpluses each month, totaling $60.2 billion, compared with $32 billion in all of 2004. The United States, which is running trade deficits, had an imbalance in June of $58.8 billion. 
 Paul Cavey of Macquarie Research in Hong Kong said he expected the Chinese surplus to keep growing. ''The exchange-rate change and growth in oil inventories could add a few percentage points to import growth over the next few months,'' Mr. Cavey said, ''but fundamentally, there are good reasons for thinking import growth is going to be relatively slow and so the trade surplus will continue to rise.'' 
 He said China was now making more products it used to import, like steel and generating equipment.

HEADLINE: Katrina's Message on the Corps

 BODY:
There has been much grumbling that Congress and the Bush administration denied the Army Corps of Engineers the money that was required to fortify New Orleans against a hurricane like Katrina. These complaints need to be pursued. Flood control is mainly a federal obligation, and the agency most responsible for it must have enough money to do the job right. 
 But there is another question worth asking: has the Army Corps made wise use of the money it has? Louisiana has received about $1.9 billion over the past four years for corps civil works projects, more than any other state. Although much of this has been spent to protect New Orleans, a lot has also been spent on unrelated water projects -- a new and unnecessary lock in the New Orleans Industrial Canal, for instance, and dredging little-used waterways like the Red River -- mainly to serve the barge industry and other commercial interests.
 The Louisiana delegation, second to none in bringing home the bacon, is as much to blame for these skewed priorities as the corps is. Yet the reports of wasted dollars in Louisiana are consistent with the corps's historical profile. Studies by the Government Accountability Office, the National Academy of Sciences and others have documented that the agency has long inflated the economic payoffs of its projects to justify ever greater budget outlays, while underestimating the environmental damage caused by turning free-flowing rivers into lifeless canals and destroying millions of acres of valuable wetlands. This satisfies the corps's appetite for money and Congress's appetite for pork.
 Katrina thus raises an even broader question: has the time not come, finally, to impose some real discipline on the Army Corps and its paymasters in Congress who regard it as their own cookie jar? 
 Both the present commander, Lt. Gen. Carl Strock, and his predecessor have promised internal reforms. But the lead must come from Congress, where enlightened reformers like Senators John McCain and Russell Feingold are pushing independent peer review for individual projects and other changes that might truly make a difference.
 Unfortunately, many other senators -- not just those from Louisiana -- are powerfully addicted to corps projects and the votes they attract, especially Christopher Bond of Missouri, who controls the corps's budget and has single-handedly kept alive a nonessential barge industry on the Missouri River at great cost to the environment and taxpayers. To discipline the corps, Congress must first discipline itself.

HEADLINE: Poverty in America

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 In ''Broken Yardstick'' (Op-Ed, Sept. 9), Nicholas Eberstadt does not mention the fact that the real scandal in how poverty levels are calculated is that the measure is based on the old food basket concept and therefore hides the areas of greatest inflation: housing, health care and education. 
 Home ownership, access to health care and higher education are major components of the American dream and fast becoming unattainable by large segments of the population. While the poor may have better air-conditioning and lower mortality rates than in 1974, this is due to technological advances that were ultimately the result of research and development spending by ''big government'' before 1974.
The ''working poor'' are a creation of neo-liberal public policies, and attempting to make the poor invisible will not change that.

HEADLINE: Cost Estimates By Reinsurers Are Climbing 

BYLINE: By JENNIFER BAYOT

 BODY:
Gauging and absorbing risk may be what they do for a living, but even insurers seem taken aback by Hurricane Katrina.
 A handful of the world's leading reinsurers -- the companies that sell insurance to insurance companies -- suggested yesterday that the cost of settling claims would far surpass initial expectations, putting pressure on profits and probably leading to higher premiums for businesses and homeowners.
Swiss Re, the world's second-largest reinsurer, said its claims would top $1.2 billion, more than double the $500 million it had estimated on Aug. 31. The company, based in Zurich, said the higher payout would keep it from meeting its goal of 10 percent earnings growth this year. 
 Hannover Re of Germany warned that its projected $314 million in claims could climb further and that prices on property coverage were likely to rise. Montpelier Re, based in Bermuda, said that its claims would range from $450 million to $675 million-- ''a significant net loss for us," said Anthony Taylor, the chairman and chief executive.
 The rising estimates are among the few figures disclosed directly by companies, rather than by consulting firms that specialize in catastrophe modeling. Released even as New Orleans remains flooded, the estimates point to increasing anxiety over Katrina's ultimate financial cost. Most estimates suggest it will be the insurance industry's costliest natural disaster in American history. 
 Some reinsurers are among the companies that Standard & Poor's, the rating agency, said Friday were at risk of a credit downgrade; in the agency's opinion, the looming cost of Katrina may soon make these companies' debts less likely to be repaid.
 Some clues might be available in a report to be released today by AIR Worldwide, a risk management firm. The report, based on accounts from engineers who surveyed Louisiana and Mississippi last week, says that many buildings sustained more damage than comparable buildings in previous hurricanes and that the storm wreaked far more damage than Hurricane Ivan last year.
 Whatever the ultimate cost, some of it is expected to trickle down to customers. ''We are witnessing increasing natural catastrophe events across the globe, affecting economies and societies with a higher frequency and severity,'' John Coomber, Swiss Re's chief executive, said in a statement. ''Price levels in the upcoming renewals must be adjusted to reflect these developments.''

HEADLINE: Investors Mark Time as Acquisitions Help Tech Shares 

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Wall Street zigzagged through a listless session yesterday, closing mostly higher as a spate of multibillion-dollar acquisitions lifted the technology sector and energy prices extended their declines. The gains were limited by the airlines' troubles and worries about interest rates.
 The $12 billion in merger deals announced yesterday signaled optimism on Wall Street two weeks after Hurricane Katrina's devastation of the Gulf Coast threatened the United States economy. But analysts said the market was treading water while waiting to see if the Federal Reserve would raise rates again when policy makers meet next week. 
 Some analysts expect the Fed to refrain from further moves.
 ''I think we're coming to the end of it,'' Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management, said of the Fed's yearlong chain of rate increases. ''The rise of energy prices and the general impact of the hurricane would make it dangerous for the Fed to push rates higher and higher.''
 Oil and gasoline futures were pulled lower by reports that efforts to resume production are progressing after Katrina brought much of the Gulf Coast to a standstill, but officials say nearly 60 percent of the region's capacity remains blocked from the market.
 A barrel of light crude fell 74 cents, to $63.34, on the New York Mercantile Exchange, where gasoline futures also slipped 9 cents, to $1.87 a gallon.
 The technology sector rallied on news that the software maker Oracle plans to acquire a rival, Siebel Systems, and that the online auctioneer eBay is buying the Internet-telephone company Skype Technologies in deals worth a combined $8.45 billion. The Wachovia Corporation also agreed to acquire the car-financing company Westcorp.
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 4.38, or 0.04 percent, to 10,682.94. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 0.92, or 0.07 percent, to 1,240.56, while the Nasdaq composite index climbed 7.32, or 0.34 percent, to 2,182.83.
 Bonds ended lower, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rising to 4.17 percent, from 4.12 percent on Friday.
 The day's takeover deals were led by Oracle's purchase of Siebel, a maker of customer-management software, for $5.85 billion in cash and stock. Oracle's bid of $10.66 a share was a 16.8 percent premium over Siebel's closing price of $9.13 a share on Friday. Oracle rose 21 cents, to $13.49 a share, and Siebel jumped $1.16, or 12.7 percent, to $10.29 a share.
 Wachovia said that it planned to buy Westcorp for $3.42 billion and that it would pay $490 million to acquire the remaining 16 percent stake in a subsidiary, WFS Financial, not held by Westcorp. And eBay is paying $2.6 billion for Skype in a deal that could expand to $4.1 billion if performance targets are reached over the next three years. Wachovia fell 81 cents, to $49.57 a share; Westcorp rose 23 cents, to $61.58, and eBay advanced 32 cents, to $38.94.
 In the airline industry, reports said that Delta Air Lines could file for bankruptcy protection as soon as this week while it arranges $1.7 billion in financing for its restructuring. Also, mechanics at Northwest Airlines left the bargaining table Sunday, extending their strike to a fourth week. Delta plunged 25 cents, to a record low of 85 cents a share, and Northwest fell 17 cents, to $3.31.
 The Dow was carried higher by Citigroup, which rose 40 cents, to $45.01, a share, after a Prudential Equity analyst, Michael Mayo, raised his rating to overweight from neutral weight. Mr. Mayo said Citigroup stands to benefit from a recovering investment market, operating efficiencies and potential overseas growth.
 Campbell Soup, which also makes Godiva chocolate and Pepperidge Farm cookies, said higher prices and lower marketing costs helped lift its fourth-quarter profit 63 percent to beat Wall Street expectations. Nonetheless, Campbell lost 10 cents, to $30.99 a share.
 The following are the results of the Treasury's auction of three- and six-month bills.

HEADLINE: Ford Labor Pact in Canada Calls for 1,100 Job Cuts 

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM and IAN AUSTEN; Danny Hakim reported from Detroit for this article and Ian Austen from Oakville, Ontario.

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 12 

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company will cut 1,100 jobs in Canada by 2008, or about 9 percent of its hourly work force in that country, as part of a tentative agreement reached Monday with the Canadian Auto Workers union. 
 The agreement, which is subject to ratification by Ford's Canadian workers this coming weekend, comes as the company faces billions of dollars in losses in its North American automotive operations and is close to announcing what is likely to be a revamping plan that will bring a wave of job cuts in the United States.
Auto workers at Ford, General Motors and the Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler have pay and benefits that are the envy of other blue-collar workers. But withering competition from rivals like Toyota and the slump in the sale of large sport utility vehicles have led the automakers to take a hard line in recent labor negotiations, shrinking their work force to new lows. 
 The agreement on a new three-year contract with the Canadian Auto Workers includes the lowest increase in wages in that union's two-decade history. It also omits, for the first time, traditional perks like a signing bonus and an increase in the number of days off. 
 The job cuts will be made at Ford's operations in Windsor, Ontario, a Canadian city that sits across the border from Detroit and shares a dependence on auto jobs. As part of the agreement, Ford will close an engine casting plant in Windsor that dates to the 1920's. 
 ''It's going to strike a lot of Windsor families today when they get this news,'' said Buzz Hargrove, the president of the Canadian Auto Workers, during a news conference on Monday in Toronto. 
 The agreement is structured to trim jobs by encouraging early retirement; a payment to some workers who retire early increases to 70,000 Canadian dollars (about $59,000) from 60,000 Canadian dollars. Hourly wages would increase by 45 Canadian cents in the first year of the contract, then 30 cents in each of the two subsequent years, on top of cost-of-living adjustments.
 On a positive note for the union, an assembly plant in St. Thomas, Ontario, that makes the Ford Crown Victoria and Mercury Grand Marquis will receive about 200 million Canadian dollars in new investments.
 ''We faced one of the most difficult challenges in bargaining that we have in a good many years,'' Mr. Hargrove said, adding that ''the Ford workers probably knew that more than anyone, given the amount of downtime they've had, given the uncertainty, the media speculation of workplace closures and layoffs.''
 Stacey Allerton Firth, vice president for human resources at Ford of Canada, declined to offer details ahead of the ratification process. 
 ''I can tell you, though, that some of the actions that we've discussed in these negotiations do involve job reductions,'' Ms. Firth said. ''We're going to do everything we can to minimize the impact of those reductions.''
 In a sign of Ford's steep sales challenges, the two sides negotiated new enticements to encourage Ford workers to buy their own products, including an increase of 2,000 Canadian dollars in their employee discounts. A trust fund is being set up to provide workers who buy Ford vehicles a discount of 1,000 Canadian dollars on their car insurance. 
 The Ford agreement is the first reached by the Canadian union in its 2005 negotiations. As is traditional, the first deal will be used as a framework for agreements that will be negotiated later this month with General Motors and DaimlerChrysler. 
 In Oakville, Ontario, site of a Ford plant that assembles Ford Freestar and Mercury Monterey minivans, workers did not need any reminders of the perilous state of their jobs. Immediately behind their factory, weeds are already consuming the parking lots of a Ford pickup truck plant that closed 14 months ago. 
 Sagging sales of the Freestar have meant that two groups of workers share a single shift. Each alternates two weeks of work with two weeks of unemployment benefits.
 ''This is not a contract about big wage gains,'' said Jim Forbes, an assembly worker for more than a decade, speaking Monday just ahead of the announcement of an agreement. He said he was not expecting much as he fiddled with a portable radio at the end of his shift in the hopes of finding some details. Mr. Forbes shifted over to the minivan line from the truck plant when it closed. 
 ''The big issue is to make sure that people affected by plant closings are looked after,'' he said. 
 Tracy Duerden, who has been on the Oakville assembly line for nine and a half years, had similarly low expectations. ''We anticipated that we weren't gaining or losing anything,'' she said. ''We're O.K. with that as long as we keep our jobs.''

HEADLINE: Meet The Fakers

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF. 
E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The biggest gathering of leaders in history unfolds this week at the United Nations, as they preen and boast about how much they're helping the world's poor. In short, it may be the greatest assembly in history -- of hypocrites.
 The fact is that with just a few exceptions, the presidents and prime ministers coming to the U.N. summit are doing a disgraceful job in helping the poor. That's one reason the world's richest 500 individuals have the same income as the world's poorest 416 million people. 
We Americans set a dreadful example as hosts to the summit. President Bush has been trying to wriggle away from his 2002 endorsement of the principle that rich countries should try to provide 70 cents in official development assistance for every $100 in national income. (Mr. Bush has sharply increased foreign aid from the Clinton years, but it still stood at only 16 cents in 2004 for each $100 of national income.)
 The Bush administration also tried to change summit documents to downplay references to the millennium development goals of overcoming poverty. Fortunately, the Bush administration backed off and now grudgingly joins the international consensus against infant mortality. 
 It's common to hear abroad scathing criticisms of U.S. stinginess, much of it deserved. But Japan is also a cheapskate, giving only a hair more than the U.S., and Italy gives even less.
 The new Human Development Report 2005, recently issued by the U.N. Development Program, is blessedly undiplomatic in its willingness to point figures -- at just about everybody. It notes that the U.S. and other rich countries seem unwilling to provide a total of $7 billion annually for the next decade to provide 2.6 billion people with access to clean drinking water. That investment would save 4,000 lives a day, and the cost is less than Europeans spend on perfume -- or than Americans spend on cosmetic surgery.
 Meanwhile, the report adds, AIDS kills three million people a year and devastates countries like nothing since the Black Death in the 14th century. Yet annual world spending to fight AIDS amounts to three days of military expenditures.
 This U.N. summit is meant to review the millennium development goals, such as cutting child deaths around the world by two-thirds by 2015. All the goals, adopted with great fanfare five years ago, are feasible, and some countries -- from Bangladesh to Indonesia, Brazil to Mongolia -- are on track to meet them. Hats off to them. But most of the world appears likely to miss the goals.
 Two countries that should be the leaders of the developing world, China and India, are both off track and should be ashamed of their records. In India, among children 1 to 5, girls are 50 percent more likely to die than boys, meaning that each year 130,000 Indian girls are discriminated to death.
 Bangladesh has now overtaken India in improving child mortality, and Vietnam has overtaken China. If India had matched Bangladesh's rate of reduction in child mortality over the last decade, according to the U.N.D.P., it would have saved 732,000 children's lives this year.
 Likewise, China has largely ignored its poor interior, so it still loses 730,000 children each year. China has also taken diplomatic positions that hurt the world's most vulnerable populations, by supporting Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe and by implicitly endorsing Sudan's genocide just as it once endorsed Pol Pot's.
 And African leaders? Perhaps this is naive, but it strikes me as racist for them to have complained about brutal white rule in South Africa or Zimbabwe while excusing black rule that is even more brutal.
 Readers often ask if I find it depressing to visit African slums or mud-brick villages. On the contrary, it's exhilarating to see how little it takes to make a difference. Ancient scourges like river blindness and leprosy are being controlled, and a clever initiative by Bill Gates and others to promote vaccinations (the Global Alliance for Vaccinations and Immunization) saved more than one million lives just between 2001 and 2004. 
 That makes it maddening to see leaders posturing for the cameras at the U.N. while, as the U.N.D.P. report notes, ''the promise to the world's poor is being broken.'' The report adds that the gap between the current trendline on child mortality and the one the leaders committed themselves to amounts to 41 million children dying before their fifth birthday over the next decade.
 Rather than toasting themselves, these leaders should apologize for this continuing holocaust.

HEADLINE: Mayoral Hopefuls Traverse New York in Primary Race

BYLINE: By PATRICK D. HEALY and DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
The four Democratic mayoral candidates aggressively courted voters yesterday on the eve of today's primary, with Fernando Ferrer making an appeal to black and Hispanic New Yorkers in hopes of winning the primary and avoiding a runoff, while the three others tried to energize their core supporters to vote in a race where turnout is the big unknown.
 Behind the scenes, meanwhile, there was 11th-hour strategizing in the four camps as they prepared for victory and defeat today. Advisers to Representative Anthony D. Weiner, who in polls has been gaining ground on Mr. Ferrer, were moving to use more volunteers in parts of Brooklyn, where they believe he could come in first, and Queens, where Mr. Weiner's message of aiding the middle class has apparently been having success. 
Mr. Weiner's aides were also examining ways they might coax endorsements from the two other candidates, C. Virginia Fields and Gifford Miller, in the case of a Ferrer-Weiner runoff. Mr. Miller, the City Council speaker, has dozens of major endorsements, including those of the Brooklyn and Queens Democratic organizations, which Mr. Weiner would also like to pick off quickly.
 Mr. Ferrer displayed his own political muscle yesterday during an early-morning stop at the Jamaica Center subway station in Queens, where he greeted riders along with the state attorney general, Eliot Spitzer; City Comptroller William C. Thompson; and the Rev. Al Sharpton, who endorsed him on Sunday after months of flirting with sitting out the primary.
 Despite Mr. Ferrer's carefully calibrated message about representing all New Yorkers, not only fellow members of minorities, Mr. Sharpton was direct in his appeal to black and Latino New Yorkers.
 ''We have to come out and win the primary and then have a candidate that can unite the party to compete with Mr. Bloomberg,'' Mr. Sharpton said. ''You cannot have a coalition in the Democratic Party without the people of color in this city represented.''
 Mr. Sharpton called for black voters to unite behind Mr. Ferrer despite his controversial remark that the 1999 fatal police shooting of Amadou Diallo was not a crime.
 ''All of us have blundered and made mistakes,'' Mr. Sharpton said. Referring to the city's first black mayor, he added: ''When Dave Dinkins ran, he made a mistake with the Latino community. We asked them to keep moving. Now Mr. Ferrer has said to us that 'I said something careless.'''
 Mr. Sharpton also stepped up his criticism of Mr. Weiner for voting in Congress to authorize the war in Iraq. In response to Mr. Weiner's statement that his vote was based on poor information due to President Bush's ''lies,'' Mr. Sharpton said he was ''more confident with who was not fooled.''
 Many white voters have been wary of Mr. Sharpton for years, especially his history of focusing on racial divisions in times of crisis. Mr. Weiner, who wants many of these white voters to back him today, was nevertheless emphatic that he would not exploit racial suspicions for the sake of votes.
 ''I'm absolutely committed to the idea that I would rather lose this election than have any divisions come from it,'' Mr. Weiner said after a small but energetic rally in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn. ''We're going to unify this party around an economic theme that says, all hard-working New Yorkers are going to have a voice, and that voice is in the Democratic Party.''
 Asked explicitly whether a Ferrer-Weiner runoff would roil the electorate on racial lines, Mr. Weiner's tone hardened notably. ''No -- campaign 2005 will be marked by a unified Democratic Party,'' he said.
 For his part, Mr. Ferrer, who traveled from southeast Queens to the west Bronx to the tip end of Manhattan, sounded hopeful that he might get enough votes to win the primary without a runoff, but had none of the uncharacteristic bravado he displayed toward the end of last week.
 ''I'm hopeful that everyone who supports my candidacy can help push me there; I know they can,'' he said.
 Two new polls yesterday showed Mr. Ferrer capturing 32 to 35 percent of the vote today, while he needs 40 percent to avoid a runoff on Sept. 27 with the next highest vote-getter. Mr. Weiner held second place solidly in both polls, with Ms. Fields and Mr. Miller well behind.
 Although Mr. Ferrer has appeared to lack momentum in recent polls, something was visible during his stop yesterday at Monroe College in the Bronx, where Mr. Ferrer reached as near a fever-pitch as he had throughout the campaign.
 ''What we're fighting over is not a few votes or a few poll points; we're fighting over a vision of New York,'' Mr. Ferrer told a cheering, screaming audience of students and faculty members. ''The power to do that is in your hands, in your hands!'' he yelled, holding his arms aloft as the crowd roared its approval.
 Ms. Fields made 12 campaign stops and radio interviews in about 12 hours yesterday, including a breakfast fund-raiser where supporters played down the significance of polls showing her in third place, and of Mr. Sharpton's call for black voters to support Mr. Ferrer.
 ''Have any of you been polled?'' Percy E. Sutton, a former Manhattan borough president, asked supporters.
 Yet Ms. Fields also sounded like a candidate who was prepared for the voting to begin, come what may.
 ''You can't pull that lever for them -- you just feel helpless,'' she said, adding, ''You walk around and you feel like hey, you know, you've done it, and I believe that we have done it.''
 Mr. Miller, meanwhile, made at least 10 stops during a long day that took him to all five boroughs, starting at 6:30 a.m. by greeting commuters on the Staten Island ferry.
 Despite the opinion polls, Mr. Miller remained resolutely upbeat in public yesterday. In private, however, some of his advisers said discouragement was setting in, and that even their game plan for turning out voters was not enough to double Mr. Miller's poll ratings and vault him into a runoff.
 Reggie Johnson, a spokesman for Mr. Miller, tried to sound as many notes of optimism as he could during an interview yesterday. When pressed, Mr. Miller said it was not time to give up.
 ''You never know until people vote,'' Mr. Miller said. ''It's discouraging to see the polls where they are. But we're still holding out hope.''

HEADLINE: Senate Decides to Vote on Rejection of Mercury-Emission Rules

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 12 

 BODY:
The Senate agreed Monday to vote on a resolution challenging new rules limiting mercury emissions from power plants. 
 The Bush administration said that the rules, completed by the Environmental Protection Agency in March, would eventually cut mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants by 70 percent without driving up energy costs and that repealing the rules would delay the reduction of such emissions.
Environmental and health groups have demanded swifter and tougher measures to reduce emissions. 
 By repealing the rules, the Senate would compel the E.P.A. to rewrite them. The revisions would be in line with Clean Air Act standards requiring the use of the best available technology to reduce mercury emissions.
 The Senate vote on Tuesday is expected to be close, but the Republican-dominated House is unlikely to act on a resolution, which President Bush has said he opposes. 
 Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, and Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, introduced the resolution through a little-used 1996 law that allows Congress to challenge agency rules with a guaranteed floor vote. The law has been successfully invoked only once, when Congress in 2001 repealed Clinton administration workplace ergonomics regulations.
 Senator Collins said that if the rules stand ''power plants will be free to continue spewing unlimited amounts of toxic mercury into our air until the year 2018.''
 But supporters of the E.P.A. rules said that repealing the administration approach could have a devastating impact on the economy, forcing power plants to abandon coal for natural gas and driving up natural-gas prices. They contended it would cost $358 billion to achieve the 90 percent reduction in three years, as opposed to a cost of $2 billion under the Bush administration plan.
 ''It just can't be justified from a cost-benefit point of view,'' said Senator George V. Voinovich, Republican of Ohio.
 A federal appeals court last month rejected a suit brought by environmental and health groups and 14 states seeking to force the E.P.A. to stop implementing the new rules.

HEADLINE: Mexico Builds Trade Ties With China

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Sept. 12 

 BODY:
President Hu Jintao of China wooed Mexican leaders on Monday during a state visit, trying to smooth out the often prickly relationship between the two countries as part of a larger campaign to expand China's influence in Latin America.
 In the afternoon, Mr. Hu and President Vicente Fox signed several minor agreements with great fanfare, among them one providing mutual tax limits on companies doing business in both countries and another that will allow Mexico to export grapes to China in return for importing Chinese pears.
The countries also agreed on a framework for negotiating future accords that eventually may allow Chinese companies to mine iron and other minerals in Mexico. In recent years, China has been scouring Latin America for iron and oil to feed its roaring economy. 
 But underneath these shows of cooperation lies an ugly economic street fight over the United States market, analysts say. Chinese companies have battered Mexico's manufacturers and farmers in recent years, and many here see China threatening to replace Mexico as the main supplier of light manufactured goods. Last year, China knocked Mexico out of the No. 2 spot on the list of importers to the United States. 
 And Mexico itself is flooded with Chinese products, both legal and contraband, from chili peppers to blue jeans to electronics. Last year, Mexico imported $31 in goods from China for every dollar's worth it sent there, according to trade experts here, and that does not include the thriving market in smuggled Chinese goods. 
 ''The real relationship between the People's Republic of China and Mexico is very tense,'' said Enrique Dussel Peters, an expert on Mexican-Chinese trade at the Autonomous University of Mexico. ''This ratio of 31 to 1, which is only going to grow in the short run, is not only a social problem but could become a political problem.''
 In a speech after a signing ceremony, Mr. Fox made it clear he had spoken with Mr. Hu about both the yawning trade deficit and the dumping of contraband Chinese goods. 
 ''Today we heard from President Hu his enthusiasm, his help, his support in closing the commercial gap,'' Mr. Fox said, looking over at Mr. Hu. ''We touched on the subject of contraband and President Hu offered to help with this area.''
 For his part, Mr. Hu kept his remarks short and diplomatic, saying only that he looked forward to seeing more Mexican products in the Chinese market. Later in the day, he visited the Mexican Supreme Court and then the Senate, where he got stuck in a broken elevator for 15 minutes. 
 Mr. Hu's visit seems part of a broader effort to secure future sources of oil, iron ore, aluminum, timber and other commodities throughout Latin America and Canada, despite the United States' longtime hegemony in the region. Under his watch, China has sewn up deals for Chinese companies to develop oil fields and mines and to purchase commodities in Brazil, Venezuela, Chile, Cuba, Bolivia and Argentina.
 Mexico is different. The Constitution bans foreign investment in Petroleos Mexicanos, the state-owned oil monopoly, and the country lacks large reserves of iron and bauxite, analysts say. 
 Julian Ventura, the Mexican director general for Asian affairs, said oil exploration did not even come up Monday. And the mining agreement is only a framework for future deals, not a binding contract, he said. 
 Still, Mr. Ventura said the agreements signed Monday were intended to begin diminishing the trade gap. One of the most important agreements, Mr. Ventura said, will establish direct flights and allow large group tours to begin coming to Mexico from China, a potentially rich source of foreign exchange. ''China is a country that has firmly arrived here in the international economy with an unprecedented impact and volume,'' Mr. Ventura said. ''And what we are looking to do is to see this reality from the perspective of opportunities and not from the perspective of a threat.''

HEADLINE: Tax Bases Shattered, Gulf Region Faces Debt Crisis 

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE; Sewell Chan contributed reporting from Baton Rouge, La., for this article.

 BODY:
By destroying houses, businesses and peoples' lives, Hurricane Katrina also destroyed the tax base of the gulf region. Without homes, New Orleans cannot collect property taxes. Without tourists, it cannot collect hotel taxes. And without restaurants and stores, it cannot collect sales taxes. 
 And with so much in the gulf region shattered, the taxes and other revenue streams that once stood behind its municipal bonds are no longer there.
As a result, state treasurers and local financial officials from Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama have concluded that they will need federal aid to help pay billions of dollars in debt as well as finance the area's reconstruction. 
 So far, they have no formal plan, said John Kennedy, Louisiana's treasurer, but they are considering proposals for the federal government to make payments on existing bonds and cover short-term municipal operating costs. In addition, they are talking about issuing recovery bonds, similar to the $8 billion tax-exempt Liberty Bond program enacted by Congress after 9/11 -- only on a far larger scale. 
 ''We are expecting, hoping and will be asking for federal assistance,'' Mr. Kennedy said. ''We are trying to determine what kind of federal relief we can expect. The municipalities that cannot make their bond payments are going to need help. We are hoping for substantial federal aid.''
 Last week, the National Association of Bond Lawyers wrote to the White House to propose a Hurricane Katrina Indebtedness Guarantee and Financing Act. That measure would provide cash advances to municipalities unable to pay bondholders and would offer federal guarantees on future debt. These advances would have to be paid back in 10 years. The group also called for creation of a Liberty Bond-type program. 
 ''When a city such as New Orleans may be shut down for nine months,'' said Monty G. Humble, chairman of the association, ''you know that access to capital may be an issue. These areas are so devastated.'' 
 State economic development officials from the region are heading to Washington today with a $52 billion plan involving tax credits and other development incentives to keep businesses from leaving. They are hoping that $30 billion will be directed to Louisiana, $15 billion to Mississippi and $7 billion to Alabama.
 In the annals of municipal finance -- with its share of bankruptcies, defaults and financially distressed cities -- nothing comes close. Previous hurricanes, floods and earthquakes have had a more limited impact, affecting mainly residential areas and not damaging the business underpinnings of a city the size of New Orleans and the coastal areas around Biloxi and Gulfport, Miss.
 ''We have nothing to compare this to,'' said Dwight Denison, associate professor of public finance at the University of Kentucky. ''You've never wiped out an entire tax base. And when you wipe out a tax base, you have nothing to tax.''
 Municipal bond insurers say their exposure in the region is $14 billion. Standard & Poor's, one of the main bond rating agencies, has put $8 billion in municipal debt from the area on its Creditwatch list, signaling possible trouble ahead, while Moody's Investor Service put $9.4 billion in debt on its Watchlist. 
 Already, late last week, a $36.3 million bond deal for the Orleans Levee District was canceled because the bond insurer, MBIA Inc., backed out.
 ''In the past you got a shock, like 9/11 or a natural disaster, and it can impair an issuer for a while, but they recover relatively quickly,'' said Donald Lipkin, a managing director in the municipal finance department at Bear Stearns, a New York brokerage firm. ''Here, because of the level of impairment, there is a good chance some credits may not pay on a timely basis.'' 
 Municipal issuers in the affected areas say bondholders have nothing to worry about -- for the moment. Enough money has been set aside, in nearly all cases, to cover debt service payments at least through the end of the year. The looming question is what happens when the money runs out. 
 New Orleans has over $2 billion in municipal bonds outstanding, from $650 million in general obligation bonds backed by property taxes to bonds used to pay for work on schools, levees, sewers, and transportation. There are more bonds for hospitals, schools and other public but nongovernmental entities no longer functioning. 
 Even in the best of times, New Orleans had it tough. Its bonds are rated just above junk and some entities have borrowed just to keep going. The Orleans Parish School Board, for instance, recently sold $50 million in revenue anticipation notes as it ran short of cash. The school district already had $600 million in bonds outstanding. 
 The city also has $500 million in debt for the New Orleans Ernest N. Morial Convention Center, where many sought refuge after the hurricane. That debt is backed by a share of hotel, food and sightseeing tour taxes. 
 ''For the city, all the long-term debt is fine for a year,'' said Peter Kessenich, managing director at Public Financial Management in Atlanta, the city's bond adviser. ''Beyond that, you will be sending tax bills to people who don't live there or to houses that are not worth much.''
 After 9/11, the city of New York issued $1 billion in one-year notes to cover immediate financial needs. But these were backed by personal income and sales taxes from a New York City still standing and an economy still functioning. Investors gobbled up those bonds, in part as a show of support.
 Liberty Bonds, issued a year later, allowed businesses in lower Manhattan to borrow in the municipal market, where interest rates are lower than for corporate debt. 
 Mr. Kennedy, the Louisiana treasurer, insisted that his state had sufficient reserves and taxing power to meet all current and future state-level debt obligations and that bankruptcy was not an option. ''It's not even in the realm of possibility,'' he said. 
 Even so, Mr. Kennedy acknowledged that many local municipalities might not make their debt payments once their reserves run out. As soon as he was able to return to his office after the hurricane, Mr. Kennedy started weekly meetings of local officials, bond underwriters, lawyers and trustees from the affected areas to discuss the many issues.
 More than 25 percent of the personal income taxes in the state come from the New Orleans area, and much of that income will no longer exist. As a result, the state government could be hard pressed to help cash-strapped municipalities.
 Mr. Kennedy is also holding weekly conference calls with bond rating agencies and institutional investors to keep them abreast of the situation. 
 In Mississippi, where Gulfport and Biloxi have been hit hard, the state treasurer, Tate Reeves, has been holding similar meetings and is sending out a positive message. 
 ''We don't anticipate any interruption in debt-service payments,'' Mr. Reeves said. ''For some local issuers, making debt-service payments will be a challenge, no question. But I anticipate no defaults from public issuers in Mississippi.'' Both Standard and Poor's and Moody's have put $3 billion of Mississippi debt on watch lists. 
 Mr. Reeves said he thought his state would bounce back faster than many might expect, pointing out that power was already being restored in the coastal areas. 
 Defaults in the municipal finance market are rare and bankruptcies even rarer. Even during the Depression, 4,770 issues defaulted on $2.85 billion in debt, but most eventually paid it back. In 1994, Orange County in California went into bankruptcy (and paid back all the debt after a two-year delay) and in the late 1970's, Cleveland filed for bankruptcy. 
 Bond insurers have never had to make debt-service payments because of a natural disaster, but that may change. Drawing on insurance is a last step, and municipalities must pay insurers back for any money used. 
 ''Bond insurers will definitely have to step up to the table,'' said Bart Hildreth, a public finance professor at Wichita State University. 
 It is also almost unheard of for the federal government to be asked to pick up debt-service costs for local municipalities. In the 1975 fiscal crisis in New York City, Washington guaranteed bonds issued by the city, but never had to pay anything and actually made money on the deal.
 At the moment, most attention is on the immediate crisis. But the White House is aware of the coming financial challenge.
 ''As we move forward, we will be taking a closer look at the broader needs,'' said Scott Milburn, a spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget. ''Municipal bonds falls into that category.''

HEADLINE: Just Plain Folk? I'm Far Plainer Than You Are 

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN

 BODY:
IF you really want to hear about it, to echo Holden Caulfield, I was born in the South Bronx to a hard-working immigrant family, my father having begun his life in America driving a horse-drawn laundry wagon.
 So what did that make the family back then? Lower-middle-class? Or was it middle-lower-class? Hard to figure out.
Hang on, hang on. Why should you care? What does any of this have to do with New York in 2005? 
 Nothing. Nothing at all.
 Sorry about the irrelevant journey through time. It comes from listening to the Democrats running for mayor and their David Copperfield shtick. (We're talking Dickens here, not magicians.) After a while, a guy can pick up some of their habits.
 Given a chance to talk about themselves in debates and television commercials, most of the candidates have emphasized their up-from-the-bottom roots, as if that alone were almost reason to hand them the keys to the city for the next four years.
 Vote for me, one of them says. I grew up middle-class in Brooklyn, and my mother was a schoolteacher.
 No, me, another says. I lived in a five-story Bronx walk-up, raised by my mother and grandmother.
 Try this, a third says. I not only grew up in a working-class family, but I also did it in the segregated South.
 The only candidate who has not played this game is Gifford Miller, the City Council speaker. But that is no doubt because he figured there is little political profit in talking about a fairly privileged childhood on the Upper East Side.
 Even he, however, has his just-plain-folk yearnings. He used to be known as A. Gifford Miller. Several years ago, he dropped the A, which stands for Alan. ''A. Gifford Miller'' was apparently deemed too hoity-toity for someone about to run for mayor.
 So why not call himself Alan Miller or, better yet, Al Miller? Good old Al.
 Maybe that sounded a tad too plain.
 Of course, these Democrats did not invent the art of turning one's childhood into a credential for high office. Former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani talked all the time about growing up in Brooklyn. But that was accurate only if we assume that the young Rudy reached full maturity when he was 7, in 1951. That was when his family, like many Brooklynites of that era, high-tailed it to Long Island.
 Obviously, one reason the Democrats emphasize their modest origins is to contrast themselves with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, often referred to as Billionaire Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, as if ''billionaire mayor'' were his formal title. The recurring Democratic mantra is that a super-rich mayor is by definition out of touch with ordinary people, never mind that he regularly rides the subway -- unlike this bunch of Democrats.
 Always left unsaid in this appeal to class solidarity is that Mr. Bloomberg was not born a billionaire or even a millionaire. He grew up near Boston in circumstances not unlike those of his Democratic rivals. His father was a bookkeeper at a dairy.
 The Democrats hope that many voters instinctively dislike an extremely wealthy politician who made it on his own. This is not a wild-eyed notion. Voters have rarely had a problem with politicians born to wealth, with names like Kennedy, Rockefeller and Bush. But a self-made multibillionaire is arguably a reproach to all of us still working on the first billion.
 IF voter resentment does exist, how deep could it go in this case? Polls show Mr. Bloomberg, the free-spending Republican, thrashing any candidate who emerges intact from today's primary. All that childhood poor-mouthing has not done these Democrats much demonstrable good.
 Would anything be different if they were rich themselves? If they had Mr. Bloomberg's money, they were asked during a debate last month, would they spend any of it on their campaigns as he does? Emphatically, all four said no.
 It seemed at first blush to be a Pinocchio moment. But maybe they were speaking plainly: They don't want to spend their own money furthering their ambitions.
 No, they would rather spend your money -- you taxpayers who make government matching funds possible, you real estate developers who finance campaigns in the hope of currying favor.
 That is how political life has long run in New York. Perhaps voters, regardless of economic class, are beginning to grow tired of it. And perhaps it is a reason, if the polls are right, that New Yorkers will see something in November that once seemed unimaginable: a fourth straight Republican victory for mayor.

HEADLINE: 45 Bodies Found in a New Orleans Hospital

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON; Reporting for this article was contributed by Sewell Chan in Baton Rouge, La.; Michael Luo and William Yardley in New Orleans; and Campbell Robertson in Gulfport, Miss.

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Sept. 12 

 BODY:
The bodies of 45 people have been found in a flooded uptown hospital here, officials said Monday, sharply increasing the death toll from Hurricane Katrina and raising new questions about the breakdown of the evacuation system as the disaster unfolded.
 Officials at the hospital, the Memorial Medical Center, said at least some of the victims died while waiting to be removed in the four days after the hurricane struck, with the electricity out and temperatures exceeding 100 degrees.
Steven L. Campanini, a spokesman for the hospital's owner, Tenet Healthcare, said the dead included patients who died awaiting evacuation as well as people who died before the hurricane struck and whose bodies were in the hospital morgue. 
 Mr. Campanini said the dead might have also included evacuees from other hospitals and the surrounding neighborhood who gathered at Memorial while waiting to evacuate the city. 
 Repercussions from the storm continued to echo in Washington, where the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Michael D. Brown, a walking symbol to many people here of government failure in the crisis, resigned. Mr. Brown was relieved of his role in the day-to-day disaster operations here on Friday. [Page A26.] 
 President Bush, meanwhile, toured the ghostly streets of the city standing in the back of an open-air truck flanked by the mayor of New Orleans and the governor of Louisiana, who have been sharply critical of the federal performance. 
 In Baton Rouge, 1,000 people from the devastated St. Bernard Parish, just east of New Orleans, crowded the State Capitol and were told that memories of their community might be all they have left. 
 Flights were set to resume at the Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport, and city officials said they were creating a new command center downtown at a closed hotel.
 Mr. Bush's appearance with Mayor C. Ray Nagin of New Orleans and Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco, both Democrats, suggested that at least some of the bitterness over the response to the disaster had lifted.
 On Mr. Bush's most recent visit to the stricken area, on Sept. 5, Ms. Blanco learned that he was making the trip from news reports. 
 The president, in a brief question and answer session with reporters after his tour on Monday, said that government coordination in rebuilding the city and the region was paramount and that local vision should determine the direction of the reconstruction. ''It's very important for the folks in New Orleans to understand that, at least as far as I'm concerned, this great city has got ample talent and ample genius to set the strategy and set the vision,'' Mr. Bush said after his 40-minute tour. ''Our role at the federal government is, you know, obviously within the law, to help them realize that vision. And that's what I wanted to assure the mayor.''
 Mr. Bush also returned to accusations that racial discrimination was involved in government's response to the hurricane, saying ''the storm didn't discriminate'' and neither did the rescuers. 
 Mr. Nagin and Ms. Blanco have said federal delays in sending aid had compounded the damage of the storm and heightened the anarchy in the days after the storm, when tens of thousands of people were trapped for days at sites like the Convention Center and the Superdome without food or water.
 Mr. Nagin said in a radio interview Monday, when asked about his meeting with the president, ''If anything, he told me he kind of appreciated my frankness and my bluntness.''
 The news that 45 bodies had been found at Memorial was also a reminder of how much else, in the physical structure and in the human toll, might yet remain unknown.
 On Monday, the authorities elevated the statewide death toll from Hurricane Katrina to 279; of those, 242 were from the New Orleans metropolitan region. In Mississippi, Gov. Haley Barbour said the toll there was 218. 
 In Baton Rouge, there were more reminders of the thousands of people who may have no community to return to at all.
 More than 1,000 displaced residents from St. Bernard Parish crowded the State Capitol to learn about the state of their devastated houses. No one has been permitted to re-enter the area to retrieve belongings or examine their houses. News of the meeting traveled by word of mouth and Web sites, and people lined up for blocks outside the Art Deco Capitol, where Gov. Huey P. Long was assassinated in 1935. Some drove from Houston. 
 Local officials did not try to hide the bad news.
 ''You will not recognize St. Bernard Parish,'' the parish president, Henry J. Rodriguez Jr., told hundreds of residents in the marble foyer of the Capitol. ''All you will have left of St. Bernard Parish is your memories.''
 Mr. Bush also saw the devastation first-hand on his tour of New Orleans. His tour passed by smashed cars, tree branches and rubble.
 For most of the ride, Ms. Blanco, Mr. Bush and Mr. Nagin stood in a military truck and had to duck under low wires and branches. At one point, Vice Adm. Thad W. Allen of the Coast Guard, who succeeded Mr. Brown last week as head of hurricane relief, removed his Coast Guard cap to shield Mr. Bush from a wire. 
 City officials said they had moved most of the makeshift emergency operations command center that they had set up at City Hall since the storm arrived across the street to a battered Hyatt hotel, where power has been restored and Mayor Nagin keeps a suite.
 In Ballroom E on the third floor of the hotel, 100 computer stations were set up at pods of circular tables to handle 24-hour work by groups like the New Orleans police, 82nd Airborne Division of the Army, the Coast Guard, National Guard and public health officials.
 Edward Minyard, a contractor with Unisys who is in charge of setting up the center, said the operation was very likely to grow to as many as 500 positions, meaning as many as 1,500 people working in shifts around the clock. 
 In Harrison County, Miss., in the Gulfport-Biloxi region, a list of 600 missing persons was distributed by the coroner's office, though authorities emphasized that the people on the list were not necessarily missing. The names are of people who have been sought by family members. 
 ''We have rescued everybody that we think could possibly be rescued,'' said Joe Spraggins, the head of emergency management for the county. 
 Gulfport-Biloxi International Airport, which began running commercial flights at the end of last week, expects to return to its regular flight schedule in two weeks, Colonel Spraggins said. 
 Delta, Northwest and AirTran Airlines plan to begin operating limited schedules on Tuesday, he said. Northwest said it would resume scheduled commercial service to the New Orleans airport on Wednesday, with its first inbound flight in 10 days scheduled to arrive from Memphis at 10:44 a.m. Repairs began on Monday on the Twin Span Bridge on Interstate 10, connecting New Orleans and Slidell. Within 45 days, the eastbound span is to be repaired, providing one lane of traffic in each direction.

HEADLINE: U.S. May Start Pulling Out of Afghanistan Next Spring

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT and DAVID S. CLOUD; Eric Schmitt reported from Kabul for this article and David S. Cloud from Berlin. Judy Dempsey contributed reporting from Berlin.

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan, Sept. 13 

 BODY:
Senior Pentagon and military officials are discussing a proposal to cut American troop levels in Afghanistan next spring, perhaps by as much as 20 percent, the largest withdrawal since the Taliban were ousted in late 2001. 
 The troops would be replaced by NATO soldiers, who now oversee security and reconstruction missions in northern and western Afghanistan and are to take over an American command in the south next spring. American troops have been taxed by lengthy deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan, and Pentagon officials have sought to replace them with indigenous or allied troops.
But Germany, supported by Britain, France and other European allies, said Tuesday at a meeting of defense ministers in Berlin that it strongly opposed any American-backed restructuring of the NATO command structure that could lead to having alliance troops become involved in counterinsurgency. 
 Because those operations represent a large part of American troop activity in the south, it is not clear whether the reductions can go forward. In the past few months, violence has surged in the south, with Taliban forces conducting a campaign of assassinations and intimidation ahead of elections on Sunday. 
 Military officials emphasize that any reductions in the nearly American 20,000 troops in Afghanistan hinge on resolution of the details with NATO, successful parliamentary and provincial elections and stable security. 
 ''It makes sense that as NATO forces go in, and they're more in numbers, that we could drop some of the U.S. requirements somewhat,'' Gen. John P. Abizaid, the head the United States Central Command, said in an interview here on Tuesday. 
 General Abizaid declined to give an exact number of potential troop cuts. But another senior officer, who spoke anonymously because the decision is not final, said the Pentagon could reduce force levels by as much as 20 percent, or about 4,000 troops. 
 American officials were quick to note that the United States would still have the largest number of foreign soldiers in Afghanistan, and would remain committed to ensuring political, economic and security gains in the country.
 At the meeting in Berlin, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said he would urge the alliance to expand its role in Afghanistan beyond its security and peacekeeping duties. 
 Although Mr. Rumsfeld emphasized that American troops would continue to handle the counterinsurgency mission ''for a time,'' he said NATO should consider deploying troops to the eastern border region, which the United States oversees and where much of the fighting is occurring. He added that ''over time, it would be nice if NATO developed counterterrorism capabilities, which don't exist at the present time.'' 
 But the German defense minister, Peter Struck, said merging NATO's peacekeeping mission with the American combat operation under a single commander would fundamentally change NATO's role in Afghanistan and ''would make the situation for our soldiers doubly dangerous and worsen the current climate in Afghanistan.'' Officials in Britain and France also voiced opposition to the idea. 
 Some American officials played down the dispute, saying that while they were seeking to combine the operations of American and NATO forces, they were not committed to any particular approach, and that a consensus would be worked out.
 To overcome European opposition, the Pentagon is proposing, among other ideas, a joint NATO command structure in which countries willing to contribute troops to counterinsurgency would be under one officer, while allies that want to continue to conduct peacekeeping and other noncombat roles would fall under another. The two contingents would fall under one overall commander.
 Both France and Germany have small special forces involved in combat alongside American troops, but most of the European contribution is to the 11,000 officers in the International Security Assistance Force, which conducts peacekeeping and security duties in Kabul and in the north and west.
 Britain, Canada and the Netherlands have already agreed to take over the NATO command in the south, where American troops have clashed with Taliban, in particular north of Kandahar. But it is unclear if the force in the south will be intended for counterinsurgency. 
 Throughout Afghanistan on Tuesday, the American military continued gearing up for an anticipated spike in insurgent attacks just before the voting. Virtually all American troops will stand by, out of sight, to safeguard some 6,200 polling stations, which will be ringed with Afghan soldiers and police officers. 
 Attacks against American forces are down slightly from a year ago, commanders said, but this year's violence has been deadlier, with assassinations and roadside bombings killing 2 candidates for Parliament and at least 16 others. 
 Sixty-nine American service members have been killed in Afghanistan this year, the deadliest for United States troops since the war in 2001. Some deaths resulted from stepped-up American offensives in areas sympathetic to the Taliban. Lt. Col. Gerald J. O'Hara, a military spokesman, said coalition troops had killed about 600 insurgents since March. 
 Maj. Gen. Jason K. Kamiya, the American commander of daily tactical operations in Afghanistan, gave details on a new plan to outfit Afghan soldiers to fight through the winter, when both insurgent and allied troops usually curtail operations because heavy snows make travel through mountainous regions extremely difficult. 
 General Kamiya said in an interview that he wanted to keep the pressure on Taliban fighters as they leave their summer fighting positions for sanctuary in Pakistan or deep in the Afghan interior. 
 He said he was also planning to spend $68 million in reconstruction projects by next spring in an effort to show the Afghan people that combat operations were pushing ahead along with improvements to their villages and towns. 
 In a similar effort to impress villagers in the Taliban heartland, Army engineers and the Agency for International Development recently completed a $35 million, 74-mile road connecting Kandahar to Tarin Kwot, cutting a bone-jarring 11-hour drive to 3 hours.

Pakistanis Seize 21 Militants
 (By The New York Times), PESHAWAR, Pakistan, Sept. 13 -- A top Pakistani military commander here said Tuesday that his forces had arrested 21 militants in its mountainous northwest region, found a remotely piloted spy plane and seized a cache of arms and communications equipment believed to be used in insurgent operations in Afghanistan. 
 The commander, Lt. Gen. Safdar Hussain, in charge of military forces and tribal agencies in the North West Frontier Province, also said his forces had detected an office for recruiting men to fight the government and Americans in Afghanistan.

HEADLINE: Once Home to Ford, Canadian City Is Losing Auto Work

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

DATELINE: WINDSOR, Ontario, Sept. 13 

 BODY:
At the foot of Drouillard Road, the main street of what was once the separate municipality of Ford City, a plaque recalls a bitter and often violent 1945 strike at the nearby Ford complex that ultimately changed labor laws and significantly increased the power of unions in Canada.
 This week, the Canadian Auto Workers gave tentative acceptance to a contract that will allow the Ford Motor Company of Canada to eliminate about 1,100 jobs in exchange for little more than slight improvements in severance, and minimal wage and benefit increases for the remaining employees. That says much about how the union's power has changed since then.
 And while Ford and other automakers will remain significant employers in Windsor, which sits just across a river from Detroit, the additional job losses and the closing of a Ford foundry are yet another sign that Canada's automotive capital is not sharing in the automotive industry upswing that has made Ontario a bigger producer of motor vehicles than Michigan. 
 ''People around here are quite anxious about this and with good reason,'' said Alan Hall, director of the University of Windsor's labor studies department. ''The long and short of it is that these jobs are gone and the contribution they make to the economy is gone. It's nice to soften the impact of that. But the fact is that they will have far less employment.''
 While DaimlerChrysler Canada long ago eclipsed Ford in terms of employment in this city of about 209,000, it is a sign of the company role in Windsor that locals inevitably refer to it as Ford's. But it has been a relationship with some significant strains.
 ''The relationship has been good but we've suffered a lot of pain over the years,'' said Alex Keeney, a former president of the C.A.W. local that represents Ford workers in Windsor, who is now a national representative for the union.
 Many elderly Windsor residents still recall with bitterness Ford's decision to move all its Canadian auto assembly operations to a new factory in Oakville, Ontario, in 1953, which cost the city about 6,000 factory jobs. As if to further the insult, the company's Canadian head office left for Toronto a year later.
 The latest low point in the story will be the closing in 2007 or 2008 of the Ford Casting Plant, a 71-year-old foundry spiked with chimneys and tubes that is attached to an 82-year-old factory that turns out engines for large S.U.V.'s and pickup trucks.
 The casting plant has come back from the dead after being closed for three years starting in 1980. But the increasing substitution of its cast iron parts with others made of aluminum alloys in current engines means that even Mr. Keeney has little hope for a second revival.
 The elegant red brick engine plant, which was designed by Henry Ford's favorite architect, Albert Kahn, is in no danger of closing. But under the tentative contract, which union members will vote on this coming weekend, a different engine plant will lose one line. Ford promises a successor, but the union expects that it will add to the 684 jobs that will vanish at the foundry.
 While no final numbers have been determined, it appears that Ford will end up directly employing about 3,500 people in Windsor, apart from workers in an aluminum casting joint venture, a fraction of its peak of 15,000 in 1954.
 But Ford has not been the only disappointment for Windsor. Fifteen hundred jobs were lost in 2003 when DaimlerChrysler decided to import full-size vans from Germany rather than continue to build them at a plant here, which it shut. Toyota and Honda have built all of their Canadian operations several hundred miles west of Windsor, a move Dr. Hall partly attributes to their desire to avoid the city's strong union culture.
 Now even the parts producers, whose growth had offset some of the losses at Ford, Chrysler and a General Motors transmission plant in the city, are looking increasingly to Asian production to reduce costs.
 It is a situation that Dr. Hall said defies easy solutions. Windsor has long talked about diversifying its economy to reduce its automotive dependence. But Dr. Hall has little hope of that bringing real relief.
 ''It's like the effort to cut the dependence Canada generally has on the American market,'' Dr. Hall said. ''Everybody says we have to do it, but it's difficult to see any substantial efforts.''

HEADLINE: Cattlemen's Group Wrangles With Its Former Allies

BYLINE: By JIM ROBBINS

DATELINE: BILLINGS, Mont., Sept. 10 

 BODY:
In a cramped office sandwiched between cattle auction yards and the looming white tanks of an oil refinery is the headquarters of a growing cowboy rebellion against federal trade policies and the large beef-packing companies they once regarded as allies.
 It is the office of the Ranchers-Cattlemen Action Legal Fund, United Stockgrowers of America, or R-Calf USA, an organization of ranchers founded in 1999 that says its membership has doubled to 18,000 in the last year.
The organization has found an ally in Montana's governor, a former rancher who last month called the Agriculture Department ''stooges'' of the meatpacking industry. And it has drawn the ire of a rival beef group and Canadian ranchers by managing to keep the border closed to Canadian cattle for several months this year. 
 Staking its ground against the Bush administration and meatpackers, who depend on a steady supply of cattle, R-Calf contends that the threat of mad cow disease is still too great to allow Canadian cattle into the United States. 
 ''Our competitive advantage is we produce the best beef under the best conditions,'' said Bill Bullard, chief executive of R-Calf. The Department of Agriculture, Mr. Bullard said, was ''attempting to compromise those very health and safety standards'' by allowing the import of Canadian cattle. 
 For years, most cattle producers were part of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, based in Colorado, whose members include large packers and cattle feeding operations. 
 But issues like the North American Free Trade Act, the recent Central America Free Trade Act, mad cow disease and mandatory country of origin labeling have fenced off segments of the industry. Producers have found themselves on the other side of many of these issues from packing houses like IBP and Tyson. 
 ''Anything we've brought forward to help U.S. cattle producers be more competitive, N.C.B.A. has been opposed,'' said Leo McDonnell, the president and founder of R-Calf, who breeds bulls near Columbus, Mont. ''As great as the global market is, we're a dying industry.'' 
 An obituary may be premature, but the number of cattle has fallen, to 104 million this year from 125 million in 1981, and producers declined to 989,000 in 2004 from 1.3 million in 1989, according to Agriculture Department statistics.
 Some industry observers are surprised by the growth of R-Calf. If anything, ranchers are seen as independent types not quick to join organizations. But the group speaks the same language as its members and is narrowly focused on ranchers' concerns. 
 ''R-Calf is run by people who look and talk like cowboys,'' said Mikkel Pates, a reporter for Agweek in Fargo, N.D., who has written about the organization. ''And they are.''
 Ty Thompson, a member of R-Calf with a small feeding operation in Lockwood, Mont., said ranchers liked R-Calf ''because it's a grass-roots organization that they can talk to.''
 This prairie populism comes amid three boom years for cattle producers. After the discovery of mad cow disease in an Alberta cow closed the border to Canadian cattle in 2003, prices in the United States rose to $135 per hundredweight from $95 and have stayed close to the higher figure, even after imports resumed in July. Imports of calves younger than 30 months were supposed to resume in March. But R-Calf, raising legal fees from charity auctions, won a temporary injunction to stop the imports after arguing that the Agriculture Department had not done enough to guard against mad cow disease. 
 The department has argued that the risk of mad cow disease was low enough in young Canadian calves to allow them into the country.
 ''It's science driving the decision, not politics,'' said Ron DeHaven, the administrator for the agency's Animal and Plant Inspection Health Service. ''Science based on what we know about the disease and international standards. It's safer to eat the beef than it is to drive to the store and buy it.''
 A three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit lifted the injunction in July. R-Calf seeks a rehearing by all 11 judges on the court.
 J. Patrick Boyle, president and chief executive of the American Meat Institute, called R-Calf ''isolationist'' and said the trade policies it advocated ultimately hurt everyone in the industry.
 ''It's a shortsighted approach,'' he said. ''Yes, they've enjoyed artificially high cattle prices. But consumers are moving to other protein because our product is at historically high prices.'' 
 Ground beef, he said, had risen to $2.50 a pound from $1.85. As a result, he said, ''the meatpacking industry has lost 10,000 jobs.'' 
 Jay Truitt, vice president for government affairs of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, said R-Calf was wrong about what it advocated. Country-of-origin labeling -- which R-Calf lobbied for and which Congress passed in 2003 -- should be sorted out by the free market, not the government, Mr. Truitt said. And, he added, lowering trade barriers will benefit everyone. 
 Mr. Truitt said his group was also working in behalf of ranchers and understood them. ''I was raised a cattleman, and I wear a pair of boots every day of my life,'' he said.
 Mr. Bullard, R-Calf's chief executive, acknowledges that the closed border has been a boon for American ranchers. ''There's no question our organization has an interest in higher cattle prices,'' he said. But, he added, ''we're healing from long-term depressed prices.''
 The ranchers' rebellion has received support from Gov. Brian Schweitzer of Montana, a Democrat who has cultivated a populist streak. He says the large meatpackers have grown too powerful.
 ''They control not only the market, but the regulatory agencies,'' Mr. Schweitzer said. 
 ''It's a revolving door,'' he said.
 The governor's stance and R-Calf's legal fights have chafed ranchers north of the border. 
 ''They are looking out for themselves, as far as I can see,'' said David Penner, yard foreman at the Grunthal Livestock Auction Mart in Manitoba, referring to R-Calf. ''They are not worried about us or even worried about the U.S. economy with all the packing plants closed down.''
 But Mr. McDonnell, the president of R-Calf, said the organization was not just a group of isolationists. ''We're trying to prevent a collapse of our industry,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Can Hospitals Reopen? It's a Matter of Money

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON

 BODY:
The New Orleans medical system has been devastated by Hurricane Katrina, and no one can say how many hospitals will ever reopen.
 Although some local officials are calling for a central plan, decisions are likely to be based mainly on economic forces -- not necessarily on the city's health care needs. Deregulation at the state and federal level over the last few decades has meant that the main force in the hospital industry now is the invisible hand of the marketplace.
''These are ad hoc decisions,'' said Martin D. Arrick, a bond analyst for Standard & Poor's who follows the nonprofit hospital industry. 
 Of the 16 hospitals in the immediate area of New Orleans, at least 13 were closed because of the storm or concerns about looting, according to the state hospital association. Mr. Arrick said that individual hospitals would decide, based on whether they had the wherewithal to rebuild and on their assumptions about whether there would be enough paying patients. 
 ''I really think the economy drives everything,'' he said. 
 Without electricity and running water, Touro Infirmary was one of those forced to evacuate. Touro administrators, now working from an office building in Baton Rouge, La., more than 75 miles away, hope to tour the hospital this week as power is restored and to start evaluating the damage. There is no question that Touro, a nonprofit Jewish-founded hospital, will reopen, its chief executive, Leslie D. Hirsch, said. 
 But many other New Orleans hospitals have not yet made decisions. These include two for-profit hospitals owned by Tenet Healthcare -- the Lindy Boggs Medical Center and Memorial Medical Center -- both heavily damaged by flooding. Memorial gained attention early this week when 45 bodies were discovered there, some of them patients who died while awaiting transfer. 
 The notion of health care planning has been out of fashion in this country, especially in states like Louisiana, where any health care oversight tends to be an exercise in local politics. Even after a disaster of Katrina's magnitude, many experts say that a coordinated government approach to rebuilding hospitals there is unlikely.
 ''I think Louisiana would be the last place for regional planning,'' said Mark V. Pauly, a health economics professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.
 But some New Orleans hospital officials say it may now be time for a coordinated approach. ''It's not really up to the hospitals to decide what the health care delivery system should be,'' said Donald R. Smithburg, chief executive of Louisiana State University's health care services division, which ran the state's two public hospitals in New Orleans -- Charity and University, which had about 600 beds in total and are situated next to each other. With the water receding, the facilities are now being cleaned up. 
 Rebuilding the city's hospitals, Mr. Smithburg said, will mean ''just about starting from scratch.'' 
 No one knows what a rebuilt New Orleans will look like. And hospital officials say they have no way of forecasting yet how many people will return to the city -- or arrive as new settlers -- let alone predict their health care needs. 
 ''It's going to be interesting to see what the demand for hospitals is,'' said John A. Matessino, chief executive of the Louisiana Hospital Association. He predicted that there might be some form of task force created among the area's hospitals so there is at least some discussion of such issues.
 It is not only a matter of how many people return, experts say, but also whether they have jobs and health insurance. If a large number of people have no insurance or are dependent on public programs like Medicaid to pay for their care, private hospitals may not have enough paying patients to warrant staying open. 
 Until they know the full extent of the damage, hospital officials have no way of estimating how much insurance money may be on the way. The availability of government funds may depend on the type of institution, and New Orleans has a broad variety of public and private, nonprofit and for-profit hospitals. 
 The state's public hospitals, run by the state university system, are likely to get significant amounts of rebuilding money from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, just as the University of California, Los Angeles did after the earthquake in 1994 that damaged its medical center. Charity, one of the state hospitals in New Orleans, was badly in need of renovation even before Hurricane Katrina. 
 Charity in particular is likely to receive government funds because that hospital was ''the face of Katrina,'' said Mark Wietecha, the chairman of Kurt Salmon Associations, a consulting firm that works closely with hospitals.
 But any decisions about how much FEMA money will be available will not be made until the hospitals apply for reconstruction assistance, an agency spokeswoman said. Only government-run or nonprofit hospitals are eligible for this help. 
 Right now, the state university system is trying to make sure that there are enough hospitals in the Baton Rouge area to meet short-term needs. Only then will it address the longer-term issue of public health in New Orleans, Mr. Smithburg, the L.S.U. hospital official, said, adding, ''We don't know what New Orleans is or will be for some time.''
 The three hospitals that were able to remain open throughout the hurricane and its aftermath, according to the Louisiana Hospital Association, were Oschner Clinic Foundation, West Jefferson Medical Center and East Jefferson General. Twenty-two other hospitals affected by the hurricane are operating further from New Orleans. 
 Tenet and HCA, another for-profit company whose hospitals closed in Katrina's aftermath, each said that they had not yet determined whether they would reopen all their facilities. HCA operated Tulane University Hospital and Clinic. Tenet, besides its two downtown hospitals, Lindy Boggs and Memorial, owns two others: Kenner Regional Medical Center and Meadowcrest Hospital. 
 Kenner and Meadowcrest were not damaged, although local officials have talked about temporarily using them for emergency work. Tenet has said that it plans as soon as possible to reopen those two. 
 Stuart Altman, a professor at Brandeis University, who was involved in regional health care planning for the federal government in the 1970's, said he would favor a regional rebuilding approach with any government money shared by all the city's hospitals. 
 ''I would hope that they would move health care from a private service to a public service, regardless of the ownership of the facility,'' Mr. Altman said. 
 Yet even if hospitals receive money from federal agencies and insurers, they are likely to come up short. ''The FEMA money will not cover the replacements,'' Mr. Wietecha, the consultant, said.
 While some hospitals may have the option and choose not to open, others may simply be without the capital to rebuild. 
 ''The lower-rated, smaller players will likely be the most vulnerable,'' said Robert Fuller, founder of Capital Markets Management, a consulting firm that provides financial advice to hospitals. ''It's possible that this could drive affiliations,'' he said, as some weaker hospitals seek survival through mergers. That, of course, assumes wealthier hospitals want to buy them. 
 Even if an individual hospital in New Orleans is reluctant to close, Mr. Pauly, the Wharton professor, said, ''it may be the market will do it for them.''

HEADLINE: The Struggle To Find Life In Ordinary Landscapes

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
The global landscape portrayed in Jem Cohen's visually haunting film ''Chain'' is an industrial park-cum-shopping mall where the same brand names pop up everywhere, be it Florida, Texas, Berlin, Paris or Melbourne. In this profoundly impersonal suburban climate, two lone women, one an eager corporate beaver, the other a semidropout scrounging on the fringes of society, scuttle through their days. As the movie alternates between the women, who have no connection and who never meet, they muse out loud about their solitary lives.
 Tamiko (Miho Nikaido), the eager beaver, is a 31-year-old Japanese businesswoman dispatched to the United States by a troubled steel company that is entering the theme park business. Her assignment is to compile information on American theme parks and relay it to her bosses, who may call their venture the Floating World. 
Her depressed American counterpart, Amanda (Mira Billotte), is a sullen young woman with sawed-off blondish hair who, having used up her mother's credit card, ekes out a living taking short-term, dead-end jobs. When we first meet her, she is a squatter living in the shambles of an abandoned house across the highway from a shopping center. Using a scavenged video camera, she is taping a video diary, which she may or may not send to her half sister. 
 Tamiko and Amanda are numb in different ways. Tamiko is a workaholic automaton, always alone, obsessed with her job, who spends her spare moments teaching herself English phrases on a hand-held computer as she moves from hotel to hotel, waiting to hear from her employer. Never questioning authority, she marvels at all the space in the United States and naively parrots her bosses' chilling belief that, as she puts it, ''without a pure race, it will be difficult to have a pure goal for business.'' In the United States, she says, ''big Japanese factories are built where there will be less mixing and more racial harmony.'' 
 Between jobs, Amanda hangs out in malls hoping to elude the attention of security. One briefly held job is a turn selling candy and snacks on a sightseeing boat. The day that the tally of receipts doesn't exactly match the amount of food sold is the day, she is fired, although she insists she didn't steal. Her contract for another job states baldly that management may dismiss her ''at any time for any reason or for no reason.'' 
 She is also glimpsed sweeping sidewalks in front of a store and cleaning motel rooms. Nothing penetrates Amanda's cocoon of alienation, resignation and indifference. If she harbors anger, it is so deeply buried it seems permanently inaccessible. You also wonder, Are these the kinds of jobs that keep the unemployment rate down? 
 The work of a filmmaker whose music documentaries, ''Instrument'' (about the rock band Fugazi) and ''Benjamin Smoke'' (directed with Peter Sillen), are highly attuned to the details of their settings, ''Chain'' takes its time, the better to let its melancholy atmosphere seep into your bones. Some will lose patience. 
 It also deliberately blurs the lines between fiction, documentary and cinematic essay, although one wooden scene in which Amanda dawdles in a piano shop seems staged. 
 For all its bleakness, the movie, filmed in nearly a dozen states and in half a dozen countries, is not without a certain beauty. There is comfort to be found in blandness and homogeneity. And late in the film, when the camera lingers on a landscape darkening under a blood-red sunset, its evocation of human civilization at its twilight stirs up a piercing sadness.

HEADLINE: Incumbent In Queens Is Defeated By Old Rival 

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
In a rare defeat for an incumbent City Council member, Allan W. Jennings, a Queens Democrat whose candidacy had been shadowed by recent controversies, lost the party's primary yesterday to Thomas White Jr., Mr. Jennings's predecessor in the Council.
 Mr. Jennings has long been in a political war with the Queens Democratic organization, which poured its resources behind Mr. White's candidacy. Mr. White, who served in the Council for 10 years, defeated Mr. Jennings in three primaries in the 1990's. 
 The 28th Council District includes parts of Jamaica and Rochdale Village. With 100 percent of the districts reporting, Mr. White won the five-candidate primary with 40 percent of the vote, while Mr. Jennings came in second, with 30 percent.
 During the campaign, Mr. White and other Queens Democratic leaders called Mr. Jennings an affront to the district because he had been involved in embarrassing episodes. In April, the Council censured him after two female subordinates accused him of sexual harassment.
 Later, he was notified that his wages were being garnisheed by the Council because he failed to pay a $5,000 fine imposed by that body after its investigation found that he had harassed the women.
 In another race, in Brooklyn, Darlene Mealy, a transit worker and a political neophyte, won the city's most crowded primary election for a Council seat. Among the candidates she defeated was William F. Boyland Sr., a former assemblyman and the scion of one of Brooklyn's best known political families. 
 Ms. Mealy, who is virtually guaranteed of winning the general election in this overwhelmingly Democratic district, will succeed Mr. Boyland's daughter, City Councilwoman Tracy Boyland, who could not run again because of term limits.
 In the 10-candidate race in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, Ms. Mealy received 47 percent of the vote, according to incomplete results. Mr. Boyland came in second, with 19 percent.
 Ms. Mealy helped create a civic association in the district by putting together several block associations and has been a strong voice in the area for improving safety and promoting economic development.
 She won the endorsement of a number of influential unions, the Rev. Al Sharpton and United States Representative Major Owens, who defeated Ms. Boyland last year. 
 There are likely to be several other new council members as a result of yesterday's elections, nearly all of which occurred in heavily Democratic areas.
 On the Lower East Side of Manhattan, the winner of the seven-candidate primary was Rosie Mendez, the former chief of staff for City Councilwoman Margarita Lopez, the incumbent who was barred by term limits from running for re-election. Ms. Mendez, who has worked as a tenant organizer with various groups, received 36 percent of the vote.
 Also in Manhattan, the winner of the race to succeed Gifford Miller as the council member from the East Side was Jessica Lappin, the manager of Mr. Miller's district office. Ms. Lappin won a four-candidate race with 55 percent of the vote. 
 In the Council race to succeed Eva Moskowitz, who ran and lost for Manhattan borough president, the winner was Dan Garodnick, a lawyer who served as president of a Democratic club on the East Side of Manhattan.

HEADLINE: Reviving A City: The Design Perspective

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
Even as the federal government and local developers push to resurrect New Orleans as quickly as possible in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, some architects and urban planners are contemplating the larger question of what form the city should take -- whether restored, reimagined or something in between. 
 ''I hesitate to say there is a silver lining,'' said Michael Sorkin, director of the City College of New York's graduate urban design program. ''But it would be a wasted opportunity if one didn't think in a systematic way about the 21st-century city.''
Among the questions facing architects are whether the city's footprint should be irrelevant, given that so many residents may not return; whether surviving industries should be pivotal to what is built; whether preservation should trump other priorities; and whether bold new architecture can or should rise from the muck and devastation. 
 Many experts also warned against moving too quickly, arguing that being away from the city could help residents clarify what was most valued and should be reclaimed. 
 ''This is one of the few moments in time in which the entire population of a city can tell you what they miss about it,'' said Mark Wigley, dean of Columbia University's Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation. ''It's like when people sit around a room wearing black talking about the person who's gone. The French Quarter is probably one of the smallest elements of what people treasure.''
 ''Any city that only tries to preserve itself is already dead,'' Mr. Wigley added. ''The great tragedy would be to embalm New Orleans by simply rebuilding it the way it was.''
 Alexander Garvin, an urban planning professor at Yale University, said: ''Here we have a chance to look at the street system, public open space, to ask ourselves what are the things there we want to keep of great historic and cultural significance.''
 ''If you start with what you want to retain,'' he added, ''you have a framework.''
 Most architects and planners say preservation should be a priority. ''There was a very unique vernacular,'' said Angela O'Byrne, president of the New Orleans chapter of the American Institute of Architects. She pointed to the city's mix of Greek Revival, Italianate and Creole styles, and to its cottages and bungalows with porches suited to the climate, adding, ''As much as possible, all of it needs to come back.'' 
 Steve Dumez, another New Orleans architect, agreed: ''We fundamentally believe New Orleans is too important a city to be a throwaway. We intend to work hard to make certain that it does come back.''
 The French Quarter, with its mix of Spanish and French influences, wrought-iron balconies and ornate cornices, is on high ground and was therefore largely spared from the flooding. Damage to the historic Garden District was similarly limited. 
 But some architects cautioned that the historic quarters should not be the only focus. ''New Orleans -- along with San Francisco -- is the greatest collection of 18th-, 19th- and early-20th-century residential architecture in the United States,'' said Reed Kroloff, the dean of the School of Architecture at Tulane University in New Orleans. ''You're talking about miles and miles of historic properties.
 ''But saving the historic context does not mean necessarily rebuilding everything in it,'' he added. ''I don't think you build a bad 21st-century copy of a brilliant 19th-century building.'' 
 Architects and planners worry that developers might try to recreate some fairy-tale version of the city, compromising its 300-year-old character. ''My big concern is that it will become a Disneyland,'' said Raymond G. Post Jr., a Baton Rouge architect. ''If we come up with a plastic New Orleans, then you've got a plastic New Orleans. You lose the charm and the quaintness and the crooked walls and the old shutters.''
 Without the rejuvenation of the city's varied industries, and with too much reliance on tourism, the city could become something of a stage set where people work but do not live, some experts said. ''That's a recipe for a Venice,'' said Terence Riley, chief curator of the Museum of Modern Art's architecture and design department, who described that city as being ''on life support.''
 Trula Remson, president of the Louisiana chapter of the American Institute of Architects, pleaded for deliberation and care. ''I'm concerned that particularly residentially, it may be built back cheaply and quickly,'' she said. ''You don't want to build something that's not going to stand the test of time.''
 At the same time, the sense of a clean slate offers an opportunity to improve on what was poorly conceived or constructed, and to aim for some contemporary architectural distinction. ''I hope we see some progressive design,'' Ms. Remson said. 
 Some architects and planners urged a rethinking of New Orleans's sprawl, arguing that the city should be consolidated. Indeed, given that New Orleans may be uninhabitable for six months to a year, many residents are likely to put down roots elsewhere, planning experts say, greatly reducing what was a population of nearly 500,000.
 ''The most difficult thing to do might be the planning of the shrinking of the city,'' said Mr. Riley, the MoMA architecture curator. 
 If the population contracts sharply, he said, any effort to duplicate the city's former footprint will leave some areas largely deserted, robbing the metropolis of its overall texture and vitality. 
 Others emphasize that the city's low-income housing was due for an overhaul long before the hurricane. ''I think this is an opportunity to rethink some of the urban planning,'' Ms. O'Byrne said. ''Some of the blighted areas probably needed to be bulldozed anyway.''
 If there is any social dividend from the hurricane, some architects and planners said, it is the view the storm afforded of how the other half lives, the areas that are not in the guidebooks. ''We have to get past the standardized image,'' Mr. Wigley said. ''It didn't include any of the poor people -- any of those neighborhoods that we only know now because they're filled with water.''
 Any discussion of aesthetics, experts agree, must come second to improving the city's infrastructure. New regulations may be established, for example, about building higher and about where a building's first habitable floor should be.
 ''The city needs to be understood as a wetlands that's been drained, with new elevations that move people out of harm's way,'' said Dan Williams, an urban and regional planner who helped rebuild South Florida after Hurricane Andrew in 1992.
 ''At what point do you decide, like San Francisco did, like Seattle in the early 1900's, to build up and over an existing structure?'' Mr. Williams asked. ''It's important to talk right now about strategies in terms of long-term planning.''
 Ms. Remson of the architectural institute said: ''We're going to try to educate our architects about the technology available now for making things flood-proof. So much will have to be torn down, we're going to want to build better.''

HEADLINE: Trade Deficit Narrows as Imports Decline 

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
The nation's trade deficit narrowed in July and producer prices rose at a moderate pace in August, the government reported yesterday, as soaring costs of crude oil and petroleum products were unexpectedly offset by falling imports and muted overall inflation. 
 But economists cautioned that the data, which covers periods before Hurricane Katrina struck late last month, may not indicate sustained improvement. The hurricane has severely disrupted the energy supply system and major transportation links in the gulf region, and that could disrupt trade and lead to higher inflation in coming months.
The trade deficit declined by 2.6 percent in July, to $57.9 billion, according to the Commerce Department, as imports of consumer and capital goods fell and exports of industrial material and capital goods rose. Economists had been expecting the deficit to widen to $59.8 billion. (The June trade gap was revised up to $59.5 billion from a previously reported $58.8 billion.) 
 The Producer Price Index, which measures prices of goods and services at the wholesale level, rose 0.6 percent in August. Energy prices were up 3.7 percent, with gasoline prices surging 9.5 percent. Excluding energy and food prices, the so-called core rate was unchanged. Economists had been expecting an overall increase of 0.7 percent and a rise in the core rate of 0.1 percent. 
 Over a 12-month period from August 2004, producer prices were up 5.1 percent over all and 2.4 percent excluding food and energy.
 The decline in imports was noteworthy, given that Americans spent $1 billion more on crude oil and other petroleum imports in July. Imports of oil and other petroleum products fell 3.3 percent, measured in terms of barrels, but the price per barrel soared 10.4 percent in just a month.
 Several economists said the drop in total imports appeared to have been driven by businesses' growing reluctance to stockpile goods in anticipation of sales, helping keep costs low. ''They are trying to keep things very lean,'' said Brian Jones, an economist at Citigroup.
 Imports of consumer goods including drugs, clothes and jewelry fell 2.2 percent, and capital goods including aircraft, drilling equipment and computers also fell 2.2 percent. 
 Among major trading partners, the deficit with China grew 0.3 percent, to $17.7 billion, and shrank 26 percent with Mexico, to $3.5 billion.
 It remains unclear how the hurricane will affect trade and prices in the next few months, but a few effects already stand out.
 Higher gasoline prices, for instance, can be expected to increase the rate of inflation and, at least temporarily, to restrain Americans' appetites for other goods and services as people adjust their spending and pay more for transportation, electricity and, in a few months, heating. 
 ''You are going to clearly see a hit to consumer spending,'' said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at Maria Fiorini Ramirez, a research and consulting firm in New York. But ''it's not going to be anything more than temporary.''
 The average retail price for all grades of gasoline nationwide was $2.956 a gallon on Monday, according to the Energy Information Administration. That was down from a peak of $3.083 on Labor Day, but still about 60 cents higher than it was a month earlier and about $1 a gallon more than in September 2004. 
 With trade, the hurricane's effect could be manifold and unpredictable. Certainly, higher oil and gasoline prices will drive up the total cost of those imports, but disruptions to major ports, waterways and other transportation links in the gulf region could limit other imports. 
 ''Because we import more than we export,'' Mr. Jones of Citigroup said, ''we may get some unusually good-looking data on the surface'' as the trade gap appears to be narrowing.
 Much more reliable information on the hurricane's nationwide effect will become available after temporary supply disruptions have been dealt with and consumers have adjusted their behavior to accommodate higher prices. 
 ''It's hard enough forecasting when things are reasonably stable,'' Mr. Jones said. Now, ''you have to take all of our forecasts with a grain of salt.''

HEADLINE: For Ferrer, A Night Of Tension On the Edge

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
Fernando Ferrer was on tenterhooks last night, as he and his aides sifted through the minutiae of poll returns and absentee ballots, wondering if he would be able to capture 40 percent of the vote in the Democratic primary and avoid a runoff against United States Representative Anthony D. Weiner.
 It was an almost reverse replay of four years ago, when Mr. Ferrer came from behind to win a spot in the runoff election, only to lose to Mark Green by a hair.
Still, even as some of his aides conceded that a runoff appeared more likely than not, Mr. Ferrer sounded like a man sure of his victory, and he spoke glowingly of his Democratic competitors as he addressed supporters at the Grand Ballroom of the Puck Building, at Houston and Lafayette Streets. 
 ''The road has been long my friends,'' he said, ''but this journey has been worth it, and we're almost there because we're about to make history.''
 Ferrer supporters and staff members began filling up the ballroom as the polls closed. The mood was mostly jubilant, even though what appeared to be an early lead by Mr. Ferrer dwindled as the evening wore on and the prospect that he would have to face Congressman Weiner in a runoff became more likely. 
 The only down moment for the crowd came as Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg appeared on television screens around the ballroom, shown addressing supporters at his own primary-night party in Brooklyn..
 Many of Mr. Ferrer's supporters, including Bronx Borough President Adolfo Carrion, City Comptroller William C. Thompson, State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer and the former state comptroller H. Carl McCall, were on hand to rouse the crowd and rally around Mr. Ferrer.
 ''They said that we couldn't get to where we are tonight,'' the Rev. Al Sharpton told the cheering crowd. ''Well it looks like they were wrong. But they ain't seen nothing yet. Wait until November, when we say New York is not for sale.''
 Mr. Ferrer, 55, took some missteps early in his campaign, making seemingly inconsistent statements and factual errors that the Bloomberg campaign seized upon to label him a flip-flopper. He also had hurt his standing among black leaders and voters by saying that the 1999 fatal police shooting of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant, was not a crime.
 But after a campaign shake-up that included the departure of a spokesman and media consultant, things quieted down and Mr. Ferrer began sticking largely to scripted and choreographed events. New staff members joined the team, endorsements began to roll in and suddenly Mr. Ferrer seemed within striking distance of the 40 percent of the votes needed to avoid a runoff.
 In recent days, Mr. Ferrer shifted into a higher gear, all but returning to his controversial theme of two New Yorks divided by economic disparity, and displaying some of the fire reminiscent of his failed 2001. He received a flurry of endorsements, including that of Mr. Sharpton, intended as an 11th-hour push that would seem decisive in Mr. Ferrer's avoiding a runoff and capturing the nomination.
 But things did not quite work out that way, with Mr. Weiner's late surge changing the dynamic of the contest.
 Mr. Ferrer spent his last day shoring up his base, starting out voting at a Riverdale center for the elderly and eating breakfast with a group of Bronx officials. After a stop in Washington Heights, he took a high-spirited walk along 125th Street in Harlem with Mr. Sharpton and other supporters, including Adriano Espaillat, a candidate for Manhattan borough president, and Mr. Thompson, the city comptroller. Mr. Ferrer then appeared at a Lower East Side subway stop to rally voters to the polls.

HEADLINE: Singapore And Katrina

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: Singapore 

 BODY:
There is something troublingly self-indulgent and slothful about America today -- something that Katrina highlighted and that people who live in countries where the laws of gravity still apply really noticed. It has rattled them -- like watching a parent melt down. 
 That is certainly the sense I got after observing the Katrina debacle from half a world away here in Singapore -- a city-state that, if it believes in anything, believes in good governance. It may roll up the sidewalks pretty early here, and it may even fine you if you spit out your gum, but if you had to choose anywhere in Asia you would want to be caught in a typhoon, it would be Singapore. Trust me, the head of Civil Defense here is not simply someone's college roommate. 
Indeed, Singapore believes so strongly that you have to get the best-qualified and least-corruptible people you can into senior positions in the government, judiciary and civil service that its pays its prime minister a salary of $1.1 million a year. It pays its cabinet ministers and Supreme Court justices just under $1 million a year, and pays judges and senior civil servants handsomely down the line.
 From Singapore's early years, good governance mattered because the ruling party was in a struggle for the people's hearts and minds with the Communists, who were perceived to be both noncorrupt and caring -- so the state had to be the same and more.
 Even after the Communists faded, Singapore maintained a tradition of good governance because as a country of only four million people with no natural resources, it had to live by its wits. It needed to run its economy and schools in a way that would extract the maximum from each citizen, which is how four million people built reserves of $100 billion.
 ''In the areas that are critical to our survival, like Defense, Finance and the Ministry of Home Affairs, we look for the best talent,'' said Kishore Mahbubani, dean of the Lee Kwan Yew School of Public Policy. ''You lose New Orleans, and you have 100 other cities just like it. But we're a city-state. We lose Singapore and there is nothing else. [So] the standards of discipline are very high. There is a very high degree of accountability in Singapore.''
 When a subway tunnel under construction collapsed here in April 2004 and four workers were killed, a government inquiry concluded that top executives of the contracting company should be either fined or jailed.
 The discipline that the cold war imposed on America, by contrast, seems to have faded. Last year, we cut the National Science Foundation budget, while indulging absurd creationist theories in our schools and passing pork-laden energy and transportation bills in the middle of an energy crisis.
 We let the families of the victims of 9/11 redesign our intelligence organizations, and our president and Congress held a midnight session about the health care of one woman, Terri Schiavo, while ignoring the health crisis of 40 million uninsured. Our economy seems to be fueled lately by either suing each other or selling each other houses. Our government launched a war in Iraq without any real plan for the morning after, and it cut taxes in the middle of that war, ensuring that future generations would get the bill. 
 Speaking of Katrina, Sumiko Tan, a columnist for the Sunday edition of The Straits Times in Singapore, wrote: ''We were shocked at what we saw. Death and destruction from natural disaster is par for the course. But the pictures of dead people left uncollected on the streets, armed looters ransacking shops, survivors desperate to be rescued, racial divisions -- these were truly out of sync with what we'd imagined the land of the free to be, even if we had encountered homelessness and violence on visits there. If America becomes so unglued when bad things happen in its own backyard, how can it fulfill its role as leader of the world?''
 Janadas Devan, a Straits Times columnist, tried to explain to his Asian readers how the U.S. is changing. ''Today's conservatives,'' he wrote, ''differ in one crucial aspect from yesterday's conservatives: the latter believed in small government, but believed, too, that a country ought to pay for all the government that it needed.
 ''The former believe in no government, and therefore conclude that there is no need for a country to pay for even the government that it does have. [But] it is not only government that doesn't show up when government is starved of resources and leached of all its meaning. Community doesn't show up either, sacrifice doesn't show up, pulling together doesn't show up, 'we're all in this together' doesn't show up.''

HEADLINE: In This Small Town in Iowa The Future Speaks Spanish 

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:

Denison, Iowa
Searching for the Soul of America Through the Secrets of a Midwest Town
By Dale Maharidge
Photographs by Michael Williamson. 259 pages. Free Press. $25.
 Denison, Iowa, has a motto, painted right on the town water tower: ''It's a Wonderful Life.'' It's an allusion. Donna Reed, who starred in the film of the same name, grew up on a farm just outside Denison, a town of about 8,000 that, in its heyday, could have served as a stand-in for the movie's fictional Bedford Falls.
Delete the reference, and the motto takes on a poignant double meaning in Dale Maharidge's revealing portrait of a representative small town in the American heartland. In Denison, the wonderful life began disappearing 20 years ago for the workers in its meatpacking plants, where competition within the industry forced wage cuts. Young people no longer stay in Denison. Its main street has withered, and the few remaining businesses in town struggle to stay afloat. 
 For them, the future looks bleak, but for a new wave of mostly Mexican immigrants, many fleeing crime and $5-an-hour jobs in California, the upbeat message on the water tower seems like the unvarnished truth. They have no idea who Donna Reed was, but Denison, with its plants paying $8 to $10 an hour, and its safe neighborhoods, looks a lot like the promised land.
 Mr. Maharidge, the author of ''And Their Children After Them,'' a study of the Alabama families photographed by Walker Evans, lived for a year in Denison, a town he selected more or less at random. If the subtitle of ''Denison, Iowa,'' is to be taken literally, he spent his time ''Searching for the Soul of America,'' accompanied by his photographer partner, Michael Williamson. 
 Fortunately, he did no such thing. Instead, he wandered around talking to people. He sat in on the English classes taught at night by Georgia Hollrah, a volunteer determined to help Denison's new arrivals. He spent time with Luis Navar, a go-getter from Mexico trying to get a foothold as the town's first Latino contractor, and he attended endless City Council meetings watching the mayor trying to sell an ambitious redevelopment scheme aimed at reversing Denison's decline. 
 By making the rounds, talking and listening, Mr. Maharidge got his best material. ''Denison, Iowa'' comes to life when the townspeople reflect on their struggles, their hopes and their fears. ''We're a microcosm in an area that's not used to it,'' the high school principal says, reflecting on Denison's difficulties in assimilating Hispanic immigrants. ''They're used to it on the coasts. We just happen to be an early part of the change here in the Midwest. This is what America is going to be everywhere.'' 
 When Mr. Maharidge keeps his nose to the ground he does fine. When he steps back to look at the big picture he often stumbles. Isolated and often lonely in his rented room, a fleabag apartment carved out of a grand Victorian house that once belonged to Teddy Roosevelt's secretary of the treasury, he spends a little too much time meditating on the town's history and the global economic forces roiling the American economy. Lectures on 19th-century economic theory and the free-silver debate drag the narrative down. It is clear that Mr. Maharidge is in over his head when discussing American history and economics. 
 Worse, inspired by ''Winesburg, Ohio,'' Mr. Maharidge shifts from straightforward, first-person reporting in a series of quasi-fictional chapters featuring himself as a character called ''the writer,'' a poetic soul wandering Denison's lonely streets looking for sad American ''truths.'' (''The old man was always laughing. He had the laugh of a man who had seen things, yet had not been made ancient by them.'') Mr. Maharidge is not, to put it kindly, a stylist. He's a crusading, shoe-leather journalist who does his best work when he puts down the plain facts in plain English.
 The facts are these. Denison, with its heavily German population, prospered as a farm town in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and then, as small family farms came under pressure after the Depression, recast its economy by setting up meatpacking plants in the 1950's. Workers earned union wages. Downtown thrived. Then came the 1980's, and a disastrous strike at Farmland, a local meatpacking plant, that ended with workers taking a pay cut and the union more or less imploding. 
 The disappearance of the old family farms, and a blue-collar workforce earning less than blue-collar wages, spelled disaster. Denison, in common with 40 percent of Iowa's cities, began losing population. ''Besides beef and pork products, Denison's biggest export is young people,'' Mr. Maharidge writes. Nathan Mahrt, a local preservationist, tells the author that he is one of only three graduates in his high-school class of 133 to remain in town. 
 Immigration may very well be Denison's only hope. Hispanics now account for at least a third of its population, a trend that will only accelerate. Although minorities make up 20 percent of the high school population, they account for half of the kindergarten. Many local residents resent the newcomers, in a low-key Midwestern way. Latinos and whites, even in a town as small as Denison, live separate lives, separated by language and cultural misunderstanding. When a Mexican couple opened a taqueria, they did not realize that American customers would expect menus and utensils. When the local Chamber of Commerce tried to contact them, Mexican business owners assumed it was a Mexican-style extortion racket.
 Denison's future hangs in the balance. If it can manage cultural change, and absorb its young, ambitious Mexican population, it might hang on. But the white power structure still dreams of the Denison of the 1950's, or of selling the town as a convention destination. Good intentions abound, but as one resident tells the author, ''The truth is, we have pathetically little to market.'' 
 As Mr. Maharidge tells it, the future lies not with Denison's annual Donna Reed festival, but in people like Luis Navar, who, in the book's final, hopeful pages, lands his first big construction project and may just be on his way to a wonderful life.

HEADLINE: A Rescue Mission Under Control: Houston Adjusts Well on the Fly 

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL; Maureen Balleza contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Sept. 13 

 BODY:
If any city in the country was ready for the disaster of Hurricane Katrina, it was Houston.
 When the catastrophic storm set off the largest mass migration in modern American history, this subtropical-oiltown-turned-energy-capital of two million people quickly set an extra 200,000 places for dinner.
And just as quickly, it has been emptying the shelters so swiftly set up, resettling a vast population in homes, apartments and hotels, with the goal of having all survivors off emergency cots by this weekend. 
 Now Houstonians, steeped in accolades for their hospitality, are grappling with questions of how the crisis will change their hometown, America's fourth-most populous city, and how it already has. 
 Nearly 2,000 college students who started the semester in New Orleans -- including Loyola University's entire law school -- are suddenly studying here, courtesy of the University of Houston, Texas Southern University and Rice University. Houston public schools, already gripped by a statewide financing crisis that has stymied Texas lawmakers, have scrambled to make space for more than 3,400 new pupils, reopening two buildings that had been closed.
 A grass-roots people-power movement has sprouted in the Astrodome. For a quarter-century, most of the immigrants into Houston came from abroad; that has been reversed overnight. A glut of overbuilt housing units from a sluggish economy has been all but wiped out at a stroke. And a scarce job market has thousands of newcomers to deal with, though New Orleans port workers are being eagerly recruited. 
 The mood is clearly upbeat. ''We're a bigger community today just in terms of our heart,'' said Judge Robert Eckels, Harris County's top official, who has led the local effort with Mayor Bill White of Houston. 
 If Houston became ''the shock absorber of the nation,'' in the judge's phrase, it was partly because of its size; Chicago and Philadelphia would fit nicely inside Houston's 630 square miles, with room left over for Baltimore and Detroit.
 It also boasts the nation's largest medical center, with 13 hospitals and 11 educational institutions employing more than 65,000 people. There were so many volunteers last week that 300 doctors from the Baylor College of Medicine were put on a waiting list.
 And Houston is a city of big givers. A leftover doughnut auctioned off by a radio station last week drew up to $15,300 for hurricane survivors.
 But some fear a grim side. Rumors of lurid crimes abound, without basis, the police say, and gun dealers report an uptick in sales. Mayor White, ending his first two-year term on a surge of popularity, has taken pains to assure residents that they would not be short-changed in favor of the visitors. 
 There was, many here say, no place better positioned to offer relief to storm sufferers. As a city, Houston has only one-third the urban density of Los Angeles, and is the core of a metropolitan area of five million people in eight counties covering nearly 9,000 square miles -- bigger than Massachusetts.
 With a struggling economy, Houston had lots of housing available. And the city is attuned to weather crises. Four years ago, tropical storm Allison caused billions of dollars in damage, and the city is often on the target list of hurricanes from the Gulf of Mexico. ''Houston has had more declarations of disaster than any other city in America; we flood a lot,'' said Frank E. Gutierrez, emergency management coordinator of Harris County. 
 Eventually, on the peak day of Sept. 4, more than 30,000 people were processed and 27,100 sheltered, a subset of an estimated 200,000 Katrina evacuees who found refuge in the Houston area.
 When Dr. David Persse, Houston's emergency medical service director, first entered the Astrodome, he said, he thought of the radio announcer who, on witnessing the Hindenburg disaster, lamented, ''Oh, the humanity!'' 
 But now, as quickly as the shelters were filled, they have begun to empty. People are being relocated to the area's 55,000 hotel and motel rooms and thousands of unoccupied apartments and houses, or being offered travel stipends to leave town. 
 By Tuesday, only 4,823 remained in the city's shelters and 1,800 more at 25 shelters run by the Red Cross. Almost 4,000 people have been placed in longer-term housing and nearly 50,000 in hotel rooms. 
 Many credited the leadership of Mayor White and Judge Eckels, who kept tight reins on the relief effort through daily meetings of city, county, state and federal officials, 8 a.m. sessions at which Mr. White sometimes chided government -- at all levels -- for its bureaucratic ways. 
 Renee Barrios, an organizer with the Industrial Areas Foundation, including the Metropolitan Organization, which recruits local leadership to tackle community problems, praised the judge and mayor for inviting her group into planning sessions and for encouraging self-government by those in the shelters. 
 Houston's medical establishment was also quick to respond. As of last week, more than 1,000 physicians from Baylor, after their regular rounds, treated 6,000 patients who came through the shelters at the Astrodome and Reliant Center and Arena. Downtown, the George R. Brown Convention Center, which also held thousands of evacuees, drew up to 400 doctors and at least 2,000 nurses, dentists and other health professionals from the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston.
 But as caught up in the rescue as they were, Houstonians also struggled with concerns about dislocations in a city whose population has long been seen as carefully balanced, made up of roughly 30 percent each for white, nonwhite Hispanic, and black, and 10 percent Asian. 
 Until 1982, other Americans accounted for the bulk of migration into Houston, said Stephen L. Klineberg, a sociology professor at Rice. Since then a wave of Latin Americans, Asians and Africans reversed the trend in favor of foreign immigrants. Now, he said, the disaster promises a reversal yet again. 
 Some voiced concern about the burden on already stressed social services. ''Most people are focused on coping with very practical problems and are not ready to face emotional problems,'' said Betsy Schwartz, executive director of the Mental Health Association of Greater Houston. At a minimum, she estimated, 4,000 to 7,000 of the storm survivors who came here could develop post traumatic stress disorder. And Texas, she said, already ranked 46th in per capita financing for mental health care. 
 Houston's police chief, Harold Hurtt, meeting with reporters last week, took pains to dispel what he called ''some of the rumors that there is rampant criminal activity in our city.'' Actually, he said, calls for service were down. But he said there had been 113 arrests of evacuees for lesser offenses and that police overtime costs for the first week totaled about $1 million, largely reimbursable by the federal government. 
 Some people have wondered whether Houston's button-down business style might benefit from a dose of Big Easy, but Chief Hurtt drew a line. ''Unlike Louisiana, where you get a citation for marijuana, here you'll be arrested,'' he said.

HEADLINE: North Korea Talks Resume, Still in a Standoff

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: BEIJING, Sept. 13 

 BODY:
Talks over how to end North Korea's nuclear weapons program resumed in Beijing on Tuesday, but the United States and North Korea showed few signs of settling a dispute over the peaceful uses of nuclear power that broke up previous negotiations.
 Repeating the same demands that led to the collapse of talks five weeks ago, North Korea insisted Tuesday that it had the right to maintain a peaceful nuclear energy program after it dismantles its nuclear bombs, and that the United States must acknowledge that right in advance.-
While some analysts held out hope that the issue could be finessed so that the six nations participating in the negotiations could at least agree on a statement of principles for future discussions, several diplomats warned that even such an interim step seemed insurmountable in the current environment. 
 The standoff is a heavy burden for the Bush administration, which has failed to slow North Korea's nuclear program since it accused the country of violating a previous pact in 2002 and vowed to take a tougher line than the Clinton administration had.
 The Stalinist North Korean government expelled United Nations weapons inspectors in 2002 and now says it has working nuclear bombs, which it says it needs to protect itself from the ''hostile policy'' of the United States. Administration officials have put new emphasis on negotiating with the North and have relaxed earlier demands that the country disarm itself unilaterally before they would consider offering diplomatic or economic incentives.
 But some analysts say they fear that North Korea does not intend to give up its weapons program, which its leaders view as a cornerstone of their security and a bargaining chip to demand economic aid for its ailing economy.
 China is the host of the current talks, which include South Korea, Japan and Russia as well as the United States and North Korea, and are a continuation of a previous, marathon round of talks in early August that ended in frustration. 
 Although the United States and North Korea continued back-channel discussions during the intervening five-week period, they apparently did not bridge many differences.
 ''I can't say there has been much progress'' during the recess, Christopher Hill, the chief American envoy to the talks, said shortly after his arrival in Beijing on Tuesday afternoon. ''We will have to talk to see where we are.''
 Mr. Hill said that rather than focusing on how to reduce existing disagreements, the North Koreans had added new obstacles. ''Their position seems to be evolving a little,'' he said.
 The talks formally got under way on Tuesday afternoon. There is no scheduled conclusion date.
 Kim Gye Gwan, the country's top nuclear negotiator, told the New China News Agency on Tuesday that North Korea must have reactors for nuclear energy.
 North Korea ''has a right to have peaceful nuclear activity,'' Mr. Kim said before boarding his flight to Beijing at the airport in Pyongyang, the capital. ''This right is neither awarded nor needs approval by others.'' 
 The Bush administration argues that North Korea has no need for nuclear power plants. Washington has supported an offer by South Korea to build several nuclear or conventional power plants near its border with North Korea to provide energy if the North agrees to denuclearize.
 Administration officials say that North Korea violated a 1994 pact with the Clinton administration when it used a nuclear power plant to produce plutonium for atomic bombs and so cannot now be trusted with any kind of nuclear technology.
 ''Nuclear weapons, nuclear programs are not something that one should leave in an ambiguous state,'' Mr. Hill told reporters before leaving Washington. ''North Korea has trouble keeping its peaceful programs peaceful.''
 The peaceful use issue raises delicate questions for the United States because China, Russia and South Korea have all argued that they see no reason why North Korea cannot retain civilian nuclear plants. Only Japan has backed the American position.
 That suggests that the issue is an effective one for North Korea if its main purpose in the talks is to isolate the United States from the other parties. In that way, the North might escape blame for the failure of the talks while maintaining relatively cordial relations with its neighbors.
 Chinese analysts say they have low expectations for this round, arguing that neither the United States nor North Korea has enough confidence in the other to reach an agreement that will require some level of trust.

HEADLINE: Blacks Hit Hardest By Costlier Mortgages 

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 13 

 BODY:
Regardless of income levels, blacks were about three times as likely as whites to borrow through more expensive ''subprime'' mortgages last year, according to a nationwide lending survey released Tuesday by the Federal Reserve.
 The new report, based on data collected from 8,853 lenders, is the Fed's first attempt to look for evidence of racial and ethnic discrimination in the booming business in exotic mortgages and subprime lending.
Among low-income home buyers, about 39.2 percent of blacks but only 12.9 percent of whites took out high-priced mortgages, which the Fed defined as loans with interest rates about two percentage points higher than those for ''prime'' customers with good credit.
 For buyers of a $200,000 house last year, that would have meant about $3,000 extra in annual interest payments. 
 In its report, the Fed cautioned that its study included no data on the credit ratings of individual borrowers, which greatly affects the rates they must pay. The Fed also said that part of the gap could be explained by differences in the kinds of mortgages that people used and by differences among lenders.
 But even after adjusting for those differences, blacks were nearly twice as likely as whites at every income level to take out expensive mortgages.
 Douglas Duncan, chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association in Washington, said the Fed's report showed little evidence of racial or ethnic discrimination.
 ''To us, it seemed they were saying you could explain the majority of differences,'' Mr. Duncan said. ''You would expect to see higher-priced loans in higher-priced categories.''
 But Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic Policy Research in Washington, said this merely pointed to a larger issue: ''The discrimination is about why you end up going to a subprime lender in the first place,'' Mr. Baker said.
 ''It is striking to see such a difference'' between members of minority groups and whites, Mr. Baker said. ''What it shows is that blacks and Hispanics are paying a lot more for mortgages than whites who appear to be comparably situated.'' Under a longstanding mandate from Congress, the Federal Reserve has for years analyzed the rates at which people in different ethnic groups were being denied mortgage loans.
 But that measure had become increasingly dated as banks and other mortgage lenders developed a kaleidoscope of high-cost subprime mortgages for people who would have simply been rejected outright in the past on the basis of poor credit or inadequate income.
 Subprime mortgages, almost nonexistent 10 years ago, accounted for more than 10 percent of all new home mortgages last year; analysts say they are a major reason that homeownership rates have climbed sharply among African-Americans and Hispanics.
 The new study raised but did not answer the question of why blacks, and to a lesser extent Hispanics, have been induced to pay higher rates.
 Even among high-income borrowers, which the Fed defined as people who earned more than 120 percent of the median income in their area, blacks and Hispanics were far more likely to take out high-cost mortgages.
 Among higher-income borrowers, 23.9 percent of blacks took out high-cost mortgages, compared to 17.4 percent of high-income Hispanics and 5.8 percent of whites.
 Asian-Americans, by contrast, were less likely on average than whites to take out high-cost loans.
 In its study, the Fed said that a large part of the contrast between mortgages to blacks and whites could be attributed to differences in lending institutions.
 Put another way, the gap between blacks and whites who borrowed from the same lenders was much smaller that the overall gap between blacks and whites. 
 According to the Fed's data, the vast bulk of high-priced subprime lending was handled by a small number of institutions. Of the 8,800 mortgage lenders that provided data, only 500 said they had made more than 100 subprime loans last year. Ten lenders accounted for 38 percent of all the loans that were made.
 The Fed study could provide new ammunition to critics of subprime lenders who accuse such institutions of predatory lending practices.
 In addition to paying much higher interest rates than ''prime'' borrowers with strong credit, subprime customers are often locked into their mortgages for three to five years and forced to pay big penalties if they try to refinance with a cheaper mortgage.
 In an attempt to shed more light on the issue of discrimination, Fed researchers delved into data from eight major subprime mortgage lenders that was collected by the Credit Research Center at Georgetown University.

HEADLINE: U.N. Adopts Modest Goals On Reforms and Poverty

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 13 

 BODY:
The General Assembly unanimously approved a scaled-down statement of goals on Tuesday that Secretary General Kofi Annan said would still give world leaders gathering Wednesday a basis for recommendations to reform the organization and combat poverty.
 Loud cheers from the delegates, however, could not disguise widespread disappointment at the weakening of the 35-page document.
 When Mr. Annan first proposed the statement, it represented an ambitious blueprint for trying to balance the concerns of great powers over security, human rights and management efficiency with the developing world's needs for increased assistance and measures to cut poverty. In the end, virtually every section underwent severe cutbacks. 
 ''Obviously, we didn't get everything we wanted,'' Mr. Annan said. ''With 191 member states, it's not easy to get an agreement. But we can build on it.'' He noted that it represented progress in setting up a human rights council to replace the discredited Human Rights Commission and a new peace-building commission. He also singled out language on how to fight terrorism and establish means for international intervention when countries failed to protect their citizens from genocide.
 He complained pointedly, however, about the elimination in the final version of language covering nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament, labeling the exclusion a ''disgrace'' at a time when the world feared a spread of unconventional weapons.
 John R. Bolton, the American ambassador, said the United States was satisfied with the outcome, which he said matched the limited hopes he had had for the document.
 ''It would be wrong to claim more than is realistic and accurate about what these reforms are,'' he said. ''They represent steps forward, but this is not the alpha and omega, and we never thought it would be.''
 The General Assembly vote ended three weeks of tense talks at which regional rivalries and national ambitions succeeded in scuttling attempts by a majority of nations to act in the broader United Nations interest. The continuing debate exposed in high profile the kind of indecisiveness that the document was supposed to address.
 ''There were governments that were not willing to make the concessions necessary,'' Mr. Annan said. ''There were spoilers also in the group, let's be quite honest about that.'' 
 In his discussions with member states, he said, ''I've tried to get them to understand that in our interconnected world, we need to look at issues in much broader terms rather than narrow national interests.''
 In answer to a question, he said he wished voting procedures could be changed so that a small minority of nations could not block the will of a large majority, as has occurred during recent weeks.
 Mr. Bolton, a vocal critic of the organization's practices, seized on the events to say: ''This is the way the U.N. operates. And it goes to the question, which is a much longer term question, as to whether the culture of decision-making at the U.N. is the most effective for the organization, and that's something that's not going to be resolved today or tomorrow.''
 The three-day meeting is expected to attract more than 170 presidents and prime ministers. The document they will be asked to approve does create a human rights council, but it leaves out any mention of its size and duties and drops language proposing that membership be subject to a two-thirds vote of the General Assembly. That was meant to insure that notorious rights offenders would not become members. While it condemns terrorism ''in all forms,'' language saying that making targets of civilians is unjustified was deleted in exchange for dropping language exempting movements to resist occupation.
 Management reform does not include strengthening the Secretary General's office, which is considered essential if the office is to have the flexibility to act decisively. In this case, a small group of developing countries blocked action out of fear of seeing power taken away from the General Assembly, where their voices are heard but where real decision-taking is discouraged.

HEADLINE: Knight Ridder Expects Difficult Quarter

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Knight Ridder said yesterday that third-quarter earnings, excluding discontinued operations, would drop about 20 percent from a year earlier. 
Wall Street analysts, on average, had been expecting earnings of 89 cents a share, excluding any extraordinary items and discontinued operations, according to Reuters Estimates.
 Knight Ridder, based in San Jose, Calif., said many factors would restrain profit.
The negative factors include a rise of 9.1 percent in the price of newsprint; rising health care costs; the start of depreciation on a new plant in Kansas City, Mo.; higher interest expense; and Hurricane Katrina's devastation to the economy in Gulfport and Biloxi, Miss., where the company publishes The Sun Herald.

HEADLINE: U.N. vs. Poverty: Seeking a Focus, Quarreling Over the Vision

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
The United Nations General Assembly meeting today was to have been a rare moment when the quest to relieve the crushing poverty of a billion people took center stage. But so far that goal has been overshadowed by Katrina, the oil-for-food scandal and squabbling over reform of the United Nations itself.
 Even the debate about the world's common agenda on global poverty began on an unexpectedly sour note, centered around the goals for healing the world's deepest poverty that were to be in the meeting's final document.
 The American ambassador, John R. Bolton, initially proposed expunging any reference to specific goals for reducing poverty, hunger and child mortality and combating pandemics of AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. 
 Known as the millennium development goals, they emerged from a United Nations conference five years ago. He favored instead citing the broad declaration from which the goals were drawn. 
 The United States subsequently relented, but not before the administration's opening foray in the negotiations left some African leaders dismayed. 
 ''The thing that shocked me personally was that they're trying to shift and change goal posts,'' said Charity Kaluki Ngilu, the Kenyan health minister, who is in New York for the meeting. ''If this is the case, we African leaders might as well go home and find other methods of developing ourselves.''
 Mrs. Ngilu, who said she was stunned by the Bush administration's initial position, added that nonetheless, she credits Mr. Bush's anti-AIDS program with helping Kenya to increase the number of people being treated for the disease to 45,000, from 2,000.
 Administration officials say Mr. Bush has a vision and a record to offer on development. But as of yesterday, with presidents and prime ministers from more than 170 nations converging on New York, he had yet to put his personal stamp on the debate. 
 He will undoubtedly address the challenges of fighting global poverty when he speaks today at the United Nations. 
 But some say he has missed an opportunity to take the lead on poverty -- an issue of looming concern in much of the world -- even when America itself is preoccupied by terrorism, the war in Iraq and the aftermath of the hurricane. 
 At the same time, negotiations at the United Nations got absorbed by the issues around United Nations reform.
 ''It's a failure of the tactical and policy process inside the administration, perhaps because of distractions,'' said Nancy Birdsall, the founding president of the Center for Global Development in Washington. ''It suggests these development issues aren't that high on the agenda. The administration hasn't seized the moment.''
 Bush administration officials disagree. They say the United States is taking a strong lead. They noted that Laura Bush will be attending an event today in New York to highlight American support to African countries fighting malaria.
 John A. Simon, senior director for development at the National Security Council, said the administration's priority had been the substance of the summit meeting, not perceptions. 
 Officials want to be sure that the final document reflects the president's view that development is about more than the amount of aid rich countries provide to poor ones, but also about good government, sound economic policies and private sector growth.
 They also wanted to make it plain that the administration, while agreeing on the need for increased aid, has not and will not promise to give 70 cents of every $100 of national income, as European nations have recently done, with timetables for achieving that level of aid. 
 ''If we do the right things from a policy perspective, the results will speak for themselves,'' Mr. Simon said yesterday in an e-mail message.
 But advocates of the target insist that the United States had already committed to moving toward it in 2002, when Mr. Bush supported a declaration at a summit meeting in Monterrey, Mexico, saying rich countries would ''make concrete efforts'' to give 0.7 percent of national income in aid. 
 The United States, the world's largest donor in terms of value, is next to last among richer nations in giving as a share of national income. 
 In the current negotiations, Mr. Bolton first proposed dropping all references to the target, but later said it could be restored.
 The administration's approach and the haggling over the final document contrasts with the way Prime Minister Tony Blair pushed his agenda to alleviate poverty in Africa before the July meeting of the Group of 8 major industrial nations. 
 Mr. Blair lobbied each leader beforehand. He collaborated with Sir Bob Geldof, the former Boomtown Rats singer, to build public support. 
 And when the terror bombings in London struck during the Group of 8 talks, Mr. Blair kept them focused on Africa. 
 He emerged with a commitment from the eight nations to double aid to Africa, to $50 billion a year, by 2010.
 It is not clear that much new will emerge at the United Nations. World leaders are likely to affirm their commitment to push forward with the millennium goals to halve extreme poverty and hunger, cut child mortality by two-thirds and ensure the basic education of each child by 2015, among other things. 
 Those are the same broad goals agreed to five years ago.
 Whatever the verdict on Mr. Bush's role, others are seizing the initiative. Former president Bill Clinton will sponsor a three-day conference in New York beginning tomorrow that will focus on poverty and governing, climate change and conflict. 
 Among those listed as confirmed participants are Mr. Blair, President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria and Sonia Gandhi, who leads the governing Congress Party in India.
 Jeffrey D. Sachs, an economist who headed the United Nation's Millennium Project and is the author of ''The End of Poverty,'' is developing a new organization called Millennium Promise to test his antipoverty ideas in 100 African villages. MTV will broadcast a documentary today, ''The Diary of Angelina Jolie and Dr. Jeffrey Sachs in Africa,'' that recounts their trip to one such village in Kenya.
 At a screening on Monday evening at the Museum of Television and Radio, Professor Sachs said of the coming United Nations meeting, ''Maybe what we've got to do is lead by action, and the government will follow along.'' Ms. Jolie, looking every inch the movie star in a figure-hugging black dress, said, ''Europe has stepped up, but America should take the lead, or at least more of a lead.''

HEADLINE: Dancers Are Given Only a Few Days to Create a Site-Specific Work

BYLINE: By DANIEL J. WAKIN

 BODY:
One by one, five dancers staggered through an archway and lurched drunkenly across the concrete floor. They came together, split apart and a bit later slithered, gabbling, face-first across the brick wall. 
 The dull hum of traffic, punctuated by the clack-clack of cars crossing a bridge, filled the air. The choreographer Tere O'Connor, in baggy pants and a black T-shirt, looked pensive as he surveyed his work in the latest offering from Dancing in the Streets, a nonprofit producer of site-specific performances. 
The organization has commissioned five choreographers to present 5- to 10-minute works under stuntlike conditions: they were informed after midnight Sunday, by e-mail, of the performance's location. They have until Saturday to come up with a dance.
 All but one arrived on Monday, gazing about and sniffing the creative possibilities at the site, a triangular, roofless section of the 1870's-era tobacco warehouses at Empire-Fulton Ferry State Park in Brooklyn. The Brooklyn Bridge rose overhead. Glorious views of Manhattan, the East River and the Manhattan Bridge were visible through arched windows and doors. A local historian, landscape architects and the show's artistic director, Joanna Haigood, briefed the choreographers. Reporters were told the location ahead of time but were asked to keep it secret. 
 Imagine ''Mission Impossible'' in tights.
 But there were serious artistic purposes here. Performances in unusual places force audiences to see and appreciate the surroundings in a new light, Ms. Haigood said. The short deadline is a way to inspire choreographers and help them gain new perspective on their creative paths.
 ''This is really an opportunity to examine your own process and see what bubbles up,'' Ms. Haigood told the choreographers. She said she hoped they would feel ''invigorated and inspired.''
 When asked about site-specific performances, dance historians like to say that people have danced outdoors since the dawn of humanity. But as a contemporary art form, they came of age in the 1960's and 70's. They are distinct from most outdoor performances in that the area -- its history or physical characteristics -- shapes the content of the dance.
 In this case, the short-term format was also an economical way of bringing an array of prominent choreographers into one show, said Aviva Davidson, the executive director of Dancing in the Streets.
 The project is called ''Breaking Ground: A Dance Charrette,'' a reference to the French carts in which 19th-century Parisian architecture students would rush their sketches back to school after being given a 72-hour deadline.
 Conversations with the choreographers shed light on how they come up with ideas, and how one location can evoke different responses.
 Mr. O'Connor said it usually takes him four to five months to create a dance work. 
 ''So this is very quick,'' he said. ''But you face the same questions. What is this? What is this going to become? How am I going to create something out of nothing?'' The difference, he said, is that there is little pressure to produce something of high quality. 
 The movements on display Monday would very likely not be in his piece, Mr. O'Connor said. ''Working is like dabbing. You dab and dab and paint over until you find something,'' he said. ''It's a process of locating something.'' 
 The first element that struck him was how sunny the area was. ''I don't like the sun,'' he said. So he began by lining his dancers up along a strip of shadow, which grew larger as the day went on. ''I was responding to the heat,'' he said.
 Jawole Willa Jo Zollar, the founder of Urban Bush Women, arrived later in the day. She strode onto the grounds and looked closely at the walls, her eyes continually drawn to the second-floor windows. ''I want to figure out how to use these windows here,'' she said to no one in particular. 
 Larry Keigwin -- like Mr. O'Connor, a newcomer to site-specific dance -- said he had originally envisioned a pastoral setting and sought out images of animals for inspiration. That idea immediately dissolved when he saw the red-brick walls and concrete floor of the old warehouse. 
 Now, he said, he was drawn to the converging lines of the walls that created the point of the triangle: an architectural vanishing point. The urban setting brought cellphones to mind. Maybe each dancer could brandish them? ''I immediately thought I wanted to make an urban painting,'' he said.
 The choreographic team known as Eiko & Koma, who have long experience in site-specific dance, appeared more nonchalant. 
 ''It's a very simple structure, so I am thinking of a simple, one movement,'' Koma said. Maybe something like putting a cigarette in one's mouth, given the ghosts of the tobacco trade, he said. Eiko later suggested she might bring a portrait of herself and move it along the wall, to convey the idea of an archetype of a person who may have lived and worked there. (Large paintings have figured in their work before.) Or maybe she would not, Eiko said. 
 One choreographer, Ann Carlson, is due to arrive on Friday. She received an information packet and a videotape of the orientation session.
 The performances are scheduled for 2 and 4 p.m. on Saturday, rain or shine, and they are free. 
 The ''Mission Impossible'' idea brought its challenges. If no one knows the location until a week before, how do you advertise? The leaders of Dancing in the Streets said they sent out thousands of postcards last month announcing the event and date, and sending people to their Web site, www.dancinginthestreets.org, for details. They said they expected 1,000 people for the two performances.
 The idea was suggested by Ms. Haigood, a San Francisco-based choreographer who, with her Zaccho Dance Theater, performed a work of aerial dancing at an abandoned grain elevator in Red Hook three years ago.
 She and Ms. Davidson mapped out the project on a napkin during a dinner at Carmine's in Midtown last February. The Brooklyn Bridge Park Conservancy, which coordinates special events at the warehouse, gave its approval, helping to cut through the usual red tape for performances in a public place.

HEADLINE: Families at the Bottom

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Broken Yardstick'' (Op-Ed, Sept. 9):
 Nicholas Eberstadt, after writing that the spending of the bottom fifth of Americans was more than double its income, writes, ''Unfortunately, economists and statisticians have yet to come up with a clear explanation for this gap.''
The simple explanation for this statistic is that lower income Americans must increasingly go into debt just to meet essential needs.
 ''Fixed costs'' -- mortgages, child care, health insurance, vehicles and taxes -- now take up 75 percent of today's average two-income family, compared with 50 percent in the early 1970's. 
 Families in the bottom fifth, without access to traditional banks, must turn to the predatory lenders of the fringe economy to make ends meet, and a large percentage of their expenditures serve only to finance their debts. 
 It is becoming increasingly expensive to be poor in America.

HEADLINE: When Food From the Laboratory Leaves a Bitter Taste

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
The heroes and villains in ''The Future of Food,'' Deborah Koons Garcia's sober, far-reaching polemic against genetically modified foods, are clearly identified. The good guys, acknowledged in the film's cursory final segment, are organic farmers along with a growing network of farmers' markets around the United States that constitute a grass-roots resistance to the Goliath of agribusiness and the genetically engineered products it favors. 
 The bad guys, to whom this quietly inflammatory film devotes the bulk of its attention, are large corporations, especially the Monsanto Company, a pioneer in the development of genetically engineered agricultural products. In recent years, Monsanto has patented seeds that yield crops whose chemical structures have been modified to ward off pests. 
The film poses many ticklish ethical and scientific questions:
 Since genetic material is life, should corporations have the right to patent genes?
 What are the long-term effects on humans of consuming genetically engineered food, which is still largely unlabeled in the United States?
 Can the crossbreeding of wild and genetically modified plants be controlled?
 Might genetically engineered food be the answer to world hunger? 
 And finally, could the reduction of biodiversity, which has quickened since the introduction of genetically modified plants, lead to catastrophe? 
 The film's answers to these five questions are: No. Possibly damaging. Probably not. Probably not. Possibly. 
 In each case, the movie outlines the pluses, the minuses and the imponderables. But the overall attitude of Ms. Garcia, the widow of the Grateful Dead guitarist Jerry Garcia, might be summed up with the scolding slogan ''It's not nice to fool Mother Nature.'' 
 Much of the film is devoted to Monsanto's prosecution of Canadian farmers on whose property the company discovered traces of its patented Roundup Ready canola seed, which is genetically engineered to kill pests. Though the seed had drifted accidentally onto the farmers' land, courts ruled that they had violated Monsanto's patent and were liable for damages. 
 The film begins with a capsule history of agriculture going back more than 12,000 years but concentrating on the 20th century. It traces the development of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, the rise and fall of the green revolution, its morphing into the gene revolution, and the implanting of natural bacterial toxins into the cells of corn. Can wheat be far behind?
 In the mid-1990's, Monsanto, the DuPont Company and others bought the seed industry. Monsanto alone spent $8 billion investing in the notion that, as the film bluntly puts it, ''whoever controls the seeds controls the food.'' 
 Monsanto has even developed a ''suicide seed'' that makes crops kill themselves after one planting. What might happen, the film wonders, if this seed mixed with wild seeds? 
 The movie wags its finger at the hand-in-hand relationship of multinational corporations and big government. One of the film's more unsettling revelations is its identification of the connections between Monsanto and top government officials who have been board members, consultants and executives for its subsidiaries. As a result, the movie insinuates, the government has little interest in underwriting research into the promotion of biodiversity and other alternatives to the economic goals of agribusiness. 
 The movie ends on a tentative upbeat note. It visits farmers' markets where the organically grown tomatoes look so inviting you want to pluck them off the screen and slice them into your own scrumptious B.L.T. We see whole-earth-style advocates carrying signs that read, ''Our children are not lab rats.'' Goliath, we are assured, still has a way to go before trampling all the Davids armed with slingshots.

The Future of Food
Opens today in Manhattan.

HEADLINE: Suit Says Wal-Mart Is Lax On Labor Abuses Overseas 

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
A labor rights group filed a class-action lawsuit yesterday against Wal-Mart Stores in which apparel workers in Bangladesh, China and other countries assert that Wal-Mart violated its contractual obligations by not enforcing its code of conduct for overseas contractors.
 The lawsuit, filed in state court in Los Angeles, makes the novel argument that Wal-Mart's code of conduct created contractual obligations between it and thousands of workers employed by contractors who were supposed to comply with the code.
In the lawsuit brought by the International Labor Rights Fund, workers from Bangladesh, China, Indonesia, Nicaragua and Swaziland assert that the codes of conduct were violated in dozens of ways. They said they were often paid less than the minimum wage and did not receive time-and-a-half for overtime, and some said they were beaten by managers and were locked in their factories. 
 ''Based on its vast economic power, Wal-Mart, based on its code of conduct, can and does control the working conditions of its supplier factories,'' the lawsuit states. ''It could use its power and position to prevent its producers from profiting from the inhumane treatment of plaintiffs.''
 Beth Keck, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman, said the company was studying the lawsuit. ''It's really too early for us to go into any kind of detail about this complaint,'' Ms. Keck said. ''It involves a number of countries, suppliers and factories. We will be looking into this and taking it very seriously.''
 Wal-Mart executives say that they have the world's largest overseas monitoring program, with more than 5,000 factories inspected by 200 full-time inspectors who visit 30 factories a day. The executives say that when inspectors find violations, they give factories several months to fix any problems before another inspection. 
 Last year, according to the company's ethical standards report, Wal-Mart cut off 1,200 factories for at least 90 days because serious violations were found in the second visit. Another 108 factories were permanently banned, primarily because of child-labor violations. 
 In the lawsuit, two male workers for Wal-Mart contractors in Shenzhen, China, asserted that they were not paid the minimum wage, not permitted to take holidays off and were forced to work overtime. They said the contractors withheld the first three months of all workers' pay, almost making them indentured servants because the company refused to pay the money if they quit. 
 An apparel worker in Dhaka, Bangladesh, said that she was locked into the factory and did not have a day off in her first six months. She said that she was told if she refused to work the required overtime, she would be fired. Another worker said her supervisor attacked her ''by slapping her face so hard that her nose began bleeding simply because she was unable to meet'' her ''high quota.''
 The complaint tells the stories of 16 plaintiffs, but lists them as John and Jane Does, saying they need to be protected against reprisal. Several said they were fired or suspended for backing unions. 
 The lawsuit accuses Wal-Mart of breach of contract for wage violations, forced labor and denying workers the right to associate freely. It also accuses the company of negligence, unjust enrichment and fraudulent and deceptive practices in violating California's business code.
 Terry Collingsworth, executive director of the International Labor Rights Fund, a Washington-based advocacy group, asserted that filing the lawsuit in California was appropriate because Wal-Mart had violated that state's laws. He said that if the plaintiffs had filed the lawsuit in their home countries, they would have faced arrest, physical attacks and hostile judicial systems that favored corporations.
 He faulted Wal-Mart's monitoring system, contending that fewer than 10 percent of its inspections were unannounced. He said company managers often coach workers on what to tell the inspectors.
 Wal-Mart executives say that they are working to improve the monitoring and that more inspections will be unannounced. 
 ''With our growth, the challenge of ethical sourcing has become increasingly complex,'' H. Lee Scott Jr., Wal-Mart's chief executive, wrote in the company's 2004 Report on Standards for Suppliers. ''But we have a qualified ethical standards team dedicated to verifying that factories are in compliance with local labor laws and/or Wal-Mart standards, whichever are more stringent.''
 An Indonesian plaintiff who said she made jackets for Wal-Mart's private-label George line complained of unpaid work hours and unpaid overtime, saying that she often worked from 7 a.m. until 8 or 10 p.m. Mondays through Fridays. She said she also had to work on Saturdays from 7:30 a.m. until 3 or 4 p.m.
 Another Indonesian worker said, ''Wal-Mart production quotas were far higher than quotas from previous buyers, and her supervisor regularly yelled at her and her colleagues if the work was not performed quickly enough.''
 An apparel worker in Matsapha, Swaziland, said he sometimes had to work from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. and once worked all night. ''He was threatened with immediate dismissal if he did not work overtime, and the factory doors were locked to ensure he did not leave,'' the lawsuit asserted. 
 Mr. Scott wrote in the ethical standards report, ''It is important to recognize the reality that however strong the programs we develop, violations of our standards will occur.'' He added that it was a point of pride with Wal-Mart when violations were discovered, action was taken. 
 The plaintiffs include four unionized California supermarket workers who say that they suffered cuts in pay and benefits because of competition from Wal-Mart's low prices. They argue that those prices are attributable in part to violations of the chain's suppliers' code of conduct.

HEADLINE: Bush Puts Iraq, China and Iran on Agenda 

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

 BODY:
For the first time since the Hurricane Katrina crisis, President Bush returned yesterday to dealing with festering global problems, trying to bolster Iraq's president at the White House and then flying to New York to urge President Hu Jintao of China to join him in trying to stop nuclear programs in Iran and North Korea.
 Mr. Bush's meeting with Mr. Hu was delayed a week by the hurricane, and was the first in a series planned for coming months, including a trip by Mr. Bush to China in November. 
When the session finally took place yesterday at the Waldorf-Astoria, Mr. Bush was lobbying hard to persuade Mr. Hu -- who has nurtured a close relationship with Iran -- not to block action by the International Atomic Energy Agency next week to refer Iran's work on uranium enrichment to the Security Council.
 ''We didn't come away with a clear commitment,'' Michael J. Green, the top official for Asia in the National Security Council, said yesterday evening. But he added that Mr. Hu had agreed to urge Iran to follow the mandates of the I.A.E.A.
 Nuclear issues, trade and Taiwan dominated the meeting at the Waldorf, before Mr. Bush held a reception for more than 170 world leaders who have gathered for the opening of the United Nations General Assembly and a meeting on global poverty.
 Mr. Bush's aides also turned over to Mr. Hu a list of human rights cases that particularly concern the United States, Mr. Green said. While they declined to describe most of those cases, Mr. Green said one involved Zhao Yan, a researcher for The New York Times in Beijing, who has been accused of leaking state secrets to the newspaper. Mr. Zhao and The Times have denied the accusation, and Mr. Zhao has had no court hearing or any public explanation of why he was arrested. 
 Earlier yesterday, at a news conference in Washington with President Jalal Talabani of Iraq, Mr. Bush expressed some impatience with Iran's defiance of an agreement it reached last year with three European nations. 
 ''Some of us are wondering why they need civilian nuclear power anyway,'' Mr. Bush said. ''They're awash with hydrocarbons. Nevertheless, it's a right of a government to want to have a civilian nuclear program.''
 Mr. Bush's aides insisted later in the day that the president was not, with that last statement, signaling a greater willingness to allow either Iran or North Korea to acquire what both have said is their right: control over the complete nuclear fuel cycle, the path to making fuel for either civilian reactors or weapons. Mr. Bush explicitly said Iran's nuclear program should develop ''in such a way that they don't gain the expertise necessary to be able to enrich.'' 
 But his comments were far milder than they were three years ago, when Mr. Bush first called Iran and North Korea part of an ''axis of evil.'' 
 Instead, Mr. Green said, Mr. Hu and Mr. Bush talked about ways to pressure North Korea to make what Mr. Green called ''a strategic decision'' to give up its weapons programs. 
 Talks on North Korea resumed in Beijing yesterday, with North Korea repeating, as Iran has, that it has a right to develop its own civilian nuclear programs. 
 While Mr. Hu and Mr. Bush carefully chose words to show their agreement on the issue -- ''We have always stood for a nuclear-weapon-free Korean Peninsula,'' Mr. Hu said -- some administration officials say they are increasingly concerned that the United States and Tokyo are pursuing one approach, and Beijing and South Korea are pursuing another.
 The United States has made full disarmament of North Korea its priority. But both the Chinese and the South Koreans have spoken of the need to assure ''stability'' in North Korea, a code word for making sure that the North Korean government does not collapse.
 At moments, the meeting with the Chinese had echoes of the kind of meetings Mr. Bush's father used to hold with Japan in the late 1980's when he was trying to lower a fast-widening trade deficit with Japan and used to travel to Tokyo to urge Japan, when its economy seemed to be growing without limit, to pay heed to the damage being done to American workers.
 Mr. Hu was ready for that. 
 ''What I would like to express here is that China does not pursue a huge trade surplus in its trade with the United States,'' he said. ''And we are willing to work with the United States to take effective measures to increase China's imports from the United States.'' 
 The last statement was especially significant, because Mr. Hu steered clear of committing to any restraints in exports to the United States. 
 The issue may become even more heated if Hurricane Katrina leads to a downturn in American economic growth. Some of the affected industries in the south compete with Chinese companies, and were already calling for greater government protection. 
 The earlier meeting with Mr. Talabani was notable for the Iraqi leader's change of tone on an issue important to Mr. Bush: setting any parameters for the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq. 
 On Friday in Washington, Mr. Talabani said he believed that American troops would be required for two years. The Washington Post reported Monday that he had said he thought 40,000 to 50,000 American troops could be withdrawn by the end of the year. But yesterday, he recited the White House talking points: that it was impossible, and unwise, to set a deadline. ''We will set no timetable for withdrawal, Mr. President,'' he said to Mr. Bush.

Michael Jackson's Lineup
 Michael Jackson has enlisted Mariah Carey, below, Snoop Dogg, Jay-Z and James Brown to perform on the recording he plans to make to raise money for victims of Hurricane Katrina, Reuters reported. Mr. Jackson's spokeswoman, Raymone Bain, said that others involved would include Lenny Kravitz, Wyclef Jean, Lauryn Hill, Missy Elliott, Mary J. Blige, Ciara, R. Kelly, Kenneth Edmonds (or Babyface) and Yolanda Adams. In the mid-1980's, Mr. Jackson helped to raise more than $60 million for African famine relief with ''We Are the World,'' written with Lionel Richie. Radio City Music Hall is joining Madison Square Garden as a site for the all-star concert ''From the Big Apple to the Big Easy'' to benefit Hurricane Katrina relief on Tuesday. Scheduled to appear at Radio City, among others, are Dave Matthews, Tom Waits, Trey Anastasio and Joss Stone. Tickets for the Radio City concert go on sale tomorrow through Ticketmaster, (212)307-7171. 

Club Gigs Suit Chappelle
 Dave Chappelle, below, who turned his back on a third season of his popular Comedy Central series, ''Chappelle's Show,'' says he is delighted to be doing stand-up comedy in clubs, The Associated Press reported. Mr. Chappelle recently sold out 10 shows at the 325-seat Funny Bone Comedy Club at Newport on the Levee, in Newport, Ky., across the Ohio River from Cincinnati. He said such gigs were ''like I'm hanging out with a bunch of people.'' As for his future, Mr. Chappelle, who has a home on a 65-acre farm in Yellow Springs, Ohio, about 65 miles northeast of Cincinnati, told The Cincinnati Enquirer: ''That's a good question. Is 'I don't know' an acceptable answer?''

Montreal Symphony Strike
 The Montreal Symphony Orchestra has canceled the first four concerts of its new season as the musicians continue the strike they began in May, The Canadian Press reported. ''The management of the Montreal Symphony Orchestra is sorry for the inconvenience caused by these cancellations,'' the board said in a statement after a meeting on Friday, when it concluded that a settlement was unlikely to come in time to proceed with the concerts. The performances were to be given from Sept. 20 to Sept. 28. The musicians are seeking improved salaries and better working conditions; the board wants a settlement that would reflect what it says are the economic realities of the orchestra, which is operating at a deficit.

Suge Knight's Assets Frozen
 The assets of the rap impresario Marion Knight, called Suge, right, have been frozen by a California judge in a marital dispute, The Associated Press reported. The freeze was ordered by Judge Adrienne M. Grover of Monterey County Superior Court on Aug. 29 after she decided that Mr. Knight and his lawyers had failed to answer questions and provide information in the dispute, between Lydia Harris and her husband, Michael, who is serving 28 years in San Quentin State Prison. In March a Los Angeles judge ordered Mr. Knight, the co-founder and chief executive of Death Row Records, and his companies to pay $107 million to Ms. Harris, who said that she had helped start the label and that it owed her money. Mr. Harris said he put up $1.5 million from behind bars in 1991 to help start the company, a contention repeatedly denied by Mr. Knight. Mr. Harris filed for divorce in June, after learning that his wife was in settlement negotiations with Mr. Knight, Mr. Harris's lawyer, Steven M. Goldberg, said. Calls to lawyers for Mr. Knight and Ms. Harris were not immediately returned, the news agency said.

London Honors Pavarotti
 Luciano Pavarotti, above right, has been granted the Freedom of the City of London in recognition of his humanitarian work with the Red Cross, The Associated Press reported. The largely symbolic honor was first bestowed in 1237 and allowed recipients to trade within the commercial center of London. It formerly carried the right to drive sheep across London Bridge and to be hanged with a silken cord if given the death penalty. In honor of his achievements as a musician and ambassador for the blues, B.B. King was given a Living Legend medal by the librarian of Congress, James H. Billington, in ceremonies at the library in Washington on Monday. Mr. King also recorded an interview for the oral history archives of the American Folklife Center, helping to begin a multiyear celebration of creativity in America.

Los Angeles Opera To Help Young Singers
 Placido Domingo, below, the general director of the Los Angeles Opera, has announced the creation of the Domingo-Thornton Young Artist Program. Named in recognition of a $2 million gift from the Flora L. Thornton Foundation, the program is intended to develop young singers of potentially international stature whose first loyalty would be to the Los Angeles Opera. Mr. Domingo said, ''In recalling the challenges of providing for my family while bearing the costs of music and voice lessons during my early career, I know only too well the importance of special support for full-time study and the freedom to take advantage of performing opportunities.''

HEADLINE: Dealers Smuggle Weapons Into Gaza From Egypt 

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: RAFAH, Gaza Strip, Sept. 14 

 BODY:
Palestinian gunrunners smuggled hundreds of assault rifles and pistols across the Egyptian frontier into Gaza, dealers and border officials said Wednesday. The influx confirmed Israeli fears about giving up border control and could further destabilize Gaza.
 Black market prices for weapons dropped sharply, with the price of AK-47 assault rifles nearly cut in half, to $1,300, and even steeper reductions for handguns. 
 The Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, has tried to impose order since the Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza on Monday, but militant groups scoffed at a new demand by the Palestinian Authority that they must disband after parliamentary elections in January, saying they would not surrender their weapons.
 Israel voiced concern about chaos along the Egypt-Gaza border in the three days since its pullout, sending messages to the United States, Egypt and the Palestinians. ''We will not put up with this,'' Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz said.
 Egypt had assured Israel that it would prevent weapons smuggling once its troops took over from Israel along the Gaza frontier, and Cairo and the Palestinian Authority pledged to seal the border by Wednesday evening. Thousands had crossed unhindered since Monday.
 Around 8 p.m. Wednesday, about two hours after the deadline for closing the border, an Egyptian officer bellowed into a bullhorn for Palestinians to stop entering Egypt and prepare to return to Gaza.
 The frontier was still porous later, however, with the Egyptian police pushing back Palestinians scaling the wall on the Gaza side and trying to sneak through the barbed-wire fence on the Egyptian side. Up to 750 Egyptian border guards were expected Thursday, the police said.
 Palestinian security forces in Gaza appeared to be doing little to stop infiltrators. At midday, Hamas militants blew a hole in the Gaza wall, making it even easier for people to enter the 18-foot-wide buffer zone leading to Egypt's fence.
 One arms dealer, interviewed in a car outside the Rafah cemetery, said hundreds of AK-47's had been smuggled from Egypt since Monday. He said he sold his guns to militants but declined to say how many pieces his runners brought back.
 Another dealer said competitors reported having $1 million worth of loot confiscated, including grenade launchers.

Two Airlines, Delta and Northwest, File for Bankruptcy Court Protection
Northwest, the nation's fifth-largest airline, filed for bankruptcy protection, a step taken simultaneously by Delta Air Lines, the country's third-largest carrier. The twin filings -- whose coincidence was not planned, the airlines' chief executives said -- mean that half the seats on flights in the United States are offered by airlines operating under court protection. [Page C1.]

Air travelers reacted to two new airline bankruptcy filings the same way they greeted earlier decisions by United Airlines and US Airways to seek Chapter 11 protection: with resignation. [C4.]

By filing for bankruptcy yesterday, Northwest Airlines expects to make the federal government an unsecured creditor for a $65 million contribution to its pension fund that was coming due today. [C4.]

Lawmakers to Look at F.D.A. Scrutiny of Medical Devices
Two federal lawmakers, Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa and Representative Edward Markey of Massachusetts, left, said they planned to increase their scrutiny of how the Food and Drug Administration monitors the safety of critical medical devices like heart defibrillators and pacemakers once they are on the market. In separate statements, they criticized what they described as the F.D.A.'s failure to alert the public to data about product problems. [C13.]

An advisory panel to the Food and Drug Administration recommended approval of the Celgene drug Revlimid as a treatment for a potentially fatal blood disorder. Revlimid is a modified version of thalidomide, a drug that caused serious birth defects decades ago but has been sold since 1998 by Celgene under the name Thalomid. [C13.]

Asbestos Trust Bars Payments in a Block of Claims
The Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust, one of the oldest and largest trusts set up to compensate victims of asbestos exposure, has barred payments to claimants who rely on reports by nine doctors and three X-ray screening companies. The named doctors are responsible for tens of thousands of claims submitted to the trust. The move is a response to growing concern that some of the claims the trust receives are not valid and may even be fraudulent. [C1.]

Gasoline Demand Falls for a Second Week
Demand for gasoline fell nationwide for a second consecutive week, the government reported, indicating that record retail prices may have forced some consumers to cut back on their driving over the week of Labor Day. [C8.]

The Oil Industry's Storm Watch
Around the world, offshore oil and gas platforms are generally built to survive a so-called 100-year storm without serious damage. Then Hurricane Katrina struck. ''We're seeing more 100-year events happening more often, even every few years,'' one designer of offshore platforms said. ''The bar has to be higher.'' [C1.]

Lawyers Begin Arguments in 2nd Vioxx Trial
Lawyers in an Atlantic City court presented opening arguments in the second personal injury suit against Merck over its painkiller Vioxx to reach a jury. The case comes to trial almost one month after a Texas jury ordered Merck to pay $253 million to the widow of a man who died after taking Vioxx for eight months. Many documents and arguments used in Texas will play a role in the New Jersey case. [C1.]

Another Union Says It Will Leave Labor Federation
Unite Here, a union that represents apparel, hotel, casino and restaurant workers, announced that it was quitting the A.F.L.-C.I.O. labor federation, becoming the fourth union to do so this summer. [A14.]

Google Stock Sale Raises $4.18 Billion
Google raised $4.18 billion in a secondary offering, as investors tried to add to their holdings of a stock that has more than tripled in value since the company's initial offering a year ago. Market Place. [C13.]

Rise in Oil Prices Pushes Stocks Lower
A sharp rise in oil prices sent stocks sliding as new data showed that high energy prices have started to slow the economy. The Nasdaq composite index fell 22.42 points, to 2,149.33. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 52.54 points, to 10,544.90, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slid 4.04 points, to 1,227.16. [C7.]

European Carmakers Remain Skeptical About Hybrids
Europe's automobile industry has bowed to the popularity of gasoline-electric hybrids, with announcements by leading German carmakers that they would follow Toyota's lead. But behind the scenes, Europe's auto executives remain privately skeptical, even dismissive, about hybrid technology. [C6.]

Sony Takes Wraps Off a New Kind of Walkman
Last week, hours after Apple Computer rolled out its newest iPod model, the Nano, in California, Sony unveiled what it hopes will be an iPod-killer in Tokyo. The line of sleek new digital music devices bears the venerable Walkman name, but offers iPod-like features. [C6.]

The Microsoft Corporation plans to announce at the Tokyo Game Show that it will begin selling its new video game console, the Xbox 360, on Nov. 22. [C13.]

HEADLINE: Venting Ideas, Then Hiding Them, Turns Out to Be a Tall Order

BYLINE: By David W. Dunlap

 BODY:
FOR a moment, don't think of the World Trade Center memorial plaza as hallowed ground. Or as ground at all.
 Think of it as a roof.
That is how the memorial plaza will function; as the roof of an enormous underground complex including memorial galleries, the memorial museum, loading bays, passageways, cooling equipment and the PATH terminal. 
 That will require a lot of ventilation shafts. And not just simple grilles set into the pavement. For security reasons, these vents generally must be 40 feet high -- that is, as tall as a four-story house.
 An idea of their dimension can be had in the Hudson River Park, at Morton Street, where two 46-foot shafts emerge from the PATH tunnels below. Though architectural imagination went into cloaking these shafts and park visitors gravitate to the shade and seating around them, they are still big and forbidding. 
 Imagine the memorial plaza filled with a dozen such structures and you can understand why planners at ground zero are working hard to find alternative locations for the shafts there.
 ''My expectation, my hope is that we'll remove all these encumbrances from the site,'' said John P. Cahill, Gov. George E. Pataki's chief of staff and the top-ranking downtown development official. ''The soul of our rebuilding efforts is the memorial.''
 Arguably, this behind-the-scenes engineering and design effort has a greater bearing on the integrity of the future memorial -- designed by Michael Arad of Handel Architects and Peter Walker & Partners, in association with Davis Brody Bond -- than the current fight over the tenancy of the cultural building.
 The memorial plaza is envisioned as a ''flat plane interrupted only by two reflecting pools,'' filled with swamp white oak and sweet gum trees, said Stefan Pryor, president of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. ''All parties remain committed to that vision.''
 Until recently, however, that vision was competing with the possibility that vent shafts would rise directly upward from the underground complex. Citing security, officials would not discuss the exact location, number or dimensions.
 Government guidelines for securing buildings from chemical, biological and radiological attacks emphasize that air intakes must be high above ground, preferably four stories, to lessen the chance that a terrorist could lob a device in. They also urge that the area around shafts be kept clear of anything -- like trees -- that could give terrorists a foothold or obscure security guards' views of the structures.
 Not that plantings near the shafts would have been desirable, anyway. ''They vent cold air in summer and hot air in winter,'' said Anne Papageorge, senior vice president of the development corporation, ''so it creates microclimates that are not necessarily the best climate for the health of the trees.''
 Images of 40-foot shafts have never appeared on any rendering of the memorial that the public has seen. Officials had begun studying ways to move the shafts but a model prepared for internal use, showing the plaza peppered with vents, helped focus their attention. They now estimate that 80 to 90 percent of the potentially intrusive shafts have been relocated.
 Some shafts will be incorporated within -- and disguised by -- structures like the cultural building at the northeast corner of the plaza and the museum entrance pavilion on the west. Others might sit on the West Street-Route 9A median. Because there are no structures at the southeast corner of the plaza, relocating the shafts there has posed the greatest challenge, Mr. Cahill said. 
 Planners are therefore casting their eyes to parcels outside the memorial quadrant. Some shafts might run through the commercial buildings known as Tower 3 and Tower 4 on Church Street. There is also a possibility of running them through Tower 5, on the site of the former Deutsche Bank building, at 130 Liberty Street, said Charles J. Maikish, the executive director of the Lower Manhattan Construction Command Center. 
 And Kenneth J. Ringler Jr., the executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said the PATH terminal might house some ventilation shafts.
 Each solution carries its own complications. Costs increase as the route of the ductwork grows longer and more tortuous. If located in other buildings, the shafts would take floor area away from museum space or revenue-generating commercial space.
 ONE way or another, however, they must be accommodated. ''When you think about the thousands of people who could be below grade at any particular moment,'' Mr. Cahill said, ''the ability to provide for their public safety is of utmost importance.''
 Though the agencies may have begun with differing objectives -- the authority sought the most straightforward engineering solution, the corporation sought the most pristine plaza -- they are now ''working fantastically well together,'' Mr. Cahill said, adding, ''That has not always been the case.''
 Mr. Ringler said he expected that Anthony G. Cracchiolo and Steven P. Plate of the authority's priority capital programs office would find a way to relocate the last shafts from the plaza in the next few weeks. 
 ''I turn to my miracle workers,'' Mr. Ringler said. ''I say that half-jokingly, but there's no question it's a challenge.''
 At the corporation, Mr. Pryor sounded hopeful, too. ''Each of the parties,'' he said, ''is now engaged in that part of the process labeled 'trust but verify.'''

HEADLINE: Family Name In Brooklyn Loses Clout With Defeat

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
In Brooklyn, a borough with no shortage of political dynasties, the Boyland family name has been one of the most enduring. But in Tuesday's primary election, the family's electoral record suffered a rare blemish.
 For nearly 30 years, a member of the family has been in public office, with the patriarch, William F. Boyland Sr., serving the longest. He began a career in Albany in 1982 after the death of his brother, Assemblyman Thomas Boyland. William Boyland was a member of the Assembly for nearly 20 years, until he resigned in 2003 and engineered the succession of his son, William Jr. 
This year, his daughter, City Councilwoman Tracy L. Boyland, was barred by term limits from running for re-election. Her father, 65, decided to come out of retirement and seek the position, comparing his family to the Kennedys. But in an unusual defeat for a Boyland, he was beaten soundly on Tuesday in the Democratic primary by Darlene Mealy, a political newcomer who is a longtime employee of the New York City Transit Authority.
 In this heavily Democratic bastion of Brownsville and Ocean Hill, her victory is tantamount to election. Ms. Mealy, 40, helped to create a civic association in the district by stitching together several block associations and has been a strong voice in the area for improving public safety and promoting economic development.
 Her campaign was considered a long shot at first but received increasing support from an array of unions, politicians and political groups, including the Working Families Party.
 Ms. Mealy said yesterday that she could hardly believe she had come out ahead of nine other candidates in the most crowded Council primary in the city. ''Wow. It still doesn't seem real to me,'' she said in an interview before going fishing off a pier in southern Brooklyn. ''I just need to get away just for a little while to take it all in. I'm still in a kind of state of shock.''
 In unofficial results from the Board of Elections, Ms. Mealy had 47 percent of the votes; Mr. Boyland was second with 19 percent.
 Such a solid victory for Ms. Mealy over Mr. Boyland was particularly stunning to Brooklyn politicians, many of whom have benefited from the support of a formidable Boyland family political machine. 
 Ms. Mealy's campaign asserted that the Boyland family had become too out of touch with average residents in the district and too beholden to developers to effectively represent the interests of a largely working-class and poor district.
 She said that the Boyland family had accepted more than $100,000 in the last five years from developers at the same time that new housing created in the district was far too expensive for most residents -- $300,000 and $400,000 homes in a community with many public housing complexes.
 Her message apparently caught on. Workers joined the Mealy campaign from some of the city's powerful unions: 1199/S.E.I.U., the health care union; Local 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union, which represents janitors; and Unite Here, which represents hotel, restaurant and apparel workers.
 The Rev. Al Sharpton campaigned several times alongside Ms. Mealy in the 41st Council District. She also was endorsed by Representative Major Owens. (The other rare Boyland defeat came last year, when Tracy Boyland challenged Mr. Owens.)
 Ms. Mealy was not the only one who seemed stunned yesterday.
 ''The election results certainly came as a surprise to me,'' Mr. Boyland said in an interview. ''I knew they had an empire against me: the unions, Acorn, the Working Families Party, Major Owens, everybody and their mama,'' Mr. Boyland added.

HEADLINE: Job Rules of Carpenters' Union Encourage Corruption, U.S. Charges 

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Federal prosecutors have asked a judge to hold New York City's carpenters' union in contempt for changing the union's job referral system without government approval, arguing that the changes will encourage more corruption.
 The United States attorney in Manhattan, David N. Kelley, said in a motion that in changing the job referral system, the New York City District Council of Carpenters violated a consent decree it signed in 1994 in response to a federal effort to eliminate corruption. Prosecutors said the union was dominated by the Genovese crime family, and it was widely criticized for letting mob bosses pick carpenters to put up and take down displays at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. The consent decree requires the district council, which represents nearly 25,000 carpenters, to obtain federal approval before changing its job referral system. 
In court papers made public this week, Mr. Kelley argued that the changes give construction contractors far more leeway to hire whichever carpenters they want, irrespective of length of unemployment. The old system generally required them first to hire the carpenters who had been unemployed the longest. 
 Prosecutors say corruption will be easier under the new system because contractors will have more power to pressure unemployed carpenters to do their bidding.
 ''Because contractors can handpick virtually 100 percent of the work force at a job site, carpenters are now beholden to contractors for job opportunities,'' Mr. Kelley wrote. ''Carpenters who are at the mercy of employers for job assignments know that if they stand up for the enforcement of union rules or legal requirements or refuse to work off the books or for cash when asked by a contractor, they run the risk of being laid off.''
 Many contractors prefer paying workers off the books, he said, to avoid paying fringe benefits and to hide evidence that wages are below those required by the union contract.
 Mr. Kelley filed the contempt motion last month with Judge Charles S. Haight Jr. of United States District Court in Manhattan, who oversees the consent decree. The government also wants the district council's president, Peter Thomassen, cited for contempt. The union has until October to file its response.
 Gary Rothman, a lawyer for the council, defended the revamped system, saying it was part of a contract, signed in 2001, that is good for the city's carpenters.
 ''The employers wanted the ability to hire whom they want and when they want without restriction, and the union got a good deal out of it,'' Mr. Rothman said. ''They got a 25 3/4 percent increase over five years. That was a magnificent contract. The journeyman carpenter makes over $70 an hour with benefits.''
 Mr. Rothman questioned why prosecutors filed their contempt motion four years after the contract was signed. He defended Mr. Thomassen, saying he was just one member of a 20-person negotiating team. 
 The United States attorney's office declined to elaborate on the motion.
 Many rank-and-file carpenters say the current job referral system is unfair because it has left many of them unemployed for months at a time, while favored carpenters find steady work. 
 ''This new job request system is horrible,'' said Gregory Butler, a Harlem resident who has been in the union for 13 years. ''It's among the worst things that ever happened to us. They can get guys who work for cash. They can get guys to work for less than the regular rate.''
 Under union rules, companies must hire half of their carpenters from the union's out-of-work list. Before 2001 employers also had the right to give priority to unemployed workers who had worked for them in the previous six months. 
 But now employers can hire virtually anyone they want off the out-of-work list.

HEADLINE: In the Quarter, a Pool Serves as Gathering Place, Respite and Bathtub

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LUO

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS 

 BODY:
Behind the closed doors of a courtyard on Burgundy Street, next to a fallen pear tree and a collapsed wall, the famed bon temps of the French Quarter survive in a 30-foot aquamarine oval that looks like a mirage amid Hurricane Katrina's carnage: a swimming pool.
 Every day, holdouts in the Quarter gather here, sidestepping branches, bricks and other debris on the slate patio to swim, chat and escape.
''The best thing I've ever been able to do for people is to allow people to use this,'' said Richard S. Delahanty, 65, an unemployed stage manager from New York whose second-floor apartment overlooks the pool. 
 The pool belongs to a retired businessman who owns a 175-year-old rental compound that abuts it. But he lives in Georgia, and Mr. Delahanty and his dog, Sir Alexander Laird of Somerset, are the only remaining tenants, so Mr. Delahanty has made it his responsibility.
 ''I'm not the caretaker,'' he said. ''I'm taking care.''
 About a half-dozen guests gathered a little after 5 p.m. the other day. Dr. Stephen Mallernee, who works at Tulane University Medical Center, and his wife, Debbie, were making their first appearance poolside. Mrs. Mallernee plucked a bottle of raspberry Champagne from a pouch, and several glasses. Soon, bubbly was poured all around and the conversation flitted from who was responsible for the post-storm mess to whether Mardi Gras might still go on. 
 A short while later, Sukhdeo Doobay, a regular, arrived with Iko, a cockatoo from the Quarter who delights tourists by barking like a dog and singing, ''iko iko un-day,'' from the Mardi Gras tune.
 ''Isn't it amazing that amidst all this devastation around us, that there's a little bit of civilization, that there's a little bit of the flair of New Orleans?'' Mrs. Mallernee asked. ''Thank God.''
 The day after the storm hit, Mr. Delahanty let in a group of police officers, who stripped to their underwear and sat in the water up to their necks for about an hour-and-a-half, subdued because of their helplessness amid the growing chaos outside. 
 ''I felt bad for them,'' Mr. Delahanty said.
 Neighbors started trickling in the next day. Because there was no running water, the pool offered both a respite and a chance to bathe. Word of the oasis spread, and the number of visitors grew, until Mr. Delahanty decided to bar people he had not invited. 
 ''It was getting a little out of hand,'' he said.
 The numbers have dwindled as many neighbors have left the city. But a small group continues to gather just before curfew. When darkness settles in, they go their separate ways. Mr. Delahanty closes the gate, and the Quarter is quiet again. MICHAEL LUO

 But this time, there appear to be new emotions at play, both on the part of the airlines and the customers they serve. There was also an undercurrent of frustration, rage and even weariness aimed at a process that is becoming almost routine for the airline industry.
Call it airline bankruptcy fatigue. 
 ''I'm fed up with airlines going in and out of bankruptcy,'' said Barry Graham, a software developer based in Silver Spring, Md., who travels frequently. ''On one hand, I've just become so used to it. Bankruptcy is what airlines do. But on the other hand, I'm upset. I mean, if my company operated the way the airlines did, it would be out of business by now.''
 How often do airlines go into receivership? Since the deregulation of the United States airline industry in 1978, almost two-thirds of the major airlines have landed in bankruptcy court at least once, according to Richard Gritta, a professor of finance at the University of Portland in Oregon. Three of them -- Braniff, Eastern and Pan Am -- failed to survive. ''That's pretty amazing,'' Professor Gritta said. ''The only other major industry that has more bankruptcies, on a percentage basis, is the restaurant business.''
 Airlines are tired of bankruptcy, too. ''Actually, what we've grown weary of are the record-high fuel costs that have masked any of the gains we've made in efficiency,'' said Jack Evans, a spokesman for the Air Transport Association, a trade group for the airline industry. Mr. Evans noted that if fuel prices had remained where they were at the beginning of 2004 -- or better yet, in the middle of 2002 -- then, ''it would be a completely different ballgame.''
 Passengers can relate to higher fuel bills, to a point. But they are not an adequate explanation, according to Claes Fornell, a professor of business at the University of Michigan. Professor Fornell is responsible for the quarterly American Customer Satisfaction Index, which gauges consumer sentiment for airlines and other businesses. He said he expected no change in the index, post-bankruptcy, but only because ''the numbers are so low'' that they cannot get any worse.
 Jackie Counts, who manages a travel agency in Springfield, Mo., said her customers were upset at the way the airline industry appeared to have run itself into the ground. And so is she. 
 ''After watching them go into bankruptcy and come out of it again, you still don't see any change in the way they do business,'' Ms. Counts said. She is warning her customers that there could be more Chapter 11 filings, but many travelers are apathetic to the industry's fate, and even, to some extent, their own. 
 ''Travelers have a sense that flying the bankrupt skies isn't going to be a pleasant experience,'' she said. ''But their expectations are so low that they're just happy to arrive safely.''
 Low expectations are a sign of bankruptcy fatigue. After the latest round of filings, customers seem less willing to give the carriers the benefit of the doubt.
 Stephanus Surjaputra, a technical support representative for an automobile software company in Los Angeles, says he believes that it is not just fuel costs, but high labor costs that prodded them into receivership. Mr. Surjaputra wonders why the carriers do not make other cuts. ''Look at the salaries of the airlines' C.E.O.s,'' he said. ''Do they have to be earning so much?''
 Mr. Surjaputra and other air travelers have begun to wonder if deregulating the airline industry was such a good idea. Few are advocating a return to the days when the government set air fares, but Mr. Surjaputra said he believed that some sort of price controls might make sense. 
 But some passengers suggest the resentment that many feel toward the airline business is misguided. Instead, they say travelers should shoulder some of the blame for the industry's malaise. Rick Kline, a project manager for a relocation company in Danbury, Conn., said he thought bargain hunters were partly responsible for the mess.
 Mr. Kline and his wife are flying from New York to San Antonio in December for a volleyball tournament and are paying $220 a ticket, roundtrip. A decade earlier, he had trouble finding a fare on the same route for less than $500. 
 ''It's really the same conundrum as people who buy cheap sneakers but then complain about the sweatshops in which they're made,'' he said. ''When you look at these bankruptcies, there is no doubt. We did this to ourselves.''

HEADLINE: Flights of Imagination 

BYLINE: By TIM GNATEK

DATELINE: IRVINE, Calif. 

 BODY:
Five F-14 fighter planes from the VF-103 Jolly Rogers carve through the sky over Nellis Air Force Base. ''Single left-hand roll,'' calls the flight leader, Frank Ferrante, better known as Trapdoor. On his cue, the planes peel off in unison, barrel-rolling over the desert. 
 Suddenly, a distress call issues from the radio. ''No. 1, I have engine problems,'' reports the pilot, Dave Rose, known as OneEye. His plane drifts, impossibly, horizontally before crashing into flames on the tarmac.
But the day isn't lost; George Schafman, the director of flight operations, saves the pilot with the push of a button. ''Rebooting the system,'' Mr. Schafman says from the control tower, and as if by magic, the planes reappear lined up on the runway, and the flight-simulator squadron can take off again into the digitally rendered skies. 
 The pilots are not actually at Nellis, near Las Vegas, but at the Flightline Flight Simulation Center in Irvine, 45 miles southeast of Los Angeles. It is here, in an industrial park less than a mile from John Wayne Airport, that fans of military aircraft gather to fly simulators designed to give the look and feel of high-performance fighter planes.
 With cockpit controls built from actual F-15 molds, commercial software modified to render the flight characteristics of dozens of warplanes and a control tower that can manage data and communications, public simulators like Flightline are a rarity. Once reserved for those who had taken an armed services oath, such centers bring the sensations of military flight to the public. 
 They provide a particularly exciting experience for those aviation fans who think keyboard-driven flight simulators on a PC are not real enough. 
 A typical first flight session at Flightline costs $40, which includes a preflight briefing, a question-and-answer period and about 35 minutes of simulator time. Repeat visitors can forgo the preliminaries and fly for nearly an hour at the same price.
 For the fans, it is more than gadget lust. ''They're looking for real-world camaraderie,'' explained Mr. Ferrante, a 47-year-old copier repairman from Lakewood, Calif. ''You can get out, shake hands and brag with each other face to face,'' he said. 
 Rich Rebenstorff, the squadron leader for the Hounds of Heaven, which pays tribute to the Air Force 524th Fighter Squadron, said, ''Some guys have a bowling club; we have this.'' 
 Mr. Rebenstorff, like a number of regulars, has military experience. During his 10 years of service, he worked as an avionics technician on Air Force flight simulators before retiring from the military to work as the director of operations for the Montebello, Calif., school district.
 Mr. Rebenstorff's simulation team sometimes dresses in flight suits with patches bearing their call signs, earned for aerial daring or a colorful attribute. 
 But unlike the Jolly Rogers, who are formation fliers, Mr. Rebenstorff's group re-enacts wartime scenarios by editing the simulator software and adding satellite imagery of battle zones. ''We'll tailor our flights to resemble missions being flown,'' he said, ''although we will fun it up quite a bit.'' 
 Although the experience in the simulators may be remarkable, the software behind them is not. The planes at Flightline use a consumer software package, Jane's USAF, a flight simulator. Flightline's license agreement allows it to modify the programming, update the simulator planes' flight characteristics with more realistic handling and build custom fantasy missions for clients. 
 At Flightline, each custom simulator fuselage houses three computers that separately control communications, flight control and graphics rendering. In the tower, nearly a dozen computers are linked to handle the networking and communications among machines.
 Most of the regulars at Flightline are former patrons of Fightertown, in nearby Lake Forest, which gave Southern California flight fans their first taste of realistic fighter simulations in 1992.
 Since then, advances in technology have made simulators powerful yet economical, said Curtis Platt, who opened Flightline five years ago. ''When Fightertown opened, they had to build their own network cards at about $15,000,'' he said. ''Today, I can buy that very same card for $5 at Fry's.'' 
 Although it closed in 1995, Fightertown is partly responsible for the two major simulator centers operating today: Flightline and A.C.E.S., in Bloomington, Minn. 
 Mike Pohl, owner of A.C.E.S., first heard of Fightertown through members of his flight simulator club in the early 90's. ''The entrepreneur in me thought it would be cool to open one up, too,'' he said.
 At A.C.E.S., visitors can choose between flying modern F/A-18 jets or World War II fighters in a cockpit resembling a P-51 Mustang. Both simulator modules look like halved eggs, and project the flight program onto the interior curve of the shell, giving an almost 180-degree field of vision. 
 The location draws many tourists, who pay $45 for a one-hour flight, but has not attracted squadron clubs. To expand business, Mr. Pohl packages corporate training sessions at A.C.E.S., using teamwork as a marketing hook. The package has attracted local companies, including 3M, Land O'Lakes and General Mills.
 ''We set people out in teams and have them decide how to plan out missions,'' Mr. Pohl said. ''It's applicable to the business world: execute a plan and debrief afterwards.''
 As an additional draw, Mr. Pohl worked with a former Blue Angels pilot, Rick Adams, to lead the training. Mr. Adams flew with the Blue Angels in 1968 and 1969 after completing 125 missions in Vietnam and being shot down twice. In the training seminars, he compares his combat experience to the working world. 
 ''I want them to perceive that even the mundane parts, the decisions they make day to day, are just like the fighter pilots,'' he said. ''Knowing the enemy is important. If you're fighting for shelf space, the more you know about the other product, like a fighter pilot, the better.'' 
 After a lecture and lunch, the trainees have a dogfight, and Mr. Adams sometimes joins in. ''It's close enough to the real thing,'' he said. ''Close enough for a fighter pilot.'' 
 Flightline, in California, has also expanded its business by holding birthday parties, bachelor parties and office events for companies like Taco Bell and Motorola. ''We invite corporate groups to come in and let off a little steam,'' Mr. Schafman said. ''We've assigned administrators the pilot role and made the executives the co-pilots,'' he said. ''It's been very effective in getting them to think about how they communicate with each other.'' 
 Access to cheaper components has allowed Mr. Platt -- who sold the business to Mr. Schafman but remains involved -- to continue pushing simulator development.
 His latest project is a 747 flight simulator, which seats five and moves on hydraulic pistons in synchronization with the flight. The simulator runs Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004 on eight computers, one for each of the seven monitors around the cabin and another to control communications and networking with the rest of the center. 
 With the constant evolution of hardware and flight software, Mr. Platt says it is nearly impossible to stay in the forefront of simulator development. ''Everything becomes outdated in a matter of months,'' he said. 
 But the latest processors or programs come with challenges, too, he said. They can overheat or work poorly with existing systems. 
 ''If something works really well, it's often best not to change it,'' he said. ''Reliability is sometimes better than a faster computer.''

HEADLINE: Investigative Adventures in Unemployment

BYLINE: By JANET MASLIN

 BODY:

Bait and Switch
The (Futile) Pursuit of the American Dream
By Barbara Ehrenreich
237 pages. Metropolitan Books/Henry Holt & Company. $24.
 Nobody reads Barbara Ehrenreich without developing a heightened sense of how American business operates. So readers of her new book, ''Bait and Switch,'' will notice how closely its publisher has made it conform to her last one, the best seller ''Nickel and Dimed.'' Their titles have the same ring. Ms. Ehrenreich uses the same basic investigative reporting methods. Perhaps inflation or an extra 16 pages accounts for a $1 rise in price.
 Each of these books has a parenthetical word in its subtitle. ''On (Not) Getting By in America'' was how ''Nickel and Dimed'' described Ms. Ehrenreich's experience of physically draining minimum-wage work. The new book's subtitle -- ''The (Futile) Pursuit of the American Dream'' -- takes her a few rungs up the economic ladder to the world of white-collar unemployment. 
 And each book's cover shows a model recapitulating the author's undercover work. There's a picture of a waitress on ''Nickel and Dimed.'' ''Bait and Switch'' shows what looks like a job interview, with a demure, blond, relatively young woman in an office, staring apprehensively at the man who could hire her. It's an image that suits the book's title even better than might have been intended. The model looks timid. The actual Ms. Ehrenreich is nobody's cream puff.
 But she is once again a smart, mordant observer of the world that her book describes. ''In networking, as in prostitution, there is no time for fascination'' is one of her observations here. ''Nickel and Dimed'' was similarly gimlet-eyed, but its targets were more tangible, given the indignation of a struggling underclass. This time, the very elusiveness of any certainty -- even as to what actually constitutes having a job anymore -- makes it harder for her to take aim.
 Once again Ms. Ehrenreich sets herself specific guidelines for her adventure. She plans to give it 10 months and $5,000 in expenses: skimpy resources, since her book will make it clear that job-hunting can be much more time-consuming and costly than that. She decides to avoid revealing her age (to readers as well as to prospective employers), to claim expertise in public relations and speechwriting (a popular writer is well versed in these things anyway) and to balk at nothing but job opportunities in Baghdad. ''And of course I am admirably flexible,'' she writes, ''applying at one point for a job as P.R. director of the American Diabetes Association and then switching sides and offering myself to Hershey's.'' 
 Ms. Ehrenreich's last book led her into grueling situations; this one gives her galling ones. Soon she has invaded the list-, jargon- and metaphor-loving ''transition industry'' for job seekers, in which well-paid counselors dole out useless advice. One of the first career coaches she encounters thinks that would-be executives should think of themselves as harness racers. ''The horse, driver and carriage,'' she writes, ''symbolize Head, Heart and Gut, but I miss which one is which. This is going to be a lot harder than I anticipated.'' 
 Ms. Ehrenreich does not brook condescension or idiocy well. And she has entered a realm where both are unavoidable. She receives advice derived from ''Wizard of Oz'' dolls (the lion represents an ''instinctual'' personality, the tin man an ''emotional'' one) and surveys a few lists (the ''nine basic desires or passions''), plus assorted slogans, acronyms (''TEAM'' for ''Together Everyone Achieves More'') and baloney-based mathematical formulas. She also pays to have her talents evaluated. She is told she'd make a lousy writer.
 ''I think of my father, whose personality traits included brash, cynical, bombastic, obnoxious, charming, kindly and falling-down drunk, yet who managed to rise from the copper mines of Butte to the corporate stratosphere, ending up as vice president of research for a multinational firm,'' she writes. ''Did he ever take a personality test or submit to executive coaching?'' 
 The world of the white-collar unemployed proves more passive, guilt-ridden and depressing than she expected. It also turns out to be more frustrating: nowadays, an online job application can be acknowledged by an automatic corporate e-mail message and no further reply. 
 At job fairs, would-be applicants are interviewed standing up (to waste less of potential employers' time) and advised to bathe before arriving and hide any tattoos. And landing a job that involves no office, responsibilities or health insurance, or working on commission by promoting peculiar products (''I briefly try to envision a social life in which the subject of cleaning fluids would naturally arise on a regular basis''), means Pyrrhic victory at best. 
 It doesn't much matters that Ms. Ehrenreich never wormed her way into working for, say, the trade association for the modular home construction industry. ''Bait and Switch'' is about a process rather than an end result, and it captures that process all too clearly. As usual, Ms. Ehrenreich makes great, acerbic company for the reader and tells her story knowingly. But this book cannot match ''Nickel and Dimed'' for cathartic indignation. 
 Yes, the people she meets are being suckered by books with titles like ''The Ultimate Secret to Getting Absolutely Everything You Want.'' Yes, that ought to make them angrier. Yes, they are being exploited by hucksters and treated as blame-worthy victims. But this book can only mirror their powerlessness. And its best details provide only fleeting relief from the gloom. When searching for work on the Internet, Ms. Ehrenreich warns, watch out for ''job'' as a keyword for a Google search. Not unless, instead of books promising total success in an instant, you're looking for a more explicit kind of pornography.

HEADLINE: More Deaths Confirmed In Homes For the Aged

BYLINE: By DAVID ROHDE and SHAILA DEWAN; Reporting for this article was contributed by Michael Luo and William Yardley from New Orleans; Timothy Williams from Baton Rouge, La.; and Paul von Zielbauer from New York.

 BODY:
A day after Louisiana officials charged the owners of a nursing home in the deaths of 34 patients there, the owners of two other nursing homes confirmed yesterday that an additional 13 patients died in their homes in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. State officials also said they were investigating the deaths of 14 patients at yet another nursing home in New Orleans.
 The new reports suggest that at least 61 patients died in four New Orleans-area nursing homes after their operators ignored a mandatory evacuation order a day before Hurricane Katrina hit. The owners of 15 other nursing homes contacted by The New York Times said they had successfully evacuated hundreds of patients from their homes.
A total of 53 nursing homes were evacuated in the New Orleans area, but it is unclear how many of them were evacuated before the storm. 
 Some nursing homes spent as much as $50,000 to move their patients to safety, including using private helicopters, owners and administrators said. Other nursing home owners chose to keep their patients in the city and wait out the storm.
 The attorney general, Charles C. Foti Jr., was investigating reports that 14 people died at the Lafon Nursing Facility of Holy Family in New Orleans, said his chief spokeswoman, Kris Wartelle. 
 ''We're trying to make sure the criminal justice system still works in this case,'' Ms. Wartelle said. ''It is such a horrendously horrible thing, and it's so important to these families.''
 Peggy Hoffmann, executive director of the nonprofit Bethany Home, said 9 of her home's 49 patients died after she chose not to move them despite the mayor's mandatory evacuation order. Ms. Hoffman said she had been unable to find 10 patients who were evacuated to the New Orleans airport and flown to an unknown city.
 ''I haven't been able to sleep at night,'' Ms. Hoffmann said. ''We haven't been able to track down 10 of my people who went through my airport.''
 She said she thought it would be better for her fragile patients to remain in the home, which sits on high ground, than to endure the stress of an evacuation. In past hurricane evacuations in New Orleans, nursing home patients have died on buses caught in traffic jams for up to 12 hours.
 Andrew Sandler, the administrator of a second nonprofit nursing home, Maison Hospitaliere, where four patients died, cited the same reason and added that the evacuation order was not made until the day before the hurricane struck.
 ''Usually there is more warning,'' Mr. Sandler said. ''This one came very quickly.'' 
 Neither home flooded, and both had emergency generators that provided limited electricity. Both owners said that day after day of high temperatures inside the homes might have contributed to the deaths, but they were not sure. 
 Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa asked the Department of Justice, the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services and the Government Accountability Office yesterday to begin full investigations of the deaths in nursing homes.
 ''The utter disrespect for the life and dignity of the frail and elderly is nearly incomprehensible,'' wrote Mr. Grassley, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.
 In other developments yesterday, Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco, who has been a vocal critic of the federal response to the hurricane and subsequent flooding, said blame should be shared by all levels of government -- and included herself.
 ''We all know that there were failures at all level of government: state, federal and local,'' Ms. Blanco said in a speech before a joint session of the Louisiana Legislature. ''At the state level, we must take a careful look at what went wrong and make sure it never happens again. The buck stops here. And as your governor, I take full responsibility.'' 
 She said she had demanded that FEMA give priority to Louisiana residents in rebuilding jobs and to ''pay them in a timely fashion.'' 
 The federal government, Ms. Blanco said, should also ''cover 100 percent of what Louisiana will spend on this disaster -- just as was done after 9/11.''
 The governor also said she had issued an executive order directing state agencies to limit spending, and called for federal aid to rebuild houses, bring residents back to the state, offer tax breaks and loans to businesses, and extend unemployment benefits. She said she had hired a former FEMA director, James Lee Witt, to help work with FEMA to cut through bureaucracy.
 Standing outside the chambers, Mayor C. Ray Nagin of New Orleans said he had missed all but the end of the governor's speech but called it ''encouraging.''
 But, Mr. Nagin said, he is ''nervous about how the implementation is going to take place.''
 On Tuesday, the state attorney general's office charged the owners of St. Rita's Nursing Home in Violet, just east of New Orleans, with multiple counts of negligent homicide in the deaths of 34 residents. The attorney general said the couple, Mable B. Mangano, 62, and Salvatore A. Mangano Sr., 65, had not acted on several warnings to move the residents as the hurricane approached.
 In an interview on Wednesday, the couple's lawyer, James A. Cobb, said his clients were innocent, calling the charges ''absurd'' and ''mean spirited.''
 ''These folks have lost everything,'' Mr. Cobb said. ''They've lost their entire life's work.'' 
 He said that the home was above flood stage level and that most of the families decided to keep their relatives at St. Rita's. 
 Tony Mendoza, a nursing home owner who used a private helicopter to evacuate patients before the hurricane's arrival, criticized nursing home owners who chose to remain in the city. Mr. Mendoza said he chose to evacuate his two commercial homes on Friday, two full days before Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans.
 ''It was a given,'' Mr. Mendoza said. ''Every hour that went by since Friday you knew you had to go.''
 Kevan Cullins's 100-year-old grandmother was evacuated from Lafon a few days after the flooding, only to die, dehydrated and weak, a few days later in a hospital. Mr. Cullins said that when his family called Lafon before the storm, staff members said they had a generator and the staff was going to stay with the patients, Mr. Cullins said. If it flooded, he said, they planned to move to the second floor.
 Mr. Cullins said the home had made the wrong decision in failing to evacuate.
 ''But at the same time,'' he said, ''there's a lot of people in that nursing home that may not have made it anyway, they're just that frail. It's a Catch-22. A lot of the people were like my grandmother, 100 years old, and they didn't have too much more to go, but they didn't deserve to die like that.''
 Lafon and Bethany had been cited by inspectors for mistreatment and quality-of-care deficiencies from April 2004 to June 2005. But Lafon, with 8 deficiencies, had less than the state average of 10 per home, while Bethany had 23. For both homes, all of the deficiencies were rated 2 on a scale of 1 to 4, with 1 indicating the lowest level of harm or potential harm to residents.
 Lauren Shaham, a spokeswoman for the American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging, based in Washington, said her group, which represents about 5,300 nonprofit nursing homes, assisted-living facilities and elderly-housing sites, including about 90 in the region affected by Hurricane Katrina, had not had complaints that nursing homes were not evacuated.
 St. Rita's was not a member of the association.
 ''I think the St. Rita's thing, at least from what we're hearing, is really an anomaly, far from the norm,'' Ms. Shaham said.

HEADLINE: Nest Egg Or One-Armed Bandit?

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
TO look at them now, Warren and Kimlyn Preis appear to have hit the real estate jackpot. They paid $425,000 for their current house in Chicago in 1998, and today, Mr. Preis said, it is worth more than double that. 
 The Preises also know what it is like to hit a losing streak: 15 years ago they were stuck paying two mortgages for more than a year after they bought a new apartment but could find no takers for their old one. When the old place finally sold, Mr. Preis said, he barely cleared a profit even though he had owned it for 12 years. Yet he is convinced that ''real estate is the cat's meow,'' and is looking to buy an investment property.
 ''It will always work out because it will go through the bad cycle and return to the good cycle, and when it returns, it usually returns in a grand manner, as you see it now,'' he said. 
 In markets where house prices have climbed the most, the boom of the last decade has created a lot of wealth, and with it a sense of collective amnesia. It afflicts not only those who bought in recent years and have never known anything but price increases, but also those who have been burned before.
 ''Why do people go back to Vegas?'' asked Donna Olshan, a broker in Manhattan. ''They love to gamble. And people love real estate. They think that it isn't going to happen again and they go back in it.'' 
 Even as homeowners in several markets are trying to interpret mixed signals about whether prices and sales are peaking, the willful embrace of real estate persists as buyers overlook steep drops in prices in the early 1990's -- by as much as 22 percent in Los Angeles and nearly 47 percent in Manhattan.
 In some respects, it is not hard to understand why even those who lost money have largely expunged their memories of past stumbles: many have since recovered, and have amply made up for previous losses with recent gains. But back then, the downturn was severe. More than half of the people who bought co-ops and condos in Manhattan in 1986 or later and sold between 1990 and 1995 received less than what they paid for them, said Jonathan Miller, a real estate appraiser. 
 Sellers in some areas of California felt similar pain. In 1994, when Ralph Houghton, a mortgage broker, took a new job near Denver, he and his wife tried to sell the three-bedroom house they had built in Running Springs, Calif., a small community east of Los Angeles near the San Bernadino Mountains, six years earlier. With no offers, they almost fell behind on their mortgage payments. After a year of letting the house stand vacant, Mr. Houghton cut his losses and transferred the house's deed to one of his wife's colleagues, who took over the mortgage payments. 
 Despite his experience in California, Mr. Houghton, who bought a house in a Denver suburb for $180,000, refinanced and added another $60,000 to his loan to cover renovations and the start-up costs of his own mortgage business. ''We're all human,'' he said. ''We need money.'' He said he is not worried because he figures the house is now worth about $350,000. 
 Economists are divided as to whether prices are poised to slide again. Inventories of homes for sale are building in places like San Diego, and last month, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said that ''home price increases will slow and prices could even decrease.'' 
 In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, economists are debating whether the Fed will raise or cut rates to deal with the increased oil prices and other short-term effects of the storm. If rates go down, that could prolong the housing boom, but if not, some economists say, the market is topping out.
 For anxious homeowners wondering just how bad it could get if the bubble bursts this time, the lessons of the not-so-distant past can provide both caution and comfort. 
 Much like in the last five years, homebuyers in the latter half of the 1980's got drunk on real estate. Bidding wars were common, and people rushed to close deals, convinced that prices were inexorably rising. But around 1990, as the defense industry contracted in Southern California and a recession hit the Northeast, real estate prices in those places started to tumble.
 Homeowners who had been counting on appreciation to finance college educations or retirement saw their nest eggs wiped out. Desperate sellers offered to pay real estate agents commissions of 8 or even 10 percent. The proportion of mortgages in foreclosure more than doubled between 1990 and 1992 in California, Massachusetts and New York.
 ''I couldn't sell anything to save my life,'' said Deanna Kory, a broker with the Corcoran Group in Manhattan, who said she went six months in 1990 without selling a single apartment.
 Some sellers simply pulled their homes off the market, but those who needed to divest because of a job relocation, a divorce or a new child often took a hit. In California, 26 percent of all homes sold between 1990 and 1995 went for less than the owners had originally paid, according to John Karevoll, an analyst at DataQuick Information Systems in San Diego.
 In Manhattan, David Dreyfuss got caught in the real estate downdraft when he and his wife, Lauren, tried to sell the one-bedroom prewar co-op that Mr. Dreyfuss had bought on East 57th Street for $210,000 in 1985. Expecting their first child in 1990, the couple put the apartment on the market for $300,000, but were offered nothing close to that price. 
 The apartment sat on the market for more than a year. Mr. Dreyfuss recalled how difficult it was to keep the place in ''showroom condition'' with a small baby. It finally sold, in 1991, for $160,000. ''It was a vivid lesson of the cyclicality of the market,'' Mr. Dreyfuss said.
 The family moved to Rowayton, Conn., where they rented for a year and a half before buying a four-bedroom saltbox house in 1994. The cycle started to move in their favor when, three years later, they sold it for a hefty profit and upgraded to a four-bedroom house in Westport, adding a pool, another bedroom and an in-law suite. Today, Mr. Dreyfuss said, the house is worth 50 percent more than they have invested in it. 
 But his losses in 1991 have given him pause. Recently retired from the marketing company he founded, Mr. Dreyfuss, 51, said he had considered investing in houses for empty nesters. But he has decided against it. ''I think a couple of years from now we'll see that right about now is the top of the market,'' he said.
 Certainly, some homeowners lost money only on paper because they never sold when prices were low. ''Some of the funny money went away for a while,'' said Karl E. Case, an economist at Wellesley College. ''Even people who bought at the peak, by 1995 they were made whole and then some.''
 The housing bust was a godsend for some people, of course. In the late 1980's, Janice Brand was renting an apartment in the Beacon Hill neighborhood of Boston. ''I thought I was completely priced out of the market,'' she said.
 But in 1993, as prices fell, she found a two-bedroom apartment in the Charlestown neighborhood for less than $200,000. Seven years later, by then married, Ms. Brand and her husband, Robert Grady, were able to sell the place for nearly double what she paid and to trade up to a house on two acres on the North Shore of Massachusetts. 
 Low-income buyers were also able to enter the market. Thomas Callahan, executive director of the Massachusetts Affordable Housing Alliance, said that when prices cooled between 1991 and 1996 in the Boston area, many people bought their first houses.
 ''We sometimes call ourselves cheerleaders for the next real estate depression,'' Mr. Callahan said. ''Except we have thousands of successful homeowners who have purchased, so obviously a crash would hurt many of them.''

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 The needs that Nicholas D. Kristof writes about are indeed pressing, and the response of the developed countries is regrettably inadequate to supply the food, water and medical care needed in many parts of the world.
But the problems mentioned are in many ways due to the fact that the countries where the needs are greatest are not capable of supporting the populations that now exist. 
 Any effort to make the changes required to avert the needless deaths that now take place should be supplemented by strong programs to limit the growth in birthrates, or any benefits will be completely wasted.

HEADLINE: Deal for Ukraine Company Renews Charges of Abuse

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

DATELINE: KIEV, Ukraine, Sept. 14 

 BODY:
In the last weeks of Leonid D. Kuchma's scandal-tarred presidency, an American company reached an agreement with his government to take control of a state-owned chemical factory in eastern Ukraine under terms that have been criticized as secretive and suspiciously generous.
 On Sept. 2, dozens of men dressed in camouflage and body armor stormed and seized the headquarters of the factory, the Severodonetsk Azot Association. They were accompanied by officials of a new government, carrying an order signed by a minister under Mr. Kuchma's successor, Viktor A. Yushchenko.
 The order was based on a court case filed by a fictitious company, on behalf of a politician who stood to gain from the seizure, according to a senior government official. 
 ''It was a very serious abuse of the system,'' said the chairwoman of the country's State Property Fund, Valentyna P. Semeniuk.
 The accumulated weight of scandal and internal rifts has destroyed the political coalition that Mr. Yushchenko formed to challenge Mr. Kuchma's government and create a newly democratic, corruption-free government. It has also raised questions about the true success of what came to be known as the Orange Revolution, as members of Mr. Yushchenko's team volley accusations of abuse of power, bribery and other forms of corruption.
 ''Corruption exists in different countries, but in civilized countries there is prompt action against it,'' said Oleksandr O. Zinchenko, Mr. Yushchenko's chief of staff, who resigned, coincidentally, on the same day that the company was seized. Three days later he went public with accusations of corruption among Mr. Yushchenko's senior aides, three of whom he named, and the president did nothing about it.
 Mr. Zinchenko's resignation provoked a political firestorm here that shows little sign of subsiding. 
 Last week Mr. Yushchenko dismissed his prime minister and the rest of her government, as well as the head of the customs service. He also suspended or accepted the resignation of several members of his staff who are at the center of Mr. Zinchenko's accusations.
 Even so he has defended his aides, much as Mr. Kuchma called accusations against his own aides politically motivated. ''There is an anecdote,'' Mr. Yushchenko said Monday. ''It does not really matter whether a man has a daughter or does not have a daughter. It is enough to say in public that his daughter does not behave herself well.''
 That has not stopped him, however, from accusing the departed prime minister, Yulia V. Tymoshenko, of corruption herself. After first striking a conciliatory note after her dismissal, Mr. Yushchenko accused her of siphoning $1.6 billion from the budget ''in favor of private undertakings,'' coercing judges and improperly intervening in a dispute over an alloy plant, Nikopol Ferroalloys.
 ''It is very unpleasant for me to think what Yulia Vladimirovna could have received if Nikopol Ferroalloy would have been transferred into the hands of business groups,'' he said in another interview, on Tuesday, referring to Ms. Tymoshenko.
 Mr. Yushchenko appointed a new prime minister, Yury I. Yekhanurov, and has since rallied political parties, including some that he opposed only a year ago, to form a sort of unity cabinet. He also created a commission to investigate corruption in his inner circle, but gave it only 10 days -- until next week -- to say whether the charges warrant further investigation. He has already suggested publicly that they will not.
 The allegations, however, may prove difficult to sweep aside. Reports of bribery and corruption have swirled around Mr. Yushchenko's circle from the time of his inauguration in January. His son came under scrutiny this summer for receiving gifts and favors.
 ''Corruption is in the air,'' Ms. Tymoshenko, who was one of the most impassioned and popular leaders of last year's protests, said in an interview, citing complaints of businessmen forced to pay bribes to members of Mr. Yushchenko's administration. ''This is the air we had to breathe.''
 A senior Western diplomat said he gave credence to reports that Mr. Yushchenko's aides had solicited payment for access to the president, for appointments to government positions, to influence court cases and to win control over state enterprises. He said a government official had told him of personally being asked for a bribe by one of Mr. Yushchenko's senior aides, whom he would not name.
 ''I think he is vulnerable, because of his loyalty, to the bad behavior of those around him,'' the diplomat said of Mr. Yushchenko, speaking on condition of anonymity because of diplomatic protocol.
 Even an informal adviser to Mr. Yushchenko, Oleksandr Y. Pakhavyov, said corruption was endemic in Ukraine, and the shadowy intersection of business and state made it unrealistic to expect a swift change.
 He cited an effort by Ms. Tymoshenko to crack down on the smuggling of meat through customs. The contraband, he said, accounted for nearly a fifth of all meat purchased in Ukraine. After Ms. Tymoshenko's government tightened controls, prices soared, sparking one of the economic crises that have eroded Mr. Yushchenko's popularity.
 Viktor M. Pinchuk, one of the country's wealthiest men and the son-in-law of Mr. Kuchma, said it was not government policy but commercial interest -- Ms. Tymoshenko's -- that was driving the legal challenge to Nikopol Ferroalloy Plant. He acquired a controlling share in 2003 in a tender since criticized as rigged.
 He said Ms. Tymoshenko had intervened on behalf of a minority shareholder who had close ties to her. Ms. Tymoshenko denied that, saying she was acting to seize the shares owed the state.
 The dispute over Severodonetsk Azot, Ukraine's third largest chemical plant, boiled over even as Mr. Yushchenko's coalition imploded.
 Worldwide Chemical, a subsidiary of New York-based IBE Trade, agreed to invest $180 million in a new company with Mr. Kuchma's government in exchange for 60 percent of its shares.
 James William Grant, Worldwide Chemical's vice president, said that within months the new investors, including Americans and Russians, had increased production, raised salaries and paid off the debts that had forced the former state enterprise into bankruptcy.
 But a lawsuit filed in March in a district court in Kiev -- not in Lugansk, where the factory is located -- challenged that deal, and the court agreed. Neither the state nor the new company had the chance to mount a defense, according to Ms. Semeniuk of the property fund. 
 The government's role in the dispute is far from clear. In letters to American congressmen who voiced concerns, Ms. Semeniuk and Mr. Yushchenko promised that the matter would be resolved in court.
 Yet, despite Mr. Yushchenko's pledges, the minister of industrial policy, Valery N. Shandra, signed an order late last month returning control of the plant to what was left of the state enterprise, and one of his deputies was there when the plant was seized. Mr. Shandra, who was dismissed with the rest of the government, could not be reached for comment but his deputy, Viktor N. Baranchuk, said the ministry had to carry out the court's order, even though it was on appeal. ''We are being made scapegoats,'' he said.
 The men in camouflage -- Mr. Grant said it was never clear who they were or whether they were armed -- occupied the plant's headquarters for four days, as workers and company executives protested outside. On Sept. 6, Mr. Yushchenko intervened, even as he held frantic negotiations to salvage his government, ordering that the factory be returned to Worldwide Chemical until the matter was resolved in court.
 Referringto this case, as well to Nikopol and others, Mr. Yushchenko said intrigues in his circle reflected a ''a very complicated metastasis in the society and in the authorities.''
 Mr. Grant, a former congressman from Florida, said the company remained concerned about the fate of its investment in what had promised to be a new Ukraine.
 ''We expected better,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Gillette Is Betting That Men Want an Even Closer Shave

BYLINE: By Claudia H. Deutsch

 BODY:
LET regulators worry whether Gillette's proposed merger with Procter & Gamble poses antitrust problems. Let investors worry about how that merger will affect the fused companies' stocks. The people at Gillette have a far more immediate challenge: persuading men that they need to buy yet another new shaving system.
 Yesterday, Gillette unveiled Fusion (manual) and Fusion Power (battery operated), a wet-shaving system with a lot more bells and whistles than the company's Mach3Turbo and M3Power, currently the top-selling shavers. It also announced a line of shaving creams and gels to go with the new razors. 
Gillette Fusion is ''the future of shaving,'' James M. Kilts, Gillette's chairman and chief executive, told analysts and reporters who had gathered in a Manhattan auditorium to hear the latest news. Not to be outdone in hyperbole, Peter K. Hoffman, president of Gillette's blades and razors unit, defined fusion for the crowd -- ''a nuclear reaction in which nuclei combine to create power'' -- and intimated that the Fusion system's ''breakthrough technology'' lives up to the analogy.
 Much is at stake. According to Gillette, American men spent about $1.7 billion on blades and razors last year, and another $300 million on shaving creams and gels. Globally, shaving products accounted for more than $10.4 billion in sales. 
 Gillette will spend a lot to get the word out. It would not divulge marketing plans or even let product samples leave the room -- ''We don't want to give anything to the competition,'' Mr. Hoffman said in an interview after the event. But he promised that come early 2006, when the Fusion products hit stores, Gillette will mount a ''blockbuster marketing program, absolutely huge, the biggest launch of a Gillette shaving system in history.'' And, yes, that is true even if adjusted for inflation, Mr. Kilts chimed in.
 ''Mach3 will remain No. 1 for the first few years, but Fusion will become our flagship brand,'' Mr. Kilts said.
 This is the first time Gillette has introduced a full line of razors and accouterments at once, and marketing experts agree with the decision.
 ''Hats off to these guys; they're offering metrosexual nirvana,'' said Gary M. Stibel, principal and founder of the New England Consulting Group, a marketing consulting firm in Westport, Conn. ''You get a five-bladed razor any way you want it, with power, without power. You get the gel and grooming products to go with it. Men will credit the whole system for a better shave.''
 Maybe so -- but do men really need a better shave than Mach3 provides? Mr. Hoffman is certain they do. Noting that 60 percent of the men who tested the Fusion razors preferred them to the Mach3, he predicts that Fusion will be a ''billion-dollar product'' by 2008. 
 But marketing experts, while applauding Gillette's willingness to eat into Mach3 sales, are not so sure. ''It is an incredibly hard decision, to cannibalize your own leading brand, even when you know that someone else will do it to you if you don't,'' said Nicholas Donatiello Jr., president of Odyssey, a San Francisco market research firm. ''But there is still the question of market fatigue -- I mean, at this point, how much better do men really think their shaving experience needs to be?''
 Gillette's agency -- BBDO Worldwide, a unit of the Omnicom Group -- has access to plenty of product images and attributes to whet the jaded shaver's appetite. Both Fusion models have five blades instead of Mach3's three, and they are spaced 30 percent closer than are Mach3 blades -- changes that the company says provide a more comfortable shave.
 The Fusion models have a ''Precision Trimmer'' blade on the back of the blade cartridge, to be used to trim sideburns or shape facial hair. (According to Gillette, about half of all men have a mustache, goatee or other form of decorative facial hair.)
 Fusion Power gets more techie. Its cartridges -- which will also fit on the manual version -- have a super-thin coating that Gillette says provides for an even closer shave. And while it runs on conventional AAA batteries, it incorporates an electronic chip to regulate voltage and otherwise ensure that the ''shaving experience'' is consistent as the battery drains. It even turns itself off if it sits idle for eight minutes. 
 Gillette has already filed 70 patents on the Fusion razors, and it expects to be able to command prices about 30 percent higher than for the Mach3. The manual razor and two cartridges will sell for about $9.99, with a 4-pack of refill cartridges going for about $11.99. Fusion Power, with one cartridge and a battery -- Duracell, of course, since Gillette owns that brand -- will retail for about $11.99, with refill 4-packs going for $13 or $14.
 The elephant in the room, though, is the merger with Procter, which, barring regulatory holdups, should be completed this fall. Procter is already doing pre-emptive divestitures to ward off the antitrust cops -- for example, it is selling its SpinBrush electric toothbrush business to Church & Dwight to avoid becoming too dominant in that area when it joins forces with Gillette's formidable Oral-B line. 
 Fortunately for Mr. Hoffman and his team, Procter is not in the shaving business, so Gillette's new-product plans do not pose any potential conflicts. ''Fusion will be the first blockbuster for the merged P.&G.-Gillette entity,'' predicted William P. Pecoriello, a household products analyst at Morgan Stanley. 
 Mr. Kilts certainly agrees. Fusion is being introduced in North America first, and the merger should be well under way when Gillette rolls out the product internationally.
 Procter has a better global distribution system than does Gillette, and ''our combined sales forces will have the kind of scale to really get meaningful distribution in those markets,'' Mr. Kilts said in an interview. Moreover, he added, ''Procter is one of the best media buyers in the world.''
 The merger could still cause problems, though. ''A big product launch is hard under any circumstances, but particularly so if the staff is distracted by a merger,'' Mr. Donatiello warned. 
 Mr. Kilts shrugs that off. ''You'll see,'' he said. ''We'll write the Harvard case history on how to do an integration while launching a product.''

HEADLINE: Senate Panel Discusses Need for Central Authority in Recovery

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM and CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 14 

 BODY:
Leading senators and former state and local government officials who have supervised the recovery from natural disasters agreed Wednesday that a single government official with emergency powers should be put in charge of reconstruction efforts after Hurricane Katrina. 
 ''We're on a road to failure,'' warned Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, at the first Congressional hearing on the hurricane. He said President Bush should appoint a lead officer, ''the sooner the better.''
As the hearings into the aftermath of the storm opened, Senate Republicans defeated an effort by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, to force a debate on her proposal to create an independent commission to investigate the government's response. She and other Democrats said they would continue to insist on an outside inquiry. 
 ''Only through an independent Katrina commission will we be able to know that no storm or no act of terrorism will ever again leave us so unable to respond,'' Senator Clinton said after the Senate refused on a 54-to-44 party-line vote to consider her idea.
 Senate Republicans say that existing Congressional panels with authority over emergency response agencies are capable of conducting the investigation. 
 ''We should not outsource our oversight responsibilities,'' said Bob Stevenson, a spokesman for Senator Bill Frist, the majority leader.
 The House is expected to vote Thursday on a Republican plan to create a select committee to investigate the storm response, working in concert with the Senate. The 20-member panel would be split 11 to 9 between the parties, with the Republican majority in control. 
 Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, has said she would not appoint Democrats to the committee unless it was evenly divided and both parties had subpoena power. Republican aides said that under the leadership proposal, the House speaker, J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, a Republican, would have authority to appoint Democrats to the committee.
 Leaders of the Senate Finance Committee called Wednesday for quick action on a plan that would allow thousands of evacuees scattered around the nation to get health care through the federal Medicaid program without the usual paperwork. The federal government would also waive the state share of Medicaid in the designated disaster areas and extend unemployment benefits 13 weeks under the proposal. People with private health insurance would receive aid with their premiums.
 ''We need to help these individuals in crisis,'' said Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Finance Committee, who said he hoped the measure could be approved as early as Thursday.
 At the hearing of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Pete Wilson, who was governor of California when the Northridge earthquake struck in 1994, said the recovery went more quickly because he had the authority to suspend rules and otherwise cut through red tape. ''Someone at the federal level should have that authority,'' Mr. Wilson said. 
 Patricia A. Owens, who was mayor of Grand Forks, N.D., when the city was devastated by the Red River flood in 1997, agreed that the priority was to have someone in charge. She also cautioned that the environmental and health hazards of a flooded city had to be resolved before residents could be allowed to return. 
 Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, the top-ranking Democrat on the committee, asked the witnesses how the work of the federal, state and local government could best be coordinated under one roof.
 ''We're all struggling for the right answer,'' Mr. Lieberman said.
 Marc H. Morial, who was mayor of New Orleans from 1994 to 2002 and is now president of the National Urban League, suggested that a special public authority could be established with representatives of all levels of government.
 Mr. Domenici and 11 other Republican senators on Wednesday sent Mr. Bush a letter urging the designation of a chief coordinator of the recovery and rebuilding effort. ''If such an office is not created, we fear that we will have disorder following disaster,'' the letter said.
 Mr. Frist and other members of the Republican leadership sent a separate letter to Mr. Bush, urging him to consider a rebuilding effort on the scale of the Marshall Plan followed in Europe after World War II. 
 Wednesday's Senate hearing looked ahead to the recovery and did not address what went wrong in the immediate government response. But the chairwoman, Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, promised that ''in the months ahead,'' her committee would ''conduct a thorough, deliberate and fair review of the preparations for and response to this devastating hurricane at all levels of government.''
 Ms. Collins said she deplored the ''sluggish initial response that was characterized by a confusing lack of unity of command.'' Even if an outside commission is named to investigate the tragedy, she said, ''it is essential that Congress conduct an aggressive inquiry.''
 Since Friday, Vice Adm. Thad W. Allen of the Coast Guard has been in charge of relief efforts in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. He was appointed by President Bush to succeed the embattled director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Michael D. Brown, who resigned Monday. 
 House Republican leaders on Wednesday endorsed Representative Peter T. King of New York to be chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, a panel that will play a significant role in fixing flaws in the emergency response system. Mr. King would succeed Christopher Cox, who became head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, if his selection is approved by House Republicans as expected on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Father's Ideals Forged Life In East for German Candidate

BYLINE: By JUDY DEMPSEY; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: TEMPLIN, Germany 

 BODY:
Half a century ago, the Rev. Horst Kasner made an extraordinary decision: He packed up his young family and moved from democratically governed Hamburg, West Germany, to this small town in the Brandenburg countryside, then the heart of Communist East Germany.
 ''We were young and idealistic back then,'' Mr. Kasner said recently, perched high above the pews in the choir loft of a Protestant church he rebuilt from the ruins when the Berlin Wall fell in 1989. 
It seemed a laconic explanation of how Angela Merkel, his daughter, who could make history on Sept. 18 by becoming Germany's first chancellor from the East, grew up and lived under Communism until the wall was torn down.
 A slim, tall man looking younger than his 79 years, Mr. Kasner offered insight into the workings of the Communist system in which he struggled to tell the truth and fended off the secret police.
 Mrs. Merkel, who was just 3 months old when the family moved east, has said little about the effect of living under Communism.
 Only in recent interviews has she revealed that her parents instilled in her the need to excel at everything to survive an environment suspicious of her father's Christian teachings.
 Her father, who remains a pastor here in Templin, 50 miles north of Berlin, was certain in 1954, when the Protestant church asked him to move to East Germany from Hamburg. ''We were needed over there,'' he said.
 That was before the wall went up in 1961, and ''you could still travel between both parts of the country,'' he said. 
 The company that Mr. Kasner contacted to move his family was nevertheless astonished.
 The manager ''said there were two kinds of people that went over to the East -- Communists and real idiots.'' Mr. Kasner said.
 Asked what category the manager reserved for him, he said: ''The manager said he would have to find a third category. You see, I was young. It was my mission to go there.'' 
 The initial reaction of the East German authorities, he said, was: ''It is so good of you to have gone over. Many have gone to the West.'' But, Mr. Kasner said the secret services always watched him.
 He said that although he never openly challenged the authorities he used his weekly seminars and his Weissenseer Circle, an elite group of left-wing intellectuals tolerated by the government, to discuss difficult issues. Then in 1968, he was asked to become an informer for the Stasi, the state security secret police. ''I had been discussing Andrei Sakharov's letter at the seminar,'' he said.
 The letter by Mr. Sakharov, a Soviet dissident, was a trenchant account of how nuclear weapons and the arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union could destroy humanity. To avoid this, Mr. Sakharov called for a rapprochement between the capitalist and socialist systems.
 ''I do not know who informed on me,'' Mr. Kasner said. ''Anyway, the Stasi called me in. They told me it was a criminal act to discuss such things.''
 ''They proposed I work for them to avoid pressing charges. I told them anyone could hear Sakharov's letter on the radio. You could not build a wall to keep such things out. I refused to cooperate.''
 Mr. Kasner suffered no penalties. But his wife, Herlind, who had taught Latin and English in Hamburg, and his daughter ran into difficulty.
 ''My wife was not allowed to teach,'' he said. 
 At school in Templin, Mrs. Merkel excelled at languages. She had wanted to train to become a teacher and translator, but was not allowed to because of her father's profession.
 Instead, she studied physics at Leipzig University. Mrs. Merkel's fellow members of the Christian Democratic Party who know her well say her experience as a young woman led her to embrace the market economy and the United States.
 While Mr. Kasner does not like to talk about his daughter, it is clear that he does not support her beliefs. When the wall fell, he would have preferred to have two separate Germanys. ''I wanted a democratic East Germany,'' he said. ''But the people wanted the Deutsche mark. The revolution is now over.''
 Mrs. Merkel, now 51, could hardly wait to seize the moment to embrace unification. ''As far as I have been shaped by politics, I have been shaped by German reunification,'' she said during her television duel with Chancellor Gerhard Schroder. ''I am proud to be a politician for all of Germany with East German roots.''
 In the buttoned-down town of her youth, residents interviewed seemed to take less pride in Mrs. Merkel than in her father.
 ''We are proud of Pastor Kasner because he rebuilt the church,'' said Birgit Dornbusch, 37, an unemployed mother. ''I don't know what Merkel has achieved.''

HEADLINE: At Frankfurt Auto Show, a Reluctant Embrace of Hybrids 

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Sept. 14 

 BODY:
This was the week that Europe's reluctant auto industry bowed to the popularity of hybrid technology, with a skein of announcements by leading German carmakers that they would follow Toyota's lead in developing these dual gasoline-electric engines.
 But backstage at the Frankfurt International Motor Show, a different picture is emerging: Europe's auto executives remain privately skeptical, even dismissive, about the merits of hybrid technology.
A spate of press releases may be no more than that -- a public relations response to what many in the European auto industry say has been the Japanese industry's shrewd promotion of a so-so technology.
 ''This was a marketing battle between Europe and Japan, and diesel engines were Europe's proposal,'' the chairman of Porsche, Wendelin Wiedeking, said in an interview on Tuesday. ''We must accept that we lost.'' 
 Adding to the pressure, some Europeans said, is the sharp rise in oil prices, which has cast a shadow over this gathering and renewed the focus on a search for alternatives to fossil fuels.
 Porsche said early in the week that it would build a hybrid version of its Cayenne sport utility vehicle by the end of 2010. It is joining an alliance with Volkswagen and Audi to develop hybrid engine technology. But Mr. Wiedeking declined to say how much Porsche would invest in the project.
 Volkswagen's chief executive, Bernd Pischetsrieder, played down his company's investment, even though it has announced a hybrid venture with a Chinese partner in addition to the Porsche project. In Europe, at least, Mr. Pischetsrieder said hybrids would not command a premium. ''I can't afford to spend money on something customers won't pay for,'' he said. ''I'm not going to spend any more than I have to.''
 Toyota, which pioneered hybrid cars and is the market leader, hopes to sell one million of them by early in the next decade. Its Lexus division showed off two hybrid models here: the GS450h, which it promotes as the first hybrid luxury sedan, and a sport utility vehicle, the RX 400h.
 But many Europeans see only a niche market. BMW's chairman, Helmut Panke, predicted that hybrid vehicles would eventually account for 2 percent to 3 percent of the industry's sales volume, chiefly in the United States with a smaller presence in Asia and still less in Europe.
 BMW recently joined an alliance with General Motors and DaimlerChrysler to develop hybrid engines. It has not disclosed plans to produce a vehicle, though Mr. Panke said on Wednesday that it would compete effectively.
 ''We'll all have one within five years,'' he said, ''but this is not the big be-all and end-all of technology.''
 BMW is investing heavily in the development of hydrogen-powered cars, which Mr. Panke said he believed was the long-term answer to dependence on oil. He acknowledged that because of distribution and storage problems, hydrogen would not be a marketable fuel for 15 to 20 years. 
 Still, BMW has pledged to make a version of its 7-series sedan that runs on hydrogen and gasoline in the next few years. It displayed a rocketlike, hydrogen-propelled vehicle here that it said achieved a speed of more than 300 kilometers an hour (187 miles an hour).
 Few European auto executives can even discuss hybrid technology without referring to a recent test conducted by a German trade magazine, Auto Bild, in which a Mercedes-Benz S.U.V. with a diesel engine was pitted against the Lexus RX 400h in a drive from New York to San Francisco. The Mercedes finished with substantially better fuel efficiency.
 Advocates for hybrid technology concede that in long-distance driving, the most advanced diesel engines are more efficient than hybrids. But in cities, with frequent stops and starts, switching between gasoline and electric motors gives drivers an edge in fuel economy.
 ''The problem with hybrids is that in economic terms, they don't make a lot of sense,'' said Garel Rhys, director of the Center for Automotive Research at Cardiff University. Because they use both gasoline and electric motors, he said, hybrids are more expensive than regular cars.
 The engines are also heavier -- something that BMW says is difficult to reconcile with its reputation for agile, zippy cars.
 While European carmakers say they are ready to respond to the growing demand for hybrids, especially in the United States, some worry that governments will tilt the playing field by imposing emission standards that favor hybrids over vehicles with clean diesel engines.
 In the United States, diesel technology has never been able to shake an image of being noisy, smelly and dirty. Mr. Panke said the high price of gasoline might prompt Americans to give it a fresh look, particularly since the newest turbocharged diesel engines can be hard to distinguish from gas-powered ones.
 The debate over hybrid technology was so intense here this week that it almost obscured another new challenge from Asia: Chinese carmakers, which appeared for the first time at this show.
 Three companies presented their wares -- Landwind, Geely and Brilliance -- though only Landwind has already sold cars in Europe. Peter Bijvelds, 27, a Dutch car dealer who has the exclusive European distribution license for Landwind, hopes to sell 1,000 of them this year.
 Built in the southeast Chinese city of Nanchang by Jiangling Motors, the Landwind is a boxy sport utility vehicle starting at 15,000 euros ($18,412). Mr. Bijvelds says that is about a third cheaper than its closest rival, and should help Europeans get over their qualms about buying a Chinese car.
 ''They already produce our clothes and our shoes,'' he said. ''Why shouldn't they produce our cars?''

HEADLINE: Bush Thanks World Leaders and Takes Conciliatory Tone 

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and WARREN HOGE; Celia W. Dugger contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 14 

 BODY:
President Bush, facing an array of world leaders who are deeply divided on how to define terrorism or act against nuclear proliferation and poverty, struck a conciliatory tone at the United Nations on Wednesday, describing himself as the grateful leader of a superpower that in recent days has received emergency aid from nations around the world.
 His speech, at the opening of a United Nations session that drew more than 150 presidents, prime ministers and monarchs, came hours after the General Assembly greatly watered down what had once been ambitious plans for institutional change and for commitments to fight terrorism and nuclear arms.
But Mr. Bush only alluded to the leaders' differences, and his tone was far more muted than three years ago, when he urged the United Nations to confront Saddam Hussein. 
 On Wednesday, from the same podium, he balanced his discussion of the need to chase down terrorists with his endorsement of a set of antipoverty objectives called the millennium development goals. Only weeks ago, the administration had proposed eliminating all reference to the specific goals from the United Nations' agenda this week, but the administration subsequently backed off. Rather than declare, as he had in the past, that countries had to choose to be ''with us or against us'' in battling terrorists, Mr. Bush cast himself as the leader of one of many nations fighting the same plague. 
 ''No nation can remain isolated and indifferent to the struggles of others,'' he said in a hall that remained, by tradition, largely silent. ''When a country or a region is filled with despair and resentment and vulnerable to violent and aggressive ideologies, the threat passes easily across oceans and borders and could threaten the security of any peaceful country.''
 Mr. Bush began his speech by thanking 115 countries and a dozen international organizations for offering aid to victims of Hurricane Katrina, putting him in the unaccustomed position of being the recipient of help from abroad -- including from countries like Iraq. ''I offer the thanks of my nation,'' he said.
 Secretary General Kofi Annan seemed to allude to American vulnerability in a speech earlier in the day, noting, ''Whether our challenge is peacemaking, nation-building, democratization or responding to natural or man-made disasters, we have seen that even the strongest among us cannot succeed alone.'' 
 That seemed to set the tone for Mr. Bush, who arrived politically injured. His approval levels among Americans are at record lows, with the aftermath from Hurricane Katrina raising questions about the administration's abilities to respond to a major disaster, and with Iraq facing violence on a scale few predicted three years ago. But even with close to 150 people killed in Iraq just hours before he spoke, Mr. Bush stuck to his message of optimism about democratic revolution in the Middle East. 
 ''It's an exciting opportunity for all of us in this chamber,'' he told the leaders, many of whom opposed his decision three years ago to go to war and have steered clear of Iraq since.
 Nonetheless, American officials traveling with Mr. Bush said that they wondered how successful the White House would be in allocating more reconstruction aid for Iraq now that the hurricane damage will soak up so many American resources. ''It seems clear,'' said one senior official traveling with Mr. Bush, ''that the days of American largess for Iraq are coming to a close.''
 At his toughest on Wednesday, Mr. Bush seemed to scold the United Nations for failing to enact change on the scale discussed for more than a year. ''The United Nations must be strong and efficient, free of corruption, and accountable to the people it serves,'' he said, adding that it ''must stand for integrity, and live by the high standards it sets for others.''
 He described the effort to improve the operations of the organization as in its infancy, adding: ''The process of reform begins with members taking our responsibilities seriously. When this great institution's member states choose notorious abusers of human rights to sit on the U.N. Human Rights Commission, they discredit a noble effort, and undermine the credibility of the whole organization,'' apparently a reference to Sudan, Zimbabwe, Cuba and Libya. 
 ''If member countries want the United Nations to be respected -- respected and effective -- they should begin by making sure it is worthy of respect,'' Mr. Bush concluded.
 He pressed for a Security Council resolution committing countries to prosecute -- and extradite -- anyone seeking fissile materials or the technology for nuclear devices. 
 On Tuesday, Mr. Annan said the exclusion of language in goals on countering nuclear proliferation was a ''disgrace'' that compounded a similar failure at a spring United Nations conference on the future of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. 
 But Mr. Bush did not repeat his previous calls to bar any new country from producing enriched uranium or plutonium -- a plan the administration has done little to promote over the past year and a half. 
 In his references to the goals for poverty reduction, he cited not only the millennium development goals but also another initiative that grew out of a summit meeting in Monterrey, Mexico. There, poor nations agreed to fight corruption and improve governance, and rich nations committed to ''make concrete efforts'' toward giving 0.7 percent of their national income in aid. Mr. Bush did not address the aid issue, but advocates said they hoped his endorsement of Monterrey would make it harder for the United States to continue to oppose such aid targets. 
 Jeffrey D. Sachs, the economist who led the millennium project, said in an interview that Mr. Bush's support ''was as explicit and plain as could be.'' As to Mr. Bush's mention of the millennium goals, he said, ''As far as I know, the president has never uttered that phrase before.''
 The Security Council also passed a resolution calling on countries to ban incitement to terrorism and prevent subversion of educational, cultural and religious institutions by terrorists and their supporters. The measure was offered by Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain in a move paralleling his government's response to bombings in London in July.
 The seats around the horseshoe panel were filled by the leaders attending the United Nations summit meeting, and among those raising hands in approval were Presidents Bush, Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Hu Jintao of China, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil, and Gloria Macapagal Arroyo of the Philippines.
 ''We must unite not just in condemning the acts of terrorism, which we all do, but in fighting the poisonous propaganda that the root cause of this lies with us, not them,'' Mr. Blair said. Citing the bombings Wednesday in Baghdad, he called it ''obscene'' for terrorists to claim to be acting in response to Western aggression against Muslims. ''Their victims are largely Muslim,'' he said. 
 Rights groups in Britain have protested the government's crackdown since the bombings, and the New York-based Human Rights Watch criticized Wednesday's resolution for failing to define incitement.
 ''The resolution's sponsors have made it easy for abusive governments to invoke the resolution to target peaceful political opponents, impose censorship and close mosques, churches and schools,'' said Kenneth Roth, the group's executive director.

HEADLINE: At FEMA, Disasters and Politics Go Hand in Hand

BYLINE: By Alan B. Krueger. 
Alan B. Krueger (www.krueger.princeton.edu) is the Bendheim professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University.

 BODY:
''AS we are all aware,'' James Lee Witt told Congress in April 1996, when he was director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, ''disasters are very political events.'' 
 There is much truth to Mr. Witt's statement. Research on the spending patterns of the emergency management agency shows that, to a significant degree, the agency is influenced by political concerns that are distinct from the suffering and destruction wrought by natural disasters, under both Democratic and Republican administrations. 
Although declaring a disaster should be clear-cut and above politics, the legislation that governs FEMA gives the president much discretion to decide whether an event is a disaster that qualifies for assistance. Upon receiving a request by a state's governor, the president may declare a ''major disaster'' if a natural catastrophe ''causes damage of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant major disaster assistance.'' 
 While no one would doubt that a disaster of the magnitude of Hurricane Katrina deserves the full commitment of the federal government, the language in the FEMA law is vague enough to count two feet of snow in Ohio as a major disaster, as was the case last December. 
 Indeed, the law specifically prohibits the use of an ''arithmetic formula or sliding scale'' to deny assistance. So, disaster requests are not evaluated based on standard quantitative evidence; instead, declarations involve subjective judgment.
 Not surprisingly, in this vacuum presidents have displayed a tendency to declare more disasters in years when they face re-election. Mary W. Downton of the National Center for Atmospheric Research and Roger A. Pielke Jr. of the University of Colorado, Boulder, for example, looked at the flood-related disasters that were declared from 1965 to 1997 in an article published in ''Natural Hazards Review'' in 2001. Even after accounting for the amount of precipitation and flood damage each year, they found that the average number of flood-related disasters declared by the president was 46 percent higher in election years than in other years. 
 The tendency to declare more disasters during election years is not limited to floods. President Bill Clinton set a record by declaring 73 major disasters in 35 states and the District of Columbia in 1996, the year he was up for re-election. 
 When George W. Bush faced re-election in 2004, he declared 61 major disasters in 36 states -- 10 more than in 2003 and tied for the second highest number of major disaster declarations ever, according to data provided by FEMA.
 The increase from 2003 to 2004 was particularly sharp in the 12 battleground states in which the election was decided by 5 percent or less; these states had 17 major disasters declared in 2004 but only 8 in 2003, and, therefore, accounted for 90 percent of the increase. 
 In perhaps the most thorough econometric analysis of the politics of FEMA disaster funds to date, Thomas A. Garrett of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and Russell S. Sobel of West Virginia University concluded in a study published in ''Economic Inquiry'' in 2003 that Congressional as well as presidential politics play a role in allocating payments. Specifically, they examined factors related to the number of disasters declared in each state from 1991 to 1999, and the dollar amount of assistance provided. 
 Of course, a state may be particularly unlucky in any given year and be struck by an unusually large number of destructive storms. To account for this effect, they controlled statistically for the value of private insurance property claims from disasters in a state each year and the amount of Red Cross assistance provided. States that incur greater insurance losses and receive more aid from the Red Cross in a particular year are undoubtedly in greater need of emergency assistance. 
 It is reassuring to note that FEMA payments are substantially greater when the Red Cross provides more aid or private insurance losses are greater, suggesting that more generous FEMA payments do reach states that suffer more severe damage from disasters. 
 Nonetheless, Mr. Garrett and Professor Sobel conclude that Congressional and presidential politics play an important role in allocating FEMA assistance. Most important, they find that the amount of disaster relief provided per incident increases with the number of representatives a state has on one of the FEMA oversight committees in the House of Representatives. Having an additional representative on either of the two main House oversight committees is associated with an extra $36.5 million of assistance from FEMA, they found. 
 This figure may seem to overstate the role of politics because representatives from states prone to be hit by disasters probably seek out seats on FEMA oversight committees. But recall that the analysis simultaneously adjusts for the amount of Red Cross assistance and private insurance losses from disasters each year. So, having Congressional representation on an oversight committee appears to matter even when compared with disasters in other states that cause roughly the same amount of damage and suffering. 
 Interestingly, representation on a Senate oversight committee does not have a detectable effect on FEMA payments, perhaps because disasters are often local events that more intensely affect House members' constituents. 
 All told, Mr. Garrett calculates that a third of FEMA payments are directly attributable to representation on one of the nine FEMA Congressional oversight committees, independent of the disaster's severity. 
 When Congress turns to evaluating the Hurricane Katrina disaster, it should also consider sharpening FEMA's mission. One helpful step would be to define more precisely the requirements necessary for the president to declare a disaster. For example, disaster payments could be restricted to events that cause damage exceeding a specified threshold or significant loss of life. Long before Hurricane Katrina, it should have been apparent that FEMA needed to focus more on alleviating and preventing suffering from major catastrophes and less on delivering pork to voters at election time.

HEADLINE: On Helping the Poor

 BODY:
Let's face it: most Americans wouldn't know a Millennium Development Goal, a Monterrey Consensus or a Doha round if all three jumped out and hit them in the head. But those phrases have life-or-death importance to more than two billion people around the world who survive on barely anything. And yesterday at the United Nations, President Bush used them in front of the world. 
 To understand this good news, here's a quick primer.
The Millennium Development Goals make up an ambitious agenda adopted by the United Nations in 2000. Chief among them is the goal of cutting global poverty in half by 2015. They also call for tackling problems like hunger, disease and women's inequality. The goals include vague wording about how poor nations need to adopt good governance, and how rich nations need to give them money.
 As this week's U.N. summit meeting approached, Mr. Bush's flame-throwing U.N. envoy, John Bolton, struck all mention of the Millennium Development Goals from the text of the agreement the world leaders are supposed to sign. After saner heads prevailed, some of that language was restored, although the agreement remains weak. Yesterday, Mr. Bush said it clearly: ''We are committed to the Millennium Development Goals.'' Full stop. 
 That's important because America, the richest country on earth, is most able to help poor countries reach these goals. 
 That brings us to the Monterrey Consensus, named for the city in Mexico. (Diplomats like to name things after the city where they decided to do something.) In 2002, many members of the group meeting in New York this week trooped down to Monterrey to figure out how they were going to pay for the Millennium Development Goals. The text they signed said, ''We urge developed countries that have not done so to make concrete efforts toward the target of 0.7 percent of gross national product as O.D.A. [official development assistance] to developing countries.'' Since then, Britain, France and Germany have all announced how they plan to do that by 2015. The United States, which was rated the world's second-stingiest rich country (behind Italy) by a U.N. report this month, gives just 0.18 percent of its G.N.P. to poorer countries. And since Monterrey, Bush administration officials have taken pains to tell everyone that the United States didn't commit to the 0.7 percent goal. But it's right there in Paragraph 42 of the Monterrey Consensus. Yesterday, Mr. Bush said, ''I call on all the world's nations to implement the Monterrey Consensus.'' Including, we hope, America.
 We end today's lesson with the Doha round, the trade negotiations begun in (you got it) Doha, Qatar, in 2002. That was just after Sept. 11, 2001, when America and Europe, trying to woo poor countries to join the war against terrorism, finally agreed to start negotiating an end to farm subsidies. Those subsidies hurt farmers in poor countries because they keep the price of products artificially low, giving poor countries little chance on the world market. Since then, no one has cut anything, and the negotiations have degenerated into the usual bickering between Europe and America. Meanwhile, the poor keep starving. 
 Yesterday, Mr. Bush declared: ''The United States is ready to eliminate all tariffs, subsidies and other barriers to free flow of goods and services as other nations do the same. This is key to overcoming poverty in the world's poorest nations.''
 These were exactly the right words, and we applaud them. Now, let's get to it. The world is waiting.

Roberts Jr. on the Supreme Court's treatment of Congress may well have left viewers scratching their heads on Wednesday morning, with cryptic references to the ''congruence and proportionality test'' and to unfamiliar case names like ''Lane and Hibbs.'' 
 But the line of questioning that Mr. Specter, the Pennsylvania Republican who is Judiciary Committee chairman, chose to pursue offered a window on the increasingly troubled relationship between the court and Congress, as well as on one of the most consequential developments of the Rehnquist court's later years.
In a series of decisions, many written by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist himself, the court declared unconstitutional acts of Congress that had been passed by broad bipartisan majorities. 
 Laws permitting public employees to sue state employers for discrimination on the basis of disability and age, and also giving women access to federal court to sue rapists for damages, ran up against the court's new definition of the limits on Congress's power and the justices' insistence that they alone have the final word in interpreting the Constitution.
 ''I take umbrage at what the court has said, and so do my colleagues,'' Senator Specter told Judge Roberts.
 From 1995 to 2003, the Supreme Court overturned all or parts of 33 federal statutes, 10 of them on the ground that Congress had exceeded its authority either to regulate interstate commerce or to enforce the constitutional guarantees of due process and equal protection. Until then, the modern court gave Congress wide berth to define its own role under both of the Constitution's relevant provisions, the Commerce Clause and the 14th Amendment.
 Senator Specter took particular exception to the court's conclusion in several of the cases that Congress had not compiled an adequate record showing the existence of the problems the statutes sought to solve.
 He said that leading up to the passage of the Violence Against Women Act, for example, ''there were reports on gender bias from the task forces in 21 states, and eight separate reports issued by Congress and its committees over a long period.''
 In United States v. Morrison, the court's decision in 2000 that overturned the private-lawsuit portion of the statute, Chief Justice Rehnquist said that ''Congress's findings were weakened by the fact that they rely so heavily on a method of reasoning that we have already rejected,'' namely that various instances of violence against women could be added together to demonstrate an impact on the nation's economy sufficient to bring the subject within Congress's authority over interstate commerce.
 Turning to Judge Roberts, nominated to succeed the late chief justice, Senator Specter said, ''Do we have your commitment that you won't characterize your 'method of reasoning' as superior to ours?'' The nominee demurred and, in fact, was so cautiously nonresponsive as to leave the senator to continue with what amounted to a monologue.
 ''There isn't a method of reasoning which changes when you move across the green from the Senate columns to the Supreme Court columns,'' Mr. Specter said. ''And we do our homework, evidenced by what has gone on in this hearing. And we don't like being treated as schoolchildren, requiring, as Justice Scalia says, a taskmaster.'' Then he demanded, ''Will you do better on this subject, Judge Roberts?''
 ''Well, I don't think the court should be taskmaster of Congress,'' Judge Roberts replied. ''I think the Constitution is the court's taskmaster, and it's Congress's taskmaster as well. And we each have responsibilities under the Constitution.''
 Senator Specter's reference was to a dissenting opinion by Justice Antonin Scalia in a decision last year, Tennessee v. Lane, which permitted states to be sued under the Americans With Disabilities Act for failing to provide accessible courtrooms. On the surface, at least, the decision conflicted with a 2001 ruling, Board of Trustees v. Garrett, which gave states immunity from lawsuits by their employees under the same law.
 Justice Scalia, who had joined the majority in the 2001 case, said the conflicting results showed the ''judicial arbitrariness'' of the court's approach. ''It casts this court in the role of Congress's taskmaster,'' he said.
 Justice Scalia objected to the requirement the court has placed on Congress to show that its legislative approaches are ''congruent'' with, and ''proportionate'' to, the problem it is seeking to address.
 Mr. Specter asked Judge Roberts: ''Isn't this 'congruence and proportionality' test, which comes out of thin air, a classic example of judicial activism? Isn't that the very essence of what is in the eye of the beholder, where the court takes carte blanche to declare acts of Congress unconstitutional?''
 Judge Roberts started to reply that in its two most recent cases in this series, the Lane case from Tennessee and another case, Nevada Department of Human Resources v. Hibbs, the court had shifted gears and rejected constitutional challenges to the laws in question. The Hibbs case, from 2003, allowed suits against states under the Family and Medical Leave Act.
 But no sooner had Judge Roberts started to explain ''Lane and Hibbs,'' than Senator Specter cut him off: ''But Judge Roberts, they uphold it at the pleasure of the court. Congress can't figure that out. There's no way we can tell what's congruent and proportional in the eyes of the court.''
 Mr. Specter asked Judge Roberts if he agreed with Justice Scalia's critique of the ''congruence and proportionality test.'' The nominee declined to say, noting that another such case is on the docket for the coming term.
 That case, United States v. Georgia, scheduled for argument on Nov. 9, raises the question of whether prisoners can sue states under the disabilities act, as Congress intended.
 Senator Specter was not satisfied, but it was clear that he knew the dialogue was over. Before turning to a less freighted subject -- how the nominee would, as chief justice, lead the other justices, all of whom are his elders -- he made one last try.
 ''Judge Roberts, I'm not talking about an issue,'' he said. ''I'm talking about the essence of jurisprudence. I'm talking about the essence of a man-, woman-made test in the Supreme Court which has no grounding in the Constitution, no grounding in the Federalist Papers, no grounding in the history of the country. It comes out of thin air.''

HEADLINE: Support for Bush Continues to Drop as More Question His Leadership Skills, Poll Shows

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM and MARJORIE CONNELLY; Megan Thee and Fred Backus contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 14 

 BODY:
A summer of bad news from Iraq, high gasoline prices, economic unease and now the devastation of Hurricane Katrina has left President Bush with overall approval ratings for his job performance and handling of Iraq, foreign policy and the economy at or near the lowest levels of his presidency, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll.
 For the first time, just half of Americans approve of Mr. Bush's handling of terrorism, which has been his most consistent strength since he scored 90 percent approval ratings in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks. More than 6 in 10 now say that he does not share their priorities for the country, 10 percentage points worse than on the eve of his re-election last fall, while barely half say he has strong qualities of leadership, about the same as said so at the early low-ebb of his presidency in the summer of 2001.
More Americans now distrust the federal government to do the right thing than at any time since the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. And the poll revealed a sharp racial divide. While half of all respondents disapprove of the way Mr. Bush has handled the aftermath of Katrina, nearly three quarters of blacks do. (Mr. Bush won only about 10 percent of the black vote last year.) 
 The hurricane, alone, does not appear to have taken any significant toll on Mr. Bush's overall job approval rating, which remains stuck virtually where it has been since early summer. But the findings do suggest that the slow federal response to the hurricane has increased public doubts about the Bush administration's effectiveness. Fifty-six percent of Americans said they were now less confident about the government's ability to respond to a terrorist attack or natural disaster.
 Taken together, the numbers suggest that a public that has long seen Mr. Bush as a determined leader, whether it agreed with him or not, has growing doubts about his capacity to deal with pressing problems. More than 6 in 10 said they were uneasy about his ability to make the right decisions about the war in Iraq, and half expressed similar unease about his ability to deal with the problems of the storm's victims.
 Mr. Bush's support remained strong among Republicans, conservatives, evangelical Christians and those who said they voted for him last fall. Nearly twice as many people -- 63 percent -- said the country was ''pretty seriously'' on the wrong track as those who said it was headed in the right direction, equal to the worst level of Mr. Bush's presidency during a spate of bad news last year. 
 Over all, 41 percent of respondents approved of Mr. Bush's performance in office, while 53 percent disapproved. Those figures are in line with other national polls conducted in the last week, roughly equal to the worst ratings Mr. Bush has ever received, comparable to Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton's worst ratings, but well above the worst ever posted by the president's father, Jimmy Carter and Richard M. Nixon.
 The Times/CBS News Poll was conducted Friday through Tuesday with 1,167 adults, including 877 whites and 211 blacks. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points for all respondents and whites, and seven percentage points for blacks. The survey was mostly completed before Mr. Bush said on Tuesday that he accepted responsibility for flaws in the federal response to the hurricane.
 Dan Bartlett, Mr. Bush's counselor and chief communications strategist, said the White House was not especially surprised by the poll's findings.
 ''Obviously, as we have said, with a sharp increase in the cost of gasoline and anxiety about the war, that is obviously reflected in the polls, and then we have a sustained amount of heavy coverage of what has been described as a major failure of government at all levels, it shouldn't surprise people that that would be reflected in the poll numbers on the president, and particularly on terrorism,'' Mr. Bartlett said.
 ''The president is going to continue to focus on his responsibilities as not only president but commander in chief, when it comes to making sure we do everything we can to help the people hit by Katrina, as well as continue to conduct the war on terrorism in an aggressive way,'' he added. 
 While the poll found that 70 percent said the Federal Emergency Management Agency was too slow in responding to the aftermath of the hurricane, 53 percent said the agency was now doing all it could reasonably be expected to do.
 The same did not hold true for the Bush administration itself; 68 percent said it had not yet developed a clear plan for finding housing and jobs for people left homeless by the hurricane. Mr. Bush is to address the nation from New Orleans on Thursday night to elaborate on the government's planned response to the disaster.
 Before the storm hit, polls had shown that rising gasoline prices were becoming increasingly worrisome to a majority of Americans, and the hurricane has only worsened that concern. Almost half the public said the economy was deteriorating, the worst that number has been in four years. Fifty-six percent expect the economy to decline as a result of the hurricane, and nearly three-quarters anticipate taxes will rise for the same reason.
 The poll also pointed up starkly different attitudes toward Mr. Bush and the government among blacks and whites that were not so much caused by the storm as laid bare by it. While two-thirds of all Americans said Mr. Bush cares at least somewhat about the people left homeless by the hurricane, fewer than one-third of blacks agreed. Two-thirds of blacks said race was a major factor in the government's slow response to the flooding in New Orleans, while an almost identical number of whites said it was not.
 Storm victims had to wait for a week for help to arrive, said Allison McKinney, 33, a housewife and former teacher in Fort Bragg, N.C. ''I don't think that would happen to any other city, because New Orleans is a poor city.'' Ms. McKinney, who is black, grew up in New Orleans and was among those who agreed to be interviewed after participating in the poll. ''It took Katrina for people to realize that the city had a major impact on the rest of the country. I think it's sad that you would wait for the total devastation of a city to come to that realization.''
 But Juanita Harrington, 78, a retired Verizon employee and Bush supporter in Larkspur, Colo., said critics of the president ''focus everything as if he were a magician and could wave a magic wand and change things.''
 She added: ''The people that were there locally didn't take care of matters there, either. I'm talking about the mayor of New Orleans, I'm talking about the governor, I'm talking about that crazy woman senator from Louisiana -- she was an idiot. He may not have succeeded totally, but nobody else did, either.''
 The poll suggested the cumulative effects of months of bad news from the continuing insurgency in Iraq. Exactly 50 percent of Americans approve of Mr. Bush's handling of terrorism, for example, and while that figure is the single worst ranking since the question was first asked four years ago, it is only slightly worse than it was early this summer. But that is 11 points worse than it was in February, just after the first successful round of elections in Iraq.
 The data also suggest that the residual support that has steadily buoyed Mr. Bush in the four years since the Sept. 11 attacks may have reached its limit, for now. Fifty-three percent of Americans still say he has strong qualities of leadership, down 9 percentage points since he was re-elected andessentially equal to his all-time previous low in the summer of 2001, when his presidency seemed becalmed before the attacks. 
 At the same time, 45 percent of Americans now say Mr. Bush does not have strong leadership qualities, six percentage points more than last fall, and the highest percentage since the Times/CBS poll first asked the question during Mr. Bush's initial campaign in 1999.
 Those general impressions now extend across the board in reviews of Mr. Bush's handling of particular issues. Thirty-eight percent of Americans approve of his handling of foreign policy; 35 percent of his handling of the economy; and 36 percent of his handling of the situation in Iraq. All those are at or roughly equal to his all-time lows -- and below his all-time highs by double digits. 
 Some of the pessimism seemed clearly fueled by higher gasoline prices. Nearly two-thirds of those polled said they had cut back on household spending as a result of higher prices, and 8 in 10 said the administration had no plan for keeping prices down, though more than 6 in 10 said the price of gas is something a president can do a lot about.
 A majority of the public is willing to pay more in taxes to assist hurricane victims with job training and housing; about 4 in 10 said they would be willing to pay as much as $200 a year more to help out with the storm's aftermath. 

How the Poll Was Conducted
 The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Sept. 9 through 13 with 1,167 adults from throughout the United States.
 Black Americans were sampled at a higher rate than normal to permit the analysis of black attitudes in greater depth. From all national polls completed by The Times and CBS News since mid-March, every household in which a black respondent had been interviewed was called again for this poll.
 Of the total in the new poll, 877 said they were white and 211 said they were black. There were too few respondents of other races to show their results separately.
 Both the new sample and the earlier sample of telephone exchanges were randomly selected by computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active residential exchanges across the country. Within each exchange, random digits had been added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers.
 Within each household, both in the original polls and the new poll, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
 The results of the poll have been weighted to account for household size and the number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust the sample for variations relating to geographic region, sex, age, marital status and education. Blacks and nonblacks were then weighted to their proper proportion of the overall population. 
 In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults. 
 For blacks, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus seven percentage points.
 In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variations in the wording and order of questions, for example, may lead to somewhat different results.

HEADLINE: U.S. and European Reluctance to Cut Farm Subsidies Weighs on Trade Talks

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 14 

 BODY:
With three months left before a crucial deadline in global talks to reduce trade barriers, top negotiators for the United States and the European Union were still far apart on Wednesday on reducing the elaborate protections for their own farmers.
 ''We've both got our homework to do,'' Rob Portman, the United States trade representative, said after meetings here with Peter Mandelson, the European Union's trade minister.
American and European officials are trying to breathe new life into the so-called Doha Round of trade talks, which are supposed to lead to an agreement on a basic framework at meetings in December in Hong Kong.
 But the global negotiations, aimed at reducing trade barriers in goods as well as services, have been bogged down in large part because of the reluctance by the United States and the European Union to reduce tariffs on imported crops and subsidies for domestic farmers. 
 That reluctance has spurred a rebellion of sorts by many large developing countries, like Brazil and India, which are demanding more access for their own farm products in exchange for lowering barriers to manufactured goods and services.
 President Bush, addressing the United Nations on Wednesday, urged countries to push ahead and promised to end all American subsidies and tariffs if other nations did so as well.
 ''Today, I broaden the challenge by making this pledge,'' Mr. Bush said. ''The United States is ready to eliminate tariffs, subsidies and other barriers to free flow of goods and services as other nations do the same.''
 But both American and European leaders are reluctant to give up their farm protections.
 European leaders have agreed to eliminate all export subsidies for farm products, but they still have high tariff barriers and pay tens of billions of dollars a year in farm subsidies.
 The United States has lower tariffs on most farm imports, but it retains high barriers for products like sugar and orange juice and it pays out billions of dollars in subsidies to producers of cotton, corn, beef and other commodities.
 On Wednesday, Mr. Portman and Mr. Mandelson put the best spin possible on their meetings but offered no evidence that they had bridged the gap between them.
 Mr. Portman said the talks had been ''very frank and constructive,'' adding that ''we understand our responsibilities as the two great trading partners in the global economy.''
 Both he and Mr. Mandelson expressed support for an approach floated in July by the Group of 20, a collection of large developing nations, which would divide countries into five groups and let the less-developed nations reduce their barriers more slowly.
 Mr. Mandelson said the United States and Europe needed to offer ''joint leadership'' and said ''it is essential that we build a common and coordinated platform.''
 But European officials have made it clear they do not want to reduce their internal subsidies more than the amount prescribed by the European Union's Common Agriculture Policy. 
 That policy calls for reductions of up to 70 percent below the level that Europe is allowed under its current obligations to the World Trade Organization.
 American officials insist that Europe make deeper cuts. But the Bush administration is under heavy pressure from Congress to preserve up to $19 billion a year in farm subsidies. The 2002 farm bill passed by Congress, which Mr. Bush supported, greatly increased support payments for farmers and is set to expire at the end of 2007.
 Administration officials have yet to signal which farm subsidies they would promise to reduce, and farm state legislators are already bracing to defend their local producers.
 Both Mr. Portman and Mr. Mandelson said the benefits of freer trade would far outweigh the losses, and Mr. Portman argued that individual European countries should focus on the broader export opportunities in manufactured goods and lucrative services rather than on their fears about parochial interests.
 But Claude E. Barfield, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research group in Washington, said the chances of a comprehensive trade agreement by December were ''dim.'' 
 ''It just seems that people are so far apart, and that they are apart in so many areas,'' Mr. Barfield said. ''Here we are and it's already mid-September. You have to have the agreements pretty much in place a month before Hong Kong.''
 Pascal Lamy, director general of the World Trade Organization, warned last Friday that time was running out.
 ''The problems are numerous and time is fading,'' Mr. Lamy told reporters in Berne, Switzerland. ''There are a mountain of subjects to address and I hope that it can be climbed.''

HEADLINE: On Eminent Domain, Supreme Court Workload, End of Life and Consistency

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings yesterday for Judge John G. Roberts Jr., President Bush's nominee for chief justice of the United States. He was questioned by, among others, Senators Sam Brownback, Republican of Kansas; Herb Kohl, Democrat of Wisconsin; Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California; Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware; Mike DeWine, Republican of Ohio; Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma; Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York; and Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois. The statements were recorded by CQ Transcriptions. A full transcript is at nytimes.com/supremecourt.

PROPERTY RIGHTS

SENATOR BROWNBACK -- In this Kelo v. the City of New London case, the Supreme Court had decided whether a private economic development plan, which a city government believed would yield greater economic benefits, qualified as a public use. So you had private property taken by the state and given back to private individuals, but it was having a greater economic use -- and whether that was sufficient under the takings clause. In the words of the court, this economic development plan, quote, ''was projected'' -- not resulted, but projected -- ''to create in excess of 1,000 jobs, increase taxes and other revenues.''
On this basis, the court upheld the government confiscation as a public use, and there was an uproar across the country. We thought that private property rights were established and set, and now it appears as if it's not, that the system is different. You can take private property by the government's eminent domain ability and give it back to a private individual.
 Justice O'Connor, in her eloquent dissent, quotes this: ''Nothing is to prevent the state now from replacing any Motel 6 with a Ritz-Carlton, any home with a shopping mall or any farm with a factory.''
 It is remarkable how this issue has stirred, as I mentioned, great criticism. I'm pleased the chairman is going to hold a hearing on it this next week. Judge Roberts, what is your understanding of the state of the takings clause jurisprudence now after Kelo? Isn't it now the case that it's much easier for one man's home to become another man's castle? 

JUDGE ROBERTS -- Well, under the Kelo decision, which, as you explained, was interpreting the public use requirement in the Constitution, the majority -- and, of course, as you mentioned, it was a closely divided case -- the majority explained its reasoning by noting the difficulty in drawing the line.
 Everybody would agree, as you suggest, to build a road or to build a railroad, to situate a military base if that's the only suitable place, that the power of eminent domain is appropriate in those instances. And I think people agree further that when you're talking about a hospital or something like that that satisfies public use. 
 And I think the reason the court gave, really, in the majority opinion, was that it's kind of hard to draw the line. 
 Justice O'Connor's dissent didn't think it was that hard. She focused on the question of whether it was going to be a use open to the public as a road, a hospital; used for the public like in a military base; or private. And she would have drawn the line there and said even public benefits that derive from different private uses don't justify that aspect of it. 
 There was a caveat in the Kelo majority. They said they were only deciding this in the context of an urban redevelopment plan. They reserved the question if it's just taking one parcel and giving it to somebody else, not part of a broader plan. That question was still open. 
 And as you said, there's been a lot of reaction to it. I understand some states have even legislated restricting their power. 

SENATOR BROWNBACK -- And we are considering it here in the Congress.

JUDGE ROBERTS -- And I think that's a very appropriate approach to consider. In other words, the court was not saying: ''You have to have this power. You have to exercise this power.''
 What the court was saying is, ''There is this power,'' and then it's up to the legislature to determine whether it wants that to be available, whether it wants it to be available in limited circumstances or whether it wants to go back to an understanding as reflected in the dissent that this is not an appropriate public use. That leaves the ball in the court of the legislature. 
 And I think it's reflective of what is often the case, and that people sometimes lose sight of, that this body and legislative bodies in the states are protectors of the people's rights, as well. 
 It's not simply a question of legislating to address particular needs. But you obviously have to also be cognizant of the people's rights and you can protect them in situations where the court has determined, as it did 5-4 in Kelo, that they are not going to draw that line. You still have the authority to draw.

SUPREME COURT DOCKET

SENATOR KOHL -- In recent times, the Supreme Court has received appeals in nearly 7,000 cases a year. And as you know, in recent times the Supreme Court has heard only about 80 cases a year. In other words, the justices choose to heard about 1 percent of the appeals that they receive.
 My question for you, Judge Roberts, is, should you be confirmed, how will you decide which cases will make the cut and will be heard by the Supreme Court and what will guide your complete discretion to choose which cases to hear? 

JUDGE ROBERTS -- I appreciate the question, senator. It is an area where I happily concede that the justices are not acting just like umpires in deciding which cases they're going to hear, as opposed to how they're going to decide them.
 My perspective has changed a little bit in this area. Certainly when I was practicing law, a lot of what I spent my time trying to do was get the Supreme Court to take a case. 
 As you know, you file these things called petitions for certiorari, which are really quite extensive arguments about why the court should hear your case, having really not that much to do with the merits, whether it was right or wrong, but just why the court needs to issue an opinion in this area. And I thought they weren't taking enough cases. 
 When I became a court of appeals judge, I thought you didn't need to have more cases taken up for review. 
 But the considerations, some are pretty well established. The job of the Supreme Court is to ensure the uniformity and consistency of federal law, in particular of interpretations of the Constitution. 
 So the clearest case that the court should hear, they should grant certiorari on, as they say, is when two different courts of appeals are interpreting a law differently. 
 Obviously a law should mean the same thing in every part of the country, and if two different courts take a different view of the law, that's the kind of case the court ought to be taking. 
 I think the court should, as a general matter -- and again, other justices have expressed this view as well -- grant review in cases in which a lower court strikes down an act of Congress. I don't think that's an absolute rule, but certainly as a general matter. If an act of Congress is going to be declared unconstitutional, I think the Supreme Court ought to be the one determining that as a final matter and generally not leave it to a court of appeals. 
 So those are two categories, when there's a conflict, when an act is found to be unconstitutional. 
 Beyond that, and this is where I agree with you the umpire analogy does not hold up, there is a lot of discretion in deciding whether it's the right time to grant review in a case. 
 The people who practice before the court talk about the court letting an issue percolate a little bit. In other words, get more than just one or two decisions from the courts of appeals, wait until others have had a change to weigh in. 
 The theory is that makes it more likely the Supreme Court will get it right, if they have the benefit of several decisions from the lower courts, rather than just one. 
 Other cases, justices determine that that's not appropriate. It's not appropriate to wait until the issue develops a little more. They want to look at it expeditiously. And it's hard to lay down categorical rules in that area.
 I have expressed the view, and it may be a view that I'll have to be educated on further if I am confirmed. I'm not stating it as a solid view. I do think there's room for the court to take more cases. 
 They hear about half the number of cases they did 25 years ago. There may be good reasons for that that I'll learn if I am confirmed. But just looking at it from the outside, I think they could contribute more to the clarity and uniformity of the law by taking more cases. 
 I have heard others say they could contribute to the clarity and uniformity of the law by taking fewer cases, but I don't subscribe to that view. I think there's room for additional cases on the docket. 

RIGHT TO DIE

SENATOR FEINSTEIN -- I guess what has begun to concern me a little bit is Judge Roberts, the legal automaton, as opposed to Judge Roberts, the man, because I've heard so many times, ''I can't really say because it may come before me.'' And yet, I don't expect you to say what you would do with Roe one way or another.
 But I do expect to know a little bit more about how you feel and how you think as a man, because you're a very young man to be chief justice. You could be chief justice for 40 years. That's a very long time. 
 And because of the division, and there's also a lot of fear out there, where this new court, now with potentially two new justices, is going to go, whether you've got the ability to bring that court together, to end the 5-4 decisions, to see that big decisions are made so that they represent a much greater consensus. 
 And I'm trying to find out and see are those qualities really there? I was interested in a colloquy you had with Senator Biden on the end of life. And he used the word -- he asked a number of legal questions. And then he says, ''O.K., just talk to me as a father and tell me.'' 
 Now, I have been through two end of life situations, one with my husband and one with my father, both suffering terrible cancers, a lot of pain, enormous debilitation. Let me ask you this question this way. If you were in that situation with someone you deeply love and you saw the suffering, who would you want to listen to, your doctor or the government telling you what to do? To me, it's that stark because I've been through it. 

JUDGE ROBERTS -- Well, senator, in that situation, obviously, you want to talk and take into account the views and heartfelt concerns of the loved one that you're trying to help in that situation, because you know how they are viewing this. You know what they mean when they're saying things like what their wishes are and their concerns are and, of course, consulting with their physician.
 But it seems to me that in that situation, you do want to understand and make sure that you appreciate the views of the loved one. And only you can do it because---- 

SENATOR FEINSTEIN -- That wasn't my question.

JUDGE ROBERTS -- I'm sorry.

SENATOR FEINSTEIN -- I'm trying to see your feelings as a man. I'm not asking you for a legal view.

JUDGE ROBERTS -- I wasn't trying to give a legal view. My point was that, obviously, you look to the views of the person involved. And if it's a loved one, you are the one who is in a position to make sure that you understand their views and can help them communicate those.

SENATOR FEINSTEIN -- How would you feel if you were in that position?

JUDGE ROBERTS -- An end of life situation? You know, I do think it's one of those things that it's hard to conceptualize until you're there. I really would be hesitant to say this is what I would definitely want done or that's what I would definitely want done. You do need to confront that and appreciate all of the different concerns and impulses and considerations.

SENATOR FEINSTEIN -- And every situation is different.

JUDGE ROBERTS -- Yes. And it's one of those things I think is difficult to put yourself in that position and say, ''Well, with any degree of confidence, if I were suffering and confronting the end of life, this is what I would want to do or that is what I would want to do.''

SENATOR BIDEN -- Can any law trump a fundamental right to die? Not to commit suicide, a right to decide: ''I no longer want to be hooked up to this machine, the only thing that's keeping me alive. I no longer want to have this feeding tube in my stomach.'' A decision that I know I personally made, and many people out here have made.
 And the idea that a state legislature could say to my mom -- your father wants the feeding tube removed, he's asked me, the doctors heard it -- and the state legislature's decided that, no, it can't be removed. Are you telling me that's even in play? 

JUDGE ROBERTS -- Well, senator, what I'm telling you is, as you know, there are cases that come up in exactly that context. So that it is in play, and the [inaudible] is that there are cases involving disputes between people asserting their rights to terminate life, to remove feeding tubes either on their own behalf or on behalf of others.
 There is legislation that states have passed in this area that governs that. And there are claims that are raised that the legislation is unconstitutional. 
 Those are issues that come before the court. And as a result, I will confront those issues, in light of the court's precedents, with an open mind. I will not take to the court whatever personal views I have on the issues. And I appreciate the sensitivity involved. They won't be based on my personal views. They will be based on my understanding of the law. 

SENATOR BIDEN -- That's what I want to know about because without any knowledge of your understanding of the law, because you will not share it with us, we are rolling the dice with you, Judge.
 We are going to face decisions, you are, and the American public is going to face decisions about whether or not, as I said, a patent can be issued for the creation of human life. 
 You are going to be faced with decisions about whether or not there is a right to refuse extraordinary medical, heroic medical efforts that you don't want as an individual. And you are fully capable mentally of making that decision. 
 And the idea that without a specific fact pattern before you, as someone keeps -- it keeps getting repeated here -- the law is about life. It's about facts, specific facts. 
 What I'm asking you, there's no fact situation before you about whether or not a person, fully mentally capable of making a decision, chooses to say: ''I no longer want this feeding tube in my stomach. Please remove it,'' and whether or not that is a fundamental constitutional right. 

JUDGE ROBERTS -- Senator, that's asking me for an opinion in the abstract on a question that will come before the court. And when that question does come before the court, the litigants before me are entitled to have a justice deciding their case with an open mind based on the arguments presented, based on the precedents presented.
 I've told you with respect how I would go about deciding that case. It begins with the recognition that the liberty protected by the due process clause does extend to matters of privacy. That it's not limited to restraints on physical freedom, and that that protection extends in a substantive way, and not simply procedurally. 
 I have also explained the sources that judges look to in determining the content of that privacy protected by the liberty clause. They're the ones that have been spelled out in the courts' opinions, the nation's history, traditions and practices. And I've explained how judges apply that history, tradition and practices in light of the limited role of the judge to interpret the law and not make the law, the limited role of the judge in light of the prerogative of the legislature. 

TECHNOLOGY AND THE ECONOMY

SENATOR DeWINE -- Judge, what challenges do you think the courts face in trying to square our old antitrust laws as they are currently written with new business strategies and the high technology markets? And do you think that the laws, these laws, give courts enough guidance to deal with these new economy issues?

JUDGE ROBERTS -- Well, that was really the basic issue that I faced in the Microsoft case before the D.C. Circuit en banc. There was a lot of argument, academic commentary back and forth. The idea this is a whole new area. You can't apply the old principles. They don't work in this context. You need to do something different. A so-called new paradigm and all that.
 And at least the argument that I tried to make on behalf of the states was that the basic principles are the same. The Sherman Act was, as many have said, you know, a charter of economic freedom, and that those basic principles do have to be applied regardless of changes in the economics of the underlying businesses or the structure of the markets. 
 Obviously, it requires a great deal of sensitivity on the part of the judges and it's a real challenge for the lawyers sometimes to be able to understand the economics, to be able to explain them to the judges, and judges appreciate that. But my basic instinct, and it's nothing more than that, is that the principles are there and the issue is simply application in a new context. 

RELIANCE ON FOREIGN LAW

SENATOR COBURN -- My question relates to the Constitution and what is said in Article 3 that judges, both of the Supreme and inferior courts, shall hold their offices during good behavior.
 My question to you is relying on foreign precedent and selecting and choosing a foreign precedent to create a bias outside of the laws of this country, is that good behavior? 

JUDGE ROBERTS -- Well, for the reasons I stated yesterday, I don't think it's a good approach. I wouldn't accuse judges or justices who disagree with that, though, of violating their oath. I'd accuse them of getting it wrong on that point and I'd hope to sit down with them and debate it and reason about it. But I think the justices who reach a contrary result on those questions are operating in good faith and trying, as I do on the court I am on now, to live up to that oath that you read. I wouldn't want to suggest that they're not doing that. Again, I would think they're not getting it right in that particular case and with that particular approach. I would hope to be able to sit down and argue with it as I suspect they would like to sit down and debate with me. But I wouldn't suggest they're not operating in good faith to----

SENATOR COBURN -- Can the American people count on you to not use foreign precedents in your decision making on the Supreme Court?

JUDGE ROBERTS -- You know, I will follow the Supreme Court's precedents, consistent with the principles of stare decisis. And there are cases in this area, of course. That's why we're having the debate. The court has looked at those. I think it's fair to say, in the prior opinions, those are not determinative in the sense that the precedent turned entirely on foreign law. So it's not a question of whether or not you'd be departing from these cases if you decided not to use foreign law.

PRIVACY

SENATOR SCHUMER -- Yesterday, you stated that you, quote, ''agree with the Griswold court's conclusion that marital privacy extends to contraception and availability of that,'' unquote. And you noted that the court's later decisions have based the constitutional right to privacy on the liberty component of the due process clause of the 14th Amendment.
 Now, Justice Thomas, at his confirmation hearing, answered in a way very similar to the way you did. During his confirmation hearing, here's what he said, quote, ''I believe the approach that Justice Harlan took in Griswold in determining the, or assessing, the right to privacy was an appropriate way to go,'' unquote. Now, we all know that Justice Harlan's approach located the right to privacy in the liberty interests of the due process clause of the 14th Amendment. 
 And Justice Thomas also said at his confirmation hearings, along the same lines, that he agreed with the court decision in Eisenstadt v. Baird, where the court held that single people have the same right to privacy as married people on the issue of procreation. However, since he's been confirmed to the court, Justice Thomas has not applied the right to privacy to keep protections. For instance, in Lawrence in 2003, he declared that there is no general right to privacy in the Constitution. 
 Now, yesterday you said that, quote, ''Liberty is not limited to freedom from physical restraint.'' It does cover areas, as you said, such as privacy. It's not only protected in procedural terms, but protected substantively, as well. You said that you agreed that, quote, ''There's a right to privacy to be found in the liberty clause of the 14th Amendment.'' So that seems directly to contradict Justice Thomas' view, once he got on the court, as I outlined, in Lawrence. I assume that you disagree with Justice Thomas's view that there is no general right to privacy, as he stated in Lawrence. 

JUDGE ROBERTS -- Well, I think that question depends, obviously, on the modifier and what you mean by general. I noted in going over the nomination hearings of Justice Breyer he also said that the privacy interest is protected as part of the liberty protected by the due process clause. I think that is the general approach. Now, the----

SENATOR SCHUMER -- Let's talk about Justice Thomas. He said there is no general right of privacy. You seemed to say yesterday -- you didn't seem to say -- you said that there was a right to privacy. Let's forget that Justice Thomas said it. You would disagree that there is no general right to privacy in the Constitution.

JUDGE ROBERTS -- I wouldn't use the phrase ''general,'' because I don't know what that means. I don't know if by saying general they're trying to describe the particular scope to the right to privacy or not. I think there is a right to privacy protected as part of the liberty guarantee in the due process clause.

SENATOR SCHUMER -- A substantive right to privacy?

JUDGE ROBERTS -- It's protected substantively, yes.

SENATOR SCHUMER -- Your reading of Justice Thomas's case in Lawrence, that he does not believe in that?

JUDGE ROBERTS -- No. I think his statement obviously focused on general. And his conclusion in that case was that the right to privacy protected under the due process clause that you noted he acknowledged at his hearings did not extend to include the activity at issue in Lawrence.

SENATOR SCHUMER -- This is obviously very important, because Justice Thomas seemed to be more full in his view of privacy at his confirmation hearing than later, when he was on the court, at least if you read his decisions. And you are not willing to say that your view is different than the view Justice Thomas stated in Lawrence.

JUDGE ROBERTS -- I'm not willing to state a particular view on the Lawrence decision. And that's consistent with the approach that I've taken----

SENATOR SCHUMER -- Let me ask you a broader question. Do you disagree with Justice Thomas's interpretation of the right to privacy in any decided case?

JUDGE ROBERTS -- Senator, I'm not going to comment on whether I think particular cases were correctly decided or not, in areas----

SENATOR SCHUMER -- I didn't ask that.

JUDGE ROBERTS -- Well, I don't know which cases you're talking about.

SENATOR SCHUMER -- Any, any one you want.

JUDGE ROBERTS -- Well, that would be commenting on whether that decision was correctly decided or not. If I'm agreeing or disagreeing with one of the justice's views in that case, that would be commenting on whether that view was correct or not. If it was in a dissent, it would be disagreeing.
 If it was in the majority, it would be agreeing. And because those are in areas that could come before the court, like every other nominee to come before this committee who's on the court today, I think it's inappropriate to comment on the correctness or incorrectness of those decisions in areas that could come before the court. 

LEGAL EXPERIENCE

SENATOR DURBIN -- Aside from a few pro bono cases, as important as they are -- and I salute you for being involved in them -- what would the powerless, the disenfranchised, minorities and others see in your life experience that would lead them to believe that they would have a fighting chance in your court?

JUDGE ROBERTS -- Well, senator, I think there are many things that people could look to. You said I had a comfortable life. I think that's a fair characterization. I had a middle-class upbringing in Indiana. As part of that, I worked in the steel mills outside of Gary during the summers as soon as I was old enough to do that, and throughout my life have been exposed to and mixed with at school, learned and played with people of a wide variety of backgrounds.
 Comfortable, yes. But isolated in no sense. I was, I would say, a typical middle-class kid growing up in Indiana and had, I think, a great upbringing. I was privileged in the sense of having my parents and sisters contributing to my upbringing and education. And I think people looking at my life would see someone in that experience and, obviously, with limitations. I wasn't raised in other places in the country and might have a different perspective if I were. I wasn't raised in different circumstances and would have different experiences if I were. 
 As you look at the Supreme Court, the people on there come from widely different backgrounds and experiences, and I think that's a healthy thing. But as far as someone going into court, and looking to see why they would expect to get a fair hearing from me, I think -- and I could answer this with respect to the court I'm on now. 

SENATOR DURBIN -- Yes, please.

JUDGE ROBERTS -- It's hard for me to imagine what their case is about, that I haven't been on their side at some point in my career. If it's somebody who's representing welfare recipients who have had their benefits cut off, I've done that. If it's somebody who is representing a criminal defendant who's facing a long sentence in prison, I've done that. If it's a prosecutor who's doing his job to defend society's interest against criminals, I've been on the side of the prosecution. If it's somebody who's representing environmental interests, environmentalists in the Supreme Court, I've done that. If it's somebody who is representing the plaintiffs in an antitrust case, I've been in that person's shoes. I've done that. If it's somebody representing a defendant in any trust case, I've done that as well.
 It's one of the, I think, great benefits of the opportunity I've had to practice law as I have is that it has not been a specialized practice. I've not just represented one side or the other. I've represented all of those interests. And I think those people will know that I have had their perspective. I've been on the other side of the podium with a case just like theirs. And that should, I hope, and I hope it does now, encourage them that I will be fair and that I will decide the case according to law, but I will have seen it from their perspective.

HEADLINE: Numbers Show Economic Lag Before Storm

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 14 

 BODY:
Hurricane Katrina is eating into the economy, leading to concern that consumers will lose confidence and curtail spending.
 The government reported Wednesday that retail sales fell 2.1 percent in August, even before the storm hit, as high gasoline prices jolted consumers.
 Also, industrial output was nearly flat, reflecting widespread shutdowns of oil platforms, refineries and chemical plants along the battered Gulf Coast. 
 Analysts said they still believed that Katrina would amount to only a temporary blow to the economy and that strong growth would follow as rebuilding begins. 
 The decline in retail sales was twice the size economists had forecast.
 The weakness came from a 12 percent drop in auto sales. Demand slackened after two strong months when American automakers allowed consumers to buy at the discount prices given to the automakers' employees. 
 Excluding autos, retail sales rose by 1 percent, with half of that coming from a huge rise in gasoline prices. Analysts said the retail sales data was evidence that gasoline above $3 a gallon was having an impact on consumer demand in other areas like clothing.
 Sales at department stores rose a sluggish 0.3 percent. Demand at clothing stores was flat in August after a 0.9 percent decline in July.
 The biggest increase in spending in August occurred at service stations. The 4.4 percent increase reflected pump prices that have soared past $3 a gallon in many places.
 Without the jump in spending at gas stations, retail sales would have fallen by 2.8 percent last month as demand faltered in many sectors, the government estimated.
 Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, a consulting firm in Valhalla, N.Y., said he did not expect a quick rebound in retail sales. Mr. Shepherdson said he believed high energy costs would continue to depress consumer spending for several more months.
 Industrial output posted a 0.1 percent gain in August. It would have been 0.4 percent, the Federal Reserve reported, if not for the shutdown of much energy and chemical production along the Gulf Coast at the end of August.
 Economists predicted the hurricane fallout would continue as the energy industry struggles to regain its footing.
 ''The industrial production numbers in the next two months will look pretty awful as the full impact of the hurricane-related shutdowns shows up in the data,'' said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at Global Insight, a Lexington, Mass., consulting firm.

O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'LENNON' In the immortal words of Yoko Ono, ''Aieeeee!'' (2:10). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

*'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)

Off Broadway

*'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'THE BLOWIN OF BAILE GALL' Ronan Noone's play concerns the complicated relationships among four laborers and a general contractor renovating a house in Ireland. Mr. Noone draws his characters sharply and surely, but the play is overburdened with conflict. There's enough here to fuel a whole season of a television soap (2:00). Irish Arts Center, 553 West 51st Street, Clinton, (212)868-4444. (Isherwood)

'DEDICATION, OR THE STUFF OF DREAMS' Portraying a terminally ill, rancidly rich misanthrope in Terrence McNally's play about a small-town children's theater troupe, Marian Seldes is a snappy advertisement for the time-defying benefits of a religious devotion to theater. She is, in fact, what ''Dedication'' is all about, or intends to be, anyway. Burdened with soap-opera-ish plot turns and artificially bright dialogue, this comedy of mortality never seems able to convince itself that life and art trump death and doubt. (2:15). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200. (Brantley)

'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast. So, while literally and figuratively giving off many good vibes, it adds up to lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Lawrence Van Gelder)

* 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'JOY' John Fisher's play with music, a lecture-prone valentine to San Francisco and gay life among college students, says less about human sexuality and longing than the classic, melancholy love songs the cast performs (2:00). The Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Andrea Stevens)

*'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros,'' which was directed by Orson Welles and starred Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'ONCE AROUND THE SUN' The ''sun'' of the title could be the talent and energy of its impressive cast: you can warm your hands on them and on the catchy music. Unfortunately, the book fails to capitalize on these strengths, instead presenting a trite fable about a young rock singer seduced by celebrity, with cardboard characters, despite the actors' best efforts to give them dimension. Still, the performances are very entertaining (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Anne Midgette)

'ONE-MAN STAR WARS TRILOGY' With a storm trooper roaming the aisles and a woman in an Obi-Wan Kenobi get-up telling theatergoers to turn off their cellphones or they will be turned into ''cosmic dust,'' Charles Ross's sprint through Episodes IV through VI aims for the atmosphere of a ''Star Wars'' convention but ends up achieving something like a religious revival (which is sort of the same thing). True believers will love how Mr. Ross, a self-confessed geek who plays every major role in under an hour, simulates R2D2, but everyone else will scratch his head (1:00). Lamb's Theater, 130 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Jason Zinoman)

'PHILADELPHIA, HERE I COME!' Ciaran O'Reilly's small but spirited production of Brian Friel's mournful, funny 1964 play centers on a lonely young man preparing to flee the small-minded Irish backwater he grew up in for the big time in the U.S. of A. Michael FitzGerald and James Kennedy are nicely contrasted as the public and private faces of a man at a painful crossroads (2:20). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)727-2737. (Isherwood)

*'SIDES: THE FEAR IS REAL' This hilarious collection of sketches may send up familiar targets -- the insecure thespian, the fraudulent acting teacher, the arrogant Juilliard grad -- but since it's performed with such specificity and comic charm by actors firing on all cylinders, you won't care a whit. Written by and starring an all-Asian-American cast, this slight but consistently entertaining satire is a primer on what not to do in an audition room (1:15). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)307-4100. (Zinoman)

*'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

Off Off Broadway

'THE AUDITION' Nine actors perform monologues for judges and the audience, which votes to winnow them down to six actors. This tame specimen of ''reality theater'' is more like auditing an average acting class than like watching a staged variation on ''American Idol'' (1:45). Wings Theater, 154 Christopher Street, West Village, (212)696-7303.(Rob Kendt)

'THE BREADWINNER' My, there's a lot of dialogue in ''The Breadwinner,'' W. Somerset Maugham's comedy about a stockbroker named Charles (Jack Gilpin) who toils for the benefit of his ungrateful family, but it's worth choking down the wordiness for a dandy scene midway through in which he turns the tables on the smug leeches (2:00). Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger)

'HOLY CROSS !' Rob Nash's infectious solo show, based on his years at a Jesuit high school in Texas, mines the 1980's for pop-culture references and for John Hughes-style narrative devices. But the nostalgia goes deeper than Izod and ''Purple Rain'' in this unexpectedly rich coming-of-age tale, made all the warmer by Mr. Nash's cool, unflappable demeanor (1:30). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212)868-4444. (Kendt)

'SCREEN PLAY' A.R. Gurney's gleefully partisan retooling of the film ''Casablanca'' sets one tough saloon owner's battle between idealism and cynicism in Buffalo in the 21st century. Staged by Jim Simpson as a deftly orchestrated reading, ''Screen Play'' turns out to be more than a quick collegiate caper; it's a morally indignant work that fights frivolity with frivolity (1:10). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212)352-3101. (Brantley)

Long-Running Shows

'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'BLUE MAN GROUP' Conceptual art as entertainment (1:45). Astor Place Theater, 434 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)254-4370. (Brantley)

'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212)239-6200.(Brantley)

'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)

'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)

'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)

*'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212)307-4100.(Van Gelder)

'STOMP' And the beat goes on (and on), with percussion unlimited (1:30). Orpheum Theater, Second Avenue at Eighth Street, East Village, (212)477-2477. (Brantley)

'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)

Last Chance

*'THE PILLOWMAN' For all its darkness of plot and imagery, Martin McDonagh's tale of a suspected child murderer in a totalitarian state dazzles with a brightness now largely absent from Broadway. Exquisitely directed and designed, ''The Pillowman'' features top-of-the-line performances from Billy Crudup, Jeff Goldblum, Zeljko Ivanek and Michael Stuhlbarg (2:40). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200, closing Sunday. (Brantley)

Movies

Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.

*'THE ARISTOCRATS' (No rating, 89 minutes) A rigorously scholarly documentary about the theory and practice of joke-telling that also happens to be one of the filthiest, vilest, most extravagantly obscene movies ever made -- and one of the funniest. (A.O. Scott)

'ASYLUM' (R, 90 minutes) A dreary, claustrophobic soap, with Natasha Richardson, about a 1950's bored wife and mother victimized by her times and her incredibly bad taste in men; based on Patrick McGrath's novel and directed by David Mackenzie. (Manohla Dargis)

*'BAD NEWS BEARS' (PG-13, 111 minutes) Filled with small, cute kids and large, goofy laughs, and kept aloft by Billy Bob Thornton's ribald star turn, Richard Linklater's remake of this 1976 sports comedy won't rock your movie world. But the fact that the filmmaker keeps the freak flag flying in the face of our culture of triumphalism is a thing of beauty. (Dargis)

*'BATMAN BEGINS' (PG-13, 137 minutes) Conceived in the shadow of American pop rather than in its bright light, this tense, effective iteration of Bob Kane's original comic book owes its power and pleasures to a director (Christopher Nolan) who takes his material seriously and to a star (a terrific Christian Bale) who shoulders that seriousness with ease. ''Batman Begins'' is the seventh live-action film to take on the comic-book legend and the first to usher it into the kingdom of movie myth. (Dargis)

'THE BAXTER' (PG-13, 91 minutes) A ''Baxter,'' in the lingo of this romantic comedy written by, directed by and starring the comedian Michael Showalter, is the safe choice, the also-ran, the guy who is left at the altar when the hero shows up, as Dustin Hoffman did in ''The Graduate,'' to claim his true love. The film's tragic flaw is that Mr. Showalter is miscast -- or has miscast himself -- in the title role. In the end, ''The Baxter'' is a Baxter of a movie: well meaning and mildly likable, but unlikely to sweep you off your feet. (Dana Stevens)

* 'BROKEN FLOWERS' (R, 105 minutes) Sweet, funny, sad and meandering, Jim Jarmusch's new film sends Bill Murray's aging Don Juan out in search of a son he never knew he had. He finds four former lovers, including Sharon Stone and Jessica Lange, and reveals once again that he is the quietest and finest comic actor working in movies today. (Scott)

'THE BROTHERS GRIMM' (PG-13, 118 minutes) Despite a few early sparks of promise, Terry Gilliam's big-screen adventure about the brother folklorists (played by Matt Damon and Heath Ledger) sputters and coughs along like an unoiled machine, grinding gears and nerves in equal measure. (Dargis)

'THE CAVE' (PG-13, 97 minutes) In Bruce Hunt's formulaic ''Cave,'' a group of ace cave-divers are flown in to investigate an intricate maze system discovered beneath the ruins of an ancient Romanian abbey, but instead become the prey of mutated demonlike creatures that can fly and see in the dark. Dreadfully dull, muddled and chaotic, with colorless and underdeveloped characters.(Laura Kern)

'CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY' (PG, 116 minutes) Flawed but fascinating. Some of the departures from the book will make Roald Dahl fans roll their eyes, but some of the visuals will make their eyes (and everyone else's) pop. (Scott)
*'THE CONSTANT GARDENER' (R, 129 minutes) A superior thriller with a conscience, from John le Carre's novel.( Scott)

'COTE D'AZUR (CRUSTACES & COQUILLAGES)' (No rating, 90 minutes, in French) This pansexual French sex farce embellished with songs is neither funny nor sexy nor enlightening in the manner of the traditional Gallic sex comedy. (Stephen Holden)

*'EL CRIMEN PERFECTO' (No rating, 105 minutes, in Spanish) In this antic and outrageous black comedy, Rafael Gonzalez (Guillermo Toledo) is a salesman in the women's section of a Madrid department store. Rafael's fondest dream is to be floor manager; when his archrival for the position, Don Antonio (Luis Varela), is accidentally killed in a scuffle in the dressing room, Rafael's world begins to unravel. Like the Ferris wheel that serves as the setting for one of its climactic scenes, ''El Crimen Perfecto'' is a bright, gaudy and tremendously satisfying ride. (Stevens)

'THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE' (PG-13, 114 minutes) If you must see only one demonic-possession courtroom drama this year, wait for the next one. (Scott)

*'THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN' (R, 111 minutes) A sex comedy turned romantic bliss-out, with Steve Carell, in which the sound of one prophylactic snapping is just a single sweet note in the glorious symphony of love. (Dargis)

'FOUR BROTHERS' (R, 148 minutes) In John Singleton's slick hybrid of urban western and modern blaxploitation movie, four young men, two black and two white, reunite in Detroit to avenge the shooting death of their saintly adoptive mother. Preposterous, amoral and exciting. (Holden)

'GREEN STREET HOOLIGANS' (R, 109 minutes) A feature-length folly about the terrors and self-affirming joys of football (that is, soccer) hooliganism. (Dargis)

*'GRIZZLY MAN' (R, 103 minutes) Werner Herzog's bold, enthralling documentary about one man's journey into the heart of darkness (and the belly of the beast) traces the life and strange times of the self-anointed grizzly expert Timothy Treadwell. (Dargis)

'HARD GOODBYES: MY FATHER' (No rating, 113 minutes, in Greek) Penny Panayotopoulou's emotionally charged drama, set in Athens in 1969, focuses on a mother and her two sons learning to cope with the sudden death of their husband/father, a traveling salesman who wasn't even a solid presence in the first place. The exceptionally bright and somewhat peculiar 10-year-old Elias, living in a fantasy world, adamantly refuses to believe that his father won't return. (Kern)

'HELLBENT' (No rating, 85 minutes) Out for a night of Halloween fun, four hunky friends are stalked by a totally buff masked killer, a cross between Batman and the Grim Reaper, who with a menacing, scythelike knife, slices his victims' heads cleanly off and keeps them as souvenirs. A compulsively watchable chiller that may just be the first entry in the gay slasher genre. (Kern)

'HUSTLE & FLOW' (R, 114 minutes) Terrence Howard is superb as a Memphis pimp chasing his dream of hip-hop stardom in a movie that is an awkward mix of realism, misogyny and Hollywood hokum. (Scott)

* 'JUNEBUG' (R, 107 minutes) A Southern ''Five Easy Pieces,'' this deep, bittersweet comedy about a young man's return from Chicago to his family's North Carolina home envelops us in the texture of a culture the movies seldom visit. Amy Adams gives an incandescent portrayal of the man's pregnant, childlike sister-in-law. (Holden)

*'KAMIKAZE GIRLS' (No rating, 102 minutes, in Japanese) The girls of the film's title mostly just want to have fun (as does the director, Tetsuya Nakashima), which doesn't mean that their pretty little heads are empty. It's just that thinking seems more agreeable when you're wearing a frilly bonnet and peek-a-boo knee socks that make grown men cry. (Dargis)

*'KEANE' (R, 93 minutes) A man goes searching for his lost daughter -- or does he? The irony of this very fine film is that while the director Lodge Kerrigan's approach can verge on the entomological, he grants this troubled, difficult character the full measure of his humanity. (Dargis)

'MAD HOT BALLROOM' (PG, 105 minutes) This documentary follows fifth graders from three very different New York City public schools as they prepare to compete in a ballroom dancing tournament. The sight of 10-year-olds trying to master the graceful, grown-up motions of the fox trot and the tango is charming, and the glimpses of their lives in and outside of school are fascinating, though unfortunately the film offers little more than glimpses. (Scott)

'THE MAN' (PG-13, 83 minutes) Angry black man and nerdy white guy ride around the streets of Detroit looking for criminals. Nothing to see here. (Scott)

*'MARCH OF THE PENGUINS' (G, 80 minutes) This sentimental but riveting documentary follows the one-year mating cycle of emperor penguins in Antarctica when they leave the ocean and march inland to breed and lay eggs. Narrated by Morgan Freeman, the film has no qualms about playing on our emotions. (Holden)

*'THE MEMORY OF A KILLER' (R, 120 minutes, in Flemish and French) Directed by Erik Van Looy, this nicely kinked Belgian thriller features a range of good guys and bad, including one whose sense of morality and world-weariness seem straight out of a Jean-Pierre Melville film. (Dargis)

*'MURDERBALL' (R, 86 minutes) The brutal, highly competitive sport of wheelchair rugby is the subject of this exciting and uplifting (but never mawkish) documentary about the redemptive power of fierce athletic competition. (Holden)

*'MUSIC FROM THE INSIDE OUT' (No rating, 90 minutes) Daniel Anker's profound and genuinely moving documentary ''Music From the Inside Out'' skillfully assembles insightful interviews with members of the prestigious Philadelphia Orchestra with snippets of an eclectic variety of music genres, including classical, bluegrass, jazz and world beats, capturing the power of the creative process in an uncommonly perceptive and inspiring way. (Kern)

'PIGGIE' (No rating, 90 minutes) Monotonous female coming-of-age story about a simple-minded teenager in upstate New York who becomes infatuated with a Ratso-like drifter. Aiming for documentary-style realism, the filmmakers achieve only badly lighted, awkwardly acted scenes that wobble as if captured from atop a mound of Jell-O.(Jeannette Catsoulis)

*'PRETTY PERSUASION' (No rating, 104 minutes) In this go-for-broke satire, Evan Rachel Wood plays a toxic 15-year-old alpha girl who joins with two sidekicks from her private Beverly Hills high school to falsely accuse their English and drama teacher of sexual harassment. Very funny and very nasty. (Holden)

* 'RED EYE' (PG-13, 85 minutes) The sights and sounds of two people talking become a nerve-jangling duet for cat and mouse, hunter and prey in Wes Craven's nifty, tense thriller. (Dargis)

* 'SKY HIGH' (PG, 102 minutes) This witty Disney adventure comedy imagines a high school for superheroes, hidden above the clouds, where the students are divided into Heroes and Sidekicks. The movie poses the age-old question ''Is there life after high school?'' and with a cheerful wink answers, ''No, not really.'' (Holden)

*'TONY TAKITANI' (No rating, 75 minutes, in Japanese) In this delicate wisp of a film with a surprisingly sharp sting, a lonely man awakens to life for the first time at 37 during a brief idyll. Directed by Jun Ichikawa, from a short story by Haruki Murakami. (Dargis)

* 'TOUCH THE SOUND' (No rating, 99 minutes) As Thomas Riedelsheimer's enlightening, mystical documentary follows the deaf Scottish percussionist Evelyn Glennie around the globe, it illustrates her understanding that sound is a physical sensation experienced throughout the body, as well as an auditory one. (Holden)

'TRANSPORTER 2' (PG-13, 88 minutes) Ex-Special Forces operative Frank Martin (Jason Statham), the blank-faced professional driver with more tricks -- and lives -- than James Bond, is back in this purely shallow, but never dull, sequel to ''The Transporter.'' This time, he's in Miami and will do whatever it takes to save the life of a young boy who's been kidnapped and injected with a deadly contagious virus. (Kern)

* '2046' (R, 129 minutes) An ecstatically beautiful story in which time is marked not by the hands of a clock, but by the women who pass through one man's life, ''2046'' is the eighth feature film from the Hong Kong director Wong Kar-wai and the long-awaited follow-up to his art-house favorite ''In the Mood for Love.'' A film about longing, loss and the delicate curve of a woman's back, it is also an unqualified triumph. (Dargis)

'AN UNFINISHED LIFE' (PG-13, 108 minutes) This contemporary Western starring Robert Redford, Jennifer Lopez and Morgan Freeman is a solemn, sentimental bore that suffocates in its own predictability and watered-down psychobabble. All three stars recycle stereotypes they've played before. (Holden)

'VALIANT' (G, 80 minutes) Homing pigeons versus falcons are the combatants in this shoddily made animated movie about heroes and villains in World War II. The talents of many fine British actors are squandered in the voice-overs. (Holden)

'WAR OF THE WORLDS' (PG-13, 117 minutes) The aliens invade (again). Effectively scary and visually impressive. (Scott)

'WEDDING CRASHERS' (R, 113 minutes) A wink-wink, nudge-nudge Trojan horse of a story, this amiably raunchy sex comedy pivots on two Lotharios persuasively inhabited by Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn. They love the ladies but really and truly, cross their cheating hearts, just want a nice girl to call wife. Credited to the screenwriters Steve Faber and Bob Fisher. (Dargis)

QUEST (Tonight and tomorrow night) Formed in 1981 and disbanded a decade later, this acoustic quartet often shrouded its exploratory ethos in gauzy romanticism; now the saxophonist Dave Liebman and the pianist Richie Beirach, the ensemble's founding core, are regrouping with the bassist Ron McClure and the drummer Billy Hart for an intriguing update. 9 and 11, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)581-3080; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

ADAM ROGERS GROUP (Tonight and tomorrow night) As on ''Apparitions'' (Criss Cross), the latest album by the guitarist Adam Rogers, this band features serpentine melodic lines and a rock-informed rhythmic thrust. 9 and 10:30, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212)242-1063; cover, $15, members, $10. (Chinen)

JIMMY SCOTT 80TH-BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION (Tuesday through Sept. 25) Mr. Scott's piercing singing voice and achingly emotional style are rightfully enshrined in the annals of songbook interpretation; this weeklong celebration will feature him with quartet backing and a parade of guest stars, including the chanteuse Dee Dee Bridgewater (Tuesday and Wednesday) and the tap dance phenom Savion Glover (Thursday). 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212)475-8592; cover, $45 at tables, with a $5 minimum, or $30 at the bar, with a one-drink minimum.

 Opera

'LA BOHEME' (Thursday) Puccini's most popular opera returns to heavy rotation at the Metropolitan Opera in Franco Zeffirelli's lavish, audience-pleasing production. The dependable Hei-Kyung Hong will sing the part of Mimi, and Roberto Aronica will lend his sturdy tenor to the role of Rodolfo. The rest of the cast includes Alexandra Deshorties, Vladimir Chernov, Sebastian Catana and Richard Bernstein. Philippe Auguin conducts. 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000; $26 to $320. (Jeremy Eichler)

'CAPRICCIO' (Tonight and Sunday and Tuesday nights) Strauss's final opera, ''Capriccio'' poses an aesthetic question: In opera, which is more important, the words or the music? The issue is dramatized through a love triangle consisting of Flamand, a composer, and Olivier, a poet, who are vying for the affection of a young widow, Countess Madeleine, in 18th-century France. For all its ingenuity and musical refinement, the opera can seem chatty and inert. To lend the work more immediacy, the director Stephen Lawless updates the story to the mid-20th century and moves the setting from the countess's intimate salon to the inside of her fancy private opera house. Though the updating idea has its merits, Mr. Lawless turns the comedic scenes, which are already jarring, into laugh riots. Still, the cast, headed by the soprano Pamela Armstrong as the countess, is greatly appealing, and George Manahan conducts an assured and supple performance. Tonight at 8, Sunday at 1:30 p.m., Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500; $16 to $120. (Anthony Tommasini)

'MADAMA BUTTERFLY' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) New York City Opera presents Puccini's Japanese classic in one of its best productions, a stripped-down but still Japanese abstraction by Mark Lamos, the director, and the set designer Michael Yeargan. There's a lot to like here, from the intermittently good conducting of Ari Pelto (which may improve as he gets more time with the orchestra) to Jake Gardner's Sharpless; but the two leads, Brandon Jovanovich and Jee Hyun Lim, don't quite have the voices to pull off their roles. Tomorrow night at 8, Wednesday night at 7:30, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $16 to $120. (Anne Midgette)

'MANON' (Tuesday) Renee Fleming's explorations of repertory in recent years have taken her into coloratura roles in Handel and Bellini, far removed from the Mozart and Strauss lyric soprano repertory in which she first made her name. But the title role of Massenet's ''Manon'' remains central to her. In the past she has brought vocal radiance and piercing insight to her portrayal of the young heroine with a taste for finery who succumbs to the impulsive love of a dashing but shiftless chevalier. Ms. Fleming returns to the Metropolitan Opera to sing Manon in a revival of Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's 1987 production. The ardent tenor Marcelo Alvarez sings the Chevalier des Grieux. Jesus Lopez-Cobos conducts. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000; $26 to $320. (Tommasini)

METROPOLITAN OPERA: OPENING NIGHT GALA (Monday) Opening night at the Met offers acts from Mozart's ''Nozze di Figaro,'' Puccini's ''Tosca'' and Saint-Saens's ''Samson et Dalila.'' A big night with big ticket prices, with remaining seats at $250, $300, $600 and $1,000. 7 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000. (Bernard Holland)

'PATIENCE' (Tomorrow) Gilbert and Sullivan's tart sendup of Victorian aesthetes gets psychedelic treatment from Tazewell Thompson's production by the New York City Opera. Michael Ball and Kevin Burdette are worth the trip. 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)870-5570; $16 to $95.(Holland)

'TOSCA' (Tomorrow and Sunday) Diminutive, venerable and unbowed, the Amato Opera, a salty old-school denizen of New York, is presenting an even more venerable standby as the first production of its 58th season: Puccini's ''Tosca.'' Tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday afternoon at 2:30, Amato Opera, 319 Bowery, (212)228-8200; $30; 65+, students with ID and children, $25. (Midgette)

'IL VIAGGIO A REIMS' (Thursday) Conceived as an over-the-top tribute to a leading politician, which the composer withdrew after its premiere and recycled in several more normal operas, ''Viaggio'' is a wacky, unserious froth of delightful singing and slapstick. With 10 principal roles, it's a chance for New York City Opera to show off what it has in the way of voices: Cheryl Evans, Maria Kanyova, Daniel Mobbs and Marcus DeLoach are among the familiar faces, with Alison Tupay and Allyson McHardy among the debutantes. George Manahan, a capable conductor though no bel canto specialist, conducts. 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; remaining tickets: $16 to $95. (Midgette)

Classical Music

BARGEMUSIC (Tonight, tomorrow, Sunday and Thursday) Great views and typically fresh performances help make this floating concert hall one of the city's more inviting settings for chamber music. This weekend, a chamber orchestra called the Knights will somehow cram itself on and around the tiny barge stage for works by Mozart, Bartok, Brahms and Hossein Alizadeh. Thursday, a piano trio (David Salness, violin; Evelyn Elsing, cello; Rita Sloan, piano) takes over for music by Saint-Saens, Schumann and Shulamit Ran. Tonight, tomorrow night and Thursday night at 7:30; Sunday at 4 p.m.; Bargemusic, Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718)624-2083; $50; 62+, $40; Thursday, $35; 62+, $30. (Eichler)

CHOIR OF CLARE COLLEGE (Thursday) This choir, from Cambridge, is joining forces with the superb resident boys' choir at St. Thomas Church to celebrate the 60th birthday of John Rutter, the English choral composer. The program includes Mr. Rutter's Mass of the Children, as well as a new piece by Nico Muhly, a New York composer, and works by Britten, Harris and Howells. 7:30 p.m., St. Thomas Church, Fifth Avenue at 53rd Street, (212)664-9360; $15 to $60.(Allan Kozinn)

TON KOOPMAN YOUNG ARTISTS CONCERT (Monday) Mr. Koopman, a Dutch Bach specialist, has been spending the week tutoring an international group of talented young choristers and instrumentalists in Baroque performance style in a workshop sponsored by Carnegie Hall. Here, in performances of Bach's Cantatas Nos. 6, 146 and 198, they show off the results, which, to judge from early returns in rehearsal, should be impressive. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800; $15. (James R. Oestreich)

NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Wednesday and Thursday) Lorin Maazel and his orchestra are opening the season with a burst of flashy pianism and mainstream Romantic grandeur. On opening night, the Russian virtuoso Evgeny Kissin plays the Beethoven ''Emperor'' Concerto on a program that also includes two Strauss works: ''Don Juan'' and the ''Rosenkavalier'' Suite. And to open the orchestra's subscription series, on Thursday, the kinetic Chinese pianist Lang Lang joins Mr. Maazel and the orchestra for the Chopin Piano Concerto No. 1 on the first part of a program otherwise devoted to the Mahler First Symphony. Wednesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m.; there is also an open rehearsal on Thursday at 9:45 a.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)875-5656; both concerts are sold out, but returned tickets may be available at the box office. Tickets for the rehearsal are $15. (Kozinn)

BEVERLY BLOSSOM'S 'INCOMPLETE LAMENT OF AN OLD DANCER' (Tonight and tomorrow) At 79, the inexhaustible Ms. Blossom is a testament to the power of true theatrical presence. Her new work is divided into two parts: ''Lessons About Swansongs'' and ''Cello Lessons.'' They are likely to be lessons worth learning. 8 p.m., Bernie West Theater, Baruch Performing Arts Center, 17 Lexington Avenue, at 23rd Street, ninth floor, (646)312-4085; $25. (Roslyn Sulcas)

BREAKING GROUND: A DANCE CHARETTE (Tomorrow) Under the auspices of Dancing in the Streets, an organization that celebrates urban life by presenting performances in public spaces, five choreographers -- Ann Carlson, Eiko & Koma, Larry Keigwin, Tere O'Connor and Jawole Willa Jo Zollar -- will each present 5- to 10-minute site-specific works at the Tobacco Warehouse in Brooklyn. The artists began work on their pieces on Monday, when they were taken to the site for the first time. Whether or not the warehouse proves inspirational, this is an intriguing grouping of artists and an opportunity to see a sampler of their work. 2 and 4 p.m., Tobacco Warehouse, Empire-Fulton Ferry State Park, Brooklyn, (212)625-3505, www.dancinginthestreets.org; free. (Sulcas)

MARTITA GOSHEN (Sept. 22 through Sept. 25) A new piece, ''Breathing Water Breathing Eye'' from a choreographer who has long expressed her environmental concerns through her work.

KEIKO FUJI DANCE COMPANY (Tomorrow) In her new ''Mirror,'' Ms. Fuji, who is from Japan, tells the story of a woman so inconspicuous that she has no reflection in mirrors, becoming visible and vibrant only as a criminal. 8 p.m., Kaye Playhouse, 68th Street between Park and Lexington Avenues, (212)772-4448; $25; students and 65+, $15. (Dunning)

BILL T. JONES/ARNIE ZANE DANCE COMPANY (Wednesday and Sept. 23 and 24) The world premiere of Mr. Jones's full-evening ''Blind Date, which will reportedly address the subject of patriotism and its uses and misuses. 7:30 p.m., Montclair State University, Alexander Kasser Theater, College Avenue and Red Hawk Road, Montclair, N.J., (973)655-5112 or www.montclair.edu/kasser; $35. (Rockwell)

NOEMIE LAFRANCE'S 'AGORA' (Through Sept. 24) A huge, abandoned old city pool is the latest setting for Ms. Lafrance's imaginative site-specific dance.

(Dunning)

DAVID NEUMANN AND THE ADVANCED BEGINNER GROUP (Through Sunday) Mr. Neumann is a funny, deadpan performer who specializes in a particular brand of physical wit that combines the slapstick with the sly. In ''tough, the tough,'' which was created in collaboration with the composer Hal Hartley and the playwright Will Eno, he takes a look at life's daily routines. 8:30 p.m., Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212)674-8194; $15. (Sulcas)

*PHILADANCO (Tuesday through Sept. 25) The program sounds almost as terrific as the sleek, propulsive dancers of this august Philadelphia-based modern-dance troupe, with new dances by Ronald K. Brown, Lynne Taylor Corbett and Jawole Willa Jo Zollar, and Geoffrey Holder's seldom seen ''Blues and the Bible: 'Genesis.''' Tuesday through Friday at 8 p.m.; Sept. 24 at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sept. 25 at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)242-0800 or www.joyce.org; $36. (Dunning)

*RIVER TO RIVER: EVENING STARS (Tonight and tomorrow) You can't get much starrier than Merce Cunningham, whose company will perform the new ''Batteryparkevent'' tonight at 7:30.

The closing program in this free outdoor festival is ''Urban Remix,'' tomorrow at 7:30 p.m., which will feature Rennie Harris Puremovement, Momix, Electric Boogaloos, Bill Shannon and the winners of the Urban Freestyle Dance Contest that will be held on the festival site from 3 to 5 p.m. Take a blanket or a chair.

 Museums

*BROOKLYN MUSEUM: LUCE CENTER FOR AMERICAN ART VISIBLE STORAGE/STUDY CENTER Sleek vitrines house 1,500 objects from four departments, representing 15 centuries of art and design of the Americas. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718)638-5000. (Roberta Smith)

COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'EXTREME TEXTILES,' through Oct. 30. Don't look for aesthetic pizazz in this intensely techy show of industrial fibers and fabrics, but don't rule it out. The show's raison d'etre is solely use, but a lot of what's on view, in the first museum display of material made to function in extreme conditions, is visually exciting. 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400.(Grace Glueck)

METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE BISHOP JADES,' through Feb. 12. Jade has been treasured since ancient times, though the almost preposterously exquisite objects on display in the Met's reinstalled galleries for Chinese decorative arts date from the 18th century, when the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) brought Chinese jade work to a peak of virtuosity. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Holland Cotter)

*MET: 'MATISSE: THE FABRIC OF DREAMS -- HIS ART AND HIS TEXTILES,' through Sept. 25. This somewhat scattered yet astounding exhibition demonstrates that as African sculptures were to the Cubists, so textiles were to Matisse and revolutionizes the understanding of his life and work. (See above.) (Smith)

EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'THE (S) FILES/THE SELECTED FILES 05,' through Jan. 29. The definition of what ''Latino art'' means is changing in a post-identity-politics time, and this modest biennial, drawn mostly from unsolicited proposals submitted by artists in the greater New York area, is an indicator of what that change looks like. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212)831-7272. (Cotter)

MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'THE NEXT GENERATION: CONTEMPORARY EXPRESSIONS OF FAITH,' through Nov. 13. Works in this juried show of artists who belong to the organization Christians in the Visual Arts range from traditional paintings and sculptures to an interactive video and photo documentation of a shamanistic performance in the woods. Ambitious, optically captivating collages by Mary Fielding McCleary and Anita Breitenberg Naylor are among the few pieces that exceed familiar generic limitations. 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, (212)408-1500. (Ken Johnson)

BRONX MUSEUM OF THE ARTS: 'AIM 25/ARTIST IN THE MARKETPLACE,' through Oct. 30. This show is the culminating event of an annual 12-week museum residency that focuses on the mechanics of career development. The work is as diverse as the backgrounds of the more than 30 artists, who all live in New York, though many were born elsewhere, including Brazil, Croatia, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, Libya, Mexico and the Philippines. 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, (718)681-6000. (Cotter)

MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'NEW YORK CHANGING: DOUGLAS LEVERE REVISITS BERENICE ABBOTT'S NEW YORK,' through Nov. 13 . During the 1930's, the Modernist photographer Berenice Abbott photographed the architectural fabric of New York City with a keen eye for contrasts of new and old. Between 1997 and 2003, Douglas Levere returned to the scenes that she photographed and photographed them again. Seeing 50 of his paired with her originals is a fascinating education in how things change. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212)534-1672. (Johnson)

MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'MOUNT ST. HELENS: PHOTOGRAPHS BY FRANK GOHLKE,' through Sept. 26. A year after the eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington in 1980, this well-known landscape photographer began documenting the explosion's effect on the surrounding terrain. His expansive black-and-white pictures are formally and technically impeccable, but because they err on the side of understatement, they only partly convey a sense of the volcano's destructive violence. 11 West 53rd Street, (212)708-9400. (Johnson)

NATIONAL ACADEMY MUSEUM: JEAN HELION, through Oct. 9. Helion's conversion, around 1940, from a suave, smartly synthetic mode of geometric abstraction to a like-minded figurative style doesn't put him in a league with great 20th-century apostates like Giacometti, Picabia or Guston. Still, he produced a weirdly fascinating body of work that influenced Americans before and after World War II. This meager show does not give a full account of his strengths or weaknesses, but is well worth a look. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)369-4880. (Smith)

P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'GREATER NEW YORK 2005,' through Sept. 26. A youth-besotted, cheerful, immodestly ingratiating, finally disappointing survey of contemporary art, perusing a scene whose wide stylistic range, emphasis on drawing, persistent teenage infatuations and overall dexterousness are firmly entrenched characteristics of the marketplace. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-2084. (Michael Kimmelman)

QUEENS MUSEUM OF ART: 'DOWN THE GARDEN PATH: THE ARTIST'S GARDEN AFTER MODERNISM,' through Nov. 6. This big, messy and uneven show, still a thought-provoking one for patient and interested viewers, surveys how artists like Vito Acconci, Ian Hamilton Finlay, Mel Chin, Ghada Amer, Stan Douglas and many more have cultivated gardens in fantasy and in reality. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718)592-9700.(Johnson)

* STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'SCRATCH: 2004-2005 ARTISTS-IN-RESIDENCE: WILLIAM CORDOVA, MICHAEL QUEENLAND AND MARC ANDRE ROBINSON,' through Oct. 23 . Rap, religion, Minimalism and Malcolm X all figure in this intricate, multilayered show of work by the three young residents, organized by the museum's associate curator, Christine Y. Kim. 144 West 125th Street, (212)864-4500. (Cotter)

WHITNEY MUSEUM: 'REMOTE VIEWING,' through Oct. 9. The vast information overload the world struggles with -- scientific theory, technological data, geopolitical facts, historical material and on and on -- is whipped into visual cosmologies by eight painters of widely different approaches and sensibilities. If the premise is fuzzy, the show has some sharp art, including Carroll Dunham's witty ''Solar Eruption,'' a giant, battered yellow sun that suggests a cell invaded by virus particles, its perimeter bursting with splatlike -- and sometimes unseemly -- extrusions. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212)570-3600 (Glueck)

*WHITNEY MUSEUM: ROBERT SMITHSON, through Oct. 23. Who knows whether Smithson is the most influential American postwar artist, as this show claims. Consisting mostly of drawings, photographs and films (he didn't make that many sculptures, not ones that could fit into a museum, anyway), this is the first full-scale overview of him in the country. It is consequently dry but still compelling testimony to a great exuberance cut drastically short when Smithson died at 35 in a plane crash in 1973. Self-appointed spokesman for earth art, and scavenger of dirt, shells, slag and other materials from the industrial landscape, he helped to shove Minimalism, Conceptualism and Pop in various messy new directions during the 1960's and early 70's. Today, in an era of crabbed imagination and short-term profiteering, the sheer chutzpah of an artist like him is instructive. (See above.) (Kimmelman)

WHITNEY MUSEUM : BANKS VIOLETTE, through Oct. 2. In this labor-intensive installation, Romanticism, tragic violence and rock 'n' roll are evoked as much by the detailed wall label as by the ghostly beams of a burned-out church made of gleaming salt. (See above.) (Smith)

WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART AT ALTRIA: 'PAST PRESENCE: CHILDHOOD AND MEMORY,' through Oct. 13. This modestly resonant show of works relating to juvenile experience presents a glass cabinet filled with 2,000 miniature white ceramic vessels by Charles LeDray; small, finely drawn, photo-based pictures of children by Peggy Preheim; drawings copied from hunting manuals by Robert Beck; and a politically suggestive chalkboard drawing by Gary Simmons. 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917)663-2453. (Johnson)

Galleries: Uptown

'BEYOND GEOGRAPHY: FORTY YEARS OF VISUAL ARTS AT THE AMERICAS SOCIETY' Anyone who wants to view art from a hemispheric perspective should see this review of four decades of adventurous art exhibiting by an organization founded to promote understanding among the nations of North, South and Central America. Works here range from a beautiful, all-gold Inca mask to a sound installation by the Canadian avant-garde filmmaker Michael Snow. Americas Society, 680 Park Avenue, at 68th Street, (212)249-8950, through Oct. 8. (Johnson)

MAURICE FREEDMAN: 'A RETROSPECTIVE' Though his paintings are not widely recognized today, Freedman (1904-85) enjoyed considerable success in pre-Abstract Expressionist New York for engagingly blending influences of Max Beckmann and Marsden Hartley.

HEADLINE: Energy Prices Lead Inflation, Overcoming Salary Increases

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
Higher energy prices took a sizable bite out of consumers' wallets in August as inflation rose and negated the value of wage increases, the government reported yesterday. 
 The Consumer Price Index increased 0.5 percent last month over July, mostly because of higher gasoline and energy costs, the Labor Department said. The so-called core rate of the index, which excludes energy and food, rose only 0.1 percent, less than the 0.2 percent economists had expected. 
Compared with August 2004, prices rose 3.6 percent over all and 2.1 percent excluding food and energy. 
 In the New York area, the Consumer Price Index rose 0.8 percent for the month compared with July, with energy prices up 3.2 percent and apparel prices up 7.2 percent as designers introduced new fall lines.
 Nationally, inflation effectively lowered the average weekly earnings by 0.5 percent in August for about four-fifths of American workers who are in manufacturing or nonsupervisory jobs, according to a separate Labor Department report. 
 Energy prices as a whole rose 5 percent, with gasoline prices jumping 8.3 percent in August, a number that will be even higher this month because of the price spikes after Hurricane Katrina.
 Americans will probably react to higher energy prices by cutting spending, but such cutbacks are typically delayed because consumers do not know whether the current higher prices will persist or abate with time, said Anthony Chan, an economist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. 
 ''They are already cutting back because last year wasn't a great year for energy prices and this year is even worse,'' he said. ''They have never seen gasoline prices this high.''
 Consumers have weathered higher energy prices so far because the economy is creating new jobs, something that will need to continue to blunt the higher gasoline prices. 
 If oil keeps rising, ''this will be devastating for consumers, but if it's for a month or two and prices are flat to down, it's manageable as long as the labor market keeps generating jobs,'' said James O'Sullivan, an economist at UBS.
 So far, the higher energy prices have not driven up prices of other goods and services, because businesses have been competing aggressively, but they might soon have to start passing on higher energy costs to customers through higher prices, economists said.
 More than half the businesses surveyed in two reports by the Federal Reserve Bank's New York and Philadelphia branches said their costs were rising at the fastest pace in months.
 Businesses in New York were generally optimistic about future prospects this month, albeit less so than in August.

HEADLINE: Storm Might Be a Factor As Fed Ponders a Rate Rise

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 14 

 BODY:
At least so far, Hurricane Katrina does not appear to have blown the Federal Reserve off course.
 As policy makers gear up to decide on interest rates on Tuesday, they are confronting a big short-term shock to the economy but most of the same long-term economic trends that existed before the hurricane.
 The economic data for the period before the storm suggested that consumer spending held up despite rising gas prices, that companies were still hiring and that inflation pressures remained a cause for worry. 
 Many economists expect that trend to resume after a predictable drop in growth as a result of hurricane-related disruptions. On top of that, the Bush administration and Congress are about to rev up the economy with a staggering amount of federal money for relief and reconstruction. 
 Many lawmakers are now predicting that the federal cost of Katrina could hit $200 billion -- more than 10 times the amount for any other natural disaster. None of that spending, or the tax cuts being rushed through Congress, is likely to be offset by reduced spending in other areas.
 It remains possible that the Federal Reserve will refrain from raising short-term interest rates next Tuesday, which would be the first time in 11 meetings that it held rates steady. The best reason to do that would be to wait for more evidence of the impact from the hurricane and the spike in gasoline prices in the last two weeks. 
 But that would be little more than a pause. Fed officials are likely to repeat past declarations that their policy is ''accommodative,'' meaning that interest rates are still below normal and need to go higher, and they are likely to repeat their desire to raise rates at a ''measured'' pace.
 ''The main point is that when they sit down, they will conclude that what we want to do is to continue to remove the accommodative policy,'' said Peter Kretzmer, senior economist at Bank of America. 
 Several pieces of new data on Thursday offered the Fed reasons to tread carefully.
 Two surveys of manufacturers, by the Federal Reserve banks of Philadelphia and of New York, showed a big drop in new orders and expectations for the months ahead. 
 The surveys suggested that higher energy prices had begun to reduce expectations. 
 Asked by the Philadelphia Fed about the impact of energy prices, 58.1 percent of companies said they had had a slightly negative effect and 22.6 percent said they had had a moderately negative effect.
 ''The manufacturing executives who responded to the survey were significantly less optimistic about future growth this month,'' said Michael Trebing, a senior analyst at the Philadelphia Fed. 
 But Mr. Trebing cautioned that the surveys provided limited guidance, noting that the Philadelphia barometer plunged in June and bounced back in July and August.
 In a separate report, the Labor Department reported Thursday that the underlying rate of inflation was surprisingly mild in August. Consumer prices jumped 0.5 percent, mostly because of gasoline prices. 
 The core rate of inflation, excluding food and energy, was only 0.1 percent in August, and those prices were up only 2.1 percent for the year.
 Fed officials tend to view jumps in energy prices as one-time events rather than a source of permanent inflation, and a low rate of core inflation is normally a cause for relief.
 But many economists predicted on Thursday that high energy prices would lead to higher prices generally, and that core inflation was likely to be much higher in September.
 Fed officials were already worried about other sources of inflation, like rising wages and slowing productivity growth, and several policy makers have expressed concern that high energy prices could lead to expectations of higher long-term inflation.
 ''Rising oil prices, like other unfavorable price shocks, can also feed through and raise underlying core inflation,'' Michael Moskow, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, warned on Sept. 7. ''So there is also a risk on the inflation front, and the risk is higher now than it was a year ago.''
 Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers and a former Fed governor, predicted on Thursday that Hurricane Katrina would lead to only a temporary slowdown in economic growth and employment.
 ''Katrina's effects may reduce growth in the short run, but the longer-term growth trajectory remains in place,'' Mr. Bernanke said in a speech to the National Press Club.
 The problem for Fed officials is that the data so far provide no conclusive evidence about the full economic impact of Katrina and the energy price shock. 
 If the impact on growth is small, a decision to keep interest rates low could aggravate inflation. If high energy prices pinch spending and shatter confidence, higher interest rates could add to the problem.
 But as one analyst pointed out, there is nothing the Federal Reserve can do to speed the repair of oil refineries along the Gulf of Mexico or to accelerate job creation for people evacuated from New Orleans.

HEADLINE: Partnership Formed to Build Nuclear Plants

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 15 

 BODY:
After a gap of three decades in orders for nuclear power plants, two companies interested in building new ones announced Thursday that they had formed a partnership intended to create a new business model for the industry.
 Areva, a French-owned nuclear company with links to the reactor technology developed by Westinghouse and Babcock & Wilcox, and Constellation Energy, a Baltimore company that operates five reactors in Maryland and New York, said they would work together to manufacture, construct and then operate a reactor, and would retain partial ownership, selling the rest to a utility company or other investor.
The two companies enlisted Bechtel, an architect-engineering firm with extensive nuclear experience, to join the project, called UniStar Nuclear. 
 Almost all the nuclear reactors in operation in this country were built when a utility ordered the parts from a manufacturer, hired a company to build the plant and then learned on its own to run it, a system that contributed to huge cost overruns and operating problems. 
 In July, Congress approved sweeping energy legislation that offers substantial subsidies for building new reactors. Even before that, many companies expressed interest in building reactors because the primary competing fuel, natural gas, had become so expensive and because of uncertainty about future regulations regarding coal plants.
 The new model is intended to cut the risk to investors, who were badly hurt in the 1980's when delays and technical problems pushed the price of some reactors to 8 or 10 times the original estimates. The goal is to build groups of identical reactors, taking advantage of economies of scale.
 In another step to limit risk, Areva said it would use a new procedure developed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to have a reactor design approved before construction. The company would use a 1,600-megawatt design that is under construction in Olkiluoto, Finland. That plant is being built in partnership with Siemens, the German nuclear company.
 When America's existing reactors were ordered, the practice was to seek a license while construction was under way. Regulators would then order design changes after the welders and concrete pourers had done their work, and no two plants ended up alike.
 ''UniStar Nuclear will pioneer a path that will help bring a new generation of nuclear power plants a major step closer to reality,'' said Michael J. Wallace, executive vice president of Constellation. ''At the heart of UniStar Nuclear is a one-stop shopping approach to developing and deploying nuclear power plants. UniStar will provide an unprecedented level of certainty for energy companies and others contemplating new plants.'' 
 Areva is an owner of two French nuclear power companies, and in recent years its has bought Exxon Nuclear, the Yankee Atomic Engineering Company and the nuclear division of Babcock & Wilcox. Areva has 8,000 employees in the United States and is the largest provider of services to nuclear plants in this country.
 Constellation named two possible sites for a new reactor: Calvert Cliffs, Md., where it has two reactors, and Nine Mile Point, near Oswego, N.Y., where it has two more. Ground could be broken by 2010, with operation in 2015, the partnership said. 
 The reactor is described as ''evolutionary,'' meaning that it would be built on the same general lines as current reactors, but with improvements to make it simpler and more reliable.
 For example, while most reactors have two sets of emergency pipes and pumps, the Areva design has four, to ensure that the reactor can keep running while one set is out of service for maintenance or repair. It has 47 percent fewer valves and 16 percent fewer pumps.
 The youngest nuclear plant in the United States entered service in 1995. The last plant ordered, not counting those canceled before completion, was in 1973.
 Rising construction costs, the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania and the 1986 explosion at Chernobyl in the Ukraine, as well as cheap natural gas, combined to make the utilities look to other sources. But the day of cheap fuel is gone, and the accidents are decades in the past. Many industry executives said they want to build more plants if there can be some assurance of controlling the costs.

HEADLINE: Little Change in Market Amid Inflation Concerns

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks were little changed yesterday as two Federal Reserve reports on manufacturing stirred concern that the economy was slowing and inflation accelerating in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.
 The evidence of weakness in the Philadelphia area and New York State weighed on the market as oil prices fell further from records.
 Time Warner rose on New York Post and Wall Street Journal reports that the company was in talks to sell a stake in America Online to Microsoft. 
 ''We're going to see some really messy economic data in the next couple of months, so it's not going to be real clear what the economy is doing,'' said John P. Waterman, who helps manage about $8 billion as chief investment officer at Rittenhouse Asset Management in Radnor, Pa. ''What Katrina does is add uncertainty.''
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.57 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,227.73. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 3.18 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,146.15.
 A rally in shares of McDonald's helped lift the Dow Jones industrial average, which gained 13.85 points, or 0.1 percent, to 10,558.75.
 The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 0.05 percentage point, to 4.21 percent.
 Today's economic reports were the first to show the effects of the hurricane, which struck the Gulf Coast on Aug. 29.
 The Fed Bank of Philadelphia's general economic index for September declined to 2.2, from 17.5 last month. A number greater than zero means a higher percentage of the area's factories surveyed reported business was improving than deteriorating.
 The New York Fed's Empire index of general business conditions in manufacturing in September slipped to 17, from 23 in August. The gauge of prices paid for materials jumped to 53.4, the highest since March, from 29 last month.
 Signs of a pickup in inflation may reduce the likelihood that the Fed will pause its interest rate increases even after the storm, the most expensive natural disaster in American history with estimated costs of $100 billion, prompted some economists to cut their economic growth forecasts for this quarter.
 Fed policy makers meet next Tuesday, when economists expect policy makers to raise the benchmark lending rate an 11th consecutive time, by a quarter point, to 3.75 percent.
 ''You're getting over the emotional response to the hurricane,'' said Tim Smalls, head of United States trading at Execution in Greenwich, Conn. 
 McDonald's, the world's largest restaurant chain, climbed $1.09, or 3.4 percent, to $33.45. The company said fewer than 100 of its restaurants in the Gulf Coast region remain closed because of damage caused by the hurricane.
 A drop in crude prices also helped support stocks. Oil for October delivery lost 0.5 percent, to $64.75 a barrel.

HEADLINE: Jihad's Fresh Face

BYLINE: By Waleed Ziad. 
Waleed Ziad is an economic consultant and a principal in the Truman National Security Project.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
OF the many questions surrounding Egypt's presidential elections last week -- Were opposition candidates unfairly removed from the ballot? Did the ruling party of President Hosni Mubarak cheat at the polls? -- a more general query has gone largely unmentioned: Did this election, or the other recent democratic experiments in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere, really further American aims in the Muslim world? 
 The answer is troubling. The post-9/11 prevailing wisdom has held that military force and exporting democracy are the West's twin weapons against terrorism. Islamic fundamentalism is the product of a ''medieval'' mindset, we are told, and if we can deliver elections to the Arab world, our enemies will cower before the spirit of the Enlightenment. 
Yet the establishment of the first popularly elected governments in Iraqi and Afghan history has been followed by more suicide bombings and unabated violence. And nobody expects real change, in terms of political freedoms or human rights, any time soon in Saudi Arabia or Egypt. What are we missing? 
 While there is no doubt that elections are a worthy goal, we will not be able to change the Muslim world or dislodge the militancy until we gain a better understanding of the roots of the problem. While these conflicts are often painted as millennium-old, they are essentially modern phenomena, bred of postcolonial politics, social upheavals and territorial struggles.
 And as we look at the causes of anti-Western jihadism, we tend to overlook one major contributing factor: the absence not just of democracy but also of grass-roots representative institutions like a free press and independent political, cultural and social-welfare institutions. 
 Today's jihadists -- I call them ''neo-fundamentalists,'' because they are a world apart from earlier fundamentalists -- are not throwbacks to the crusades, nor are they, as President Bush unfortunately put it, just ''a group of folks.'' They are a singular and recent byproduct of decades of oppressive rule. 
 Yes, the Muslim world had an unfortunate introduction to post-Enlightenment ideals, which came in the context of invasion, colonialism and exploitation. But the Arab philosophical and political movement that came out of that experience was not inherently anti-Western. In fact, in traditional Islamic thought the concept of violent resistance against an unjust ruler was virtually unheard of; for classical jurists, tyranny was preferable to the anarchy that accompanies revolt. 
 The first wave of modern Islamic fundamentalists, which crested primarily in Egypt in the late 19th century and included such figures as the Iranian-born reformer Jamal al-Din al-Afghani and his Egyptian disciple, Muhammad Abduh, opposed colonialism but saw no incompatibility between Islamic and Western philosophy, law or scientific method. These men called for political reform and the revival of free inquiry.
 The big change did not occur until the middle of the 20th century. In states like Egypt, Iraq and Syria, colonial governments were replaced by military, Arab-nationalist, royalist or Soviet-sponsored socialist regimes. All deteriorated quickly into dictatorships, emracing the institutions of colonial subjugation.
 A host of political parties and civic institutions were founded to challenge the autocrats; many combined Enlightenment concepts like public participation with Islamic ideals of popular consent and justice. Even Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood (founded in 1928) was not a militant revolutionary group; instead it promoted social-welfare programs, democracy and land reform on the Western model. When the mass movements became influential, however, they were answered not by reform but by persecution, ranging from the violent crackdown against the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt in the 1950's to the massacre of more than 10,000 dissidents by the dictator Hafez al-Assad in Hama, Syria, in 1982. 
 The story of Sayyid Qutb, the father of neo-fundamentalism, exemplifies what happened next. Qutb was an Egyptian teacher trained in the Western system. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, it was not his trip to America in 1948 that radicalized him. While he was shocked by some aspects of American culture, like women dancing in public, he returned to write about the importance of emulating the educational, economic and scientific achievements of the West.
 BUT in the 1950's, he was jailed and tortured for speaking out against Gamal Abdel Nasser's autocracy, while scores of dissidents were executed. Only then did he decide that violence could be used against an unjust government. He spoke as a Muslim, but his rhetoric was grounded in Western-nationalist and leftist revolutionary principles. His call had great resonance, and thus was neo-fundamentalism born. 
 As persecution continued across the Arab world, the neo-fundamentalist rhetoric became more Manichean and xenophobic. With mainstream opponents silenced, ultraradicals became the loudest voices of dissent. In Egypt, for example, those who emerged from prison in the 1970's formed militant organizations, including Al Jihad, led by Ayman al-Zawahiri, who is now chief lieutenant for Osama bin Laden. These men were not thinkers or theologians; rather, many were disillusioned Westernized professionals, former leftists and nationalists.
 This new wave of fundamentalism, unlike all the others before it in the Islamic tradition, is inherently anti-intellectual and reactive; it is more reminiscent of the anarchical movements of 19th-century Russia. This ''Islamism'' is nihilistic, expressing a lack of faith in all political systems, in history, and in all past social developments. The jihadists justify their actions by claiming that they are returning to ''pure'' Islamic sources to establish a ''government of God.'' Of course, the paradox here is that the Koran does not lay down a mode of governance. What perhaps we in the United States do not understand is that in rejecting the status quo, these groups demonize not just the West, but mainstream Islamic culture and philosophy as well; they pose perhaps the greatest existential threat to 1,400 years of Islamic tradition.
 So how does this history help us reverse the trend? It requires that we look at the jihadists not as an ancient foe, but as yet another contemporary terrorist group. Recent history -- in northern India, Sri Lanka, Kurdish Turkey -- has taught us that grassroots democracy and allowing the aggrieved group a public voice can be effective weapons against terrorism. A good strategy would be to support groups across the Muslim world, both secular and religious, that provide social services where the government falls short; they range from women's rights organizations like the Union for Feminine Action in Morocco to trade groups like the Lebanese Businessmen Association.
 We must foster these organizations -- along with a free press and educational and cultural institutions. At the same time, our corporations should guide local entrepreneurs to promote a free market, the backbone of democracy. If anything is going to come of the neoconservative hope of making Iraq into a beacon of our values, it will be along these lines. 
 It is vital, however, that we not be put off from helping organizations tied to Islam -- faith-based parties calling for peaceful democratic reforms are emerging across the Muslim world as the main political opposition. They are the necessary counterweights to central governments, and without them, autocratic rule, and the neo-fundamentalism that it breeds, will remain the norm.

HEADLINE: In Detroit, a Bitter Battle for the Mayor's Seat

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 15 

 BODY:
Never mind the 15.9 percent unemployment. Never mind that this city was just given the humiliating title of being the nation's poorest major city. Mayor Kwame M. Kilpatrick was not the first Detroit mayor in nearly 50 years to place second in a primary because of the economy.
 Instead, political observers here say, the mayoral race has turned on Mr. Kilpatrick's personal and political missteps. And on Thursday, at a debate that was supposed to focus on the economy, the topic quickly shifted to his image. 
The city is hurt if ''activities associated with the mayor, whether they be true or not true, get splattered in an unflattering way around the national media,'' declared Freman Hendrix, who outpolled Mr. Kilpatrick in the nonpartisan August primary. The election is Nov. 8.
 Faced with a $300 million deficit, Detroit is shrinking its city government in what both Mr. Kilpatrick and Mr. Hendrix characterize as a race against looming federal receivership. But many here have questioned whether Mr. Kilpatrick, who faces questions about his use of a credit card issued by the city and his use of public money to lease a Lincoln Navigator for his wife, is up to the job. 
 It is a point the mayor acknowledged on Thursday. ''The question many of you had for me is, Could I manage the business of city government?'' he said.
 Mr. Kilpatrick described the condition of the city he inherited from former Mayor Dennis Archer as dilapidated and horrific. ''The city is on the move,'' he said. ''We have a long way to go, but we've come from a mighty long way.'' 
 The comments were directed at Mr. Hendrix, a deputy to Mr. Archer. 
 Mr. Hendrix replied, ''I listen to Mr. Kilpatrick, and I think sometimes he's in a parallel universe.''
 The debate between the men, both Democrats, became harsh almost immediately. Mr. Kilpatrick, who was on the defensive from the moment he began his opening statement, drew a few groans from the crowd when he appeared to suggest that Mr. Hendrix had a criminal past. 
 Responding to a question about how the image of a mayor affects investment in the city, Mr. Kilpatrick said: ''I have never been arrested. I have never come in contact with anybody in the criminal justice process. And I -- me or my family -- and I just want to know, Can Mr. Hendrix say the same thing?''
 After the debate, Mr. Kilpatrick said that he had no reason to suspect that Mr. Hendrix had committed a crime, and that he was only making a point about the need for transparency in the campaign.
 Mr. Hendrix said neither he nor any of his family members had ever been arrested. 
 ''It sounds to me like the ploy of a desperate man who is down in the polls,'' he told reporters.
 According to the most recent data from a Michigan polling firm, EPIC-MRA, Mr. Hendrix has slightly widened his 10-point lead of the primary. Ed Sarpolus, the vice president of EPIC-MRA, said a tracking poll showed 53 percent of voters supporting Mr. Hendrix and 41 percent supporting Mr. Kilpatrick.
 ''If it wasn't for his personal foibles, then we'd be looking at a close race but a race where the mayor would be re-elected,'' Mr. Sarpolus said. ''The No.1 issue in the city is the mayor. It's not the schools. It's not the economy or jobs.''
 When Mr. Kilpatrick was elected four years ago, many voters saw him as a natural leader who could usher in the progress that Detroiters have been awaiting for decades. Rebuilding that image may be difficult.
 ''He has charisma and that's one of the reasons he's done so well,'' said Lyke Thompson, director of the center for urban studies at Wayne State University in Detroit. ''But the car and all these other issues have been a challenge and have raised issues about his credibility.''

HEADLINE: New Orleans to Open Some Neighborhoods

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY; Bill Dawson contributed reporting from Houston for this article, Andrew C. Revkin from New York and Timothy Williams from Baton Rouge, La.

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Sept. 15 

 BODY:
More than two weeks after Hurricane Katrina devastated this city and prompted a mass evacuation, Mayor C. Ray Nagin announced a plan on Thursday for as many as 180,000 residents and business owners to return -- at least during the daylight hours.
 Mayor Nagin, emphasizing that city services are still minimal, said that residents in certain areas could return to collect belongings and assess damage to their property but that they would be asked to leave at the end of each day.
 The tentative re-entry plan calls for residents to be allowed into the Algiers neighborhood by the weekend. Uptown would be accessible by the middle of next week and the French Quarter on Sept. 26. The city's downtown and the other three areas will be open to business owners over the weekend. All are areas that suffered less damage from the storm. But, city officials said, the schedules may change. 
 ''Our strategy is to repopulate the city in the safest areas first and to get enough critical mass going so that the economics of this center city start to flow,'' Mayor Nagin said. ''Then, simultaneously, we will be involved in probably the biggest urban reconstruction project in the country's history.''
 But the mayor and other officials conceded that the details of how the plan would work remained unclear.
 City Attorney Sherry S. Landry acknowledged that some residents might try to stay, and she said those who were out on the streets after dusk might be escorted from the city by military personnel.
 Mayor Nagin said he hoped to have a computer system at entry points to track re-entering residents by Social Security number, date of birth and address. ''Everybody's going to want to come,'' he said.
 On Thursday, as the death toll from the storm statewide rose to 558, few traffic lights were working. Most water was undrinkable. A makeshift 911 system was still being run by the military. Floodwaters and sludge remained a health risk.
 Power was being restored in some areas that are part of the plan, but not in others. 
 Still, the tentative re-entry plan was one of several signs that conditions were improving. In Houston, the Astrodome, which on Sept. 4 housed 17,500 evacuees, was vacated on Thursday. Many of its remaining 779 inhabitants were moved a short distance across a parking lot to Reliant Arena, part of the same complex. Other evacuees were moved out of the complex to residences.
 The people remaining in another part in the complex, Reliant Center, are to be moved on Friday into the Arena, officials said. 
 In New Orleans, Mayor Nagin said that as many as half of the city's 160,000 homes might have to be destroyed, but that electricity is being restored rapidly to areas that can be saved, and minimal hospital and emergency services will soon be available.
 The re-entry announcement came as officials of the Army Corps of Engineer warned that even in a moderate storm the repaired levees might not prevent new flooding. 
 Daniel Hitchings, regional business director of the Mississippi Valley Division of the Corps of Engineers, said the levees would be repaired to their prestorm standard by next June -- in time for the 2006 hurricane season.
 Mr. Hitchings said that water might breach some levees during a new rainstorm but that the flooding would not be ''life threatening.'' Some houses in New Orleans, he pointed out, flood even ''in a two-inch storm.''
 Mr. Hitchings said that Mayor Nagin had been briefed about the possibility of new flooding. Rainfall has been uncommonly low since the storm, allowing the Corps of Engineers to drain floodwaters faster than it expected. 
 Experts have met in Vicksburg, Miss., to consider how to armor the city against any hurricanes that might head for the damaged city.
 One stopgap measure mentioned by some in the Corps of Engineers would create a wall atop the earth levees by driving corrugated metal into the soil and then capping the protruding metal with concrete.
 After residents move into less damaged areas, Mayor Nagin said, those from heavily damaged areas, like the Lower Ninth Ward, will be given first preference to return. The government will ''make sure that there are places for them,'' he added.
 While returning residents may find a city vastly different from the one they fled, crime is now essentially nonexistent, the mayor said. ''This city for the first time that anyone can probably imagine is drug free and violence free, and we are intent on keeping that way,'' the mayor said.

HEADLINE: So Many Evacuees and, Luckily, So Many Apartments in Cities of Refuge 

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH and DAVID LEONHARDT; Eric Dash reported from Memphis for this article and David Leonhardt from New York.

DATELINE: MEMPHIS, Sept. 15 

 BODY:
Eric Summers saw thousands of high-stakes wagers come across his tables as a blackjack dealer and pit boss at Harrah's Casino in New Orleans. But after watching Hurricane Katrina ravage his city, Mr. Summers made the biggest bet of his life: he moved his wife and three children to Memphis, where he had no family, no job and no place to live. 
 ''I wasn't going back to New Orleans after I saw all that damage,'' Mr. Summers said.
Less than three weeks later, he and his wife, Tanesha, have signed a three-month lease for a two-bedroom apartment in the sprawling Watergrove Townhomes development that overlooks a pond. They have switched their cellphone numbers to the 901 Memphis area code and enrolled their children in the local elementary and middle schools. And last week, Mr. Summers found a new job: overseeing the gaming tables at Harrah's Horseshoe casino in Tunica, Miss., about an hour away. 
 ''This is home now,'' Mr. Summers said. ''It's just a shame it took a hurricane to help us move.''
 Federal officials say 400,000 to as many as a million people from the Gulf Coast region have scattered across the nation in the days after the storm, in perhaps the country's largest single migration since the Civil War. While hundreds of thousands flocked to nearby cities like Houston and Baton Rouge, La., others like the Summers family have fanned out along a crescent of cities farther from New Orleans where, as luck would have it, thousands of apartments were available.
 From San Antonio to St. Louis to Atlanta, the economies of these cities have chugged along in recent years, missing out on the booms and busts on the East and West Coasts. Yet there has long been a glut of empty apartments in these areas, as new buildings sprang up and lower interest rates made it more attractive for renters to buy homes. 
 As a result, evacuees have encountered plenty of affordable options, and local property managers have seen a small but noticeable boom. 
 ''It's been a double-edged sword,'' said Mark Fogelman, president of Fogelman Property Management, which owns more than 5,500 apartments in the Memphis area and has found units for at least 90 evacuees. ''It has definitely helped our rental market, but you hate to be a beneficiary because of someone else's misfortune.''
 Here in Memphis, the Summerses have at least two dozen new neighbors in their apartment complex alone who, like them, came searching for work, housing and, perhaps, a fresh start. Local leaders report that more than 6,000 families displaced from New Orleans and other towns along the Gulf Coast have registered with the Red Cross in Memphis. With extended hotel stays too expensive and the realization sinking in that the damage to their homes may prevent them from moving back any time soon, many are also fast becoming the city's newest renters.
 Most, of course, will ultimately leave. But the evacuees are expected to stay at least three months to a year as their homes and offices are rebuilt. Some may live here even longer once spouses find work and their children settle into new schools. 
 Before Hurricane Katrina hit, Houston and Dallas had the two highest vacancy rates in the country, according to Marcus & Millichap Real Estate Investment Brokerage Company, in Encino, Calif. More than 10 percent of apartments were empty in both cities. Memphis and Atlanta were not far behind. 
 Nationally, the average vacancy rate is 6.5 percent.
 Both Atlanta and Dallas have lost thousands of technology jobs, noted Hessam Nadji, a managing director at Marcus & Millichap. Houston suffered from Enron's meltdown. Memphis, one of the nation's biggest distribution centers and the headquarters of FedEx, and St. Louis have tepid economies that have been creating jobs at a slower rate than the rest of the country.
 The slow job growth meant that relatively few people were moving to the region, while some of the people already there decided to live with their parents or another relative for longer than planned.
 Memphis, Dallas and Houston were among the few big metropolitan areas in the country where rents were continuing to fall in the first half of 2005, according to Global Real Analytics, a San Francisco research company that publishes the National Real Estate Index. Landlords were often forced to offer a month or two of free rent during the first year of a lease.
 Office space was also sitting empty. Before the storm, nearly one in four square feet of office space in Dallas was vacant, according to Marcus & Millichap.
 But the movement of families and businesses in the wake of the storm appears to have given an immediate boost to some of those real estate markets. ''Pre-Katrina, the apartment market was still fairly soft,'' Daniel O'Connor, a managing director at Global Real Analytics, said. ''Now it's beginning to look more like a Northeast or Midwest rental market.''
 That is certainly true here in Memphis, although property managers said the occupancy rate among the area's roughly 75,000 apartments had slowly ticked upward since late last year. The unintended consequences of Katrina have only solidified that rebound. Except in a few hardship cases, even the special concessions many landlords have offered hurricane evacuees appear to be less generous than the companies have offered renters in the past.
 Last year, it was common to see landlords offering a $2,000 annual discount on a luxury apartment or a month's free rent. This year, some are willing to waive the application fees for new tenants, effectively shaving off a few hundred dollars. 
 Others have offered Katrina victims shorter-term lease options, like three- or six-month contracts, without charging hefty premiums. They have also eliminated requirements to verify employment -- a potentially troublesome decision if it turns out that the new tenants fall behind on their payments. No landlord wants the public relations black-eye of evicting an evacuee. 
 To be sure, the Memphis rental market has not experienced the population explosions of Baton Rouge and Houston, which have taken in tens of thousands of Gulf Coast evacuees in the last few weeks. There, it seems, landlords are leasing every square inch of usable space and commanding higher prices. 
 Nor has Memphis benefited to the same degree as Jacksonville, Fla., where a host of New Orleans businesses, from large public companies like Entergy to small law and accounting firms, have announced temporary relocations. Their workers now need temporary homes as well. 
 ''We are just not seeing the doors kicked down by Katrina folks,'' said Tom Grimes, vice president for property management at Mid-America Apartment Communities, which manages about 4,400 apartments in the Memphis area.
 Of course, Memphis landlords stand to benefit from just a few hundred new tenants, even if the gains are largely fleeting. For one, it allows them to fill apartments that would otherwise sit empty. Moreover, those who wound up in Memphis were more likely to be middle-class people who can pay the full rent. Unlike many of the new people in Houston, who arrived on government buses, most of the Memphis evacuees arrived in their own cars. 
 Take, for instance, Wilfred M. Kullman, a 69-year-old personal investment manager from New Orleans who fled the day before Katrina arrived. He came with his wife, oldest son and three pets: a parrot, a cockatoo and a cat. Because the closest hotel accepting animals was eight hours north on Interstate 55, the Sleep Inn in Memphis is where they ended up. 
 Mr. Kullman's home offCanal Street was largely unscathed in the storm, but the area around it was flooded. Now, he is leasing two, $2,000-a-month luxury apartments for his family while his neighborhood is pumped dry. ''I think I will be here at least three months, or until my office reopens,'' he said. ''But there is no way of really knowing.''

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Friday about evacuees from the Gulf Coast region who are renting apartments in cities like Memphis referred incompletely to the financial arrangements of Eric and Tanesha Summers. Their landlord, in Memphis, has waived their rent and utility bills for six months. 
 The article misstated the name of the Summerses' landlord and misidentified the site of the temporary command center for the power company, Entergy. The landlord is the Fogelman Management Group, not Fogelman Property Management. The power company headquarters is in Jackson, Miss., not Jacksonville, Fla.
 The article also referred imprecisely to the cost of two apartments being rented by another displaced family. The $2,000 in monthly payments that Wilfred M. Kullman is making for each apartment covers both rent and furniture, not just the rent.

HEADLINE: The Malibu of the North

BYLINE: By DENNY LEE

 BODY:
HERE is another reason to blame Canada. For years, movie studios have been flocking to Toronto and Montreal to make films on the cheap. But now Hollywood is outsourcing another resource to the land of maple leaves and moose: celebrity second homes. 
 Just two hours north of Toronto, Muskoka is a region of lakes and jutting granite cliffs that recalls the breathtaking vistas of the Adirondacks. More recently, however, it has begun to feel more like Malibu, as film stars and the very rich erect trophy homes along its pristine shoreline.
Never heard of Muskoka? You're not the only one. Scott Wittman, the lyricist for the Broadway musical ''Hairspray,'' hadn't either, until the comedian Martin Short invited him up this summer. ''It's a little bit of Hollywood up here,'' said Mr. Wittman, a Manhattan resident, who spent a month writing and swimming at Mr. Short's cottage on Lake Rosseau. ''It's like Golden Pond. You almost expect Katharine Hepburn to come around the corner at any moment.'' 
 Or at least Goldie Hawn, Kurt Russell, Tom Hanks or Steven Spielberg -- all either own cottages in Muskoka or visit often. 
 The celebrity appeal is not hard to appreciate. Encompassing an area about the size of Rhode Island, Muskoka is clustered around three big lakes -- Muskoka, Joseph and Rosseau -- that are carved into the Canadian Shield and framed by a dense canopy of hemlocks, pines and maples. With a galaxy of private islands and thousands of miles of glacial shoreline, Muskoka is ''beautiful and secluded, with palatial homes for the Canadian superwealthy that fit the Hollywood model elegantly,'' said Noah Cowan, co-director of the Toronto International Film Festival, which ends tomorrow. ''People come to the festival, then hang out in Muskoka.'' 
 Hockey players (this is Canada, after all) huddle here. ''Every single member of the Toronto Maple Leafs has a place in Muskoka,'' Stephen Levine, 45, a Toronto accountant who owns a cottage in the area, said with slight exaggeration.
 And if this were an episode of MTV's ''Cribs,'' the vehicle segment would not focus on Bentleys but on torpedo-shaped speedboats, mahogany racers and G.P.S.-guided seaplanes. ''You don't see sailboats or canoes anymore,'' said Bob Topp, 71, a fourth-generation Muskokan who lives in Toronto. ''The new people are anxious to show off their wealth.'' 
 But not all the money is new. Captains of Canadian industry like the Labatts, Bronfmans and Eatons have spent summers here since the beginning of the 20th century. They were joined by Pittsburgh barons like Mellon and Carnegie, who built huge houses along a narrow channel on Lake Muskoka known as Millionaires Row. 
 The rest of Ontario's cottage country, however, remained middle-class. Torontonians of more modest means could afford a cabin on the lake. ''Blue-collar guys could put away some money and buy a small place,'' said Steven Curry, a broker at ReMax Muskoka Realty. 
 But in the last decade, a new generation of millionaires arrived, buoyed by a hot Toronto economy, a real estate boom and Muskoka's newfound cachet as a retreat for the rich and famous. Small cottages were snapped up, torn down and replaced with oversize facsimiles. 
 ''We couldn't afford our cottage anymore,'' said Pat Sinclair, 65, a retired nurse from Toronto, who sold her place last year after the property taxes rose to about $9,500 from about $2,500 in 1990. ''Everything now is high-end, high-end, high-end.'' 
 For anyone casually acquainted with Muskoka, what passes for a cottage these days may come as quite a shock. Take the home of Kevin and Linda O'Leary, a couple from Boston who built a cottage on Lake Joseph five years ago. Now, rising like a wedding cake from the lakeshore, is a periwinkle-blue structure with white trim, wraparound cedar decks, three boat slips and a second-floor sun deck that is larger than some marinas here. 
 And that is just the boathouse.
 Behind it, perched on a huge slab of pink-and-gray granite, is the 9,000-square-foot main house with seven bedrooms, four stone fireplaces, a wine cellar carved into the native rock and a lofty sweep of terraces. 
 ''This is a very typical room in Muskoka,'' Ms. O'Leary, 41, said during a tour of her cottage earlier this month. The room had 30-foot cathedral ceilings and a wet bar. In a restaurant-grade kitchen, a staff of three was preparing sweetbreads and lobster for 17 people, including colleagues from her husband's former software company. ''I wanted this to have a country cottage feel,'' she said. 
 No amount of weathered shingles or barn wood flooring however, can obscure the fact that the age of McCottages has arrived in Muskoka. ''Everyone wants the Olde Muskoka look,'' said Jeff Buddo, a real estate agent from Chestnut Park Real Estate. ''When people say they have a 'cottage' these days, what they really mean is 'mansion.'''
 There is little confusion, however, when it comes to price. In 1993, the average price of a house on the three lakes was about $225,000, according to the Muskoka & Halliburton Association of Realtors. That figure is now nearing $1 million, with some prices exceeding $4 million.
 ''All of Muskoka has become a Millionaires Row,'' said Anita Latner, a real estate broker. ''Muskoka is to Toronto what the Hamptons are to New York.'' 
 Except that in Muskoka, everyone is on sparkling blue lakes and the curb appeal is from a boat. On a windy Friday afternoon, James Crowe, 40, an heir to a tire manufacturing fortune, offered a real estate cruise aboard his 27-foot-long Sea Ray runabout. ''See that boathouse?'' Mr. Crowe said, pointing to a typical structure in the distance. As he got closer, the contours of a large green house came into view. ''It's owned by some American worth $700 million, and nobody here knows or cares.'' 
 As he sped north, the cottages grew larger, the buffer between boathouses farther and the names more familiar. There were Kenny G's log cabin-style villa, on a private island, that Cindy Crawford rented this summer; the sprawling compound of Ted Rogers of Rogers Communications; the cliff-top cottage of Robert Lantos of Alliance Atlantis, the Canadian entertainment conglomerate; and the relatively modest getaway of Eric Lindros, the hockey star. 
 ''Here, at the top of Lake Joseph, it's called Billionaires Row,'' Mr. Crowe said. 
 THAT'S not to suggest that Lake Rosseau, its sister lake, is shabby, especially when the neighbors include Goldie, Kurt and Martin. The less known announce their presence through architecture: The six-slip boathouse for a private regatta of antique racers and fishing boats. The two-island estate linked by a footbridge flanked by twin turrets -- one with a hot tub, the other with a sauna. The water slide that is chiseled into the sloping granite. 
 ''My 3-and-a-half-year-old son lives on the waterslide,'' said Bobby Genovese, 41, who divides his time between a place in the Bahamas and 10 other homes. His Muskoka cottage, built three years ago at the cost of about $7.5 million, might be his favorite. ''Where else can you get to three of Canada's best golf courses by boat?'' 
 That's assuming, of course, you're a member. There are now about two dozen golf courses and counting in Muskoka, including six that are private. The newest, Oviinbyrd, tries to be so exclusive that its phone number is unlisted and the entrance is unmarked. Membership, roughly $85,000, is limited to friends of the owner, Peter Schwartz, a dot-com alumnus.
 ''It doesn't matter how much money you have or how famous you are -- it's about who you know,'' explained Dave Gardiner, Oviinbyrd's general manager. ''Martin Short's wife came to play the other day, but she couldn't because she wasn't a member.''
 The one sport that everyone seems to share is celebrity-spotting.
 ''I won't drop names, but we get a fair amount of the movie set, like Kurt Russell, Tom Hanks and Bill Murray,'' said E.J. Gordon, who has a no-autographs policy at his restaurants in Port Carling, where the three lakes meet.
 ''Steven Spielberg was here a couple of weeks ago,'' said a worker at the Muskoka Airport, where the Gulfstreams are parked like taxis.
 ''Kate Hudson drops by,'' said Ronald Brabander, who runs Blondie's Restaurant in Gravenhurst on Lake Muskoka. 
 The air of celebrity is so thick that the novelty may be wearing thin. ''I've seen them at the grocery store, I've seen them at the marina, I've seen them playing golf,'' said Bob Schultz, a Toronto investor who has been coming to Muskoka for 35 years. ''Nobody pays attention to them anymore.''

HEADLINE: Not The New Deal

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN. 
E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Now it begins: America's biggest relief and recovery program since the New Deal. And the omens aren't good. 
 It's a given that the Bush administration, which tried to turn Iraq into a laboratory for conservative economic policies, will try the same thing on the Gulf Coast. The Heritage Foundation, which has surely been helping Karl Rove develop the administration's recovery plan, has already published a manifesto on post-Katrina policy. It calls for waivers on environmental rules, the elimination of capital gains taxes and the private ownership of public school buildings in the disaster areas. And if any of the people killed by Katrina, most of them poor, had a net worth of more than $1.5 million, Heritage wants to exempt their heirs from the estate tax. 
Still, even conservatives admit that deregulation, tax cuts and privatization won't be enough. Recovery will require a lot of federal spending. And aside from the effect on the deficit -- we're about to see the spectacle of tax cuts in the face of both a war and a huge reconstruction effort -- this raises another question: how can discretionary government spending take place on that scale without creating equally large-scale corruption?
 It's possible to spend large sums honestly, as Franklin D. Roosevelt demonstrated in the 1930's. F.D.R. presided over a huge expansion of federal spending, including a lot of discretionary spending by the Works Progress Administration. Yet the image of public relief, widely regarded as corrupt before the New Deal, actually improved markedly. 
 How did that happen? The answer is that the New Deal made almost a fetish out of policing its own programs against potential corruption. In particular, F.D.R. created a powerful ''division of progress investigation'' to look into complaints of malfeasance in the W.P.A. That division proved so effective that a later Congressional investigation couldn't find a single serious irregularity it had missed.
 This commitment to honest government wasn't a sign of Roosevelt's personal virtue; it reflected a political imperative. F.D.R.'s mission in office was to show that government activism works. To maintain that mission's credibility, he needed to keep his administration's record clean.
 But George W. Bush isn't F.D.R. Indeed, in crucial respects he's the anti-F.D.R.
 President Bush subscribes to a political philosophy that opposes government activism -- that's why he has tried to downsize and privatize programs wherever he can. (He still hopes to privatize Social Security, F.D.R.'s biggest legacy.) So even his policy failures don't bother his strongest supporters: many conservatives view the inept response to Katrina as a vindication of their lack of faith in government, rather than as a reason to reconsider their faith in Mr. Bush.
 And to date the Bush administration, which has no stake in showing that good government is possible, has been averse to investigating itself. On the contrary, it has consistently stonewalled corruption investigations and punished its own investigators if they try to do their jobs. 
 That's why Mr. Bush's promise last night that he will have ''a team of inspectors general reviewing all expenditures'' rings hollow. Whoever these inspectors general are, they'll be mindful of the fate of Bunnatine Greenhouse, a highly regarded auditor at the Army Corps of Engineers who suddenly got poor performance reviews after she raised questions about Halliburton's contracts in Iraq. She was demoted late last month.
 Turning the funds over to state and local governments isn't the answer, either. F.D.R. actually made a point of taking control away from local politicians; then as now, patronage played a big role in local politics.
 And our sympathy for the people of Mississippi and Louisiana shouldn't blind us to the realities of their states' political cultures. Last year the newsletter Corporate Crime Reporter ranked the states according to the number of federal public-corruption convictions per capita. Mississippi came in first, and Louisiana came in third.
 Is there any way Mr. Bush could ensure an honest recovery program? Yes -- he could insulate decisions about reconstruction spending from politics by placing them in the hands of an autonomous agency headed by a political independent, or, if no such person can be found, a Democrat (as a sign of good faith). 
 He didn't do that last night, and probably won't. There's every reason to believe the reconstruction of the Gulf Coast, like the failed reconstruction of Iraq, will be deeply marred by cronyism and corruption.

HEADLINE: Bush Pledges Federal Role in Rebuilding Gulf Coast

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER; Anne E. Kornblut, Robert Pear and David E. Sanger contributed reporting from Washington for this article.

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Sept. 15 

 BODY:
President Bush called Thursday night for the rebuilding of the devastated Gulf Coast through the creation of a Gulf Opportunity Zone, a government enterprise that he said would provide help on taxes, housing, education and job training for the victims of Hurricane Katrina.
 ''The work that has begun in the Gulf Coast region will be one of the largest reconstruction efforts the world has ever seen,'' Mr. Bush said in remarks delivered in Jackson Square against the brightly lighted backdrop of St. Louis Cathedral, a symbol of the heart and soul of New Orleans for almost three centuries.
Mr. Bush delivered his speech, carried live by the major television networks, in the middle of the city's darkened French Quarter, where Army troops from the 82nd Airborne Division were on patrol. The Bush White House, well practiced in the art of presidential stagecraft, provided its own generators for the lighting and communications equipment that beamed Mr. Bush's remarks to the nation. 
 ''And tonight I also offer this pledge of the American people: Throughout the area hit by the hurricane, we will do what it takes, we will stay as long as it takes to help citizens rebuild their communities and their lives,'' Mr. Bush said.
 The mayor of New Orleans announced Thursday that residents and business owners could return to some parts of the city during daylight. [Page A18.]
 Mr. Bush ordered an immediate review of emergency plans for all cities, and said there was a need for greater federal authority and a broader role for armed forces in certain emergencies. He called for a federal government assessment of his administration's response to the storm and said that he would work with both parties in Congress in an investigation of what went wrong. 
 ''This government will learn the lessons of Hurricane Katrina,'' Mr. Bush said.
 The president did not, however, embrace calls for an independent commission to investigate the disaster. 
 White House officials viewed the speech as the culmination of a pivotal week in which Mr. Bush tried to turn around his image as a chief executive slow to respond to the greatest natural disaster in American history. The speech was meant to portray Mr. Bush as a forceful leader in control of the crisis and sympathetic to the people in the region.
 ''Tonight, so many victims of the hurricane and flood are far from home and friends and familiar things,'' Mr. Bush said. ''You need to know that our whole nation cares about you, and in the journey ahead you are not alone. To all who carry a burden, I extend the deepest sympathy of our country.''
 Mr. Bush, dressed uncharacteristically in shirt-sleeves for a formal national address, said that the Gulf Opportunity Zone, encompassing Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, would provide tax incentives and loans for small businesses, including, he pointed out, minority-owned enterprises. Mr. Bush also said the federal government would provide evacuees with accounts of up to $5,000 that they could use for job training and education.
 In addition, he asked Congress to pass what he called an Urban Homesteading Act, which would provide building sites on federal land through a lottery to low-income citizens, free of charge. In return, Mr. Bush said, residents would promise to build on the lots, with either a mortgage or help from a charitable organization like Habitat for Humanity.
 Mr. Bush spoke after he was driven through empty, pitch-black streets, where members of the 82nd Airborne stood on corners in the darkness saluting the motorcade.
 ''I am speaking to you from the city of New Orleans, nearly empty, still partly under water and waiting for life and hope to return,'' Mr. Bush said from a lectern set up in the grass and hidden behind camouflage netting in Jackson Square. 
 In the aftermath of the storm, Mr. Bush said, ''we have seen fellow citizens left stunned and uprooted searching for loved ones, and grieving for the dead and looking for meaning in a tragedy that seems so blind and random.''
 In his fourth trip to the region since the storm, Mr. Bush directly addressed the suffering of the largely poor, black evacuees at the New Orleans Superdome and convention center: ''We have also witnessed the kind of desperation no citizen of this great and generous nation should ever have to know -- fellow Americans calling out for food and water, vulnerable people left at the mercy of criminals who had no mercy and the bodies of the dead lying uncovered and untended in the street.''
 The president said state and local officials would have the primary role in planning for reconstruction, and in changing zoning laws and building codes. He listed many of the relief efforts now under way, including the registration of evacuees and retraining for workers.
 Mr. Bush also tackled the tough issues of race and poverty that have been the source of enormous criticism and caused even Republicans to question the administration's commitment: ''As all of us saw on television, there is also some deep, persistent poverty in this region as well. And that poverty has roots in a history of racial discrimination, which cut off generations from the opportunity of America. We have a duty to confront this poverty with bold action. So let us restore all that we have cherished from yesterday, and let us rise above the legacy of inequality.''
 Mr. Bush did not offer cost estimates for his proposals on Thursday night, but they were drawn from the kind of experiments -- with ''opportunity zones'' and tax incentives -- that Republicans have greatly preferred to huge federal spending efforts. The president seemed to try to balance a comprehensive government plan with an assurance that Washington would back away and allow Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama -- and the city of New Orleans -- to decide how to rebuild. 
 ''That is our vision of the future, in this city and beyond: We will not just rebuild, we will build higher and better,'' he promised. 
 Aside from the opportunity zone, Mr. Bush also proposed ''worker recovery accounts'' of up to $5,000 that evacuees could use for job training and education. The proposal sounds much like the kinds of accounts set up after the passage of the North America Free Trade Agreement in the early 1990's to help retrain workers displaced by foreign competition, a program that met with mixed reviews.
 But in his speech, Mr. Bush also left some of the most controversial ideas unmentioned. His words seemed to imply that New Orleans neighborhoods would be rebuilt on the same sites that were flooded, rather than letting that land return to its original state, as wetlands that could provide a relief valve in the case of a future flood. Many of the most vulnerable neighborhoods were largely occupied by the city's poorest, and relocating those neighborhoods opened issues that one White House official said today ''are not for us to deal with.''
 ''Protecting a city that sits lower than the water around it is not easy,'' Mr. Bush said, ''but it can and has been done.''
 He added: ''And all who question the future of the Crescent City need to know: There is no way to imagine America without New Orleans, and this great city will rise again.''
 The federal government, Mr. Bush said, will undertake a ''close partnership'' with Mississippi and Louisiana, with New Orleans and other Gulf Coast cities so they can rebuild in a ''sensible, well-planned way.'' He said the federal government will cover the majority of the costs of rebuilding the infrastructure in the disaster zone, from roads and bridges to schools and water systems.
 The president said he expected the work to be done quickly, and that taxpayers would expect it to be performed ''honestly and wisely.'' He promised to have a team of inspectors reviewing all expenditures.
 But many Republicans predicted that the costs could run as high or higher than the war in Iraq, up to $200 billion, and noted that the White House had said $51.8 billion in emergency federal funds just approved by Congress, on top of an earlier $10 billion, would last for just a few weeks. Mr. Bush did not name a lead rebuilding official in the speech, as some White House officials are urging, and Scott McClellan, the White House press secretary, did not rule out the naming of such an official at a later date. Gen. Tommy Franks, who commanded forces in Afghanistan and Iraq, and John F. Welch Jr., the former chief executive of General Electric, are names often mentioned by Republicans as possibilities.
 The president's proposal for an opportunity zone draws on more than a decade of federal experience with offering tax credits and other incentives for investment in economically depressed areas.
 In 2002, the Bush administration selected New Orleans as a renewal community, eligible to share in billions of dollars worth of federal tax incentives intended to stimulate job growth and economic development. Last October, Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco of Louisiana said the program had helped create jobs and must expand across the Delta.
 Mr. Bush's proposal goes further. He would provide tax breaks, loans and loan guarantees to encourage businesses to invest in areas hit by the hurricane.
 The Government Accountability Office, an investigative arm of Congress, said last year that federal agencies did not collect the data needed to assess the existing program or to show how the tax benefits had been used.
 The president's comments were met with praise from local officials, including Ms. Blanco, who along with other local officials listened to Mr. Bush's speech from a bench in Jackson Square. 
 ''Louisiana's people are strong, optimistic and determined to rebuild this great region, but we cannot do it without the resources of our nation and our government,'' she said. ''I take the president at his word when he says those resources will be there when we need them.''

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Split Over Big Plans for Storm Spending

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 15 

 BODY:
The drive to pour tens of billions of federal dollars into rebuilding the hurricane-battered Gulf Coast is widening a fissure among Republicans over fiscal policy, with more of them expressing worry about unbridled spending.
 On Thursday, even before President Bush promised that ''federal funds will cover the great majority of the costs of repairing public infrastructure in the disaster zone,'' fiscal conservatives from the House and Senate joined budget watchdog groups in demanding that the administration be judicious in asking for taxpayer dollars.
One fiscal conservative, Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, said Thursday, ''I don't believe that everything that should happen in Louisiana should be paid for by the rest of the country. I believe there are certain responsibilities that are due the people of Louisiana.'' 
 Senator Jim DeMint, Republican of South Carolina, called for restoring ''sanity'' to the federal recovery effort. Congress has approved $62 billion, mostly to cover costs already incurred, and the price tag is rising. The House and Senate approved tax relief Thursday at an estimated cost of more than $5 billion on top of $3.5 billion in housing vouchers approved by the Senate on Wednesday. 
 ''We know we need to help, but throwing more and more money without accountability at this is not going to solve the problem,'' Mr. DeMint said.
 Their comments were in marked contrast to the sweeping administration approach outlined by Mr. Bush in his speech from New Orleans and a call by Senate Republican leaders for a rebuilding effort similar to the Marshall Plan after World War II. Congressional Democrats advocated their own comprehensive recovery program Thursday, promoting a combination of rebuilding programs coupled with housing, health care, agriculture and education initiatives. The president also emphasized the importance of private entrepreneurship to create jobs ''and help break the cycle of poverty.''
 Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, said he believed that providing rapid and extensive help overrode the need to cut spending elsewhere. ''I think we have to understand that we have a devastation that has to be taken care of,'' Mr. Reid said. ''And I'm not into finding where we can cut yet.''
 That mindset is troubling to other lawmakers who fear that in addition to a reborn Gulf Coast, something else will rise from the storm: record federal deficits. 
 ''We know this is a huge bill,'' said Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. ''We don't want to lay it on future generations.'' Given the fierce political backlash to the stumbling relief effort in the days after the hurricane struck, House Republican leaders have been reluctant to stand in the way of any emergency legislation. After the speech, Speaker J. Dennis Hastert acknowledged that the price tag means that ''for every dollar we spend on this, it is going to take a little bit longer to balance the budget.'' He said he was willing to listen to ideas to pay for the aid, but, ''Quite frankly, we have to get this job done.''
 Despite those comments, many Republicans are increasingly edgy about the White House's push for a potentially open-ended recovery budget, worried that the president -- in trying to regroup politically -- was making expensive promises they would have to keep. 
 ''We are not sure he knows what he is getting into,'' said one senior House Republican official who requested anonymity because of the potential consequences of publicly criticizing the administration.
 The fears about the costs of the storm are building on widespread dissatisfaction among conservatives about spending in recent years by the Republican-controlled Congress. That unrest was already high after Congressional approval of a transportation measure that critics denounced as bloated with marginal home-state projects. 
 That sore spot was rubbed raw earlier this week when Representative Tom DeLay, the House majority leader, suggested that the Republican Congress had already trimmed much of the fat from the federal budget, making it difficult to find ways to offset hurricane spending. 
 Mr. Coburn called such a claim ludicrous and other Republicans took exception as well. 
 ''There has never been a time where there is more total spending and more wasteful spending in Washington than we have today,'' said Pat Toomey, a former Republican congressman from Pennsylvania and the head of the conservative Club for Growth. ''There is ample opportunity to find the offsets we need so that this does not have to be a fiscal disaster as well as a natural disaster.''
 On another front, Republicans and Democrats continued their dispute over how to investigate government failures in the storm response. The House approved a select committee to oversee the inquiry despite Democratic objections that only a special commission outside of Congress could do a credible job.
 The House voted 224 to 188 to establish a 20-member panel to work in concert with a similar Senate panel in studying the adequacy of local, state and federal preparations for the storm and why the relief effort was so troubled, stranding thousands in chaotic conditions without sufficient food, water or medical care.
 Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, said the special committee was an effort to ''whitewash'' the inquiry though she later said she would not stand in the way if Democrats want to sit on the panel. In another effort to reduce Democratic opposition, Mr. Hastert on Thursday named Representative Thomas M. Davis III, a sometimes Republican maverick from Virginia, to lead the panel.
 As for paying for the recovery, Ms. Pelosi raised the possibility of 50-year bonds tied to the reconstruction.
 The conservative Republicans worried about the outlays said the president and Congressional leaders need to ask the public to share in the sacrifice and suggested savings could be easily wrung from federal agencies or in Congress in ways like eliminating pet projects.
 ''Katrina breaks my heart,'' said Representative Mike Pence, Republican of Indiana and chairman of a caucus of more than 100 House Republicans who advocate conservative spending policy. ''Congress must do everything the American people expect us to do to meet the needs of families and communities affected by Katrina. But we must not let Katrina break the bank for our children and grandchildren.''

HEADLINE: Forget the U.N.: Clinton Has a League of His Own

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
Bill Clinton -- former president, heart patient and fund-raiser for tsunami and hurricane victims -- has a quartet of new causes.
 And with more than 150 leaders in New York City for the 60th anniversary of the United Nations, he could not resist talking about them yesterday at what amounted to his own shadow summit meeting.
So there he was, on a hotel ballroom stage that had been made over to look something like the set of a daytime talk show, with deep-cushioned chairs that he and his guests -- Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and King Abdullah II of Jordan -- could sink into. As the host, Mr. Clinton concentrated on the four topics of the Clinton Global Initiative, as the conference was called: poverty, religious conflict, climate change and governing. 
 Among other things, Ms. Rice, Mr. Blair and Mr. Clinton urged investment in Gaza. ''There is a lot of poverty and despair'' in Gaza, Ms. Rice said, but also ''new hope and opportunities because of the Israeli withdrawal.'' King Abdullah called Gaza's economy ''a major challenge.''
 But Mr. Clinton and his aides said the conference at the Sheraton New York Hotel and Towers was about more than discussions of ''pro-poor investment strategies'' and interfaith partnerships. The corporate executives and leaders of nonprofit groups who had been invited to attend were also invited to make specific commitments. 
 Mr. Clinton and his aides said that more than 50 commitments totaling $300 million had already been made, including a $100 million investment fund for businesses in Africa, and that they expected more by the time the three-day session ended tomorrow with speeches by Secretary General Kofi Annan of the United Nations and Mr. Clinton. Aides to the former president said that Mr. Clinton and his staff would keep in touch with the pledge-makers to see that the commitments were carried out.
 Echoing that idea, Mr. Clinton said the conference was ''more than a photo opportunity, more than business as usual.'' 
 ''All of us come to meetings, we study issues, we say what we think and too often we complain when the governments that we seek to influence ignore what we think is our sound advice,'' Mr. Clinton said. The conference provided a platform for what he called an explosion of nongovernmental organizations and individuals trying to solve problems across national borders.
 Some of those in the audience worked in the Clinton administration, among them Richard C. Holbrooke, a former ambassador to the United Nations, and George Stephanopoulos, a former adviser who is now host of the ABC News program ''This Week.'' 
 The Rev. Jesse L. Jackson also attended the ballroom session. But not everyone on the conference schedule has Clinton connections. Besides Ms. Rice, the conference schedule says that Paul Wolfowitz, the World Bank president and the former deputy secretary of defense, will be on hand.
 For many of those attending the conference, yesterday began with a wait in a long line. Everyone had to be photographed for the laminated passes needed to get into the sessions during the day. Many of those who registered also received a white canvas bag stuffed with more than just a ballpoint pen and a notepad. Among other items, it contained compact discs, including one by Mario Frangoulis, and a Nokia cellphone.
 ''Isn't this awesome?'' said Ryan Carlson, the director of the Foundation for Reconciliation in the Middle East, a London-based group that, among other things, has supplied generators to a church in Baghdad. Pulling the cellphone out of its box, he said, ''They haven't even marketed this in the states.''
 Others in the line commended Mr. Clinton for spearheading such a gathering. ''I think this is what he's best suited to do,'' said Richard Blackledge, the director of communications for Biodiesel America, which promotes using fuel made from vegetable oil. ''Focusing on peace and the environment makes sense. How hot is it in New York in September? And Katrina? The Gulf Stream is slowing down, the glaciers are melting and it's time for everyone to wise up.'' 
 He said Biodiesel America had begun a school bus ''initiative'' -- at a conference with the word initiative in its title, perhaps it was inevitable that that word would pop up often during the day -- that would reduce carbon emissions from the nation's 390,000 diesel school buses. ''The schoolchildren in American spend an hour and a half on buses every day, and more and more of them have asthma,'' he said. ''We're basically poisoning the kids along the way.''
 After the day's workshops -- and the ballroom session -- the people attending the conference went to a reception at the Museum of Modern Art. Also on the schedule was an 11 p.m. reception for reporters covering the conference -- no cameras allowed, the schedule said -- at Nobu, on West 57th Street. There was no media advisory cautioning reporters not to stay out too late. The next event on the schedule was an 8 a.m. panel discussion.

HEADLINE: City Unemployment at Lowest Level in 17 Years

BYLINE: By MICHELLE O'DONNELL

 BODY:
New York City's unemployment rate continued to decline last month, dropping to 5.1 percent, its lowest level in 17 years, according to data released yesterday by the State Department of Labor.
 The decline, which also represents a decrease from the city's July unemployment rate of 5.7 percent, was the latest evidence of a steady drop in unemployment since August 2004, when the city's rate was 6.8 percent, the state data shows.
The city's decline matches a drop at the state and federal levels, the Department of Labor said. The state's unemployment rate dropped to 4.7 percent last month from 5.6 percent in August 2004, while nationally, the jobless rate declined to 4.9 percent from 5.4 percent in that same period. 
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg applauded the decline, crediting his administration's policies for creating jobs that have provided employment to 51,400 more New Yorkers since August 2004. ''By improving our quality of life, driving down crime, attracting private investment and replacing outdated zoning laws, we are continuing to build a city of opportunity for all New Yorkers,'' Mr. Bloomberg said in a statement.
 Taking an opposing view, Mr. Bloomberg's likely Democratic challenger, Fernando Ferrer, has frequently cautioned during his campaign for the Democratic nomination for mayor that unemployment remains disproportionately higher among the city's minority groups, especially African-American and Hispanic men. 
 Borough by borough, Manhattan posted the lowest unemployment rate -- 4.4. percent -- last month, the state figures show, while the Bronx had the highest, 6.7 percent. But of the five boroughs, the Bronx recorded the largest decline in unemployment over the last year, dropping by 1.9 percentage points from 8.6 percent. 
 Brooklyn recorded the second highest decline, to 5.6 percent last month from 7.4 percent in August 2004. Staten Island reported a drop of 1.6 percentage points, to 4.6 percent last month from 6.5 percent a year earlier.
 Queens dropped to 4.6 percent last month, from 6 percent in August 2004. None of the borough rates were seasonally adjusted.

HEADLINE: United Democratic Party Challenges the Mayor

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL and JIM RUTENBERG

 BODY:
Showing a post-primary unity that had eluded the Democratic Party in New York City for more than a decade, the losing mayoral candidates took to the steps of City Hall yesterday to throw their support behind Fernando Ferrer. The Democrats portrayed Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg as a true Republican presiding over a city that caters to the wealthy as the middle class and the poor increasingly struggle to get by.
 Surrounded by hundreds of Democratic officials, Anthony D. Weiner, C. Virginia Fields, Gifford Miller and Mr. Ferrer heaped praise upon one another while excoriating Mr. Bloomberg, effectively jump-starting the general election campaign by offering a view of the city starkly at odds with Mr. Bloomberg's rosier picture.
''We can do better than a mayor who says he doesn't think many people make the minimum wage. We can do better than a mayor who says that poor people get better health care in this city than the wealthy,'' Mr. Ferrer said before a cheering crowd wilting under a hot sun. ''I believe that hope and opportunity have to be present in equal measure on every block, on every street in every neighborhood in every borough of our city.'' 
 The rally crystallized what is emerging as the dominant theme of the mayoral race, a battle over perceptions of life in New York: one of a city on the move for all its residents with a rebounding economy, improving schools and lower crime, as the Bloomberg campaign suggests; the other of a city Mr. Ferrer sees, in which the poor are being left behind, the middle class is being squeezed and too many children are dropping out of school into a dire future.
 For Mr. Bloomberg's camp, the show of party unity was a worrisome development, and the Bloomberg campaign began a counteroffensive yesterday by displaying support for the mayor among black leaders in the form of an endorsement by the Rev. Calvin O. Butts 3rd, the pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church, the most politically influential church in Harlem. Mr. Butts had supported the mayoral candidacy of Ms. Fields, and his endorsement signaled how the Bloomberg campaign is working to peel away black voters and leaders disdainful of Mr. Ferrer.
 ''The mayor is a strong mayor and it does not make sense for the city of New York to make a change now,'' Mr. Butts said in endorsing Mr. Bloomberg yesterday morning at the International House of Pancakes in Harlem. ''We are moving in the right direction.'' 
 Mr. Bloomberg is planning a foray onto Mr. Ferrer's home turf today by releasing a new Spanish-language television ad featuring the singer Willie Colon.
 Mr. Ferrer has been hard at work personally reaching out to Democrats who supported other candidates, asking or thanking them for their support, they say, and his campaign has been lining up endorsements and fund-raising help from luminaries of the national party. And other top Democrats are waiting in the wings to endorse him: backing from Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton is expected today. 
 The gathering at City Hall yesterday was a rare display of unity for a party that has found itself fractured after nearly every mayoral primary since 1989. This time, it was Mr. Weiner's decision not to participate in a potential runoff that paved the way for party leaders and elected officials to line up behind Mr. Ferrer, the former Bronx borough president.
 But for all the show of togetherness, serious questions remain about how fiercely Democrats will work for Mr. Ferrer's candidacy, especially in terms of pushing their supporters toward him in neighborhoods where he is weak. Mr. Bloomberg has collected the endorsements of regular pillars of the party, from several high-profile national Democratic donors to the construction, municipal and hotel workers' unions.
 And Mr. Bloomberg's campaign appears to be angling for the endorsement of the Working Families Party, a growing left-leaning force in city and state politics, which could not agree on an endorsement before the primary election. Party leaders plan to meet late Saturday to discuss a possible endorsement. 
 Party officials said yesterday that on the day before the Democratic primary, they received a fax with a Bloomberg campaign cover sheet with the results of a poll of 251 registered Working Families Party members that showed the mayor and Mr. Ferrer in ''a statistical dead heat'' among those voters, according to a party official who had seen the results. Party leaders said the poll appeared to have been commissioned by the Bloomberg campaign; Stu Loeser, a spokesman for the campaign, said he would neither confirm nor deny the poll's existence. 
 Also helping Mr. Bloomberg, some Democrats still harbor ill will toward Mr. Ferrer because of his role in denying Mark Green the same picture of unity after the hard-fought runoff between the two in 2001, which Mr. Green won. Mr. Green said that he was not invited to the event yesterday, adding that he supports Mr. Ferrer.
 In addition, supporters at the rally said that having so much of the party leadership behind him could bring Mr. Ferrer only so far, and that he now had to work hard to change the perceived dynamic of the race: that with all major indicators in the city seemingly pointing upward, and armed as he is with a huge campaign kitty, Mr. Bloomberg is going to be next to impossible to beat. 
 Assemblyman Jose Rivera, the Bronx County Democratic leader and close Ferrer ally, acknowledged that the onus was now on Mr. Ferrer to chip away at Mr. Bloomberg's popularity, which is at record highs in polls. But Mr. Rivera said he believed the mayor's high approval ratings were the result of his multimillion-dollar barrage of advertisements promoting his record, which began running in the spring and ran through much of the summer unanswered. He said he believed Mr. Bloomberg's poll numbers would dwindle as Mr. Ferrer begins making his case more loudly.
 ''We're talking about a mayor who just a year ago everybody was booing,'' he said of Mr. Bloomberg. 
 Still, State Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, who ran in the 2001 Democratic primary, highlighted the difficulty of Mr. Ferrer's task when he said during an interview yesterday, ''Things are going well in the city, the economy is booming.''
 But he added, ''This is a huge city and where one arena of services is going well, another is failing, and there are other vulnerabilities.''
 Mr. Ferrer has struggled to define his message this year but he was already taking a pickax yesterday to the notion of Mr. Bloomberg's invincibility, accusing him of being someone ''who cannot seem to understand the struggle of New Yorkers.''
 ''This race is just beginning, and we're only going to get stronger,'' Mr. Ferrer said. ''Already we've seen a strong and growing coalition of Democrats across the city and nation.'' 
 Herman D. Farrell Jr., the state Democratic chairman, called the rally ''the worst nightmare for the present mayor.''
 Mr. Bloomberg's campaign team was not about to concede that much. But his advisers say they are girding for what they expect to be a shift in the arc of the campaign.
 As the presumed Democratic nominee, Mr. Ferrer suddenly has the media spotlight to himself, the sort of exposure that aides to both candidates agree could easily translate into higher poll ratings and, possibly, that key ingredient: momentum.
 And badly outgunned as he is by Mr. Bloomberg's billions, Mr. Ferrer is likely to have a sudden infusion of money, thanks to generous new campaign financing provisions. That will allow him to achieve at least some semblance of parity with Mr. Bloomberg on television and in mailboxes.
 For all the talk these days of a certain victory for Mr. Bloomberg, he himself has said that a sudden gaffe or a single incident out of his control could change everything. After all, he was 24 points behind Mr. Green at the start of the 2001 general election.
 Now it is Mr. Bloomberg who seems to have such a formidable lead over Mr. Ferrer, and neither side expects it to hold in the coming days and weeks. ''Those margins narrow,'' said Edward I. Koch, the former mayor. 
 A tightening in the polls that would create a certain story line that Mr. Ferrer is a man on the move. The key question, of course, is what Mr. Bloomberg will do about it. 
 His opening salvo in the general election has been far more muted than in 2001, when he came out sharply against Mr. Green as soon as Mr. Green emerged as the Democratic nominee. For the second day in a row Mr. Bloomberg stuck to promoting his record and avoiding mentioning Mr. Ferrer by name.
 Asked yesterday how he envisioned his campaign he said, ''This election is about what we've done the last four years: improving schools, bringing down crime, building affordable housing, bringing jobs here, improving our health system, we've done a lot.''
 But, in a subtle answer to charges by Mr. Ferrer that Mr. Bloomberg paints an overly rosy picture of the city, he added, ''There's more to do certainly; there's more to do in our schools, certainly there's more affordable housing we're going to need, certainly we need more jobs coming into this city.''
 Mr. Bloomberg's team has spent the last several months formulating lines of attack against Mr. Ferrer and collecting information to use against him. But with the mayor's lead in the polls still comfortable, the campaign does not seem to see a need to go on the offensive just yet -- rather, it is waiting for what it expects to be an inevitable attack by Mr. Ferrer. 
 ''From everything we can see, the campaign the Democrats are formulating is one that is going to paint a distorted and negative picture of New York City,'' said William T. Cunningham, a senior adviser to the mayor. ''We'll defend New York City, we'll defend the mayor's record.''

HEADLINE: 'This Great City Will Rise Again,' Bush Promises 

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Bush's speech last night about Hurricane Katrina, as recorded by The New York Times. A full transcript is online at nytimes.com/katrina.
 Tonight so many victims of the hurricane and the flood are far from home and friends and familiar things. You need to know that our whole nation cares about you -- and in the journey ahead you're not alone. To all who carry a burden of loss, I extend the deepest sympathy of our country. To every person who has served and sacrificed in this emergency, I offer the gratitude of our country. And tonight I also offer this pledge of the American people: Throughout the area hit by the hurricane, we will do what it takes, we will stay as long as it takes to help citizens rebuild their communities and their lives. And all who question the future of the Crescent City need to know: There is no way to imagine America without New Orleans, and this great city will rise again.
The work of rescue is largely finished; the work of recovery is moving forward. In nearly all of Mississippi, electric power has been restored. Trade is starting to return to the Port of New Orleans, and agricultural shipments are moving down the Mississippi River. All major gasoline pipelines are now in operation, preventing the supply disruptions that many feared. The breaks in the levees have been closed, the pumps are running and the water here in New Orleans is receding by the hour. Environmental officials are on the ground, taking water samples; identifying and dealing with hazardous debris and working to get drinking water and waste water treatment systems operating again. And some very sad duties are being carried out by professionals who gather the dead, treat them with respect and prepare them for their rest. 
 In the task of recovery and rebuilding, some of the hardest work is still ahead and it will require the creative skill and generosity of a united country. 
 Our first commitment is to meet the immediate needs of those who had to flee their homes and leave all their possessions behind. For these Americans, every night brings uncertainty, every day requires new courage, and in the months to come will bring more than their fair share of struggles. The Department of Homeland Security is registering evacuees who are now in shelters and churches or private homes -- whether in the gulf region or far away. I have signed an order providing immediate assistance to people from the disaster area. 
 To carry out the first stages of the relief effort and begin rebuilding at once, I have asked for, and the Congress has provided, more than $60 billion. This is an unprecedented response to an unprecedented crisis, which demonstrates the compassion and resolve of our nation.Our second commitment is to help the citizens of the Gulf Coast to overcome this disaster, put their lives back together and rebuild their communities. Along this coast, for mile after mile, the wind and water swept the land clean. In Mississippi, many thousands of houses were damaged or destroyed. In New Orleans and surrounding parishes, more than a quarter-million houses are no longer safe to live in. Hundreds of thousands of people from across this region will need to find longer-term housing. 
 Our goal is to get people out of the shelters by the middle of October. So we are providing direct assistance to evacuees that allows them to rent apartments, and many already are moving into places of their own. A number of states have taken in evacuees and shown them great compassion, admitting children to school and providing health care. So I will work with the Congress to ensure that states are reimbursed for these extra expenses. 
 In the disaster area -- and in cities that have received huge numbers of displaced people -- we're beginning to bring in mobile homes and trailers for temporary use. To relieve the burden on local health care facilities in the region, we're sending extra doctors and nurses to these areas. We're also providing money that can be used to cover overtime pay for police and fire departments while the cities and towns rebuild.
 Near New Orleans and Biloxi and other cities housing is urgently needed for police and firefighters, other service providers and the many workers who are going to rebuild these cities. Right now, many are sleeping on ships we have brought to the Port of New Orleans -- and more ships are on their way to the region. And we'll provide mobile homes and supply them with basic services, as close to the construction areas as possible, so the rebuilding process can go forward as quickly as possible. 
 Our third commitment is this: When communities are rebuilt, they must be even better and stronger than before the storm. Within the gulf region are some of the most beautiful and historic places in America. As all of us saw on television, there is also some deep, persistent poverty in this region as well. That poverty has roots in a history of racial discrimination, which cut off generations from the opportunity of America. We have a duty to confront this poverty with bold action. So let us restore all that we have cherished from yesterday and let us rise above the legacy of inequality. When the streets are rebuilt, there should be many new businesses, including minority-owned businesses, along those streets. When the houses are rebuilt, more families should own, not rent, those houses. When the regional economy revives, local people should be prepared for the jobs being created. Americans want the Gulf Coast not just to survive, but to thrive; not just to cope, but to overcome. We want evacuees to come home, for the best of reasons -- because they have a real chance at a better life in a place they love. 
 When one resident of this city who lost his home was asked by a reporter if he would relocate, he said, ''Naw, I will rebuild, but I'll build higher.'' That is our vision for the future, in this city and beyond: we'll not just rebuild, we'll build higher and better. 
 To meet this goal, I will listen to good ideas from Congress, and state and local officials, and the private sector. 
 Tonight I propose the creation of a Gulf Opportunity Zone, encompassing the region of the disaster in Louisiana and Mississippi and Alabama. Within this zone, we should provide immediate incentives for job-creating investment, tax relief for small businesses, incentives to companies that create jobs, and loans and loan guarantees for small businesses, including minority-owned enterprises, to get them up and running again. 
 I also want to know all the facts about the government response to Hurricane Katrina. The storm involved a massive flood, a major supply and security operation, and an evacuation order affecting more than a million people. It was not a normal hurricane and the normal disaster relief system was not equal to it. 
 Many of the men and women of the Coast Guard, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the United States military, the National Guard, Homeland Security and state and local governments performed skillfully under the worst conditions. 
 Yet the system, at every level of government, was not well coordinated and was overwhelmed in the first few days. It is now clear that a challenge on this scale requires greater federal authority and a broader role for the armed forces -- the institution of our government most capable of massive logistical operations on a moment's notice. 
 Four years after the frightening experience of September the 11th, Americans have every right to expect a more effective response in a time of emergency. When the federal government fails to meet such an obligation, I as president am responsible for the problem and for the solution. So I've ordered every cabinet secretary to participate in a comprehensive review of the government response to the hurricane. 
 This government will learn the lessons of Hurricane Katrina. We're going to review every action and make necessary changes so that we are better prepared for any challenge of nature or act of evil men that could threaten our people. 
 The United States Congress also has an important oversight function to perform. Congress is preparing an investigation, and I will work with members of both parties to make sure this effort is thorough. 
 In the life of this nation, we have often been reminded that nature is an awesome force and that all life is fragile. We're the heirs of men and women who lived through those first terrible winters at Jamestown and Plymouth, who rebuilt Chicago after a great fire and San Francisco after a great earthquake, who reclaimed the prairie from the dust bowl of the 1930's. Every time, the people of this land have come back from fire, flood and storm to build anew, and to build better than what we had before. Americans have never left our destiny to the whims of nature and we will not start now. 
 These trials have also reminded us that we are often stronger than we know, with the help of grace and one another. They remind us of a hope beyond all pain and death, a God who welcomes the lost to a house not made with hands. And they remind us that we're tied together in this life, in this nation and that the despair of any touches us all. 
 I know that when you sit on the steps of a porch where a home once stood or sleep on a cot in a crowded shelter, it is hard to imagine a bright future. But that future will come. The streets of Biloxi and Gulfport will again be filled with lovely homes and the sound of children playing. The churches of Alabama will have their broken steeples mended and their congregations whole. And here in New Orleans, the streetcars will once again rumble down St. Charles and the passionate soul of a great city will return. 
 In this place, there is a custom for the funerals of jazz musicians. The funeral procession parades slowly through the streets, followed by a band playing a mournful dirge as it moves to the cemetery. Once the casket has been laid in place, the band breaks into a joyful second line, symbolizing the triumph of the spirit over death. Tonight the Gulf Coast is still coming through the dirge, yet we will live to see the second line.

HEADLINE: Corporate Coalition Issues Upbeat Report on City Schools

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
The Partnership for New York City, a consortium of the city's top corporations and business leaders, issued a progress report yesterday on Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's effort to fix the public schools, and it found ''a pattern of overall improvement in public education.'' 
 The findings were not surprising, given that the partnership has been a strong supporter of Mr. Bloomberg and his education initiatives since early in his term, when the group advocated loudly for giving the mayor control of the school system. Since then, its members collectively contributed $30 million toward the mayor's creation of a training academy for principals -- a huge sum, even for a group with a long history of giving to the city schools. 
At a news conference yesterday at New York University, Sy Sternberg, the chairman and chief executive of the New York Life Insurance Company, said members of the partnership had commissioned the study, by three N.Y.U. professors, because it wanted to know how the mayor's efforts were faring. 
 He said: ''The reforms are moving the ship in the right direction,'' and ''New Yorkers can feel somewhat optimistic.'' But partnership officials and the professors acknowledged that the scope of the report was extremely limited and that the data had been provided by the city Education Department. 
 Among the findings were that a larger percentage of the school system's budget is being spent on instruction; the number of certified teachers has increased; the cost of school construction has dropped; test scores are up; crime is down; and overall attendance is flat.
 While the professors offered their own analysis of the numbers, the report included no independent field research. And, in cases where the Education Department said it could not provide much in the way of historical data, on high school admissions, for example, the report simply did without it. 
 The professors who helped prepare the report -- Richard Arum, a sociologist; Amy Ellen Schwartz, an economist; and J. Lawrence Aber, a psychologist -- joined Kathryn S. Wylde, the partnership's president, in calling for an independent research institute to compile and analyze data about the school system modeled after a similar program in Chicago. 
 Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein has pledged to create such an institute, and yesterday his press secretary said the chancellor would issue a proposal by the end of the school year.

HEADLINE: Bush in New Orleans: The Speech, and the Future 

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 The president's speech on Thursday night was a transparent effort to redeem himself in the eyes of all caring Americans, who were shocked at his tardy and disorganized response to Katrina.
Yet what disturbs me most is the absence of fiscal responsibility.
 Apparently, he plans to do what he does best: bequeath the cost to posterity. Enough is enough! 
 Congress has the power of the purse and should use it to repeal the Bush tax cuts and progressively raise taxes. Cutting taxes, as a tool to stimulate economic growth, is a deceitful notion unless such reductions in revenue are accompanied by cuts in spending. 
 The national outcry for government to help alleviate suffering and foster recovery makes a mockery of the premise that government itself is a problem and that we should ''starve the beast.''
 This government is ours, and this disaster occurred in our time. It is our responsibility to shoulder the burdens that must now be borne.

HEADLINE: Vowing to Maintain an Annual Rite After the Storm

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LUO

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Sept. 16 

 BODY:
The giant Agamemnon survived. So did the Kevin Costner head from last year's parade. Wolfman just lost a little papier-mache. But SpongeBob needs some major work. 
 In a sprawling patchwork of warehouses across the Mississippi River from downtown, a different kind of recovery from Hurricane Katrina is under way. One worker was busy the other day mending the Styrofoam teeth of an oversize alligator, while another repainted a large catfish -- all part of a headlong rush to get back on track for the annual rite that is the psychic center of this city and could signal its rebirth next year: Mardi Gras. 
''It's certainly some millions of dollars in damage that we have sustained,'' said Barry Kern, president of Kern Studios, the family-run company that produces most of the elaborate floats for Carnival, the several-weeks-long celebration that culminates in Mardi Gras, which falls on Feb. 28 next year. ''But it's nothing that's going to stop us. We're ready to roll.''
 Still, it is unclear whether New Orleans will have the money, the crowds or the heart for a full-blown Mardi Gras, especially the parades that are the season's signature. And as the city struggles to regain its footing, that question promises to take center stage. 
 ''Maybe it has to be primitive, but it still has to happen,'' said Oliver Thomas, president of the City Council. ''It would be an international shame if it didn't.''
 The celebration's contribution to the city's economy has been estimated at more than $1 billion, according to study conducted in 2000 for the Mayor's Mardi Gras Advisory Committee. Mardi Gras is the lifeblood of a cottage industry of bead manufacturers, costume designers and other artisans, as well as hotels, restaurants and taxis that profit from the tourists and residents who jam the streets.
 ''It's equal in size to three Super Bowls,'' Mr. Kern said. ''If we don't have it, it would be devastating.''
 In the storm's wake, the importance of Mardi Gras extends well beyond dollars, many people said. 
 ''Psychologically, I think it would be significant for New Orleans to have some kind of Mardi Gras celebration next year, celebrating that it's back,'' said Sarah Kracke, senior vice president of Greater New Orleans Inc., an economic development group. ''All these things would be extremely valuable to the city and our psyche.''
 Next year will be the 150th anniversary of the first Mardi Gras parade in New Orleans, said Arthur Hardy, who publishes an annual guide to the festivities. In all those years, there have been only a handful of times when revelers did not parade through the streets in the days before Ash Wednesday: during the Civil War, a period of local unrest in 1875, World Wars I and II and the Korean War.
 ''Basically, it's been wars that have stopped Mardi Gras,'' Mr. Hardy said, ''not anything like a little rainstorm.'' 
 Much of how Mardi Gras will look next year is dependent on the more than 50 organizations, called krewes, that put on the raucous parades that stretch over 10 days. Some have histories that stretch back decades, and mythological names like Orpheus, Endymion and Bacchus. Rex, one of the oldest krewes, dating from 1872, suffered some of the worst storm damage, as waters flooded its warehouse, across the Mississippi River from Kern Studios. 
 A major question is whether the smaller krewes will have enough money, and members back in the city, to stage their parades, said Mr. Hardy, who suggested that corporate sponsors might step in to help. 
 Regardless, Kern Studios is plunging ahead with preparations at its warehouses here in the Algiers neighborhood.
 The work begins an entire year before Mardi Gras, said Blaine Kern Sr., who founded the company and is widely known here as Mr. Mardi Gras. As a result, many floats for next year's festivities had already been completed before the storm. ''We're set back, of course, but we were ahead of our schedule,'' Mr. Kern said. 
 Some doors blew off the Kern warehouses, but damage to the floats and props inside was minimal. Signature floats like Orpheus's Leviathan, a giant dragon that blinks with an elaborate fiber-optic system, and Endymion's 240-foot-long riverboat were unharmed.
 The worst damage was the collapsed roofs of two warehouses. But even there, amid the debris, a fragile flamingo on one float remained standing atop spindly legs, ready to go on.

HEADLINE: Late Turnaround Trims Losses for Share Indexes 

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks gained yesterday, narrowing the week's losses as the energy and basic materials sectors improved and the Dow components Exxon Mobil and Intel climbed on upgrades.
 Volume was heavy as options expired, but advances were limited as investors eyed the trade deficit for April to June. The deficit dipped slightly, but still was on track to surpass last year's record of $668.1 billion.
 Foreign investors continued heavy buying of Treasury bonds in July, but economists worry that at some point they will no longer want to hold such sizable sums of dollar-denominated assets. 
 Gains were also curtailed by the University of Michigan's midmonth report on consumer sentiment for September. Dow Jones said the survey, which is available only to subscribers, showed a steep decrease, but analysts weighed whether consumers would really change their spending, or whether they were just distraught by Hurricane Katrina.
 The Dow Jones industrial average outpaced other indexes because it is more heavily weighted toward energy and basic materials stocks, said Ken Tower, chief market strategist for Schwab's CyberTrader.
 ''Neither bulls nor bears seem to be making any headway, unless you look at the Dow,'' Mr. Tower said.
 The Dow Jones industrial average increased 83.19 points, or 0.8 percent, to 10,641.94. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 10.18 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,237.91, and the Nasdaq composite index jumped 14.20 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,160.35.
 Volume on the New York Stock Exchange topped 2.55 billion, compared with 1.62 billion on Thursday.
 Crude oil futures dipped. A barrel of light crude settled at $63, down $1.75 cents, in trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 The market spent much of the week waiting for the Federal Reserve; the economic data tended to be downbeat, but not enough to cause a big sell-off. 
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 36.62 points, or 0.34 percent; the S.&P. declined 3.57 points, or 0.29 percent, and the Nasdaq composite fell 15.16 points, or 0.7 percent.
 Intel rose 26 cents, to $24.81; Exxon Mobil jumped $1.24, to $63.70. Another Dow component, DuPont, whose stock often tracks energy companies because petroleum is one of its basic materials, was also up sharply as oil prices dropped. DuPont rose 41 cents, to $40.51.
 The country's third-largest auto insurer, Progressive, rose $4.17, to $102.02, after it said monthly earnings dropped 43 percent in August, slightly better than expected. Through Wednesday, the insurer had 19,000 claims from Hurricane Katrina. The company had set aside $119.5 million in reserves for the claims. But the $1.09 billion in premiums it wrote was flat from the year-ago period, and Bear Stearns initiated coverage at peer perform.
 American Express increased $1.90, to $59.46, after a court approved its $350 million in financing to Delta Air Lines as the carrier moves through bankruptcy proceedings, according to Dow Jones.
 Terms of the restructuring deal call for Delta to repay the $500 million that the American Express Travel Related Services Company advanced in the fourth quarter of 2004 and first quarter of 2005 as prepayment for the purchase of Delta SkyMiles reward points. Delta rose 10 cents, to 85 cents a share.
 DaimlerChrysler gained $1.51, to $51.68, after it said that it agreed to buy out minority shareholders in a German diesel-engine maker it owns, opening the way for DaimlerChrysler to sell the business. DaimlerChrysler, which is selling almost everything outside its core vehicle business, said it was in talks with several potential buyers.
 Treasury bond prices fell on worries over higher future inflation, question marks over the economy and the prospect of rising federal spending to restore the Gulf Coast after Hurricane Katrina. 
 Rick Klingman, head of Treasury trading at ABN Amro in New York, said the specter of ''stagflation was a risk for the bond market'' should consumer spending drop in the wake of Hurricane Katrina and inflation pick up.
 The Fed's Open Market Committee meets Tuesday and is expected to lift the federal funds rate another quarter percentage point, to 3.75 percent.
 The 10-year Treasury note fell by 16/32, to a price of 9925/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.27 percent from 4.21 percent on Thursday.

HEADLINE: The Union That Can't Throw Straight

BYLINE: By JOSEPH NOCERA

 BODY:
DID you hear the one about the football player who offered to play injured if his team would guarantee his 2006 salary? True story. The player is Matt Birk, a Harvard graduate and four-time Pro Bowl center for the Minnesota Vikings. Last season, despite three hernia operations and chronic pain, he played in most of his team's games. As this season began, though, he had a torn labrum in his left hip -- a painful injury that was a direct consequence of coming back too quickly from last year's ailments.
 Mr. Birk is in the fourth year of a seven-year contract that is supposedly worth $31 million. I say ''supposedly'' because only his $6 million signing bonus was guaranteed. Unlike baseball or basketball, where contracts are binding agreements, a football player's contract is a lopsided thing, heavily favoring team owners. So long as a team wants a player around, he'll get his salary. But if the team cuts him, for whatever reason -- including suffering the sort of debilitating injury so common to the sport -- his contract goes out the window. Under the collective bargaining agreement with the National Football League Players Association, a team is required to pay an injured player only for the year in which he is hurt. After that, if the team decides he's lost a step, well, contract or no, he's out of luck. 
 ''Playing with pain is part of the game,'' Mr. Birk said recently. ''But I felt that I had risked my career by playing injured last year, and probably shortened it. And I wasn't willing to do it again unless the team was going to assume some of the risk.'' So he asked the Vikings to guarantee the $3.94 million his contract called for him to get next year. The Vikings declined. On Tuesday, Mr. Birk went under the knife. He's done for the season.
 I KNOW, I know: it's hard to get too worked up over the plight of the professional athlete in modern America. Many of them make very large sums, and they can sometimes seem annoyingly entitled. (Terrell Owens, anyone?)
 But as the season gets under way, it's worth remembering that the National Football League is one seriously big business. And it is very healthy. Its new deal with the television networks, for instance, calls for the league to receive $4 billion annually starting next season -- money that will be divided equally among all 32 teams. According to estimates compiled by Forbes magazine, no N.F.L. team loses money.
 There is no secret to the league's success. Football is not only extremely popular, it is well marketed and well run. Owners tend to be hard-headed businessmen, while its commissioner, Paul Tagliabue, is a savvy operator, with a knack for getting the owners to see what is in their collective best interest. That's why football has far more revenue-sharing than other sports.
 And one other thing: football has had labor peace for 12 years. ''Labor peace has ushered in an unprecedented era of prosperity,'' said the superagent Leigh Steinberg, in a typical comment. Robert Kraft, the owner of the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots, told me that the league and its players had formed a ''partnership'' for the greater good.
 This so-called partnership emerged only after many years of labor strife. Football was literally two decades behind baseball in accepting free agency, and the union won freedom for its players only after a failed strike in 1987 and a lengthy court battle that the N.F.L. lost, which led to a landmark 1993 collective bargaining agreement. That agreement has been extended four times.
 Although it is bewilderingly complex, the agreement at its core gave players the right to free agency after four years in the league. In return, the players agreed to a salary cap that is pegged to a percentage of N.F.L. revenue. This year, for instance, the cap is about $85 million a team, or about 65 percent of ''defined gross revenues,'' as it's called in the agreement. (Certain revenue is not counted against the cap.)
 The players' union, which has been led since 1983 by the Hall of Famer Gene Upshaw, views this agreement as an unalloyed triumph. ''The players have done extremely well,'' insisted Richard Berthelsen, the union's general counsel. 
 That's true enough if you're, say, Indianapolis Colts star quarterback Peyton Manning, with his $34.5 million signing bonus as part of the $98 million, seven-year contract he signed last year. But despite football's prosperity, players still are paid considerably less than their brethren in baseball or basketball. They have the shortest careers; the average pro football player is out of the game in four years. The cap itself clearly restrains salaries. 
 And, of course, they don't have guaranteed contracts. Because the owners are so conscious of the salary cap, players live in a constant state of anxiety, worried that they'll be cut for ''cap reasons'' or have their contract renegotiated downward. (It happens all the time.) Indeed, these days players sign contracts they know won't be honored in the latter years; the contract terms are merely a way for the team to manage its cap issues. (Don't ask; it's too complicated.)
 Star players with the most leverage get the most guaranteed money, primarily in the form of those signing bonuses, which are amortized, allowing the team to pay a big sum and stay under the cap. Still, even with those big bonuses, only about 50 percent of the money going to football players is guaranteed.
 Why are football owners so adamant about not guaranteeing contracts? One reason is that they're simply a tougher breed than baseball or basketball owners. But the economic reason gets back to Matt Birk. As Andrew Zimbalist, the Smith College sports economist, puts it: ''The lack of guaranteed contracts is a natural outcome of football players getting hurt.''
 After all, there are seasons when dozens of players on one roster will miss at least some games because of injury. If football teams had to pay every player whose abilities were diminished as a result of injury, or had to continue paying a player who had suffered a career-ending injury, there is no way they'd be able to stay within the cap. There would be too much ''dead money'' going to players who weren't playing. 
 What is most surprising about this state of affairs is that the union seems to actually agree with the owners. The argument, as put forth by union officials, is that when a player is cut, the money that would have gone to him doesn't revert back to the owner. Thanks to the salary cap, it reverts to players who are still on the roster. ''The question really becomes whether or not the players who can play should get the money,'' says James W. Quinn, a lawyer with Weil Gotshal & Manges who has represented the players union. 
 Have you ever heard anything so heartless from a union? Isn't it supposed to be representing all the players, not just the ones lucky enough not to get hurt?
 ''They are not getting hurt in some frivolous hobby,'' points out Mr. Steinberg. ''They are hurt applying themselves to the exact task they've been hired to do. This is a risk that ought to be shared in a fairer way.'' (Mr. Berthelsen points out that injured players received union-mandated disability benefits.)
 Mr. Birk, of course, agrees with Mr. Steinberg, which is why he took the stance he did. ''Football contracts,'' he told me, ''are a one-way street. Guarantees are an issue the players really care about, and it comes up every year. And every year, Gene Upshaw tells us it is not what we want. And that's the end of it.'' 
 For his part, Mr. Upshaw takes umbrage at the notion that football players have a bad deal. ''There is nothing that prevents an agent from negotiating a guaranteed contract,''he said. ''There is plenty of guaranteed money in football. It is a very complicated system, and the signing bonus is the guarantee.'' When I asked about Mr. Birk, he said: ''I know his contract. He's getting $4 million a year. I played with plenty of great centers, and they didn't get anywhere near $4 million.''
 Needless to say, the system isn't likely to change anytime soon. Right now, Mr. Upshaw is in the middle of negotiating the fifth extension of the basic agreement. He is insisting on widening the definition of football revenue, and increasing the percentage that goes to the players -- but nothing more radical than that. 
 At the most recent session between owners and players, held on Sept. 8, Mr. Upshaw emerged from the negotiations wearing a smile. Things were going well, he told the news media. Then, according to The Washington Post, he and Mr. Tagliabue, who had just been negotiating on the other side of the table, hopped a private plane together and headed for the season opener between the Patriots and the Oakland Raiders.
 Five days later, Mr. Birk had his season-ending surgery.

HEADLINE: By 2050, an Urban Planet

BYLINE: By PAUL B. BROWN

 BODY:
AT most companies, long-range planning does not typically extend beyond the next 12 months. Corporations that take forward thinking seriously might go out to 2010.
 That's what makes the current issue of Scientific American so intriguing. The magazine projects what the world will look like in 2050, and it is going to be a far different place for businesspeople to deal with. 
People will be older, on average; more of them will live in cities and wealth will be concentrated in fewer hands. Specific projections include: 
 Worldwide population will be 9.1 billion, up from the current 6.5 billion. While that 40 percent increase looks drastic, it represents a substantial slowing in population growth. From 1960 to today, the number of people on earth more than doubled. 
 ''From 2007 forward, urban people will outnumber rural people'' for the first time in history, Joel E. Cohen writes. Indeed, virtually all the projected population growth ''will happen in existing or new cities in developing countries.'' Here's another way to think of that: ''In effect, the poor countries will have to build the equivalent of a city of more than one million people each week for the next 45 years.''
 The proportion of people living in developing countries versus developed ones will have increased. ''In 1950, the less developed regions had roughly twice the population of the more developed ones; by 2050, the ratio will exceed 6 to 1.''
 The graying of the global population will not have proceeded uniformly. ''In 2050 nearly one person in three will be 60 years or older in the more developed regions, and one person in five in the less developed zones.'' 
 MENU MODIFICATIONS -- A magazine devoted to the restaurant industry, Chain Leader, imagines a different world as well, one it is all but lobbying to create. Trade magazines report on what is happening in their industry, explain what those reports mean and analyze trends. But in its current issue, Chain Leader goes much further, convinced it has spotted a major market opportunity.
 Using research from the NPD Group on the eating habits of one generation as its jumping-off point, the magazine urges restaurateurs to change their menu items, in light of the fact that ''baby boomers, particularly those in their 50's, are concerned about their intake of fat, salt, cholesterol and sugar'' and that as a group ''one-quarter of boomers are on a diet and a third are overweight.''
 ''Wise restaurant operators will pay attention as more baby boomers -- a generation comprising 80 million Americans -- become empty-nesters and increase their use of restaurants.''
 The magazine even outlines the first step those restaurateurs should take. 
 Breakfast is a big opportunity, the magazine writes, given that ''NPD says consumers over 50 are more likely to eat breakfast and more apt to do so than younger boomers.''
 ACES -- When the book industry gets around to publishing a title called ''The Poker Player's Guide to Life'' -- and given the current craze it undoubtedly will -- they need look no further than the September issue of Marie Claire to figure out who should write it.
 The magazine interviews Isabelle Mercier, 30, who quit her job as a lawyer in Canada, sold her belongings and moved to Paris to become a poker player. Some of the advice from Ms. Mercier, a winner on the World Poker Tour: ''Be aggressive and intense -- take yourself seriously and others will too.'' 
 ''Quit as quick as you can when you are losing. This can also apply to a deadbeat friendship, a job you hate and other life predicaments.''
 FINAL TAKE -- Maybe it is entrepreneurs who are from Venus and venture capitalists who reside on Mars. Brigham Young University researchers surveyed both groups and asked, ''are entrepreneurs born or made?''
 The results, according to FSB: Fortune Small Business magazine: 75 percent of entrepreneurs felt ''inherent traits are more important'' than experience or skills in ''determining entrepreneurial success.'' Only 44 percent of the venture capitalists felt the same way. PAUL B. BROWN

HEADLINE: Amid the Muck, a Man With a Plan

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Sept. 15 

 BODY:
The Palmetto Apartments, a cluster of two-story buildings where 120 low-income families lived before Hurricane Katrina, is a grim sight. By now, the water, which had been more than six feet deep in the buildings, has retreated. Left behind are battered walls, mud-caked rooms, warped wood floors and mold climbing toward the ceilings. The grounds, still swampy, smell like a fetid barnyard.
 The term dead loss comes to mind. But to Quentin Dastugue, the chief executive of a large New Orleans real estate company that owns, manages or leases more than a dozen major properties in the city -- including pricey condominiums at the edge of the French Quarter and downtown luxury real estate space -- reviving this badly damaged affordable housing project is a priority.
Mr. Dastugue (pronounced DAS-toog) led a group of investors, lured by federal tax credits for renovating low-income housing, that bought the property last fall. They had been halfway through a major renovation -- new walls, new windows, new bathrooms and new appliances. Now they have to start over. But even as residents are just beginning to be allowed to return, Mr. Dastugue has already arranged for a construction trailer to be set up next week, powered by its own generator, to begin the reconstruction effort. 
 ''It's a terrible shame; we had made so much progress,'' he said, surveying the damage this week. ''But if we in New Orleans can't provide housing for lower-wage working folks who work in the hotels, restaurants and small service businesses, the tourism and conventions and all that will not come back. We've got to hit the ground running.''
 Business leaders like Mr. Dastague are not waiting for politicians, government officials, engineers and city planners to take charge of rebuilding New Orleans. They are starting to do it themselves. 
 They certainly are counting on plenty of help from the federal government, as President Bush promised in his speech Thursday. But even before the money for reconstruction flows in, local land owners and business executives are pressing their case that a fast start is crucial if the economy of southern Louisiana is to recover. The first 100 days or so, they say, must be used to build a sense of momentum and optimism that New Orleans and the surrounding region will come back, not just as it was but as a rebuilt and improved place. 
 Attention now is understandably focused on the immediate recovery, but big questions loom about what path a ''new New Orleans'' should take and what it might look like. And that path will be shaped in many ways by business leaders and civic leaders like Mr. Dastugue, a former Louisiana state representative who is also co-chairman of an initiative by business, government and community leaders to try to make the New Orleans metropolitan area a more attractive place to live, work and invest, called ''Top 10 by 2010.''
 It is a daunting, and some would say, an all but impossible goal. An estimated 70,000 businesses across the 10 parishes of southern Louisiana have been displaced or severely disrupted by the hurricane, according to Michael Olivier, Louisiana's secretary for economic development.
 More than 90 percent of those companies are small businesses, Mr. Olivier said in an interview, and many may not survive the wait for their insurance claims or loans from the Small Business Administration. So, Mr. Olivier went to Washington for a four-day trip that began Tuesday seeking help.
 ''Our greatest worry is that we need to get businesses back up and running and we need to get the work force back,'' Mr. Olivier said. ''And you need at least something for everyone, not only businesses but the worker bees as well.''
 That view seems to be shared in Washington. The measures in the aid plan presented by President Bush on Thursday included tax relief, loans and loan guarantees for small businesses, as well as funds for workers of up to $5,000 each.
 The surest bet in the recovery, local economists say, will be the big companies in oil production and refining, shipbuilding, ports and petrochemicals. 
 ''These companies will make herculean efforts to get back up and running because they have a lot of money invested and a lot of money on the line every day,'' said Loren Scott, an economist at Louisiana State University. ''The big question is the tourism and convention industry, and small service businesses. How much of the diaspora of people and businesses who left will come back?''
 By nature, Mr. Dastugue is an outgoing, glass-is-half-full optimist. At each of four security checkpoints he drives past in New Orleans, operated by out-of-state Army and National Guard troops, he offers friendly thanks and encouragement. ''Where you from?'' he greets them. ''Thanks for coming, guys.''
 Despite the destruction, Mr. Dastugue recognizes the opportunity of a clean slate to work from in rebuilding -- ''an urban planner's dream,'' he noted.
 His vision of a rebuilt New Orleans is not a smaller city built primarily around tourism, as some have suggested, but more of a huge refurbishing project. It is an opportunity, as he sees it, to rebuild and overhaul the roads and transit system for better traffic handling; build new levees and water control systems to ease flood dangers; put in new state-of-the-art fiber optic telecommunications to attract high-technology companies; rebuild schools and rethink urban education.
 ''We have a chance to correct some things here and use a lot of federal money to do it, and legitimately so,'' he said. 
 His wife, Penny, also sees opportunity behind the disaster, and as a member of the Louisiana State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education, she will have a voice in planning the course for rehabilitating damaged schools. The New Orleans school system is deeply troubled. 
 ''If we rebuild what we had, shame on us,'' said Mrs. Dastugue, who regards the post-hurricane situation as an opening for changes like charter schools, smaller schools and career academies.
 She hopes that teachers' unions and some local politicians who have resisted experiments in the past will endorse such programs with the prospect of more money and a fresh start. Will they? ''I don't know,'' Mrs. Dastugue replied.
 Indeed. And whose ideas prevail in any ''new New Orleans'' initiatives will probably be a matter of intense political debate.
 For now, though, the focus is mainly on bringing the New Orleans region back to life and getting businesses up and running -- tasks that pose huge challenges but also a lot of business opportunities.
 Mr. Dastugue's company, Property One, which he founded two decades ago with his brother, Paul, provides a glimpse of the economic crosscurrents already emerging in the area. 
 Property One's headquarters, now shut, is in a high-rise office building across the street from the Superdome. It has branch offices in the New Orleans suburb of Mandeville, along with Lafayette and Baton Rouge elsewhere in Louisiana. The company also has projects in Mississippi, Texas, Alabama and Florida. 
 Property One could easily move its headquarters, as some companies already have. But the 49-year-old Mr. Dastugue, whose great-grandfather emigrated from France to become a butcher in the French Quarter, is a sentimental opportunist where New Orleans is concerned.
 ''For every person who leaves, that creates a tremendous opportunity for everyone who stays because there's less competition,'' he said.
 The fear, of course, is that if the recovery staggers early then the local market will be far smaller. The ones who left, then, could be the smart money.
 All Property One's business in the city of New Orleans is in hiatus or is gone. But just across Lake Pontchartrain in the suburb of Mandeville, it has a development of 64 condominiums. Until Katrina, sales had been sluggish.
 Except for losing two roofs, the development, on high ground, escaped damage. In two days last week, 44 condominiums were sold to displaced families and companies seeking housing for their employees.
 Mr. Dastugue said he held the pre-hurricane price of about $90,000. ''To be honest, we debated that and decided we were not going to charge whatever the market would bear,'' he said. 
 In a Baton Rouge office complex, Property One leased more than 400,000 square feet of space last week to displaced companies and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. ''It's a checkerboard: in some places, there is a frenzy of business, and elsewhere properties look like they should be bulldozed,'' Mr. Dastugue said. ''We don't really know how it will sort out for us.''
 Nearly all his company's 70 employees evacuated. Mr. Dastugue stayed behind to look after the properties, but sent his wife and three daughters to Dallas. A falling pine tree split the roof of his home in Mandeville, but he patched it up a few days later. His brother's home in nearby Metairie is still under water.
 Mr. Dastugue is continuing to pay his employees, and found housing for some of them in his properties. He has already heard, though, from a few who are not coming back. Often, the leasing or brokerage deals they worked on were in New Orleans, and they have decided to move on rather than wait for business to recover while not receiving commissions, which is a big part of their income.
 At Property One, payrolls are every two weeks. ''We'll start to get a better idea of who's going and who's staying by the next payroll,'' he said.
 At the Palmetto Apartments, despite the devastation, Mr. Dastugue hopes to get some of the least damaged units ready for occupancy in a few months and all of them rebuilt by next April.
 For the city of New Orleans, Mr. Dastugue said that one goal should be to have the city rebuilt enough by late February for Mardi Gras, probably with shortened parade routes. The city should aim to be ready for conventions, he added, by the second quarter of 2006.
 Those may prove to be demanding targets, Mr. Dastugue conceded. After all, one of the truisms of construction projects -- even a simple kitchen renovation -- is that they take longer and cost more than originally planned.
 But ambitious goals, he said, are needed to get things moving with a real sense of urgency and political will.
 ''Part of the recovery is an engineering feat,'' Mr. Dastugue said. ''But there is also the confidence issue that business and government are going to have to deal with -- that this recovery is really moving forward quickly. How that confidence issue turns will determine the future of New Orleans.''

HEADLINE: The 6 Percent Solution: Skip Real Estate Agents

BYLINE: By DAMON DARLIN

 BODY:
Stan and Gloria Wakefield are no fools. They built their three-bedroom house 12 years ago in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla., an oceanside resort community dotted with golf courses and picturesque inland waterways. The real estate market in the area, near Jacksonville, took off and the house, overlooking lagoons, rose in value to nearly $1 million. ''This house has appreciated almost obscenely, '' said Mr. Wakefield, a retired naval intelligence officer. 
 What the Wakefields did next should scare real estate agents everywhere.
They decided to put their house on the market this year, and concluded that the house would sell itself. So why pay a real estate agent a 6 percent commission? They tried negotiating a lower commission with prospective agents, who stood to make about $60,000, but the best they could get was 4.5 percent -- and 5.5 percent if the agent had to share the commission with a buyer's agent. 
 They chose instead to list their property with one of the many real estate services that are challenging conventional brokerage firms, in this case, Assist2sell.com, an agency that charges a flat fee instead of a commission. The Wakefields had an offer within six days and sold their home for $985,000, paying a $10,000 fee to Assist2sell and $14,775 to the agent who brought in the buyer, for a savings of about $30,000 over a conventional broker.
 ''Enough to pay off the boat,'' a 26-foot pocket cruiser, Mr. Wakefield said.
 This is subversive stuff. Homeowners across the United States are figuring out that they do not need to pay what agents demand and they may not need an agent at all. At the same time, technology is giving consumers tools to nearly circumvent the agent. If enough people try it, agents are at risk of losing a good portion of their commissions -- $100 billion last year. 
 So, agents are doing whatever they can to keep home sellers from paying less.
 Anyone who wants to know how to outfox them first has to understand where they derive their power: information. They know the market -- or presume to know it -- and help set the price of your house. They serve as the go-between and, again presumably, know how far you can push the other side.
 (Note, however, that agents don't always push for the best price. Steven D. Levitt, co-author of ''Freakonomics,'' and Chad Syverson, both University of Chicago economists, found that real estate agents have an incentive to persuade their clients to sell their houses too cheaply and too quickly because a few thousand dollars more in price won't yield them a significantly higher commission.) 
 But more than anything else, agents control access to the Multiple Listing Service, where all the houses for sale in a community are listed. The M.L.S. is the most powerful tool in real estate because it informs the widest pool of buyers that a home is for sale. Not open houses, not fliers, not big ads in the newspaper. ''The M.L.S. is king,'' says Brett Weinstein, an Oakland, Calif., discount broker who prefers to be called ''a full-service reduced-fee agent.''
 The M.L.S. is also a tool that agents use to protect their commissions. The problem for agents is that some of their colleagues are offering to list houses for a small flat fee, sometimes for less than $500. You sell it yourself, though you would be obligated to pay a 3 percent commission to any agent who brought you a buyer -- in essence paying that agent for all the Sundays spent showing other houses to clients who never bought anything. That half-price deal is dangerous enough for a full-commission firm. But it gets worse.
 In every community there are agents who open the M.L.S. to the public on the Internet (erealty.com has a fairly comprehensive list, or you can go directly to realtor.com, the Web site of the National Association of Realtors). They do it as a service to clients who want to buy a house -- 70 percent of homebuyers now peruse listings on the Internet, the association's most recent survey says -- as well as to cut their costs of showing clients the paper listings. Some even rebate part of their commission to buyers who do their own research on prospective homes.
 But some buyers just freeload. (The Internet has a way of encouraging this behavior.) They can search the M.L.S. for a house with no brokerage firm listed, meaning it's being sold by the owner, and then work out a no-commission deal directly with that owner. So you can see where this is headed. If agents want to protect their commissions, they have to restrict access to the M.L.S. to sellers who are working with them, not going it alone.
 Local realty groups have tried suing agents or brokerage firms that put ''for sale by owner'' listings in the M.L.S., accusing them of copyright infringement. Those agents have countersued, charging restraint of trade. Then two years ago, the Realtors association found what it thought was a better solution. It passed rules that essentially allowed a local M.L.S. service to block access to the listing service to any brokerage firm who discounted commissions or who posted listings for homeowners who intended to sell their own houses. The antitrust division of the Justice Department cried foul. This month it sued the Realtors' trade group, asserting that the rules stifled competition and hurt consumers. 
 The Realtors changed the rules just as the federal case was filed. But J. Bruce McDonald, deputy assistant attorney general, said that the group's policies continued to discriminate against innovative brokers and ''stifle competition at the expense of home buyers and sellers.''
 In a news release, the Realtors association said it was ''at a loss to understand'' the Justice Department's legal action. ''Many of the changes incorporated in the new policy are in direct response to concerns they have raised over the course of the two-year investigation," it said.
 The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have successfully fought state real estate boards that tried to limit consumer choices by imposing service requirements or forbidding commission rebates, but the fight goes on. Realtors have lobbied for and won state laws that prohibit commission rebates to buyers and require minimum levels of service, like requiring that an agent handle all negotiations or house showings. Federal regulators can't fight that.
 Aaron Farmer, a discount real estate broker in Austin, Tex., has battled local and state realty boards to offer cheaper services. The Justice Department and the F.T.C. intervened to help him. Nevertheless, he has had to raise his fees to $700 from $600 because of the minimum service levels required by a law recently passed by the Texas Legislature. (Eight states have enacted such laws, accepting the real estate industry's argument that they are needed to protect consumers.) ''All of these fights are over the M.L.S.,'' he said. ''They don't want price wars.'' 
 But price wars are coming. No doubt about that. Here are a few suggestions on how to take advantage of the changing environment to sell your home with minimum services from -- and fees to -- a broker: 

Set the price
Being a nosy neighbor is still the best way to know the market. Walk though every open house and find out later what the house sold for.
 For the shy or decorous, technology offers an alternative. Homesmartreports.com will give you a sales analysis of your home based on prices for comparable homes in the immediate neighborhood. The $25 report is far more useful than cheaper versions from Domania.com (free) or Equifax.com ($7) because it gives you greater confidence that its high and low estimates are accurate by indicating the strength of your local market and by noting anomalies like a high number of foreclosures or house-flippings, where homes are bought with the idea of fixing them up and quickly reselling them.
 Homesmartreports plans to offer a service for home buyers, too, that would provide an unlimited number of reports over a 30-day or 90-day period so you can get a better idea of how much to offer for a house. 

Get listed
Some of the new sales services try to sidestep the M.L.S. As listings proliferate openly on the Web, the M.L.S. may one day be less important. But for now, in all but the hottest markets, it pays to get into the M.L.S.
 Almost every community has a discount broker who will charge $300 to $800 just to type the information about your house into the local M.L.S. (Some will also take pictures of the house to run with the listing.) 
 There is one caveat: If you list there, you may be obligated to pay a commission to the buyer's agent, which is usually set at 3 percent. You can, however, build that commission into the price of the home, so the buyer actually pays it. Or, if the housing market is particularly hot in your area, you may be able to write into the contract that the buyer is responsible for paying his agent's commission.

Hand off the annoying stuff
For many sellers, the hardest part is all the details: staging the home for showings, holding the showings and handling all the paperwork and the negotiations. Many discount brokers offer an a la carte menu of services, which can quickly add up to more than a set commission.
 Paperwork is not that hard to do if your discount broker gives you all the preprinted forms. (You can probably foist some of that work on the buyer's agent, who is really working for you anyway.) Alternatively, go with a sales service that for a higher fee of about 1 percent of the selling price will handle everything. But these services often don't include an M.L.S. listing. 
 As for stagings and showings, watch a few shows on the cable channel HGTV, like ''Sell This House,'' to learn how decluttering or putting on a fresh coat of paint will raise the value of your home.

 The average real estate commission rate has slipped, but because of soaring home prices, the actual average commission has risen.

HEADLINE: Confidence Index Plunges to 13-Year Low 

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Consumer confidence plummeted to a 13-year low in early September, battered by record high gasoline prices and Hurricane Katrina, a report showed yesterday.
 Separate data showed the current account deficit, the broadest measure of United States trade with the rest of the world, narrowed in the second quarter but remained at levels seen as unsustainable over the long term.
 The University of Michigan's closely watched consumer sentiment index fell to 76.9 in September, from 89.1 in August, far below Wall Street forecasts and the 81.8 rating after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. 
 The current conditions dropped to the lowest level since December 2003 while the expectations index plummeted to the lowest level since February 1992.
 ''If these declines were part of the normal economic cycle we would now call for a recession in the United States,'' said Ian C. Shepherdson, the chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics. ''But they aren't; the index is responding to a shock, and we expect it quickly to rebound.'' 
 The result was similar to trends in other consumer surveys.
 ''I think there's probably also a degree of loss of confidence in the government,'' said David Sloan, an economist at 4Cast in New York. 
 Analysts said the University of Michigan index suggested that consumers, after months of stoicism in the face of rising gasoline prices, have reached a tipping point. For some Americans, gas prices well over $3 a gallon in some areas threaten the sustainability of the suburban S.U.V. shopping-mall lifestyle.
 Moreover, disturbing images from the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina stirred discussion of broad social and economic inequalities in the country, adding to concern about the nation's direction. 
 Analysts note that consumers often sing the blues but rarely cut spending as a result. Still, the latest drop in confidence was termed a worry for retailers.
 Earlier, the Commerce Department said the current account deficit narrowed in the second quarter to $195.7 billion, but the previous quarter's record deficit was revised even higher.
 The quarterly shortfall, the second highest on record, compared with Wall Street forecasts for a deficit of $193 billion. The first-quarter gap was revised to a record $198.7 billion from $195.1 billion.
 The quarterly current account deficit ran at 6.3 percent of gross domestic product in the second quarter, compared with 6.5 percent in the previous three months.
 Economists and Federal Reserve officials have warned that such levels are unsustainable over the long run and represent a serious imbalance in the economy.
 The deficit partly reflects high levels of consumption and an extremely low savings rate. Foreign investors are left to finance the gap. 
 ''The trade deficit remains the single most important tax on U.S. growth and burden on American workers,'' said Peter Morici, professor of international business at the University of Maryland.

HEADLINE: I.B.M. Unveils Plan to Train Employees to Be Teachers 

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
Faced with a chronic shortage of science and math teachers, American education officials have long blamed the country's lucrative high technology industry for luring potential teachers to higher-paying positions in business.
 But yesterday, I.B.M. announced a new program intended to begin to reverse the cycle by paying to train some of its veteran employees for second careers as teachers. I.B.M. officials said they hoped other companies would follow suit.
The program, ''Transition to Teaching,'' was announced yesterday at Public School 19 in Manhattan by Stanley Litow, a former deputy chancellor of the New York City schools who is now president of the I.B.M. International Foundation. 
 Mr. Litow said that the program would be geared to I.B.M. employees in their early 50's who are preparing to retire, but he said that it would be open to all employees with at least 10 years of experience and some prior community service work. 
 In an interview, Mr. Litow said that after he unveiled the program he received e-mail messages from about 50 people interested in participating. He said the company would begin the program with 100 employees in New York State and North Carolina, two states where I.B.M. has a large number of employees. 
 ''There are a lot of people who are interested in teaching, and they didn't make that choice the first time because of economic circumstances,'' Mr. Litow said. 
 I.B.M. employees accepted into the program will continue to work for the company while completing coursework required to become a certified teacher and will be granted a paid leave of absence to complete three months of student teaching. 
 I.B.M. will pay up to $15,000 per employee for tuition and stipends. To be eligible, employees must have worked for I.B.M. for at least 10 years, have a bachelor's degree in science or math or a higher degree in a related field and experience as a teacher, a tutor or a volunteer in a school or other children's program. 
 Mr. Litow said the program would help place the newly trained teachers in public schools.
 Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein and the state education commissioner, Richard P. Mills, joined Mr. Litow during yesterday's announcement.
 ''New York needs more people with math and science skills to meet the growing job demand, but we need more teachers to make that happen,'' Mr. Mills said in a statement. 
 New York City officials said that about half of all new science teachers and three-quarters of new math teachers came through alternative certification programs, in which people who did not formally train as teachers can qualify for a license.

HEADLINE: In Catskills, It's Development vs. the Drinking Supply

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DEPALMA

DATELINE: DELHI, N.Y., Sept. 12 

 BODY:
The graceful obelisk in front of the Delaware County office building here solemnly commemorates the noble sacrifices of Catskill Mountain men during the Civil War. 
 But the monument also serves as an unwelcome reminder that the population of this huge county -- at 1,460 square miles nearly the size of Rhode Island -- has not changed since Lee surrendered at Appomattox.
That kind of long-term stagnation is one reason James E. Eisel Sr., chairman of the Delaware County Board of Supervisors, is so upset by a state administrative law judge's recent decision to indefinitely hold up a proposed $250 million resort project -- and all the jobs it may provide for the county's 48,000 residents -- while additional environmental studies are done. 
 Much more is at stake here than the economy of a rural county framed by picture-book farms and verdant valleys. The county lies within New York City's upstate watershed, which provides water so clean that the city is exempt from federal laws requiring drinking water to be filtered, so long as its source is protected. 
 New York's plan to protect the watershed depends, in part, on keeping local communities on its side. And right now, Delhi (pronounced DELL-high) and other towns and hamlets do not see eye-to-eye with the city. 
 The pastoral peace is being disturbed by a complicated mix of economic worries and environmental concerns, of old-economy notions of job creation set against new-economy opportunities as yet untapped. At its heart, this latest dispute is another episode in the long-running upstate-downstate feud, but with a twist because some of the upstaters used to be downstaters. 
 There may be no harder place in New York than this to build a project as big as the one known as Belleayre Resort at Catskill Park. The principal developer, who is from the area, has proposed a world-class resort, about 125 miles from Manhattan, consisting of two luxury hotels, two championship golf courses, and hundreds of time-share apartments and single-family houses. 
 What makes getting building permits so tricky is that the resort would be built next to an existing state-owned ski slope within the watershed, and near state forest preserves that are constitutionally guaranteed to remain ''forever wild.'' 
 An administrative law judge decided last week that after nearly two years of hearings and a 6,720-page environmental-impact statement, a dozen issues needed to be studied further. Among the areas the judge found lacking are how to deal with storm water runoff, preserve wilderness vistas and community character and assess the impact on wildlife. 
 ''Impacts to wildlife, come on,'' Mr. Eisel said, expressing his frustration at the latest delay of a project he supports because he believes it will be an economic boon for Delaware County and the Catskill region. ''I guess we've got to bring in deer and ask them what they think.'' 
 He and other local officials also fear that the latest delays could undermine the project altogether and send an unmistakable message that no sizable development in the watershed will ever be approved. 
 ''If you can spend as many millions of dollars as these developers have spent and not even get halfway into the approval process, who's going to be the next to try it?'' said Robert G. Cross Jr., supervisor of the town of Shandaken, in adjacent Ulster County, where part of the Belleayre project would be built.
 Mr. Cross said the project had caused a schism in the area between those who want economic development and those who want to restrict growth. 
 Balancing local needs against those of New York City has led to a century of antagonism and resentment. But under federal pressure to cooperate or be forced to build a $9 billion filtration plant, New York signed an agreement in 1997 that formally recognized the watershed communities' need for economic development. 
 For their part, the local towns and villages agreed not to stand in the way of the city's attempts to protect the watershed by purchasing more land. 
 Belleayre is the biggest test of the agreement, and some local officials feel strongly that New York is abrogating its commitment by openly opposing the development. 
 New York officials say their first responsibility is to protect the water supply. They, and several environmental and outdoor groups, believe that the project, as proposed, would irreparably harm water quality.
 Hanging above this particular dispute is the possibility that federal officials would look unfavorably on a rift that threatened watershed protection when permission to avoid filtering comes up for renewal in 2007. 
 ''The filtration-avoidance agreement is dependant on there being a working agreement between New York and the communities west of the Hudson,'' said Daniel A. Ruzow, a former state environmental official who is the lawyer for the Belleayre developer, Dean Gitter. 
 Mr. Ruzow said that although Mr. Gitter is extremely frustrated by the delays, he has no plans to withdraw from the project. He has decided to appeal the administrative law judge's decision. 
 While the procedural legal battles continue, a subtle change in the local economy continues apace. The region's economy traditionally has been based on tourism and the Catskills' distance from the congestion and pollution of the city. A small but growing number of people, most of them transplants from New York City, say distance is now irrelevant. 
 Using the Internet as their link to the city, photographers, graphic designers, Web designers, publicists, writers and real estate agents are finding ways to conduct their business in the mountains. Most of them oppose the Belleayre project, and prefer to see the area remain as it is. But they have brought change with them. So many are interested in living in the area that a local real estate company has just opened a branch office in TriBeCa, and Shandaken recently approved the construction of its first cellphone tower.
 Three years ago, Stephanie Blackman and Mark Loete moved their graphic design and studio photography business from Manhattan to the mountains. They bought a rambling old duplex house in Chichester, a part of Shandaken that began as a furniture-making company town in the 19th century, and have retained nearly all their Manhattan clients. 
 Julie McQuain and her husband, John Carney, have been operating their public relations business out of what used to be their second home in Hardenburg, in Ulster County, since 1998. They helped form a business-support group called the Catskill E-Business Exchange to help other ''wired professionals'' make the transition to country life. 
 And in Delhi, the county itself is acknowledging the new economy by building an e-business incubator where entrepreneurs can rent offices with broadband Internet access as they expand their businesses. 
 Glenn Nealis, Delaware County's director of economic development, said that while Web-based entrepreneurs are important, they cannot provide the jobs the country needs, which will only come from big projects like the Belleayre resort. 
 But Ms. McQuain, who opposes the Belleayre project, says that such thinking shortchanges local residents. 
 ''The people who are coming here from more-urban settings are bringing the technology up, but that is also the future for the younger generation of local families,'' she said. ''They shouldn't aspire to making beds. They should aspire to the kind of higher-paying jobs that can be theirs.''

HEADLINE: Realtors Bubble. Skeptics Blog.

BYLINE: By DAN MITCHELL

 BODY:
HURRICANE KATRINA will lift home prices across the country, the National Association of Realtors declared this week. News outlets that picked up the story passed it along wholesale. MarketWatch.com presented a news release rewrite at the top of its home page with its usual screaming headline. 
 It was left to real estate bloggers to provide context. The association's conclusions seem reasonable: the need to rebuild hundreds of thousands of units will cause a spike in demand for building materials, which will push up construction costs. The storm's impact will restrain mortgage rates. And with inventories already tight nationally, prices can't help but rise, according to David Lereah, the group's chief economist. 
''The 'general tight inventory' Lereah speaks of is rapidly ending,'' counters David (no last name given), who writes the Bubble Meter blog and who pointed out that the association was hardly a disinterested observer of real estate markets. Bubble-watchers abound in blogland. There are the Housing Bubble Blog, the Boy in the Plastic Housing Bubble, the Global Bubble Trouble Blog and many others. Most of those not operated by Realtors or others with an interest in ever-rising prices -- and even some that are -- tend to be skeptical of the market prognostications of Realtors. 
 ''The market wants people to buy, spend and repeat, so they're exhorting eager buyers to ignore common sense and take risks they may not be ready for,'' said the blog run by Housing.com, an independent online listing service. 
 MAKING GOOGLE EYES -- Some national governments are expressing dismay over Google Earth allowing the world to see their military installations and other government assets. The Register, a technology news site based in Britain, tested Google Earth's abilities in this regard, and presented its findings online. Among the photos taken from Google's bank of satellite images were an Awacs plane parked on the tarmac at Udorn Air Force base in Thailand and a very detailed shot of an Australian nuclear reactor.
 Thailand and South Korea have been the most vocal critics. Others are less exercised. ''You have to live with the fact that almost everything is on the Internet,'' said a Sri Lankan general. And Australia's nuclear power officials say that Google's images don't show any critical infrastructure.
 ''At this point, we're getting the feeling that the South Koreans and Thais may be overreacting a tad,'' The Register concludes. ''What's more, they're not looking at the plus side: if Vietnam and North Korea are as we speak eagerly filling their broadband boots with Google-supplied military secrets, what's to stop us exploiting the same resource?''
 FALSE ALARM -- There was a short panic in blogland this week after someone wrote to the keeper of the PVRBlog to warn that his TiVo box had informed him that an episode of ''The Simpsons'' that he wanted to save was ''flagged'' by copy protection software -- the episode would self-destruct at a certain date. 
 Reporters from CNet and elsewhere quickly determined that the flag was just a software bug, but some TiVo devotees remain convinced that they may soon be unable to save their favorite shows. Sure, it was just a bug, writes Matt Haughey of the PVRBlog, but it ''demonstrates what could very well happen in the near future with TiVos and other sorts of P.V.R. devices.'' Once the ire is worked up, it's hard to just let it go.
 DEPRESSING DOG FOOD -- In April, the Kroger Company announced that it would begin selling Disney's Old Yeller dog food in its 2,500 stores. Now bloggers, including boingboing.net, are picking up packages to photograph for communal snarkery. Many of them are asking how the marketing staffs of two major corporations got past the fact that in the movie, Old Yeller contracts rabies and must be shot dead? ''What's next,'' asks one reader of the My Houston blog. ''Bambi's Mother salt lick?'' DAN MITCHELL

HEADLINE: In New Orleans, Businesses Take First Steps Back

BYLINE: By The New York Times

 BODY:
As New Orleans struggles to get back on its feet, the city's employers will play a major role. In some areas, it could be months before business returns to normal. But many employers, particularly the biggest ones in some crucial industries, are already beginning to reopen and bring employees back, often helping them find housing and supplying transportation. Here is an overview of employment in the city and in the center of tourism, the French Quarter.

Banks
Hibernia National Bank: 3,000
Whitney National Bank: 2,500
Of 107 Hibernia branches, 56 have reopened. About 20 branches were significantly damaged; others are waiting for power to be restored. At Whitney, 108 of 148 branches have reopened.

Hotels/Casinos
Marriott: 2,800
Harrah's New Orleans Casino: 2,600
Hilton: 2,000
Hyatt: 450
One Marriott hotel has reopened; two more will reopen next week. The Hyatt Regency will be closed through 2006, but it is accepting reservations for 2007. Most Hiltons are not taking reservations. Harrah's is closed and does not know when it will reopen. Some of its employees are looking for work at other Louisiana Harrah's casinos in Lake Charles and Baton Rouge.

Universities
Tulane: 6,000
L.S.U. Health Sciences Center: 5,000
University of New Orleans: 3,350
Tulane intends to reopen for spring semester. The health sciences center, which is the main medical training facility in Louisiana, evacuated to Baton Rouge, where classes will resume Sept. 26. The University of New Orleans wants to conduct classes at its lakefront campus by Dec. 1.

Hospitals
Oschner Clinic: 6,500
Tenet Healthcare: 4,400
HCA: 2,600
Touro Infirmary: 2,000
Oschner's main facility was just outside the hardest-hit area and has remained open. Tenet's Kenner Medical Center is reopening, but Memorial Medical Center and Lindy Boggs are closed indefinitely. Touro is shut, as is Tulane University Hospital (which is jointly owned with HCA).

Shipbuilding/Aerospace
Northrop Grumman: 6,700
Lockheed Martin: 2,000
Northrop's Avondale shipbuilding yard partly reopened Monday. So far, 1,800 employees have gone back to work. Lockheed's Michoud assembly plant builds the external fuel tanks for the space shuttle. It is not expected to reopen before Sept. 26.

Utilities
Entergy: 2,800
BellSouth: 2,000
Entergy's two main buildings, where 1,400 employees worked, were flooded and are now empty. BellSouth's 35 locations avoided major damage as did their phone lines in the central business district, the French Quarter and the Garden District. Not all locations shown.

Within a month, he predicts, he should be able to open 150 rooms or so.Musee Conti Wax MuseumThe wax museum depicted the birth of New Orleans, but it will not include the rebirth. Katherine Spurlock, the owner, thinks the 154 life-size figures have melted, although she has not been able to enter the museum yet. Her grandfather brought the figures, devoted to New Orleans history, from Paris in 1963 and they have been in climate-controlled rooms since. ''I don't have any plans to reopen,'' she said. ''I don't see us surviving the damage.''Rat's HoleDennis Booth, 46, has spent the last two weeks sleeping on the second floor of the Rat's Hole, a narrow barshop on Bourbon Street. In better times, Mr. Booth works security at the Rat's Hole, but now spends each sweltering day without electricity, gas or drinkable water, talking to reporters and tossing beads to National Guard troops. The owner, Mr. Booth said, plans to return when the curfew is lifted.French MarketIn the French Market, a landmark collection of stores that hug the Mississippi River levee, handwritten signs warn, ''Looters will be shot on sight.'' The Cafe du Monde, usually open 24 hours a day, is quiet. Nearby, in the market, signs of looting: a few cash registers pried open. At Loretta's New Orleans Authentic Pralines, the cash register is vandalized, but pralines remain untouched in trays in the display case.Preservation HallA white cat often seen in this legendary jazz club is outside the barred and shuttered doors. It is fed dry cat food and water by Walt and Ronda Rose, a couple who own a nearby shop. The club is intact, but some of the local musicians who play every night have not been located yet. Even so, hall managers say they can be ready to open soon.Saks Fifth AvenueThe three-story Saks Fifth Avenue was the anchor of an upscale shopping center. Now, its first floor has been flooded and looted and its top floor has sustained heavy fire damage. ''We are closed indefinitely,'' said a company spokeswoman, Julia Bentley. Saks will continue to pay its 230 New Orleans employees for 90 days and is offering to help with relocation costs for transfers to other stores.

HEADLINE: Bush Rules Out A Tax Increase For Gulf Relief

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and EDMUND L. ANDREWS; Carl Hulse contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 16 

 BODY:
President Bush said Friday that rebuilding the Gulf Coast would ''cost whatever it costs,'' that he would not raise taxes to pay for the recovery and that at least some of the expense would have to be offset by budget cuts in other programs. 
 His call for some sacrifices in the federal budget came just a day after he addressed the nation in prime time from an outdoor lectern in New Orleans, where he promised to rebuild the city and the surrounding Gulf Coast, heavily damaged by Hurricane Katrina. Mr. Bush used a national day of remembrance for the storm victims on Friday to expand on the themes of racial injustice that he touched upon the night before, telling a packed service at the National Cathedral, ''As we clear away the debris of a hurricane, let us also clear away the legacy of inequality.''
Taken together with his speech in Jackson Square on Thursday night, Mr. Bush's comments were part of an effort to shift the focus to promises of rebuilding and recovery and away from criticism that the White House had been callous in its slowness in helping the storm victims, many of them black. 
 The White House on Friday also offered a few more details about the president's proposals to provide incentives for rebuilding and to assist displaced residents with homesteading land and money for job retraining. The Gulf Opportunity Zone program he outlined on Thursday would offer special tax breaks to businesses and would cost about $2 billion; school vouchers, worth up to about $7,000 for displaced students, could be used for private as well as public schools. Administration officials are also considering a suspension of the steep import tariffs now imposed on cement from Mexico, lumber from Canada and numerous forms of steel.
 Again on Friday, Mr. Bush put no price tag on the rebuilding, although others have said the federal government will quickly run through the $62.3 billion already approved in relief aid by Congress, and could wind up spending as much as $200 billion. 
 At a news conference in the East Room with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Mr. Bush offered no suggestions about what kind of cuts might be made or whether he would revisit the $24 billion in pet projects for members of Congress that were in the $286.4 billion transportation bill he recently signed into law.
 But he explicitly ruled out tax increases to pay for the reconstruction and relief costs, saying, ''We got to maintain economic growth.'' He continues to press for a permanent extension of his tax cuts, which would cost $1.4 trillion over 10 years. 
 Mr. Bush defended the additional tax breaks that he was recommending for businesses in the Gulf of Mexico region, saying they would not be expensive. ''Look, there's not going to be any revenues coming out of that area for a while anyway, so we might as well give them good tax relief in order to get jobs there and investment there,'' he said. 
 The escalating bills for the damage wrought by the hurricane have begun worrying members of Congress, with a growing number of Republicans distancing themselves from what they view as unchecked spending by the White House. Congress had already been poised to make $35 billion in spending cuts over the next five years, some in Medicaid, the health care program for the poor.
 Even before the hurricane struck, budget analysts on Capitol Hill were bracing for rising deficits as a result of financial burdens including the war in Iraq and the Medicare prescription drug benefit program. On Friday, Congressional deficit hawks said they were pleased by the president's call for efforts to compensate for the burgeoning cost of the storm recovery, though they would have preferred that he had included it in his New Orleans speech. 
 ''I think there are plenty of places to go to work, starting with Congressional earmarks,'' said Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, referring to pet projects lawmakers place in bills like the transportation measure, which included a $250 million bridge to a small Alaskan island that has 50 residents.
 Representative Mike Pence, Republican of Indiana, said the Republican Study Committee, a group of House conservatives, planned to unveil a series of potential cuts next week. Lawmakers have suggested delaying the start of the new Medicare drug program and eliminating programs that the White House, in its budget earlier this year, called expendable. 
 Claude Allen, assistant to the president for domestic policy, said aides had not focused on specific spending cutbacks. ''I cannot name any programs that will be cut,'' he said. And Al Hubbard, director of the White House National Economic Council, told reporters that the government would have to borrow money to pay for the costs of the storm. 
 ''Well, there's no question about it: the recovery will be paid for by the federal taxpayer, and it will add to the deficit,'' Mr. Hubbard said. 
 Brian M. Riedl, a longtime budget analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group, said Mr. Bush needed to lead the efforts for budget cuts.
 ''Thus far, President Bush has not vetoed a single bill and has allowed Congress to spend too much money,'' he said.
 Mr. Riedl has published a new budget forecast that projects soaring deficits as a result of the hurricane, the war in Iraq and the Medicare drug program. All in all, he said, the budget deficit is likely to hit $520 billion in 2008, up from about $400 billion this year.
 Democrats were quick to criticize the president's fight to extend his tax cuts, which Congress has postponed considering for at least the next month. Representative John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee, pointed to the long-term effects of those extensions. 
 ''The president should acknowledge the consequences of what he's talking about,'' Mr. Spratt said, adding that the combined cost of Mr. Bush's tax proposals -- including a possible repeal of the alternative minimum tax -- could hit $2 trillion over 10 years. ''This will clearly preclude cutting the deficit in half over the next five years.''
 Some of the president's new proposals still have no cost estimates. His plan for ''urban homesteads'' would provide surplus federal property to displaced families for almost nothing in exchange for a commitment to build or renovate any buildings on the property as homes. White House officials said the Department of Housing and Urban Development had about 4,000 houses or apartments on which it has foreclosed, with about 1,000 of those in or near New Orleans.
 As for the Gulf Opportunity Zone, companies would be allowed to immediately write off 50 percent of their investment in any new equipment. Small businesses would be able to write off the cost of all new equipment, up to $100,000. Supporters of low-tax zones say they attract employers to areas that are most in need of jobs. But critics say they often just attract companies that were already planning to invest nearby, pulling jobs from one neighborhood to another without increasing overall employment.
 In an effort to bridge the divide along race and economic lines that was exposed in the storm's aftermath, Mr. Bush has promised that minority-owned businesses will benefit from the enterprise zone. 
 The themes of race and poverty were made evident by several speakers at the prayer service at the National Cathedral early in the day. T.D. Jakes, a conservative black minister of a large Dallas church, the Potter's House, told those in attendance -- including some evacuees from New Orleans -- that Katrina ''has made us look and think and dare to discuss the unmentionable.'' At several moments he seemed to look right at Mr. Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who was sitting behind the president and has spoken frequently in recent days about the poverty revealed by the hurricane, which also struck her native Alabama.
 Mr. Bush acknowledged those facts when he said in his brief comments at the service, ''This poverty has roots in generations of segregation and discrimination that closed many doors of opportunity.'' He said it was his challenge to ''deliver new hope to communities that were suffering before the storm.''
 ''As we rebuild homes and businesses, we will renew our promise as a land of equality and decency,'' he said. ''And one day, Americans will look back at the response to Hurricane Katrina and say that our country grew not only in prosperity, but in character and justice.''

HEADLINE: A Frustrating Week at the U.N. for the White House Team

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN; Joel Brinkley contributed from the United Nations for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 16 

 BODY:
After weeks of trying to rally international support to confront Iran over its nuclear program and to reform the United Nations, the Bush administration has had an unusually frustrating week, rebuffed by crucial partners and also by a coalition of poor countries increasingly resentful of American power.
 The result is that the drive to press Tehran over its suspected nuclear weapons program has stalled, as have efforts to introduce sweeping budgetary changes at the United Nations and to scrap the United Nations Human Rights Commission.
''The work of diplomacy doesn't always proceed at the pace you would hope,'' a senior State Department official said, saying he could be more candid if not quoted by name. ''Do we wish the results of a week of diplomacy would be more clear-cut? Yes. But at least everybody feels we're moving in the right direction.'' 
 The Iranian situation has been at an impasse for weeks, as the United States and its European partners have sent envoys to countries around the world to rally support for a vote at the International Atomic Energy Agency's board meeting next week to refer Iran to the United Nations Security Council for possible condemnation or sanctions.
 But India and Russia have balked, despite personal appeals by President Bush. At the White House on Friday, President Vladimir V. Putin again expressed misgivings about rushing things with Iran.
 ''I'd like to point out that the potential of diplomatic solutions to all these questions is far from exhausted,'' Mr. Putin said, adding that it was necessary to take steps ''to settle all these problems and issues, not to aggravate them, not to bring them to extremities.''
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India, who met with Mr. Bush at the United Nations earlier in the week, made the same point in an interview on Friday morning. ''I don't think we should rush to the Security Council,'' he said. ''I think more efforts could be made to evolve a consensus.''
 In light of these and other rebuffs, European and American diplomats said Friday that they thought they had about 20 votes out of 35 on the nuclear agency's board to refer Iran to the Security Council. While that would be enough to accomplish the goal, they were not sure whether to proceed with such a slim majority. ''At this point our options are still open,'' the senior State Department official said. Echoing European officials, he said that a final decision would be made after a speech on Saturday by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran at the United Nations, where he is expected to offer his own proposals for breaking the impasse with the West. 
 The tactical concern among Americans and Europeans is that, in the absence of a broad consensus, a vote sending Iran to the Security Council could embarrass the West, guarantee that the Council would not act quickly and possibly embolden the Iranians themselves.
 ''If we get a narrow majority at the I.A.E.A., the likelihood of doing anything reasonable in New York is not great,'' said a top European diplomat involved in the Iran talks. ''It's probably a smart idea to take a little more time to pressure the Iranians.''
 Since the beginning of President Bush's second term, and since an early incantation from Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice that ''the time for diplomacy is now,'' a main priority has been to align American and European strategies on Iran.
 By all accounts, that effort has been successful, and Washington has worked with Britain, France, Germany and the European Union to let the Europeans offer economic and political incentives for Iran to suspend its uranium activities and to discuss a permanent end to its suspected nuclear weapons programs.
 That phase appears to have reached an end, especially now that Iran has rejected the European incentives and resumed conversion of raw uranium into a gas that Western experts say is a precursor to making weapons-grade fuel.
 What the Europeans and Americans failed to count on are the views of other countries, especially in the developing world, who have not rallied to their side. 
 These countries are swayed by Iran's contention that it has done nothing that violates any international treaties on nuclear energy, except by failing to disclose elements of its program, and that inspections have failed to turn up any proof that Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons. 
 Six weeks ago, a European official said, Europe and the United States felt that these countries would line up with the West on the atomic energy board. Now, they are not so sure.
 A similar rebellion by countries outside the ambit of Europe and the United States appears to have thwarted some of the changes sought at the United Nations.
 There, Bush administration officials insist that they are pleased with some of the changes adopted by the United Nations General Assembly this week, notably a broad definition of terrorism. They say they tried to address the wishes of the developing world by agreeing at the last minute to endorse specific goals to increase foreign aid.
 But when it came time to adopt stringent budgetary changes at the United Nations, cementing fiscal and personnel authority with the Secretariat under Kofi Annan and taking some of it away from the General Assembly, the votes were not there.
 Neither were there enough votes to scrap the United Nations Human Rights Commission and replace it with a council that would not be led by countries like Sudan or Cuba, which the United States and its allies consider bad actors in the human rights sphere.
 The scandals of the last couple of years in the oil-for-food problem in Iraq, with favoritism and corruption in the awarding of contracts, might have been avoided if the secretary general's office had exercised greater control over the budget and personnel, now in the hands of a committee made up of all members of the General Assembly.
 ''The way the United Nations is run, the vast number of less developed countries sitting in the General Assembly hold the power of the purse,'' a diplomat at the United Nations said. ''A lot of developing countries see giving more authority to the secretary general as a ploy by the U.S. and the Europeans to take more control of the U.N.''

HEADLINE: Don't Push Syria Away

BYLINE: By Joshua Landis. 
Joshua Landis, a professor of Middle Eastern studies at the University of Oklahoma, is a Fulbright scholar in Damascus who writes the blogSyriacomment.com.

DATELINE: Damascus, Syria 

 BODY:
BASHAR AL-ASSAD would have been the first Syrian president in 40 years to visit the United States had he attended the United Nations summit meeting in New York this week as planned. And it could have been an opportunity for two countries that have notably tense relations to talk. Instead, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice delayed his visa, excluded him from a meeting of foreign ministers to discuss Lebanon and Syria, and had a United Nations investigator arrive in Damascus at the time of his departure. Boxed in, Mr. Assad canceled his plans.
 Ms. Rice's actions were in keeping with what Bush administration officials say their goal is toward Syria, to ''continue trying to isolate it.'' Many in Washington argue that Syria is the ''low-hanging fruit'' in the Middle East, and that the United States should send it down the path to ''creative instability,'' resulting in more democracy in the region and greater stability in Iraq. But this is a dangerous fantasy that will end up hurting American goals. 
Mr. Assad's regime is certainly no paragon of democracy, but even its most hard-bitten enemies here do not want to see it collapse. Why? Because authoritarian culture extends into the deepest corners of Syrian life, into families, classrooms and mosques. Damascus's small liberal opposition groups readily confess that they are not prepared to govern. Though they welcome American pressure, like most Syrians, they fear the deep religious animosities and ethnic hatreds that could so easily tear the country apart if the government falls. 
 Nonetheless, Washington seems to be pursuing a policy of regime change on the cheap in Syria. The United States has halved Syria's economic growth by stopping Iraqi oil exports through Syria's pipeline, imposing strict economic sanctions and blocking European trade agreements. Regular reports that the United States is considering bombing Syria, and freezing transactions by the central bank have driven investors away. Next week, United Nations investigators will begin interviewing top officials in Damascus about the bombing death of the anti-Syrian politician Rafik Hariri in Lebanon, a matter that many expect the United States will bring before the Security Council. Politicians and businessmen alike here are convinced that Washington wants to bring down the regime, not merely change its behavior.
 Nonetheless, the two countries have much to talk about: both are trying to solve their Iraq problems. They share a common interest in subduing jihadism and helping Iraq build stability. But instead of helping Syria help the United States, Washington prefers to make demands. The Bush administration believes it will be an easy matter for Mr. Assad to crack down on the Syrian Sunnis, who are giving comfort and assistance to mostly Arab fighters traveling though Syria. 
 On the contrary, it would be extremely costly for Mr. Assad. Sunni Arabs make up 65 percent of the population and keeping them content is crucial for any Syrian leader. 
 Syria has already taken the easy steps. It has built a large sand wall and placed thousands of extra troops along its 350-mile border with Iraq. Foreign diplomats here dismiss the American claims that the Syrian government is helping jihadists infiltrate Iraq. All the same, Syria has not undertaken the more painful internal measures required to stop jihadists before they get to the border, nor has it openly backed America's occupation of Iraq.
 Nor is Mr. Assad -- who inherited his job from his father, Hafez, in 2000 -- willing to make a wholesale change in his authoritarian policies. But he has worked hard to repair sectarian relations in Syria. He has freed most political prisoners. He has tolerated a much greater level of criticism than his father did. The religious tolerance enforced by the government has made Syria one of the safest countries in the region. Washington is asking Mr. Assad to jeopardize this domestic peace. 
 Worse, if Mr. Assad's government collapsed, chances are the ethnic turmoil that would result would bring to power militant Sunnis who would actively aid the jihadists in Iraq. Mr. Assad is a member of the Alawite minority, a Shiite offshoot that fought a bloody battle against Sunni extremists in the 1980's. For Mr. Assad to help the United States, he must have sufficient backing from Washington to put greater restrictions and pressure on the Sunni majority. It would be suicide for him to provoke Sunnis and extremists while Washington seeks his downfall. 
 Those in Washington who insist on fighting Mr. Assad because he is not democratic are hurting Iraq's chances for a peaceful future. The United States needs Syrian cooperation in Iraq. This will require real dialogue and support, not snubs and threats. Washington must choose between destabilizing Syria and stabilizing Iraq.

HEADLINE: A Bright Spot in Germany's Economy Seems to Be Fading

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
THREE years ago, as Gerhard Schroder sought a second term as German chancellor, he had to defend a record that included economic growth that had been slower than in most other European countries, not to mention the United States.
 But there was one area in which German performance was extraordinary: foreign trade. Not only was the country running a trade surplus over all, but its surplus with China was large and growing. While the United States fretted about its growing deficit with China and protectionist pressures grew, Germany was selling ever more to the Chinese. 
This weekend, as German voters decide whether to confound the pollsters and keep Mr. Schroder in office, that bright spot is no longer shining so clearly. Germany's trade surplus with China peaked in the summer of 2004, when the 12-month total was $8.1 billion. The last figure, through this July, showed a surplus of just $377 million. China has run a trade surplus with Germany in five of the seven months reported so far in 2005.
 The change may say more about China's economic changes than it does about Germany's. China's rapid growth in recent years was partly fueled by imports of machinery and other equipment to expand production of various products, and Germany is a leading provider of such equipment. More recently, Chinese expansion has slowed, while production from its newer factories has come online, producing more products for export, with some of them going to Germany. In the most recently reported 12 months, China's exports to Germany rose 40 percent from the previous 12 months, while its imports rose only 2 percent.
 That trend may be contributing to worries in much of Europe that the Continent's economic competitiveness is slipping. Many Germans save rather than spend. The latest figures reflect a savings rate of 10.6 percent of income, a little higher than it was at the last election. (That compares with a savings rate of around zero in the United States.)
 That savings has helped to hold down German economic growth. During Mr. Schroder's second term, German gross domestic product has grown at an average annual rate of just 0.5 percent a year, among the slowest in the industrial world. But domestic demand has risen at the anemic rate of only 0.2 percent a year. The rest of the growth reflects exports. 
 Unemployment has remained stubbornly high. Europe publishes ''harmonized'' unemployment rates, which are comparable across countries, and by that measure Germany's latest unemployment rate was 9.3 percent, lower than it was a few months ago. But it is higher than it was when Mr. Schroder was first elected in 1998, on a platform that criticized his Christian Democratic predecessor, Helmut Kohl, for not creating enough jobs.
 If the polls prove to be correct, that lack of jobs under Mr. Schroder will be a big factor in his losing his own.


GRAPHIC: Chart: ''German Performance''Since Gerhard Schroder narrowly won a second term as chancellor of Germany three years ago, the German economy has trailed most major countries in growth, in large part because of weak domestic demand. Unemployment has also risen. Germany's strength has been in exports, but even Germany has found it increasingly difficult to compete with China.Graph tracks annual G.D.P. growth rate, annual domestic-demand growth rate, and unemployment rate for the following countries:GERMANYITALYFRANCEBRITAINJAPANU.S.German trade surplus with China12-month surplus, Chinese government figuresGraph tracks German trade surplus with China for Schroder's first term Sept.

HEADLINE: World Leaders Gather, Models Model, and New York Endures It All

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
Naomi Genuard tried. She really tried. But with 153 world leaders leading their entourages around town and 180 fashion shows showing off the latest looks and streets blocked off and traffic inching along in fractional increments, was it her fault that she was late for work every day last week?
 ''I can't wait until next week,'' Ms. Genuard, an executive assistant in a financial firm in Manhattan, said on Friday. ''I understand what's going on was important, but when you're a commuter and you're paying $5 one way to take the bus from Brooklyn, that's a lot of money.'' 
But now New York is breathing a sigh of relief. It survived the world summit celebrating the 60th anniversary of the United Nations and Fashion Week.
 Taxis and buses can once again go across town in less time than it takes to slog through ''War and Peace,'' or at least the Cliffs Notes version. 
 Regulars can get reservations again for dinner before 9 p.m. Multimillionaires can go to parties at the Guggenheim Museum without having to pass through a checkpoint like airplane passengers not in the private-jet set.
 Conference organizers will not have to worry whether the men in this president's entourage or that prime minister's retinue are armed.
 And people like Dorothy Randall, trudging toward her apartment on the Upper East Side after abandoning a bogged-down bus, will not hear what she said she overheard on the police radios of officers outside the Carlyle Hotel: ''The president of Greece is stuck in the elevator.'' 
 Now New York can treat last week like just another headache that finally -- mercifully -- went away. Some will remember it as worse than the World Economic Forum or the Republican National Convention last year. Some will insist it was not that bad. But there was an undeniable edginess as the leaders crisscrossed the city and the models crisscrossed the runways. 
 ''With what happened in New Orleans and Mississippi, I think it brings back a little of 9/11,'' said Fern Berman, who owns a public relations firm in Manhattan, ''There's a sadness for the people there and a tenseness here. You have all the world leaders here, almost four years to the day after 9/11, and on top of it, you have the feelings we've all been feeling for the people whose lives have been devastated. The cabdrivers were tenser, and talking about New Orleans.''
 Not all the time, of course. They were also tense about the street-level havoc wreaked by the world leaders. 
 ''If they didn't go home soon, everybody would have a mental breakdown,'' said Jerry Tierstein, a town car driver. ''They took the town over. The city made made special lanes for them on 57th and 42nd. Really ridiculous. It took the rest of us hours to get across town. I'm glad the week is over. Get them out of here.''
 His worst trip of the week began Wednesday afternoon when he picked up a customer on 72nd Street near Central Park West. The destination was the Waldorf Hotel and Towers on Park Avenue, the home-away-from-home for many of the presidents and diplomats, including President Bush, attending the world summit at the United Nations.
 ''Between Madison and Park, it took me almost 30 minutes to go one block. That's even worse than Christmas in New York, and for George Bush? I know we're a blue state, but this is ridiculous. Thirty minutes. One block.''
 Things were better on Friday, but not much better. Caroline Stoessinger, a pianist and teacher, hired a car-service driver ''to be sure I could get where I needed to be on time.'' Where she needed to be was 320 Park Avenue, diagonally across from the Waldorf, for a noontime talk by the Irish foreign minister, Dermot Ahearn. Where she was coming from was John Jay College of Criminal Justice, where she teaches.
 ''Normally, I could have done everything in 10 or 15 minutes in a taxi,'' she said. The car-service car worked the edges of the West Side, slinking down 11th Avenue and turning east on 52nd Street--where, she said, ''we sat for what felt like half the day.''
 ''The extra expense, the extra time, the extra anxiety,'' she said. ''Your heart's racing: will I get there in time?''
 For the power-lunch crowd, the question was whether they would get in. Some restaurants said they were booked. ''No question about it, especially during lunchtime,'' said Julian Niccolini, an owner of the Four Seasons restaurant, at 99 East 52nd Street. ''It was really, really busy during lunchtime, and we really upset a lot of our regular customers, especially on Wednesday. We got overbooked. We couldn't accommodate our regular people.''
 Ms. Genuard said her hourlong express-bus trip grew to an hour and 40 minutes. In the morning, the bus zipped up Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive to its usual exit at 23rd Street. It whizzed east and made the right onto Madison Avenue.
 That was where the zipping and whizzing ended. She said it took 30 to 40 minutes to reach 57th Street, but she got off before that and just walked. She was so frustrated that on Friday morning, she took the subway from Brooklyn. It was no faster, she said.
 The wait for an express bus home in the evening stretched from 5 minutes to about 20. And, standing at the bus stop on 57th Street between Madison and Fifth Avenues as motorcades sped by, she realized that things were noisier than usual, as if that were possible.
 ''Every taxi, limousine service car, every bus -- they were all honking horns at the same time,'' she said. ''I was already jumpy enough as it was.''

HEADLINE: Lafayette Hopes, and Fears, It Will Become the New New Orleans 

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: LAFAYETTE, La., Sept. 15 

 BODY:
With its strong Cajun traditions, Mardi Gras celebrations and drive-through daiquiri bars, this southern Louisiana city has long sparred with New Orleans for the right to call itself a capital of relaxed revelry, the arts and French-influenced folkways.
 But as its rival lies in ruins and tens of thousands of evacuees pour in, Lafayette suddenly faces some far different struggles: an accelerating culture clash and a debate over whether the city can, or even wants to, become the new New Orleans.
While larger cities like Houston are able to absorb hordes of newcomers without much upheaval, Lafayette is undergoing a huge transformation, its population of 110,000 swelling virtually overnight to more than 150,000. The city, fueled by the fortunes of the petroleum industry, was already growing because of rising oil prices. Now, as it extends a welcoming hand to its neighbors, Lafayette has taken on the trappings of a strained boomtown, with bumper-to-bumper traffic, back-fence talk of a crime wave and fears of a housing crunch. 
 ''The New Orleans crowd came in and changed everything,'' said Chris Deshotel, 24, an employee at a financial services company who had placed an offer on a $165,000 house last week, only to be outbid by a New Orleans family who bought the property with cash. ''I'm sorry about their situation, but I'm sorry about my situation, too.''
 Others, though, are excited about the potential economic benefits from both the population surge and the efforts to rebuild New Orleans, 130 miles to the east. Nidal Balbeisi, the owner of Zeus, a Middle Eastern restaurant in downtown Lafayette, said he could not hire people fast enough to help cook meals that are sent to 1,500 relief workers each day in New Orleans. 
 ''It's the craziest thing I've ever seen, and I immigrated to this country from Kuwait after the Saddam invasion,'' he said. 
 Civic leaders are buoyed by the prospect that Lafayette could supplant New Orleans, at least temporarily, as a center for art and jazz, street parties and tourism. In the last week, a benefit concert was held for unemployed musicians from New Orleans as was an outdoor fair where displaced artists sold their paintings. 
 ''We're the entertainment capital of Louisiana now,'' said Gerald Breaux, executive director of the Lafayette Convention and Visitors Commission. ''We're the place where the artists are going to migrate to.'' 
 On a superficial level, at least, few places seem as well equipped to help keep alive the playful culture of New Orleans as Lafayette, which has the bars and vibrant music scene of the larger city, as well as the state's biggest population of Cajuns -- descendants of French Canadians who were expelled from Acadia in the 18th century. 
 Still, Lafayette differs significantly from New Orleans in many ways, from its politics and demographics, to the way its gumbo is prepared (no tomatoes), to its economy, which relies more on the offshore oil industry than on tourists. And in the other city's shadow, Lafayette has labored to assert its own identity, until now.
 ''A worldview has been turned on its head, in part because New Orleans used to view Lafayette as its poor country relation,'' said Carl A. Brasseaux, director of the Center for Louisiana Studies at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. ''A lot of those differences immediately dissolved with the storm as people here rushed to help any way they could, but it remains to be seen how long the system can afford to sustain this transformation.''
 More than 40,000 people from the New Orleans area have arrived in the last two weeks, including more than 1,000 who have camped out at the Cajundome complex. Lafayette schools have taken in more than 3,000 new students, and there is evidence of extraordinary generosity throughout the city.
 But the sudden influx has also set off tensions. In the first days after the storm, a false rumor swept this city that evacuees had stolen a large cache of firearms from Shooters, one of the largest gun shops in Lafayette. Managers assured frantic callers that they had plenty of guns, and over three days, the shop sold more handguns than it had sold in the previous eight months, said a manager, Al Bernard.
 ''We also started requiring our salesmen to pack a gun in their holster,'' said Mr. Bernard, 63. ''Just in case someone from not around here comes in and gets the wrong idea, we want him to know there will be swift response.'' The police said there had been no rise in crime. 
 One longer-term test of the changes will lie in the tolerance Lafayette extends to some of its new guests. Joey Durel, the president of Lafayette City-Parish, refused last week to grant a permit to the organizers of Southern Decadence, a gay festival in New Orleans that had tried to transfer the event to Lafayette. 
 ''I don't consider anything that's got the word 'decadence' in it to be normalcy,'' Mr. Durel was quoted as saying in The Daily Advertiser, Lafayette's main newspaper. 
 Lafayette is a predominantly white city with a culture that is more rural than that of New Orleans, and its politics tilt more Republican than those of its mostly Democratic rival. Largely Roman Catholic and Cajun, it is removed culturally as well as geographically from the Bible Belt of northern Louisiana.
 ''Lafayette is just much more conservative than New Orleans,'' said Richard Angelle, a principal at Petroleum Solutions, an energy consulting firm in Lafayette. ''New Orleans is 65 percent black, which means more Democrats and less Republicans.'' 
 Much of that could change if the evacuees stay. 
 Oil services companies hungry for workers have put up help-wanted signs in the Cajundome, though it is not clear how many evacuees have the training needed for those positions.
 Many of the storm's survivors have little inclination to go home. ''It's better here than New Orleans,'' said Latoya McCallon, 18, who was smoking a cigarette outside the Cajundome. 
 Ms. McCallon, who worked at Wal-Mart before fleeing her home city, said she wanted to study at a college in Lafayette. ''I feel there's good opportunity here,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Even in Iraqi City Cited as Model, Rebuilding Efforts Are Hobbled 

BYLINE: By CRAIG S. SMITH

DATELINE: NAJAF, Iraq 

 BODY:
In April, Najaf's main maternity hospital received rare good news: an $8 million refurbishment program financed by the United States would begin immediately. But five months and millions of dollars later, the hospital administrators say they have little but frustration to show for it.
 ''They keep saying there's renovation but, frankly, we don't see it,'' said Liqaa al-Yassin, director of the hospital, her exasperated face framed by a black hijab, or scarf. ''Each day I sign in 80 workers, and sometimes I see them, sometimes I don't.''
She walks a visitor through the hospital's hot, dim halls, the peeling linoleum on the floors stained by the thousands of lighted cigarettes crushed underfoot. Anxious women, draped in black head-to-foot chadors, or veils, sit in the sultry rooms fanning their sick children. 
 ''My child has heart problems, she can't take this heat,'' pleaded one mother as Dr. Yassin walked past.
 The United States has poured more than $200 million into reconstruction projects in this city, part of the $10 billion it has spent to rebuild Iraq. Najaf is widely cited by the military as one of the success stories in that effort, but American officers involved in the rebuilding say that reconstruction projects here, as elsewhere in the country, are hobbled by poor planning, corrupt contractors and a lack of continuity among the rotating coalition officers charged with overseeing the spending.
 ''This country is filled with projects that were never completed or were completed and have never been used,'' said a frustrated civil affairs officer who asked not to be identified because he had not been cleared to speak about the reconstruction. 
 Najaf would seem to be one of Iraq's most promising places to rebuild. As a Shiite holy place, it has few Sunnis and, as a result, none of the insurgent attacks and sabotage that plague other parts of the country. Just a year after fighting between American forces and Shiite militias left much of the city in smoking ruins, a new police force is patrolling the streets and security in the city has been handed over to Iraqis. 
 There are some successes. The Army Corps of Engineers has finished refurbishing several police and fire stations, one of which has shiny new fire engines donated by Japan. It is spending tens of thousands of dollars to refurbish crumbling schools and has replaced aging clay water pipes in the suburb of Kufa with more durable plastic ones. It is even spending half a million dollars to renovate the city's soccer stadium, putting in new lights and laying fresh sod.
 But in a series of interviews, American military officers and Iraqi officials involved in the reconstruction described a pattern of failures and frustrations that Army officers who have worked in other parts of Iraq say are routine. Residents complain that the many of the city's critical needs remain unfulfilled and the Army concedes that many projects it has financed are far behind schedule. Officers with the American military say that corruption and poor oversight are largely to blame.
 ''We were told to stimulate the economy any way we can, and a lot of money was wasted in the process,'' said Capt. Kelly Mims, part of the Army liaison team that maintains an office in Najaf's local government building. ''Now we're focused on spending the money more wisely.''
 He said the Army was forming a committee with provincial authorities to create a master list of all current and future projects so that the money goes where it is most needed.
 Several agencies are charged with reconstruction in Iraq. In Najaf it is primarily the work of the Army Corps of Engineers and the United States Agency for International Development. 
 They award some projects to foreign contractors, many of them American companies that hold master contracts for reconstruction work. Other projects are awarded directly to Iraqi companies, but even the American companies subcontract much of the work to Iraqis. A handful of Army reservists and civilian employees hand out cash to Iraqi contractors and try to keep track of the projects they underwrite.
 But American officers say there is almost no oversight after a contractor is given the job. The Army pays small Iraqi contractors in installments -- 10 percent at the outset, 40 percent when the work is half done, 40 percent on completion and the final 10 percent after fixing problems identified in a final inspection. On larger projects, contractors are paid by the month, regardless of how much work is actually done.
 Penalty clauses for missing deadlines are rare, and some contractors drag out their projects for months, officers say, then demand more money and threaten to walk away if it is not forthcoming. 
 Maj. William Smith, charged with overseeing most of the reconstruction work in the area, walks around the bright blue pipes and yellow tanks of an unfinished water treatment plant outside of town. A control panel with its array of monitoring lights sits baking in the sun beside broken bags of filtering sand. The plant was supposed to be finished in June, but the feed pipe from the river has not even been connected; it was buried unmarked and now has to be relocated.
 ''Sometimes, the only way to go is to pay off the contractor and put it out for new bids,'' the major said with a weary chuckle. He said the water treatment plant was one of four that he was considering repossessing, even though he has paid out more than $200,000 on each one.
 Major Smith says that contractors can technically be blacklisted. But they simply change the names of their companies and submit bids for new projects, ''and we don't really have a choice but to use them'' if they submit the winning bid, he said. That is because the United States blacklists only companies, not individuals, he said. 
 Army engineers have to scrutinize tenders carefully because contractors sometimes leave out major pieces of equipment to lower their bids, he said. Once the contract is awarded and the omission is discovered, the Army is forced to pay more to complete the project.
 All bids must be submitted in English and the companies are required to have an English-speaking representative on site whenever the Americans visit, but they rarely do, many officers said.
 At a United States-financed health clinic going up on the outskirts of town, Major Smith resorts to pantomime as he tries to make himself understood to an eager foreman. In response, the foreman draws furiously in the sand, but all a bemused Major Smith can say is, ''O.K., O.K.'' He promises to return with an interpreter in a few days, but even that message is lost.
 Driving through the city, Major Smith points out a new, $5.5 million sewage treatment plant, built by Bechtel with funds from the Agency for International Development. The plant was completed in February but was not commissioned until August because no one in Najaf had been trained on how to operate it. The agency said that it was now operating at full capacity, serving 141,000 people. But a similar plant has sat unused in the nearby town of Diwaniya since its completion last December, also for lack of trained personnel. An agency spokesman said it was expected to begin operating in September.
 Muhammad Yusef al-Yasiri, an engineer who sits on the project committee of Najaf's city council, grumbled that the Americans hired contractors and handed out projects without consulting the local institutions involved. ''Even the hospitals have no idea what kind of work is being done,'' he said. As a result, he added, ''the money isn't going to the right places.''
 He cited the Al Sadr Teaching Hospital, which was caught in last year's crossfire between coalition forces and fighters loyal to Moktada al-Sadr, son of the grand ayatollah for whom the hospital is named. Mr. Sadr's fighters used the hospital's high floors to fire on a coalition base nearby before being driven out. 
 After coalition troops pulled out in July last year, looters moved in, carting away almost anything of value. To refurbish the hospital, the Army hired the Parsons Corporation, a private engineering and construction company that has been awarded a master contract to build and renovate hospitals and health centers throughout the country. It was paid $2 million to lay new linoleum and hang new ceiling tiles in the hospital's ground floor, drain the flooded basement and fix the central air-conditioning.
 But the work has not assuaged angry doctors whose first priority is to replace the equipment lost in the looting, which they say the United States should have prevented in the first place.
 A resident doctor who gave his name as Ather led a visitor through the hospital, pointing out where the advanced equipment once stood. Looters damaged the magnetic resonance imaging machine and stole the control unit of the CT scanner. The large white doughnut of the scanner sits idle in a pristine room, untouched by the fighting. Only two of the hospital's four X-ray machines remain.
 In the emergency room, a family sat on a blanket eating a lunch of bread, grilled meat and cucumbers. ''This was Najaf's most advanced hospital,'' he said with distress. ''A lot of money has been spent on the rehabilitation of this hospital, but not very much has changed.'' 
 Part of the problem is that much of the money is spent before any work is done. The International Monetary Fund reported recently that a third to half of the money paid to foreign contractors is spent on security and insurance. Importing equipment also eats up cash. Major Smith said the hospital's new boiler, for example, was being shipped from the United States.
 At the maternity hospital across town, Dr. Yassin could hardly disguise her mounting frustration. She said the contractor, the Parsons Corporation, had repaired the hospital's reverse osmosis water purification equipment, but that little else had been accomplished in the five months since the renovation began.
 Only one of the hospital's four elevators is working, and that is the one Parsons left in operation while the others were supposedly being repaired, she said, adding that no one is working on the elevators now. Major Smith said Parsons had completed the work but that it was so shoddy the Army would not certify the elevators for use. He said the company had since agreed to bring in elevator specialists to redo the job.
 Parsons was also supposed to fix the hospital's incinerators, but it completed the work without hooking up gas lines to fuel them, Dr. Yassin said. 
 A Parsons spokesman in California said that all work on the hospital would be completed in November and blamed insurgent activity in the area for the delays. The hospital director, though, said that there had never been any fighting around the site, and that Najaf had been free of major violence for more than a year.
 Dr. Yassin said that, in any event, she would prefer that the money be spent on new facilities and had asked the Ministry of Health to finance an expansion.
 ''Were doing our best, despite this process of rehabilitation,'' she said. ''I hope that they will work faster in the future.''

HEADLINE: Amid Ruins of Home, Sorrow and Solidarity

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN. 
E-mail: wcr@nytimes.com

DATELINE: GULFPORT, Miss. 

 BODY:
THE Caravan of Hope arrived here at 6 p.m. Thursday. For Clarence Weatherspoon and several other professional basketball players, that was when the full force of Hurricane Katrina's tragic impact became real. 
 Weatherspoon was among a group of current and former N.B.A. and W.N.B.A. players who came to Mississippi on a trip arranged by the N.B.A. players union but initiated by the players themselves. 
 The players slowly got off the bus and stared at what used to be a Las Vegas-like strip, once glitzy and glowing and crammed with tourists. The entire coast had been reconfigured. Casinos that had sat on barges were lifted out of the water and slammed to shore. The back of one casino had been ripped off and blown two blocks away. It sat in the middle of a highway. 
 ''I've been to this casino several times because it's the first turn off Route 49,'' said Weatherspoon, a native of Crawford, Miss., who starred at the nearby University of Southern Mississippi. ''Total, total destruction.'' 
 Trucks that loaded and unloaded ships from ports across the highway were twisted in a heap a hundred yards from where they had been parked. The most overriding sensation was the smell: the stench of rotting carcasses was something that television images could not convey.
 ''I have never been in a war zone or anything like that,'' Weatherspoon said, ''but seeing this compared to anything else I've seen -- this is the solid truth.''
 The basketball players' stops here and in Biloxi, Miss., marked the end of a long day that began in Jackson, Miss., at 8:30 a.m. with a news conference held by city officials.
 The governor of Mississippi, Haley Barbour, thanked the players for coming. This was not a full-blown relief effort, but a gesture of good will. The N.B.A. has a lot of players with connections to Louisiana and Mississippi. Ten players were born or live in Louisiana; 12 were born or live in Mississippi. 
 Weatherspoon was one of five N.B.A. players from Mississippi to make the trip. The others were Erick Dampier, Al Jefferson, Justin Reed and Maurice Williams. Another in the group, Purvis Short, a former player and the director of player programs for the players union, is from Hattiesburg, Miss. 
 Others on the trip included Theo Ratliff, vice president of the union, as well as Allan Houston, Samuel Dalembert, Shareef Abdur-Rahim and the former player Greg Anthony, now a TV commentator. The W.N.B.A. was represented by Swin Cash, Cheryl Ford and Tamika Catchings, the president of the W.N.B.A. players union. 
 The group gathered in Vicksburg, Miss., rode by bus 45 miles east to Jackson, then headed 90 miles south to Hattiesburg for food distribution, which was coordinated by Feed the Children, a nonprofit relief organization. 
 Jackson was relatively untouched by Katrina. But as the caravan approached Hattiesburg, the highway became dotted with the rubble of homes and businesses.
 Hattiesburg was faced with cleaning up about a million cubic yards of rubbish. Thirty-five properties were damaged or destroyed. 
 Under a broiling midday sun, the players helped unload food and water. Some carried groceries to trucks and vans. 
 The mayor of Hattiesburg, Johnny L. DuPree, was honest. He said his city got off easy. He warned the players that they would see worse as the caravan moved toward the gulf. 
 Reed, a forward for the Boston Celtics, said he saw himself in the faces of young storm victims.
 ''I come from a single-parent home, and once upon a time we were homeless,'' he said. ''I know how hard it is to start from scratch, to have to build and build and wonder if you're ever going to be able to live like you once lived. I feel what they're going through because I come from a path like that.'' 
 Players individually have performed many good deeds in the wake of the storm. Most have conducted a number of commendable initiatives, from buying books to buying groceries, through their various foundations.
 What Katrina illustrated, quite graphically, is that the economic problems confronting communities from which many professional athletes come are too large for one foundation to solve. If players hope to make an impact, the principles they apply to basketball must also be applied to the arduous process of rebuilding communities. In a word, teamwork.
 ''Much can be done when you pull together as a group rather than trying to do it as an individual,'' said Dampier, the Dallas Mavericks center. ''Through this time, it's going to be very important for us to pull together as a group.''
 On the way back to Vicksburg, the caravan stopped at a fast-food restaurant on Route 49.
 Some of the customers, who seemed startled to see professional athletes standing in line at Chick-fil-A, approached the players. There was joking back and forth, and a lot of photographs were taken. 
 After 45 minutes, the players boarded the bus. They would get back to their normal routines, but the sights and sounds of Mississippi would be etched into their consciousness.
 ''This is a great opportunity to come out and be hands-on,'' said Ford, a native of northern Louisiana who plays for the Detroit Shock. ''I know a lot of us in the N.B.A., N.F.L. and W.N.B.A. have sent out money and checks, but just being out here seeing the people, meeting them, means a lot to them, and it means a lot to us, too. It's a great feeling to be out here, and I'm glad I came.''
 Ford spoke for those in the caravan. It was one of those days they would remember for a lifetime.

HEADLINE: A Fib Here, A Scandal There

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
WHAT you don't know about your hedge fund manager, it turns out, can really hurt you.
 That's one lesson from the debacle at the Bayou Group, a hedge fund firm run by Samuel Israel III, that, federal prosecutors say, defrauded investors of $300 million. While Mr. Israel told investors that he had trading in his blood -- he came from a family that had built a big commodities firm that flourished during much of the last century -- and trumpeted his string of triumphs at firms large and small, the truth is somewhat different. 
Resume inflation, of course, is nothing new. But it can be hazardous when practiced by those in the money business. And particularly so in the wild, wild west of the hedge fund world. 
 It can also be a terrifically effective warning sign. After all, a money manager who thinks nothing of rewriting his career history might be equally happy to cut other corners. (Mr. Israel has not returned phone calls seeking comment.)
 A comparison of Mr. Israel's curriculum vitae in the Bayou Group's sales materials and the one, known as a C.R.D., that is on file with securities regulators, shows some interesting discrepancies. 
 According to both, Mr. Israel -- Sammy to his friends -- began his Wall Street career in 1982 at Frederic J. Graber & Company, a small but respected institutional firm. His timing was propitious: he sat down at the trading desk there in January 1982, when the Dow Jones industrial average hovered around 850. Mr. Israel may not have known it, but the greatest bull market in history was about to commence.
 He was at Graber for six years in all, the longest he stayed in one place during his 23 years in the investment arena. (That does not count his eight years running Bayou, which was based in Stamford, Conn.)
 But he apparently did not make much progress at Graber. According to two salesmen at larger brokerage firms who dealt with him there, he never rose above the level of order-taker.
 For the next five years, according to his C.R.D., Mr. Israel ricocheted around Wall Street, working at start-ups or small firms. Only one of the five jobs that he held in this period shows up in Bayou's sales materials. 
 For example, Mr. Israel's C.R.D. states that he left Graber at the end of 1988 to join Midwood Securities Inc., a start-up brokerage firm where he remained for about nine months. Terry L. March, chief executive of Midwood Securities, was there at the time. He remembered Mr. Israel, but said his performance at the firm was unremarkable. 
 The next move for Mr. Israel was to Gerard Klauer Mattison & Company, an institutional brokerage firm, in November 1989. He traded New York Stock Exchange shares there but left the following May. 
 Mr. Israel left Gerard Klauer in May 1990, joining Gruntal & Company, which was later bought by Ryan Beck & Company. He cleared out of Gruntal 10 months later.
 It was about this time, Bayou's marketing documents say, that Mr. Israel met Daniel Marino, who became Bayou's chief financial officer. 
 As Bayou was nearing collapse, Mr. Marino wrote a suicide note. He never acted on it, and authorities recovered it last month. In that six-page letter, he described how the hedge fund had collapsed after years of unsuccessfully trying to recoup hidden losses. 
 Mr. Israel and Mr. Marino met at a small investment firm in New York called HMR Investors, where Mr. Israel, the documents say, was responsible for short-term trading. Mr. Marino, a former accountant, was HMR's chief financial officer. 
 But the stint at HMR, which coincides with his work at Gerard Klauer Mattison, doesn't appear in the career history that Mr. Israel provided to regulators. 
 So he was moonlighting.
 In any case, in April 1991, Mr. Israel joined JGM Management, a hedge fund run by James Marquez, formerly a trader at Soros Asset Management and Steinhardt Management, two giants of the hedge fund industry. 
 After a year at JGM, Mr. Israel was on the move again, his C.R.D. said. Concorde Asset Management in Purchase, N.Y., near where he lived, was his next stop. That enterprise lasted six months.
 In January 1993, Mr. Israel got his big break: a job at Omega Advisors, a huge hedge fund run by Leon Cooperman. 
 Prospective Bayou investors were told that Mr. Israel stayed at Omega for four years and rose to the position of ''head trader'' at the firm. ''Mr. Israel was responsible for all equity and financial futures executions,'' the sales materials stated, ''as well as sharing responsibility for hedging the portfolio through the use of futures and options.'' 
 But an Omega official said that Mr. Israel's position at Omega was an administrative one, not a high-level trading job. And Mr. Israel's C.R.D. has him at Omega for only 18 months, not four years.
 Details, details. 
 In June 1995, Mr. Israel hit the road again, leaving Omega to start Bayou, according to his C.R.D. Investors were told, however, that his fund didn't open until 1997. 
 The reason for this discrepancy is not clear. But according to several investors, Mr. Israel opened Bayou for business in 1996. While the fund's performance started out well, it soon went sour, these investors said. 
 Losses are tough to own up to. And if Mr. Marino's note and federal prosecutors' contentions are true, Mr. Israel has had problems facing them for a long, long time.


GRAPHIC: Chart: ''Questionable Bio''The biography of Samuel Israel III in a Bayou Management marketing report in March 2003 contained much false information and exaggeration.Key PersonnelActually founded in 1995 and lost money in 1996, so he may have wanted to eliminate the year.Much of that time was spent at trading desks, not hedge funds.He was at Omega from January 1993 to June 1995 and was not head trader.He was responsible for some, not all, equity and financial futures executions.HMR is not on his career history filed with regulators.He was at Gruntal, but doesn't mention that it was only from May 1990 to March 1991.(pg. 6)

HEADLINE: Will Katrina Make the Fed Slow Down? 

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
WITH few economic reports due this week, the Federal Reserve has the stage pretty much to itself. But even if the calendar were full, it would be hard to deflect traders' attention from the first formal opportunity to gauge the Fed's thinking on interest rates and the economy since Hurricane Katrina.
 Stocks have rallied since the hurricane, at least partly in the hope that the Fed's rate-setting panel will end its streak of 10 consecutive quarter-point rate increases when it meets on Tuesday. That is the expectation of Henry J. Herrmann, chief executive of Waddell & Reed, the asset management firm, but he does not think that the Fed will stand pat for long. 
''They'll find some reason to go on hold and signal at the same time that the economy is continuing to do well and that just because they are passing this time doesn't mean they won't raise rates again,'' he said.
 Ultimately, he said, repairing the damage caused by Katrina is likely to result in a new growth spurt.
 ''Based on everything I'm hearing about the government programs that are going to be put in place to restart New Orleans, you could make the argument that the economy is going to be hurt in the short term,'' Mr. Herrmann said, ''but a reasonable person would conclude that there is then going to be an acceleration'' in growth.
 As is often the case when the Fed's policy makers announce their rate decisions, the accompanying statement is likely to carry more weight than the decision itself. If the Fed holds steady and hints that further increases are not necessarily in store, stock prices could benefit, Mr. Herrmann said.
 ''If they pause, I think the wording will be important,'' he said. ''If they don't signal that they are pausing now but probably raising rates again in the future, the market will rally pretty strongly.''
 Whatever move the Fed makes is likely to be guided by political considerations as well as economic factors, he added.
 ''The hurricane is going to have a detrimental effect on consumption for a while, and the economy was already slowing a bit,'' he said. ''With those two threats, the Fed tightening credit will be seen as an additional punishment after the blow dealt by the hurricane.''

DATA WATCH -- Reports on housing starts and building permits will be appetizers on the menu Tuesday before the Fed serves up the main course. Both are expected to have slipped in August, according to a poll of economists by Bloomberg News.
 A decline is also foreseen in the index of leading economic indicators. That report, to be issued Thursday, is expected to show a 0.3 percent decline for August after a gain of 0.1 percent for July.

HEADLINE: A Commoner's Rowdy Ride To the White House

BYLINE: By Roger Lowenstein

 BODY:
A BIOGRAPHER of Benjamin Franklin and Theodore Roosevelt, H.W. Brands has shifted his lens westward to tell the life of Andrew Jackson. His subject is well chosen -- a president generally ranked as significant yet one whose story is not widely known. 
 A generation younger than the signers of the Declaration of Independence, Jackson showed gallantry as a scout during the Revolution but had little else in common with the founding fathers. He had no money, no background, no family. Unlike Adams, he was not intellectual, and unlike Jefferson, he was seemingly not introspective. He wrote no memoirs, and while not unlettered, he broke the string of chief executives who were philosophical heirs to the Enlightenment. Reading the great writers seems to have occupied less of his time than fighting duels. And unlike his archrival, John Quincy Adams, whose father was a president, Jackson's father, an Irish immigrant, died before his birth. 
By the age of 14, the future president had also lost his mother and both his brothers, and witnessed the burning of his home by British troops. With the memory of his mother his ''only capital,'' he headed west from South Carolina to the Tennessee territory and made his name as an Indian fighter and self-styled conquistador against various European powers that would continue, even decades after Yorktown, to treat the interior of North America like a colonial chess board. As a general, he invaded Spanish Florida; as president, he emboldened Texans to rebel against Mexico. His most glorious moment occurred at the end of the War of 1812, when he saved New Orleans -- a prize sought for the very waters that have recently wreaked its destruction -- from the British.
 Though Jackson played an important role in advancing the frontier of white American settlement, as president (1829 to 1837) he occupied a quiet zone in American history -- after the bitter struggles over Federalism but just before the country came to be consumed by the issue of slavery. The dearth of a memorable issue during his White House years helps explain his relative obscurity.
 While the recent vogue for all things 1776 has turned the powdered wigs and lace blouses of the East Coast gentry into familiar images, ''Andrew Jackson: His Life and Times'' (Doubleday) is set in the country's far-less-genteel interior. This lends a freshness to the story, which is absorbing on its merit. Guns go off, it seems, on every page; even when serving as a roving judge, the young Jackson interrupts a trial to apprehend a rowdy at pistol point.
 Though he was his state's first congressman, he was bored by the legislative process and abruptly quit the Senate to pursue his goal as head of the Tennessee militia. Given that Indian threats preoccupied his neighbors, that was where opportunity and power lay. Moreover, though American rule was a settled question in Philadelphia, it was anything but in Nashville, where the British, and occasionally the Spanish, were jostling for power and plotting with various Indian tribes to break America off at the Mississippi River. It is thus a panoramic tale, peopled by a cast from Sam Houston and Davy Crockett to Tecumseh and, improbably, Aaron Burr. 
 Always, geography was determinative of Jackson's politics. Mr. Brands reminds us that in the early 19th century, the central divide in America was still between East and West, not North and South. While the federal government struck treaties that ceded land to Native Americans, Jackson was more interested in security and territory for the ever-increasing white population. The first commoner to reach the White House, Jackson was essentially elected as a democratizer to complete the Revolution begun by Virginia planters. Unfortunately, even as president, he was unable to outgrow his Westernism. He declined to enforce a Supreme Court decision defending the rights of Cherokees to remain in Georgia. And despite -- or perhaps because of -- his limited knowledge of economics, Jackson sought to destroy the Second Bank of the United States, setting off a war with the bank president and ultimately a national financial panic.
 Mr. Brands tends to be indulgent toward his subject's shortcomings, which included his acceptance of the plantation economy (Jackson both traded and owned slaves) and his frequent usurpations of civil law. The author accepts the claim that Jackson had the Indians' ''best interests'' at heart despite much -- often bloody -- evidence to the contrary, and he hesitates to censure Old Hickory's attack on the bank, concluding weakly that ''in matters monetary, there were no easy answers.'' 
 Jackson's ability to inspire troops, his fortitude and his courage cannot be disputed, nor can his popularity with ordinary citizens. It is fair to say that he synthesized his frontier background and hatred of British royalty into a more democratic style than that of his predecessors. But as Mr. Brands concedes, it was an emotional synthesis, not truly thought out. Despite his devotion to the Union, Jackson never accepted the primacy of the Supreme Court over the legislative and executive branches, exposing an intellectual shallowness. His biographer makes the case for Jackson as a tribune of ''the people,'' a predecessor of Lincoln, but a case that Jackson was a dangerous demagogue, a general-turned-president with Napoleonic leanings, could be made as well.

HEADLINE: The Disaster Behind the Disaster: Poverty

BYLINE: By DANIEL ALTMAN

 BODY:
IN the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, people watching images of poverty along the Gulf Coast may have wondered, ''How many poor places like this are there in this country?'' The easy answer is, quite a few. 
 But why poverty persists in certain areas is a complex problem, and what can be done to help isn't always clear.
The Census Bureau defines poverty using a formula based on a family's age profile and its ability to buy a standard basket of necessities. Prices differ across regions, meaning that a family just above the poverty line and living in, say, San Diego may have a harder time making ends meet than one that is just below that line and living in Pascagoula, Miss. Also, not everyone who is poor at one point in a year is poor for the whole year. 
 Accepting the Census Bureau's measure, there were about 37 million poor people in the United States last year -- about one of every eight Americans. The share is only slightly higher in rural areas than in urban areas, according to the Agriculture Department, and these figures have been converging over time.
 Poverty tends to be concentrated in certain places, some of which, like Appalachia, are very large; others are no bigger than a few city blocks. To fight poverty, one has to understand its source. Were these places always poor? Did they become collecting bowls for poor people? Or do they make people poor? 
 ''The answer is all of the above,'' said Rebecca M. Blank, dean of the Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan. Some regions, like Appalachia, have been poor for so long because of well-known historical and geographical factors, she said. Some cities, too, have been victims of long-term trends, like the decline in manufacturing in the Midwest.
 In rural areas, the most persistent poverty -- above 20 percent of the population for the last four censuses, dating back to 1970 -- has been concentrated in a few swaths of the country. The largest section stretches in two directions -- from northwestern Louisiana, up the Mississippi and east to North Carolina. The other concentrations are in central Alaska, around the Four Corners area of the Southwest, in southern Texas along the Mexican border, and in the heart of the Appalachians in eastern Kentucky. 
 Appalachia's problems are well documented. The region isn't flat enough to make farming very profitable, especially when competing with the Plains states, and it's too far from big cities to easily attract businesses. 
 In the face of such persistent poverty, people often move to seek their fortunes elsewhere -- most often in cities. Cities that have jobs to offer can become magnets for the poor, who move in from around the country or around the world, Professor Blank said. 
 But when cities lose jobs, large portions of their populations can quickly slip into indigence. Detroit, El Paso, Miami and Newark were the biggest centers for urban poverty in 2004. More than 28 percent of their populations lived in poverty -- more than twice the national rate. Orleans Parish of Louisiana came in at 23 percent that year. 
 While upswings in the economic cycle may reduce poverty as a whole, pockets in some urban neighborhoods have been intractable. ''We've got answers in the margins, but I can't say anyone has absolutely solved that problem,'' Professor Blank said. Persuading businesses to operate in poor areas isn't easy, especially when the local populations lack education and skills. And it's hard for people to gain education and skills when there are no jobs. It's a Catch-22.
 The situation is similar in rural areas. The people most likely to leave are those for whom the payoff is biggest. When the most highly skilled workers migrate to the cities, rural poverty deepens. 
 The question is: Should the government try to improve conditions in persistently poor areas, or should it simply wait for -- or even encourage -- the population to move away? 
 ''The notion that you're going to move out huge numbers of people easily is just absurd,'' said David T. Ellwood, dean of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. ''Instead, what you can do is do your best to try and improve the opportunities for people to move up and move out.''
 Improving education is one way to provide those opportunities, Professor Ellwood said. Beyond that, different strategies can come into play for urban and rural areas. In cities, the way forward may be to match neighborhoods with businesses for which an urban location is a plus, he said, and then to add industry-specific training programs to give local workers the necessary skills.
 In rural areas, the savior could be the changing labor market. With growth in the core labor force flattening out in the next couple of decades, and communications technology radically improving, pools of unused workers in remote places could become hot properties, Professor Ellwood predicted.
 ''The question is, can you find a set of activities where having a ready source of labor, where labor costs aren't very high and there's a real opportunity to do some industry-specific training that can make the area work?'' he asked. With time, he said, ''there's a very reasonable chance that some of these areas will begin to look like some of the formerly poor areas in the South that are now booming.''
 That may not offer consolation to people who are poor or hungry now. But there are too many potential solutions to give up on poor areas.

HEADLINE: Pop Goes the Bubble? Maybe It's Time to Cheer

BYLINE: By DANIEL AKST. 
Daniel Akst is a journalist and novelist who writes often about business. E-mail: culmoney@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
IT'S funny how much comfort people can derive from something as transparent as a bubble. 
 Now that home prices in some markets are showing signs of moderating, lamentations are rising from all sides about the many bad things that may happen as a result. These include bankruptcies, foreclosures, bank failures, unemployment and recession.
Unfortunately, all of this hand-wringing tends to distract from the essential truth about soaring home prices, which is that they are a bad thing. So before you become carried away with mourning, let me break the news: the housing bubble never loved you. The bubble is not even your friend. In fact, the very best thing you can say about the passing of this particular bubble is ''good riddance.'' 
 What's so bad about skyrocketing home prices? Almost everything. First, they make life awfully difficult for people who aren't already homeowners and do little for people who are, because selling one inflated house only to buy another affords little profit. 
 It's true that mounting home equity makes for a nice piggy bank, but it probably also suppresses other kinds of saving and encourages excessive debt. And it has helped addict global producers to American consumerism, because it gives Americans the confidence -- and in many cases the wherewithal -- to spend some of the inflated value of their homes. But bubbles aren't very durable. Wouldn't it be better if Asian and European domestic demand could pick up some of the slack?
 Sky-high home prices also divert too much capital into home building from potentially more productive uses. And these prices fuel risky, not especially useful speculation in residential real estate. Then there is the matter of sprawl: all those new homes will mean more driving, more fossil-fuel consumption and more pollution. 
 Excessive home prices divert human capital as well. The National Association of Realtors had 1.1 million members at the end of 2004, up from 766,560 in 2000. It's hard to believe that such an increase would have occurred if there had been no housing bubble.
 Finally, wouldn't it be better for society, and safer for our financial system, if people could buy a home without resorting to the kinds of loans -- with deferred amortization, for example, or scant down payments -- that are risky for borrowers and lenders alike? Al Mansell, president of the Realtors' association, noted recently that the median down payment by first-time home buyers was just 3 percent, down from 10 percent in the early 1980's. He added that a quarter of first-time buyers who did make down payments used gifts from their parents. But more than 4 out of 10 put down no money at all.
 High home prices may contribute to social and economic inequality by making far too many places out of reach for anyone but the rich, and by making it nearly impossible for people without enormous incomes to afford homes in places with the kind of desirable school systems that can help put children onto a higher earnings trajectory.
 But if inflated home prices are bad, isn't the end of a housing bubble worse? Not necessarily. There is always pain associated with market adjustments. But as the economist Herbert Stein once dryly observed, if something cannot go on, it will stop. The Federal Reserve, through its monetary policy of low interest rates, has propped up real estate prices for years. Other government policies, from zoning to building codes, are doing likewise. Even Hurricane Katrina may play a role; by diverting huge amounts of construction material to New Orleans and the Gulf Coast, it could drive up the costs of new homes across the country. 
 My sense, though, is that home prices appear determined to fall, at least where they are most inflated. And having them fall sooner imposes lower costs than having them fall later, while delivering immediate benefits. 
 If prices moderate, maybe we won't gobble up open space as quickly. Lower prices will clearly deter some speculators, who will put their money to work elsewhere. And some of those real estate brokers will find something else useful to do. Best of all, people at dinner parties and soccer games will have to find something more interesting to talk about. 
 That alone makes the end of the housing bubble a good excuse to break out the Champagne.
