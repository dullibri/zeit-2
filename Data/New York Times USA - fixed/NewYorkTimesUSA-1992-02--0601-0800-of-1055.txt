HEADLINE: The 1992 Campaign: Media;
TV Viewers Get to See the Candidates, and See the Candidates

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Feb. 15

 BODY:
For anyone who still wants to get to know the Presidential candidates, these are happy days to be a television viewer. The candidates are showing their inner selves. They are looking haggard on the news. They are turning mean in their advertising. They are personally pre-empting entire programs.
At 9 o'clock Friday evening, for instance, viewers expecting the situation comedy "Baby Talk" were instead offered Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas and a toll-free number for asking him questions. Not being seasoned political journalists, most viewers did not realize that the only important question this election is Mr. Clinton's 1969 draft deferment, so they got sidetracked on other issues, but there were valuable lessons nonetheless. 
 "I'm very interested in trains," one potential voter said. "I'd like to be able to take a train from Portsmouth to Boston. You know, I'd like to commute. Are you going to do anything about trains?"
"I am," Mr. Clinton replied, but before he spelled out his high-speed-rail program he made a confession. "I can't promise you a route from Portsmouth to Boston because I don't know enough about the economics of that." He smiled sheepishly and shrugged. "Perhaps I should, but I don't."
 
Candidate With a Plan
 Yes, he was apologizing for not knowing offhand the projected ridership of the Portsmouth-Boston rail corridor, and that says quite a lot about who Mr. Clinton is: the candidate with an earnest smile, a statistic and a plan for just about every other question facing himself or America.
When he is in good television form, it is tempting to disregard all the political obituaries for him in the national press, and the last couple of days he has had his moments again: hugging a weeping woman on the evening news, sincerely talking to the camera on his commercials, intelligently handling question after question on his 30-minute live commercials.
But then there have been the awkward moments when he is seen facing reporters determined to know why he did not fight in Vietnam. It is difficult to say who comes off worse: the righteous reporters, most of whom do not look like veterans of the Tet offensive, or Mr. Clinton, whose poised answers start to look suspiciously pat.
"He seems like a Barbie doll to me," one caller complained on Boston's WRKO radio, and on late-night television they keep saying much worse things. On Friday, as Los Angeles braced for more flooding rains, Johnny Carson told his audience, "We need another storm like Bill Clinton needs another revelation." He expressed doubts that Mr. Clinton's unraveling campaign could be saved by the new slogan, "Clinton: He never robbed a liquor store."
 
Going for the Media Gusto
 The other candidates are not quite this mean to Mr. Clinton, although Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa has come close. Lately he has done some advertising to soften his image, like a half-hour commercial Friday that pre-empted "Entertainment Tonight" and featured him chatting with a woman who asked questions like, "I'd like to know a little more about Tom Harkin the man." But he is still the candidate most willing to go for media gusto.
He looked most at home in front of a foreclosed home -- a favorite photo scene for everyone this campaign -- as he shook his fist and proclaimed, "I just want to grab Bush and shake him, you know, grab him and shake him a couple of times, and see if I get some sense into that skull of his."
Mr. Harkin appeared this week on the news in front of a nuclear power plant as he lambasted former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts for supporting nuclear power. He was quick to speak out about Mr. Clinton's character problems. And he lumped both men with Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska in a commercial that began the negative advertisement war on television this week. It showed their photos as the announcer intoned, "These three Democrats are all saying the same thing: more tax cuts for the rich and big business."
 
Projecting Nicer Image
 Mr. Kerrey retaliated on Friday with an advertisement denying that he supports tax breaks for the rich. Mr. Kerrey's advertisement said he supports tax cuts for the middle class, which are opposed by Mr. Harkin, and the announcer sums up Mr. Harkin this way, "Old style Democrat, old-style negative campaign."
Mr. Kerrey's other negative advertisements have been a little more subtle, criticizing his rivals without naming them. One advertisement stresses the importance of choosing someone capable of beating President Bush and points out certain qualities of Mr. Kerrey's, like his military record: "No one can question his patriotism."
In other ways, though, Mr. Kerrey has recently been projecting a nicer image. On the news he has refrained from commenting about Mr. Clinton's Vietnam problem. A new advertisement shows him sitting in a living room, smiling slightly and speaking in much gentler tones than in the previous commercials that stressed his toughness.
Mr. Tsongas' commercials still show him doing everything but talking; that is left to an announcer with good diction. And he still spends a lot of television time in the pool, both in his commercials and on the evening news. Last week dozens of reporters were on hand for his daily swim, which has become his visual answer to questions about his recovery from cancer.
The face of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York has become familiar in New Hampshire, thanks partly to the news coverage of his speech at Harvard University on Wednesday, but mainly to the television commercials urging voters to write in his name. One half of the screen shows Mr. Cuomo speaking -- "We are going absolutely down the wrong road" -- while the other half shows his name being written.
 
Bush, Flag and War
 President Bush's advertisements are broadcast constantly, but for some reason they seem the easiest to ignore. Perhaps this is because they look like so many other images of Mr. Bush over the last four years, or because the strategy behind the commercials seems so blatantly manipulative: combine Mr. Bush, the flag, stirring music, the Oval Office and fighter planes from the Persian Gulf war.
Or perhaps it is because of the commercials of Patrick J. Buchanan, who may have pioneered a new form of negative campaigning: consciousness alteration through saturation advertising.
Mr. Buchanan has some advertisements showing himself speaking somberly to the camera about America's future, but his most memorable commercials continue to be ones featuring Mr. Bush's 1988 pledge: "Read my lips. No new taxes." The advertisements have been on so often for so long that a curious effect has occurred. The advertisement at first seems hard-hitting, then tiresome, then reason to lunge for the mute button.
But then at some point, maybe around the 50th showing, for some viewers the sound bite begins to acquire a surreal fascination, as if it is disclosing something deep inside Mr. Bush. As he jabs his finger into the air and screeches the words again and again, with each commercial he begins to seem more and more desperate, more and more absurd. For these dedicated television viewers, it has been difficult to take the President seriously ever since.

HEADLINE: Not a Grandma Moses Picture: Poker in the Woods

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LEDYARD, Conn., Feb. 15

 BODY:
The Connecticut countryside was covered with frost today when the first early bird appeared at the doors of the Foxwoods High Stakes Bingo and Casino at 6 A.M. for the state's first day of legal casino gambling.
By the time a loud cheer went up four hours later, as the gaming floor finally opened and thousands of people swarmed toward the blackjack, roulette, craps and poker tables, more than the frost had disappeared from the landscape. 
 Here in a casino built by an Indian tribe, the Mashantucket Pequots, a casino in the woods with the soft ambiance of an expensive suburban mall, a world away from the hard glitz of Atlantic City, the crowds coming in to look and to play could imagine only one future: more casinos, everywhere.
"How can the state go on and not make money on these things?" said Roger Henry of Hampton, Conn., referring to the singular fact that Connecticut, hard-pressed financially, will not receive a dollar from all the chips bet here, because Foxwoods is on a federally recognized Indian reservation.
"They're going to get their foot in somewhere," Mr. Henry predicted. "When you look at the fiscal state of this state, how bad shape they're in, they're going to grab every buck they can."
 
A Different Tone
 Today Foxwoods opened as the first legal casino on the East Coast outside Atlantic City, and the circumstances of its birth could hardly be more different from the spirit of almost puritanical distrust that set Atlantic City apart when New Jersey legalized casinos for it, and it alone, in 1976
Atlantic City is where Guy A. Potolicchio, a police officer from Stamford, Conn., has gone every few months to gamble. This morning he came to Foxwoods, and just after noon was knocking off for the day, having built a $200 stake into $1,200 at blackjack.
A Connecticut native, he never imagined his home state would have a casino, he said, but now he expects more casinos and probably slot machines. "It's a new source of revenue," he said.
Compared to Atlantic City, Mr. Potolicchio said, Foxwoods "is a shorter drive and a more pleasant drive. But when you win, any drive is pleasant."
Where Atlantic City's gambling industry was born of a state referendum, justified in public policy terms by the need to revive the city and raise new revenue for the state, Foxwoods is a vision of a small but sovereign Indian tribe, authorized by Federal law to offer any kind of gambling that Con necticut already allows.
The irony is not lost on members of the clergy, mental health professionals and others concerned about the human costs of organized gambling: Connecticut has a casino now not because it wanted one, but because gambling was already pervasive, legalized in lotteries, betting on horse racing and dog racing, jai alai, and church bingo and Las Vegas nights.
What Connecticut, and so Foxwoods, do not have, is slot machines, but that too may change as the state seeks not only new sources of revenue but also some way to blunt the Pequots' drain on the state's gambling dollars.
In this grim budget season, legislators in Hartford are talking about licensing more casinos, selling $10 lottery tickets and putting slot machines in off-track betting parlors. As a last resort, one legislator has proposed putting a $5 toll on the section of Route 2 that leads into the Pequot reservation here.
"They're going to take away from the horse racing, the dog racing, the jai alai," Vincent Finelli, of North Smithfield, R.I., said of the Pequots, predicting that states will have to join them and other New England tribes like Rhode Island's Naragansetts in opening casinos. "Gambling is here to stay, and there's nothing you can do about it."
Proponents of gambling in Connecticut cite other states that have approved casinos: South Dakota, Colorado and Iowa have all allowed it in limited ways.
Set in a corner of Ledyard, miles from the town's two-stop-light center, Foxwoods at first sight appears to be a new shopping center, with grading equipment still parked on the edges of its freshly paved parking lots.
Inside, the atmosphere is soft and understated, accented with Indian patterns and designs that lead the eye to the casino's most unusual feature, windows that open upon the wooded hills of southeastern Connecticut. In this casino, at the Pequots' insistence, the players will know night from day.
Despite the tribe's efforts to maintain harmony between their land and their business, Foxwoods is still a casino. Cash machines near the entrance stand next to a display of Indian pottery. At 9 A.M. the bar behind the waterfall that dominates the center atrium was crowded with people drinking beer, waiting for the 10 A.M. opening. The fringed tunics worn by cocktail waitresses are slashed to the hip.
When security men in green blazers stepped aside and let players onto the floor, craps and roulette tables were ringed immediately, and lines formed at the video slot machines along one wall which neither take money nor pay money while they await the state's blessing.
By 10:15, 13 tables were playing poker, a game that Atlantic City does not have. By 10:30 the bar and a buffet restaurant, crowded at 10, were empty. All over the casino the crowd noise was punctuated by the clicking of the chips, like crickets on a summer's day.
By 12:15 the 1,730-space parking lot was full, and by 3 P.M. the police were towing cars parked along the two-lane country road leading to the casino.
 
The Money Is Real
 Many of the casinos' 2,300 employees worked almost through the night Friday to prepare for the opening, as play money used for three nights of practice play -- two of them dedicated as charity benefits -- was exchanged for real money, and tables were stocked with chips.
The casino's president, Alfred J. Luciani, a non-Pequot with experience in Atlantic City and Las Vegas, estimated that 2,500 people had come in the first hour and that 15,000 would pass through by the end of the day.
"Today is not a day for serious gamblers," Mr. Luciani said of the opening crowd. "A lot of people are here just for entertainment -- which we want them here for."
The casino, if it chooses, can operate 24 hours a day, though Connecticut liquor laws do not allow it to serve alcohol between 1 and 9 A.M. during the week and 2 and 9 A.M. Saturdays and Sundays.
"Once this apparation is out of the way," Mr. Luciani said of the opening, "we'll see what the public wants and adjust our hours accordingly."
Foxwoods has the freedom to adjust hours and quickly to make other business decisions like opening or closing gaming tables because its business activities are regulated not by the state but by the Mashantucket Pequot Gaming Commission, which has its offices right here.
That freedom, Mr. Luciani said, sets the Pequots' casino apart from those of Atlantic City. But it is also symbolic to some people of how freely gambling has grown.
This week members of the clergy from southeastern Connecticut warned that there would be human casualties from the casino, because of compulsive gambling and the illegal activities that gambling centers can attract, and called on Foxwoods to contribute to the cost of helping those.
But their warning was carefully measured, in part because church bingo nights opened the door for Foxwoods.
"The clergy are in no way critical of the Mashantucket Pequots for the establishment of the casino," the Rev. Christopher J. Emerson of the Mystic Congregational Church said Friday. "The tribal council has simply taken fair advantage of the gaming environment in the state of Connecticut and has chosen to play the game as it's laid.
"We're concerned about the growing dependence of the state on gambling revenues," he continued, "but we are hardly critical of the Pequots for wanting a piece of the action."

HEADLINE: Cuomo Puts Off Medicaid Cut After Pleas From Pharmacists

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
Pharmacists across New York State envisoned economic disaster for their businesses, and Medicaid patients expressed deep misgivings for their health yesterday, as the state went to the brink of a long-planned cut in Medicaid payments for prescription drugs -- then postponed action for a few days.
Under intense pressure from pharmacy trade groups as a midnight deadline approached, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo late Friday night put off a 10 percent cut in the state's $550 million program of reimbursing pharmacies for the prescription drugs they dispense to 2.5 million poor people covered by Medicaid. 
 "The change will be implemented -- it's just a question of when," Terry Lynam, a spokesman for the Governor, said. He said the Governor had acted to allow more time for talks between the state and representatives of 3,700 pharmacies, which filled 25 million prescriptions under Medicaid last year.
Jerome Sager, general counsel and executive director of the Empire State Pharmaceutical Society, representing 1,000 stores, said pharmacists wanted the cut limited to 5 percent, and other concessions, including a rise in dispensing fees for each prescription to $4.05 from $2.60 and the use of monthly rather than semiannual wholesale price surveys to set reimbursement rates.
 
Excessive Profits Suspected
 State officials say they must make the cuts under Federal regulations aimed at controlling soaring medical costs, and because $1.1 billion must be trimmed from Medicaid in this year's state budget. Federal and state surveys have suggested that some pharmacies, by buying drugs at discounts from wholesale prices, made excessive profits on Medicaid.
But trade groups representing the pharmacies vehemently deny this. Noting that pharmacies have had no increase in Medicaid drug-reimbursements for 14 years, despite soaring drug costs, they contend that the cuts would be devastating, especially to small independent stores.
Moreover, if the cuts are imposed, some pharmacies say they might stop serving Medicaid patients or handling the most expensive prescriptions, many of them used to fight cancer or the virus that causes AIDS, and they have suggested that one of the first things to be canceled would be free deliveries to homebound elderly patients.
While the postponement was expected to last only a few days, it drew some expressions of relief. "Thank God they stopped this thing," Jerry Ginsberg, a pharmacist and part-owner of C. O. Bigelow Chemists in Greenwich Village, said. "We were planning to give customers a last refill, but we weren't going to fill any new prescriptions."
 
'People Will Be Devastated'
 An elderly woman named Margaret, who wanted a Medicaid prescription filled, was taken aback by the possibility that C. O. Bigelow might not be able to serve her in the future. "It's ghastly," she said. "People will be devastated. Heart medication, hypertension drugs -- all these medications are essential."
The State Department of Social Services, which administers the reimbursement program, contends that the cuts will not seriously harm most pharmacies, and it has set up a phone line -- (800) 541-2831 -- to tell Medicaid patients where to find the nearest pharmacy that will fill their prescriptions.
In Rochester, Robert G. Single, the owner of Culver Pharmacy, said that if the cuts take effect, it will be hard to stay in business, let alone offer free delivery. At the Saratoga Pharmacy across town, Charles Robertson noted that 80 percent of his business was filling Medicaid prescriptions.
"This is going to have a big impact on the little guy, the independent," Mr. Robertson said. "It is very hard to compete with the chains. We can't buy in bulk quantities. We are one store." And, referring to the state, he said: "They are trying to use us to decrease their budget."
 
Posing Moral Quandary
 In Harlem, Victor LaPerla, co-owner of Better Buy Pharmacy, said his store would refuse to fill more than half its Medicaid prescriptions if the cuts were imposed, but he noted that refusing service to a customer who had been coming in for years would pose a moral quandry.
"It's not illegal to refuse the prescription," he said. "If you're not making a profit, you don't have to sell. Legally, you're covered. Morally? It's your conscience. I don't want to see anybody drop dead. A lot of our customers are very, very concerned, especially the elderly."
A customer at the Harlem store, Capus Teague, a 57-year-old retired printer who depends on Medicaid for drugs and treatment for his emphysema and diabetes, said he was angry about the possible cuts. "It's all messed up, the whole system from the Government down through the drug stores," he said. "And we're the ones who have to suffer."
Under the Medicaid program of assistance for poor people, the state has paid pharmacies since 1978 for the prescriptions they dispense under a complex formula based on the average wholesale price of each drug, plus $2.60 as a dispensing fee for each prescription.
 
U.S. Ordered Cut in 1987
 In 1987, the Federal Government wrote new rules to control health costs, and directed states to cut 10 percent from their reimbursement rates if they wanted to continue receiving Federal aid for Medicaid, which provides 50 percent of the program's money. Lawsuits by pharmacies and their trade groups kept New York State from imposing the cuts immediately.
The state offered to settle by increasing the dispensing fees to $3.90 a prescription, but the pharmacies refused. Rulings in Federal Court in Manhattan in December and January finally resolved the suits, largely in the state's favor, and cleared the way for the state to impose the 10 percent cuts at 12:01 A.M. yesterday.
As the deadline approached, pharmacy trade groups warned in advertisements and fliers about a looming crisis, lobbied in Albany and urged Governor Cuomo to postpone action pending further talks. The Governor agreed after legislative leaders also asked for a delay to discuss the prescription-drug issue as part of larger budget talks aimed at cutting Medicaid by $1.1 billion.

HEADLINE: Woman Uses Wealth to Ease Maine's Bank Woes

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Me., Feb. 15

 BODY:
After two banks in this state closed last year, a 61-year-old woman who has adopted Maine as her home decided to do something to help reverse that trend. She opened a bank: the Maine Bank & Trust Company.
With a fortune estimated at $100 million, most of it invested in a computer company, Elizabeth B. Noyce can afford to furnish the capital for a bank. She invested almost $7 million to start Maine Bank & Trust, which opened here on Nov. 20. 
 On the first day, customers seeking to open accounts steadily filed into the bank, a 10-story marble building near the cobblestone streets of the Old Port district.
The president, Wayne C. McGarvey, said the bank had done well in its first three months. "In six weeks," he said, "we more than doubled our assets to $14 million." Since then, he added, the bank's assets have continued to grow rapidly.
 
Glimmer of Sunshine
 Donald Groves, deputy superintendent of the Maine Bureau of Banking, described the bank as "one of the few glimmers of sunshine in an otherwise gloomy economy."
In an interview, Mrs. Noyce, who holds 90 percent of the stock in the bank, said she was not concerned about making a profit. Nor did she want to be involved in the bank's daily operations, she said.
"The fact is I have disposable income," she said. "I want the bank to be successful. But the truth is I don't have to worry about decent returns on my investment."
Her lawyer, however, said Mrs. Noyce is worried about Maine's economy. "Given the terrible economic situation in Maine, Betty was looking for an investment that would demonstrate confidence in the future of Maine," said the lawyer, Owen Wells.
Mrs. Noyce received half of her husband's fortune when they were divorced in 1974. Her husband, Robert N. Noyce, who died a year ago, founded Intel Corporation and was the co-inventor of the integrated circuit chip, the basis for the modern computer.
Mrs. Noyce had spent summers in Maine, and after the divorce she moved to Bremen, a fishing village of 675 people on Muscongus Bay, about 65 miles northeast of Portland.
In the last decade Mrs. Noyce has given a total of $25 million, most of it in Intel stocks, to Maine hospitals, museums and dozens of other nonprofit organizations. She has given away more money than any other benefactor in the state's history, Mr. Wells said.
"I've always believed you do good by doing well," Mrs. Noyce said. "In the past, most of my charitable gifts were to institutions that benefited myself, my quality of life. But I've become more altruistic with age."
Mrs. Noyce, the youngest of four children, said she learned the value of sharing as a child growing up during the Depression in Auburn, Mass., a small town in the south-central part of the state, just south of Worcester.
 
'Modest Needs'
 While she now enjoys the freedom of having money to give away, Mrs. Noyce said, she also has "modest needs."
"I don't like a lot of frills," she said. "I don't like to travel. I'd much rather be home, raking the leaves and sawing off extra branches from spruce trees."
The opening of Maine Bank & Trust Company came after two major banks in the state closed. The first was the Portland-based Maine Savings Bank, which failed last February because of bad real estate loans. A few months later, Maine National Bank closed after its parent company, Boston's Bank of New England, also collapsed because of bad loans. Both were acquired by the Fleet/Norstar Financial Group Inc., a Rhode Island-based company. More than 1,000 jobs in Maine were eliminated as a result of the closures.
Mrs. Noyce said she was upset to see the banks close. "I knew the people who ran Maine National, so I knew it was a well-run bank," she said. "It was disconcerting to me to see it close. I believe that Maine residents deserve to have a Maine bank."
That feeling is reflected in the bank's motto: "A Maine Bank for Maine People."

HEADLINE: Catholic Schools in Danger of Closing

BYLINE: By ARI L. GOLDMAN

 BODY:
For days now, forlorn principals of Roman Catholic schools, accompanied by equally concerned pastors, parents and often the school accountant, have marched into the offices of John Cardinal O'Connor to argue for keeping their schools open.
Worried about rising deficits and low enrollments, the Cardinal has already decided to close one of the 304 schools in the Archdiocese of New York. In the next few days, his office is expected to announce the shuttering of others. 
 The Cardinal's office will not specify how many schools besides the one closed, St. Joseph's in Yonkers, are in jeopardy. One early rumor had it that 41 closings were under consideration. A later report said that no more than 15 would close. And no one is discounting the possibility of a last-minute rescue maneuver by the Cardinal.
But his actions have sent chills coursing through the schools of the archdiocese and focused new attention on their tenuous place in the city's educational network.
 
Too Many Deficits
 Part of the problem the parochial schools face results from a lack of the traditional middle-class support. Over the last generation many of the schools have moved from educating middle-class and working-class Irish and Italian Catholics to educating poor Hispanic Catholics and blacks, many of whom are Protestants.
With 110,000 students, the schools of the archdiocese are second in size in New York City to the public school system, with about 980,000 students. But the Catholic schools receive almost no government subsidies and rely on tuition and support from the local parish church.
All of the schools at risk of closing are in poor neighborhoods.
For several years, the deficits of dozens of such schools were covered by the archdiocese. But the archdiocese has said it can no longer carry the load.
"People are nervous because nobody knows what is going on," said Brian Coyle, the principal of St. Joseph's School on Bathgate Avenue in the Bronx.
 
'New York Has Held Out'
 A year ago, the Cardinal began an effort to raise $100 million over three years for the schools but he has fallen far short of his first-year goal.
In a recent column in Catholic New York, the weekly newspaper of the archdiocese, Cardinal O'Connor said he was focusing on 41 inner-city schools that "my close consultants tell me are 'at risk'. " Most have raised tuition as high as they can, he wrote, yet they face a deficit of over $4.5 million. "Where do I come up with money like that?" he asked.
Cardinal O'Connor's problems are not singular.
According to Sister Catherine T. McNamee, president of the National Catholic Educational Association in Washington, other major Catholic centers, such as Chicago and Boston, closed dozens of schools in the 1980's. "New York has held out longer," Sister McNamee said. "It has a major commitment to keeping the inner-city schools open.
While the commitment has been there, she said, the realities of tough economic times and the migration of Catholics away from the inner cities have caught up with the archdiocese.
 
Opportunities for Poor Children
 The Archdiocese of New York covers 1.8 million Catholics in Manhattan, the Bronx, Staten Island, Westchester and six other counties north of New York City. Brooklyn and Queens make up a separate diocese, the Diocese of Brooklyn, which has its own Catholic school system with 183 schools and 75,000 children.
The last large-scale closing of schools in Brooklyn was in 1973, when the diocese shut 10 schools. Since then, schools in the diocese have closed at the rate of one or two a year.
According to the National Catholic Educational Association, the New York Archdiocese closed 19 of its 331 schools between 1985 and 1990. During the same period, the Chicago Archdiocese closed 39 of its 416 schools and the Boston Archdiocese closed 33 of its 215 schools.
The Cardinal's fund-raising campaign began in January 1991, when he formed an interfaith committee headed by Frederic V. Salerno, president and chief operating officer of New York Telephone. The committee includes Alan C. Greenberg, chairman and chief executive officer of Bear Stearns Companies; K. Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News America Publishers Inc., and Thomas S. Murphy, chairman of Capital Cities/ABC Inc.
The campaign was aimed at raising money from the business and financial communities. Committee members argued that the Catholic schools were an important factor in the region's economy, offering opportunities for children in poor neighborhoods. The schools claim a 1 percent drop-out rate and say that 90 percent of graduates go on to college.
 
Pledges and Cash Low
 In the first year, however, the fund-raising effort, known as Partnership for Quality Education, raised only $23 million in pledges and received less than half that amount in cash. "Everybody I go to tells me, 'You've got this job in the worst possible time,' " said Bishop Patrick V. Ahern, the archdiocese's vicar for development. "The economy is not on our side."
At the same time, the need has grown. Eleven years ago the archdiocese had 79 schools classified as poor inner city schools; now there are 140.
Several of the schools summoned to the headquarters of the archdiocese -- including Mr. Coyle's St. Joseph's School in the Bronx -- were told a few days later that they could keep their doors open but had to face a future of reduced subsidies from the archdiocese.
At the school that is being closed, St. Joseph's in Yonkers, Nancy Langehennig, the principal, has been trying to reassure children and their parents that a place would be found in nearby Catholic schools for every one of the 127 youngsters now enrolled. She said she was satisfied that the archdiocese did all that it could to keep the school open.
"The decision was based on low enrollment and our inability to keep ourselves going financially," she said.
A school that had a near brush with closing was St. Jerome's at Alexander Avenue and 138th Street in the Bronx. After a meeting earlier this month with the Cardinal, the pastor, the Rev. John O. Grange, led his committee in an impromptu prayer. "St. Jerome pray for us," he said, "and pray for Cardinal O'Connor."
The level of anxiety was high the next day at the school, which is in a run-down but clean and cheery 120-year-old building in the South Bronx. "My little one cried all night," said a secretary who has two children in the school. " My children have never been to public school. They're scared of what goes on there."
The next day, the Cardinal's office told the school that it would be given another chance to get its financial house in order. Among other fund-raising efforts, Father Grange hopes to start Friday fasts, in which both parents and children would give up a favorite treat or luxury and donate the money to the school. The school's population is one with few luxuries, but the pastor is convinced that the sacrifices can make a difference.
"It's like a new life," Father Grange said of the reprieve. "Everybody is happy. We've got a lot of work to do but we think we can make it."

HEADLINE: We Need a Real National Rebuilding Program;
Consumer Confidence

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In testimony before the Senate Budget Committee on Feb. 4, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, expressed dismay that American consumers have not shown the confidence they showed in past recessions. Until consumer confidence is restored, the economy will continue to wallow in recession. 
 In 1983-85, private citizen Alan Greenspan continually expressed a fear that consumers were too exuberant. He noted that prosperity was being largely financed by consumer loans collateralized by the growing equity that American households had in their homes. Citizen Greenspan argued for an end to spending financed by growing home equities.
Consumer confidence, however, is closely related to the net worth of consumers. For 40 years, from 1946 to 1986, household net worth rose at an average 8 percent annual rate. Brashly confident American consumers continually spent us out of the mild recessions of earlier post World War II days as soon as the Federal Reserve eased monetary policy.
But in 1990, for the first time in two generations, the collapse of real estate values caused a decline in the net worth of American households. Land values ($3.7 trillion) and residential structures ($4.6 trillion) together account for more than half the country's net worth. A family home is the largest investment for most consumers. No wonder consumer confidence stays depressed -- even after 14 Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.
Aggravating the depressed market for houses is the desire of the Resolution Trust Corporation to avoid increasing President Bush's deficit while disposing of failed savings and loan institutions. Instead of holding vacant housing foreclosed by the failed savings and loans, the Resolution Trust continues to dump properties on a depressed real estate market, causing those Americans who still own their homes to worry about the equity that remains.
Today, central banker Greenspan is surprised that he cannot stimulate the American consumer to borrow and spend us out of recession despite interest rate reductions. Moreover, without strong and growing demand in the consumer goods market, investment in entrepreneurial capital is unlikely to be profitable, no matter how low interest rates are driven.
It is unfortunate that we leave economic policy decisions to economists such as Dr. Greenspan, who are renowned experts on economic number crunching, but who apparently are completely uneducated in human economic behavior.

HEADLINE: Campaign Trail Leads To New York for Cash

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER

 BODY:
In the last desperate days before the New Hampshire primary, as each candidate spins wildly from one quaint village to the next, often it is cocktails in Manhattan that is really on their minds.
"It's cash," said Stanley Greenberg, a poll taker for Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, who traveled with the candidate to a New York fund-raiser on Monday. "Everyone needs a lot of it, and a lot of it is here. After New Hampshire, the campaign goes on. But if you can't buy a plane ticket it's hard to get your message out." 
 So even in the busiest week of the campaign year so far, when every New Hampshire minute counts for every candidate, Governor Clinton and his wife found time to spend an evening in New York. So did Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, who showed up on Tuesday at the Regency Hotel, also with hat in hand. Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa was here the week before. And the new leader in the polls, Paul Tsongas, found time to attend six events in New York over the last two weeks. Hoping for a shower of celebrity if he wins in New Hampshire, Mr. Tsongas will return to the city the minute the primary ends.
 
The Money Crowd
 "I hate to sound like that song," said Jim Armenakis, the New York State chairman for the Tsongas campaign. "But if you can make it here, you can make it anywhere." That may or may not be true. But if you cannot make it in New York -- at least with the money crowd that campaigns need to prosper -- you certainly cannot make it in other places for long. New York and Los Angeles are the mother lodes for campaign fund-raising, but when you are unable to stray far from New Hampshire the money primary takes place mostly in New York.
And although a candidate has to win votes to become a nominee, the money primary is at least as important as any other aspect of the race. With more than $5 million in the bank, Governor Clinton has emerged as the only candidate with enough money to cruise -- at least financially -- out of New Hampshire. His opponents have reported surges in contributions over the last two weeks as polls showed Governor Clinton's campaign faltering, and they hope that a good showing this week, will turn the faucets on to full force.
Even the amount raised by the Clinton campaign, a treasure-trove by the standards of his competitors, could evaporate in a few weeks of bitter campaigning in expensive states like Texas or Florida. The steady need for cash has turned New York, and its wealthy investors, into hallowed ground.
The figures for January have not yet been reported to the Federal Election Commission, but by the end of December Governor Clinton had opened a huge financial lead on his competitors, having raised more than $3.2 million. Campaign officials said that by the end of January the figure had grown to more than $5 million -- almost twice as much as the $2.2 million reported in December by the next most successful fund-raiser, Senator Harkin.
Senator Kerrey had raised slightly less than $2 million, according to the F.E.C., and Mr. Tsongas barely more than $1 million. By comparison, Michael Dukakis had raised well over $10 million by this point in 1988, and President Bush has already reported contributions of more than $9 million for his re-election bid.
Nearly a third of campaign contributions comes from dinners, breakfasts, drinks and "house parties" in New York, political consultants say. The F.E.C. has not yet released detailed reports on where each candidate's contributions have come from, so it is difficult to assess trends, but the Clinton event at the Sheraton Center Hotel last week, raised nearly $700,000 for the struggling candidate, and Kerrey officials said they raised more than $200,000 on Tuesday at their smaller, more intimate affair.
"New York is the best possible place to do these things," said Norman Adler, a political consultant. "People are concentrated in a relatively small place. There are a lot of big players who can fork out $1,000 whether or not they have committed themselves to one candidate or not. And if you can raise a bunch of money in a single night, you look good on television. It's a little bit of substance and a lot of shimmering."
The recession has made money scarce this year. Wealthy real-estate developers are disappearing fast, and many seem uninterested in supporting Presidential candidates -- reserving their money instead for local leaders who may be better able to scratch their backs in return.
 
The Cuomo Factor
 As with every other factor in the race for the White House, the long, dark shadow of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has also had its effect.
"Of course he's been a factor," said Richard Socarides, the state chairman for the Harkin campaign. "If you are a New York contributor and you think he may run, it can cause you to think twice about giving to the others."
New York's role as electoral money depot does not please everybody. Many politicians view the constant round of fund-raisers as distractions from more traditional political commitments.
"This process stinks," said John Marino, the state Democratic chairman. "They are running all over New Hampshire all day long, and they get on a plane and race to New York for dinner to grovel for money. They hardly see a normal voter. They don't go to subway stops, they go to Wall Street."

HEADLINE: Budget Shift Stirs Fears for Landmarks Panel

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
Zero dollars. Zero employees.
Preservationists and planners in and out of New York City government were startled last week when City Hall presented those figures for the Landmarks Preservation Commission for the next fiscal year. 
 They had already warily greeted a proposal in January to shift some administrative tasks from the landmarks commission to the City Planning Department. That economy measure was developed without consulting either Laurie Beckelman, the chairwoman of the landmarks commission, or Planning Director Richard L. Schaffer.
And when the zeros appeared in the Mayor's Management Report last week, with the landmarks budget folded into the Planning Department's, suspicion grew that a more fundamental consolidation might be under way.
The issue is particularly sensitive because the landmarks commission won independent status only three years ago. Before that, it was part of the Parks and Recreation Department.
"I don't want landmarks to be subsumed or their mission to be diluted," said Councilwoman June M. Eisland, a Bronx Democrat who heads the Council's Land Use Committee.
Even Ms. Beckelman was at a loss to explain the bookkeeping. "I question how they can put our budget into that of another agency when we're a separate agency," she said Friday morning.
By Friday afternoon, Deputy Mayor Barbara J. Fife said the idea of merging the agencies' budgets "is no longer contemplated" and that the two commissions would "keep their independent units of appropriation."
"The implications, when you saw no dollars there, were of a very different nature than intended," Ms. Fife said.
She emphasized that the proposal involved only "housekeeping functions" and that there was "not the remotest" plan to place the policy-making powers of the landmarks panel under the planning agency.
Harvey Robins, director of the Mayor's Office of Operations, added, "We are not in any way intending to diminish the very important role the chair has in retaining control over policy and programs."
 
Touchy Bookkeeping Plan
 But the notion of having the Planning Department handle the landmarks commission's payroll, time sheets, supplies and vouchers remains a plan, although it has few supporters.
"I was worried that there was a total loss of independent landmark personnel," said Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan.
Councilman Stephen DiBrienza, a Brooklyn Democrat who heads the Council's landmarks subcommittee, said it appeared to be "a wholesale movement of the landmarks commission into city planning."
Christabel Gough, a private preservationist, asked: "Having lost its funding and having had its staff reassigned to another agency, will the commission really feel that it can retain control? Is this not a rather broad hint to forget about independence?"
Kent L. Barwick, the president of the Municipal Art Society and a former chairman of the landmarks commission, said, "It's one of those ideas that comes out of the minds of junior budgeteers at 11 o'clock on the night before the budget is due."
Ms. Messinger has proposed a separate office to handle administration for several small agencies like the landmarks commission, Board of Standards and Appeals and Department of Records and Information Services.
When told that city officials had dropped the idea of moving the landmarks budget, Ms. Messinger still expressed concern. "I think they're being put under the umbrella of an agency that has a different function," she said, "one that's sometimes at odds with the function of landmarks."
For example, while the landmarks panel has tried to preserve the small, 19th-century scale of the South Street Seaport Historic District, the planning commission has kept its zoning for fairly dense commercial development.
"There are some inherent tensions," Ms. Beckelman said. "That's why I believe it's much better, as a public policy, to consolidate unlike agencies to work together. It's much healthier to keep an arm's-length distance."

HEADLINE: NOTEBOOK;
Who Will Make a Mark on Pennant Races? Keep These Moves in Mind

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
When people sit around during the winter and predict the winners of the next season's pennant races, the "biggest mistake they make is focusing on the off season's comings and goings," Andy MacPhail says. "More times than not, it's things you don't foresee that determine the winners."
MacPhail, the highly successful general manager of the Minnesota Twins, probably is correct, but it's easier to anticipate the impact of the addition of Jack Morris to a pitching staff than divine the instant development of Chuck Knoblauch from a minor league Class AA player into a star major league second baseman. 
 This off season ends Friday when pitchers and catchers for 15 teams hold their first spring training workouts. For the most part, the major movement of players through trades and free agency has already been completed. Teams will spend the early weeks of spring training assessing the off season's comings and goings.
Checking some of those developments:
*Newly acquired players who are most capable of playing a significant role in the pennant races, or at least in their teams' possible rise in the standings: Bobby Bonilla and Bret Saberhagen (maybe Eddie Murray, too) of the Mets, Eric Davis (and maybe Tom Candiotti) of Los Angeles, Greg Swindell and Tim Belcher of Cincinnati, Morris and Dave Winfield of Toronto, Frank Viola of Boston, Danny Tartabull of the Yankees, Steve Sax of the Chicago White Sox, Kevin Mitchell of Seattle and Wally Joyner, Kevin McReynolds and Gregg Jefferies of Kansas City.
*The Fallen Angel: Whitey Herzog, California's $800,000 general manager, let Winfield go, was unable to re-sign Joyner and Kirk McCaskill and failed to sign the free agents Bonilla, Tartabull and Otis Nixon. He couldn't even persuade the Montreal Expos to take Lance Parrish for $1, with the added inducement of paying $1 million of the catcher's $2.25 million salary. As a consolation, Herzog added Von Hayes, Hubie Brooks and Alvin Davis to the Angels' lineup. Last season Joyner and Winfield together batted .282, hit 49 home runs and knocked in 182 runs; Hayes, Brooks and Davis batted a collective .228, hit 28 home runs and drove in 140 runs.
*Best moves without a checkbook: Bob Quinn of the Cincinnati Reds filled gaping holes in the starting pitching rotation by acquiring Swindell and Belcher and a vacancy at the top of the batting order by getting Bip Roberts.
*Best moves with a checkbook: Al Harazin of the Mets signed Bonilla and Murray in dramatic moves that woke up the team's slumbering fans. (The trade for Saberhagen was dramatic, too, but in economic terms, he comes cheaper than the departed Viola.)
*Gutsiest move: Herk Robinson's trade of Saberhagen.
*Most wholesale transformation of a team's appearance: Robinson acquired four and possibly five new players for Kansas City's starting lineup -- Joyner, McReynolds, Jefferies, Keith Miller and possibly Chris Gwynn. He also let shortstop Kurt Stillwell go as a free agent.
*Biggest shuffle of a division champion's roster: Six members of the Twins' World Series team plus a starting pitcher who just missed the post-season roster have gone elsewhere, some by the team's design (Junior Ortiz, Steve Bedrosian, Terry Leach, Allan Anderson), some by their own (Morris, Dan Gladden, Al Newman).
*Best use of management's newest gimmick for keeping salaries down: The Houston Astros have signed 13 major league players to minor league contracts, meaning the players have to make the team to get their major league salaries, which will be lower than they would have been had they signed major league contracts.
*Classiest move: Jim Leyland chose to sign a new five-year contract with Pittsburgh rather than wait until the end of the season and get out of the last year of his existing contract and flee to Florida and the expansion Marlins for what most likely would have been the biggest contract for a manager ever. Leyland decided to stay with the Pirates even though free agency threatens to devastate the team next year.
Some general managers and managers believe that even championship teams can't remain static. They say a team has to make at least a few changes to make sure complacency doesn't set in. But MacPhail said that no theory dictated the changes the Twins have undergone.
"We didn't have a philosophy one way or another," the general manager said. "The fortunate thing for us is with the young guys we have, we had the luxury of picking and choosing. The farm system was a safety net for us."
MacPhail did not include the loss of Morris, the World Series hero, in that explanation. "We pursued Morris and didn't get him," MacPhail said. The Twins also tried to re-sign Gladden, but the Detroit Tigers offered a better deal, including the prospect of more playing time.
Pedro Munoz, one of the young players MacPhail meant, will replace Gladden in left field. The Twins felt it was his time anyway. Gladden can run down fly balls better than Munoz, but Munoz has a better arm and should contribute more offensively.
Two other young players who will benefit from the roster shuffle are catcher Lenny Webster and pitcher Paul Abbott. Webster has played bits of the past three seasons with the Twins but is 27 years old and out of options. If he doesn't get a chance this year, he never will, at leaast not with the Twins.
Abbott will replace Steve Bedrosian in the bullpen. "There's no way we could keep Bedrosian around at 80 percent of what he made," MacPhail said. Even with the maximum cut allowed, the reliever would have had a $1.16 million salary. Bob Kipper, signed for $1 million, also will join the relief corps, which lost Leach as well as Bedrosian.
The Twins wanted to re-sign Newman for utility infield duty, but he didn't want to wait until they were ready to make that move, and he signed a minor league contract with Cincinnati.
The payroll race will heat up this week, with some of the largest salaries left in salary arbitration set to be decided. It appears to be a five-team race, with the tentative standings looking something like this:
Dodgers, $41.3 million; Athletics, $39.4 million; Mets, $39.2 million; Blue Jays, $39 million, and Red Sox, $38.3 million.
The totals are based on signed players who, at the moment, figure to be on the teams' 25-man rosters. Between now and opening day, the totals will change as more players sign and rosters change.
The Mets, for example, will take the lead as soon as David Cone's salary is determined -- his hearing is scheduled for tomorrow -- because at a minimum of $3 million, his pay will raise the Mets' running total to at least $42.2 million. If he wins his bid for $4.25 million, the payroll will reach $43.4 million.
The Blue Jays' total will rise to at least $40.8 million with the addition of Duane Ward's salary, and the Red Sox payroll will be at least $40.3 million when Ellis Burks's salary is added. The Dodgers and the Athletics, whose $39 million payroll was the highest last year, have no players left in arbitration. Oakland's remaining salaries will be meager while the Dodgers have only one more player, Ramon Martinez, who could command a sizable salary.
Other major cases scheduled for arbitration this week: John Smiley of Pittsburgh, Ruben Sierra and Rafael Palmeiro of Texas, Greg Swindell of Cincinnati and Tom Glavine of Atlanta.
One theory that has been advanced as a reason club owners oppose foreign ownership, particularly Japanese, is that cash-rich Japanese investors might escalate the salary scale to even higher levels. At least one owner disagrees.
"The theory that the Japanese would spend more money than present ownership is ridiculous," the owner said. "No one can spend more."

HEADLINE: A Long Run Down Vietnam's Memory Lane

BYLINE: By BARBARA BASLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam, Feb. 15

 BODY:
Andy Anderson, a blunt, almost cantankerous Vietnam veteran who uses a wheelchair because of a war injury, showed the radiance of a man returning home today as he spoke of once again seeing the city that used to be Saigon.
"I haven't been here since Dec. 23, 1973, and when I went out through the streets here this week, it was like I left last Friday and came back on Monday," said Anderson, who is from Long Beach, Calif., and who is here for the Ho Chi Minh City International Marathon, the first major sports event to be held in Vietnam since the fall of Saigon in 1975. 
 Anderson, 55 years old, lived in Saigon for two years while working as an adviser to the Vietnamese navy. "I lived across the street from the presidential palace," he said with excitement. "I fished these waters. I ate corned beef and cabbage every Saturday in a place near here, and the city hasn't changed much."
 
70's Look, 90's Optimism
 This sprawling, often elegant city, with discos with names like Satisfaction and Queen Bee, may look much as it did in the 1970's, but the marathon, with 133 runners from 26 countries, represents a real change for a country that reopened its doors to tourists only in 1987. Because of its stumbling economy, Vietnam is eager to rejoin the international community -- to attract foreign investors and foreign loans -- and this event is a way for Vietnam to show its new attitude.
The field is tiny compared with those for the marathons in New York or Boston, where thousands take part. But for most Americans competing here, especially the veterans, this was a race that for a variety of emotional reasons, they simply could not miss.
"I grew up with the war in Vietnam -- it was a part of all our lives -- and I wanted to be in this marathon because it was taking place in Vietnam," said Paul Gallagher, an American stockbroker who now works in Hong Kong.
Jim Barker, a former United States Army intelligence officer who served in Vietnam, said, "I came here for this marathon because I saw it as a chance for reconciliation."
Barker, an elite runner from San Jose, Calif., said that Sunday's marathon offered a chance "for a healing experience, a way to bridge differences, and deal with the very intense emotional traumas we lived through here."
From the beginning, this promised to be a quirky, unlikely sporting event in a country where running is a new sport. The sight of aging Americans, Australians and Frenchmen running through the streets in the shimmering Saigon heat has left many Vietnamese openly gawking and pointing.
 
'Very Happy Time'
 "I saw some foreigners -- very old," said a middle-aged shopkeeper who was selling souvenir T-shirts from a small sidewalk stall. "The foreigners were very old, but still they run. They enjoy it. This is a very happy time for them and a very happy time for us."
This marathon, a strange spectacle staged by Vietnamese Communists working with American advisers and using capitalist money from foreign corporations, has old enemies facing each other on a new battlefield: the race course. And most find the combination a heady, happy one, though it is laced with sadness, a sense of poignancy.
When Anderson and three other disabled American veterans went out on the street, many older Vietnamese, survivors of the war, came up to greet them. Some shook their hands, others introduced their sons and daughters.
Anderson and other American wheelchair athletes came to compete, and there were able to do so in a preliminary "fun" event today. But the Vietnamese organizers decided that because they were not prepared to field wheelchair athletes, only runners would be included in Sunday's race. American veterans had donated three racing chairs to Vietnam's sports ministry in hopes of persuading the Vietnamese to allow the wheelchair athletes to compete.
 
'A Peaceful Moment'
 A runner from San Mateo, Calif., Linda Shinazy, said she had been opposed to the war and had protested it by writing letters on eye-catching red stationery, "to anyone and everyone."
This little marathon, she said, "was a chance for me to celebrate peace."
"It's a small moment in history, a peaceful moment," she said.
While hundreds of Vietnamese took part in the short "fun" races, only 92 will compete in the marathon, and only 8 of them have ever run a marathon before. The course winds through the center of the city, to the gritty outskirts, and into the green countryside before returning to Reunification Hall, the former presidential palace.
Since the war ended, Vietnam has remained mired in poverty. One official here admitted that while the Communists had "helped the masses" take part in more sports, the people literally "don't have the food, enough calories" to have large numbers of regular marathon runners.
"The few Vietnamese who were trying to train were running in running in rubber thongs," said Bruce Aitken, the American financial consultant who first suggested the marathon to the Vietnamese. He said that when Adidas, one of the major sponsors of the marathon, donated 1,000 pairs of running shoes, the Vietnamese, "who are really very competitive people," got very interested in training.
To open the marathon weekend, there were speeches by Communist officials wearing suits and ties and sunglasses. There were firecrackers, silky banners and dozens of red balloons released into the clear blue sky. There was even a live rock band and a special marathon song sung by Tran Tien, whom one Vietnamese explained was "a very popular singer, known in all of Vietnam."
A top Vietnamese sports official said that his country hoped that by staging events like the marathon, "We will someday be able to host something really big, like the Olympics."
In fact, the official, Le Buu, head of the Ho Chi Minh Sports Authority, said Vietnam planned to send a delegation to Barcelona, Spain, for the 1992 Olympic Summer Games. And while he was vague about what Olympic events the Vietnamese would compete in there, he said, "Definitely we will send a shooting team."

HEADLINE: SPRING TRAINING;
For Torborg and Mets, Attitude Is Everything

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla., Feb. 15

 BODY:
In early spring, baseball teams are all theory, statistical projections and elaborate constructs of the heart. As such, the Mets, perhaps the recession's most conspicuous consumers, are at the moment an extraordinary, even exquisite abstraction.
There is the image of Bobby Bonilla looping doubles into either gap from both sides of the plate. There is the confident calculation that Vince Coleman's speed and Willie Randolph's subtle mastery of the fundamentals of offense can create a perpetual threat at the top of the order. There is the perilous leap of faith that Howard Johnson can convert into a center fielder and the rather more secure assumption that he will continue to consistently convert men on base into runs scored. And then there is the enormous exercise in optimism that the entire organization is engaged in: that Dwight Gooden can return from surgery and return to form on the mound. 
 And so it will be on Friday that at last the abstraction begins its transformation into an identifiable and quantifiable reality. The checkbook signatures and salary figures will have exhausted their worth in promotional publicity. Formulas will become faces and lineups more than attractive assortments of names. Spring training opens for the Mets as pitchers and catchers report and 1992 takes shape.
 
'Preconceived Notions'
 "I'm going into it all with a certain number of preconceived notions," said Jeff Torborg, the manager who has a wonderful track record and absolutely zero history with the Mets. "But I don't know how it will all come down."
Torborg, though, insists that he knows how it will all start to come together for the Mets, and that is with the atmosphere in the clubhouse. Long distinguished as a kind of sinkhole of silence and cynicism, the clubhouse under Torborg could actually become a locus of respect for one another and authentic enthusiasm for the game.
"I'm going with the same approach as when I had the youngest team in baseball with the White Sox," said Torborg, who was the American League's manager of the year with that team in 1990. "I believe in attitude, and I don't care how old you are. I'm going to hit them over the head with attitude every day, every week. It's the only way I know how to do it."
But how the Mets will do it on the field in 1992 is a sizable, if intriguing, mystery. Johnson, the longtime third baseman and raw right fielder, is being asked to become the team's most influential outfielder. The assignment amounts to a complex and possibly combustible experiment.
"I want, obviously, to see how it will work, and that means probably playing Howard al lot more in the spring than you might otherwise ask of a veteran," said Torborg. "I told him I might ultimately decide to go another way, and that I was dependent on him being as honest as possible with me about how he felt out there.
"For me, it's going to be a real gut read," said Torborg, whose alternative is to return Vince Coleman from left to center and send Johnson to either left or right, with Bonilla taking up the position Johnson doesn't. "If I get to a point where I don't feel comfortable, I'll make the switch. It might be in the middle of March. It might be the last week before the season starts. But if he's making progress, my plan is to stick with him."
Another area of concern for Torborg is his catching situation. In what has been the most overlooked and possibly outrageous assumption, the Mets are trusting that Todd Hundley, the 22-year-old rookie who has hit a combined .173 in his bits of two seasons in the major leagues, can approximate an everyday catcher. Charlie O'Brien, after all, has demonstrated that he is a bona fide .200 presence at the plate, and Mackey Sasser, with his mental block about returning the baseball to the pitcher, is a partly disabled performer.
"I don't want to cast doubts on what we have," said Torborg. "I think we are adequately fortified. But I am concerned about our handling of our pitchers. I might wind up using a system of three catchers."
Torborg, meanwhile, has shown no particular inclination to employ only one third baseman. He has said that Bill Pecota is his current preference as a regular, but he has made it clear that Dave Magadan will earn himself starts there if he can stop baseballs with proficiency. There are those who believe that Magadan, a legitimate albeit light bat, has to be in the lineup consistently if the final third of the order -- Kevin Elster, Hundley and the pitcher -- isn't to be a daily and dramatic drag on the offense.
And then there is Gooden. The right-hander's rehabilitation from rotator cuff surgery is unfolding without incident, but also without any accompanying guarantees. Maybe he'll start the season with the Mets, maybe he won't be ready until May, maybe it won't matter if the accomplished Bret Saberhagen, the ambitious David Cone and the physically reconfigured -- that is to say thinner -- Sid Fernandez pitch up to potential.
"What I can tell you is that no ground rules have been handed down to me by the organization," Torborg said of Gooden's present and future status. "We're to go start by start, pitch by pitch."
 
Questions, Questions
 And of course, the Mets, piece by piece, will be defined through the spring by other evaluations. Will night close fast on Randolph and Eddie Murray, the right side of the infield that has clearly entered the twilight of its career? Will John Franco be the cocky closer he was or the tortured pitcher who last year finished 75th in the major leagues in the ratio of men allowed on base per inning pitched. Will Torborg, who has shown himself to be more comfortable answering questions on radio than Bud Harrelson was, be as polished handling crises in the dugout?
Time will tell. Time has also run out on the attractive abstraction that the Mets have been since they last left the diamond.

The Olympics Don't Need Us vs. Them

BYLINE: By DAVE ANDERSON

DATELINE: ALBERTVILLE, France

 BODY:
IN their red uniforms with "CCCP" in white, the Soviet Union hockey players once were the scourge of the Winter Olympics, a team that all but melted the ice under their opponents. In those years, the Soviets were the "enemy" that some Americans seemed to need in order to reduce international sports to a morality play.
In those years, the cold war of politics had created the gold war of the Olympics, Winter and Summer. 
 When the United States hockey team won the gold at Lake Placid in 1980, its "miracle on ice" momentarily cured America's inferiority complex about sports on ice and snow. The enemy had been conquered. Us against them, and us had won.
Hooray for the red, white and blue!
Now, with the collapse of the Soviet Union and its transformation into the Commonwealth of Independent States, and the formation of one Germany, there's no enemy in the Olympics for the American public. No they. No them. And that's the way it should be. The Olympics don't need an enemy.
But according to some American voices bouncing off the satellite into the Savoy region, from where these XVI Olympic Winter Games are being beamed to the world on television, the CBS network is still trying to create us-against-them theater for its United States viewers.
Hooray for the American who finishes 16th in the 1,000-meter Nordic combined bobsled biathlon slalom off the Alpine ski jump while shooting a hockey puck before spinning a triple axel!
After all, that's the us-against-them philosophy. And if this is the Olympics, it must be us against them. If only because it always has been. When the American athletes won all those gold medals in the 1984 Summer Games in Los Angeles that the Soviet Union boycotted, Americans cheered as never before. As if "we" were really that good.
But without the Soviet Union and most of the Eastern bloc nations, the Olympic track-and-field events in Los Angeles had resembled a U.C.L.A. invitational meet.
When the United States had boycotted the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, Americans didn't bother to count who won all the gold medals. If it wasn't a real Olympics in Moscow, it wasn't a real Olympics in Los Angeles, either. But all that counted in Los Angeles was that we won big.
We, we, we. Us, us, us.
But for Americans and everybody else, we and us should be removed from the Olympic vocabulary. If they and them don't exist anymore, we and us don't. Without a cold war, there's no gold war. It's obvious now that the relation of Olympic strength to a nation's strength was always propaganda, never proof.
When the Kremlin folded after the Berlin Wall fell, the importance of those nations' Olympic medals melted. And all those United States medals in Los Angeles weren't able to prevent America's economic slide into its current recession.
What the Olympics means, and have always meant, is, quite simply, the opportunity for an athlete to say that he or she is the best in the world in that event on that day.
That's what Bonnie Blair of Champaign, Ill., has done twice, winning the women's 500 and 1,000 in speed skating. That's what Donna Weinbrecht of West Milford, N.J., did in winning the first women's gold medal in a new Olympic sport, freestyle mogul skiing.
That's what Patrick Ortlieb of Austria did in swooping to the gold medal in the men's downhill.
That's what Jacqueline Borner of Germany did in striding to the 1,500 speed-skating gold medal as Bonnie Blair, realizing she couldn't win, faded to 21st in order to save some energy for the 1,000 two days later.
On the medal stand, Borner, once an East German but now simply a German, could be seen smiling and sighing. Smiling at knowing she was the best in the world in that event on that day. Sighing at knowing she had not missed her only opportunity in these Olympics to be the best in the world in that event on that day.
That's what all those Unified Team athletes have done in maintaining the gold-medal tradition of the Soviet athletes. For them, there's also no us and them anymore.
That's what all Olympic athletes strive for. Simply to be the best in the world in that event on that day. To compete, as Bonnie Blair said, "for myself, not for anybody else." Certainly not for us against them. Because if there's no them, there can't be an us.

HEADLINE: Pat Buchanan's Politics of Pain

 BODY:
He started his New Hampshire primary campaign intending to push President Bush back to old-time Republican religion. Then he came to New Hampshire, where businesses have failed in record numbers, unemployment in some towns has exceeded 20 percent and welfare rolls have swollen. Meet the new Patrick Buchanan.
Now the archconservative journalist campaigns by assailing "vulture capitalism." Now the thundering apostle of free-market economics proclaims that "conservatism is about more than the constitutional right of big fishes to eat little fishes." 
 Pat Buchanan, the raging right-winger who once said AIDS was nature's retribution against homosexuals, now speaks sympathetically of AIDS victims. He who once denounced extending unemployment benefits, now favors doing so.
Faced with New Hampshire's pain, the man who started out trying to force George Bush to the right is now making campaign pitches worthy of a New Deal Democrat. He has rediscovered, and responds to, a political fundamental often forgotten inside the Beltway: People in pain want help, not ideology.
The new Pat Buchanan was on display during the last full week before Tuesday's primary. For instance, in Londonderry, N.H., he spoke on behalf of a couple who'd lost their jobs and then their home. Standing with Steve Embry in front of the condominium that the bank had taken away, he argued that bankers should be permitted by law "to carry their folks for a while the way the best of them did in the Depression."
His conversion to this new-time religion may or may not be sincere. But it is paying dividends. Barely three weeks ago, President Bush seemed destined to bury Mr. Buchanan, who had never been elected to anything. Now with the election two days away, the President is scrambling to preserve a convincing margin of victory.
Mr. Bush, having failed in his State of the Union Message to show New Hampshire voters that he grasps the extent of their economic travail, surely understands the potential erosion of support. He is putting in long, hard closing campaign days trying to show that he, too, hears the pain.
So far voters are repeating as their own some ideas heard in Buchanan advertisements. "We can't afford Bush for another four years," said a woman in western New Hampshire. In Portsmouth, on the coast, a man criticized the President because "He doesn't have a real economic plan."
Neither does Pat Buchanan, ideologue, but he does have an ear, and he is listening.

For Want of A Nail

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
It may have been the greatest failure of American political imagination since World War II, the costliest abdication of leadership: President Bush's failure to join promptly in helping to build new societies in what had been the Soviet Union.
So we must begin to think as we see what is happening in the former Soviet republics today. There are devastating inflation and economic distress, social tension, political menace. People are asking whether Boris Yeltsin can survive in Russia or may be overthrown by a new authoritarianism of the right. 
 The stakes are enormous, not just for them but for us -- Europe, the United States, the developed world. Collapse of the democratic experiment in the republics would create a refugee crisis of large proportions. It could destabilize the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe. It would turn a potential opportunity for world trade and investment into threatening uncertainty.
Weimar is the grisly example in history: the German democracy whose collapse led to war and the Holocaust. It was brought forcefully to mind when anti-Yeltsin marchers in Moscow shouted against Jews and called for the return of Communism.
The transition from the Soviet system to market democracy was inevitably going to be difficult. And of course it could not be an American responsibility. But what a difference U.S. help -- and as important, a visibly sympathetic American attitude -- could have made.
What President Bush has offered instead, over the last year, has been disregard. When Germany proposed a collaborative effort by the industrial powers to help economically, Mr. Bush said no. He would not even move last summer on emergency assistance, leaving it to Congress to come up with a $500 million plan to transport food and help disable nuclear weapons.
Political fear was no doubt the explanation for Mr. Bush's performance. He was being criticized for neglecting domestic affairs, and polls showed that Americans were increasingly skeptical about foreign aid when they themselves were suffering economically.
But a leader would have explained to the American people how large the stakes were, how great the opportunity. That is what Harry Truman did with Greek-Turkish aid, the Marshall Plan, the North Atlantic Treaty. And Americans responded, taking on those burdens.
The key to the Marshall Plan's success was not only, or mainly, American money. It was the political and psychological effect of the American commitment, and of the requirement imposed by the United States that the recipient countries of Western Europe draw up their own recovery plan.
It would not have taken -- it would not take -- huge amounts of U.S. money to help the former Soviet republics significantly. A favorable American response would have brought in the other developed countries. Economists say that $25 billion a year would make a great difference, and not much of that would have to come from the U.S.
The United States spent upward of $100 billion a year (in 1992 dollars) on the defense of Europe during the decades of the cold war. Now, for want of comparatively trivial sums, we may lose the hope that the end of the cold war brought: hope of the Soviet republics turned into productive and democratic participants in the world economy. And the hope of the former Soviet satellites is at risk, too.
President Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia, when he spoke to Congress two years ago, said: "You can help us most of all if you help the Soviet Union on its irreversible but immensely complicated road to democracy." His Foreign Minister, Jiri Dienstbier, proposed a modest, sensible financial plan for the U.S.S.R. and its former satellites. But it got nowhere in the Bush Administration.
Prof. Richard Neustadt, the Harvard chronicler of Presidential power and its uses, expressed anguish the other day at this Presidential episode. "It just seems to me terrible," he said. "I fear for what is going to happen in Prague and Warsaw and all the Soviet capitals. If there had been just some show of American forthcomingness. . . ."
If things go wrong, George Bush will go down as the American President who saved the Emir of Kuwait and lost, for democracy, the great land mass between the Vistula and Vladivostok.

HEADLINE: A New Baja California

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD; ROBERT REINHOLD is chief of the Los Angeles bureau of The New York Times.

 BODY:
WHEN Mexico's 1,059-mile Transpeninsular Highway No. 1 finally opened in 1973, Baja California Sur, one of the least traveled regions in the world, seemed ready to emerge from centuries of isolation. Until then, Baja, the world's longest peninsula, longer than the Italian peninsula, was reserved for rugged adventurers in four-wheel-drive vehicles for whom communing with cardon cactus in the desert or watching gray whales on magnificent deserted white beaches was sufficient reward for the arduous journey over rutted dirt roads.
But development came slowly. Despite its grand name, the "highway" was a narrow winding two-lane road without shoulders that quickly became pocked and rutted and easily washed out during rains, as it did during last January's downpours. Moreover, gasoline supplies were uncertain, accommodations limited and water scarce. For better or worse, Baja resisted tourists, much as it had Spanish explorers and missionaries and other invaders during its turbulent history. 
 To this day, Baja California Sur, or B.C.S., remains the most remote and inaccessible of Mexican states. It achieved statehood only in 1974, the year after the road opened. While fast growing, its population is only about 250,000, scarcely a tenth of that of Baja California, the state that encompasses the more-developed northern half of the peninsula that abuts the American border. Even Mexicans from the "mainland" remain a little hazy about it; they sometimes ask if they need passports to visit B.C.S. and what language is spoken there. In fact, given that most of the 600,000 visitors a year come from California, it is quite easy to get by with English.
Yet, fitfully and unevenly, this land of extraordinary beautyis finally showing signs of entering the age of tourism, but at a price not easily measured in pesos or dollars. New developments are concentrated mainly in three areas: around Loreto on the Gulf of California (or the Sea of Cortes as Mexican maps refer to it), in the capital city of La Paz, and in the Los Cabos area at the very southern tip of the peninsula. Clean, pleasant hotel accommodations, usually at moderate prices, are now available throughout Baja. And recreational-vehicle drivers, to the dismay of those who treasure the rugged magnificence of the Baja coasts, find they are all too welcome to park at water's edge at almost any beach for $3.50 or $4 a night, or even free at more remote spots.
As a result, some of the most beautiful beaches in the world, those along the western shore of Concepcion Bay near Mulege on the Gulf of California, have become squalid-looking encampments of house trailers from California and Arizona. Four hundred forty-fourmiles to the south, the fishing village of Cabo San Lucas at the spectacular rocky tip of the Baja pensinsula, is no longer the private preserve of wealthy yachtsmen and movie stars. Resorts are blooming along the 18-mile beach corridor between Cabo and San Jose; two sushi bars have opened in Cabo, and a massive hotel and condominium complex now squats on the once picturesque Cabo harbor, where aggressive time-share salespeople have replaced turista as the main scourge afflicting American visitors.
Mexican tourism officials and local hotel developers insist they will avoid the mistakes made at Acapulco, Cancun and other major Mexican destinations, saying they intend to control the size, density and architecture of Baja resorts and impose strict pollution controls. Whether one accepts such assurances, a natural factor does impose some tough limits on commercial exploitation: water. Unless desalination of sea water becomes economical, scarce supplies of fresh water will forever protect the peninsula from gross excess.
Even today, it takes little to find the old Baja, where electricity, television and telephones are still a novelty. Driving just a few minutes out of any town takes the visitor into a splendid, stark and arid land of rare cactus, snakes, date palms, Spanish missions, snow-white beaches, dusty villages, cafes under palapa roofs, and friendly, hospitable people.
Despite Baja's enormous beauty, it has not been easy for Mexico to develop the area. The National Trust Fund for Tourist Development, or Fonatur, is the 18-year-old Federal agency that builds the roads, docks, water and sewer lines, electric power plants and other elements of infrastructure meant to stimulate private investment in hotels, golf courses, marinas and other tourist facilities in Mexico. It has placed two of its five major projects in B.C.S. -- at Loreto and Los Cabos. The others are Cancun on the Yucatan peninsula, which gets a million visitors a year, and Ixtapa and Huatulco, on the Pacific Coast.
Fonatur's experience at Loreto illustrates the problems inherent in development in Baja California. Founded in 1697 by the Jesuit priest Juan Maria Salvaterria, Loreto was the site of the first of the chain of Roman Catholic missions established throughout the Californias and was the first capital of all California, including what is now the American state of California. Its spectactular setting on a dramatic bay edged with the craggy dark volcanic peaks of the Sierra de la Giganta made it a likely spot for tourism. Fonatur's Loreto plan has three elements: sprucing up the historic old town, building a resort area about 10 miles south at Nopolo, and development of a marina-hotel complex at nearby Puerto Escondido.
THE agency has gracefully restored the old mission, Our Lady of Loreto, the largest structure in town, with its gilded altar. Next door, an informative museum was added to illustrate life in the old missions. The agency also improved the waterfront, building a milelong sea wall for walking and two-line roadway divided by a grassy mall with palms, and a protected harbor for fishing boats and yachts. Three pleasant small hotels operate along the waterfront, and streets have been laid out anticipating that the town of only 8,000 will ultimately grow to 57,000 to serve the tourists. But there are few tourists yet.
At Nopolo, a beautiful seaside 18-hole golf course is nearing completion, there is a professional tennis center with eight courts, buildings ready for shops, water and telephone lines meant to serve condominiums and retirement homes. But so far there are few homes and only one hotel, the 250-room Stouffer Presidente Loreto, which is struggling. A few miles south, Fonatur has put new docks and a group of French and Mexican investors has agreed to put up two hotels, as well as a condominium-hotel and a marina, to attract the Newport Beach crowd.
But 10 years after the Loreto project began, only 455 of the 7,500 projected hotel rooms have been built, and they usually go begging. According to Manuel Martinez, the Fonatur director at Loreto, several factors have contributed to the sluggish pace, including investor worries about water supplies (a new 20-mile aqueduct has been built to bring in ground water) and resistance of airlines to providing service to the new international airport. It gets only one international flight a day, a daily Aero California jet from Los Angeles. The highway passes right by town, but brings only 17 percent of Loreto's visitors.
With its extensive underused facilties, Loreto makes an excellent low-cost base for exploration of the central Baja peninsula and the off-shore islands of Carmen and Coronado, where the fishing and swimming are unmatched. It is also near one of the finest of the restored Spanish missions, the Mision San Javier, in a steep remote valley 22 miles from Loreto. The drive on a rough, rutted dirt road seems more like 100 miles, but it takes the visitor through some of the most characteristic of Baja desert countryside, with occasional ranches, wild burros, barrel cactus, poppies and zalate and mesquite trees. Standing before this church, built of five-foot-thick volcanic stones in 1758, one can imagine the stark isolation and hardship those early padres endured.
The road is passable by a well-built sedan, depending on conditions, such as rains. Inquire locally before venturing forth. And, as ever in Baja California, even on the main highway, always carry water and food, drive slowly because hazards like potholes, ruts, rock slides or a herd of cows can appear around any corner. Given the often poor road conditions, it is best to avoid driving at night.
Loreto also offers convenient access to the exquisite white beaches of Concepcion Bay, about 50 miles to the north. The first beaches on the bay are much less likely to be crowded with house trailers than those closer to Mulege, like Santispac. The oasis town of Mulege, with another fine restored mission, is a favorite of American expatriates.
If Loreto has been slow to develop, one almost wishes the same could be said of Los Cabos. The two towns at the bottom of the peninsula, San Jose and Cabo San Lucas, were once the definition of isolation, without access by paved roads, without telephones and electricity. Mark Parr, whose father, Bud Parr, pioneered in opening hotels there and who manages the family's Hacienda Beach Resort on the beach in Cabo now, recalls his days as a child when his father picked up guests in La Paz in a private plane. That was when stars like John Wayne, Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra sought privacy at the area's first hotel, the Palmilla. It opened in 1956 and is still operating.
Those quiet days are long gone. Two paved roads now connect Los Cabos to La Paz, the capital, 95 miles away, and an international airport at San Jose offers nonstop flights from San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego and Phoenix. Both towns are awash with hotel and condominium construction. For example, at the famed Hotel Finisterra, built in 1970 into the cliffs near land's end, a 10-story condominium complex is going up on the beach. Next door at the Hotel Solmar, Luis Bulnes, a Spaniard who came to Cabo to manage a fish cannery in 1954, when the population was only 300, is putting up condo units and time-share units to supplement the 66 stark white boxlike rooms he built into the cliffs in 1974. Wealthy Americans, mostly from California, have put up vacation villas in the Pedegal Hills above downtown Cabo.
That is only the beginning. With a loan from the World Bank, an ambitious master plan for the area has been developed by Fonatur. It envisions adding nearly 8,000 hotel rooms to the current inventory of 2,700 rooms by the year 2000 and another 4,000 by 2020. Another 100 holes of golf courses are due to open by mid-1993. A major part of the plan is development of La Playita, a megaresort next to the estuary in San Jose, to include two hotels, villas with 1,800 rooms, 1,000 condominium units, a beach club and water park and a 36-hole golf course. Two resorts are planned on the beach corridor between the two towns.
According to Luis Klein, director of the Los Cabos Tourism Board, the strategy is to market the area as a smaller, more exclusive version of Cancun, or "Palm Springs with an ocean," as he put it. "We are not looking for that kind of growth," he said. "We want to remain normal scale, which will not spoil it for all of us." Both Mr. Parr and Mr. Bulnes argued that since much of the land remains in the hands of a few families, they can prevent the kind of ungainly sprawl that has spoiled Acapulco and other Mexican resorts. They said limited water supplies, in any case, would impose controls.
That remains to be seen. But for now Los Cabos, for all the growth, remains an attractive if costly destination with stunning beaches and scenery, great sportfishing and some passable restaurants. The two towns are quite different. San Jose, the older one, has the feel of a colonial village, with its quaint main plaza with interesting shops and restaurants. Cabo is more for the youthful yachting set, with its noisy bars and discos.
But it is easy enough to get away from the commercialism. Just drive a few miles up Mexico 19, the route to La Paz on the Pacific side of the peninsula, to a stretch of desolate unspoiled beaches. Forty-four miles up the road is the delightful town of Todos Santos, a former sugar-cane center opened to visitors only since 1985 when the road was paved. With its graceful church and town square, it has become something of an artist's colony and retreat for expatriates like Ezio Colombo, from Milan, Italy, and his New Yorker wife, Paula, who have opened a very pleasant Italian restaurant on the square, the Cafe Santa Fe.
For a taste of real modern-day Mexico, a visit to La Paz, the state capital, is essential. This prosperous-looking friendly city of 150,000, where the Spanish conquistador Hernan Cortes first set foot in 1535, is one of the most appealing of Mexican cities. Set around a great curving bay, it has the virtues of offering all tourist amenities, including deep-sea fishing, while not being primarily a tourist town. It is the main ferry connection to the mainland of Mexico and serves as the administrative nerve center of the region.
La Paz offers a vivid glimpse of the vibrancy of Mexican street life, particularly along the malecon, or sea wall, on the picturesque harbor, where local youths nightly parade and cruise in their cars.
The city has a grand plan to develop marinas, golf courses, parks and other tourist facilities, but no money to implement it. It is just as well, for La Paz remains appealing as it is. La Paz also offers some intellectual fare in a region that is otherwise a domain of sports: Visit the Biblioteca de Historia de las Californias, which has a display of paintings and a good collection of books in both Spanish and English about the history of Baja California (Plaza Constitucion, telephone 682-2-01-62, Monday through Friday 8 A.M. to 8 P.M.). Also don't miss the Museo Antropologico de Baja California Sur, a small but informative museum displaying the geology, folk art and history of the region. (Calle 5 de Mayo and Calle Ignacio Altamirano, telephone 682-2-01-62, Tuesday through Saturday, 9 A.M. to 6 P.M.)
Moreover, it is only a 15-mile drive northeast of town along a nicely paved new road to the beaches of Balandra and Tecolote, two of the most serene and beautiful beaches on the face of this planet.
 
 
 
EXPLORING THE REMOTE MEXICAN PENINSULA
Getting There
 Baja California Sur is most easily explored by flying into Los Cabos, La Paz or Loreto, then renting a car. Most major American car rental companies are represented at the airports at San Jose del Cabo, which serves Los Cabos, and La Paz, the capital of the state, but not at Loreto. Most major hotels also offer car rentals. Jeeps are widely available.
Renting a car is expensive, about $575 a week for a midsized Mexican-made Volkswagen Golf, for example. That includes taxes and liability insurance, which is essential because American policies are not honored in Mexico and, if you are uninsured, having an accident can mean spending your vacation in jail until matters are sorted out. The drop-off fee for cars left in another city is about 40 cents a mile. Rent in advance and have the rental company send a confirmation, including the rate as well as the drop fee, if applicable. Drive with caution, carry water and food when leaving town and always keep the gas tank at least half full. Don't pick up hitchhikers. If they happen to be carrying drugs, you could be considered an accessory. Lead-free gasoline (magna sin) is usually available at government-run Pemex stations at about $1.65 a gallon. If you have car trouble or run out of gas, take advantage of the government-sponsored Green Angels who patrol the peninsula to offer tourists free mechanical assistance, in addition to gas, parts and oil at cost.
"Baja California," published for members by the Automobile Club of Southern California, is an invaluable sourcebook.
The arduous but spectacular 1,059-mile journey down the peninsula from the American border could easily take a week. Accommodations along the way are good, even in remote locations. Leave time for the return, as American rental cars cannot be dropped off in Mexico. Be sure your vehicle is in good repair, and don't fail to buy Mexican insurance at the border, at about $10 to $14 a day. Americans must also, under a new regulation, carry documentary evidence that their vehicles carry full United States automobile insurance, or post a bond based on the value of the car.
A third route is to take a ferry from the Mexican mainland to La Paz or Santa Rosalia.
 
The Cabos
 Los Cabos offers a wide variety of hotels. All rates are for winter and exclude 15 percent Federal tax and a service charge of 10 to 20 percent. The most luxurious is the 150-room Hotel Palmilla, on the beach five miles west of San Jose del Cabo. Doubles start at $250 a night. Telephone (684)-20155 direct, (800) 528-1234 in the United States. (The country code for Mexico is 52.)
In Cabo San Lucas, good choices are the Hacienda Beach Resort, on a calm swimming beach that is walking distance from the center of town, at $118 to $170 for a double, (684)-30123 or (800) 733-2226; the Hotel Solmar at $95 a night, (684)-30022 or (800) 344-3349, and its neighbor, the Hotel Finisterra at $100 to $115, (684) 30000 or (800) 347-2252. A budget choice is the 72-room colonial-style Hotel Mar de Cortez in the center of town, starting at $33, (684)-30032 or (800) 347-8821.
Among Cabo restaurants, a favorite of American expatriates is Mi Casa, with a large patio. It serves a tasty pozole (hominy soup) at $4 and an excellent chicken with mole sauce for $10.65. (On the main square, behind the Aero California office; telephone 31933). An old favorite is El Rey Sol, where fish filet Veracruzana is $8, including soup and salad. (Across from Marina Sol Condominiums; 31117). For steaks and seafood, try the Faro Viejo, situated, oddly, in a trailer park, at the corner of Abasalo and Rosario Morales (no phone). In San Jose del Cabo, the Damiana restaurant has a romantic garden. The imperial shrimp steak is $20. (18 Boulevard Mijares; 20499).
In the little town of Todos Santos, on the way to La Paz, is the Hotel California, on Benito Juarez. Doubles are in the $20 to $35 range; telephone (682)-40002 or, in the United States, (415) 768-0614.
 
La Paz
 Less touristy, La Paz offers some good hotel bargains. The best hotel in the center of town, the Hotel Los Arcos right on the sea wall, is $55 double, (682)-22744 or (800) 421-3772. For more isolation, there's the Hotel Las Arenas, 44 miles southeast of La Paz at the end of an 11-mile dirt road, so remote it has no phone, but miles of empty beaches. Rates start at $115 double, (800) 423-4784 in the United States or, in California, (800) 352-4334.
A pleasant local restaurant is Las Brisas, under a palapa roof opposite the beach on Paseo Alvaro Obregon at Heroico Colegio Militar (no phone). A meal of typical Mexican food is $10 to $15.
In Loreto, the best place to stay is the only luxury resort within 225 miles, the 250-room Stouffer Presidente Loreto, about eight miles south of town. Doubles are $70 to $100, (683)-30700 or (800) 468-3571. There are also three modest but clean hotels on the bay in town, all in the $40 to $50 range for doubles: Hotel La Pinta, (683)-30025 or (800) 336-5454, Hotel Mision de Loreto, (683)-30048, and Hotel Oasis, (683)-30112.
A favorite restaurant of American visitors is Caesar's, at the corner of Calle Zapata and Calle Benito Juarez (telephone 30203). A Mexican lunch or dinner is about $3.50 to $5.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 1, 1992, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Feb. 16 about Baja California, Mexico, included several incorrect telephone numbers. The number in the United States for the Hotel Palmilla, near San Jose del Cabo, is (800) 637-2226 and the direct number is (684) 21707. Hotel Las Arenas, southeast of La Paz, has no telephone. In Cabo San Lucas, the Hacienda Beach Resort's number is (668) 48644. The preferred number in the United States for the Hotel Mar de Cortez, also in Cabo San Lucas, is (408) 375-4755. The Hotel California, in Todos Santos, no longer has a United States number, and the "800" number for Hotel Los Arcos, in La Paz, has been disconnected.

HEADLINE: Children and Video Games

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In her review of my book, "Playing With Power in Movies, Television, and Video Games," Marie Winn challenges my assumption that video games have cognitive value for children (a conclusion supported by virtually every book on the subject) and erroneously claims that the empirical studies I cite "do not, unfortunately, include the major users of video games -- healthy 8- to 11-year-old boys." If she had looked at the endnotes, she would have seen that 25 of the empirical studies I mention do in fact deal with this group -- along with healthy girls. And so do the ethnographic studies I did with my own 8-year-old son and with children at a video arcade and a day-care center, which are described at length in two appendixes. 
 Ms. Winn is probably so obstinate in denying the cognitive value of video games because this position is consistent with the sweeping denun ciations of mass media featured in her own book "The Plug-In Drug: Television, Children and the Family."
Although she fails to mention my book's central emphasis on how commercial supersystems like Nintendo and Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtles commodify growth and how their popularity is related to the global economics of the 1980's and 90's, she gives great weight to one minor point: "Children heavily involved with video games may come to believe that athletes who win gold medals in the Olympics, or writers and scientists who win the Nobel Prize, are performing tasks that are no more important or difficult than winning at video games."
Undoubtedly she chose that point not because it is representative of my argument, but rather as a lead-in to her own dubious speculation (which I am criticized for omitting) that "children accustomed to the quick gratifications of video games may not be willing to put up with the arduous efforts necessary to learn to play a musical instrument well, or to excel at tennis." Anyone who has ever played video games knows that it takes practice to excel at Nintendo.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: Downtown Houston;
Hines Renovating 2 Shell Towers He Built in 70's

BYLINE: By LETTICE STUART

DATELINE: HOUSTON

 BODY:
GERALD D. HINES, the local developer who made a fortune building high-profile projects around the country, has begun his first major office project in downtown Houston since 1983. This time, however, it is rehabilitation, not new construction.
He has begun a major renovation of two Houston skyscrapers that he developed two decades ago -- the 50-story 1 Shell Plaza and the 29-story 2 Shell Plaza. The $95 million project is the largest of any kind in downtown Houston in the last five years. 
 Hines Interests Limited Partnership currently has more office buildings under construction than any other developer in the country, accounting for about a tenth of all the major development now under way. But times are changing.
Projects like the one in Shell Plaza are part of a new strategy for Mr. Hines to adapt to the recession: While looking for new construction projects abroad, he is focusing in this country on renovation of older properties and the acquisition of existing ones.
The real estate market of the 90's will be vastly different from that of the last decade, said the 66-year-old developer, whose empire spreads across 34 American cities. Mr. Hines believes overbuilding in the 80's and the industry's retrenchment in the 90's will cause demand for new commercial space to shrink by as much as 50 percent.
So just what does a developer do when demand for new construction dwindles? What does the future hold for the company that has grown from a one-man operation in 1957 to an 1,100-employee conglomerate with regional offices in Chicago, New York, San Francisco and Atlanta?
Mr. Hines believes development opportunities abound in Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. The company opened an office in Berlin last year and recently announced plans for a mixed-use project there in partnership with Four Seasons Hotel Ltd. of Toronto. The $280 million development, scheduled to start late this year and be completed in 1995, will include offices, apartments, a 225-room hotel and stores built around a landscaped courtyard.
Investors in the project include a group of German businessmen who own property on the block on Franzosische Strasse where the development will be built.
"We're looking at other opportunities abroad, but timing is of the utmost importance," Mr. Hines said. "We have to be careful not to move in to a market too early." The danger is putting up a building before a country's economy is viable enough to support it, he said.
Buying existing properties in the United States is another new direction for the privately held company, which is headed by Mr. Hines as chairman and his 36-year-old son, Jeff, as president. No properties have been purchased yet, but the company has spent the last two years cataloguing every property in every city that it would be interested in acquiring.
"We're doing detailed workups on each property so that when they become available, we'll be ready," Mr. Hines said. "But the timing isn't right yet. Prices are still falling."
The company is looking primarily at office and retail projects "that have outstanding reputations and locations," Mr. Hines said.
Meantime, as construction declines nationwide, large renovations are increasing. Mr. Hines expects the number will continue to grow over the next few years as more buildings constructed during the building boom of the 70's and 80's begin to age. Changes in building codes and new technology also make buildings obsolete and help spur the renovation boom, Mr. Hines said.
RENOVATIONS also are easier to finance than new construction because lenders consider them safer investments. Moreover, renovation costs about half as much as new construction.
The cost of the Shell renovation in Houston, which involves a total of 1.7 million square feet of space in the two buildings, is about $56 per square foot. New construction in downtown Houston (not including land acquisition) now runs from $100 to $120 per square foot, according to Mr. Hines.
The renovation, which began in August and is scheduled for completion late 1994, includes asbestos removal, new elevators and air-handling systems, installation of sprinklers, fire alarms and fittings for handicapped people and upgrading all public spaces.
The New York office of the architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill is handling the renovation. The firm's Chicago office designed the sleek travertine-sheathed towers, which were built in 1971 and 1972.
The Shell Oil Company renewed its lease for 25 years for 1.1 million square feet of space in the two buildings, both of which have been virtually 100 percent occupied since their opening, according to Ann McGonigle Kifer, Hines vice president in charge of corporate communications.
During the renovation, she said, tenants are being relocated temporarily to a floor cleared for that purpose. Ms. Kifer declined to discuss Shell's leasing terms. Prime downtown space goes for about $14 a square foot.
Hines Interests has retained ownership of 20 percent of the Shell Plaza buildings. Deutsche Bank of Frankfurt, controls the remaining 80 percent.
The Shell Plaza buildings were Mr. Hines's first major high-rise development. At the time of its completion, the 50-story 1 Shell Plaza was the tallest building in the South and the tallest reinforced concrete structure in the world.
Mr. Hines, who was born in Gary, Ind., moved to Houston in 1948 with an engineering degree from Purdue University to work for an air-conditioning company. After building small projects on the side for several years, he started his own construction business in 1957. He began building small industrial warehouse centers in Houston's outlying areas and later moved on to office, apartment and retail projects.
IN 1974, Mr. Hines received national attention with the construction of Pennzoil Place in downtown Houston. The bold design by Philip Johnson and John Burgee of a pair of 36-story trapezoidal towers with pointed tops won international design awards.
The ensuing publicity and financial success of Pennzoil Place led Mr. Hines to select not only Johnson and Burgee but also other leading architects, among them I. M. Pei, Cesar Pelli and Kevin Roche, to design his structures.
But while innovative design has been part of the Hines formula for success, it is the company's conservative financial policies that have enabled it to weather the current national real estate slowdown. Hines projects are all built with the backing of financial partners such as life insurance companies and foreign institutions like Deutsche Bank and Shell pension funds that retain large equity positions. And construction does not begin on a Hines project until major tenants are lined up.
Hines projects currently under construction include a 50-story, one million-square-foot office building in downtown Detroit; a 35-story, 750,000-square-foot office building in Louisville, Ky.; a 40-story, one million-square-foot office tower above the restored Grand Central Post Office in New York City; a historic renovation of a 950,000-square-foot office building on Capitol Hill in Washington and three five-story buildings that will be the headquarters for Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Group in Princeton, N.J.

IN the 80's it was "Karate Kid." Before that it was David Carradine's "Kung Fu." But today it is the Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtles who are sending their fans to the local martial arts school.
This rough and tumble world of martial arts schools and studios -- dojos to the initiated -- is one of the most fragmented segments of the highly fragmented health and fitness industry. Exactly how large it is remains open to debate. 
 Nicholas Cokinos, chairman of the Educational Funding Company, a Bethesda, Md.-based management and billing company that handles the finances of 500 martial arts clubs in the United States and Canada, estimates that the martial arts industry produces annual revenues -- mostly from monthly fees for instruction -- of between $720 million and $900 million.
But Fred Villari, president of Fred Villari Studios in Dedham, Mass., the country's largest chain with 123 franchise studios, estimates that the market is much larger. "The market for equipment alone is $2 billion," Mr. Villari said. He said the industry earns about $2 billion a year from lessons, though there is no way to verify his calculations.
Estimates also vary when it comes to the number of schools. Mr. Villari says about 4,000. But Peak Performance, a market research newsletter for health and athletic clubs published in Bellevue, Wash., estimates that there are 7,000. That number, the newsletter says, represents growth of 11 percent in the last two years, while the overall health club market has remained flat. The 7,000 schools include Y.M.C.A.'s that offer martial arts classes.
 
Warring Styles
Few Rules Govern A Splintered Sport
 The martial arts label is broadly applied and includes more than a dozen different disciplines or "forms," including karate, judo, taekwondo and kung fu, all of which trace their origins to Asia. Anyone can rent a room in a strip shopping center or an urban store front and hang a martial arts studio shingle. There are no formal industry associations and few formal sanctioning bodies to monitor or govern the field.
Few schools teach pure forms, preferring instead to teach a mix of the traditional martial arts. As a result, there are no longer any hard and fast definitions of a fighting style; nor are there any restrictions on opening a school, putting on a tournament or awarding the various belts that signify an individual's accomplishments.
"Any promoter can have an event and call it a world championship," said Michael James, publisher of Black Belt, the largest martial arts magazine.
Practitioners of one form commonly deride the others. There is the soft style versus the hard, and hybrids with official sounding names like Jeet Kune Do, Wing Chun or Hapkido. Many were created by black belt instructors seeking their own fame and a piece of the action.
"How does a customer know what they are going to get when they look for a school?" said Mr. James. "That's a question we've been asking for 30 years."
 
Paying to Learn
Fees for Classes And for Each Belt
 Even small studios can turn a tidy sum. According to Mr. Cokinos, the schools generate an average of $15,000 in revenues monthly from student fees that range from $55 to $65. Children's fees are generally $40 to $45 per month. The schools often sell equipment; uniforms sell for about $18, while head, hand and foot gear can cost as much as $40.
Martial arts schools also charge testing fees of up to $25 each time a student tries to qualify for a higher belt. While students in Japan, Korea or Taiwan are usually classified as white or black belts (novice or expert), in the United States each belt comes with a testing fee, and, not surprisingly, there are a range of hues, from white to yellow to purple to black.
Mr. James estimates that there are two million to three million serious martial arts enthusiasts in the United States. Upsurges in interest often follow exposure in the media, most recently via the ubiquitous Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtles. Martial arts performers like Bruce Lee, Chuck Norris, Jean-Claude Von Damme and Steven Seagal have ridden their skills to movie-star cult status, and operators of dojos have happily tagged along on their coattails.
But there is disagreement on whether martial arts studios are hurt in an economic downturn. Jhoon Rhee, who runs a chain of 12 studios in the Washington area and licenses his name and fighting style to 50 studios around the country, said the recession brought a 10 percent decline in revenues last year.
Mark Grupposo, a vice president at the Fred Villari chain, said troubles with unstructured management and lack of controls forced Villari to downsize over the last two years, either closing or selling more than 75 schools to bring its total to 123.
"There were some people mismanaging a few schools and they were fired," he said. "And we sold 50 studios to someone on the West Coast. We have tightened controls and we are slowly building up again." He said the company had revenues of $12 million last year, up 20 percent from the year before. The company is privately held and does not report financial performance.
 
The 'Karate Kids'
Ninja Turtles And Some Serenity
 Steven Schiff, a second-grader from Manalapan, N.J, spends three afternoons a week at Taekwondo Plus, a dojo down the street from his home. "I like the Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtles and they do karate, so I decided to see what it was like," he said. "Plus, I wanted to learn to defend myself if I got into a fight."
According to Mr. Cokinos, Steven is prime material for martial arts schools: 40 percent of the students are between the ages of 7 and 14; another 25 percent are 14 to 25.
While such things as the Ninja Turtle craze have sparked adolescent interest, dojo operators and others in the industry credit growth in the last 15 years to a switch in emphasis away from violence and toward discipline and a serene outlook, appealing to parents as well as kids.
Steven, reflecting this trend, said he must show his taekwondo instructor a note from his teacher verifying his grades in order to receive stars on his white belt. And before each session, he and his karate class recite vows not to misuse their skills.
Martial arts schools also market themselves by sponsoring competitions, often with official-sounding names. The Villari chain, for example, sponsors four regional tournaments each year and a large international competition. It expects 6,000 to 7,000 spectators for the international competition in Boston in May, each paying $6 to $8 for a ticket. Competitors will pay $25 and between 1,500 and 3,000 are expected.
Mr. Grupposo said costs for the competition will be about $25,000, with profits to be parceled out to the Villari studios. "It's a great motivational event," he said.
 
 
TRADITION AND COMPETITIVE PRESSURE
 Without industrywide standards, the martial arts community has little control over the quality of teaching and the awarding of belts.
Some schools, for example, are trying to cut the time it takes to achieve the coveted black belt in order to retain students. "I'm trying to create the teaching skills to do a black belt in one year," said Jhoon Rhee, owner of 12 taekwondo schools in the Washington area.
Two martial arts forms, taekwondo and judo, have governing bodies because they are Olympic sports. There is no requirement that schools join, but students with an eye on major competitions must take the organizations into consideration.
Some experts consider a black belt, and advancing from a 1st- to 10th-degree black belt, a lifelong pursuit. "I've been doing martial arts for 44 years and just achieved seventh degree," said Fumio Demura, a karate legend in Los Angeles who taught Chuck Norris, the film star, and performed the karate sequences for the "Karate Kid" movies.
Mark Grupposo, vice president of Fred Villari Studios in Dedham, Mass., is a seventh-degree black belt. He said Mr. Villari (10th degree) and the school's top instructors test students themselves and award the belts.
"Our system dates from 520 A.D.," Mr. Grupposo said. "There is a time-honored system of movements and a time frame for progress. It takes three to five years to get a first-degree black belt."
Others in the industry complain that proliferation is eroding a black belt's significance. "A 10th-degree black belt is supposed to be something honorary, something mystical," said Michael James, publisher of Black Belt magazine. "There are supposed to be only three in the country, but there are hundreds."

HEADLINE: RECORDINGS VIEW;
Cabaret Economics 101: Sing, Record, Then Hope

BYLINE: By JAMES GAVIN; James Gavin is the author of "Intimate Nights: The Golden Age of New York Cabaret."

 BODY:
The economics of cabaret today are so treacherous that most artists have to do almost everything themselves, including making records. Despite the success of Linda Ronstadt's and Natalie Cole's albums of standards, most cabaret singers find it impossible to interest a major label in their work. Those who want to record must either do so privately or sign with small companies -- notably DFG, Audiophile and the new Cabaret -- that care about a form of music whose artistic value exceeds its profitability. The singers may never make a cent in royalties, but the prestige of having a commercially available recording is more important.
Among recently released cabaret albums are titles by the female trio Betty, Jackie Cain and Roy Kral, Dixie Carter, Andrea Marcovicci, Amanda McBroom and Weslia Whitfield, a San Francisco-based singer who has created a profilic recording career through sheer determination. 
 Over the last decade, Miss Whitfield won acclaim from her hometown press. But when she began to solicit commercial labels, she found that a devoted cult following meant little to companies seeking million-selling artists. With her husband and accompanist, the English jazz pianist Mike Greensill, Miss Whitfield founded Myoho Records. To issue a recording in all three formats, she learned, would cost about $7,000. They raised the money, chose the songs and instrumentation, booked as much studio time as they could afford, hired a printer and pressing plant, then tried to get distribution. Tower Records in San Francisco bought large quantities, but, as Miss Whitfield reports, "Outside of San Francisco we have to resign ourselves to getting stores to take two or three at a time. We go there ourselves and try to convince the punk-rock guys who run the stores that they can sell our recordings."
By peddling the albums in clubs and by mail, Miss Whitfield and Mr. Greensill earn enough money each year to cover costs and make another album. Now Miss Whitfield records for Landmark, a small subsidiary of Fantasy, from whom she buys her own albums at wholesale prices to sell to fans. This has helped spread her reputation beyond San Francisco, with a happy consequence: next season she makes her debut at the Oak Room of the Algonquin Hotel in New York.
Miss Whitfield's albums capture much of the charm of her live performances, which substitute a touching simplicity for histrionics. The quality of her warm, burnished alto is matched by perhaps the most refreshing choice of standards and first-rate rarities since the jazz singer Chris Connor's recordings for Bethlehem and Atlantic in the 60's. Miss Whitfield's two Landmark albums, "Lucky to Be Me" (L-1524; CD and cassette) and "Live in San Francisco" (L-1531; CD and cassette), as well as three earlier titles, are available through Myoho Records (128 Bayview Circle, San Francisco, Calif. 94124).
Amanda McBroom took the same approach as Miss Whitfield, even though she began with wider renown. The singer and songwriter has performed in clubs ranging from the Roxy and Cinegrill in Los Angeles, her hometown, to the Russian Tea Room in Manhattan. She first won national attention in 1979 with her Grammy Award-winning title song for the film "The Rose," which was an immense hit for Bette Midler but failed to open doors for the songwriter as a major-label recording artist.
Six years ago, with her manager, Garry George, Miss McBroom formed Gecko Records. Her first solo album, "Dreaming," combined country, folk and pop influences with a theatrical flair inspired by her background in musical comedy. The album has sold 125,000 copies, earning back its high production cost of $70,000 three times over.
On her new album, "Midnight Matinee," Miss McBroom's richly passionate alto, at once sexy and maternal, is heard in several originals that surpass "The Rose" in emotional depth. Most of them are heartfelt pleas to hold out for romantic dreams. Both albums are available through Gecko Records (8370 Wilshire Boulevard, Suite 210, Beverly Hills, Calif. 90211).
One of the hippest new acts in cabaret has made a winning transition to record. Betty, a sassy trio from Washington D.C., is a musical counterpart of such female stand-up comics as Judy Tenuta, Joy Behar and Carol Siskind. The group's members -- Alyson Palmer and the twins Amy and Bitzi Ziff -- are tough, unsentimental urban women whose original songs take a hard look at sexual ambivalence, superficial bar chatter and other obstacles to romantic bliss.
A typical song, "First Date," mourns a failed effort to get beyond first base: "Well I guess I shaved my legs for nothing/ I never shoulda cleaned the tub or the sink/ You said goodbye to me downstairs/ You didn't even want that one last drink." Another, "Bicycle," teasingly depicts sexual options: "I just can't make up my mind which to ride/ Boys or girls/ Bicycles, that is." Their sardonic wordplay is framed by complex vocal arrangements. The group's debut album, "Hello, Betty" (issued on their own label, The Man From B.E.T.T.Y., Box 339, Cooper Station, New York, N.Y. 10276), contains 21 numbers, all with the group's own accompaniment on keyboards, electric bass and cello. Betty brings cabaret full circle to a time -- about 60 years past -- when its intention was to shatter convention and ruffle a few feathers. Their success offers proof that it is still possible to do just that.
Yet there is a great challenge in capturing an art that depends more on a performer's physical presence than on polished vocals. When cabaret artists are recorded live, some of that communicative spark can be preserved. While no album could fully catch the flamboyant Southern gusto of the singer and actress Dixie Carter in a nightclub setting, her recent "Dixie Carter Sings John Wallowitch -- Live at the Carlyle" (Vining/DRG LL9001; CD and cassette), has many incandescent moments.
A tribute to the esteemed cabaret performer who in 1963 was her first coach, the disk collects 15 examples of Mr. Wallowitch's verbal virtuosity and tongue-in-cheek sophistication. "This Moment," a ballad about the relentless passage of time, and "I See the World Through Your Eyes," a remembrance of Mr. Wallowitch's late brother Edward, become masterpieces of dramatic revelation in Miss Carter's hands.
Trying to adapt a nightclub act to the recording studio, however, can have disappointing results. The lack of an audience is keenly felt on four DRG collections by Julie Wilson devoted to the songs of Stephen Sondheim, Kurt Weill, Cole Porter and Harold Arlen. Miss Wilson feeds on the presence of her listeners, for whom her coarse, limited voice can express a lifetime of hard-earned experience. The cold impersonality of the studio inhibits her, bringing her vocal deficiencies into focus.
Miss Wilson can be heard to better advantage on "Cole Porter Revisited, Volume V," on Ben Bagley's Painted Smiles label (PS-122; CD only). The record is the latest in his series of collections of obscure gems by the great theater composers. Mr. Bagley's recent recordings also feature underrecorded cabaret artists like Sandy Stewart, Ann Hampton Callaway and Arthur Siegal. A complete catalogue is available from Painted Smiles Records, 74-09 37th Avenue, Suite 420, Jackson Heights, N.Y. 11372.
Even a live session cannot convey the appeal of Andrea Marcovicci, a regular at the Algonquin, the Gardenia in Los Angeles and other clubs. In person she exudes a contagious enthusiasm for her material, sprinkling it with breathless, witty patter on the foibles and stolen joys of 90's romance. Heard on record, however, her reedy neo-folk voice falls gratingly on the ear.
Miss Marcovicci has issued three recent albums -- "What Is Love?" (DRG 91401-2; CD and cassette), "Marcovicci Sings Movies -- Recorded Live at the Plush Room" (DRG 91405; CD and cassette) and "I'll Be Seeing You: Love Songs of World War II" (Cabaret CA 6001-2; CD only) -- in which her singsong phrasing, excruciatingly flat pitch and inadequate breath control destroy the charm of her choice repertoire. Miss Marcovicci's vocal failings are compounded by frequently rushed tempos and cluttered arrangements; several tracks on "What Is Love?" feature the infelicitous pairing of cello and saxophone.
By comparison, the new collection from the veteran vocal duo Jackie Cain and Roy Kral is a joy. Remarkably youthful and energetic after 44 years of performing, the couple straddles the line between jazz and cabaret so effectively that they are sometimes overlooked by both camps. Their style, which has changed little over the years, incorporates tight unison lines, occasional scat fills and a vocal blend that has lost none of its lustre.
"An Alec Wilder Collection" (Audiophile ACD-257; CD only), their 26th album, salutes an American artist. "While We're Young," "Moon and Sand," "The Lady Sings the Blues" and 12 other Wilder songs lovingly commemorate a songwriter who championed Miss Cain and Mr. Kral from the 50's until his death in 1980. Audiophile's catalogue is available from 1206 Decatur Street, New Orleans, La. 70116.
If cabaret is a synthesis of worldly experience and a childlike fascination with the whims of romance, then Jackie Cain and Roy Kral are among its most eloquent voices.

UNQUIET DAYS
At Home in Poland.
By Thomas Swick.
286 pp. New York:
Ticknor & Fields. $19.95. 
 THOMAS SWICK lived in Poland from 1980 to 1982, through the Solidarity revolution and after its suppression, and in this memoir he writes as one who has opted "to adopt the Poles as other writers had the Greeks." His book is framed as a literary appreciation of "the special character of people who live under harsher climates and regimes."
At the harshest moment of all, the declaration of martial law in December 1981, Mr. Swick goes to visit a Polish friend and finds him unexpectedly heartened: "You see, this is really the end of the myth of socialism. They've lost. There is nothing they can do to redeem themselves after this." When Mr. Swick observes that the pet hamster is "getting big," his friend replies, "he'll be meat for the winter." With fine journalistic self-effacement Mr. Swick, now the travel editor of The Fort Lauderdale Sun Sentinel in Florida, sets himself up as straight man to such displays of character in the face of political and economic tragedy. Under martial law he continues with his job as a teacher in the English Language College in Warsaw, surprised at first to find his Polish students in such strong spirits. His Polish wife gets the last word: "What are we supposed to do? Sulk?" "Unquiet Days: At Home in Poland" offers an intriguing picture of the details of daily life against a background of national crisis: we learn, for instance, that in December 1981 Polish television was showing "The Flintstones" every day.
The book's opening essay on Warsaw starts under "sullen skies" with the standard imagery of Iron Curtain Eastern Europe: "The city possessed a shabbiness that seemed to me heightened by its overcast sky." In "damp, dimly lit stores" one finds "cheerless produce," and the pathetic fallacy constantly comes into play. There are some fine observations as Mr. Swick watches the city from the windows of buses and trams, noting that the shops have no proper names: "I read in close succession, SHOES, CLOTHES, VEGETABLES, BOOKS -- signs that gave a street the somewhat nostalgic flavor of a storybook town in a grammar school reader." He comes to appreciate the city better as he turns from the shops to the shoppers, discovering that Warsaw was "the only city I knew where the women were more fashionable than the mannequins." There is also a rather charming chain of impressionistic associations with the names of Warsaw in different languages -- Polish, French, Yiddish, German, Russian -- though ending infelicitously with the observation that in English "Warsaw" is the city that "saw war."
There is an excellent piece on Mr. Swick's experience teaching English to Polish students. Here one gets a feel for his direct engagement as an American in Poland, telling his students about American high school life, about cheerleaders, about being chosen "most likely to succeed." One of the students comments, "And you tell Polish jokes!" It is here at the English Language College that Mr. Swick modestly experiences the Solidarity revolution; the teachers post their union demands: for instance, to reduce lessons from 50 to 45 minutes, and to be able to use American magazines in class. Mr. Swick's private pupils, outside the college, include the wife of a Japanese businessman in Warsaw: "I asked Mrs. Matsuda if she had heard of Walesa's claim that Poland could become a second Japan. She said politely that she thought it impossible." Mr. Swick watches his students taking their examination, and wonders about "their horribly uncertain futures." He rides the trams, and reads in people's faces "trauma and despair for the fate of the nation."
In the book's fascinating climactic piece Mr. Swick joins the nation on a walking pilgrimage from Warsaw to the shrine of the Black Madonna at Czestochowa. Marching out of Warsaw, he watches those who are watching him: "As the recipient of such an unexpected public outpouring of emotion, I was carried into a sort of ecstasy the likes of which I had never known before." The journalist-in-ecstasy is a somewhat suspect figure, and Mr. Swick, as a non-Catholic non-Polish pilgrim, never quite confronts what it means to seek one's ecstasies on other people's pilgrimages. He is not alone, for there are also Dutch, Belgian and French pilgrims -- and Italians, "kissing all the Polish girls." One of the Belgians remarks about the Polish pilgrimage: "We have nothing to compare to this at home. It's quite extraordinary, really, all these people, engaged in something like out of Old Europe." Clearly, this foreign experience of the pilgrimage is mediated by Western Europe's mythology of Eastern Europe.
Mr. Swick himself is caught up in this mythology as he marches, announcing "our departure from contemporary Poland, and our entrance into the sheltered and immemorial." A Polish village appears as "a make-believe hamlet of thatch huts and birch groves," like a model out of "natural history museums." Even in Warsaw Mr. Swick found that women in furs made him think of "the wild -- which seemed intoxicatingly near -- and a time (here, at least, not yet passed) when man by necessity clothed himself with its skins."
Though "Unquiet Days" may presume too much in offering entrance to time immemorial, it stands on much surer ground in its testimony to contemporary history. Apparently, the pace of history has outrun the pace of publishing, and this memoir of the Polish revolution of 1980-81 appears after the revolution of 1989. In fact, that earlier upheaval was intellectually charted with amazing speed; one has only to think of the superb work of foreign journalism and contemporary history of Solidarity by Timothy Garten Ash and the brilliant diaries of Kazimierz Brandys, so rapidly published in Polish and in translation. We must now take care not to overlook 1980 and 1981 as we seek to understand the significance of 1989; Mr. Swick offers a timely reminder to look back. Mr. Brandys in 1981 appreciated the awkwardness of Western Europe and America in the face of Poland's crisis: "It is not we but they who have a besieged-fortress mentality, and it is they who are drawing down the Iron Curtain within themselves." Today, when there is no longer an Iron Curtain without, books that speak from direct experience of Eastern Europe, like "Unquiet Days," can help us to confront the Iron Curtain within.

HEADLINE: 50 YEARS OF CROSSWORDS;
An Addict's Tale

BYLINE: By Jesse Green; Jesse Green is the author, with Meg Wolitzer, of "Nutcrackers: Devilishly Addictive Mind-Twisting Puzzles for the Insatiably Verbivorous" (Grove Weidenfeld).

 BODY:
WHEN I WAS STILL young enough to rise before my parents on Sunday mornings, I would run barefoot even in winter to the bottom of the driveway and lug in the loglike Times, which in those days came wrapped by the local distributor in colorful plastic bags left over from Wonder bread. Back in the house, I would peel away its outer sections -- the dread, perplexing news, the regimental financial tables -- to unfold the Magazine, so cold and flattened there in the middle that it hardly opened: the innermost bud. At once, I turned within it to the crossword, which was as yet promising and unfulfilled, like the day. For a boy from the suburbs of Philadelphia, the puzzle suggested the warrenlike mystery of New York City itself: a huge apartment block of tiny, numbered rooms, each with a uniquely apt, but missing, occupant.
I studied the puzzle carefully then, because it would be my last chance to see it unadulterated; indeed the adults were soon staggering in, coffee cup in one hand, pen in the other, ready to begin the ritual slaughter. For my father's method owed something to that of the weekend hunter: shoot at whatever moves first. He began the puzzle by answering as many Acrosses as possible, without reference to the Downs. Later, if the Downs contradicted his entries, he merely overwrote them. Occasionally he would call for help from my mother, whose answers, presumed accurate, were squeezed in faithfully, regardless of length. Within an hour the grid would be left an inky mess, half gibberish, half sense. "Finished!" my father would crow -- and indeed every last apartment was occupied: many, it seemed, by squatters. 
 I would survey the damage -- Diarist Anais? Why, Pin, of course -- and mourn for the mangled words strewn about. But on the other hand there was something deeply satisfying in the knowledge that errors as much as truths could be made to fit in the pattern. Everything has its place in a puzzle, and the place is communal. Solving means weaving the ups through the downs, the animals through the minerals, the obscure actresses through the dictators and czars until the whole world's trivia have been turned into a tapestry.
I wanted in. A family of economists in the neighborhood had bought a copier solely to solve the Sunday puzzle problem; the best we could do in my house was persuade my father to work his magic in pencil. That way, at least, I could come along later, busy myself cleaning the untidy room of his first attempts -- change "Pin" to "Nin" as necessary. But I could never make the whole thing right, and in that failure I discovered the true thrill inherent in the enterprise.
The thrill was pain. A crossword was not, like the rest of the paper, a monologue; it was a colloquy, albeit a sadomasochistic one. To solve the clues you bent your mind to the improbable patterns prescribed by the author. It hurt your head and was quite moving: Why, filling in crosswords, you actually got to write in the paper! There was something subversive about that act, and something democratic. A witty puzzle made it possible for anyone -- even a 10-year-old -- to contribute a witty weekly column to the hallowed New York Times.
For a while I was content with my father's leftovers, but becoming an adult means solving puzzles alone. If a crossword is a kind of weaving, eventually one must have a loom of one's own. What had delighted me as a child -- the symmetry, the rigidity, the honeycomb aura of industry -- was now less important than the task of filling in. In my own tiny, numbered New York apartment, I squinted and scrawled away Saturday night; what wasn't finished by midnight was looked up in the dictionary or thesaurus Sunday morning. I was calmed in some way by the weekly reassurance the completed grid provided: that mysteries were solvable, that the mind could grow itself toward answers through indirection and reward itself with joy.
But a sword lurks among the letters of "crossword," and a two-edged sword it is at that. To finish a puzzle, I observed, was to kill it. To solve is to dissolve, to make the enigma fade, and while the solution is satisfying, the enigma has its charms. And so, after a while, I put away the dictionary and thesaurus. Sometimes I only answered the Acrosses -- the Downs be damned! If some weeks I didn't manage to finish at all, well, that was fine, too; what was left unsolved would never be known -- which was just like life.
The Sunday Times puzzle has been my necessary fix for two decades now, but like the proverbial reefer that leads to a life of depravity, it prompted me to investigate darker vices. Or perhaps they came to investigate me. Lunching one day across the street from a movie theater, I watched in amazement as the word "cinema" transformed itself into "anemic" on the marquee. How cruel it seemed -- it must have been a marquee de Sade. Later, like a prodigal son, "iceman" would cometh to join the anagrammatic clan. It was useless to resist these visitations. Over the years, I had woven myself with the czars and emus into the web of words, and was now a prisoner within it.
I have not been in solitary confinement, at least. On New York subways, newspapers are opened as often as not to the crossword page. In England, cryptics have cultish followings. When a friend and I began writing American versions of the British puzzles for 7 Days, we found out what other puzzle makers already knew: that people are eager to be stymied, waiting to be bent. They crave so desperately the taste of another human mind that they are willing to be put through torture to get it. Though the taste is often salt, they come back.
I, TOO, COME BACK TO THE TIMES puzzle every weekend. Though I have long since been drawn into a life of advanced wordcrime, the original perpetrator retains its iconic glamour. No, it does not arrive like magic at the bottom of a driveway -- I pick it up from the corner newsstand now. But I still lug it home wrapped in a kind of transparent wonder, for it is as familiar to me as its answers are exotic. Everything is possible before you make your mark upon it, and even after. Come inside my New York apartment, it says: come visit a parallel Sunday universe of Aleuts and emus, yaks and Slavs, an odeon in which actress Merkel is starring forever in Capek's "R.U.R."; a fete where the drink is always ade, where the band's an octet and the tune's a rumba, where singer Edith is singing "You are ----" and Pin can dance with Nin all night long.

HEADLINE: Time to Reorganize Bloated Academia

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The budgetary problems of colleges and universities are, unfortunately, a consequence of a long overexpansion and reallocation of resources to "higher education," which began with the assumption that a college degree was the capstone of a complete education, to be made achievable for everybody. 
 This new vision had two immediate consequences: it devalued the high-school diploma, discarding the notion that blue-collar work was honorable and productive, and redirected students to seek professional academic careers regardless of ability.
In providing this new vision of educational achievement, resources were showered on expanding colleges and universities, inevitably leading to waste and bureaucratic bloat, while on the other hand less costly educational alternatives were rejected.
However, it is an economic truism that not everybody can have everything. Recent rises in tuition and costs are merely a reassertion of this old adage, which was long masked by the need for graduates in the economy's overexpanded service sectors. The relative success of community colleges shows how we can solve the problems of general public education and preserve the quality of our higher institutions of learning. The downsizing of colleges and universities should be accomplished by an immediate substantial raising of educational standards at all levels instead of financial restraints, and simultaneous introduction or expansion of alternative educational paths (apprenticeships, trade school), which will provide for the technical work force we so desperately need.
If we do this, we will restore on the one hand the value of a high school diploma and on the other we will curb the expansion of unneeded service careers. The process will undoubtedly be painful and extended, as any reallocation of resources always is, but as recent remarks from overseas make quite clear, it is absolutely necessary.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN;
Democrats Join in Assailing Bush In Final New Hampshire Debate

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Feb. 16

 BODY:
The five main Democratic Presidential candidates met tonight in a bland and largely anticlimactic debate that focused on their common opposition to President Bush, rather than the differences among their own prescriptions for the national economy.
Although it took place less than 48 hours before the New Hampshire primary, the first in the nation, and had thus been considered a potentially pivotal event, the encounter produced little fresh enlightenment for the voters of this state, tens of thousands of whom say they remain uncommitted. 
 Only on nuclear energy were there any real fireworks. His rivals ganged up on former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, the current leader in the New Hampshire polls, attacking his insistence that some use of nuclear power was unavoidable. Once they patronized him. Tonight, for just a moment, they shook his habitual calm.
 
A Sensitive Issue
 "Don't come at me," he warned them, insisting that he had been a committed environmentalist since the 1970's and remained steadfast. Mr. Tsongas had lost his temper about the same issue 10 days ago at Dartmouth College. The protracted controversy over the Seabrook nuclear plant in New Hampshire, which started operation in March 1990, has made it an issue of great sensitivity in the state.
All of the Democratic hopefuls laid into Mr. Bush, and Mr. Tsongas in particular kept saying the choice was not among Democrats but between the President and whomever the Democrats chose -- a classic leader's tactic, designed to preserve as much unity as possible for the fall campaign. Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska summed up the consensus with the comment, "No political figure in America is more indifferent to jobs than George Bush."
For much of the rest of the 90-minute debate, staged at St. Anselm's College just south of here and carried by the Cable News Network, the Democrats were content to recycle their campaign speeches and punch lines.
Politicians here and in Washington had expected Mr. Tsongas to be taken to task on substantive issues and Mr. Clinton to be attacked on questions of character. It didn't happen. Unchallenged, the Arkansas Governor chose not to comment, or was prevented by the format from commenting, on the accusations that turned his once free-flowing campaign into a nightmare.
Mr. Kerrey may have sensed that the event was providing less-than-gripping television viewing. When Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa mentioned Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, whose name is not on the ballot here, the Nebraskan commented with a smile: "Did you have to mention Governor Cuomo's name? Now more people will write him in." Two Chicagoans have started an unauthorized write-in campaign on Mr. Cuomo's behalf.
In the debate, the fourth of the young campaign, it was clear that the Democrats consider the President vulnerable on many issues.
 
Call for 'a Clean Break'
 Mr. Kerrey, who seemed more focused than he had in earlier broadcasts, said early that "our President has his head outside of the cold war, but his entire body is still in it." Mr. Tsongas said Mr. Bush lacked "a core of principle." Mr. Harkin called for "a clean break with Reagan and Bush trickle-down economics."
And Mr. Clinton declared, "We've got a President who doesn't believe we need a national economic plan."
Earlier in the day, the Democratic candidates had wrangled off-screen about taxes, abortion and questions of honesty and character.
Mr. Tsongas took on the Democratic leadership in Congress. Senator Harkin took shots at two of his rivals, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Kerrey, over their positions on abortion as well as on other issues. Mr. Clinton hit back at his critics, and Mr. Kerrey appeared to be trying to keep alive accusations of draft evasion leveled at Mr. Clinton.
Polls tracing the changes in voter sentiment day by day showed Mr. Tsongas holding a solid lead over Mr. Clinton, Mr. Kerrey in third place by a narrow margin over Mr. Harkin, and former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California running well behind.
There were signs of stress in the campaigns of both Mr. Kerrey and Mr. Harkin as both sought to stave off possible elimination from the race.
After Mr. Kerrey's longtime poll- taker and strategist, Harrison Hickman, acknowledged anonymously sending a memorandum critical of Mr. Clinton's draft record to journalists, Mr. Kerrey disavowed him and said he was not, at least for the time being, working for the campaign. Mr. Kerrey added, "He betrayed me."
The Harkin campaign approved and paid for a hard-hitting flier, circulated by a women's group, implying that Mr. Clinton and Mr. Kerrey were less than firm in their support of abortion rights. Among other things, the handbill asserts that Mr. Kerrey ran for Governor in Nebraska in 1982 as an opponent of abortion and that Mr. Clinton signed a bill in 1989 that requires young women seeking abortion to get parental consent first.
 
No 'Hollywood Women'
 In allusions to the accusations in a supermarket tabloid that Mr. Clinton conducted a 12-year extramarital affair, to Mr. Kerrey's relationship with Debra Winger and to Mr. Brown's romance with Linda Ronstadt, Mr. Harkin said in a speech to a labor group: "You won't be reading about me in the tabloids. I sure as heck won't be dating any Hollywood women."
Challenged about his tactics on the ABC news program "This Week," Mr. Harkin said, "I have a great deal of respect for Governor Clinton," but asserted that Mr. Clinton's conduct "raises questions in everyone's mind."
So much dirt had been thrown at him, Mr. Clinton replied, that he was "virtually a one-man landfill." He sought to turn the attacks made upon him into an advantage.
"One of the tests of a President is whether or not that man or woman can live with the pressure, take the heat and go on," he said. "I've learned some things about myself, I think, in the last couple of weeks, and I think the American people and certainly the people of New Hampshire know much more about me than anyone else."
 
Clinton as Outsider
 Mr. Clinton also sought to portray himself as the outsider, although he led the race here for weeks and won the endorsement of Democratic officeholders across the country. He suggested that Mr. Tsongas had always been the favorite here because he came from a neighboring state.
Mr. Clinton also railed against Washington. "You know, a lot of people in Washington may have given up hope on my campaign," he said, "but Washington has given up on the deficit. Washington has given up on the economy. Washington has given up on everything that's mattered for 10 years."
Mr. Tsongas rejected the middle-income tax cut that has been proposed by Democratic leaders in Congress, arguing that they would drop the idea if his campaign succeeds. Appearing on the NBC news program "Meet the Press," he said tax help for the middle class was needed but argued that his first job was stimulating the economy to create jobs, because if a working person was unemployed, "giving that person a tax cut is irrelevant."
"I'm not Santa Claus," Mr. Tsongas said, repeating a familiar campaign line. "If you want Santa Claus, you've got a lot of choices, Democrats and Republicans."
Mr. Bush's campaign manager, Robert M. Teeter, who was also interviewed on the ABC program, paid Mr. Tsongas a backhanded compliment with the remark that people were for him because he sounded like a Republican.
Alone among the major contenders, Mr. Kerrey avoided the television studios, campaigning instead at a suburban shopping mall and speaking at a rally in Manchester.
With him for the second time in eight days was Max Cleland, the former head of the Veterans' Administration, who lost both legs and an arm in Vietnam. Mr. Kerrey insisted that he was not trying to call attention to accusations that Mr. Clinton tried to avoid military service in Southeast Asia.

HEADLINE: Pentagon Imagines New Enemies To Fight in Post-Cold-War Era

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 16

 BODY:
In its first detailed military planning for the post-cold-war era, the Pentagon envisions seven scenarios for potential foreign conflicts that could draw United States forces into combat over the next 10 years, according to internal Pentagon documents.
Maintaining forces capable of fighting and winning one or more of the seven scenarios outlined in the documents would require a robust level of military spending into the next century. The documents suggest levels of manpower and weapons that would appear to stall, if not reverse, the downward trend in military spending by the mid-1990's. 
 The classified documents indicate that the leadership of the Defense Department has instructed the military chiefs to request forces and weapons sufficient to fight at least two large regional wars simultaneously, one against Iraq in the Persian Gulf and one against North Korea, while also being ready to conduct a major military campaign in Europe to prevent a resurgent Russia from pursuing expansionist aims.
 
Coups and Plots
 The document also says the United States should be prepared to respond to contingencies like a military coup in the Philippines that endangers the 5,000 Americans living there, or a "narco-terrorist" plot against the Government of Panama that threatens access to the Panama Canal, requiring both a Marine amphibious invasion and an airborne assault.
In addition, the documents call for a strategy to deter the re-emergence later in this decade of a global "adversarial rival" or "international coalition with an aggressive expansionist security policy." To do this, the United States would have to maintain a "technological" and "doctrinal" edge "and a credible capability to expand military forces."
The planning described in the documents does not mean that any of the conflicts described are inevitable or imminent, and the Pentagon itself calls the scenarios "illustrative" and "not predictive." Given current circumstances, many seem improbable. Iraq, for example, seems years away from rebuilding its military forces to the point where it could seriously threaten its neighbors with an invasion, although its remaining nuclear ability remains a source of concern.
 
Basis for Budget Planning
 But unlike the dozens of contingency plans the Pentagon develops for the use of American military forces abroad, the seven scenarios will serve as the foundation for long-range budget planning and determining the number and kind of troops and weapons the country should maintain. In recent history, such fundamental force and budget planning has usually occurred with each successive administration.
Congress, which ultimately sets the Pentagon budget, can challenge the Pentagon's planning assumptions and force changes by modifying military spending plans. Both could happen soon, since the scenarios are immediately relevant to the budget for next fiscal year that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney sent to Congress in January.
The 70 pages of planning documents were made available to The New York Times by an official who wished to call attention to what he considered vigorous attempts within the military establishment to invent a menu of alarming war scenarios that can be used by the Pentagon to prevent further reductions in forces or cancellations of new weapon systems from defense contractors.
For decades, American defense planning, centered on the Soviet threat, called for military forces capable of simultaneously fighting a major land war in Europe and a second, smaller war elsewhere, most likely in the Middle East or Asia. That plan was the driving force behind the continual growth in the Pentagon budget and the spending of hundreds of billions of dollars on new weapons.
 
Cutting Forces in Europe
 As that plan has grown obsolete, the United States has moved to reduce the number of American troops in Europe from 325,000 to 150,000, and the Pentagon plans to cut the overall size of the active-duty military by establishing a "base force" of 1.6 million men and women by 1995, down from the cold war level of 2.1 million. Some cutbacks are also planned in the most expensive new weapons systems, including the Seawolf submarine, which is to be canceled, and the B-2 Stealth bomber.
In budget terms, the Pentagon last month proposed cuts of $50 billion over the next five years. The Defense Department's proposed $281 billion budget for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 is $10 billion lower than the current spending plan.
The new documents, which could well shape military forces for years to come, indicate that while the Pentagon has abandoned planning for a superpower military confrontation after the collapse of the Soviet Union and end of the cold war, it is not yet prepared to consider drastically reduced force levels.
 
Role for the Navy
 Under the conflict scenarios, for example, the United States would need to keep aircraft carriers and their escort warships dispersed around the world to deal with potential trouble from the Baltic Sea to the South China Sea, a requirement that would support the Navy's assertion that it needs 12 carrier battle groups.
The scenarios were drafted over the last six months by a special group of military officers working under Adm. David E. Jeremiah, the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. While the scenarios are described as "illustrative" in the classified documents, they reflect the thinking of the military chiefs on what kind of regional wars are likely, or at least prudent to plan for, to keep the United States military ready and capable to respond.
In each major conflict studied, the Pentagon planners concluded that American forces should be prepared to encounter assaults from nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, which would be unlikely to come into play unless a desperate regional foe saw the use of such weapons as a last resort to forestall catastrophic defeat.
The new scenarios, however, like similar planning documents dating back to the Kennedy Administration, do not address the possibility of all-out nuclear warfare with strategic nuclear weapons, since that is less a question of budgetary planning than of national survival strategy.
Gen. Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, referred to the scenario study in remarks to reporters on Feb. 4, but provided few details about them. He said the scenarios did not refer to specific countries as potential adversaries for planning purposes, but the documents indicate otherwise.
A Feb. 4 memorandum accompanying the scenarios instructed the secretaries of the military departments in the Pentagon that "these draft scenarios should be used" in the preparation of each service's spending plans for the 1994-1999 budget years. The memorandum was sent by David S. C. Chu, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Program Analysis and Evaluation, acting on behalf of Defense Secretary Cheney.
The scenarios, usually included in a document known as the defense planning guidance, were issued separately this year because the formal guidance document is months behind schedule due to rapidly unfolding events in the former Soviet Union. These scenarios are expected to be incorporated in the guidance document when it is completed next month.
 
Logistic Ability
 General Powell, in his remarks on Feb. 4, said the scenarios "helped us size the force and also more importantly, size the power projection capability" needed to move troops, tanks and artillery on transport aircraft and cargo ships to distant potential war zones.
In addition, the scenarios assume a major role for the American military in coming years even though the nature of American economic and military power, and how they should be employed in the pursuit of global American interests, remains very much under debate.
Some important voices have called for greater emphasis on economic power, productivity and investment as a way to nurture greater stability in the world. Others have argued that even after cutting America's cold war military roughly in half, the United States still would be the pre-eminent military power in the world.
For some members of Congress, the scenarios in an election year undoubtedly will provide a compelling argument to keep open defense production lines that otherwise would be slated for closing.
 
Challenges in Congress
 But the scenarios are also likely to encounter significant challenges in Congress, since many lawmakers say the time has come to rethink the size of the Pentagon budget, and are likely to take issue with some of the political assumptions underlying the scenarios.
For instance, a number of analysts have forecast that Iraq will remain economically devastated well into the next century, thus lacking the resources to launch and sustain a major military campaign outside its borders. Likewise on the Korean Peninsula, the onset of peace negotiations is rapidly reducing the prospect for conflict, they say.
Military planners often insist that they must address military capabilities of potential adversaries and not political trends that could be reversed. But with the end of the cold war, the probability of major conflicts that would require American military intervention is diminishing rapidly in the view of many analysts.
 
Naming the Foes
 The specific identification of possible enemies in the illustrative scenarios is in sharp contrast to recent public statements by General Powell. In his Feb. 4 remarks, General Powell said his staff's examination of "three major regional conflict scenarios" did not identify specific countries as potential adversaries.
"We're trying not to do that because I can't do that, that well, any longer," he said, "but I know the neighborhoods they live in."
General Powell's public remarks may have reflected the political sensitivity over postulating, in classified documents, conflicts with Iraq, North Korea and Russia and coups in Panama and the Philippines, even though doing so may have provided a useful basis for the military to test through planning exercises whether United States forces would be up to the task of getting to the war zone quickly with adequate troops and weapons to achieve a decisive victory.
A preface to the war scenario study says it "reflects a shift in planning focus from a single monolithic global scenario to an array of regional scenarios."
"Although changing world events make the inclusion of some individual scenarios arguable, all are useful for planning under the new strategy," the preface adds.
Pointing out that the scenarios are intended to be "illustrative," the preface adds, "they are neither predictive or exhaustive. Rather they depict plausible future events illustrating the types of circumstances in which the application of U.S. military power might be required."

HEADLINE: Americans Giving Up Their Leisure Time

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 16

 BODY:
The average American worker puts in about 140 more hours on the job in a year than two decades ago, says a study that also found that paid days off have dwindled.
It all adds up to a major crimp on leisure time, say two economists for the Economic Policy Institute, a research group that is financed by labor unions, foundations and corporations. 
 "Americans are starved for time," the study said. "Increasing numbers of people are finding themselves overworked, stressed out and heavily taxed by the joint demands of work and family life."
The study was written by Juliet Schor of Harvard University and Laura Leete-Guy of Case Western Reserve University.
The study found that full-time workers put in, on average, 138 hours more a year in 1989 than they did in 1969.
Paid time off -- vacations, holidays, sick leave and personal days -- fell roughly 15 percent in the 1980's, the study said. Americans had an average of 16.1 days off a year in 1989, down from 19.8 days in 1981, according to the study. In most European countries, workers have paid vacations of at least five weeks, it said.
The decline of real wages since 1973, coupled with the increased costs of health care and housing, are pushing Americans to put in more hours, the institute said.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Republicans;
ECONOMY SHADOWS BUSH'S CAMPAIGN

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOLLIS, N.H., Feb. 16

 BODY:
President Bush today wound up a weekend of campaigning intended to supercharge his re-election bid with a show of Presidential strength. Instead, he confronted skeptical voters and lingering doubts about his economic plan and went home still on the defensive against Patrick J. Buchanan, his conservative challenger.
Much of the extra campaign time that his staff scheduled to give voters a closer look at their President was spent explaining why he had not yet delivered on a promise he made in the State of the Union Message to press for a new tax break.
 
Upbeat Despite Small Crowds
 Despite weeks of trying to sell his ideas for ending the recession and addressing middle-class concerns, Mr. Bush continued to hear questions about unemployment, a sluggish economy and the growing costs of health care. 
 The crowds were small at some of Mr. Bush's campaign events, and there were often bigger ovations for Barbara Bush and the actor Arnold Schwarzenegger than for the President himself. At two rallies on Saturday that were intended to kick off the final push to Tuesday's primary, supporters had to be bused in from neighboring Massachusetts.
Mr. Bush, who is favored to win both the New Hampshire primary and the Republican nomination, stayed upbeat, telling voters to be proud about America's accomplishments and not to listen to his critics. "I have a plan and they don't have a clue," he told a rally in Derry.
But it was clear that Mr. Buchanan's attacks on the tax issue were getting to voters, and the candidate who made "read my lips, no new taxes" the linchpin of his 1988 campaign found himself hard-pressed to explain why he was not pressing for immediate passage of the new tax break he proposed last month.
The proposal, for a $500 increase in the tax exemption for each dependent child, was included in the large, longer-term economic-recovery bill Mr. Bush sent to Congress. But it was not in the list of seven measures that he considers the most urgent and wants enacted before March 20, and the omission has become a focus of Mr. Buchanan's campaigning.
Complaining about "attack dog" campaigning, Mr. Bush vowed at almost every stop that he would fight for the tax break this year. He waved a copy of his larger bill over his head and said in tones of increasing anxiety, "It's in there."
Bush aides argued that the tax break would not take effect until next year and was never intended to be part of Mr. Bush's short-term relief program. But by today, it was at the top of Mr. Bush's list again as he described his economic-recovery plan. Instead of overwhelming Mr. Buchanan, the Bush campaign was still trying to manage expectations for Tuesday's vote so that however well Mr. Buchanan does, it can present the President's showing as a major victory.
And Mr. Buchanan, whose insurgent campaign has been filling the airwaves with alternating images of Mr. Bush making his 1988 pledge and his promise this year to increase the child exemption, mocked Mr. Bush's explanations.
With the first Presidential primary just two days away, the tempest over taxes emerged as a new example of the way the Bush campaign has seemed to gallop ahead of the tactical abilities of the White House and campaign teams.
From both parties here, the early reviews of the Bush political team were negative and carried a tone of surprise that the Republican organization seemed to have lost the edge that helped Mr. Bush rally in this state virtually overnight in 1988 and then dominate the general election.
"The fundamental problem is that we have remained reactive and after all this back and forth, we neither have a very strong message of our own, nor have we really discredited the opponents', and that is a bad situation to go into primary day with," a senior Republican adviser said.
For Mr. Bush, the weekend was another chance to persuade voters that he has compassion for their economic problems and to touch political bases.
 
'Real Personal Basis'
 Mr. Bush visited a synagogue and Bishop Leo O'Neil of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Manchester on Saturday. Today, he went to services at the First Congregational Church in Nashua. He later took questions from voters in a floodlit gymnasium, perched on a stool on a small stage that was surrounded by red velvet ropelines, a setting that looked for all the world like a tiny boxing ring.
Mr. Bush brushed away a suggestion that he was out of touch by reminding his audience that his daughter Robin had died of leukemia in the early 1950's. "Want me to put this on a real personal basis for you?" he said. "Barbara and I lost a child. Some people here haven't done that. I wouldn't suggest that if that experience hadn't come to your family that you would be less concerned about a neighbor who went through it."
Mr. Bush also offered a taste of his wandering syntax as he denounced Government waste. "I'm all for Lawrence Welk," he said. "Lawrence Welk is a wonderful man. He used to be or was, or wherever he is now, bless him. But you don't need $700,000 for a Lawrence Welk museum when we've got tough times and people in New Hampshire are hurting." (Mr. Welk is still alive.)
Bush aides said there were divisions within the campaign over two tactical decisions Mr. Bush had made in New Hampshire. One was to refrain from mentioning Mr. Buchanan by name or mounting any direct assault on his campaign.
The other was to unveil a new theme on the last weekend before the primary: for the past two days, Mr. Bush has been arguing that the primary is too serious to cast a protest vote for Mr. Buchanan. "We're not in this for messages; we're in this to see who should be chosen to be President and bear the full responsibility for that job," Mr. Bush said at a pancake breakfast in Nashua this morning.
Some Republicans argued that Mr. Bush's decision to avoid direct confrontation would not have the desired effect of diminishing Mr. Buchanan but instead would leave the impression that he was, as one adviser put it, "too scary to mention."
Officials said this approach, along with the decision to leave the child tax-exemption increase for later, was driven by a basic belief that Mr. Buchanan's successes here are not a reflection of his own popularity.

HEADLINE: Remnant of the War on Poverty, Job Corps Is Still a Quiet Success

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif.

 BODY:
After Alisa Campbell quit school in the ninth grade, she hung out at home with her grandmother, mother and sister, watched soap operas all day and lived off a welfare check.
After Thomas Helton dropped out of school, at about the same age, he flipped hamburgers at Burger King, quit because it was clear that only chumps worked for a living, and devoted himself to getting high, picking fights and trying to stay out of jail. 
 Ms. Campbell and Mr. Helton were part of a growing army of American young people so uneducated, unskilled, undisciplined and unsocialized that they often cannot keep jobs even if they are lucky enough to get them.
Unemployed and some say unemployable, they swell America's welfare rolls, fill its jails, bear its illegitimate children, terrorize its cities and raise concerns about its ability to compete in the international marketplace.
But Ms. Campbell and Mr. Helton have since taken a higher road than many of the nation's five million impoverished young men and women. They are model students at a Jobs Corps center here, one of 106 campuses across the nation that inconspicuously carry out a mission that dates back to 1964, when President Lyndon B. Johnson began the war on poverty and set about transforming some of America's most disadvantaged 16- to 22-year-olds into skilled, responsible workers.
Job Corps has had its ups and downs. It was slashed in the Nixon years, when it was called a wasteful extravagance, and was threatened with extinction during the Reagan Administration, when the President snidely compared the program's cost to that of Harvard University. But other critics are few and far between.
Students of Job Corps are its best advertisement, recruitment posters made flesh.
Today Ms. Campbell, an 18-year-old from Los Angeles, is working toward her high school equivalency diploma, studying computer programming, learning to get out of bed when the alarm rings and "controlling my attitude."
Mr. Helton, a 20-year-old from San Diego, is nearly done with his training in building maintenance, earns extra spending money as a leader in his Job Corps dormitory and says he now knows how to avoid drugs and get along with others.
Larry Deisler, the director of the Sacramento center, said: "I almost get goosebumps thinking of what we can do for these kids. And they're lost people otherwise."
 
Success Out of the Limelight
 Job Corps, a mix of vocational training, boarding school and boot camp, is widely hailed for its effectiveness and cost-efficiency, a Federal program that actually works. But despite rare consensus from government officials, elected leaders, economists and social scientists across the ideological spectrum, the program, which serves 62,000 young people a year, gets scant attention and struggles to hold its own in the annual budget minuet on Capitol Hill.
"The single most important social policy issue facing this country is what to do about disadvantaged youth," said Gordon Berlin, a senior vice president at the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation in New York City, which evaluates and develops social programs. "Job Corps is the only thing that seems to make a difference. This is right under our noses, and it's surprising to me we haven't given it more time or attention. It's a very valuable resource we could draw on. Why not double Job Corps?"
Proposals have lately been made to do something close to that. The National Commission on Children, a bipartisan study group appointed by the President and Congress, recommended last year that 10 new centers be opened immediately, at a total cost of $160 million, and 10 more each year for the next four years. And a coalition of organizations led by the National Association of Home Builders and the Childrens' Defense Fund is calling for 50 additional centers by the year 2000, an expansion expected to cost $1.16 billion.
But the Bush Administration's 1993 budget proposal, which sharply increases spending for Head Start, the other crown jewel of President Johnson's Great Society, seeks to interrupt an expansion of Job Corps. Six new centers had been authorized by Congress, with three of them near completion. The Bush budget redirects money from building the other three centers to maintaining old ones, asking for $910 million for Jobs Corps in the next fiscal year, down slightly from 1992.
"If we had the money, we would expand in a heartbeat," said Carolyn Goldberg, deputy assistant secretary for employment and training in the Department of Labor, which administers Job Corps. "But this is the only way we can see to maintain the quality of the program and live within the current spending ceilings."
 
A Savior in Orrin Hatch
 The biggest threat to the program came early in the Reagan Administration, when the President tried to eliminate it. The program's savior was Senator Orrin G. Hatch, a Utah conservative who is the ranking Republican on the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee.
Mr. Hatch said he became a convert to the Job Corps after his first visit to a center in his home state. "They take the worst of the worst and really help these kids," he said. "They get substitute parental training. They get taught values, responsibility, honesty, the kind of discipline that comes from working and the kind of pride that comes from being able to support yourself."
R. Sargent Shriver, who ran the war on poverty in the Johnson Administration, also cites the values of hard work, spartan living, self-respect and respect for others that are taught at Job Corps centers, where students endure curfews and dress codes, sleep in bunks in crowded dormitories and hang awards and inspirational messages on their bulletin boards.
"You don't come from your mother's womb with discipline," Mr. Shriver said. "You have to be brought up. That's what Job Corps does -- belatedly."
 
Refashioning Teen-Agers
 While Job Corps students are mastering work skills, they are also acquiring habits missing in their chaotic homes and neighborhoods.
"Some of these kids, if you saw them on the street, you'd move to the other side," said Lee M. Mathews, director of the South Bronx center. "Much of America considers them bad kids. But when you deal with them on a day-to-day basis, you realize they want discipline and guidance."
Mr. Mathews recalled summoning one student to his office for a chat: "He looked like a thug. He had this, you know, this street walk." The director gestured with his elbows, demonstrating the roll walk popular with teen-age boys in New York City.
"I told him: 'The name of this place is Job Corps. The idea is to get a job. Do you know what America thinks of that walk? They think it's violent. It's intimidating. We don't do that here.' "
Mr. Mathews watched the boy over the next few weeks struggling to walk as instructed, to swing his arms just the right amount. Then he called him in again.
"Mr. Mathews, I'm trying, I'm trying," the boy pleaded.
"I know," the director replied, "and I just wanted to say I'm proud of you."
Some young people who arrive at Job Corps had no respect for property, like Chad Daniels, 17, a student at the center in Joliet, Ill., who said he was kicked out of school in the ninth grade.
"Before, if somebody came up and handed me a radio, I really wouldn't care if I broke it," said the teen-ager, a nervous young man, reluctant to look anyone in the eye. "Now I wouldn't do that."
Others had never been comforted in times of trouble.
Reinaldo Colon, 25, a 1989 graduate who is now a police officer in the Bronx, recalled when a classmate was shot to death outside the spiked fence of the center, not an unusual event in the neighborhood and the sort of thing he had shrugged off while growing up.
But Mr. Mathews called a meeting. "I remember his making a speech about how we needed to be careful out there," Mr. Colon said. "He was crying like it was his own son. I was new, but I thought, 'This guy really cares.' "
 
Training and Jobs
 Job Corps was a ragged operation in its early days, long on good intentions about removing young people from the ghettos and hollows but short on strategies that worked. But it survived and matured, replicating things that succeeded and discarding those that did not.
What evolved, many experts say, is a unique partnership between the Federal Government, which sets the program guidelines, private corporations, which run the centers, and unions and trade groups, which train the students and help them find work.
Entrants to Job Corps are lured by recruiting posters and broadcast advertising and by social workers. The academic curriculum allows students to progress at their own pace in reading and math, while they learn basic social and workplace skills, like how to handle criticism and how to act at a job interview. A high school equivalency diploma is the goal. The average length of stay at a center is about 10 months.
According to Job Corps, which tracks former students for six months, 67 percent of the graduates get jobs and 17 percent go on to higher education. These percentages include the nearly 4 in 10 students who quit the program in the first three months or are kicked out for infractions like using drugs or carrying a weapon. And according to a 1983 study by Mathematica Policy Research Inc. of Princeton, N.J., Job Corps returns $1.46 for every dollar spent, because of increased tax revenue and decreased welfare, crime and incarceration costs.
The only bad thing anyone seems to say about the program is that it is expensive: $18,831 to educate, house and outfit one student for a year. At Harvard, to use President Reagan's comparison, tuition, room, board, fees and books come to $23,161 a year.
But proponents of the program say different calculations are more to the point, say the cost of a year in a juvenile detention center or a residential drug treatment center. The former costs $29,600, on average, according to the Justice Department; the latter $19,000 for teen-agers, according to Phoenix House, which runs drug programs nationwide.
 
The Great Worry
 The prospect of imprisonment or addiction no longer looms large for successful Job Corps students. But they talk incessantly about those who spend a lifetime working at a fast-food restaurant or a convenience store.
Candace Ellisor, who had been thrown out of the house by her mother and was living in a homeless shelter when she saw a Job Corps recruiting poster, is now vice president of the student government at the Sacramento center, has mastered carpentry, building maintainence and landscaping and plans to be a millwright.
But as she approaches graduation, Ms. Ellisor grieves for her friends who are stuck working at a convenience store, praying for a 50-cent-an-hour raise and fearing they will be dismissed the first time they make a mistake.
"Bosses don't make money teaching you how to do things," she said. "They're not baby sitters. They expect you to understand how to work. I wish we had more programs like this so they all wouldn't have to go from one $4-an-hour job to another."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Democrats;
Brown, Seeing His Role as Savior, Runs to 'Take Back America'

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Feb. 16

 BODY:
Edmund G. Brown Jr. sees himself as a savior, his cause summed up in the title of the half-hour documentary-style political commercial that he is presenting to New Hampshire voters on cable television: "Take Back America."
So despite what naysayers argue or what public opinion polls show, Mr. Brown, the former Governor of California, is out on the hustings, pushing his anti-money, anti-big politics messages with the fervor of a plaid-shirted evangelist. 
 He does not want to speculate about the polls, who is ahead, who is behind, and whether he has any chance of becoming the Democratic nominee. This is all "a game set up by the corrupt political system and the media" that he continually inveighs against, he said in a recent interview.
 
'I'm in It Until the End'
 "I'm in it until the end," he said. "I'm going to Maine, Maryland. I have a full slate of Maryland delegates. My strategy is to present as clearly as I can the truth of our condition in the world."
Mr. Brown is outraged and offended, ready and willing to wrench democracy away from the forces of corruption that he contends have captured it, though those same forces are the ones that once bankrolled the campaigns that made him a two-term Governor of California, from 1974 to 1983.
Mr. Brown is consumed with a desire to serve whether anyone in the political establishment wants him to or not, because, he said, "People are coming up to me and beseeching me to do this."
Mr. Brown, who once wrote that he was both attracted and repelled by politics, says he has long been keenly interested in changing the political process. When he first ran for governor in 1974, he campaigned on an anti-lobbyist, anti-big-contribution platform. His latest crusade was born, he said, of his experience as chairman of the California Democratic Party from 1989 to 1991, when he said he discovered that "greed for money" ran the political system at the expense of ordinary citizens.
And he has tried to tap into the general disgruntlement with politics-as-usual with his insurgent campaign, his "800" number for contributions and limitation on donations at $100. Although Mr. Brown trails in public opinion polls, his campaign stops in the civic centers, living rooms and school auditoriums of dark, snowy towns and cities in New Hampshire, come with an enthusiastic, foot-stomping ring.
Mr. Brown spoke earlier this month in Laconia, N.H., at a town meeting in an old factory that is now the state meeting house. Standing on the rough wooden floors, Mr. Brown managed to conjure the air of an old-fashioned New England revival, haranguing his audience about the responsibility to be Thomas Paine's "winter patriots" while painting horrific verbal pictures of corrupt politicians, bloated lobbyists and a tax system that is "a banquet feast of corruption."
"I've always been a believer in the progressive tax, but the tax keeps changing," said Mr. Brown, noting that President Bush is proposing another change in the system. His comments were greeted with applause.
Mr. Brown's own tax proposal is a 13 percent flat tax with only three deductions: for rent, home mortgage and charity. He said the change would keep everyone honest and not give any benefits to wealthy interests. Any loss from the present system, he said, would be made up with a value-added tax, a type of national sales tax.
His talk was strewn with ideas, figures and can-do affirmations. "I believe that we can create jobs," he said. "And we can create jobs now. The country does have the money."
And sprinkled throughout, there were always the assertion that things were not happening because of corruption in politics. "Lobbyists, money, deception, fraud, all of it, O.K., that happened," Mr. Brown said. "I'm here to break up that cozy arrangement."
He disparaged his rivals, hinting at the character questions hanging over Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, and deriding the plan by Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa to invigorate the economy with a highway building program. "We'll still be running Japanese cars down them," he said.
Mr. Brown deals with critics who say he is shrill and impractical by reminding his audience that as governor and an atypical politician, he was considered "a weird, alien being" for reducing his salary and driving a Plymouth instead of a chauffeured limousine.
"I paid my own rent out of my own salary," he said. "Pretty weird, huh?"
 
Fervor Seems Like a Calling
 During a question and answer period, a member of the audience asked why it had taken him nearly 20 years to see the faults in the political system and his culpability in it. Mr. Brown compared his position to that of St. Augustine, the North African bishop and saint who led a sinful life before recognizing the error of of his ways.
"I don't intend to become a bishop or a saint," Mr. Brown said. "I just didn't have the will or the insight to declare war on this corrupt incumbent establishment."
Wendy Wilson, a nurse from Gilford who came to the meeting with her two children, liked what she heard. "There's a need for a major overhaul," Ms. Wilson said. Is Mr. Brown the candidate to do it? "I wonder if anyone can do it," Ms. Wilson said.
At times, Mr. Brown's fervor seems almost like a calling -- perhaps a substitute for the priestly vocation abandoned by this ex-Jesuit seminarian?
"I wouldn't call it a call," he said. "That's something to think about. But it's a very powerful feeling."
And if he does not prove successful at the polls? Mr. Brown said he would continue his attacks on government and politics because "enhancing and preserving democracy won't disappear on Nov. 3."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Campaign Journal;
Democrats' Last New Hampshire Debate Becomes a Poise and Pose Contest

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Feb. 16

 BODY:
Tonight's debate among the Democrats was confusing and frustrating, but also revealing. It did not give viewers much sense of what policies the candidates stood for, but it provided a nice glimpse of how they reacted to adversity, of how they answered strange questions in the midst of chaos.
It began with a series of unnecessary videotaped pieces about the candidates and proceeded into a section that resembled two-against-one tennis: two questioners sending question after unrelated question against one candidate. Then the candidates took turns rambling on about whatever was on their minds, after which they delivered one-minute closing statements in the pious, rehearsed tones of schoolchildren in an American Legion essay contest. 
 Perhaps the most surprising performance of the night was that of the moderator, Bernard Shaw, who had made his mark in a 1988 debate by asking Michael S. Dukakis if he would support the death penalty for a man who raped and murdered his wife. Mr. Dukakis' unemotional answer was noteworthy, and Mr. Shaw's pointed question was called the most revealing of the campaign.
Tonight Mr. Shaw asked a series of questions that tended to be either unanswerable (What percentage of the gross national product should be spent on the environment?) or unfocused. His first question -- "What qualities should this nation's leader have?" -- might just as well have been, "Give us a little of your standard speech."
All five candidates eagerly complied and used the opportunity to come out strongly in favor of the environment, jobs and building for the future. They were against global warming, wasting energy and President Bush.
What was interesting was not what they said but how they did it. Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska turned in his best debate performance so far, looking more relaxed and sounding more coherent than in previous debates. When a questioner, Ken Bode of CNN, credited him with a line about other countries having won the cold war, Mr. Kerrey smiled and demurred.
"I'm afraid it was actually Paul Tsongas who said that the cold war's over and Japan and Germany won it," he said. "I wish I'd thought of that line. It's a great line." Later he had the grace to joke about the man no one wanted to think about: Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York.
 
Harkin Digresses
 Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa got the first question of the debate, and he tried to start with a thank-you speech to New Hampshire instead of a direct answer. He was interrupted by Mr. Shaw. Then, asked to specifically name issues where he disagreed with organized labor, which has supported his campaign, he digressed again and began attacking his opponents for accepting money from corporate executives.
Mr. Harkin was interrupted again, and it added to a very bad first impression. He had better moments later in the debate, but it must have been difficult for some viewers to forget that opening evasiveness.
Former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts spent much of the debate with pursed lips. He did not seem to be enjoying his status as the leader in polls in New Hampshire, and his dour expression was often matched by vague answers. He maintained some of his reputation for giving the painful truth by standing up against his rivals and supporting nuclear power, but at times he looked defensive.
Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas took advantage of the chaotic discussion to step in several times and try to play the great unifier or moderator, an effective ploy for looking Presidential. He suggested, for instance, that everyone explain how they planned to reduce the deficit, and that everyone come out in favor of America joining the rest of the world in an agreement to halt global warming.
Former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California started off the evening with a crisp discussion of tax rates, and seemed to be dispelling his image as the outsider railing at the establishment. But then he quickly went back to his old style.
"Look at the tax code," he complained, "all the loopholes, the ripoffs, the whole sort of what's going on in that Congress. They're spending half their time raising money, and the impact is we have millions of people out of work." He called for a "family bill of rights" that would guarantee "a living wage to every American, education, health care, food and shelter, and to be free of insecurity in their old age."
No one opposed these notions. Nor, when Senator Harkin called for a moratorium on foreclosing homes of people who had lost their jobs, did anyone raise the question of what such a policy would do to the willingness of banks to lend mortgage money. It was not that kind of a debate.

HEADLINE: Sheik a Hero to Shiites, a Symbol of Terrorism to West

BYLINE: By IHSAN A. HIJAZI, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIRUT, Lebanon, Feb. 16

 BODY:
The Party of God eulogized its secretary general, Sheik Abbas Musawi, as a martyr today, saying he died "in a vicious Zionist raid targeting his convoy." The party promised to escalate its holy war against Israel.
Sheik Musawi, 39 years old, died in an Israeli ambush as he returned from a rally in memory of a fellow party leader who was killed by Israeli commandos eight years ago. 
 The Sheik, whose wife, Siham, and 6-year-old son, Hussein, died with him, mentioned the possibility of death in a recent speech. "Our greatest appeal to Allah is, God bless us with martyrdom and honor us with it," he said to followers in Beirut's southern suburbs last week, Reuters reported.
Sheik Musawi, from the village of Nabih Chit near the ancient city of Baalbek, was elected secretary general of the party in 1990 and has been a leader of the group over the last decade.
During that time, in the eyes of the West, the party has been a symbol of state terrorism backed by Iran. The party has been characterized as an umbrella group for the Shiite Muslim organizations that took western hostages in Lebanon.
The Party of God leads the Islamic Resistance Movement, a coalition that has carried out hit-and-run attacks in Israel's self-proclaimed "security zone" in southern Lebanon.
The group's stated goal has been to drive Western political, cultural and economic influence from the Mideast and replace it with Iranian-inspired Islamic fundamentalist doctrine.
 
Foe of Peace Talks
 Among the objectives was scuttling the United States-sponsored Middle East peace talks, and to that end the party has increased its raids in the security zone over the last four months.
Sheik Mohammed Fadlallah, spiritual mentor of the Shiite militants, said in a statement today, "I call upon all resistance fighters to escalate their holy war against Israel."
During Sheik Musawi's leadership, nine American and British hostages who had been seized in Lebanon were released, but the Party of God persistently denied any link to the kidnappers. Sheik Musawi was said to have been close to the so-called pragmatist faction in Iran led by President Hashemi Rafsanjani.
Party of God members have claimed responsibility for the 1983 bombings of a Marine compound in West Beirut, in which 241 people were killed, and a French Army barracks, in which 58 French servicemen were killed.
The group also took responsibility for attacking the United States and French Embassies in Kuwait two years later. The roundup of the bombers by the Kuwaiti authorities led to a wave of kidnappings of Westerners in Beirut, as the captors sought to use the hostages to force Kuwait to release the Party of God members.
Sheik Musawi accused the United States of being power-hungry in his speech today at a rally in Jibchit, near Nabatiyeh. The rally marked the eighth anniversary of the death of Sheik Ragheb Harb, a party leader whose successor, Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid, was abducted from his home in Jibchit in July 1989 by Israeli commandos and remains a hostage. The Israelis offered to exchange him for Israeli servicemen missing in Lebanon and believed held by a faction of the Party of God,.
Iran has found a fertile ground among Lebanon's estimated 1.2 million Shiite Muslims. The Party of God has been Iran's main tool in exporting its Islamic revolution.
Like the Muslim fundamentalists in Teheran, the Party of God says not only southern Lebanon but also Jerusalem, where Muslim shrines are situated, must be recovered from Israel.

The Economy
 How long should Alan Greenspan wait to see whether cuts in interest rates can lift the economy? With millions of households hit by unemployment, and the White House and Congress both worried about re-election, a lot of people inside and outside Washington say the Federal Reserve should not wait much longer. Since it usually takes around six months for the stimulative effects of interest rate cuts to show up in the economy, the stimulus of the Fed's aggressive December cut of the discount rate should be noticeable by June. But this downturn is not acting the way economists' models say recessions should behave. And that, some analysts say, is why the economy remains dead in the water some 18 months after the Fed began its long series of easings. [Page D1.] 
 Job Corps has had its ups and downs, but its students are its best advertisement. The mix of vocational training, boarding school and boot camp is widely hailed for its effectiveness and costefficiency. But despite rare consensus from Government officials, economists and social scientists, the program gets scant attention and struggles to hold its own in the annual budget minuet. The Bush Administration's 1993 budget proposal, which sharply increases spending for Head Start, seeks to interrupt a proposed expansion of Job Corps. [A1.]

The Media Business
 The start-ups of two new personal finance magazines are drawing attention, especially since they come when advertising is slumping and many magazines have failed. Both Worth and Smart Money are aimed at affluent people who want more information about their personal finances. [D1.]
With advertising pages plunging, magazines closing and the birth rate declining for the first time in four years, Jake Winebaum started a magazine for parents last year.

HEADLINE: Many in Colombia Resisting Use Of a Strong Herbicide on Poppies

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, Feb. 16

 BODY:
A recent Government decision to allow chemical spraying of the poppy plants used in heroin production is drawing fire from health and environmental officials, and worrying the Indians who earn their living harvesting the crop.
On Jan. 31, the Colombian National Drug Council, made up of senior Government and police officials, approved the use of the herbicide glyphosate to destroy poppies that are not growing close to waterways and villages. 
 Glyphosate, sold in the United States as Roundup, is used in gardening and farming and has been used in several countries to eradicate marijuana and poppies. It has not been used in Colombia to fight the legendary cocaine trade there because the country mainly processes coca plants from Peru and Bolivia.
United States officials say that by the most reasonable estimate, 7,400 acres of land in Colombia are being used to grow poppies. This puts Colombia at the same level as Thailand and is "significant enough to affect the world market," one official said.
 
Faster Than Police
 The glyphosate plan was approved a week after Colombia's anti-narcotics chief, Gen. Jose Serrano, publicly called for spraying. He complained that in one recent raid, his officers had to eradicate 1,300 acres of poppies manually.
The raid, in the central province of Tolima, lasted 15 days and required 240 officers to hack away at the plants with machetes. Police say the action cost more than $250,000. "What will take 15 days for 200 or 250 to accomplish can be done by helicopter with 5 or 10 men at most," the general said.
Strong opposition to spraying comes from Health Minister Camilo Gonzalez, several Congressmen and environmental and other organizations.
 
The Problem of Drift
 "Aerial spray campaigns involve tremendous drift," said Susan Cooper, staff ecologist at the National Coalition Against the Misuse of Pesticides in Washington. "At most 15 percent of the glyphosate will reach the target acreage. Lots of off-site damage will occur that won't be seen or monitored."
Containers of glyphosate carry warnings to users to avoid contact with eyes, skin and clothing, and to keep from contaminating water and food with the herbicide. Usage recommendations note that it kills all plant life and should therefore be directed specifically at the plants to be killed.
Ms. Cooper said that while glyphosate has not been known to cause illness, she is nevertheless "not happy with it."
The Colombian authorities say poppy crops became a problem last year when cocaine traffickers began diversifying into heroin.
About 5,500 acres of poppies have been destroyed since 1991, but new fields are discovered regularly. Police believe that poppies are grown in 12 of Colombia's 32 provinces.
Glyphosate has been used in Hawaii, Belize, Guatemala and elsewhere to eradicate marijuana and poppies. It was last used in Colombia in the mid-1980's against marijuana.
A United States drug expert in Bogota said that between 1986 and 1987, glyphosate sprayed on Colombia's marijuana accounted for only 5 percent of the herbicide used in the entire country. The other 95 percent was used in agriculture. He said glyphosate is still commonly used in farming.
 
Why Machetes Don't Work
 United States and Colombian drug experts call police expeditions to destroy the crops "logistical nightmares" because most plots are nestled high in the mountains, where constant mist keeps them unseen. They are also not reachable by road, and many are guarded by armed leftist guerrillas.
Manual eradication, either by machete or by uprooting, leaves seeds that will generate crops later.
Many of the fields are tended by Indian farmers. Traffickers reportedly approached Indians in one part of the country last year, encouraging them to plant poppies rather than the traditional corn and potatoes. Poppies are more resilient than these crops, and are much more profitable.
"The Government must offer us alternative crops and help in resisting the pressure of the drug traffickers," said Hernan Gamboa, spokesman for the Indian Social Alliance in Bogota. "The Indians are obligated to plant poppies because they have no economic alternative. The situation will only get worse with spraying."
Other experts say that people should be concerned with the environmental damage that is already occurring as a result of poppy growing, including clear cutting, which erodes soil and reduces the biological difersity.

HEADLINE: Idea of Jury of Peers Is Questioned: Must a Jury Reflect the Population?

BYLINE: By DAVID MARGOLICK

 BODY:
The Constitution and the Bill of Rights are full of lofty assurances of justice. But contrary to the prevailing mythology, neither says anything about "a jury of one's peers."
Just what is a representative jury? In recent weeks, three widely publicized criminal cases have raised the same perplexing question. As is so often true in the tortured saga of American law, all three revolve around race. 
 Earlier this month, jury selection began in the trial of four white Los Angeles policemen accused of the videotaped beating of a black man. Because of pretrial publicity, the proceedings were moved from Los Angeles, where non-Hispanic blacks make up 13 percent of the population, to suburban Simi Valley, where the same group constitutes 2 percent.
On Feb. 11, a jury in Teaneck, N.J., acquitted Gary Spath, a white police officer who was charged in the killing of a 16-year-old black, Phillip Pannell. Blacks constitute nearly 5 percent of the population in Bergen County, but only 2.6 percent, or 7 of the 261 of the pool from which the jury was drawn, and none of those who actually heard the case.
On Feb. 9, a jury in Indianapolis convicted the boxer Mike Tyson of raping a contestant in a black beauty pageant. Lawyers for the boxer had complained that blacks were underrepresented on the jury although in fact they constitute 22.6 percent of population of Indianapolis and 25 percent of the jury.
 
Notion of Lore, Not Law
 In each case, there have been protestations of unfairness. But in none of them, it seems, was anything done illegally. For although the notion of a jury of one's peers dates to the Magna Carta, it looms far larger in American lore than law. The Constitution speaks only of "impartial" jurors drawn from the vicinity of the crime.
The pool, or venire, has broadened since the days when "peer" effectively meant white, male property owners, but since it is customarily based on lists of people registered to vote or drive, it retains a certain middle-class bent. But as long as such a pool is representative, the jury picked from it need not be.
Thus, like a televised lottery drawing, as long as all the numbers are in the bin, one cannot complain about the particular balls that pop up. There is nothing unconstitutional about an all-white jury sitting in judgment of a black person, as long as blacks were represented in the larger group.
Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the Supreme Court in 1990, "The Sixth Amendment requirement of a fair cross-section on the venire is a means of assuring not a representative jury (which the Constitution does not demand), but an impartial one (which it does)."
 
Limit on Prosecutors
 Albert W. Alschuler, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School, put it more colloquially, "If the luck of the draw gives you five successive juries of wealthy Republican womengolfers, there's no Constitutional problem."
A second dimension to the problem arises in the selection of individual jurors. Six years ago, in the landmark case of Batson v. Kentucky, the Supreme Court barred prosecutors from using their peremptory dismissals -- those for which no explanations need be given -- solely to exclude blacks.
There is no evidence that prosecutors in Indianapolis, Teaneck or Simi Valley did any such thing. If anything, since each case involved a black victim, they may even have deemed black jurors to be preferable. But Batson does not apply to defense lawyers, and the lawyer for Officer Spath did reject two potential black jurors.
Legal scholars say that while a jury of one's peers sounds laudable, it is completely unworkable in practice. How, for instance, could one ever come up with a jury of peers of the serial killer Jeffrey L. Dahmer? To accommodate all possible factors, not just race, but sex, class, religion and others, could be laborious indeed, like selecting a Supreme Court Justice. It could also be unconstitutional.
"The people who try the typical unemployed street criminal are not his peers, but neither were the people who tried William Kennedy Smith," said Gerald E. Lynch of Columbia Law School. Nor, he said, should they necessarily be. "There's some importance to the view that 12 people randomly drawn from the community are going to be fair," he said.
Perhaps no one, then, is a peer. At the same time, as Toni M. Massaro of the University of Arizona College of Law in Tucson has written, American tradition has it that everyone is. Justice John Marshall Harlan stated in his dissent in Plessy v. Ferguson, the infamous 1896 case upholding legalized segregation: "Our Constitution is colorblind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens. The humblest is the peer of the most powerful."
Still, the judicial system is not only supposed to render justice but give the appearance of doing so. For that reason, despite considerable constitutional and practical obstacles, some jurisdictions are attempting to reduce the odds of having monochromatic panels preside over racially charged cases.
Georgia, for instance, requires that the pools from which jurors are drawn in death penalty cases must approximate the racial and sexual composition of the counties from which they are drawn. More ambitiously, a group of lawyers and public officials organized by the Minnesota Supreme Court recently recommended that at least 2 of the 23 members of every grand jury hearing homicide cases in Minneapolis be minority members.
"Seventy-five percent of the victims and suspects in homicides are people of color," said Louis Smith of the Hennepin County District Attorney's office, who fashioned the proposal. "When you have an all-white grand jury, you're taking an unnecessary risk of cultural bias and miscommunication."
But some scholars consulted by the task force, like Mr. Alschuler and Fred L. Morrison of the University of Minnesota Law School, said they foresaw constitutional problems. The United States Supreme Court, they noted, has been increasingly reluctant to approve any laws based on explicitly racial quotas, particularly where past discrimination cannot be proven.
Moreover, they see a host of interpretive problems in a polyglot culture: Would a grand jury including a native American and a Vietnamese satisfy the standard? How about Chinese-Americans, Filipinos, or people with one black grandparent? And what if others, like homosexuals, women, Italo-Americans or the handicapped, demand similar representation?
Civil liberties lawyers nonetheless predict that the principle established in the Batson case will soon be extended not only to defense lawyers, but also to challenges based on sex, national origin and religion.
"There's very little law today, but that's going to change, because non-representative juries breed cynicism," said George Kendall of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund in New York. "There's no reason in 1992 why we can't insure that juries truly represent communities in important cases."

HEADLINE: 2d Korean Car Maker To Enter U.S. Market

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 16

 BODY:
Just about everybody believes that too many car brands are crowding the market, and some Americans are particularly vexed about Asian imports. Nevertheless, Kia Motors of South Korea is coming to America, bearing new models and a strategy intended to lure entry-level buyers.
Another Korean auto maker, Hyundai, has already tried such a strategy. Fairly or not, Kia's arrival will remind Americans of Hyundai, which drove onto the scene in 1986 with a low-price subcompact, the Excel. 
 Although Hyundai had a few years of unprecedented growth, independent tests and complaints by Excel owners indicated problems with quality and reliability. The company's sales nose-dived, and Hyundai dealers quit in droves.
 
Looking for 50 Dealers
 Kia, which is South Korea's second-largest automobile maker, after Hyundai, plans to sell a subcompact car, tentatively named the Sephia, and a compact utility vehicle named the Sportage. Initially, the car maker wants to recruit about 50 dealers in the Pacific Northwest, the Gulf Coast and the East Coast by 1993, when the cars go on sale. Later, Kia hopes to expand nationwide. Prices for the vehicles have not been set yet.
Though the recession has forced small foreign car makers like Sterling, Peugeot and most recently Daihatsu to bow out of the American market, Mr. Warner exudes optimism: "The events of the past six months suggest we are building the foundations of a strong company."
W. Gregory Warner, the executive vice president of Kia's American effort, said Kia's quality was "the same as Japanese" but at sticker prices 10 percent to 15 percent less than those of comparable models, like the Toyota Corolla.
In contrast, Mr. Warner summarized Hyundai's marketing philosophy as "Japanese cars at used-car prices." Mr. Warner said he comprehended, and therefore could avoid, Hyundai's pratfalls, since he was a top Hyundai executive until he quit in 1989.
 
Hyundai's Error
 In addition to introducing the Excel before its quality problems were solved, Hyundai erred by insisting that dealers open separate showrooms. The large investment raised expectations and stretched dealers' finances, causing many to fail or to drop out as soon as sales retreated from the swift pace of 1986-88.
The limited size and scope of Kia's venture will hardly register on the radars of the General Motors Corporation or even the smaller Japanese makers like the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation. But Kia is an embryonic force -- it made its first car in 1973 -- and its coming to America shows it has great international ambitions.
Fledgling auto makers like Kia are forging international partnerships and exploring foreign markets more aggressively. Winning a significant slice of the American market might be a long shot, but over a longer term Kia could learn a great deal and sharpen its skills by competing here.
Flanked by his Korean colleagues at the National Automobile Dealers Association convention in Dallas earlier this month, Mr. Warner displayed hand-built prototypes of vehicles in a conference room at an Embassy Suites hotel. Attendance for the convention was low, which may have accounted for what seemed to be only a trickle of dealers visiting Kia's room over two hours. The vehicles were attractive, but they had the flimsy feel of most auto prototypes.
To attract dealers and buyers, Kia will need more than low prices, high quality and a positive attitude. Experts agree a glut of world car-making capacity is saturating the American market with excess production; buyers here can choose from nearly 50 brands and hundreds of models. From mini-van to luxury roadster, consumer choice is endless and discounting is rampant.
"Kia's timing is terrible," said Thomas Dukes, an analyst for J. D. Power & Associates, an automotive marketing firm in Agoura Hills, Calif. "The economy is weak. But more important, that segment is loaded with good cars." Besides Toyota's Corolla, Kia's Sephia would compete against the Mazda 323, Ford Escort, Geo Prizm, Honda Civic and others, which start around $10,000.
Kia's Sportage utility vehicle, Mr. Warner said, may establish a market niche because of its expressive styling, compared with vehicles like the Geo Tracker and Suzuki Sidekick that sell for about $13,000.
Kia's quality is top notch, Mr. Warner contends. Proof? Kia builds the Ford Festiva mini-car, which is based on the Mazda 121. Festiva has received high marks for its quality from reviewers and the Consumers Union, which publishes Consumer Reports magazine; American and Japanese sales are respectable.
Unlike Hyundai, Kia appears content to operate initially from a modest base in the United States. Kia started as a bicycle-parts manufacturer in 1944 and graduated to trucks in 1962. The company built its first passenger car at its Sohari plant near Seoul in 1973, but the South Korean Government forced Kia to halt car production in 1981 because it thought the Korean auto market had become too competitive, Mr. Warner said.
By 1986, however, Kia was allowed to resume car manufacturing with its agreement to build Festivas for export. The Ford Motor Company bought 10 percent of Kia, the Mazda Motor Corporation 8 percent, and the auto maker added midsized and compact models for Korean consumption.
Kia has completed a second assembly plant and is working on a third that will give it the capacity to build more than a million cars and trucks annually by 1995.
Internationally, Kia sells cars and trucks in 80 countries. But those markets are less developed and require less sophistication than the United States or Europe. European sales began in July in Britain, with a goal of only 7,000 cars the first year.
"Kia feels it has the confidence," said Ken Brown, a Ford spokesman.

HEADLINE: Latin America Offers 'New World' to East Europe Emigrants

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Feb. 11

 BODY:
With an economic boom coming after a brain drain, several South American countries are turning to the economic rubble of Russia and Eastern Europe to find skilled workers.
Recalling earlier waves of European immigration to South America, governments are dusting off a recruiting pitch that was successful in the past: warm weather, economic opportunity and a fresh start in the New World. 
 "Let's say I'm an East German," said a businessman who made his fortune after coming here from Czechoslovakia after World War II. "I've lost my job; I'm fed up with the cold weather; I'm looking for new horizons. Why not Venezuela?"
But experts warn that the breakup of Communism may be South America's newest El Dorado. Skilled workers and money have been fleeing this continent for a decade. The failed coup here this month underlined the region's chronic volatility.
 
Last on Emigrants' List
 "The golden dream of this labor force is first Western Europe, then the United States, then Australia and finally Latin America." warned Jorge Mora, a Spaniard who represents the International Organization for Migration, a multilateral agency.
Plans to attract Eastern Europeans are most advanced here in Venezuela. With the state oil company starting a six-year, $48 billion expansion, Venezuela faces a skills shortage. Newspapers write of attracting 50,000 technicians over the next five years through corporate and embassy recruiting and other incentives.
"The selective immigration project is under way," President Carlos Andres Perez said in an interview, echoing advisers' predictions that the first families will arrive this year.
 
But Please, Bring Money
 In mid-January, President Carlos Saul Menem of Argentina presented a plan to admit 100,000 immigrants from the former Soviet Union.
The catch is that immigrants will be allowed in only if they bring $20,000 per person -- a fortune in the former Communist republics. The Argentine plan indicates that payment for those who have no money would come from the United States and Europe, which have yet to show great enthusiasm for the idea.
In May, Chile's congress is to vote on a law that would ease immigration for Eastern Europeans, with the incentives still under discussion. The law has a special clause on attracting Croats, apparently a bow to Chile's substantial Croatian minority. Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay have also expressed interest in attracting skilled immigrants.
Response to the offers has generally been restrained, perhaps because there has not been a lot of international publicity on the issue. In late January, however, Russian newspapers published Mr. Menem's proposal, bringing "hundreds of inquiries and lines" at Argentina's embassy in Moscow, an Argentine Foreign Ministry spokesman said in Buenos Aires.
According to a European Commission poll published in January, 13 million Eastern Europeans are interested in immigrating to the West.
 
Those Who Have Left
 Chile, Argentina and Uruguay all lost many young professionals during the 1970's and 80's because of a combination of repressive military governments and stagnant economies. Venezuela, South America's biggest oil exporter, mismanaged its economy so badly in the 1980's that living standards fell and tens of thousands of people left. But today, Argentina, Chile and Venezuela share several traits -- low inflation, rapidly expanding economies and confidence in the future.
There has been little public discussion of attracting new immigrants to Brazil. In the 1950's, 590,000 people immigrated to Brazil. But 630,000 Brazilians emigrated in the 1980's. Today, Brazil is in its deepest recession in a decade, and proposals to attract East European technicians or professors are often attacked as a threat to the jobs of professional groups.
The vast majority of this century's immigrants to Argentina, Chile and Venezuela have been southern Europeans -- Italians, Spanish and Portuguese. There has also been immigration by Ukrainians, Poles, Yugoslavs, Russians and others, but in considerably smaller numbers.
With Venezuela hoping to be the first South American nation to receive East European immigrants in large numnbers, an effort is under way here to make immigration politically palatable, describing the new policies as selective.
In the 1970's, when Venezuela started to ride an oil-export boom, millions of semiliterate, unskilled workers flocked here from Colombia, Ecuador and the Dominican Republic. About 15 percent of the nation's population of 20 million are illegal immigrants.
Believing that this flood depressed wages, some Venezuelans oppose European immigration.
"There are more than enough of us who fear there will not be any such 'selectivity' and that a human avalanche will come to compete and to displace," Rafael Calderon wrote in El Universal, a newspaper here. "We are full of immigrants who are hawkers and street peddlers."
Eduardo Fernandez, the opposition's leading presidential candidate for the 1993 elections, said of the illegal immigrants: "We have suffered from a very negative immigration -- of people with virtually no education, of people who end up clogging our social services."
 
Finding the Best
 Surveys here show a great shortfall in trained personnel for various industries. "We need 250 chemical engineers every year, but our universities only graduate 80 a year," said Freddy Rojas, president of the Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry in Venezuela.
To match immigrants to Venezuela's job needs, business executives want to create a computerized job bank to be used by recruiters in Eastern Europe. Under this plan, immigrants would sign work contracts with private Venezuelan companies. The companies and the Government would pay for air fare to Caracas, Spanish language lessons and several months' housing.
Hoping to reactivate Venezuela's agricultural sector, the National Farmers Federation has suggested that the state give 500-acre lots of land to immigrant farming families.

HEADLINE: 2 Magazines Are Started Amid Slump

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
A number of magazines have died in the last year, including Connoisseur, New York Woman and American Film. Some of those magazines had well-heeled media companies behind them, but even they felt the odds of reaching profitability were too poor in the current recession.
That may explain some of the attention being given to the start-ups of two magazines -- Worth, from the mutual-fund giant Fidelity Investments, and Smart Money, a joint venture of the Hearst Corporation and Dow Jones & Company. Indeed, since these publications have such prominent parents, and millions of dollars behind them, they are drawing quite a bit of attention. 
 Both magazines are aimed at affluent people who want more information about their personal finances than Fortune, Forbes or Business Week offers and more sophisticated investment advice than Money magazine or Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine provides.
Smart Money is aimed at readers with household incomes of at least $85,000 a year. Hearst and Dow Jones initially plan to spend about $5 million apiece to start the magazine, according to an executive who has seen the development budget.
Worth will court roughly the same readers as Smart Money, investors 35 to 50 years old with household incomes of at least $100,000. Fidelity's Capital Publishing Company is moving more aggressively than Hearst and Dow Jones, investing $15 million to start the magazine.
Why is there such a fascination with affluent investors now, in a white-collar recession, rather than in the booming 1980's?
W. Randall Jones, the chief executive of Worth, contends that with tougher times and the aging of the baby boomers, many people are reassessing their priorities.
"The No. 1 issue of the 1990's is taking control of one's financial destiny," Mr. Jones said. "In the 1980's, people were making and spending a lot of money. All of a sudden, tough economic times -- converging with having kids and supporting parents -- are grabbing us by the shoulders and saying, 'Hey, you have to get control.' "
He added: "There is a world of people who have been reasonably good at making money, extraordinarily good at spending it and not worth a damn at figuring out what to do with it for the long term. They need a magazine that has a sophisticated tone, but is not intimidating in looking at personal finance."
Worth's first issue, which reached newsstands on Feb. 4, has a cover article on "Wall Street Rocket Scientists," dealing with the creators of exotic securities. Another article discusses baby boomers' inheritances.
Although Worth's ownership by a mutual-fund company raises questions about whether it will be able to cover investing objectively, Mr. Jones asserted that the magazine would be editorially independent.
Fidelity plans to publish six issues of Worth this year and 10 to 12 issues next year, with a cover price of $3.
 
Similar Coverage
 Although no copies of Smart Money are available yet, the magazine seems likely to take a similar approach to personal-finance coverage.
Smart Money "is aimed at professionals and managers who have reached a stage where they have new or renewed interest in personal business issues," said Norman Pearlstine, the executive editor of The Wall Street Journal, the flagship Dow Jones publication. "They have more responsibility, but they also have more money, and more choices about how to invest," he said.
Mr. Pearlstine said research for The Journal showed that readers wanted more information on their personal finances.
Smart Money will include articles written by The Journal's reporters.
Hearst and Dow Jones are taking a cautious approach to starting Smart Money. About 425,000 copies of the first issue will go on sale March 3, mainly on newsstands, with a $2.50 cover price. A second issue is not scheduled until fall. The magazine's eventual goal is to become a monthly with a circulation of at least 500,000.
So far, both magazines appear to be attracting advertisers. Worth has 97 ad pages in its first issue, primarily from financial institutions, while Smart Money is expecting a similar number. Worth is offering advertisers a bonus in its first issue, since it is mailing it free to 850,000 investors who formerly received Fidelity's in-house publication, Investment Vision. But Worth will cut back, presumably to its goal of 200,000 paying subscribers, for the second issue.
Whether there is room for the two new magazines remains to be seen.
David Lehmkul, a magazine consultant, said he did not see a market for these publications, since many affluent people already rely on investment advisers and regularly read personal-finance articles in Fortune, Forbes or Business Week.
But Bob Zach, senior vice president at the Chiat/Day/Mojo advertising agency, is optimistic about the prospects for the magazines because they provide a how-to approach to investing. "By the time they are established commodities, the economy will be able to sustain them," he said.
 
Yet Another Magazine
 And if there is a market for two personal-finance magazines for the affluent, is there room for a third?
Metcom Inc., a new publishing company, thinks so. It said last week that it planned to start The Smart Investor. Its first issue is expected to be distributed as a paid insert in The New York Times on Sunday, June 14, and also sold on newsstands in the New York area. Metcom hopes to expand to other metropolitan areas.
James R. Regier, publisher of The Smart Investor, said it was aimed at "those affluent men and women in their peak earning years of 35 to 59 who are on the way to achieving their goals of financial independence."

HEADLINE: Canadians Defend Care System Against Criticism.

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, Feb. 16

 BODY:
In announcing his plan for tax credits to try to make quality medical care available for all Americans, President Bush hit one of Canada's sacred cows. He labeled Canada's universal health insurance program "a cure worse than the disease."
Admittedly feeling national pride in their 26-year-old Medicare system, many Canadians insist that in rejecting it as a model for the United States, the President also misrepresented it. 
 "I was shocked by his comments," said Carol Clemenhagen, president of the 1,200-member Canadian Hospital Association. "He denotes an interest in looking only at the pitfalls of the Canadian system, which are far fewer than the pitfalls of the American system, while ignoring our success in providing free access to health care to the population at large."
Public opinion surveys consistently show that support for the taxpayer-financed system here is very high. "Our polls indicate it is the single most supported of all social programs," said Michael Sullivan, senior vice president of Decima Research Inc. of Toronto.
Some analysts say the basic difference between the two countries' approaches is that in Canada health care is considered a social right, while in the United States it is treated more like a commodity.
Under Canadian Medicare, every citizen gets an insurance card and number entitling the person to free medical and hospital care. The citizen has to pay a fee, which works out to $400 to $500 a year. Usually, employers make the contribution for their employees. The Government picks up the tab for those on welfare.
Doctors are reimbursed by the Government based on a standard fee schedule for services, and Canadians choose their doctors. Prescription drugs are not free, although many companies have special plans that lower costs of drugs for their employees.
 
What About the Costss?
 Although Mr. Bush assailed the high cost of nationalized health care, Canadian doctors and health officials pointed to studies that have shown much lower administrative costs here than in the United States.
Canada's health-care system is the second-most expensive in the world, but spending in the United States is still considerably higher. The costs in 1990 worked out to $1,991 for every Canadian in American dollars, against $2,566 for every American.
Behind the difference, said Dennis Timbrell, president of the Ontario Hospital Association, "is the overwhelming duplication of bureaucracies working in dozens of insurance companies in the United States, no two of which have the same forms or even the same coverage." In Canada there is a single payer, the Government.
"Whether the U.S. chooses to emulate some aspects of the Canadian system or not, to falsely describe the program to the American public will ultimately reflect badly on President Bush," said Dr. Michael Gordon, vice president of medical services for the Baycrest Center for Geriatric Care in Toronto.
 
Waiting for Surgery
 The President also spoke of long delays needed to get treatment in Canada, saying, for instance, that British Columbians wait six months for coronary-bypass surgery. But since 1990, when that estimate was compiled, the wait has fallen by more than half, to 14 weeks, according to the Fraser Institute, a Vancouver-based public policy research institute.
There have been reductions in other centers as well, helped by such developments as a new central registry for cardiovascular surgical candidates in Ontario.
While there are waiting lists for elective surgery, doctors here caution against exaggerating the impact. They say there are no delays for those who are seriously ill, or injured.
"It's worth pointing out that the vast majority, 98 percent, of all Canadians have access to a health-care system without impediment created by financial circumstances," said Dr. Hugh Scully, a professor of surgery at the University of Toronto and chairman of the council on health policy and economics of the Canadian Medical Association.
 
'That Doesn't Happen Here'
 Mr. Timbrell of the Ontario hospital association recalled that when he was Minister of Health in the Ontario Government about 10 years ago "the statistics that to me showed the starkest comparison of the two systems related to personal bankruptcies."
"Fifty percent of personal bankruptcies in the States were due to medical costs," he said. "That doesn't happen here. No one in Canada need mortgage his future because of a need for hospital services."
Medical practitioners here took umbrage at the implication from the President's speech that since some Canadians go to the United States for surgery the Canadian health system is flawed.
 
Going Through a Crisis
 "Seattle has more CT scanners than all of Canada," said Dr. Scully of the Canadian association. "That's nice for Seattle. Canada could have more than it has. But it's quite inaccurate to judge from something like that that the quality of Canadian medicine is inferior."
Measured by infant mortality, projected life span or other objective evaluations of the health status of the population, officials point out that Canadians are at least as healthy as Americans. Yet even the most ardent defenders of the Canadian system agree that with shrinking government revenues combined with exploding medical expenses, Canadian Medicare, which costs $60 billion a year and whose cost is rising faster than practically any other government program, is going through its own crisis.
Although no one talks of scrapping the system, the fiscal crunch has led a growing number of provincial and federal politicians to question one of the basic principles of Canadian medicare -- that it be free. The Government of Quebec has already proposed a $5 user fee for medical services. The ruling Progressive Conservative Party at its convention last summer in Toronto also called for user fees.
Conceding that he was trampling on "sacred burial grounds," New Brunswick's Prime Minister, Frank McKenna, from the oppositon Liberal Party, recently suggested a "major restructuring," in which wealthier Canadians would be required to pay some of their own health-care costs to insure that care continue for the poorest.
But user fees are strongly opposed by many federal politicians and health-care experts, who argue that they would polarize rich and poor and eventually hurt the poorest.

HEADLINE: An Indoor Plague in Albany

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 15

 BODY:
It might have been a swarm of infinitesimal bugs, or it might have been tiny shards of plastic -- no one knows for sure -- but whatever caused the mysterious skin rashes in State Building Eight two years ago was only the beginning.
Since October, one small disaster after another has befallen the aging Department of Taxation and Finance building in the middle of the state office campus here: an overheated elevator that choked the building with smoke; rotted refrigerator coils that released sulfur dioxide into the air; a leaking steam pipe that sent a deadly anti-corrosive substance surging through the building via an ancient ventilation system.
 
Odors Galore
 With each problem, more people got sick, and the rest of the workers began to feel a bit as if this was ancient Egypt and they were the withstanding the series of Biblical plagues. On Feb. 7, as investigators were trying to finish up a report on the building's earlier troubles, dozens more employees inexplicably fell ill with new symptoms, growing dizzy, retching and passing out as their horrified colleagues gathered in the cold to watch them carried away to the hospital on stretchers. 
 The most recent spate of illnesses was different from previous ones, in which employees reported feeling everything from disoriented, forgetful and semi-paralyzed to detecting a variety of out-of-place odors -- sweet smells, gas smells, metallic smells, rotting smells, fishy smells. And while the state had an answer for most of what happened before, it is stymied now. "We did air testing on Saturday, Sunday and Monday and nothing seemed not to be normal," said Tom Tubbs, a spokesman for the Office of General Services, which manages the building.
As the state frantically tries to figure out what is going on, some officials are suggesting that the current problems are more mental than physical. The employees unions, on the other hand, are denouncing Building Eight as a classic "sick building" and calling for its total closure. Meanwhile, the workers in Building Eight -- even ones who haven't come down with anything in particular -- are trying desperately to process the state's income-tax returns while staving off the feeling that they are somehow going crazy.
Only a small percentage of the people who work in the building have fallen ill, said Karl E. Felsen, a Tax Department spokesman, but the rest are pretty jumpy. "There's a range of people from those who think we're a bunch of malingerers to those who think Oliver Stone will be filming here next week," he said.
On the eighth floor, a clerk tried to explain what it is like to come to work and see the man next to you faint dead away. "Some days you feel fairly decent. But there are days when you get headaches and a flushed, hot feeling -- you get confused," she added, looking fearfully around, as if toxic chemicals were going to come spewing invisibly out of the walls at any moment. "You smell things that you have not really smelled before. It's hard to pinpoint exactly what it smells like or even to describe it."
 
A Bureaucrat's Labyrinth
 In some ways, Building Eight's problems are an extreme example of what can happen to a state infrastructure that is aging rapidly at a time when there is no money for real repairs. Several years ago, recognizing that many of the buildings in the state office complex needed work, the state decided to build a million-square-foot structure that would house the workers in each agency by turn while their buildings were renovated.
But the plan was scrapped because of money problems, and no one, it seemed, has suffered more than the 2,600 Tax Department workers in Building Eight. Built in 1964, when offices were big, open spaces, the building has adjusted to the realities of modern work needs with more and more partitioned cubicles, making it resemble a maze for laboratory rats.
It never underwent a major renovation, and many now regard that as a mistake. "There's no doubt that when a building gets to be 25, 27 years old, it has to be brought up to date," Mr. Tubbs said.
But the state is finding itself balancing the concerns of the workers with the needs of its treasury -- this is the department that, after all, does the work to bring in $35 billion in tax revenue a year -- and with the realities of the budget. So instead of closing the building down, it has opted to test and fix as best it can.
 
Time for a Cleaning
 This fall, a team of cleaners came in to scrub the building, and a new problem was discovered. The ventilation system, built during the Rockefeller Administration, was so clogged with filth and pieces of paper that some parts of the building never got any new air at all. That explained some of the respiratory ailments. And it also turned out that workers were using a pesticide that was making more people sick.
Mr. Tubbs said that the Office of General Services had already spent almost $2 million renovating, cleaning and testing the building. A multi-agency task force has been evaluating the situation and a consultant is to put out a report in several weeks.
No one wants to come out and accuse the most recently ill workers of making it all up. "There are people who are genuinely sick there," Mr. Tubbs said. "But if you're in the vicinity of a person who becomes ill, you may suffer sympathetic illness. I never knew anyone who liked to watch anyone else vomit."
Workers admit that the mood is so tense that any hint of an odd smell or feeling of malaise can throw them into a panic. Barbara Zgrzepski, a tax compliance representative who was taken to Builing Nine after she lost her voice and passed out in October, said that recently she smelled fish in the office -- a smell that accompanied her earlier problems. "I totally lost it," she said. But it turned out that somebody was having tuna for lunch.
Dr. James Melius, director of the Division of Occupational Health and Environmental Epidemiology at the State Health Department, said that the earlier problems -- eye irritations, respiratory ailments and dizziness -- were indeed caused by the building. But he said those problems had been fixed and that it was unclear what else was wrong.
"There's no evidence that anyone had an illness related to the building," he said of the recent outbreak. "Our sense is that anxiety probably played some role in what occurred there. For the symptoms were very real and they need to be addressed."
But all the tests, renovations and explanations will not be enough for workers like James McGinnis, a 29-year-old program analysis manager who began to feel dizzy, numb and disoriented last fall. He would forget what he was talking about; he would forget what projects he was working on. He got snappish and frustrated.
Mr. McGinnis said that he didn't want to cause trouble, especially with the economy so bad and everyone's job at risk, but his whole department felt just as weird as he did. Every day, it seemed, investigators would come in and unearth something more that they claimed was causing the trouble: a rotting orange peel in the garbage; a computer emitting a bad smell; an artificial Christmas wreath; some old coats.
"I was at the point where I literally would have quit my job if I could've found another job," said Mr. McGinnis, who now works in Building Nine.
Meanwhile, life goes on in Building Eight. Last Monday, 19 people were carried to hospitals on stretchers, and 70 more reported to the nurse's station. On Thursday the task force evaluating the problem removed five copying machines and six microfiche machines from the building. Workers started to joke that the fire department rescue squad should open an office in Building Eight because they were called in so often anyway.
And on the eighth floor, employees wondered when it would end. "Some people think I'm hallucinating," said one woman, a secretary who admits to amorphous feelings of disorientation, fatigue and anxiety. "You feel humiliated and very foolish, but you just don't want to come to work in the morning."

HEADLINE: Benefits of Bank Mergers Are Disputed in 2 Studies

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Although bankers and investors expect great savings from recently announced bank mergers, two new studies confirm earlier findings that bank combinations do not tend to lower costs or raise profits.
Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta concluded in a study published last week that "we have not found any evidence that mergers significantly lower expenses." 
 The economists found in their study of all mergers from 1982 through 1986 of banks with assets of $100 million or more that the acquiring banks were more efficient than banks in general before the mergers. They also concluded, however, that in the years after the mergers, costs rose more rapidly for the combined banks than for the rest of the industry.
 
'Dose of Skepticism'
 Professors at the Harvard Business School studied mergers among New England banks from 1982 through 1987 and concluded that merged banks had reduced costs compared with other banks but the lower costs "were more than offset by the loss of business and revenue to competitors."
Both the Atlanta and Harvard studies noted that Federal banking regulators have encouraged bank mergers. While the studies did not support the possible benefits of mergers, each included caveats in which the authors stopped short of predicting that recently proposed mergers would not benefit the banks involved.
The Atlanta Fed study noted that it did not include mergers comparable in size to the recently approved combination of the Chemical Banking Corporation and the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation, both of New York, or the proposed merger of the BankAmerica Corporation of San Francisco and the Security Pacific Corporation of Los Angeles.
The study warned that although the mergers the Atlanta Fed reviewed might have been intended to reduce costs, the findings "should add a healthy dose of skepticism" to the claims about savings.
Banks generally contend they will be stronger after a merger because they can cut about 30 percent of the noninterest costs of the acquired or merged bank, while losing only a small amount of business. Such claims are important to the stockholders of banking companies involved in mergers because the acquiring banks often issue stock to finance the deal.
For Chemical Banking, the promise of $750 million of savings after its merger with Manufacturers helped it sell more than $1.5 billion of new stock in January, just a few weeks after the merger.
 
'Not a Settled Issue'
 To sort through the conflicting claims of economists and bankers, the Fed has started a long-term study of many large mergers that have been approved or proposed.
"There is not yet a lot of evidence to support the idea that there is much to be gained by mergers," said Edward Ettin, deputy director of research and statistics at the Federal Reserve Board. "But it is not a settled issue. It may be that the earlier mergers were in an environment where bankers were not emphasizing cost control as they do now."
Dwight B. Crane, co-author of the Harvard study, noted that "the quality of management makes a huge difference" in the outcome of a merger. He said that while "expense savings are very hard to achieve," some banks proved they were possible.
Mr. Crane said the industry's low profits were a clear sign that there were too many banks. He said there was not much evidence of banks overcharging for their services, "and the economy will clearly be better off if we have fewer financial instititons that are strong and profitable than if we have more institutions with weak profits."
The new emphasis on cost cutting by banks is not limited to banks involved in mergers. Citicorp, for example, is not involved in a merger but is about halfway through a two-year program to cut costs by $1.7 billion by the end of this year.
 
The Management Factor
 Mr. Ettin noted that one problem with many studies of past mergers is that they fail to recognize the differences in management.
A study in 1990 by David Humphrey, then an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond and now a professor at Florida State University in Tallahassee, found that the differences between well-managed and poorly managed banks of similar size were about four times as large as the average difference between banks of different size. That suggests that the acquisition of a poorly managed bank by a well-managed bank could produce benefits, while a merger of two poorly managed banks might not produce any, despite the increase in size.
Lowell Bryan, a partner at McKinsey & Company, a management consulting firm, said he remained convinced that there were potentially great benefits from bank mergers "when they are done well." He warned, however, that the benefits of spreading fixed costs over a larger base and the elimination of duplicated branches could easily be overshadowed by poor management.
Poor management can also undermine the benefits of mergers by allowing revenues to fall, Mr. Bryan said. "The biggest danger to revenues comes in mergers of two banks that regard themselves as equals, or cases where the dominant bank is not well run."

HEADLINE: Without the Money to Supply Prison Beds, Officials Consider Reducing Demand

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBION, N.Y.

 BODY:
The Orleans Correctional Facility was built here in the vast fields of western New York just seven years ago, part of the state's grand scheme to deal with the seemingly endless supply of inmates that the war on drugs sent pouring into its prison system.
But now Orleans and many other medium-security prisons around New York are themselves filled beyond capacity. And the state is struggling to confront a serious overcrowding problem that, if left unmanaged, will leave it with 6,000 more prisoners than beds by the end of the next fiscal year, March 31, 1993. 
 At Orleans, this has meant that 1,312 drug dealers, murderers and robbers are living, in dormitory-style double bunks, in a place designed for 742. The effects are clear. "It takes very little to get something started," said Robert Kotarski, a corrections officer. "Things can mushroom very fast."
No one wants overcrowding. It riles inmates, strains prison guards, encourages the spread of illness and generally makes prisons more volatile places. In the past, when there was money to spend, the solution to overcrowding would have been clear: create more space.
Not any more. With money scarce and a sense that more prison beds have not resulted in less crime, many lawmakers are being forced to conclude that they can no longer build their way out of the problem. Instead, they are taking a new approach: finding ways to reduce the prison population.
 
Money Shapes Philosophy
 "Economics has driven many of the nation's governors and corrections commissioners into a position where they have to tell people, 'We can't afford this any more,' " said James A. Gondles, executive director of the American Correctional Association, which represents prison administrators.
New York, along with California and Florida, was a leader in the unprecedented prison-building spree of the 1980's, in which hundreds of prisons were erected across the country. Between 1983 and 1992, the state built 29 prisons, for $2.1 billion in construction and debt service costs, increasing the total number of prisons to 68 and doubling the number of inmates housed to 57,862, from 29,253.
Some Albany legislators are still hoping the state will build the eight new prisons it planned a year and a half or so ago. But there is no more money to run those prisons.
"I think the fiscal realities have become painfully clear to everyone now," said Richard H. Girgenti, commissioner of the state Division of Criminal Justice Services.
In his budget for the fiscal year that begins April 1, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo proposes to address the overcrowding problem not by increasing the supply of beds, but by reducing the demand for them. His proposals are fueled by budgetary necessities, but they nonetheless represent a philosophical break with the past, when tough sentencing laws were enacted to lock up as many offenders as possible.
By his own account, Governor Cuomo hardly wants to be remembered as the person who filled the state with prisons. "I am going to go down as having built more prisons than any governor in New York State history, and it disgusts me that they're going to put that on my tombstone," he said at a November forum.
Passed in the 1970's, the sentencing laws required, among other things, prison terms for people convicted of violent felonies, and prison terms for people convicted of any second felony. That means that a person convicted on two occasions for selling small amounts of crack, for example, would have to go to state prison.
 
Community Treatment
 The laws still apply. But in the meantime, drug convictions have filled the state prisons with drug addicts and low-level dealers, a far different population, corrections officials maintain, than was envisioned 15 years ago. It is these prisoners, argues Thomas A. Coughlin 3d, commissioner of the state Department of Correctional Services, who should be removed from the state prison system and instead treated in community-based drug programs.
"The question is this: can you treat a drug addict better and more efficiently in the community, or can you treat him better and more efficiently in prison?" Mr. Coughlin said.
The answer has been fiercely debated in Albany for the last several years. Democrats in the Assembly tend to agree with Mr. Coughlin that the laws should be changed.
But many Senate Republicans argue that it is naive to assume that people arrested for drug offenses are any less dangerous, or crime-prone, than violent felons.
"Drugs are the most serious problem that we have," said Senator L. Paul Kehoe, a Republican of Wolcott who is chairman of the Senate Crime and Correction Committee. "The bottom line is that by the time you get arrested for drugs, you have actually committed dozens, if not hundreds, of other felonies."
The Governor proposes a series of amendments to the second-felony offender law, including giving judges the option of sending second-time felons to drug-treatment programs rather than to prison and allowing some second-felony prisoners to be eligible for parole after a third of their sentence, rather than half.
 
'Needless Incarceration'
 The Governor also proposes to spend millions of dollars more on alternatives to state prison, including community corrections and expanded drug treatment programs. "We're not just dropping them onto the streets," Mr. Girgenti said.
The idea strikes a chord with people like Robert Gangi, executive director of the Correctional Association of New York, a nonprofit group that studies prison issues. He said that the second-felony laws, which he would like to see repealed entirely, fill the prisons with the wrong people. "These laws cause the needless incarceration of people who could be handled more cheaply and effectively through other means," he said.
The issue this legislative session will be whether the Governor and the Democrats can get the Republicans to agree. Last year, the Republican-dominated Senate rejected a similar package of proposals.
Senator Kehoe said that he might support offering earlier parole to some inmates, but, "My vote is 'no way' in terms of doing away with the second-felony offender law." He added, "I don't think that lenient sentencing is the way to go in terms of reducing the prison population."
Senator Dale M. Volker, a Republican from Depew in western New York who is chairman of the Senate Codes Committee, said the question was one of law and order.
"We're willing to do some rational things, but I'm not sure if they understand the repercussions of their proposals," he said. "We just have to be careful that we don't allow dangerous criminals to walk into the community on a regular basis."
Part of the reason for the Republicans' reluctance concerns a philosophical difference of opinion over who the second-felony offenders are, and part concerns questions about the effectiveness of community drug treatments and other alternatives to incarceration. And part of it seems to come from regional attitudes about the advisability of building prisons.
 
Prisons Bring Jobs
 New prisons, which cost $65 million to build and $15 million a year to run, are desirable things in some communities, particularly rural upstate areas that need jobs.
And some lawmakers are hoping to convert state mental hospitals, scheduled to possibly close soon, into prisons.
Many such places happen to be represented by influential Republicans, in whose interest it would be to insure a continued supply of inmates to populate prisons, Democrats maintain.
"The opposition to the second-felony offender reform has to do with the fact that the law fills these prisons," said Assemblyman Daniel L. Feldman, a Brooklyn Democrat who is chairman of the Assembly Correction Committee.
"But what's good for Plattsburgh or Oneonta isn't necessarily good for New York State," he added. "How can it make economic sense to have an ever-expanding pool of people who don't pay taxes, who are supported by the taxpayers, and who are guarded by people whose salaries are paid for by the taxpayers?"
Whatever the political debate, state officials agree that if something isn't done this year and the prisoners in places like Orleans are forced to continue sleeping in double bunks, the prison system could slide into crisis.
Prison-guard unions are warning that their members can't tolerate the double-bunking situation much longer. "At some point the prison system is going to blow," said Joseph P. Puma, executive director of Council 82, the union that represents about 18,000 prison guards.
Mr. Coughlin, the corrections commissioner, also considers the overcrowding destructive. "It starts to destroy what a number of governors and legislators have developed over time as policy," he said. "And if the Legislature decides that double-bunking is a long-term policy decision, then I think the system will get extremely shaky."

HEADLINE: Island Nations Fear a Rise in the Sea

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 15

 BODY:
Representatives of 37 island nations that fear they may disappear beneath the waves if the world grows any warmer are voicing their concern at the slow pace toward an agreement on stabilizing the global climate.
These nations, including Cyprus and Malta in the Mediterranean, the Caribbean islands and archipelagos around the Pacific, say their existence is threatened by the rise of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere that contribute to the melting of the polar ice caps, which raises the ocean's level. 
 Warmer climates can also intensify hurricanes and tropical storms and kill coral reefs that protect island coastlines and harbor rich shoals of shrimp and fish.
These nations, which make up the Alliance of Small Island States, came together on Friday to prepare for a session of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee for a Framework Convention on Climate Change on Tuesday. The group wants to draft an agreement before the "Earth Summit" in June in Rio de Janeiro.
But square brackets indicating objections still surround almost every sentence in the draft agreement on stabilizing the quantity of carbon dioxide pumped into the atmosphere, mainly through the burning of fossil fuels.
"The Alliance of Small Island States members are doomed to ecological, social and economic catastrophe within the foreseeable future," Danielle de St. Jorre, the Seychelles Minister of Planning and External Relations, told the meeting Friday. "Some will even disappear. And if that happens they will take with them cultures, identities and values which are irreplaceable."
Robert F. Van Lierop, United Nations representative of Vanuatu, in the southern Pacific, said, "It's a question of survival, it's that simple. At the very least, sea level rises of a foot or so could wipe out island ecosystems. At worst, whole islands could disappear under water."
Noel J. Brown of the United Nations Environment Program, said, "We are facing a whole new category of ecological refugees."
 
4-Inch Rise in a Century
 Evidence suggests that sea levels have risen by 4 to 6 inches in the last century, and the median forecast is for a further rise of 8 inches by 2030 and 26 inches by 2100, said John C. Topping, president of the Climate Institute in Washington, D.C.
Already many of these islands are feeling the effects.
Mrs. de St. Jorre said tourist beaches are shrinking and noted that the Seychelles had to build special dikes to protect reclaimed land and sea-level industrial developments. Four tiny islands in the Maldives are being evacuated because of flooding.
The sense that they are already becoming the first victims of global warming gives the island states an urgency that they feel puts them at odds with the political priorities of the northern industrial countries and the larger developing nations.
All Western industrialized countries except the United States are ready to commit to stabilizing carbon dioxide emissions at 1990 levels by 2000, but many will only do so if the United States changes its position. Saudi Arabia and several other oil-producing states, for example, are lined up with the United States against setting any binding new targets for emission levels because they fear that this will reduce demand for oil.
Japan wants to stabilize emissions at about 9 per cent higher than in 1990 to allow for population growth.
And for the bigger developing countries, like India and Brazil, the top priority is to insure that any agreement does not restrict their economic development and that the industrial north, which is responsible for over 80 per cent of the carbon dioxide already in the air, curbs its own emissions.
Nevertheless, larger countries may have as much incentive to stabilize sea levels as small island states, according to Stephen P. Leatherman, director of the Laboratory for Coastal Research at the University of Maryland.
A three-foot rise in ocean levels would render 72 million people homeless in China, 11 million in Bangladesh and 8 million in Egypt, or four times the island states' entire population of 23 million, he said.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Challenger;
For Buchanan's Campaign, Improvising Is the Strategy

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Feb. 16

 BODY:
Two days before voters go to the polls on Tuesday, the campaign of Patrick J. Buchanan in New Hampshire remains what it always has been: a nimble, often slapdash affair that is constantly thinking on its feet, and at times tripping over them.
At breakfast today, Mr. Buchanan and some of his aides realized that the day's schedule had no events that would get the candidate on the early evening news or that would occur in time to make the early Monday editions of many newspapers. The candidate's staff immediately scheduled a news conference and brought in dozens of young supporters to provide their own cheering section to the challenger's answers to reporters' questions. 
 It took fast footwork to put together the press conference. But because the idea was conceived at the last minute, it had to be held outdoors on a Manchester street, always a dicey proposition, since one never knows what street hecklers might be present.
In fact, the press conference was twice disrupted; once by a man who said he was homeless, and again by a man who said he was with Act-Up, a militant AIDS advocacy group. Both tried to ask the candidate pointed questions, but Mr. Buchanan ignored them and was able to continue fielding queries from reporters.
 
Lean Research Staff
 On Wednesday, Mr. Buchanan's sister, Angela (Bay) Buchanan, read an article in The Washington Post indicating that President Bush was not pushing Congress for quick action on his proposal for a $500 increase in the income tax exemptions for children. By Saturday, the absence of that proposal on the President's list of high-priority steps to energize the economy was the basis of a new Buchanan campaign commerical.
That turn-around time was relatively fast. But the reason the campaign had to rely on a tip about a newspaper article is because it has virtually no research staff to investigate issues.
Despite its late start and seat-of-the pants quality, Mr. Buchanan's campaign has caused jitters at the White House. In the view of some analysts, Mr. Buchanan has already achieved the threshold goal of any insurgency: knocking a more powerful opposition off its game and making it look slow and complacent.
"Ten weeks ago, this campaign didn't even exist," Mr. Buchanan said today on a talk-show broadcast from Boston. "It was a glimmer in the eye. It was a conversation between myself and my sister on the West Coast."
 
Trying for Good 'Spin'
 In recent days, Mr. Buchanan and his aides have said repeatedly that considering how far he has come since announcing his campaign for President on Dec. 10, he has already won a victory of sorts. Such talk -- "spin," in the jargon of campaigns -- has the benefit of allowing Mr. Buchanan to save face if he falls short of the 30 percent of the vote most analysts consider the minimum for him to remain viable.
Still, for Mr. Buchanan, who has never run for or held public office and who carries enormous political baggage, having written and said things that have offended some Jews, blacks and homosexuals, to be contemplating a third of the vote against a sitting President is testimony to the attractiveness of his message to many voters and to the anger of many Republicans toward Mr. Bush.
But it is hardly a testament to a well-oiled organization.
Mr. Buchanan has only two people researching issues for him in Washington. His poll taker is a 29-year-old college professor who says he believes he is the youngest in that role in the race. The campaign has so few people doing advance work that officers like Paul Erickson, the national political director, are at times pressed into duty to set up chairs or do other chores.
 
Writes His Own Material
 The candidate not only writes his own speeches, using a personal computer in his hotel room, but drafts most of the campaign's television and radio commercials.
But Mr. Buchanan's improvised operation might work well in a state like New Hampshire, where no place is more than a three-hour drive away, and where Manchester is the center of the single media market. The primaries in Georgia on March 3 and in 11 states on March 10, Super Tuesday, will present much greater logistical and operational challenges.
Mr. Buchanan has been aided by missteps by the White House. By not making the child tax exemption a priority for Congress after he emphasized it in his State of the Union Message, Mr. Bush gave the Buchanan campaign an opening to question his credibility.
"You can have a lean, mean, hungry organization, and we can surprise people," said Ms. Buchanan, who moved to the Washington area from Irvine, Calif., to serve as the campaign chairwoman. "But we know something else: we're up against the President of the United States, and we can't do well unless he makes mistakes."

HEADLINE: Gambling on Honesty on the Homeless

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
By documenting that crack use is widespread among the homeless in New York City, a mayoral commission is betting that leveling with the public about just how bad the problem is will pay off in support for new programs to treat the addicted and to train unskilled young people who have turned to drugs.
The commission's report, which is to be released later this week, is a blistering indictment of the way the city has spent $2 billion over the last decade to shelter the homeless without confronting the deeper social problems that enmesh them. 
 But in releasing the results of the survey, based on random urine tests, the commission risks setting off a backlash against the homeless from a public that is increasingly weary of panhandlers and suspicious of promised solutions to a problem that never seems to go away.
In other fiscally strapped cities, including Washington and Philadelphia, the response to the intractability of the problem has been to slash spending on the homeless in recent years.
Andrew Cuomo, chairman of the commission, says he is confident that the new evidence about drug use, as well as a range of other problems the homeless face, will prove that society must do more, not less, to help them, and thus become the basis for a new consensus on the issue.
"Perhaps the commission's most important finding is the existence of a substantial subgroup within the shelter population," its report said. "This group essentially consists of poor young people who have grown up isolated from mainstream social and ecnomic life and who now find themselves without the basic social and economic skills necessary to survive independently."
The survey by the commission, appointed by Mayor David N. Dinkins, found that two-thirds of homeless single men and 30 percent of adults in families who live in city shelters tested positive for drugs or alcohol. Mr. Cuomo said he thought that the news would not surprise most New Yorkers but instead would reassure them that government is finally facing facts. Advocates for the homeless eager to win public support for them have too long offered a sugar-coated version of reality, he contends.
 
'A Decade of Denial'
 "You have to be honest about a problem before you can do anything about it," said Mr. Cuomo, who runs a nonprofit agency that serves homeless families. "There was a decade of denial in the 1980's, an insistence on the simplistic 'housing, housing, housing' slogan. But the problem was always deeper than that."
The commission, which sent its report to the Mayor on Saturday, argues that the vast majority of the homeless need much more than an apartment to make it on their own. The city should use a new combination of carrots and sticks to help them, it says.
The shelter system was created in reaction to a series of lawsuits, with the city responding to requirements created by the courts.
The commission calls instead for the city to strike out on a new path of its own devising. Its report calls for the city to invest $280 million to move homeless men and women out of exorbitantly expensive, barracks-style shelters into small, intensive social-service programs that the commission says will actually cost less to operate. That money will also help develop more permanent housing.
Only when families and single adults have successfully completed the new treatment or training programs, depending on their individual needs, will the city provide them with that scarcest of urban commodities: permanent, subsidized housing, the commission says.
So far, the plan appears to have generated a startling degree of agreement among the city's usually contentious political leaders. Highlights of the recommendations, disclosed by panel members, have won praise from City Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone, Council President Andrew J. Stein and the Borough Presidents of Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx and Staten Island.
All those officials had been sharply critical of the Mayor's plan for the city to build 24 small, service-enriched shelters in residential neighborhoods. Mr. Vallone vowed to stop that plan, and had the power to do it.
These same officials, sensitive to constituents afraid that the city was about to plop drug-using homeless people next door to them, much prefer the panel's plan to let nonprofit groups pick sites and develop programs for the homeless, many of them not in residential neighborhoods at all.
 
A Consent Decree
 The origins of the city's current homeless system date to 1979, when Robert M. Hayes, a 26-year-old lawyer who had never tried a case, sued the city in state court. Two years later, believing it would lose the case, the city signed a consent decree granting homeless men a right to shelter. In the next few years, advocates won similar rights for women and families.
Then, in the mid-1980's, crack, the cheap, smokable form of cocaine, went on sale all over the city and hooked thousands of poor people who were precariously positioned in society to begin with, helping tip many into homelessness.
Many who would have found shelter in cheap, shabby single-room-occupancy hotels had it been the 1960's or even the 1970's found themselves out of luck. Much of that housing had been torn down or gentrified.
They entered a shelter system with few rules and almost none that were enforced. In the huge armories for single men, now notoriously drug-infested, violent places, a crack addict could avoid paying for rent or food and spend what money he had on drugs. The city had little to offer in the way of drug treatment, and the shelters became places where drugs were sold openly.
Advocates for the homeless often emphasized a housing shortage as the root cause of homelessness. Mr. Hayes often repeated his comment that the problems of the homeless could be summed up in three words: housing, housing, housing.
Many advocates, including Mr. Hayes, are now pushing much more openly for services to help the homeless. He talks about not only the right of the homeless to shelter but also the need for a new contract between the city and the homeless, with the homeless agreeing to participate in rehabilitation programs in exchange for the promise of permanent housing. That idea is very similar to what the Mayor's panel has proposed.

HEADLINE: Energy Industry Takes Some Radical Paths

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Almost no one foresaw the oil shocks of 1973 and 1979 and the price collapse of 1986. Engineers in the 1950's were stunned by the idea that nuclear power meant cheap, limitless energy and stunned again in the 70's that it did not. New inventions, regulations and political developments rush onward, sometimes offering vast changes, but often doing no more than offering.
What is next on the horizon? 
 Here are three glimpses of the future, each of which might prove a turning point -- or a mirage. They are the large-scale direct production of electricity from sunlight, the establishment of workable agreements that would foster the use of renewable energy sources and the peaceful use of surplus plutonium from nuclear bombs.
 
Photovoltaic Cells
 Photovoltaic cells, which make electricity directly from sunlight without emissions, are waiting in the wings. While they are far too costly today to compete with conventionally made power, they are useful in devices that would be expensive to wire to the power grid, like irrigation pumps, roadside signs and emergency call boxes. And with breakthroughs in the laboratory and factory, the price of the cells is rapidly falling.
When and where will they reach the magic price level and begin to displace power from coal, oil and natural gas? With a little extra help in the form of research money, maybe next year, in White Pine, Colo. Advocates of "renewable" energy say a cluster of 33 houses high in the Rockies could become the Kitty Hawk of solar power.
White Pine, which is 110 miles southwest of Denver and 7 miles up a dirt road, is tied to the Public Service Company of Colorado's electric system by a line that crawls five miles over an 11,300-foot mountain pass. The 70-year-old line is still functional but perilously close to the tops of the winter snow drifts, and the utility fears that the wire will be a hazard to skiers. The utility wants something done by the end of the summer of 1993; replacing the line would cost $130,000.
The National Renewable Energy Laboratory, a Government research institution near Denver, and Public Service drew up an alternative: a 35-kilowatt solar cell array, coupled with batteries that would store the energy if it was not needed when the sun shone. The cells would provide two-thirds of White Pine's electric needs; the rest would come from a generator running on propane.
The cells and the generator are off-the-shelf parts. But the utility would have to develop a control system to keep track of how much electricity the cells produced, how much was in the batteries and how much was being consumed. The system would run the propane generator when needed.
"There is nothing quite like this in America, where a complete community in America would be serviced like this," said John Thornton, a photovoltaic expert at the Energy Department who works at the renewable energy laboratory.
According to Chuck Rhodes, senior planning engineer at Public Service of Colorado, the alternative system would cost $500,000. Photovoltaic cells are now most commonly found on pocket calculators, but White Pine, said Mr. Rhodes, would teach energy engineers more about utility-scale applications. The cells that would be used in the White Pine project would produce energy at a cost more than triple that of electricity from old-fashioned coal-fired plant.
The company does not think its other electricity customers should pay for the White Pine experiment and is looking for financing from the energy laboratory and others to make up the difference.
If the solar project is built, said Mr. Thornton, "it will give confidence to other utilities, so other people say, 'Yeah, that's possible.' " If the price of solar cells falls by half again -- as it has done several times -- it would be economical in some locations, he added.
Mr. Rhodes agreed. "It's inevitable that the price will come down," he said. "It's a question of how long, 5years or 20 years."
 
Renewable Energy
 Regulators have debated for years how to set prices for electricity in a way that gives appropriate advantage to power from renewable energy, like wind, sun or trees, which do not pollute or deplete natural resources. Now, the Bonneville Power Administration, which serves the Pacific Northwest, has taken a concrete step in that direction.
The administration, a Federal agency, announced in December that it wanted to sign purchase contracts with independent electricity producers, a common way for utilities to get new power supplies. But Bonneville said its contracts would specify that if over the agreements' 20-year lives Congress imposes a tax on pollutants, including one on carbon dioxide, which is believed to cause global warming, the tax would be paid by the electricity seller, and not by Bonneville. The possibility of such a tax might discourage a builder of conventional generators.
According to Gary L. Fuqua, deputy assistant administrator of Bonneville, if the generator bears the risk, "renewables" have an advantage in the bidding, because they do not emit carbon dioxide.
Energy experts say that most existing contracts are silent on the question of new taxes, and this clause represents a new direction, though Bonneville is not certain whether it will affect the bids it will receive.
But an independent producer who planned to use a conventional source like natural gas might go to Lloyd's of London for a policy guarding against a pollution tax, Mr. Fuqua said, and the price of that policy could give the edge to another technology. Or, as a precaution, a company that planned to use fossil fuels might add a few tenths of a cent to its price, giving an advantage to renewables. Or a company that specializes in plants that run on fossil fuels might decide not to bid, leaving the field open for renewables.
 
Surplus Plutonium
 A political shift, the end of the cold war, has produced a problem and an opportunity in nuclear power. The United States and the Soviet Union are disassembling thousands of nuclear weapons with tons of plutonium, which can power reactors as well as bombs.
Disassembly is a very small step because the bulk of the work involved in making nuclear weapons is in preparing the plutonium. In this case, the plowshare can be quickly converted back into a sword.
But the plutonium can be safely disposed of in a nuclear reactor. And while the precise amounts involved are classified information, it is clear that only civilian power reactors can do the job.
"We should do it damn fast," said Ersel A. Evans, a consultant and former vice president of the Westinghouse Hanford Company, which for years ran a big weapons installation for the Government. "There are hundreds of tons of plutonium out there," he said, raising the possibility that the owners could rebuild bombs, or some could be diverted by a third party. "If we're horrified by it, why don't we do something?"
On its face, this would also seem to be an opportunity, since making uranium fuel for utility reactors requires extensive, painstaking preparation. Like surplus k-rations, the bomb plutonium would seem to be available for peacetime use.
But no one is jumping.
"I don't think the utilities would be wanting to volunteer for that sort of thing," said John J. Taylor, vice president for nuclear power at the Electric Power Research Institute, a not-for-profit consortium in Palo Alto, Calif.
Loading plutonium fuel would require a license amendment, and that requires public hearings, something no utility relishes. And, experts say, many utilities are loath to make any connection between their plants and nuclear weapons. Several experts with long Government experience in plutonium-fueled reactors who now work in the civilian sector refused to be quoted on the subject.
And plutonium, unlike uranium, is highly toxic, so it must be converted into fuel rods in highly controlled circumstances. Fuel manufacturers would have to convert the plutonium from its current metal form to the ceramic form used in reactors, but plants to do this do not exist in the United States. If built, the plants and fuel would have to be guarded against anyone shopping for bomb fuel.
But no significant technical breakthroughs are needed. In fact, all American power reactors already run partly on plutonium. They convert uranium into plutonium every moment they run; plutonium is formed when a neutron freed by splitting a uranium atom crashes into another uranium atom and is absorbed by it, transforming it into a new element. When the new plutonium atom is hit again by a neutron, it splits and gives off energy.
With all the complications, Dr. Taylor said, "I wouldn't want to state that there's some economic advantage there." But if the Government put it forward as an important national problem that only the utilities could solve, he said, "I'm sure people would cooperate."

HEADLINE: METRO MATTERS;
Cuomo and Write-Ins: Will Votes Be Wasted?

BYLINE: By Sam Roberts

 BODY:
FED up with the hundreds of wrong numbers that have cost him time and money, Randall Wells finally changed the message on his telephone answering machine.
The phone number of Mr. Wells's R.G.W. Brush Company in Epping, N.H., is 1-800-922-6866. Since last month it has been flooded with calls from people who evince an interest in supporting Gov. Mario M. Cuomo for President but who cannot spell Mr. Cuomo's name. By dialing 1-800-92-COUMO, they mistakenly reach Mr. Wells instead. Bristling over the mix-up, Mr. Wells recorded a new greeting. It advises errant callers: "Mario Cuomo is a waste of time." 
 One day before the first 1992 Presidential primary, why hasn't Mr. Cuomo delivered precisely the same message to New Hampshire voters?
Mr. Cuomo's long goodbye in December was to his candidacy in the nation's first Presidential primary, not to ambition. Just before his address last week at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government, he was asked whether he regretted not running. "Only when I'm awake," he replied.
It seems indisputable that Mr. Cuomo believes that he would make a better President than either George Bush or any of the five announced Democratic candidates whose campaigns he continues to diminish by his sheer eloquence, and by killing them with kindness. (Responding to a request from former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, Mr. Cuomo directed New York Democrats to help Mr. Tsongas get on New York State's April 7 primary ballot -- help that may harm the campaign of Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas.) Mr. Cuomo's occasionally damaging public judgments suggest, perhaps, a petty impulse: if he cannot be President, why should they?
Some of the dreamers whom Mr. Cuomo stranded in New Hampshire have been working in the field for weeks promoting a write-in campaign, governed by unauthorized voices that whispered: If you draft him, he will come.
In 1964, enough New Hampshire Republicans wrote in the name of Henry Cabot Lodge to give him a primary victory with 35 percent of the vote. President Lyndon B. Johnson got more than 49 percent as a write-in candidate four years later, although Eugene J. McCarthy, with fewer votes, was pronounced the upset winner.
The outcome in New Hampshire has traditionally been less a factor of who gets the most votes than how close that figure compares to expectations.
"How do you define victory when there's no candidate?" asked John A. Marino, the New York Democratic state chairman, who then definded it this way: "Five percent is a high number. That's impressive to me."
Vincent Tese, Mr. Cuomo's Economic Development Commissioner and confidant, suggested that breaking into double digits would be even more impressive and that 15 percent -- the goal set by the draft-Cuomo campaign -- "would be incredible."
Mr. Wells estimated that his lead-paint-removal company had already received about 600 calls from people inquiring about the Cuomo campaign -- a number that itself represents fully one-half of 1 percent of all the people most likely to turn out tomorrow. (They may represent the less literate minority of Cuomo supporters who, nonetheless, defy the prescription from the musical "Fiorello" that nobody wants a candidate whose name they can't spell).
Anybody watching Mr. Cuomo's televised speech at the Kennedy School last week would have found it frustrating, as Mr. Tese said, because "any time he gets up and talks, there's a glaring difference in the quality of what he says and how he delivers it." For example, the Governor described the President's oratorical assault on welfare cheats as "the ultimate cheap shot" since the main Federal welfare program represents 1 percent of the Government's budget and saving 10 percent of that would be "a miracle."
If Mr. Cuomo has no intention of running, though, why not tell New Hampshire voters, as Mr. Wells has, not to waste their votes? Criticized at home, he asked how he could discourage committed volunteers in New Hampshire who want to say nice things about him. His response evokes what he said in October to a contributor who asked him to consider running: "What am I going to say, no?"
The Governor's graciousness is commendable. His concern that his voice would otherwise be lost in the din of declared candidates is understandable. But just as he finally disavowed a favorite-son candidacy on his behalf in January, why not reiterate his position as the deadlines approach for entering the California primary, with a March 19 cutoff, and for adopting a New York State budget, by March 31.
"Would you be willing to say that you'd believe it if I said I was willing to say I wouldn't change my mind?" the Governor asked after his Harvard speech.
"I don't know," his questioner replied.
"Me neither," Mr. Cuomo said.

HEADLINE: The Fed's Rate Cut Prospects

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 16

 BODY:
In public addresses that are as hard to decipher as hieroglyphics, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, has repeatedly said the central bank would make deeper interest-rate cuts if they were needed to lift the economy out of its torpor.
But in his carefully crafted speeches, Mr. Greenspan has also said the Federal Reserve's recent series of interest rate cuts should suffice. 
 That leaves a big question: How long should Mr. Greenspan and the nation wait to see whether the recent rate cuts do the trick? With millions of households hit by unemployment, and the White House and Congress both worried about their re-election prospects, a lot of people inside and outside Washington say the Fed should not wait much longer.
 
Usually a Six-Month Lag
 It usually takes around six months for the stimulative effects of interest rate cuts to show up in the economy, most economists say. The hoped-for result is that people buy houses and cars, which, in turn, will increase sales of dishwashers, bookshelves and tires and encourage industry to order more steel, wood and rubber.
Thus, the Fed's aggressive December cut of the discount rate, to 3.5 percent from 4.5 percent, should be felt by June -- if, that is, the stimulus works on the same schedule that it has in other post-World War II recessions.
But this downturn is not behaving the way economists' hypercomplex models say recessions should behave. And that, some analysts say, is why the economy remains dead in the water some 18 months after the Fed began its long series of easings that culminated in the Dec. 20 cut.
 
'Balance-Sheet Recession'
 "At no time in the entire postwar period is there greater uncertainty over the issue of what the lag time is after Fed easing," said David M. Jones, chief economist with Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a New York securities firm.
The previous postwar downturns were "inventory recessions," in which consumer demand fell, goods piled up at warehouses and output dropped. To get the economy out of recession, policy makers were usually able to rely, without much problem, on a straightforward stimulus, through interest rate cuts, increased spending or tax cuts, to get consumers buying again and industry humming again.
But the current downturn is a "balance sheet recession." The economy drooped because consumers and businesses were weighed down by debt and banks by bad loans.
With any significant fiscal stimulus unavailable because of the yawning Federal budget deficit, monetary policy has become the main gun in the anti-recession arsenal.
The Fed's rate cuts made it easier for consumers to handle their debts by encouraging them to refinance their mortgages and by fattening up their assets, thanks to the soaring stock market. To lighten their debt burden, businesses can issue equity or lower-interest-rate bonds to replace high-interest-rate bonds.
Policy makers hoped that once household balance sheets improved, consumers would start spending again. Consumer confidence remains stubbornly low, however, and Mr. Greenspan has said this reluctance to spend reflects nagging concerns about layoffs, sluggish income growth and the less-than-brilliant long-term outlook for the American economy.
Thus, it is proving more difficult to lift the nation out of this recession than previous postwar ones.
To determine whether interest rate cuts are really powering a recovery, economists usually look to several indexes: auto sales, housing sales, retail sales and purchasing orders.
The biggest bright spot is the jump of six-tenths of 1 percent in January retail sales, reported Thursday. Car sales also rose in early February, although from a low base, and real estate agents reported a pickup in the number of people shopping for houses.
In addition, the M-2 money supply is starting to grow, and economists say that that growth means households with money left after paying debts or compensating for the loss of other income are moving it into checking and NOW accounts and out of illiquid long-term deposits held for a rainy day.
But these robins do not necessarily make a spring, analysts say. Negatives include the drop in industrial output in January of nine-tenths of 1 percent and the 5 percent drop in durable-goods sales in December, the biggest monthly decline since 1982. Consumer confidence slid in December, as did the index of leading indicators, and the 7.1 percent jobless rate remained unchanged.
 
No Imminent Rebound Seen
 Little wonder that many economists see no imminent rebound, although Mr. Greenspan has predicted that growth will pick up in the second quarter.
"My belief is the monetary input to date has probably stopped the significant erosion in economic activity but is not enough to produce a significant rebound," said Henry Kaufman of Henry Kaufman & Company, a New York money management firm.
Complicating the picture is the recent upward drift of long-term interest rates. This rise could hold back growth by hurting business investment as well as home sales, since rates for 30-year mortgages have increased.
Analysts give numerous reasons for the rise in long-term rates. Some investors believe that the economy and interest rates have bottomed out. They also worry that wrangling between the White House and Congress will push the huge budget deficit even higher. In addition, Germany's high interest rates affect rates here.
Some economists say the Fed should push down short-term rates once more to offset the higher long-term rates. But Mr. Greenspan said that a further cut in the discount rate could ultimately push up long-term rates because lower rates often spur inflationary fears. In his testimony, he was quick to add that inflation was firmly under control.
With the economy as well as Mr. Greenspan giving out mixed messages, analysts say it is a close call whether the Fed will ease further. But some economists say one additional factor might just weigh in favor of further easing: this is a campaign year, though the Administration, while not letting up the pressure, is not jawboning too hard at the moment.
"The Fed tries to be above politics, but it doesn't usually succeed," said David Wyss, research director at DRI/McGraw Hill, an economics consulting group. "Nobody inside the Beltway can be outside politics. I think you'll see the Fed try to keep its head down so it doesn't look as if it's trying to influence the election. They'd like to get any easing over early in the year."

HEADLINE: You Can Too Buy the American Car You Want;
Who Can Afford It?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I was sitting at my kitchen table when I read "I Tried to Buy a U.S. Car (Sigh)" (Op-Ed, Jan. 24) by Verne W. Newton. It strikes me that Mr. Newton has hit upon the problem in the auto industry. Not in his experience in trying to buy American and not in the indifferent way he was received by the dealers. 
 But, like many Americans, he was buying a car for the first time in 15 years. Therein lies Detroit's problem. No one anticipated that Americans wouldn't be buying cars every two or three years. Where were the economic planners? With automobile prices going the way of prices for homes, who could afford to buy any car -- foreign or domestic? You can't blame the auto industry: it just followed the Government, retailers and everyone involved in setting prices.
When someone like me earns the same salary for the last 10 years, or when people who have been laid off and are working again at lower wages are not included in the statistics for unemployment, there is no accurate gauge to determine what the buying power of the American people really is.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Campaign Memo;
Voters Want Candidates To Take a Reality Check

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Feb. 16

 BODY:
For many years now, Americans have turned away from root-canal politics. They did not want to be told to eat their peas, tighten their belts or pull up their socks.
Jimmy Carter's malaise, Walter F. Mondale's tax increase proposals and Michael S. Dukakis's austere and sanctimonious style all sent voters fleeing. They much preferred Ronald Reagan's sanguine message of "morning in America" and the blithe spirit of George Bush, whose press entourage in 1988 adopted the song "Don't Worry, Be Happy" as a campaign anthem. 
 But now, the mood has changed. Worn down by recession, Americans appear to have a lower threshold for sugar-coated promises and economic siren songs.
 
Time for Something New
 In polls and interviews, voters say they are ready for something new in politics: the truth. They say they want leaders with candor, not leaders who pander.
"I don't want any sweet talk," said Donna Ash, the owner of W. H. Ash and Daughter Antiques in Goffstown, N.H. "We have tried all the easy solutions. They don't work. We need to spend money and save it, too. And we need somebody courageous."
Like her father, Ms. Ash is a lifelong Republican who voted for George Bush. She says they are both bitter about Mr. Bush because they believe he neglected the economy and now "the bubble is going to burst and the bottom is falling out of the country, as it has fallen out of the state."
She is leaning toward crossing party lines in the primary on Tuesday and voting for Paul E. Tsongas, the Democrat with the least-sweetened economic message, because "he seems to realize that our pain is real."
Republican campaign workers in Washington say that their secret polls reflect a yearning for a politician who is willing to offer the public hard truths, not inflated promises.
Mr. Tsongas says he is not running with a red hat, white beard and bag of presents. Unlike some of his Democratic rivals, he has not baited his economic program with middle-class tax cuts and protectionist sentiments.
With more hair shirt than blue sky, he says that his fight to overcome cancer has made him especially qualified to offer the American public some reality therapy.
 
An Uphill Climb
 Unlike President Bush, who says everything will be fine if the nation just waits for an economic upturn, Mr. Tsongas says it will be a tough, uphill climb to recovery.
"There are two roads, one is easy, one is comfortable, but it's downhill," he said in the debate here tonight. "The other is the road to economic prosperity for a great America, a healthy America, a vibrant America."
Mr. Tsongas added: "I think what you're saying to us is: 'We are ready. Tell us the truth. Give us the economic truth. We can deal with it. We can prevail We are a great nation. Treat us that way.' George Bush has not."
Mr. Tsongas's approach is reminiscent of the cry of Howard Beal, the mad prophet of the airwaves, in the Paddy Chayefsky movie "Network": "I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it any more."
Ted Van Dyk, a Democratic strategist who has decided to offer his support to Mr. Tsongas, hopes the public is in "the 'Network' mood," adding, "We're fed up and we're not going to take Reagan and Bush and the Democrats promising voters what they think they most want to hear and fitting their messages to polls."
Even Michael K. Deaver, one of the architects of Ronald Reagan's "morning in America" theme, agrees that "people want some real answers, someone to tell them how we're going to solve these problems."
Mr. Deaver, who turned the telegenic good-news Presidency into an art form, said he does not think Mr. Tsongas's sad-sack appearance and blurry diction will hurt him, if he wins the New Hampshire Primary and tries to mount a national campaign.
"He looked down the barrel," Mr. Deaver said, referring to Mr. Tsongas's illness. "When people look at him, they believe they're getting the real stuff."
Some analysts said that the criticism that Gov. Bill Clinton was too slick would hurt him with an electorate that may be tired of slick deliveries and excessive promises.
From the Great Depression until the 1980's, the Republicans were seen as the party of denial. For decades, the battle of imagery pitted Franklin D. Roosevelt against Herbert Hoover, and the Democrats found it hard to lose. Ten years ago, Ronald Reagan and abundance replaced Hoover and denial as the Republican symbol.
But there are signs that the public may be willing to embrace the pain, as therapists put it, and acknowledge Mr. Tsongas's claim that "there is a morning after" and "this is when the brutal part starts.
Mr. Mondale, whose proposal to raise taxes in 1984 badly hurt his campaign, said that people have begun coming up to him recently to tell him he was telling the truth, and that they regretted not voting for him.
"Maybe the public is waking up and getting skeptical about simple public relations, effortless, happy-talk rhetoric," he said. "Maybe the public is finally saying we've got to look at basic questions. We're slipping. We're losing our edge. We don't hve savings or work habits or a good educational system."
Gerald Rafshoon, Jimmy Carter's media adviser, said that voters always want the antithesis of what they have had before.
"Reagan was the antithesis of Carter because he offered blue skies and a big sleeping pill," Mr. Rafshoon said. "Now the public is desperate and they are not getting turned off by politicians who talk about sacrifice and pain. They want someone who is not connected with the establishment or the media or power brokers or any form of organized slickness."
Mr. Tsongas knows that he is benefiting from this factor. "After eight years of me," he joked, "Americans are really going to want someone telegenic."
 
Same From Republicans
 The Republicans are continuing to cleave to the politics of abundance, not sacrifice.
Patrick J. Buchanan's message is that Americans have already made enough sacrifices to end the Great Depression, win World War II and achieve victory in the cold war. The conservative commentator now offers voters the palliative that by cutting taxes, firing Federal bureacrats and cutting regulation their economic troubles will end.
Mr. Bush has engaged in mostly upbeat rhetoric, as well, scorning rivals who talk of an "America running scared."
And after years of accusing the Democrats of over-promising, Mr. Bush is trying to spur his campaign here by repeating his off-again, on-again promise of a increase of $500 in the tax exemption for children.
Mr. Bush once blithely made pledges about stopping the scourge of drugs and saving the children of the inner cities and promising that American students will be first in the world in math and science by the year 2,000. But now Americans say they are skeptical of such rosy promises.
Mr. Tsongas says that such campaign pledges will fall victim to a "fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me" mentality.
The essence of Mr. Tsongas's bad-news philosophy is summed up in his line "The cold war is over; Japan won."
 
Voice of Voters
 Fred Kelley of Kelly's Kars in Goffstown, said that he used to make his decision on gut instincts, or by voting for the Republican. But not this time. This time he has studied the economic plans of all the candidates.
"I'm realistic," he said. "It's going to be four or five more years before we are out of this. So I think I'm looking for the guy who recognizes that the most and will help us the best."
Talking about the economic blight that has cast New Hampshire into misery, he said he went through a few stages.
"At first I didn't care, didn't think it would last," said the 70-year-old car dealer. "Then I thought it wasn't as bad as they said. But it's been a long time since we could sell some cars. Now I'm scared."
John Gilman, 59, a truck driver from Bedford, reflected the mood of cynicism. "They all say they are going to save us and I don't even know if we can be saved," said Mr. Gilman, who drives a yellow Chevrolet with a bumper sticker that says, "Made-Bought-Paid For By Americans."
"I'm not a cynic, but you get a little desperate after a while," he said.

HEADLINE: Exponent of Government-as-Business Is Gaining Bigger Audience

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, Feb. 16

 BODY:
In Florida, Gov. Lawton Chiles followed the advice of a little-known political consultant and freed some of his largest state agencies from their cumbersome rules, quickly raising productivity.
In Massachusetts, Gov. William F. Weld listened to the same consultant and made money-saving changes in the state's Medicaid program. 
 On the Presidential campaign trail, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas salts his stump speeches with phrases from the consultant, like "paying for performance."
Democrats like Governor Chiles and Governor Clinton and Republicans like Mr. Weld are among the many state and local officials around the nation who are quietly experimenting with the ideas of David Osborne, a 40-year-old journalist who has become a proselytizer for more efficient government.
Mr. Osborne, in a series of articles, books and speeches, has started a movement to revolutionize government through what he calls "entrepreneurial government."
 
Different Realities
 His latest book, which chronicles hundreds of successful examples of making government more effective, was published last week, titled "Reinventing Government: How the Entrepreneurial Spirit Is Transforming the Public Sector From Schoolhouse to Statehouse, City Hall to the Pentagon" (Addison-Wesley). The co-author, Ted. A. Gaebler, is a former city manager of Visalia, Calif.
Behind Mr. Osborne's work is his belief as he stated in an interview last week that "with the transition from an industrial domestic economy to a global, postindustrial, knowledge-based economy the realities government has to deal with are different."
Government as it evolved in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was based on the same principles as Detroit's assembly line style manufacturing, and is just as outmoded, he said in the interview here, near his home in the suburb of Dedham.
This traditional form of government meant sluggish centralized bureaucracies preoccupied with rules and hierarchy, Mr. Osborne said. They worked well at the time, but today they cannot deal with the new problems like international competitiveness, shrinking tax revenues, deteriorating public schools, soaring health care costs and persistent welfare rolls.
"The fact that we are in a global market has meant a shrinking pie" as once-strong American industries have lost jobs and governments have therefore lost tax revenues, Mr. Osborne said. The central event in this turnabout for government was the tax revolt that started with Proposition 13 in California in 1978, Mr. Osborne said.
Mr. Osborne insists that what he is advocating is neither liberal nor conservative in the conventionial sense.
"Our fundamental problem is that we have the wrong kind of government," he wrote in "Reinventing Government." "We do not need more government or less government, we need better government."
What Mr. Osborne would do, at a time of widespread fiscal crisis, is to cut costs without eliminating essential services through a more imaginative and efficient approach to government. To some extent, he wants to make government run more like business.
 
Good Business Management
 He would introduce principles of good business management into government. Hence Mr. Osborne calls for more competition in government -- including school choice plans and schemes for privatization of services -- greater decentralization, more emphasis on performance instead of regulations and attempts to enlist local support by making people feel they own their government.
But Mr. Osborne, a Democrat by inclination, argues that it is misleading to think government can or should ever work just like business, because their purposes are funadamentally different.
One of his proposals, implemented by Governor Chiles in Florida and Governor Ann W. Richards in Texas, is intended to get around the problem of government agencies' spending their budgeted money before the end of the year so they are not given less the next year. Mr. Osborne's answer is to have agencies that save money turn back part of it to the state and keep the rest, using it for bonuses or new equipment.
 
Ideas Termed Borrowed
 Mr. Osborne is not without his critics. Harry P. Hatry, the director of state and local government research at the Urban Institute in Washington, notes that Mr. Osborne's has borrowed many of his ideas from other writers and even President Ronald Reagan. "Osborne has just done a good job of packaging and marketing them, so we've now got an express train going instead of a local," he said.
Mr. Hatry also cautions that it is more difficult to measure performance in government than in business. "I think most of his principles are good, but a lot of people are a little glib in talking about making government run more like business," he said.
Al Bilik, the president of the Public Employee Department of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. in Washington, is concerned that Mr. Osborne's stress on competition and privatization is just a subterfuge for laying off government workers. "When he talks about promoting competition between government and the private sector for the same service, I think he is naive," Mr. Bilik said. "What he is saying is that the only way to keep people on their toes is to threaten their jobs."
 
Anti-War Journalist
 Mr. Osborne, a native of San Jose, Calif., began his career as a journalist for Pacific News Service, an avowedly left-wing organization that opposed the Vietnam war. But after the passage of California's tax-cutting Proposition 13, he became interested in how state goverments were responding to what he saw as the end of the era of the New Deal and the Great Society.
His first book, "Laboratories of Democracy" (Harvard Business School Press, 1988), explored how several governors were developing ways to provide services and spark economic growth in the Reagan era. The most successful governor in the 1980's, Mr. Osborne says, was Mr. Clinton.
In a state with the worst record of support for public schools, for example, Governor Clinton dramatically increased spending for education. He also won a battle to force testing of teachers for competency and greatly decentralized decision making authority down to school principals.
Mr. Osborne acknowledged drawing some of the ideas for his new book from Gov. Clinton's work. In turn, Mr. Clinton has picked up some of his campaign themes from Mr. Osborne's writing, like the need to reform government.
Two other governors whom Mr. Osborne touted in "Laboratories of Democracy" have not done so well. The are Michael S. Dukakis, the former Governor of Massachusetts and the Democratic Presidential candidate who lost to George Bush in 1988, and Dick Thornburgh, the former Republican Governor of Pennsylvania and Attorney General who lost his bid for a Senate seat last fall in a stunning upset to Harris Wofford. Mr. Wofford called strongly for national health insurance.
Mr. Thornburgh's loss was a good illustration of the new reality of politics, Mr. Osborne said. "People don't want passive government," Mr. Osborne said. "What they want is a government that does more and spends less."

CORRECTION-DATE: February 25, 1992, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Feb. 17 about David Osborne, a political consultant, incorrectly described the Pacific News Service, for which he once worked. The service provides articles from countries around the world about social policy and international issues; it is not an avowedly left-wing organization.

Turf Wars Becoming More Fierce

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES

 BODY:
ALL over the nation, newspaper executives have been gathering at winter meetings of their state press associations to fret, worry and try to figure new ways to outflank competitors.
But as never before, a sizable part of the competition is probably in the same room with them. Though direct mailers, broadcasters and yellow pages still top the newspaper enemies lists, papers are increasingly going outside their traditional markets to compete with rivals farther away from their hometowns. 
 And while these newspaper wars may be taking place in small towns, the battles can be as fierce as the few remaining urban newspaper wars in such cities as Chicago, New York, Houston and Denver.
Indeed, the widely believed notion that a community's only hometown daily has a monopoly in its market is now often wildly misleading.
The advertising drought has pushed all newspapers to seek new sources of revenue, prompting some friendly neighboring publishers to poach on each other's turf, and turning hitherto gentlemanly competition into the more cutthroat variety.
For instance, perhaps the battle royal of all the newspaper wars is taking place in Chapel Hill, N.C., the charming village that is home to the University of North Carolina.
"On some corners around here, there are 20 or 25 paid and free newspaper racks," said Robert W. Parks, publisher of The Chapel Hill Newspaper, the 69-year-old hometown paper owned by Ottaway Newspapers Inc. that has repeatedly been chosen as the best small daily by the North Carolina Press Association.
By conventional wisdom, as the local daily The Chapel Hill Newspaper should dominate the market.
But Chapel Hill, which has many well-educated and wealthy residents, has proved very attractive to a plethora of local newspaper entrepreneurs and equally irresistible to the dailies in Durham, 8 miles away, and Raleigh, 18 miles away.
The Durham Morning Herald now publishes a special zoned edition called The Chapel Hill Herald and both The Herald and The News and Observer from Raleigh have big bureaus in Chapel Hill.
Add to the melee The Village Advocate, a well-established weekly shopper that has almost no news content; The Spectator and The Independent, two alternative weeklies; The Daily Tar Heel, the 20,000-circulation university daily that scours the town for ads, and a host of niche publications on sports, real estate and the like.
And competing for circulation, though not advertising, are the nationally circulated dailies: The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and USA Today.
While Chapel Hill is an extreme example of newspaper competition, it is far from unique.
Metropolitan papers, facing dwindling readership and depressed business conditions in their home cities, are trying to steal the readers -- and ads -- of suburban dailies.
Suburban dailies, many of them in old towns that were once outside the shadow of the closest big city, are now being squeezed by metropolitan dailies on one side and swarms of often-free weeklies on the other.
"What it does to me as the hometown daily is to have to compete on two frontiers," said Richard V. Stevens, managing editor of The Olathe Daily News, a 10,000-circulation in Olathe, Kan., the seat of Johnson County, about 30 miles from downtown Kansas City, Mo.
Until relatively recently, the proximity to Kansas City was not a problem for The News, which is owned by Harris Enterprises Inc.
But Johnson County's population more than doubled to 65,000 in the last decade, and The Kansas City Star, owned by Capital Cities/ABC Inc., aggressively invaded the area.
Similarly aggressive is Sun Publications Inc., a chain of free weeklies that publishes different editions of its papers tailored to individual communities. In Olathe, its paper is called The Olathe Sun.
The competition is fierce.
"Day to day, it's straight up; if we're at the courthouse, they're at the courthouse," Mr. Stevens said.
In areas of the country like New England that have been hit particularly hard by the recession, intense newspaper competition can push a hometown daily into unprofitability, which would have been almost unimaginable only three years ago.
Certainly no metropolitan daily has been more aggressive in going after outlying markets than The Hartford Courant in Connecticut, which is owned by the Times Mirror Company. For instance, The Courant invaded Middletown, about 15 minutes from downtown Hartford.
"We are under the guns of Hartford," said Michael G. Miller, president of the Eagle Publishing Company, which acquired The Middletown Press in October from the family that had owned it.
The circulation of The Press is now 18,500, compared with circulation of 21,000 in 1984, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations.
Though newspaper publishers are reluctant to give specifics, many small, long-established hometown dailies in New England are thought to be losing money and, in some cases, may cease publication because they cannot find a buyer.
Often in such cases, the paper is in a decaying mill town and has been under a family ownership that has difficulty coping with the sophisticated marketing and costly investment in news coverage that metropolitan dailies and big weekly groups are able to mount.
But hometown papers need not necessarily be the loser in competitive battles with other papers.
"If you have an alert, vigorous, close-to-the-market suburban daily, it is likely to prevail," said Lee Dirks, president of Lee Dirks & Associates, a newspaper brokerage.
And for some hometown papers, the old monopoly concept still applies.
"Our major competitor is the yellow pages," said Wayne E. Schile, publisher of The Billings Gazette, in eastern Montana.
The Gazette owns both local shoppers in Billings, and the nearest daily in the state is The Bozeman Daily Chronicle, almost 100 miles away.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
It's His Baby: Publisher Thrives on Family Fun

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE CARMODY

 BODY:
With advertising pages plunging, magazines closing, and the birth rate declining for the first time in four years, guess what Jake Winebaum did last year.
He started a magazine for parents. 
 He called it Family Fun, put out two issues with a circulation of 200,000 each and last week sold the magazine to the Walt Disney Company. (Don't think the beleaguered magazine industry doesn't eat up stories like this.)
Mr. Winebaum, who was previously senior vice president of marketing at U.S. News & World Report, is 32 years old. What he did was look around and come to the conclusion that -- statistics notwithstanding -- everyone he knew was having babies.
 
Fast-Paced Magazine
 "We had five couples we were very close to in Washington, all of them in their mid- to late 30's, all married for over 10 years," he said. "Within an 18-month period, they all went from no kids to everyone having one. Two of the couples are already moving on to their second child."
With help from U.S. News & World Report that included the use of advertising and circulation staff, Mr. Winebaum started Family Fun last April, investing a "substantial sum" of his own money in it. A colorful, fast-paced magazine aimed at parents of children 3 to 12 years old, it focuses on family leisure-time activities, ranging from trips to the zoo to ways to divert a bedridden child.
Enter John Skipper, vice president of magazine publishing at Disney, who has repeatedly said he is looking to expand the magazine division. Disney owns Disney Adventures, a digest-sized children's magazine started in October 1990, and Discover magazine, a science magazine acquired from Family Media Inc. last summer that will be completely redesigned with the next issue.
"We think Family Fun is a fairly key acquisition; we are a family magazine publishing company and it will become our standard bearer," Mr. Skipper said. "It's such a good fit with our own magazines that it was almost a magazine we had to have."
He declined to disclose the terms of the sale except to say that Disney bought all the assets of Family Fun. Mr. Winebaum will continue as publisher and editor. Disney plans to publish six issues a year at first and increase the frequency to 10 issues a year by 1994.
 
Magazine's Advertisers
 The acquisition puts Disney in the position to sell joint advertising for Family Fun and Disney Adventures, which is aimed at 7- to 14-year-olds. Mr. Skipper said Disney planned to create some kind of a spinoff of Discover for children next year.
Family Fun has been attracting advertisements for products like children's clothes and toys, as well as cars and life insurance. Mr. Skipper said children's advertising was among the ad categories the least hard hit by the recession.
"Remember that most of our advertising is still for fairly low-ticket items -- cereal, candy bars, blue jeans, video games," he said.
Mr. Winebaum explains the rationale for starting his magazine by saying that while many women baby boomers waited to have children until they were in their late 3o's so they could get their careers under way, the next generation is having babies at a much younger age.
"The 'baby busters,' who were born after the end of the baby boom in 1964, are having kids earlier," he said. "All the surveys of that generation show that they place kids at much higher importance than baby boomers did. But both generations are having more kids. All of a sudden, they are saying that maybe this career stuff is not more important and the size of families is going up again."
But Martin O'Connell, chief of the fertility statistics branch of the United States Census Bureau, said there was no indication from the 1990 census data that the three-child family would be the norm by the year 2000. The last time that the three-child family was the norm was in 1964, the last year of the baby boom, he said.
 
Smaller Family Size
 There is a significant difference, between then and now in terms of family size, even though the birthrates for the two periods were almost the same. In 1964, there were 4,027,000 births, compared with about 4,100,000 in 1991. But in 1964, there were 35 million women of child-bearing age. In 1991, there are 60 million.
And once again, real life is sticking out its tongue at statistical projections. The birthrate has turned out to be higher than that projected five years ago. So, Mr. O'Connell said, "The projections report is not really useful at this point."

HEADLINE: BAKER AND YELTSIN AGREE ON U.S. HELP IN SCRAPPING ARMS

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Feb. 17

 BODY:
Russia today accepted a broad range of United States assistance for dismantling its nuclear arsenal, including 25 specially fitted American railroad boxcars to transport its nuclear warheads to storage sites and $25 million to set up an institute employing former Soviet nuclear-bomb designers in projects with peaceful uses.
The Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, also announced after three hours of talks in the Kremlin with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d that he and President Bush would hold a summit meeting in the United States in July, although the precise date has not yet been determined. 
Mr. Yeltsin also surprised Mr. Baker with a request for further loan guarantees so that Russia can borrow money to buy American grain. In the last two years, the Bush Administration has extended a total of $3.75 billion in such guarantees for grain purchases.
 
Little Grain Left
 Mr. Yeltsin said that by early April, Russia will have used up all credits; he asked Mr. Baker for $600 million more to keep sufficient bread in the stores.
"I appreciate that the Secretary is not in a position to respond to that request because he has to report that to the President and Congress," Mr. Yeltsin said during a joint news conference with Mr. Baker, "but I have no doubt that there will be a positive response on the U.S. side."
Mr. Baker said that the Administration would consider the grain request, but he emphasized to Mr. Yeltsin that the republics of the new Commonwealth of Independent States, the Soviet Union's rough successor, must continue to pay principal and interest due on credits already extended.
Otherwise, American officials said, Congress would be prevented by law from authorizing any further grain assistance.
In recent weeks, American officials have grown worried that because of the economic turmoil in Russia, Mr. Yeltsin's Government might be unable to meet its grain-debt payments.
The officials said Mr. Yeltsin made no other requests for economic help -- like a currency-stabilization fund -- despite earlier statements implying that Washington was not doing enough to support his economic reforms.
The Yeltsin-Baker talks today focused on how the United States could help Russia and other former Soviet republics gather, dismantle and destroy the nuclear, chemical and biological weapons that they have agreed to eliminate either on their own, or in compliance with the terms of recent strategic-arms and chemical-arms-reduction treaties.
Congress has granted the Bush Adminstration $400 million to assist the commonwealth in this regard, and Mr. Yeltsin today accepted a variety of American proposals.
He and Mr. Baker said the United States, Russia and Germany would establish in Russia "an international science and technology center that would support scientists and engineers of the former Soviet Union to redirect their talents to non-military endeavors."
By financing peaceful research or commercial endeavors, the center seeks to minimize the temptation for nuclear experts in need of income to sell their services to aspiring nuclear powers like North Korea, Iraq, Iran or Libya.
The United States will contribute $25 million, out of the $400 million appropriated by Congress, to finance the center and its projects.
Germany and the European Community are expected to announce similar amounts for the center, which will be established in one or more of the military-industrial cities of Russia where nuclear scientists are concentrated. It will be open to scientists from all over the commonwealth.
 
A Capitalist Venture, Too?
 A meeting of experts is being scheduled next month to work out details of the institute, which the co-sponsors hope will attract private investors as well.
Then, the Russians have agreed to accept from the United States "25 safe, secure railroad cars designed to transport nuclear weapons" to be collected, dismantled and destroyed, a senior Administration official said. The boxcars will be modified to fit the republic's railroads.
As the nuclear weapons are taken to storage sites, they will be placed under bulletproof blankets that will also be supplied by the United States.
In addition, Washington will provide 250 large specialized containers for the overland transport of nuclear weapons, as well as smaller secure containers for weapons components.
When these arms are dismantled and destroyed, the highly enriched uranium and plutonium will either be entombed in underground bunkers to be monitored by the International Atomic Energy Agency or converted for use in nuclear reactors or research.
All these programs will be paid for by the $400 million, which was urged on the Administration by Congressional Democrats last year. At the time, President Bush did not push for the funds, but the Administration is now actively spending them.
 
No Decision on Space Defenses
 Mr. Baker and Mr. Yeltsin also discussed proposals for cooperation in their space programs, as well as in developing space-based defense technologies -- "Star Wars" equipment, in American terms. They reached no final agreement. Mr. Baker told Mr. Yeltsin that any such Russian-American cooperation would first have to be discussed with the Western allies.
At the news conference today, Mr. Yeltsin assessed his relationship with Mr. Baker, saying, "We are coming to know each other, and the Secretary and myself feel much more comfortable with one another than we used to be one year ago."
Bush Administration officials had at first been quite cool toward Mr. Yeltsin -- because of his less than fully successful first trip to Washington in September 1989, and later as he unseated the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in whom Mr. Bush had invested great faith and support.
In recent months, though, American officials seem to have grown slightly more comfortable in dealing with the Russian leader, though some still complain that his staff is occasionally chaotic and does not always work together.
On Tuesday, the Secretary of State is to meet with Russia's Foreign Minister, Andrei Kozyrev, and try to bridge differences in their countries' separate proposals for unilateral reductions in long-range nuclear missiles, beyond the levels already agreed to in the recently signed strategic arms treaty.

HEADLINE: War in 1990's: New Doubts;
Pentagon Plans Evoke Skepticism in Congress

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 17

 BODY:
By spelling out potential foreign conflicts that might draw United States forces into combat, the Bush Administration is headed for confrontation with a skeptical Congress over national security assumptions at the end of the cold war, analysts and Congressional aides said today.
In recent months, Congressional leaders like Representative Les Aspin, the Wisconsin Democrat who is chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, have pressed the Pentagon to provide its analysis of specific threats to American security in coming years, but the Pentagon leadership has declined.
 
'The Real Threat'
 When Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, sent their 1993 fiscal year budget request to Congress last month, General Powell said in an accompanying "national military strategy" document that "the real threat we now face is the threat of the unknown, the uncertain." 
 With the disclosure by The New York Times on Monday of internal Pentagon documents detailing the seven Pentagon "scenarios" for future foreign conflicts, Congress now has a working understanding of the underlying assumptions of Pentagon spending plans until the end of the decade.
The hypothetical conflicts include an Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia; a North Korean attack on South Korea; simultaneous assaults by Iraq and North Korea; coups affecting American citizens or vital interests in Panama and the Philippines; an attack on Lithuania by Russia, and the emergence of a new and aggressive superpower by 2001.
The scenarios, which are described as "illustrative" and "not predictive," are used internally by the military services to examine their needs and provide the underpinning for annual budget requests to maintain levels of forces and weapons to support worldwide American military and political aims. As such they become Administration policy, though the scenarios themselves may not be specifically approved by the President.
Though the Pentagon controls the war scenarios as part of its planning process, Congress controls the financing for forces and weapons through the military budget. The ultimate test of the Pentagon's view of potential conflict in the world thus is whether it will sell on Capitol Hill.
Pivotal factors in the Pentagon's planning are the projected intensity of the conflicts and and the Pentagon's anticipation that more than one could occur at the same time.
Some scenarios will draw criticism and others are likely to find support, analysts said.
A member of the House Armed Services staff said today that the prospect of Iraq's rebuilding its military and invading both Kuwait and Saudi Arabia in this decade, for example, "really strains credulity" and that a less intense Persian Gulf scenario might be more appropriate for force planning.
"We watch Iraq solely on a nuclear proliferation basis," the expert said, adding that planning for a contingency response in Panama or the Philippines seemed more sensible. "Any force has got to be able to deal with that."
 
'Base Force' of 1.6 Million
 A Pentagon official said Mr. Cheney presented Congress with his vision of a "base force" military of 1.6 million members in August 1990 and now, with the end of the cold war, he is apparently developing new war scenarios to justify that force.
The base force concept called for reducing the "force structure" of the cold war military by 25 percent and then modernizing it with a new generation of high-technology weapons. But after an initial budget saving between now and the middle of the decade, military budgets have to grow by tens of billions of dollars a year to keep up with Mr. Cheney's menu of forces and weapons, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates.
Several military experts who work on Capitol Hill said today that the major issue for Congress was whether to accept the Pentagon's view that the military ought to be large enough to fight two major regional wars simultaneously, in the Persian Gulf and Korea.
In the Kennedy Administration, Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara developed the two-and-one-half war scenario, which held that the United States should be prepared to fight the Soviet Union in Europe while also fighting a regional war in Asia or the Middle East and a smaller war in Latin America. The Nixon Administration, however, based its defense planning on a one-and-a-half war scenario, assuming the United States might have to fight the Soviet Union in Europe while also taking on a regional foe like North Korea.
 
'Major Adversary' Gone
 One expert asked, "If during the cold war we did not have to worry about fighting Iraq and North Korea simultaneously, why do we have to worry about it now when the major adversary has disappeared?"
A Senate staff member said General Powell had been making public statements indicating that the military did not see the need to plan for major and simultaneous regional contingencies. This expert said Congress was likely to seek either copies of the scenario documents or extract details them from Administration witnesses.
With the diminution of major military threats in the world, some members of Congress also are reluctant to cut too deeply or too quickly into military programs that provide jobs in their districts.
In an election year and with the economy still sour in many states, it may be that the Pentagon's scenarios will be judged to be quite believable, even too conservative.
Whatever the effects, as one House staff put it, "There are a lot of people up here who want to get this debate on a sound analytical footing to talk about specific threats." The disclosure of the scenarios, "makes it awfully tough for them not to," he added.

HEADLINE: Milken to Pay $500 Million More In $1.3 Billion Drexel Settlement

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
Michael R. Milken has agreed to pay an additional $500 million and a number of his former colleagues at Drexel Burnham Lambert have agreed to pay $300 million to settle many of the civil lawsuits arising from the failure of the brokerage firm.
Drexel's insurers have agreed to pay $100 million to settle the claims. With the $400 million that Mr. Milken previously put in a fund to compensate victims of his securities frauds, the total settlement is $1.3 billion. 
 Lawyers representing Mr. Milken, other Drexel executives, Drexel's insurance companies and the various parties suing them -- which include the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and many small investors who joined in class-action suits -- reached a tentative agreement on Friday. Federal District Judge Milton Pollack, who is presiding over the Drexel case, had ordered the negotiating parties not to discuss the matter until it was approved by the court.
But Judge Pollack confirmed the agreement in a telephone interview yesterday, after The Los Angeles Times reported that a tentative agreement had been reached.
"What we have is a term sheet that gives us the heads of agreement, and that's all we have at the present time," Judge Pollack said. "A final signed paper is to be delivered to me on or before March 2." He said terms of the proposed settlement had been mailed to more than 9,000 people affected by the Drexel Burnham Lambert bankruptcy.
How the settlement payments will be shared by the various claimants has not yet been determined.
Drexel, which came to symbolize the fast-money era of the 1980's, filed for bankruptcy protection on Feb. 13, 1990, in the largest collapse ever of a Wall Street firm. The firm had provided fuel for many of the biggest corporate takeovers of the preceding decade, often in the form of speculative debt known as junk bonds, which are corporate obligations of companies with low credit standing.
By making huge borrowings possible, secured by no more than rosy forecasts of future profits, Drexel helped transform the mentality of Corporate America.
 
Junk Bond Evangelist
 And Mr. Milken, an evangelist for junk bonds, became America's highest-paid executive. In 1987, he took home more than half a billion dollars from Drexel and succeeded in convincing investors that the extra-high interest rates on junk bonds more than offset the risk that they would not be paid.
Mr. Milken, now 45 years old, was sentenced last year to 10 years in prison for violations of securities laws and was barred for life from the securities business. Mr. Milken is expected, in some quarters, to try to use this settlement to seek a reduction of his sentence. Whether he will succeed is far from clear.
Assuming the proposed settlement is completed, Mr. Milken would pay a total of $900 million to various parties who contend they were injured by his business dealings. The $400 million he previously paid was part of a settlement of charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Of the additional $500 million, some will come from the liquidation of Mr. Milken's interests in various private partnership investments he controlled while at Drexel. He would also relinquish any counterclaims he might have against Drexel.
Another $300 million would come from other former executives of Drexel who have already been sued or expect to be sued. These include Leon Black, Peter Ackerman, Warren Trepp, Joshua Friedman and Marc Rapaport, among others. They have not disclosed how they will share the payment they have agreed to, half of which is due upon court approval and the other half a year later.
These men are also expected to draw on their private partnerships to raise cash.
The timing of the tentative deal is especially crucial for Mr. Milken and his fellow defendants. If they could settle the lawsuits as part of Drexel's re-emergence from bankruptcy, the bankruptcy code would afford them blanket protection against further lawsuits.
"That was the object," Judge Pollack said.
Without that legal protection, they could face numerous other suits and would have far less incentive to settle the charges against them.
A court hearing on Drexel's plan to emerge from bankruptcy is scheduled for March 5. Unless an agreement was reached this weekend, there would not have been adequate time for everyone involved in the case to be given reasonable notice, as bankruptcy law requires.
And since any postponement of the hearing would have caused lengthy delays in the bankruptcy case, the other parties in the bankruptcy would not have welcomed rescheduling the hearing just to accommodate Mr. Milken.
"We have written out something called 'a terms of agreement' that provides for basic payment terms and security and collateral, and it leaves some things open for drafting," said one lawyer who insisted on anonymity because of Judge Pollack's gag order. "You never know whether you'll get a definitive agreement till you've gone through that drafting exercise. But I think everybody thinks it's more likely than not this will carry through to a definitive agreement."
One sticky issue that still appears unresolved concerns how Mr. Milken would be allowed to satisfy the $500 million obligation he is assuming.
Mr. Milken must put up half the cash when the agreement is approved by the court, one-quarter a year later, and the final installment a year after that, under the terms of the agreement.
His lawyers fought hard to allow him to use his interests in Drexel's private partnerships, which they valued at $300 million, in lieu of cash, but they ultimately had to drop that demand when the other lawyers valued the stakes closer to $200 million and insisted on getting cash or cash equivalents.
 
Milken's Down Payment
 The understanding now is that Mr. Milken will pledge his entire interest in the partnerships as a down payment on his portion of the settlement. He would then sell the partnership stakes to raise some of the cash he will need for the settlement.
In a key concession, Mr. Milken agreed that it was his responsibility to make up any shortfall that might result when the assets are liquidated.
"That's really one of the big things we were fighting over, our insistence that it be all cash," said one lawyer who sued Mr. Milken.
Lawyers said it was that and similar issues that caused the settlement talks to become so protracted. After weeks of intensive negotiations in New York, where the case is based, the talks moved to Houston on Thursday. Judge Pollack has been in Houston for two weeks, because his wife is ill with the flu and had to be hospitalized there.
"The parties felt they had made about as much progress as they could without his intervention and decided there were some serious open issues and decided they'd see if by having him available to knock heads every now and then we could make some breakthroughs," said one of the plaintiffs' lawyers.
Another footnote to the deal is that if the settlement is completed it would let off the hook nearly half the former Drexel employees who had been sued last week by Drexel over the lavish compensation packages they received days before the brokerage firm went bankrupt.
The reason is that they were involved in the Drexel partnerships and would be relinquishing any claims to those assets as part of the deal. Employees who were not part of the partnerships, however, would still be liable if the lawsuit is successful.
For all the complexity of the negotiations, the Drexel case has moved along at a remarkable pace, largely because of Judge Pollack, an impatient jurist who takes a hands-on involvement in his cases.
"What I want to do is see if I can't complete the cycle I created in reaching a plan of reorganization in the bankruptcy, and to tie this into the bankruptcy," he said. "All of this is for the purpose of bringing about a substantial contribution to the Drexel bankruptcy estates so that it can be distributed to the people entitled to it."

International
 The U.S. and Canada are headed into a phase of confrontation, accusing each other of protectionist ways. The battlefield is beer, lumber and automobiles. Prime Minister Mulroney has complained, "We're getting sideswiped by American Japan-bashing," and has said Washington is playing "low-level politics." [Page A1.] 
 Russia's determination to strengthen the ruble reportedly began to yield some qualified success, with the Central Bank finally accorded some political credit as a steadying influence. The Government also sought to invite some additional confidence by announcing that it was hiring Goldman, Sachs as its chief adviser for inducing foreign investment. [A7.]
A group of private Saudi investors is close to an agreement to buy two Texas refineries and 500 gasoline stations from Fina, in a deal worth more than $500 million. [D1.]
McDonald's posters that appear to mock a French chef, Paul Bocuse, have led to open hostilities between haute cuisine and "le fast food." Mr. Bocuse has filed a $2.7 million suit. [D1.]
Japan's new Ambassador to the U.S. said the two countries were teetering at "a rather crucial period of mutual adjustment," as the United States only slowly gets used to the idea of sharing power with an economically resurgent Japan. [A7.]
 
Companies
Michael R. Milken has agreed to pay an additional $500 million and a number of his former Drexel colleagues have agreed to pay $300 million to settle many of the civil lawsuits arising from the investment firm's failure. [A1.]
Alan Ladd Jr. is eager to start making movies again at MGM, after months of dealing with the studio's tangled finances. [D1.]
A partial settlement has been reached in a lawsuit in which a Texas jury awarded more than $550 million in damages to investors in Miniscribe. [D5.]
 
The Economy
Regulators are preparing a new strategy of investing in some failing banks and savings and loans rather than taking them over and closing or selling them. Their goal is to find a less expensive way to deal with ailing institutions. But the plan carries financial and political risks because it would also bail out the owners. [D1.]
Hispanic factory and industrial workers get hurt on the job more often and more seriously than non-Hispanic white and black workers employed in similar jobs, according to state health officials, private research groups and the doctors who treat them. [A1.]
Files are routinely sealed in product liability suits, medical malpractice suits and suits involving toxic chemicals, and the information is not made available to agencies like the F.D.A. [D10.]
The Administration attacked the House Democrats' tax bill as a bad deal for the middle class that would bring them "25 cents a day for two years" in exchange for cuts in Medicare, farm and veterans' payments and, eventually, tax increases. [D1.]
 
Today's Columns
An enduring idea of modern finance is being challenged. Two scholars say they have disproved the theory, common among investors, that stocks more volatile than the market as a whole are the best performers. Market Place. [D1.]
Health insurers are adopting computer programs that are increasingly sophisticated to use in their struggle with doctors over procedures and fees. The newer programs create records called physician profiles, which insurers and health maintenance organizations cite to influence, reward or dismiss doctors in their discount networks. Milt Freudenheim: Business and Health. [D2.]
Many credit market analysts continue to question the sustainability of any kind of expansion, despite recent indications of economic revival. Kenneth N. Gilpin: Credit Markets. [D7.]
Some companies remain stalwart in their opposition to advertising. One that has just switched sides is the Putnam Companies, a Boston money management firm. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [D9.]

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Campaign Week;
New Hampshire Brings Tough Lessons Home

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEDFORD, N.H., Feb. 17

 BODY:
Even before the first votes were cast, let alone counted, New Hampshire had taught the candidates and the nation some home truths about 1992.
Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative commentator-turned-candidate, may take a big bite out of President Bush's hide or he may take a small one. Much will be made of the exact figures, without a lot of justification; in his 10-week campaign here Mr. Buchanan has clearly demonstrated the President's political vulnerability. What will become evident on Tuesday night is the extent of Mr. Bush's problem. 
 Mr. Buchanan's effort has also exposed the ineptitude of the White House political operation, at least in the eyes of the political professionals of both parties gathered here. With near unanimity, it has been faulted for poor advance work, pedestrian advertising and unimaginative themes.
Clearly, the storied Bush luck was missing this year. No incumbent would relish coming to New Hampshire to ask for renewal of his mandate in the midst of a devastating recession. But the President "ought to be able to take and hold the initiative against a neophyte," as a Republican consultant said, "and this President hasn't quite been able to bring that off."
The Bush campaign is stocked with skilled, experienced political operators, like Robert M. Teeter, the poll taker, who heads the team, and Richard N. Bond, the chairman of the Republican National Committee. So what is the matter? Some say Mr. Bush does not listen to them. Some say they have lost their touch. And some suggest, perhaps more persuasively, that techniques developed in the service of the master communicator, Ronald Reagan, simply do not work in the campaign of George Bush, a mangler of message.
Even if he goes no further than New Hampshire, Mr. Buchanan has already softened the President up for the Democrats by suggesting two avenues of attack: Mr. Bush is rich, indifferent and out of touch with the harsh economic realities of ordinary people; Mr. Bush has no core of beliefs.
In 1972, when the Vietnam War was highly controversial and Watergate was becoming so, President Richard M. Nixon sought re-election. He seemed vulnerable in February, and a pair of Republican Representatives challenged him in New Hampshire -- John Ashbrook of Ohio, a conservative, and Paul N. McCloskey of California, a liberal. Between them, they took 30 percent of the vote.
But Mr. Nixon went on to a landslide victory over Senator George S. McGovern of South Dakota in November. The Democrats had torn themselves apart in a nominating battle that went down to a procedural vote on the convention floor, never really rallied around their candidate and then were forced to replace their Vice Presidential nominee.
Whether the Democrats will be able to exploit the openings Mr. Buchanan has shown depends heavily on whom they nominate and how they do it.
None of this year's Democratic candidates is as divisive a figure as Mr. McGovern was, and the party is not split the way it was in 1972 over Vietnam. Things are always easiest for post-Franklin D. Roosevelt Democrats when hard times are the problem, as they are at the moment, because Democrats agree, in general terms, on what to do.
The party's biggest problem this time is that its best-known figures are not in the race. That may change, though the odds are still probably less than 50-50. But whoever is confirmed as the front-runner by Tuesday's results -- there cannot really be a front-runner until some votes have been cast -- will develop a lot of name recognition. Unknown when he started out, Jimmy Carter found himself hailed after Iowa and New Hampshire by hard-hat construction workers in New York City who had just seen him on television.
Probing questions and muckraking investigations follow notoriety, but so does money. Ask Bill Clinton.
That doesn't mean that he who wins New Hampshire wins the Democratic nomination. Estes Kefauver (1952) and Edmund S. Muskie (1972) and Gary Hart (1984) all found it impossible to transfer their popularity here to other states. Former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts obviously faces difficult problems in doing that, even if he wins a commanding victory here, because he will remain a New Englander who has never won elsewhere.
This week many questions will be asked. Can any of the candidates develop an effective appeal to blacks and other minority groups, who play no role at all in New Hampshire? Which ones will be able to find new, sharply drawn issues to set them apart from their rivals? Who will get the best start on raising the huge amounts of money needed on Super Tuesday, March 10, when 11 states vote, including dollar-draining places like Florida and Texas?
Whoever finishes first among the Democrats will have his work cut out, because none of the candidates and none of their organizations seem as fully developed as is usually the case by this stage of the race. The campaign started late, and so far it has not produced a candidate with a demonstrable capacity for growth or its share of backroom wizards like Eugene Pokorny and Richard Stearns in 1972 and 1976. But then there are still months left.

HEADLINE: The Bronx Accentuates the Positive

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
Although Marlene Reynolds shares a condition common to 1.2 million people, she'd just as soon keep it to herself.
"I don't want people to know I'm from the Bronx," she protested with a laugh as she leaned over the counter of the Bagel Cafe where she works in Co-Op City. "Everybody who is not from the Bronx thinks it's like that movie, 'Fort Apache.' " 
 Her neighborhood, the nearby residential enclave of Country Club, is closer in both spirit and geography to Westchester County than to the infamous 41st Precinct in the South Bronx. Nonetheless, a date recently told her that he was scared to leave his new luxury car on the street outside her home because he feared it would be stolen.
"That's the image they have of the Bronx," she lamented.
Her gentleman caller is not alone.
 
Population Increases
 In the years since it became America's pre-eminent popular symbol of urban hell, many things have begun to look up in the Bronx. Many things, but not the borough's image.
It does only so much for the Bronx's civic self-esteem to know that neighborhoods once leveled by arson and abandonment show strong enough stirrings of life that the borough's population increased from 1.1 million in the 1980 Census to 1.2 million last year. Or that entire communities have weathered the last two decades untouched by blight, functioning quietly and out of the glare of television cameras that venture into the borough to cover murders and mayhem.
Progress or no progress, many Bronx residents say they still feel like New York's municipal stepchildren -- natural father, Rodney Dangerfield. The latest insult came last month, when they learned that a drug-ravaged section of Manchester, England, was dubbed "The Bronx," prompting a chorus of protestsfrom civic groups and Borough President Fernando Ferrer.
"People still have the mental image of devastation and rubble strewn and abandoned buildings with decals on the windows," said Mr. Ferrer. "There had been a conditioning that nothing happened."
To help break that conditioning, some groups have begun efforts to burnish the borough's image. Positively Bronx, an association of business, cultural and educational leaders and the Bronx Tourism Council hope to bolster borough pride and attract investors, businesses and tourists to the Bronx. Next month, the city will unveil a program where each borough will receive the pro bono services of a major public relations company to help spur tourism.
"We have to do a better job of explaining to people the positive things that are in the Bronx," said Genevieve Brooks, the deputy borough president and a longtime community housing advocate. She was one of the moving forces behind the transformation of Charlotte Street from a rubble-strewn photo op for politicians to a quiet neighborhood of ranch-style houses. "If people cannot give us the credit we deserve, they should stop using us as their stomping grounds in movies," she said. "We are not a fictional borough."
Michael Gill, a management consultant who heads Positively Bronx, said the borough continues to attract immigrants and others seeking to carve their niche in society as part of the city's changing work force. "If you allow the Bronx, or any other inner-city area to be demeaned, we are ruining the strengths that made this nation great," he said. "The future of the city is very dependent on the future of the Bronx."
Turning around the image may prove more daunting than reviving moribund neighborhoods. "I wish whoever is doing it a lot of luck," said Roy Grace, the Bronx-born chairman of Grace & Rothschild, an advertising agency. "I think it's between the Bronx and Poland as to who has been the center of more putdowns."
But that could be used to the borough's advantage, he said. "When the expectations are so grim, the upside is very high if you just juxtapose it with the unexpected." For example, one could show pictures of attractive homes, then tell people the houses were in the Bronx.
"That gives you an enormous potential to get people involved and interested because their expectations are so different," he said. "They haven't been told the good things in so long."
The best place to begin changing the borough's image may be with its own residents, said Clive Chajet, chairman and chief executive officer of Lippincott & Margulies, a corporate image consulting firm. "The Bronx is more than the South Bronx," he said, fondly recalling a wedding he attended last year in the New York Botanical Garden that was as glamorous as any he attended in Europe. "Have the Bronx's people begin to develop some sense of identity and pride in the totality of the Bronx. One can't lie about the reality of the South Bronx, but put the reality of it in perspective with the rest of the Bronx."
While Mr. Chajet counseled patience to perceived slights like the recent Manchester flap, others have fought back with a sarcastic sense of humor. Mr. Ferrer recently urged Bronxites to decide which of their neighborhoods would like to assume the mantle of "Little Manchester."
"You know what?" he asked. "I don't think there'll be any takers."
Burton B. Roberts, the former Bronx District Attorney and presiding judge of State Supreme Court in the Bronx, recalled when fellow judges at a convention in Buffalo kidded him about the borough's crime rate, he bluffed and rebuffed them with an off the cuff reading of "An Ode to the Bronx." He claimed it was a lesser known work of Edgar Allan Poe, who lived for a while in a cottage off Kingsbridge Road:
 
I see thee in my dreams my dear beloved Bronx
 Thy face is to me fairer by far than the face of Yonkers.
 I love thy charm I love thy grace
 I love the beauty of thy face
 I love thee Bronx I love thee well
 Anywhere else? A living hell.
The stature of Poe notwithstanding, Sherwin Cloth said any efforts to boost the borough should focus on its current residents and attractions, with an emphasis on its ethnic diversity, suggesting a Bronx cookbook or tours into ethnic neighborhoods.
"Everybody in the Bronx is passionate," said Mr. Cloth, a Bronx-born public relations consultant and comedy writer. "But everything that has been done to promote the Bronx has been very Waspy. For example, the Hall of Fame for Great Americans is an area that people don't know anything about. It's about dead Americans that have nothing to do with the residents of the area." Don't ask him about Woodlawn Cemetery.
George Lois, chairman of the Lois/USA advertising agency, agreed that the borough should emphasize its successful native sons and daughters, as with the recent homecoming of the Mets slugger Bobby Bonilla. Mr. Lois, who grew up in Kingsbridge, flaunted his roots for a while when, inspired by Charles de Gaulle, he called himself "George of the Bronx."
"It didn't have that much of a ring to it," he admitted.
Of course, the ultimate in image changing would be to rename the borough, a step which Joel Portugal, a corporate identity consultant, warned strongly against. "The Bronx is a great name," said Mr. Portugal, a partner in Anspach Grossman Portugal. "It's a lot shorter than Manhattan and it's got a good sound at the end. No way anybody should change that name."
Call it what you want, Marlene Reynolds has decided she wants to move somewhere with less of an image problem.
"There's nothing for me here," she said. "I'm looking at possibilities in Las Vegas."

HEADLINE: For Hispanic Immigrants, a Higher Job-Injury Risk

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
Hispanic factory and industrial workers in the United States get hurt on the job more often and more seriously than non-Hispanic white and black workers in similar jobs, according to state health officials, private research groups and the doctors who treat them.
Most of the workers are immigrants and like immigrants historically, they take the hazardous, low-paying jobs that other Americans spurn. But studies in Illinois, California and New Jersey show that Hispanic workers, both legal and illegal immigrants, also have injury and illness rates that are two or three times higher than non-Hispanic white Americans who take the same jobs. Black workers suffer higher rates than whites, too, but lower rates than Hispanic workers. 
 Experts on health and safety in the workplace say that many Hispanic workers are young and inexperienced, usually with only grade-school educations and little knowledge of English. Employers rarely provide training in Spanish, so when operating complex machinery and handling chemicals, the workers run greater risks than other Americans. Being weak in English also makes it harder to find other work, so the workers are less likely to quit unsafe jobs than other Americans.
The safety experts say the workers invite exploitation. The workers often do not understand their rights in the workplace as well as other Americans, and the illegal immigrants among them fear deportation if they complain. And when illegal workers are injured on the job, they are less likely than other workers to get good care. Illegal or not, workers are entitled to medical treatment under the workers compensation insurance system. But illegal workers fear that a doctor or a hospital will report them and so they seek less-qualified care, the experts say.
"What we have here is a fairly vicious economic situation where employers are chasing lower costs, which leads them to Hispanic workers," said Joseph A. Kinney, head of the National Safe Workplace Institute, an organization here that promotes safer working conditions and closer government regulation of the workplace. "Part of the dictum of lower costs is to squeeze the people on wages, benefits and safety. Their expectations are low, so abuse is invited."
No one keeps national figures on the ethnic origins of workers who get sick or are injured. But several doctors and agencies have conducted studies that show the same phenomenon:
*Sidney J. Blair, the chief of hand surgery at Loyola University Medical Center near Chicago, conducted a study last year showing that 57 percent of Hispanic patients who came to him had the most serious kinds of work-related injuries, like crushings and amputations, as against 22 percent for non-Hispanic white workers. The study examined 103 Hispanic patients and 110 non-Hispanic patients.
*The New Jersey Department of Health found that the finger amputation rate for Hispanic workers was 52.8 for 100,000, as against 28.9 for 100,000 for blacks and 9.5 for 100,000 for non-Hispanic whites and that the fatality rate for Hispanic construction workers was 34.8 for 100,000 workers as against 24 for blacks and 10.6 for non-Hispanic whites. The studies involved finger amputations in 1985 and 1986 among a random sample of 134 workers in many industries, and 200 fatalities among construction workers in the state from 1983 through 1989.
*The California Department of Health, which requires that medical laboratories report blood tests showing elevated levels of lead, found that 49 percent of the workers in such reports had Spanish surnames, a proportion nearly double the state's 26 percent Hispanic population, said Linda Rudolph, a doctor with the department. The reports were on 4,000 workers with excessive lead levels at 328 businesses from the years 1987 through 1990.
*The Los Angeles County District Attorney's office has prosecuted 45 employers for serious workplace health and safety violations over six years, with most of the cases involving injuries to Hispanic workers, said an assistant district attorney, Jan Chatten-Brown, who added: "There's no question that a disproportionate numbers of workers who were non-English-speaking -- and most of them have been Hispanic -- got these injuries."
In Chicago, where about 20 percent of the population is Hispanic, Francisco Calito, a 40-year-old Guatemalan, is unable to work and collects $386 a week in worker's compensation for a shoulder injury he sustained at the Tommy Armour Golf company here, where he assembled golf clubs for that division of Hanson Industries. Mr. Calito slipped across the border at Brownsville, Tex., in 1970 in a van; five years later, he gained legal status.
Mr. Calito carries his left arm folded at waist level, and grimaces as he slides off his jacket. He tells a story of injury, intimidation and discrimination that differs only in the details from those told by other injured Hispanic workers.
"I made 2,300 golf clubs a day," he said. "I worked there 40 hours a week for 10 years." His job involved attaching golf club heads to their shafts. A machine, driven by rapid-fire pulses of compressed air, pounded the shafts onto the heads, which Mr. Calito held in his palm, against his shoulder.
After seven or eight years, he said his shoulder, which took the blows of the machine, began to ache. "I told them about the pain," he said. "They said, 'If you don't work, you'll be fired.' My supervisor would shake his finger at me. He would kick me. He would tell me, 'I don't like you because you're a Latino.' "
Mr. Calito said he stuck with the job because he needed the $5.50 an hour he was paid to support his family. "I worked for two years with the pain," he said.
One day in November 1990, he said, bending his arm, "my arm was like this."
"They sent me to their doctor," Mr. Calito said. "The doctor gave me a shot and uncrooked my arm. He sent me back to the company. Then the company told me I could not work. I went to another doctor who told me that little by little the bone had worn away. He said I have a frozen shoulder."
 
'Standard Operation'
 James Phillips, vice president for manufacturing at Armour, said there was no question about the seriousness of Mr. Calito's injury. "But I'm not sure what caused it," he said. "Other workers have been doing that job for longer than he has. It's a pretty standard operation done by a lot of companies, not just us."
Mr. Phillips said he had never heard Mr. Calito's charges of race-baiting. He said the company had a harmonious work force of white, black and Hispanic employees. "Kicking?" he said. "That's impossible. We're not running a sweatshop here."
No one may ever establish whether Mr. Calito was simply careless or whether he was driven too hard or improperly trained and supervised. But Kenneth S. Lewis, a lawyer at Lewis, Davidson & Hetherington, a firm here that specializes in minority-group workers' compensation claims, said, "What we see in many of these cases are unsophisticated workers put into situations that are extremely dangerous and put under pressure where they have to perform."
Molly Coye, director of the California Department of Health Services, said Hispanic workers were more vulnerable because of employers' reluctance to provide training and instructions in Spanish.
"Even in the same workplace, Hispanic workers have both more dangerous jobs and a higher risk of injury in the same job," she said. The state has begun several programs to persuade employers to provide training in Spanish, she said.
Illegal aliens are exploited the most, occupational health officials say, because an employer can threaten them with dismissal, reporting them to the Immigration and Naturalization Service and deportation.
Often these threats are empty, because employers face civil and criminal penalties for hiring illegal immigrants. And the employers can be fined hundreds of dollars a day for not carrying workers' compensation insurance. But the workers are usually not informed enough to call their employers' bluff, or they think that protecting the employer serves the interests of the worker as well.
"They are the type of workers who are threatened by exposure or other problems if they raise safety and health questions, or any other questions," said John B. Moran, an official of the Laborers Health and Safety Fund, a research group supported by business and labor unions.
 
Touch It and It Hurts
 David Perez, a 45-year-old legal alien from Mexico, has the scars of four operations on his left hand from an industrial accident. He lost his left little finger down to the second knuckle from an earlier accident at the same factory, which has since gone out of business.
Mr. Perez points to the spot where the thumb joins the inside of his wrist. "Just touch it with a finger, just a little, it hurts," he said. "My sleeve rubs against it and it hurts. Any movement I make hurts.
"I always keep it a little covered so people can't see it," Mr. Perez said. "I have problems with my family, my wife. How do I say this: She never wants to be with me because she's afraid she will hurt me. She's very different than she was before. The children always want to play with me, and I because of the pain am not in the mood to play with them."
Mr. Perez set dies into punch press machines that stamped out metal parts. He described the accident that mangled his hand this way:
"I was repairing a machine because the part was coming out wrong. I accidentally hit the pedal. My hand was pressed and it stayed there. I called the operator to help me get my hand out. They put it in reverse and it hit my hand again. I told the guy to get the boss, so that manually they could lift the machine and get my hand out.
"The boss, and he was a Latino, would always give the worst jobs to Hispanics and cut their salaries. According to him, they didn't give the same production as the ones who spoke English, which was a lie. We didn't know how to defend ourselves.
"After my accident, all the time I had discrimination. They would fire me, then call me back. When I went back, I did the same work, but it was impossible to do it well. They switched me to a job that was harder and paid less money."
Mr. Perez received about $200,000 in workers' compensation for the permanent damage to his arm and for the settlement of a lawsuit against the maker of the machine. Despite the injury to his arm, he still works, driving a small truck part time and earning about $190 a week.
In some cases, the workers and the employers do serve one another's economic needs. Together they have created an underground cash economy. It can invite more exploitation and injury, but also offers opportunity.
Now, a new group of illegal immigrants is entering Chicago and getting hurt at work.
"We see a fair number of undocumented Poles," said Dr. Steven Hessl, director of the Cook County Occupational Medicine Clinic, which caters to the poor. "I just saw one. He worked with chemicals and didn't want us to call the company. He was afraid the company would get him deported."

HEADLINE: NEW JAPAN ENVOY SEES CRISIS IN U.S.

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 17

 BODY:
Japan's newly appointed Ambassador to the United States described the relationship between the two countries today as teetering at "a rather crucial period of mutual adjustment," as the United States only slowly gets used to the idea of sharing power with an economically resurgent Japan.
The comments by the Ambassador, Takakazu Kuriyama, an Amherst-educated expert on the United States who until last year was deputy foreign minister, underscored the growing view here that relations are nearing a crisis because of growing trade tensions and the difficulty the United States has in accepting its diminished influence in the post-cold-war era. 
 President Bush's attempts on a trip to Japan last month to persuade the Japanese to buy more American automobiles and parts led to complaints in the United States about Japan's trade practices. That was followed by remarks by Japanese political leaders questioning the work habits and competence of American workers.
 
Places Burden on the U.S.
 Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa even characterized American workers as lacking a work ethic, a comment that reflected a widespread view in Japan that America has lost its way economically but has yet to face up to the seriousness of its decline. These exchanges have brought to the surface an unusual level of bitterness and disillusionment that some leaders have tried to paper over, but which Mr. Kuriyama acknowledged.
Mr. Kuriyama, who assumes his post in mid-March, suggested that the burden for improving relations rests largely on the United States. He indicated that Japan was well on its way toward opening its economy, while the United States had yet to come to grips with its economic troubles or the implications of its dependence on Japan.
He said the United States needed to address two key economic problems: overconsumption, as exemplified by the yawning Federal budget deficit, and under-savings, as indicated by the level of indebtedness and the need to import capital to finance the deficit.
 
'Managing' Trade
 While some Japanese business leaders have been critical of the agreement reached during President Bush's visit for Japan to import a specific amount in automobiles and parts, Mr. Kuriyama said he accepted such "managed trade" as a way to tame the growing difficulties in the relationship.
Mr. Kuriyama also warned that campaigns in the United States to have consumers purchase only American-made goods could harm the relationship. "If buying American becomes a widespread discriminatory practice, our whole relationship is going to be in trouble," he said.
Mr. Kuriyama offered no short-term solutions. He said he wants to pursue three aims at once: better management of the periodic crises in the world and in the bilateral relationship, help for each side to understand the other better, and enhancing what Japan likes to call the "global partnership," which often means greater consultation with Japan before it is asked to finance United States initiatives.
"If we fail to work together and cooperate with each other, I think the whole world will suffer," he said.

HEADLINE: Poll Shows Deeper Roots in New York Region

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
After two turbulent decades of moving in and out of the New York region, its residents have grown less restless as they have aged and become more attached to their homes and communities, according to a New York Times Poll.
The new sense of roots in the region is most evident in the suburbs, where 53 percent of respondents in the poll said they had no plans to leave their communities. In contrast, when they were asked the same question in 1978, 43 percent of the region's residents outside the city said they had no plans to leave. 
 New York City residents expressed a stronger inclination to move, with a majority saying they planned eventually to leave the city. Their responses, compared with those in previous polls, suggest that dissatisfaction with their lives in the city has grown since the 1980's.
 
Demographic Shifts
 But in a region of 17.3 million people -- about 10 million of them in the suburbs -- experts said the poll results reflected deep, long-term demographic shifts that might have buttressed the area's social and economic base, even as it struggled through the most protracted recession in decades.
They point first to the aging of the huge generation born after World War II, which has matured from its adventuresome years of young adulthood into a era of heightened concerns about family living and financial security.
"People who have children have become more committed to their communities, and that is good news for the region," said Barbara Lawrence, vice president of the Regional Plan Association, a nonprofit research organization based in Manhattan. She added that a sharp increase in the number of families where both spouses are dedicated to their jobs and careers has made relocation more disruptive and less frequent.
For some respondents, the reduced level of mobility reflected in the Times poll may merely result from financial frustration. If fewer people plan to move, the experts said, it may be because they are unwilling to sell their homes during a steep real estate slump, because their job opportunities elsewhere have narrowed, or both.
Still, the economic repercussions of a more stable population bode well for a region that suffered steep losses in the 1970's and that as recently as the late 1980's was unsettled by fear of a flight of highly educated professionals as a consequence of thousands of layoffs on Wall Street and widespread business failures.
"Retaining our labor force is critical if we are to generate a proper rate of economic growth," said Regina Armstrong, an economist who specializes in the New York region. In an appraisal echoed by other economists and urban planners, she said the results of the poll were "on balance, good news."
Some of those who participated in the poll said their heightened commitment to the New York region resulted from skepticism over opportunities elsewhere, and a growing faith that the grass at home was as green as it gets.
"A decade ago I thought New England was such a wonderful, funky, high-tech area," said Richard Sauerhaft, a 35-year-old marketing representative who lives north of the city in Hastings-on-Hudson. "But now we've seen what happened to the economy up there, and I'll stay where I am."
The telephone poll was conducted from Nov. 2 to 12 with 824 adult residents of New York City and 1,726 adult residents in the 14 counties immediately surrounding the city in New York State, New Jersey and Connecticut.
The margin of sampling error for both the city and the 14-county region is plus or minus three percentage points.
More than 20 of the participants were re-interviewed for this article.
When the people in the poll were asked if they had "any plans to eventually leave" their communities, 53 percent of the people who now live in the New York region outside the city said they had "no plans to leave." In contrast, when the same question was asked in a 1978 poll, 43 percent of the suburban participants said they did not plan to leave.
For those in the recent poll with plans to move, 5 percent said they would move closer to the New York; 18 percent farther from New York, and 20 percent to other parts of the country.
 
Moving 'Somewhere Else'
 Residents of New York City were asked: "Looking ahead four years, if it were entirely up to you, would you want to be living in New York City, or would you want to be living somewhere else?" Sixty percent said they wanted to be "somewhere else."
The restlessness of city residents was measured in three previous polls in which the same question was asked. In 1981, 48 percent said they would prefer to move. In 1985, near the height of an economic boom, the percentage who wanted to leave had dropped to 42. In 1990, it had increased sharply, to 59 percent.
To be sure, people's perceptions of mobility and future changes in their lives often miss the mark of practicality. Several of the city residents said in interviews that even though they would prefer moving away, it was not likely to happen.
"Unfortunately, this is home," said Beth Diker, a 39-year-old psychologist who lives in Hollis Hills, Queens, and was one of the poll participants who said she would move if she could within four years.
"New York City comes down to the basic hassle of parking, shopping and renewing a driver's license, and it's more intense than any place I know," she added. "But I'm not going any place."
Another question in the poll, designed to gauge people's sense of roots, asked if they could easily "pull up stakes" if they found themselves in a position where they "had to move."
 
Deeper Roots in Suburbs
 The responses revealed slightly deeper roots in the suburbs, where 53 percent said moving would be "a problem." In the city, 47 percent said they would have a problem moving.
To whatever extent the attitudes reflect a long-term shift in mobility, the poll comes after a sweeping reversal in population patterns over the last two decades, particularly in New York City.
According to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the region lost 961,000 residents during the 1970's, with by far the biggest outward migration from the city, which lost 823,000 people. Experts say the largest losses came during the mid-1970's, when the city was near bankruptcy, crime and drug use were rising sharply and other serious urban problems emerged.
But from 1980 to 1990, the agency said, the region regained nearly a third of what it had lost, with New York City emerging once again as a magnet. The city gained 252,000 residents, an increase widely attributed to its robust economy in the mid-1980's, which attracted many from elsewhere in the United States, and to a sharp increase in foreign-born immigrants.
Other studies show that the frequency of moves into and out of the New York region has begun to taper off from a high rate in the mid-1980's. In an analysis of its own business, the Allied Van Lines Corporation, a major moving concern, said its shipments to and from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut fell to 26,805 in 1990 after exceeding 30,000 during each of the previous four years.
 
Restless Residents
 Experts attributed the restlessness of New York City residents to a combination of forces that have always made it one of the most transient of urban environments.
"If you had data from 50 years ago it would be consistent," said Kenneth Jackson, professor of history at Columbia University who has written extensively on the evolution of New York and its region. "This is a city of renters, which attracts people who don't sink roots and who eventually move on."
Perhaps typical is Patricia Fall, a 25-year-old advertising sales representative who is living in her fourth studio apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan since moving to the city from Washington, D.C., in 1988. In the poll, she said she would prefer to be living in the city in four years.
"It is easy to fall in love with New York," she said in an interview. Nonetheless, she said she has reached a conclusion that is shared by many of her friends: "Marriage and children would make a big difference, and I would refuse to raise kids here."
The experts said a growing sense of stability in the suburbs may have more important and longer-term implications for the region.
"Some of the reasons will be with us for a long time to come," said James Hughes, a professor of urban planning at Rutgers University in New Jersey. He said that many of the suburbs around New York had entered a "third phase" since the mass migration that followed World War II.
 
The 'Ozzie and Harriet Years'
 During those "Ozzie and Harriet years," he said, a preoccupation with family life melded with frenetic economic growth that gave middle-income people a high degree of mobility. By the 1970's and 1980's, he added, the most restless of generations had entered the job market of transcontinental transfers and career moves, and a real estate market that encouraged people turn over homes quickly.
But now, he said, "the suburbs of the 1990's have become a place where people want to raise kids and grow old."
The perception of permanence is not shared by everyone.
"Most of the people I know are itching to get out, but they are stalled because they can't sell their houses," said Michael Smith, an envelope sales representative who has lived in West Babylon since 1950. He sold his home this month and is planning to leave the region.
 
List of Complaints
 Topping his list of complaints about Long Island living are its traffic jams and property taxes. Mr. Smith and his wife, Virginia, are considering moving to the coastal area of North Carolina or Florida, and he said they would rent another house for a year while plotting their move.
The only constraint now, he said, is finding a job he will accept in one of the areas where he wants to live. "At the moment, things are tough all over," he said.
In Hastings-on-Hudson, Mr. Sauerhaft and his wife, Doreen, have two toddlers and a mortgage to pay on the house they bought in 1989, near the peak of the region's real estate boom. He said he did not want to move, even if he could.
"I do get the sense that all that shuffling of people in and out has slowed down, and maybe that's a good thing," he said. "The New York area is a still a hub, and I think it's as good a bet as any."

HEADLINE: In Minnesota, Pressure Builds for a Health-Care Insurance Plan

BYLINE: By ISABEL WILKERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ST. PAUL, Feb. 15

 BODY:
As politicians in Washington jockey for advantage in the debate over access to health care, Minnesota is working toward its own solution, a universal health-care plan that would subsidize the working poor, force insurers to cover people in high-risk groups and require greater cost efficiency.
For weeks, Democrats and Republicans here in the Minnesota capital have been negotiating a compromise measure to introduce during the legislative session that opens Tuesday. 
 Protests and opinion polls suggest that Minnesotans worry about health care more than about education or taxes, although only about 7 percent of Minnesotans are not covered by some sort of health insurance. And legislators fear that if they do not come up with some kind of plan this term, voters will get back at them in November, when all 201 seats in the Minnesota Legislature are up for grabs.
"There is a sense that the Legislature has to act," said Lois Quam, an insurance executive and the chairwoman of a state advisory committee set up to recommend legislation.
"There is enormous pressure to take something home for the '92 election. There is a sense of urgency from Minnesotans because people feel vulnerable and unprotected."
About 200 people showed up Friday in the Capitol Rotunda for a rally demanding action on health care. Many told stories of losing coverage or facing premiums that had grown to half their income.
About 30 other states have health-care legislation under consideration. Some measures would create state-run insurance programs and others would require employers to either buy coverage for their workers or contribute to a state insurance pool.
 
Last Year, a Veto
 But Minnesota has come closer to enacting such a sweeping measure than any other state in the three years since Oregon created a plan, now awaiting Federal approval, to expand eligibility for Medicaid, ration medical services and require employers to buy coverage for their workers.
Proposals in most other states are still being studied or are stalled in committee. But last year, the Democratic-led Legislature in Minnesota approved by fairly wide margins a bill that would have gradually introduced an optional state-run insurance program with a low-cost benefits package, put limits on private-market premiums and directly subsidized the working poor.
The bill was vetoed by Gov. Arne H. Carlson, a Republican, who said it would cost too much.
The first-term Governor is one of the few state politicians not up for re-election this year, but he has his own problems with the voters. A Minneapolis Star-Tribune poll taken last month found that he had a disapproval rating of 55 percent, the highest such rating of any governor in the 48 years the poll has been taken. The poll has a margin of sampling error of 3.5 percent.
Governor Carlson made it to the executive office by the quirkiest of circumstances. He became the Republican nominee in the final days of the 1990 gubernatorial campaign when the original nominee, John Grunseth, dropped out after accusations of sexual improprieties. Mr. Carlson campaigned for only nine days and defeated Rudy Perpich, the Democratic incumbent, 50.1 percent to 46.7 percent.
With his own popularity slipping, Governor Carlson now appears willing to work out some kind of agreement on health care.
 
The Governor's Goals
 He told the negotiators working on the bill that he wanted to increase access to the private insurance market rather than see the state go into the insurance business. He has endorsed subsidies and state income tax deductions for low-income Minnesotans and price controls on private premiums. He also has endorsed so-called healthy lifestyle discounts for people who, for example, exercise regularly or do not smoke.
Otherwise, he has essentially left the Republican negotiators to represent his views and has left the legislators alone to do their job.
"He's committed to getting something passed this year," said Jill Sammon, the governor's legislative relations director. "He feels there is a need to get health care to everyone but that we can't bankrupt the state to do it." The state Government is facing a $340 million budget deficit.
Much of the bill he vetoed, however, is still on the table along with the more modest proposals from insurance groups and the governor.
Whatever comes out of the session this year will not go so far as to put all health coverage immediately in the hands of the state, principal negotiators say. Although employers would be encouraged and enticed to provide insurance for their workers, the legislation is unlikely to require it, as Hawaii has done since the 1970's.
The Minnesota plan will likely be a hybrid, negotiators say, one that involves state subsidies for low- to moderate-income people, strict cost controls and a prohibition of underwriting practices that either effectively lock out small businesses and very sick people.
Under the Democrats' bill, insurance companies would no longer be able to refuse to cover people on the basis of such things as gender, occupation or preexisting condition, a provision that most of the negotiators agree upon.
The emphasis on underwriting practices is a distinctive feature of the proposals in Minnesota. Speaking of last year's vetoed legislation, Ronald Pollack, executive director of Families U.S.A., a consumer health advocacy group in Washington, said the state went further in trying to change health care insurance than any other state. "Minnesota is not just prohibiting the denial of insurance but is seriously trying to prohibit discriminatory pricing," he said.
The loudest critics of such a plan are insurance companies who say that price controls will send many insurers out of the state and that assigning all residents to the same risk pool regardless of age or health status will make the healthy bear the burden of the sick.
The private insurance lobby proposes a stripped-down benefits package for small businesses, arguing that most uninsured people are not covered because they work for small businesses that cannot afford to insure them.
"The key is to help the Main Street merchants -- the bakery shop, the hardware store, the transmission shop with six to eight employees -- to buy insurance for their workers," said Ralph J. Marlatt, president of the Insurance Federation of Minnesota, a trade group of private insurers.
The pressure for change is strong n a state that has a reputation for social innovation and already has one of the highest insurance participation rates in the country. The state has been a leader in the movement toward health management organizations and 93 percent of Minnesotans carry some type of health insurance, compared with a figure of 86 percent for all of the United States.
But about 370,000 Minnesotans still are without health coverage at any given time. In 1990, 11,000 were denied treatment because they did not carry insurance. And many people with insurance are not adequately covered or cannot afford premiums that sharply outpace inflation and wage increases, legislators and health care experts say.
Legislators say that because the state is already further ahead than most, it should be easier to fill the gap. The main question facing legislators is how to pay for the plan.
The sense of urgency in Minnesota reflects the turns the debate has taken nationally. "We are no longer talking about whether we need a national health-care plan but rather what type is needed," said Dr. Joel Weissman, an instructor in health-care policy at Harvard Medical School. "We are no longer talking about mending the safety net, but rather providing more insurance opportunities for people so they don't fall in the net to begin with."

HEADLINE: New Plans For S.& L.'s And Banks

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 17

 BODY:
Federal regulators are preparing a new strategy of investing in some failing banks and savings and loans rather than taking them over and closing or selling them.
The regulators, whose goal is to find a less expensive way to deal with ailing institutions, are being prodded by a law passed by Congress last year that requires the authorities to step in earlier when lending institutions are troubled. 
 But the plan carries high financial and political risks because it would also bail out the owners of troubled institutions.
"The bottom line is we want to save taxpayers money in a reasonable way and perpetuate rather than liquidate institutions," said John E. Robson, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. "This is being offered as an alternative to liquidation."
 
High-Level Meetings
 The new approach, to be outlined this week in the Federal Register, was developed in several meetings last week between regulators and top Administration officials.
By investing in weak institutions, the Government hopes to nurse them back to health and make them attractive to buyers. This approach might also ease the nation's tight credit by keeping the banks and savings associations operating and under Government supervision.
When some institutions have been shut or merged, outstanding loans have been called in, and some say that has contributed to tight credit.
 
Rights of Shareholders
 Under the new plan, the Government would get a substantial stake in an institution in return for its investment. Whether the Government would hold voting rights in these companies and how the plan would work is still being discussed, but it is clear that existing shareholders would have the right to decide whether to accept the investment.
A Government investment would dilute the value of existing shareholders' stock, but at the same time would strengthen the company, helping to protect private investments.
The financial risk, some critics say, is that the Government stake in the future of such institutions could ultimately prove more costly than traditional bailouts if the economy slumped further and if already shaky real estate holdings brought down even more banks and savings institutions.
Government protection of shareholders is also expected to encounter sharp political challenges on Capitol Hill and from some Presidential candidates, who might argue that taxpayer money should not be used to protect investors from what may have been their own poor judgment. Other critics might be healthier institutions and those already seized.
But senior regulators say there is already significant momentum for the new approach, which is known as "early resolution assisted mergers." Congress laid the groundwork for the approach when it approved legislation in November directing regulators to intervene more quickly to rescue weak institutions.
The plan is still at least a few weeks from being implemented, with some details to be ironed out. In recent days, an agreement in principle appears to have been reached.
"I think you can now say it's a likely approach," said T. Timothy Ryan Jr., director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, which oversees savings associations and has advocated the plan for many months. "It will be controversial because anything that is new and at all bold in Washington is controversial, and not without some risk."
 
A Looming Deadline
 Mr. Ryan said the program would be for institutions that "are heading south" but not yet insolvent. He said the regulators were motiviated to adopt the new approach by a looming deadline. They are required to clean up the industry by September 1993, when the cost of the cleanup switches from Treasury borrowings to the savings and loan insurance fund, which is financed by premiums paid by the industry.
While none of the officials planning the new strategy have expressed objections to it, some have privately expressed concerns about the political fallout of rescuing shareholders in an election year. The fear is that some shareholders of troubled institutions could be involved in wrongdoing that contributed to the problems.
Other experts are clearly troubled by the new strategy.
"It's obviously difficult for the regulatory authorities, but their short-run goals are competing with their long-run goals," said James R. Barth, a former Government economist who has written extensively on the bailout and now teaches at Auburn University.
"What they are trying to do is prop up institutions and keep existing credit arrangements intact," he said. "But many people think there are too many banks. How is this supposed to faciliate an exit from the industry if the Government is pumping money into them?"
Variations on the Government investment approach are already being experimented with. Last month, regulators decided to put $1.2 billion of capital into the Crossland Savings Bank of Brooklyn rather than sell or shut it, with the hope that its plight would improve in two to three years and it could be sold. In that case, however, the shareholders lost their investment because the institution was already insolvent when the Government stepped in.
While regulators say the new approach could be applied to scores of institutions that are solvent but ailing, they are looking first to several of the nation's largest savings associations, all in California, that have fallen below the regulatory requirements for adequate capital, the investment cushion used to make up for losses.
These include two big Los Angeles institutions, Glenfed Inc., which has $21 billion in assets, and Calfed Inc., with $19 billion. Another large California savings association in trouble, the Homefed Corporation of San Diego, is not considered a candidate for the program because by some measures it has already become insolvent.
 
Sharing Profit and Risk
 Outlining how the program might work, Mr. Ryan said the Government would provide infusions of capital and give existing stockholders either "hope certificates" or stock warrants that would enable the stockholders to enjoy any profits if the institutions were turned around by allowing them to buy more stock at a lower price. The Government would also share in any upswing and bear the risks of further losses.
"You need to leave the shareholders with some tangible inducement in order to get them to participate," he said.
Mr. Ryan said the new capital would make shaky institutions attractive to prospective buyers, which have preferred to wait until institutions fail and then pay less for them and have their worst loans taken off their books.
 
Hearing Is Planned
 The notice in the Federal Register will give the public 30 days to comment on how such institutions should be selected and the best way to treat the shareholders. Officials are also planning to hold a hearing, but no date has been set.
Officials said the new effort was not intended to resemble the mission of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, the agency set up during the Great Depression that spent billions of dollars to prop up some 6,000 banks by buying their stock.
"I don't think anyone here has proposed restarting the R.F.C.," Mr. Robson, the Deputy Treasury Secretary, said. "It's not something we're prepared to do."

HEADLINE: Building Jobs Underpaid, Officials Say

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
Taking advantage of hard economic times, when many people will work for less pay, a growing number of New York City contractors are slashing their bids to win public works contracts and then paying illegally low wages on public works projects.
The contractors, who are competing for scarce work in a depressed region, avoid losing money on their bids by paying wages that are drastically below prevailing rates, city officials said. 
 In one case under investigation, the officials said, a New York City contractor underpaid more than 100 construction workers, including laborers, steam fitters and carpenters, by $2.5 million. The workers were paid from $10 to $12 an hour, when they should have received $20 to $24 an hour at the prevailing rate, investigators said.
The city declined to name the contractor while the investigation is under way.
State and city labor laws require that wages and health benefits of workers on public construction projects be no less than those provided under local collective-bargaining agreements with unions, even if the workers are nonunion. Contractors who pay wages below prevailing rates can be fined or barred from doing business with the city and state.
 
A Tripling of Complaints
 "These contractors are getting sleazier and sleazier because they know that in this weak economy people will work for close to nothing just to put food on the table," said Rosaria Esperon, New York City's assistant deputy comptroller for claims and adjudications, who is responsible for enforcing wage rules on city contracts.
Last year, the Comptroller received 261 complaints of underpayment, compared with 163 complaints in 1990 and 89 complaints in 1989.
Outside New York City, other areas in the region have also seen a rise in underpayment complaints. Mark Molisani, a spokesman for the New York State Department of Labor, said that in the last year the agency's Public Works Bureau has received a growing number of complaints from asbestos workers who work on public construction projects on Long Island.
To Frank McArdle, managing director of the General Contractors Association, a trade group for the heavy construction industry, "Workers are being mistreated -- forced to do very dangerous work for very little pay."
Some contractors are going to great lengths to hide illegal underpayment. The contractors often pay workers in cash to avoid any record, or they pay full wages by check but require workers to give back a portion in cash, city officials said. In one instance, a contractor paid construction workers half the prevailing rate by requiring two workers to split one paycheck.
Construction workers often feel they have little choice about pay rates.
Simone Peele, a 30-year-old Manhattan construction worker, said that VMT General Construction paid her $8.25 an hour to do rehabilitation work on city buildings in Harlem in 1989. While the prevailing wage for such work was $28.17 an hour, Ms. Peele said she accepted the lower wage because she needed the money.
"I complained to the foreman but he pointed out that I was not in the union and that I was black and that I was a woman and that I should be lucky to have the work," Ms. Peele said. "I felt humiliated and violated but I needed a job."
 
Many Illegal Immigrants
 Ms. Peele and 18 other construction workers have filed a complaint with the city's comptroller, charging VMT with underpayment. Ms. Peele, who is a spokeswoman for the group, said many of the complainants are illegal immigrants from Mexico and Poland who were paid $5 an hour for the work.
A person who would only identify himself as an official with VMT said in a telephone interview that, as a matter of policy, the construction company pays employees who work on city contracts the prevailing union wage and that VMT is cooperating with the Comptroller's investigation.
The city's Comptroller Office has been flooded with so many complaints of underpayment in the last year that its staff has been delayed in investigating them, Ms. Esperon said.
The agency currently has eight people who process the complaints, which take from six to eight months to resolve. A few years ago, before the sharp increase in complaints, the time was three to four months, Ms. Esperon said.
Traditionally, about half of all complaints prove to be valid, Ms. Esperon said, but in the last year about 75 percent of underpayment complaints received have resulted in contractors' losing the city contracts, being fined or being barred from further business with the city.
 
Asbestos Company Cited
 The Comptroller recently found, for example, that the Apex Contracting Company had substantially underpaid employees who worked on contracts to remove asbestos from city buildings in Queens, Staten Island and Brooklyn from 1989 to 1990. The contracts were worth $1.3 million, Ms. Esperon said.
While the prevailing union wage for asbestos removal is $22 an hour, Apex paid its workers between $10 and $16 an hour and refused to give the workers benefits worth an additional $5 an hour, Ms. Esperon said. Several workers filed complaints against Apex, and the Comptroller, after reviewing the company's payroll records, ordered the concern to pay employees $113,000.
A former Apex asbestos worker, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is an illegal immigrant, said that despite the potential hazards of removing asbestos materials, which can cause lung cancer, he agreed to work for $12 an hour because he has to provide for a wife and four children. "I decided to file a complaint when my wife said to me: 'Honey, you are risking your life to do that work. The least they can do is pay you what you're worth,' " the worker said.
Apex, which has filed for protection from its creditors under the Federal bankruptcy law, has yet to reimburse the employees, the Comptroller's office said. Repeated telephone calls to Apex's offices in Brooklyn duringin the last week were not returned.
Prevailing wage rules have been controversial with many contractors and builders, who maintain that the rules inflate the costs of public projects by millions of dollars because they set an artificially high floor on wages. Still, more than 30 states and the Federal Government have some kind of prevailing wage law.
 
Many Construction Setbacks
 The problem of illegally low wages is only the latest setback for the city's ailing construction industry, which has been racked with unemployment in recent years because of dwindling public and private projects. Union and industry officials estimate that half of New York City's 90,000 construction workers are unemployed.
The construction industry has also been hurt by the city's inability to put major capital spending projects out for bids. As a result, delays have meant the loss of at least 15,000 jobs in the last year, industry officials said.
The city's Environmental Protection Department, for example, failed to let more than $600 million in budgeted contracts last year to repair sewers and water mains. Local economists estimate that the water and sewer contracts could have created 8,000 jobs.
At the same time, industry officials said that Mayor David N. Dinkins's recent proposal to cut the city's capital budget by $3 billion would cost the construction industry from 21,000 to 35,000 jobs in the next four years.
"There are so many unemployed construction workers out there that many people are forced to take whatever work is available at whatever prices," said Mr. McArdle of the contractors association.
Mr. McArdle expressed concern that the city's Comptroller was not doing enough to enforce the prevailing wage rules. He said more investigators and case workers were needed to process the growing number of complaints. "Where's city government when you need it?" he said.
Ms. Esperon of the Comptroller's Office said that the agency's budget was limited, and that it could not afford to hire more case workers and investigators to look into underpayment complaints.

HEADLINE: From L.I. Teller Machines to Gas Stations, Suburban Robberies Are on the Rise

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: VALLEY STREAM, L.I., Feb. 14

 BODY:
When Kevin Dowd peered over his shoulder and saw the dull gray glint of an automatic pistol, his fingers began to tremble.
He had been standing at an automatic teller machine, withdrawing $100, when two youths buzzed themselves in behind him. It was 8 P.M. 
 "What about it," one youth said and pointed the gun. Mr. Dowd began thinking of his wife, Lorinne, and his year-and-a-half-old son, Chris, and wondered whether he would ever see them again.
But in a moment it was over. The youths took Mr. Dowd's cash and ran to a waiting car. And when he was safe once more, what struck Mr. Dowd was that the most terrifying instant of his 34 years occurred not on the mean streets of New York City but on a genteel village shopping strip in a placid suburban neighborhood where his family had lived for a quarter of a century.
A mugging in the city is still far more likely than a robbery in the suburbs. But while the number of robberies is on the decline in the city, suburban robberies -- from gas station holdups to purse snatchings to armed thefts of luxury cars -- are on the rise, in some cases to record levels.
And the rise in suburban robberies -- a pattern seen in the last year across the New York metropolitan area and around the country -- is raising concerns by criminologists and victims alike of a creeping urbanization of life in the suburbs as big-city problems, as well as city criminals, follow the middle class to the suburbs.
During the first 11 months of 1991, the number of robberies reported in New York City, which had ranked first in robberies among the nation's large cities, fell by 1.6 percent, compared with the year before.
But across the city line, the number of reported robberies last year showed a rise of 17 percent in figures covering most of Long Island, where the Nassau County Executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, regularly decries the "New York Citification" of suburbia by city "thugs and hoodlums."
In New Jersey, the state police reported a 5.6 percent decrease in robberies in urban areas and a 10 percent increase in suburban areas. Robbery is the crime most closely watched by many criminologists because it usually involves what people fear most about crime -- sudden violent attack by a stranger.
 
'No One Feels Safe'
 "No one feels safe anymore," said Jeannette Caccavale as she shopped on Rockaway Avenue in Valley Stream, across the street from the Home Federal Savings Bank, where Mr. Dowd was robbed. "The suburbs aren't what they used to be."
After 34 years in the neighborhood, Mrs. Caccavale said, she now thinks twice before going to the local mall alone and spends much of her afternoon chauffeuring her grandchildren to places her own children felt safe enough to walk to on their own.
In Nassau County, where the police recorded 1,762 robberies last year, a record, the use of guns in robberies has been rising sharply for several years. Last year shots were fired in 44 Nassau robberies, almost double the number the year before. In areas covered by the Suffolk County Police Department, 1,571 robberies were recorded last year.
Detective Sgt. Michael Fleming, commander of the county robbery squad, said: "I don't think any community is as safe as it used to be, and we are no exception. But by and large we are a safe community comparatively speaking, and I think the criminals stand a very good chance of being caught, convicted and heavily sentenced."
The pattern in Nassau County first surfaced in October, when the Federal Bureau of Investigation released crime statistics for the first six months of 1991. These showed an increase of 6 percent in robberies in large cities and a 13 percent increase in suburban areas.
In New Jersey, state police figures from the same period showed a decline in urban areas and an increase in suburban areas. While New Jersey counties often include a mix of urban and suburban areas, Essex County, a predominantly urban county that includes Newark, reported a 10.5 percent drop in robberies, while Middlesex County, a predominantly suburban area, reported a 15.3 percent rise.
Planners and criminologists attribute the increase to the spread of urban ills like drug addiction, which has taken hold in the suburbs, coupled with a deep local recession that weakens the social fabric and makes the wealthy suburbs attractive prey for city criminals.
"It's like what Willie Sutton, the great sage of American criminality, once observed when asked why he robbed banks," said Lee Koppleman, executive director of the Long Island Regional Planning Board. "That's where the money is."
Richard H. Girgenti, the New York State Director of Criminal Justice, said interpreting a one- or two-year trend is often difficult. But he said crime patterns in the suburbs tended to follow by a year or two similar patterns in the city.
A plateauing or small decline in crack use in New York City might be responsible for the drop in robberies there, he said, a decline that has not yet been felt in drug cultures in the suburbs. Eventually the suburban crime rate might fall as well, he said.
But he also said that the tough economic times might be bringing more city criminals to the suburbs. According to the Nassau County police, 65 percent of the suspects arrested by the county's robbery squad lived in New York City.
Thomas A. Reppetto, the president of the Citizens Crime Commission, a private New York group that monitors crime and law enforcement, said that while the differences in crime rates between the city and the suburbs were shrinking, "the suburbs are nowhere near as dangerous as the central cities are."
In 1990, he said, a New York City resident was more than 10 times as likely to be a victim of a robbery than a Long Islander, and six times more likely than a resident of Westchester County. Nationwide, a city dweller was almost eight times more likely to be robbed than a suburbanite.
"If New York City had the murder rate of Nassau and Suffolk, we would declare a civic holiday," he said. "The suburbs are beginning to get a little more like the city, but by no means are they like our great cities."
A day after he was robbed last week, Mr. Dowd, an assistant branch manager at a Manhattan stock brokerage firm, stayed home, at his white frame house in Lynbrook, to take care of his son Chris, putter about the house and brood a bit over what happened.
He had stopped by the bank on his way home from the Valley Stream station to pick up some cash. It was not late at night, and he had not given security a second thought. Then he saw the gun and heard a voice tell him to face the cash machine and not turn around.
 
A Security Camera
 Mr. Dowd knew that a security camera was built into the machine, and he moved slightly to one side so the camera could record the faces of the robbers behind him. When they ran out of the bank lobby, he ran after them, not knowing quite why, and saw them jump into a small dark sedan and drive away.
"I'm shaking and not as mad as I thought I would be," he said. "Living so close to the city you hear about drug problems and crime rising and things like that. You hear it happening all around you, but you never think it would happen here."
Suddenly he began to worry about safety and pay attention to some of the signs of decline in the neighborhood -- graffiti near the Valley Stream train station, shoplifting at lthe mall -- and listen more closely to relatives who are urging him to move out to the East End of Long Island, far from the city.
He began to wonder why he did not see more police officers patrolling Rockaway Avenue -- at a time when county budget cuts were forcing reductions in the number of county police officers.
"I used to get that warm cozy feeling coming home," he said. "Now I feel it is not as safe."

HEADLINE: Despite Pact, 2 Yale Unions Go On Strike

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, Feb. 17

 BODY:
Classes were canceled, library hours curtailed and dining halls closed today after two unions and a group representing 1,300 graduate students at Yale University went on strike to force the university to bargain with the graduate students.
It was an odd alliance, since the unions had reached a settlement with the university on new contracts at 7 A.M. today, and the graduate-student organization is not a recognized union. 
 But officials of the unions, which represent 3,600 clerical, technical, maintenance and cafeteria workers, had said they would strike through Wednesday in a show of sympathy for the graduate students represented by the Graduate Employees and Students Organization, who complain of low wages, lack of representation and other problems with the university.
The strike had loomed for weeks. The 2,200 graduate students at Yale, like those at many other universities, often seek work as teaching assistants in undergraduate courses as a way of meeting their tuition costs.
The custom creates a mutually dependent relationship for professors, undergraduates and the graduate students, said a professor of English, Hazel Carby, who was circulating a faculty letter today that called on Yale to recognize the graduate-student group. "They're indispensable to our teaching," Dr. Carby said.
Yale officials have said repeatedly that they will not recognize the graduate students' organization as a bargaining unit, although the group is welcome to join regularly scheduled issue-related talks that are to resume on Tuesday.
"We do not regard collective bargaining as the proper relationship between an academic institution and its students," Yale's president, Benno C. Schmidt Jr., said at a news conference this afternoon.
A noon rally on Beinecke Plaza attracted several hundred protesters, chanting slogans like "Yale, Yale, negotiate/You're becoming second-rate!" Many wore buttons signifying their membership in the unions and wore protest placards across their chests.
Gordon Lafer, a spokesman for the graduate-student group, said 75 percent of teaching assistants canceled their classes or moved them off-campus today to honor the picket lines.
 
'We're One for All'
 Martha K. Matzke, a university spokeswoman, said about 70 percent of clerical and technical workers reported for work today, and 25.37 percent of maintenance and cafeteria workers did so.
Some union members said they were surprised to find themselves on picket lines shortly after hearing there was a new contract.
Others were more supportive. "We're one for all and all for one," said Hattie Minor, an administrative assistant in the department of epidemiology and public health. "They supported us, and I wish them well."
Many undergraduates watched the rally from the sidelines.
 
'Immature and Selfish'
 "I'm not sure I completely agree with the stoppage of teaching," said a freshman, Stephen Chang, whose English 120 class, normally taught by a graduate student, was canceled today. He said he was sympathetic to many of the demands from the graduate students, but added,"If it goes beyond this week, I might begin to lose sympathy for them."
Douglas Beck, a senior, opposed the strike, saying: "It's immature and selfish for the graduate students who are looking toward a Ph.D. that's going to take them to some sort of lucrative profession to expect Yale workers to lose three days of wages, in the middle of February, in the middle of a recession.
"I agree that graduate students are treated very poorly at Yale, but I don't think forcing others to go out on strike is the way to go."
The last major strike at Yale occurred in 1984, when dining hall workers left their jobs for 10 weeks.

HEADLINE: Democrats' Tax Plan Under Attack

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 17

 BODY:
The Bush Administration attacked the House Democrats' tax bill today as a bad deal for the middle class that would bring them "25 cents a day for two years" in exchange for cuts in Medicare, farm subsidies and veterans' benefits and, eventually, tax increases.
In an interview, Richard G. Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, amplified the attacks President Bush has made in recent days on the Democratic measure, which is destined for a House vote next week. 
 Democrats argue that a temporary two-year tax credit of up to $400 a year for families, paid for by permanent higher taxes on individuals with taxable incomes of $85,000 and up, would result in higher taxes for only the top 1 percent of all taxpayers.
But Mr. Darman contended there would inevitably be pressure to extend the tax cut beyond two years, even though it would have little value to recipients. Each member of a family of four would be getting only about 25 cents a day, he said.
 
'The Heart of the Middle Class'
 While House Democrats have maintained they want only a two-year bill as a way to help stimulate the economy. The Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, said Sunday on the NBC television program "John McLaughlin's One on One" that he felt any tax credit given to the middle class should be permanent.
After two years, Mr. Darman predicted, the Democrats would extend the reach of the 35 percent maximum tax rate proposed for individuals with $85,000 of taxable income and couples at $145,000. "It will take them another nanosecond," he said, to reduce the $85,000 minimum "right toward the heart of the middle class."
Mr. Darman said the Democratic measure would necessitate cuts in other domestic programs because it would break the 1990 budget agreement by failing to raise as much money as it paid out in each of the first two years. Democrats do not disagree, but they say that the plan is acceptable because it would balance out over six years.
Besides, the Democrats say, without accounting tricks the Bush Administration's proposals for a large capital gains cut and accelerated depreciation for business investments would also create an imbalance.
The dispute is another example of the opening long-range fire that attends the tax and growth debate in its early Congressional stages, where each side is looking at least as much for winning political arguments as for legislative solutions.
No one, in fact, expects the House Democrat's measure to become law as now written, even if it passes in the House, which is not a certainty. Some degree of compromise with the Bush Administration, and with the Senate, await the measure if any of its provisions are to end up in the tax code. The Senate Finance Committee is scheduled to begin writing its version of the measure on Feb. 25.
But ultimately, the budget director has the last word in the accounting judgments of whether the terms of the 1990 budget act are met, and Mr. Darman said the Democratic bill "would trigger a very large sequester -- 27 to 30 billion."
A sequester requires offsetting spending cuts. The cuts "would have to come from entitlement programs, excluding Social Security," he said. "They would come principally from Medicare, from farm payments, from veterans, from student loans."
Mr. Darman also criticized the one percentage point corporate tax cut in the Democratic proposal, saying he doubted that one economist in a hundred would consider that an effective way "to stimulate jobs and growth."
Most economists, he said, would prefer either a tax credit for business investment, or the type of accelerated depreciation for new business investment that the Administration has proposed.
Democrats have argued that investment credits cut unevenly between industries and companies within industries, and distort rational economic thinking. Cutting the maximum corporate rate from 34 to 33 percent and the corporate alternate minimum tax from 20 to 19 percent, they maintain, gives all businesses some benefit.
Mr. Darman argued that the Administration's investment proposal and another proposed measure that the Democrats have rejected, a $5,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers, would "accelerate purchases" and stimulate the economy.
He also criticized the Democrats' proposal for taxes on capital gains, which would index such gains for inflation. He said the approach was not as likely to stimulate investment in high-growth industries as the Administration's proposal to make 40 percent of any capital gain exempt from taxation.
Mr. Darman said, moreover, that by accepting a capital gains cut that was anything more than trivial in scope, the Democrats "are abandoning their so-called issue of principle."
"They have decided, in their terms, to favor the rich," he said.
Democrats argue that their plan has a targeted, even more generous approach intended to encourage investment in small business. Indexing for inflation is only fair, sound tax policy, they say, to make sure that people are not taxed simply because of inflation that does not represent income. Mr. Darman acknowledged that indexing was "desirable."
Still, he ridiculed the bill as a whole: "The middle class gets a chance to get 25 cents a day for two years in exchange for Medicare cuts, student loan cuts, farm payment cuts, fewer jobs and eventually higher taxes. This is not a good deal."

HEADLINE: Saudis Are Close to Deal for Big Part of Fina

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
A group of private Saudi investors is close to an agreement to buy half of the refining and marketing system of Fina Inc., including 2 Texas refineries and 500 gasoline stations, for more than $500 million.
The refineries are in Port Arthur and Big Spring, with a capacity of more than 200,000 barrels a day. The gas stations, about 200 of them owned and the rest franchised, are in Texas and Minnesota. 
 If the deal is completed, it will be the first big Saudi investment in the American refining and marketing industry since Texaco Inc. and the Saudi national oil company, Saudi Aramco, announced in June 1988 that the Saudis would buy half of Texaco's refining and marketing network in 23 Eastern and Gulf Coast states. That deal, for which the Saudis paid $812 million in cash and an additional amount in oil that Texaco said was worth $1 billion, covered 3 refineries, 49 terminals and 1,450 service stations bearing the Texaco name.
Experts said the Texaco deal, like the proposed sale by Fina, gives the Saudis a hedge in oil profits, which sometimes come from producing oil and sometimes from refining and selling it, and provides a more secure outlet for Saudi oil. During oil shortages, the deal would increase the security of consumers because the jointly owned American refineries would have first call on oil supplies.
Fina, based in Dallas, issued a statement yesterday confirming its talks with the Arabian Petroleum Company, the private Saudi group, whose main shareholder is Delta International, an investment group based in Jidda, Saudi Arabia, with offices in Dallas and Vienna, Va. Fina is 85 percent owned by Petrofina S.A., based in Brussels. The deal apparently would not include Fina's petroleum reserves or its chemical division.
"At this time, it is premature to say when conclusion of the negotiations can be anticipated," the statement said. But a Saudi executive involved in the proposed deal, who refused to be identified, said the transaction was "close to confirmation."
Fina's headquarters was closed yesterday. Attempts to reach the company's public relations officials were unsuccessful.
The talks were reported yesterday in Petroleum Intelligence Weekly and Middle Eastern Economic Survey, prompting the Fina statement.
The proposed investment comes at at time of uncertainty for the American refiners because of progressively stricter specifications on gasoline required by the Clean Air Act and a crackdown on refinery emissions.
 
Big Costs Ahead
 "It doesn't surprise me that Petrofina would want to sell," said William Randol, an oil analyst at First Boston. "The industry is facing huge capital expenditures for reformulated gasoline." He predicted that refiners would have negative cash flow for the next few years.
Buying a refinery would be unattractive for the Saudis, he said, "unless they just think it's a nifty way to tie up a place for their crude."
Some experts say that in the next few years the refineries will have to spend $1,000 on average for each barrel of capacity to meet the new requirements. But analysts say the refineries that survive, probably the most modern, may prosper in years to come because they will face less competition. Fina spent heavily on its two refineries in recent years.
The Saudi executive said the deal would have the tacit approval of the Saudi Government because it would conform to the Saudi's long-term goal of providing outlets for their crude.
"Obviously, an international company with access to crude in Saudi Arabia and access to gas stations in Texas and Minnesota is a company that will support maintaining supply," the Saudi executive said.
Any deal would come with a crude-oil supply contract, ostensibly offering oil at the same price that other buyers receive. But experts in the field say that crude-oil supply contracts to companies partly owned by the supplier often offer price guarantees or other breaks that lower the risk to the refiner.
Separate from the joint venture with Fina, Arabian Petroleum is considering building a plant in Saudi Arabia that would make methyl tertiary-butyl ether, a gasoline additive that can be used to meet the Clean Air Act requirement for higher oxygen content in fuel. The additive, which is made from petrochemicals, could be sold on the open market or supplied to the joint venture with Fina.

HEADLINE: It's Al vs. Mario, and Truce Is Off for a Day

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL

 BODY:
Vying over one microphone, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato went head to head yesterday in a spontaneous debate that was more like a verbal prizefight than the usual political discourse.
A surprised audience at the annual meeting of the Association of Towns of the State of New York joined the fray, hooting, hollering and jeering, as "Al" and Mario" -- as they oh-so-sarcastically called each other -- clashed over government spending policies. 
 "It was kind of explosive," said Michael Erlandson, the town clerk of Ellicott. "A couple of women said they thought they might have come to blows."
It wasn't New Hampshire, where Mr. Cuomo's supporters are waging a write-in campaign to draft him for president. It wasn't Harvard University, where Mr. Cuomo spoke recently so close to the New Hampshire media market. But it was very New York, with the state's leading Democrat and Republican -- whose one-time informal non-aggression pact has frayed in recent months -- going at each other with the politesse of two cabdrivers who had just crunched fenders .
The brief confrontation occurred in front of nearly 2,000 town officials gathered at the New York Hilton for an annual meeting and training session, usually devoted to rather dry subjects like tax assessment or solid waste management. Mr. Cuomo, Mr. D'Amato and Democratic Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan were all scheduled to give consecutive welcoming speeches.
 
No Holds Barred
 The fight for the microphone started as Mr. Cuomo took exception to the earlier remarks of Mr. D'Amato, a Republican. As the Governor spoke, the Senator marched up to the microphone, the audience gasping and laughing. "I'm delighted to be here," the Senator said, interrupting Mr. Cuomo. He added, "Anytime the Governor finishes his speech and wants to give me ----."
"I'm finished," Mr. Cuomo interrupted.
"Are you really finished?" Mr. D'Amato shot back.
Then it was no holds barred: two politicians literally grabbing for a common mike, and a common audience. Mr. D'Amato rolled his eyes and shook his head as the Governor spoke. Mr. Cuomo kept his hand wrapped around the Senator's shoulder. Gestures flew. Organizers seemed confused.
"It was so spontaneous and unexpected, our officers all started getting up because they didn't know what to do," said Patricia M. Walsh, the association's manager of education and training. "Our president was trying to get close to the mike but couldn't because the two of them were at the mike. We just backed off."
 
'A Really Good Discussion'
 Mr. D'Amato drew cheers as he said: "At the Federal level and at the state level we've got to cap spending. We've got to make workfare and not welfare and we've got to cut the fat out of the bureaucracy . . ." As the Governor attempted to get the mike back, he shouted, "Mario, I thought you were done!"
Mr. Cuomo moved in. "Let's have a really good discussion," he said. "O.K., you suggested you would like to cut federal spending ----."
"No. Cap. Cap. CAP the spending," the Senator retorted.
"Does that mean, Al, that you will not give us any more help than you're now giving us at the state and local level?" the Governor asked.
"Mario, it means that across the board we can't say cut spending but don't cut my favorite program, because that's what we've been doing," the Senator replied.
"No, no you didn't answer me," Mr. Cuomo insisted. "When you say cap, that means you're not going to give the state or the locals any more money?" Then his voice slowed down for emphasis: "Are you also going to cap the aid to foreign governments? Just tell us clearly." This parry brought the Governor his own round of cheers.
 
Rave Reviews
 At another point the Governor chastised his audience for approving Mr. D'Amato's cry of "workfare, not welfare."
"Of course, you cheer. You're not on welfare," he told the audience.
Together, the two debated welfare spending, the Federal deficit, recession, bureaucracy. Then Mr. Cuomo left the hall and spoke of his regrets that he was not competing in the Democratic presidential primary in New Hampshire. "If I had a budget I would be running," he said. "It's as simple as that."
For years Mr. Cuomo and Mr. D'Amato have maintained close ties despite their partisan differences. But their relationship took a decided turn for the worse over the past few months as the Governor considered whether to seek the presidency and the Senator geared up for his own re-election campaign.
Yesterday, the audience enjoyed the show. "I haven't seen anything even closely resembling it," Ms. Walsh said.

HEADLINE: U.S.-CANADA RIFTS GROW OVER TRADE

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, Feb. 17

 BODY:
Despite a three-year-old free-trade agreement, the United States and Canada are headed into a new phase of confrontation, accusing each other of protectionist ways. The battlefield is beer, lumber and automobiles.
Even as the neighbors negotiate with Mexico about expanding the agreement to include all of North America, the tensions are growing, heightened by political sensitivity about jobs lost through imports. The lingering economic slumps and approaching elections in both Canada and the United States add more pressure. 
 Prime Minister Brian Mulroney has complained, "We're getting sideswiped by American Japan-bashing." He has also said Washington is playing "low-level politics."
One Canadian fear is that in response to complaints in Washington, Japan will shift to the United States investments it intended for Canada.
But for all the recent tough talk, most trade analysts still expect the free-trade agreement to hold, even though either side can end it with six months' notice. Trade between the two countries was $200 billion last year, the greatest volume between any two countries, and many economists say the trade accord has been an important factor in increasing trade. They also say the pact has been beneficial to both sides.
Canadians are troubled by what they see as continued American trade harassment -- complaints motivated by domestic politics -- when they thought they had bought an era of peace under a trade agreement that would end all barriers by 2000.
Mr. Mulroney, whose Conservative Government is still fending off opposition charges that the free-trade agreement has not been good for Canada, has long argued that his special relationship with President Ronald Reagan and then with President Bush would safeguard fair play by the United States.
 
Using Tough Language
 Now he is using tough language to criticize Washington. After the United States Customs Service ruled earlier this month that Hondas made in Canada were subject to a special duty, Mr. Mulroney promised a "shin-kicking campaign" to get the ruling reversed.
Simon Reisman, the man Mr. Mulroney appointed to lead the Canadian free-trade negotiating team, said recently: "The Americans are bastards. They're behaving like real thugs these days in protecting their interests."
Mr. Reisman, now a private consultant, has long been critical of American trade policy, but his blunt outburst, made in a newspaper interview here and widely reprinted in the Canadian press, underscores Canada's feelings of resentment.
The auto dispute began with a Customs Service complaint that Honda Civics assembled in Alliston, Ontario, lacked the required 50 percent content of parts made in North America to qualify for duty-free export to the United States.
A preliminary ruling now subjects those cars to a 2.5 percent import duty. The Alliston plant makes about 105,000 cars a year, of which 75 percent are exported to the United States.
In the Canadian view, Washington is signaling that if the Japanese want to avoid such harassment in the future, they should build their Hondas in the United States.
The Bush Administration has also threatened to impose punitive duties on Canadian beer.
The Stroh Brewery Company and the G. Heileman Brewing Company brought a formal complaint against Canada that led to findings against Canadian beer-selling practices by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the organization of more than 100 nations that oversees world trade.
 
Punitive Duties Planned
 Armed with a GATT report citing Canadian limits on outlets where imported beer can be sold and the imposition of higher costs and markups for imports, the United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, sent a notice to the Federal Register a few days after Christmas that the Administration intended to impose punitive duties on Canadian beer by April 10.
But Ottawa has a countercomplaint pending at GATT, asserting that beer distribution laws in some states and some Federal and state taxes unfairly curb Canadian beer sales in the United States.
The Canadians say the tax credits that many states offer companies, based on annual production of beer in the state, discriminate against them. The Anheuser-Busch Companies, controlling nearly half the beer market in the United States, for example, gets $21 million of annual tax savings from a brewery in Columbus, Ohio, the Canadians complained to GATT.
Canadian beer executives say a GATT panel has now ruled in favor of the Canadians. The ruling has not been made public, and officials of GATT and of the United States and Canada have declined to comment. If the reports are true, it would be the first time that American state laws were found in violation of international trade laws.
 
Lumber in Dispute
 Another dispute involves lumber, with the United States complaining that Canadian producers get unfair subsidies through low tree-cutting fees on Government land, even though the fees were completely altered after earlier American complaints.
Washington has already begun a regulatory investigation that could result in duties of up to 15 percent on Canadian lumber. Ottawa has reacted angrily and taken its case to the GATT watchdogs in Geneva.
Administration officials stoutly deny that they are waging any campaign of harassment against Canada. They agree that there are some problem trade sectors but stress that the bulk of the huge trade is untroubled.
"Our view is that the U.S. is observing the letter and the spirit of the free-trade agreement," said an American official, who insisted on anonymity. "We are, of course, defending U.S. interests in the context of U.S. trade laws, but perceived disparities are being investigated under the normal process of U.S. law."
During a recent visit to Washington, Canada's Minister of External Affairs, Barbara McDougall, said she had taken up Canadian complaints with the State Department and had served notice that Canada would retaliate "by using exactly the same tools they are using."
In both countries, it is illegal for imported goods to be sold below the cost of production or home-market prices, a practice known as dumping. Punitive duties may be assessed against foreign companies found to violate these rules.
The United States has traditionally applied antidumping laws very aggressively against Canada and other countries. Yet Canada's International Trade Tribunal found in October that Heileman, Stroh and the Pabst Brewing Company were dumping in British Columbia, causing Canadian brewers to suffer losses.
Lawyers for the American companies said they intended to challenge that finding, which lifts the price of American six-packs in British Columbia by $1.
Canada's tit-for-tat strategy both through GATT and the use of its own dumping law could hasten a settlement in the beer dispute, many analysts here think, or at least cause the United States to defer its planned April 10 retaliation.
 
Consumers May Benefit
 "Once the two GATT panels have ruled," said Mike Palmer, an analyst at Sanwa McCarthy Securities, "the general view is that the two countries will hammer out some kind of agreement."
This could be good for consumers in both countries. Beer prices have farthest to fall in Canada, where, because of provincial selling restrictions and other forms of protection, as well as generally higher alcoholic-beverage taxes, prices are nearly twice as high as in the United States.
One reason for the higher Canadian prices is a ban on selling beer in a province if the beer is not produced in the province. Moosehead beer, for example, brewed in New Brunswick, is available throughout the United States but not in Ontario.
"No Canadian brewer will deny that the market has to open up here," said Barry Joslin, senior vice president of Molson Breweries, Canada's leading beer company. "But we need a little time."

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
3-Way Meeting Starts
DALLAS, Feb. 17 (Reuters) -- Negotiators from the United States, Canada and Mexico have begun their biggest push yet to finish a North American free trade agreement. For the first time since the countries started serious talks in June, the chief negotiators and their 19 subgroups that concentrate on specific issues are meeting in the same place for a week.
 Their chief task in the meeting that began today is to resolve several hundred disputes they wrote into a first draft of the pact last month.
 "The environment is excellent," said the top United States negotiator, Julius Katz, the deputy trade representative. "But I have to say frankly I don't think we will have resolved all of the issues by the end of the week."

HEADLINE: Market Place;
A Study Shakes Confidence In the Volatile-Stock Theory

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG

 BODY:
One of the most enduring ideas of modern finance is facing its most serious challenge. Two scholars of finance say they have disproved the theory, common among investors, that stocks more volatile than the market as a whole are the best performers.
Eugene F. Fama and Kenneth R. French, business professors at the University of Chicago, traced the performance of thousands of stocks over 50 years but found no link between relative volatility and long-term returns. The many investors who try to beat the market by buying widely swinging issues are misguided, they say. 
The importance of "beta," the investment community's term for a stock's volatility relative to the market, has long been under challenge. But it is still closely watched by analysts, and business students are still taught that they can earn higher returns by buying stocks whose swings are wider than the market's.
"The fact is," Professor Fama said in a recent telephone interview, "beta as the sole variable explaining returns on stocks is dead."
Some still favor relatively volatile stocks, among them William F. Sharpe, a retired Stanford University professor who won the 1990 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science for theories based on beta. "It is a remarkable set of empirical results about what happened in the past," he said of the University of Chicago study. "But I am not willing to make investment decisions based on the theory that there is no relationship between beta, properly measured, and expected returns."
If Professors Fama and French are right, however, the impact could be far reaching. Some highly volatile groups of stocks that have enjoyed wide followings -- airlines, for example -- could lose a portion of their appeal if beta-believing investors side with the professors.
Additionally, many executives of publicly held companies have taken the view that if their own company's stock is more volatile than the market as a whole, any project they invest in -- from a lowly piece of new equipment to a huge joint venture -- must generate an extra high return to compensate investors for swings in the stock's price and earnings. The professors' work could force many companies to rethink the way they approach capital spending, finance scholars say.
Finally, many publicly held utilities have used beta to justify rate requests. They figure the returns that investors demand, given their companies' betas, and develop rate structures that allow them to earn these returns. But recognizing that their low betas tend to argue against large rate increases, a growing number of utilities had already turned to other approaches. More will probably do so if the research of Professors Fama and French gains currency.
And if investors decide to quit following betas, other theories of market behavior are likely to gain influence. "What we are really taking about is opening the floodgates to a whole new generation of research into what truly drives stock prices," said Anthony B. Sanders, an Ohio State University professor of finance who is currently a visiting professor at the University of Chicago. "Once you hammer a model like the old one closed, you generate all sorts of additional academic interest."
Professor Fama has already won worldwide recognition for his efficient-markets theory -- the notion that because investors all have essentially the same information it is impossible to consistently earn returns greater than those justified by the risks.
Professor Sharpe used Professor Fama's theory as an assumption to develop the capital-asset pricing model, which links returns to risk, as measured by beta.
Professor Sharpe says that a diversified portfolio can reduce the risks peculiar to individual companies -- that General Motors stock, for example, will be hurt by a strike. Investors, therefore, earn no rewards for bearing this risk, according to the Sharpe theory.
But investors do earn higher returns for bearing the other type of risk, known as market risk, Professor Sharpe says. This risk, which remains even after an investor diversifies, depends on how much an individual stock is dragged up or down by the market as a whole. Stocks like that of the biotechnology company Genentech, which have betas of more than 1.0, are more volatile than the market, while stocks like that of the power company Consolidated Edison, which have betas of less than 1.0, are calmer than the market.
To calculate market risk, or beta, finance professionals compare changes in the prices of individual stocks with changes in market indicators like the Standard & Poor's 500- stock index. Professor Sharpe and his followers say that in general, the higher a stock's beta, or volatility relative to the market, the greater its long-term returns.
Professors Fama and French disagree. Their paper, just published by the University of Chicago's Center for Research in Security Prices, says that long-term returns depend not on beta, but on company size and price-to-book ratios. Smaller companies, as measured by the market value of their shares, and those with low prices relative to their book values have in fact outperformed the market, they say.
The professors theorize that investors view smaller companies as more vulnerable to economic downturns and therefore demand higher returns. They also say that low price-to-book ratios typically reflect financial problems, another reason for investors to demand higher returns.
Professors Fama and French are by no means the first to fire an intellectual salvo at the capital-asset pricing model. Since Professor Sharpe developed the model in the early 1960's, a broad array of rival theories has emerged to explain stock price movements: the January effect, which says that stocks usually gain at the beginning of the year, to the weekend effect, which says stocks generally perform poorly on Mondays. Most recently, the arbitrage pricing theory says that stocks are driven by powerful economywide forces like unanticipated inflation and spikes in interest rates.
But finance experts say that Professors Fama and French have presented the most conclusive evidence against beta.
"What they have proven fairly rigorously is what other academics have been talking about for some time," said Richard Roll, a finance professor at the University of California at Los Angeles, who with others developed the arbitrage pricing theory.

HEADLINE: For Farmers, a Boom in Blooms

BYLINE: By HAROLD FABER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EAST GREENBUSH, N.Y., Feb. 14

 BODY:
At Becker's Farm here, flowers, house plants and seedlings fill five greenhouses, with red and pink geraniums flourishing in the 80-degree moist heat. Outside, a new parking lot has been completed and a new greenhouse is under construction.
Becker's Farm is part of the fastest-growing segment of agriculture in New York and the Northeast -- supplying trees, shrubs, plants and flowers for homeowners. 
 "In the Northeast, it's the only segment of agriculture that is growing, and it is growing by leaps and bounds," said Dr. Carl F. Gortzig, professor of horticulture at the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Cornell University in Ithaca.
In New York, greenhouses and nurseries are the second biggest cash producers for the state's farmers, behind the state's dairy industry. But they are the largest segment of agriculture in New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island.
With $343 million in farm income from nursery and greenhouse products, New York ranked fourth in the nation in 1990, behind California, Florida and Texas, according to Federal statistics. New Jersey was 10th, with sales of $227 million and Connecticut far down on the list, with sales of $134 million.
 
New Houses Need New Trees
 The nurseries grow trees and shrubs outdoors for planting outdoors. Greenhouses, which occupy much less space, produce potted plants for hanging in homes as well as seedlings of flowers and vegetables for home gardeners.
The United States Department of Agriculture reported a combined national farm income of $8.1 billion in 1990 from growing trees, shrubs and plants, up 11 percent from $7.3 billion the year before. The figures for 1991 are not yet available.
The major reason for the growth of the industry is that the sales of nursery and greenhouse products are tied directly to housing starts, which boomed in the 1970's and 1980's, according to Dr. George J. Wustler, specialist in floriculture at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J.
In addition, the environmental movement has brought about a renewed interest in planting trees by both individuals and corporations, and supermarkets are selling large numbers of potted plants and cut flowers.
"There is a strong link in the sale of plants through landscaping architects to new offices and corporate headquarters," Dr. Gortzig said. "Today, any business instead of paving up to its front door is landscaping to give it an environmental image."
The current recession has affected the nursery business more than greenhouses, said Dan O. Barnhart, executive director of the New York State Nursery and Landscape Association. Because of the drop in housing starts and a consequent decrease in planting of trees and shrubs, he estimated that nursery sales might be down as much as 17 percent last year and so far this year.
But greenhouse sales have proved to be more immune to the economic downturn, experts said, because people continue to buy plants and flowers on holidays and other occasions and to work in their home gardens.
"Oddly enough, it seems that when times are difficult, people find flowers an attractive but modestly priced product," Dr. Wustler said.
Despite the economic cycles, more young people are entering the nursery and greenhouse business, said Robert Mungari, director of the Plant Industry Division of the State Department of Agriculture and Markets.
He reported 2,729 wholesale growers and 5,016 retail sales outlets in New York State, up slightly from last year.
Becker's Farm here is an example of the changes new young farmers can bring. The business is on 82 acres on Routes 9 and 20, a major four-lane highway, surrounded by shopping centers, restaurants, motels, shops and a few residences here in one of a rapidly growing area of Rensselaer County, four miles southeast of Albany. It is operated by David Becker and his wife, Karen, and his father, Frank Becker Jr., and his wife, Cynthia.
It was started as an apple orchard by the David Becker's great-grandfather, but converted into a greenhouse operation by his father.
At the age of 37, David Becker returned to the farm in 1990 with his wife after working for 17 years as a manager of various Agway farm supply stores upstate. "Being self-employed attracted me the most," he said.
The Beckers immediately began to expand and make plans to stay open all year. They converted the old cold-room where apples were once stored into a germination room where plants are grown from seeds under fluorescent lights.
Last year, they sold 7,500 geranium plants; this year they have planted 12,500.
Now, in mid-February, they are growing 50 varieties of house plants in pots, as many varieties of bedding plants for gardens, herbs and vegetable seedlings like tomato, pepper and cucumber. They also plan to sell fruit and vegetables, seeds, fertilizer and other garden supplies.
At this time of year, all the Beckers are busy inside the greenhouses, putting soil in pots, planting seeds, transplanting seedlings, hanging potted plants and labeling the plants in preparation for opening day.
Looking up as she sorted boxes of labels for the plants in one of the greenhouses, Cynthia Becker said, "It's always springtime here."

Analysts Fear That 1992 May Turn Out Like '91

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Despite recent indications of economic revival, signs that have helped to push long-term interest rates to their highest level in nearly three months, many credit market analysts continue to question whether any kind of expansion can be sustained.
Indeed, they say the risks remain great that the economy's performance in 1992 will prove little different from the recession-like pace of activity in the year just past. 
 "There is plenty of reason to think that 1992 could turn out to be a repetition of 1991," said David H. Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International.
 
A Number of Parallels
 As they did a year ago, expectations of an incipient recovery are pushing up interest rates, Mr. Resler said, and money growth, more often than not a good harbinger of economic trends, has been expanding at a very healthy clip.
But the consumer is not in much better shape this year than last, Mr. Resler argued. The size of the labor force continues to contract, and incomes remain under pressure. For those reasons, confidence remains at close to historically low levels.
"We have been here before, most recently last summer," Mr. Resler said, adding that unless long-term interest rates fall fairly significantly from just under 8 percent currently, the odds of 1992 turning out to be little different from 1991 are close to 50-50.
 
Sputtering Housing Market
 Before they began to rise again in mid-January, interest rates, which declined in 1991, especially in the fourth quarter, had provided a modest stimulus to the residential housing market. But developments in the credit markets that have taken place over the last six weeks or so are slowly choking off that demand.
The half-point rise in mortgage rates that has occurred so far this year probably trimmed by 50,000 the number of single-family homes that will be built this year, said Michael Carliner, an economist at the National Association of Home Builders in Washington.
Still, Mr. Carliner said he was not yet willing to change his forecast that slightly less than a million single-family homes would go up this year, an increase from just under 850,000 in 1991. The forecast was made using the assumption that tax-law changes proposed by President Bush to stimulate demand among potential first-time home buyers would not be enacted. The package of tax proposals put together by Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee did not include the tax credit for first-time buyers that Mr. Bush had proposed.
 
Commercial Construction Outlook
 Any upturn in residential housing activity may well be more than offset by a collapse in the commercial construction market, said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at C. J. Lawrence Inc.
"Commercial construction has already crashed in terms of pricing and rents," he said. "This year I think actual construction will crash simply because financing has completely dried up."
Analysts are also concerned that major export markets, which were practically the only source of consistent growth for the economy last year, are on the verge of contracting.
The current situation in Europe and Japan "probably means they won't buy as much from the United States as they did last year," said Alan Sinai, president of Boston Company Economic Advisers Inc. He added, "Exports are a risk."
Joseph G. Carson, chief economist at Dean Witter Financial Services, said he was also concerned that a slowdown in export growth could stifle a recovery.
But Mr. Carson added that there have been major changes in the financial landscape over the last year. He said those changes should be sufficient to get the economy growing again.
The sharp slide in short-term interest rates over the last year has allowed individuals and families to pare debt levels, Mr. Carson said. That, in turn, is allowing household liquidity ratios -- the amount of total liquid assets held compared with outstanding liabilities -- to stabilize and start to improve. And a stronger household balance sheet is needed to support any rise in consumption.
 
Lower Corporate Debt Costs
 For corporations, the decline in interest rates has lowered their debt costs, thereby improving prospects for greater profitability once the economy turns up.
Last, and perhaps most important, Mr. Carson noted that fiscal policy on the Federal level would almost certainly be expansive this year, while it was restrictive in 1991.
Until earlier this month, Mr. Carson had been very pessimistic about the economy's prospects, and he is still forecasting a 1 percent decline in first-quarter output.
But the combination of a modestly stimulative fiscal package and what he sees as much-improved financial flows caused him to raise his projections for growth and interest rates for the remainder of the year.
"For the year ending in the fourth quarter of 1992, we are now forecasting a 1.8 percent advance in real gross domestic product," Mr. Carson wrote in a letter to clients, "one percentage point more than our prior estimates."
The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, who has said repeatedly in recent weeks that the Fed believes it has provided enough monetary stimulus to spark a recovery, will very probably reiterate those views this week during his semiannual testimony to Congress on the economy and money supply.
Mr. Greenspan is just as likely to add in the next breath that the Fed stands ready to lower short-term interest rates further if warranted.
"The Fed's comfort with recent glimmerings of recovery can be no stronger than the evidence," Susan Hering, an economist at Salomon Brothers, wrote in the firm's weekly Comments on Credit. "And such proof remains tenuous."

Hard Times, Continued
The winter freeze is far from over on Seventh Avenue, where many companies have been holding on by their fingertips. Some are slipping off. 
 Mary Ann Restivo, a designer who tied her fate to a large public company, Leslie Fay, was dropped from that company's roster of labels last week. And Rebecca Moses, who has been in and out of business before, broke with her Italian backers.
On Friday, Argenti, a medium-sized Seventh Avenue dress and sportswear house that specialized in silk prints, announced it was filing for protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code, after 12 years in business.
"We had a tremendous amount of debt," said Pat Argenti, the company's chief executive. "That was the real problem. Our interest payments were huge." Sales, which were as high as $100 million in 1989, slumped to about $38 million last year.
"The stores pulled back tremendously," he said, adding that the R. H. Macy bankruptcy was a factor, but not an overriding one.
 
Armani's Expansion
 Giorgio Armani, who is better known for expensive clothes, has ambitious plans for his A/X stores, based on the Army's PX stores. About 80 percent of the items -- from T-shirts and jeans to parkas and cotton dresses -- cost under $100 each.
He plans to open A/X stores all across the country, including within larger retailers, which have been falling all over themselves trying to come up with ways to promote the concept. The Armani label, with worldwide sales of $654 million last year, has a nice ring at the register.
Saks Fifth Avenue, which opens its first A/X boutique on Saturday, will mount a six-story slide presentation on the store's facade, with black-and-white photo images projected from Rockefeller Center. Bloomingdale's, which opens a similar boutique the same day, will feature a dry cleaner's conveyor rack with Armani clothes moving through its Lexington Avenue windows. There will also be an electronic billboard flashing the advertising copy:
Store. Men's. Women's. Clothing. Jeans. Basics. Period.
The words, spit out like an old telegram message, give an idea of what fashion is coming to: utilitarian, economical, splendidly null.
 
From Men's to Women's
 Sabato Russo, a designer known for his spirited men's wear, has decided to jump into the women's clothing business.
Mr. Russo, who recently signed a contract with Hilldun Corporation, a Seventh Avenue financial company, for backing, said he would begin showing women's wear in just a few weeks, for fall 1992.
The women's clothes will be like his men's, he said: tailored and original, with unexpected fabrics.
 
Fashion on Cable
 More fashion on cable TV: VH-1, the music-video network, has hired the model Christie Brinkley to be the host of "VH-1's Top 21 Fashion Countdown." The show will highlight 21 musical performers who have influenced the way people dress.
For instance, to illustrate the influence of ripped jeans and leather jackets, Ms. Brinkley will introduce the video "Freedom" by George Michael. For the little black stretch dress, it will be Robert Palmer's "Addicted to Love," with its mechanized chorus line of live mannequins. The retro look will be shown by Harry Connick Jr.'s "You Didn't Know." And so on.
Ms. Brinkley's performance will be taped on the third floor of Saks Fifth Avenue on Feb. 28, from 2 to 5 P.M. The public is invited. The program will be broadcast on April 3 at 7 P.M.

Tomba Trades in the Flash, but Keeps the Flair

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: VAL D'ISERE, France, Feb. 17

 BODY:
Alberto Tomba hit the Olympics as only La Bomba can.
Arriving here by helicopter Sunday night for Tuesday's giant slalom, the Italian champion promptly announced that he was changing his playboy life style in deference to the pursuit of Olympic gold. 
 "I used to have a wild time with three women until 5 A.M.," he said. "In the Olympic village, I will live it up with five women until 3 A.M."
Tomba, who had been training in Italy for the giant slalom and Saturday's slalom, said he did not consider himself the favorite for either of those races.
"I do not particularly expect medals," he said, not very convincingly.
Later in the interview, he sounded more confident of becoming the first men's Alpine skier to win consecutive gold medals, having won both of these events, his specialties, in the 1988 Games at Calgary. He reminded journalists that Calgary was in the province of Alberta and that the center for these Olympics is in the town of Albertville.
"Maybe after the Games they will have to rename it Alberto-ville," he said.
 
Canadian Judge Summoned
 ALBERTVILLE, France, Feb. 17 (Special to The New York Times) -- By custom, any time the marks awarded by a judge in figure skating suggest a nationalistic bias, the judge is required to explain the marks to the referee and, ultimately, the technical committee of the International Skating Union. An insufficient explanation could lead to a demotion from judging at the international level or even a suspension.
One judge who has been put in that position is Jean Mathews of Canada. Her scores for Kurt Browning of Canada on his free-skating program Saturday night were the highest awarded for both technical merit and artistic presentation. She also marked him as having the second-best program over all, behind Paul Wylie of the United States. She had Viktor Petrenko of Ukraine third.
The final standing was Petrenko, Wylie, Petr Barna of Czechoslovakia, followed by Christopher Bowman in fourth; Aleksei Urmanov of the Unified Team, formerly the Soviet Union, fifth, and Browning.
 
No American Edge
 No one will be able to accuse the United States judge of national bias in the women's singles competition, which begins Wednesday night with the original program.
There is none.
The nine-member panel is selected from a pool of 10 judges, and the United States entry, Margaret Wier of Park City, Utah, was the odd judge out. She will serve as the alternate, instead, awarding scores along with the others but only having them count if someone becomes ill during the competition.
"It's happened," she said. "But it's rare."
The judges working the competition are from Germany, Canada, China, France, Japan, Denmark, Czechoslovakia, Britain and the Unified Team. No one from the United States delegation was complaining, however.
The panel judging the women's competition at the world championships last March in Munich was also without an American judge and the United States swept the medals with Kristi Yamaguchi, Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan.
 
Rewards for Unified Team
 Despite the economic difficulties in the former Soviet Union, sports authorities of the Unified Team decided to reward Olympic medal winners in hard currency, starting with $3,000 for a gold.
While that might seem frivolous, with so many ordinary citizens desperately short of money, Vsevolod Koukoushkine of the Russian Information Agency said he has detected no public outcry over the spending.
"Absolutely not," he said. "People see that the money is not being paid under the table. It is a reward for success, the way the system is supposed to work. They get to see how it's done.
"Besides," he added offhandedly, "the money is coming from adidas."
 
Harding Lands at Last
 Tonya Harding, the third-place finisher behind Kristi Yamaguchi and Nancy Kerrigan at the United States figure skating championships, finally arrived in Albertville on Sunday and practiced for the first time today.
She insisted her late arrival from her home in Portland, Ore., would not deter her mission.
"I don't feel tired," she said. "I've never had jet lag in my life. My practice was as well as I expected for my first practice here."
Harding, the 21-year-old national champion of 1991, said she reached the athletes' village by 4 P.M. on Sunday, went to sleep and did not awake until 8 A.M. today.

HEADLINE: Washington May Change Its Position On Climate

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS

 BODY:
AS delegates from around the world meet at the United Nations today to try to avert the threat of global warming, the Bush Administration finds itself in the hot seat, but there are signs that it may be preparing to wiggle out.
Negotiators from Europe and Japan are expected to continue putting pressure on the United States to agree that all industrialized countries should accept a limit on their emissions of carbon dioxide, the chief heat-trapping gas that scientists fear will bring on a possibly catastrophic warming of the earth's climate. 
 The limit proposed is that by the year 2000 each country should reduce its emissions to 1990 levels.
The United States, the largest producer of carbon dioxide, has long resisted the concept of a limit. Under John H. Sununu, the recently departed White House chief of staff, Washington was committed to a position that the scientific basis for believing in global warming was flawed, that curbing carbon dioxide would restrain economic growth, and that in any case the United States had already taken all necessary actions to stabilize its contribution of world-warming gases by 2000.
Today's climate conference is the fifth negotiating session in a series leading up to the "Earth Summit" in Rio de Janeiro this June. Although one more session is planned, for April, many experts believe a breakthrough must come now if there is to be time to achieve a treaty for signature at the June meeting.
New scientific findings about the role of ozone-destroying CFC chemicals in global warming have undercut one of the Administration's principal arguments, that this nation's sharp cutback on these gases would significantly reduce its contribution to greenhouse warming. The Environmental Protection Agency has dusted off economic analyses, shelved in the days of Mr. Sununu, that indicate the proposed cap might not be so costly to the United States. And all five Democratic Presidential candidates support caps on carbon dioxide emissions.
Under all these pressures, Washington is taking another look at the issue. "It's on the scope now," said an official close to the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Pressure is also being brought on behalf of the Administration's present stance, however, by energy and energy-related industries. Officials familiar with the discussions within the Administration say that the situation is fluid and that no decision on any policy change has yet been made. Nor, they say, will any change materialize when the treaty talks begin today in New York.
The American position paper for the opening of the session, made public on Sunday in a document obtained by Senator Al Gore, Democrat of Tennessee, includes no reference to targets and timetables. Rather, it calls for nations to take "cost-effective measures" to limit emissions of heat-trapping gases "in accordance with their national circumstances, development priorities and capabilities."
It is possible, some officials say, that a change in the United States position could take place before the New York session ends on Feb. 28. Otherwise it would have to surface, if at all, at a sixth session expected at the United Nations in April.
Environmentalists and some Europeans fear that this will not allow enough time to reach a meaningful convention on global warming that could be signed, as planned, at the Earth Summit dealing with a range of global environmental questions in Rio de Janeiro.
"In April it may be too late," said Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, a climate specialist at the Environmental Defense Fund in New York. "We're not leaving enough time to build an intelligent agreement unless the U.S. switches its position during this negotiation."
 
Possible Catastrophic Effects
 If scientists are right, the stakes in the global warming talks are high. Carbon dioxide and other gases emitted as a result of human activity trap heat in the atmosphere much as glass panes trap it in a greenhouse.
Scientists convened by the United Nations to advise the negotiations predict that at present rates of emission, the buildup of greenhouse gases will increase the earth's average surface temperature by 3 to 8 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the next century, with possibly catastrophic effects. These could include a rise in sea level, a shifting of climatic and agricultural zones, more frequent droughts, and severe ecological disruption.
Some dissenting scientists say that the predictions exaggerate the warming, and others say that whatever warming does come could be benign, occurring mostly at night and in the winter. But a panel of the National Academy of Sciences has concluded that the threat, though uncertain in severity and timing, is sufficient to justify a prompt response.
Environmentalists see the United States as essential to a climate convention with any teeth. As the world's biggest economy and largest single emitter of carbon dioxide, they say, the United States must take a leading role -- not only because of its part in whatever greenhouse warming occurs but also as an example for developing countries.
Many developing countries, whose use of fossil fuels is rapidly expanding, have expressed skepticism about the global warming threat. Collectively, they are demanding that the developed countries foot the bill for their conversion to energy sources that produce less greenhouse gas. But many say they are reluctant to make commitments unless the United States makes them as well.
Environmentalists are casting Washington's performance in the climate talks, and at the Rio conference, as a litmus test of the Administration's willingness to take a leadership role on global environmental questions that are moving to prominence with the end of the cold war.
As discussion has opened up within the Administration, environmentalists have been able to follow the action much more closely than when Mr. Sununu controlled the debate. Several of them met last week with Samuel K. Skinner, the current White House chief of staff, to discuss global warming. Although Mr. Skinner reportedly made no commitments and said that industry pressure to avoid caps on carbon dioxide emissions had intensified, the meeting itself would have been inconceivable under Mr. Sununu.
Everything considered, "there will likely be a change" in the Administration's position in the climate negotiations, "but it has not been resolved yet," said another Administration official who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity.
The Environmental Protection Agency's analyses of the economic effects of a carbon dioxide cap, long in preparation against the day when they might be needed, are now being scrutinized in the White House. They indicate that under private forecasts of economic growth for the next decade, carbon dioxide emissions in the United States will grow only slightly or, on a per capita basis, not at all.
 
Hopes for a Treaty
 The analyses indicate that a variety of actions now under way to promote energy efficiency, not taken into account by the economic forecasts, could rein in carbon dioxide enough to make it possible for the United States to sign a treaty that pledges to stabilize carbon dioxide emissions. The actions include, for example, the adoption of more efficient lighting and appliances, incentives for public utilities to promote the more efficient use of electricity rather than build new power plants and the planting of a billion trees, which absorb carbon dioxide.
Advocates of caps on carbon dioxide see them as a first step toward an eventual cut in the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Environmentalists have long promoted energy efficiency as a way to make a start on the control of global warming while reaping savings on energy, reducing air pollution and promoting energy independence.
Until now, the Administration has been arguing that any attempt to limit the emission of greenhouse gases should focus not on carbon dioxide but on the "full basket" of gases. These include methane, nitrous oxides and especially chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC's. The manufacture of CFC's, which are used as refrigerants and propellants in aerosol cans, is being phased out under a previous international agreement because they are destroying the stratospheric ozone shield. The shield protects living things from the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays.
 
Administration's Position
 On the basis of earlier analyses, the Administration has argued that although carbon dioxide emissions will rise somewhat in this country, the reduction in CFC's would stabilize this country's overall contribution to global warming by the end of the decade.
But a more recent scientific finding indicates that the greenhouse warming caused by CFC's is approximately offset by a cooling brought on by ozone depletion, also caused by CFC's. The CFC's, in effect, cancel out their own contribution to global warming. The finding has been cited in a report to be released soon by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the international group of scientists convened by the United Nations to advise the climate negotiations.
"This undercuts the Administration position that it's not so important to concentrate on carbon dioxide," Dr. Oppenheimer said.
The panel also cited recent findings that sulfate aerosols created by the burning of the same fossil fuels that produce carbon dioxide are scattering sunlight and helping clouds to form, thereby cooling the Northern Hemisphere and limiting the warming there in recent decades.
Computerized mathematical models that simulate the workings of the atmosphere say the earth's climate should have warmed by about 2 degrees Fahrenheit in the last 100 years. In fact, it has warmed by about half that amount. Opponents of early action to combat global warming, including those in the Administration, have cited this discrepancy as evidence that the models, which are the main tool in forecasting future warming, are too crude to be believed.
 
Accuracy of Models
 The international panel, however, says the discrepancy could have been accounted for by the cooling effect of the sulfate aerosols. If so, it could mean that the models are more accurate than the critics say. The sulfates, which also cause acid rain, are being eliminated in the United States and Europe. As this is being done, the panel said, aerosol concentrations will rapidly diminish and no longer mask the warming. Carbon dioxide, by contrast, remains in the atmosphere for decades and will continue to warm the earth.
In large measure, the debate about a climate convention has moved beyond the science and is now verging on the purely political. In part, this may be because the Administration, despite the uncertainty of future warming, now accepts the basic science and sees warming as a potential problem.
"The line that science says 'do nothing' has sort of gone by the board," said Rafe Pomerance of the World Resources Institute, a Washington-based environmental organization. "They're not saying it's not a problem. They're just saying 'We don't know what our policy is going to be.' "

HEADLINE: Heavens Open To Astronomers On Low Budgets

BYLINE: By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD

DATELINE: HARD LABOR CREEK, Ga.

 BODY:
IN the tradition of cosmic discovery, the stars are supposed to yield their secrets through finely polished mirrors encased in sleek cylinders, set in domes on lofty mountains, or at big dish antennas out in the desert, tuned to faraway radio whispers. Not through anything as commonplace as mail-order mirrors fixed to a simple metal rack canted toward the sky over the low red hills of Georgia.
This instrument, called the Multi-Telescope Telescope, epitomizes the way the new technologies of electronic sensors, fiber optics and inexpensive computers are giving astronomy some promising low-budget capabilities. It is the product of a new design philosophy that could change the look and practice of much astronomy, enabling ambitious scientists to break into the big leagues of research with investments as little as $80,000. 
 That is what the telescope is costing Georgia State University, about one-fifth the price of a more conventional instrument with similar abilities. Dr. William Bagnuolo, a Georgia State research scientist who is director of the project, called the telescope a triumph of technology over economics, with tight budgets forcing "us to become a little more clever."
Yet, when the telescope goes into operation this spring at Hard Labor Creek -- a name handed down from the days of slavery -- it should put the university in the forefront of an important branch of astronomy exploring the secrets of stellar composition and evolution.
Other astronomers praise the design concept and predict the telescope will lead to exciting new discoveries. Not all research, they point out, requires the huge mirrors and expensive instruments of the multipurpose telescopes at celebrated places like Kitt Peak in Arizona, Mount Palomar in California or Mauna Kea in Hawaii.
In a study of astronomy objectives for the 1990's, a panel of the National Research Council recommended an increased investment in small projects as the best way to respond quickly to new scientific or technological developments and involve more younger astronomers. Federal officials who finance science projects report receiving and approving a growing number of proposals for relatively inexpensive telescopes designed for specific research goals.
The new telescope here, 40 miles east of Georgia State's campus in Atlanta, could serve as a pattern. It is not much to look at, standing alone and unsheltered outside the main observatory buildings, looking more like an engineer's idea of abstract metal sculpture than a conventional telescope. It cannot even produce an image of galactic vistas.
"Our philosophy has been to keep things simple," Dr. Harold A. McAlister, director of Georgia State's Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy. "We did not want a telescope that tries to do all things for all people. That's what drives up the cost. What we have is in keeping with what we needed to do in our special areas of astronomy, and at absolutely minimum expense."
 
Following Path of Amateurs
 Accordingly, the university started by ordering nine small mirrors, the kind usually sold to amateur astronomers, from an advertisement in Sky and Telescope magazine. Each mirror cost $240 and is 13.1 inches in diameter, but operating together they have the light-collecting power equivalent to a single mirror at least 40 inches in diameter. The nine small mirrors weigh only 108 pounds, one-fifth of what a single mirror of similar total diameter would weigh.
The reduced weight saves construction costs. The frame holding the array of nine mirrors could be made in the university machine shop of a lightweight metal alloy. A less expensive motor could be used to move the telescope, altogether a trim 900 pounds.
Another weight-saving approach was to install the instruments for processing the collected light inside a nearby building, not on the telescope frame itself. This became an option because of fiber optics. From each mirror runs a fiber link to carry starlight to the instrument, a spectrograph, where the light is merged to create the effect of a 40-inch mirror telescope.
Prisms and filters in the spectrograph separate and analyze the light to reveal the structure and composition of stellar material. In particular, Georgia State astronomers want to study pulsating stars and binary star systems, where there are two or more stars in orbit about each other.
Dr. McAlister said the first targets would be the more than 250 binary stars the university's astronomers have already identified using telescopes at other observatories in Arizona and Chile. By measuring velocities of the stars as they orbit each other, astronomers expect to determine their masses and other physical characteristics.
With a telescope close to home and devoted full time to this research, the astronomers should be able to examine each stellar target regularly for an indefinite period, watching for any telling change in a star's behavior. They hope eventually to automate control of the telescope's movement and pointing so it can be operated remotely from the Atlanta campus.
Georgia State also has a parochial interest in the telescope's success. Dr. McAlister said it "should prove that the Southeast is not a bad place for doing astronomy." Although observatories in the Southwest deserts and Hawaii have more clear nights, he said, viewing at Hard Labor Creek is just as good at least two-thirds of that time. The Georgia site thus provides better conditions than many other parts of the country.
The new telescope will be the most powerful such instrument in the Southeast. It was financed in part with a $53,000 grant from the National Science Foundation. The Georgia Tech Research Institute in Atlanta also helped by building the telescope's metal base and developing its computer programs.
Other universities in this country and abroad have expressed interest in applying the design for other low-budget telescopes. "It's an idea anyone could adapt without any difficulty," Dr. McAlister said.
Dr. Wayne Van Citters, an astronomer who is director of advanced technologies at the National Science Foundation, said: "We are getting a lot of excellent proposals, and the competition is stiff. We're encouraging this. For some studies, you don't need instruments at the upper end of technological capabilities."
 
Budget for Astronomy
 The foundation's budget includes $8.6 million this year for astronomy instruments for universities and independent institutions, in addition to its larger commitments supporting multipurpose telescopes at the major observatories. Some of the money is also going to upgrading existing telescopes with new electronic detectors and computers.
"You still have to have the big national observatories that serve a wide variety of users," said Dr. David Latham, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. "Others, like Georgia State, are developing a philosophy where you identify areas of specialization and get the instruments that specialize in that. Personally, I'm a strong believer in having rather more specialization."
Dr. Latham's group is one of Georgia State's competitors in spectrographic studies of binary stars. But Dr. McAlister said, "There are plenty of stars to go around."

Diagram: "Light Mirrors, Heavy-Duty Research"
 With an array of nine 13.1-inch mail-order astronomical mirrors, Georgia State University scientists will have the light-collecting power of a single mirror at least 40 inches across. The mirrors' light weight also cuts the cost of the frame and positioning machinery.
 Further reducing costs, each mirror has a fiber-optic link to carry signals to spectrographic equipment in a nearby building, rather than on the frame itself.

HEADLINE: City Shrinks on Garbage Reform

 BODY:
After almost two years of negotiations, the Dinkins administration blinked and granted New York City sanitation workers a raise without insisting on a full day's work for a full day's pay. Instead the city agreed to more productivity negotiations that could take a year or more, and are not guaranteed to succeed.
What a lost opportunity and costly mistake! Mayor David Dinkins keeps saying that unions won't get raises unless they grant productivity savings. Until he demonstrates that, why should the public -- and unions -- believe him? 
 The negotiations provided the perfect opportunity for the city to demonstrate some muscle. Since the new recycling program began in 1989, many sanitation workers have been working partial days while collecting full salaries. They finish collection routes more quickly because recycling reduced the amount of garbage. The city is obliged to pay additional workers to handle recycling.
The city could have insisted that the new contract extend routes so that all workers put in eight hours, rather than as little as four. Instead the contract sets a goal of returning to 1980 productivity levels, but leaves the means to future talks.
The two sides are supposed to come up with a new collection route formula in about a month. If they disagree, either side can go to binding arbitration. The administration did go to arbitration with its police union and the subsequent agreement was fair, so maybe it will show some mettle with the sanitation workers. At least the new contract establishes a procedure for change. But if City Hall had made productivity reform a condition of the new contract, a city struggling with recession would already be saving badly needed money.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Running From the World

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
Can you believe it? Some reporter, not even an American, had the gall to stand up in New Hampshire and ask the candidate a question about foreign affairs.
The fellow wanted assurances that America would continue to have a role in the world. Well, of course, the candidate was ready for a character like that and with pleasure let him have it. 
 "My friend," he said, "this campaign is not about the outside world. It is about the U.S.A."
The candidate happened to be Patrick Buchanan. But it could have been said by his Republican challenger or any of the five Democratic candidates, and it reflected the tone of the New Hampshire campaign. World? What World?
For Mr. Buchanan, that's logical. He is selling America First. He is tough enough and shrewd enough to keep that same phrase used in the 30's and 40's by American isolationists who tried to block the struggle against Hitler -- very special people, like the Rev. Charles Coughlin, the nasty radio propagandist; Charles Lindberg, and the more open hate-peddlers like Gerald L. K. Smith.
America First means America Only. Fine, for Mr. Buchanan.
But what is the excuse for the others for buying the pollsters' line -- the insulting line that Americans, who from the second decade of this century entered into the world with more responsibility, courage, generosity and understanding of national and personal self-interest than any people on earth, have suddenly become stupid and cowardly louts incapable of comprehending that their jobs, health and safety are tied to what happens in the rest of the world?
President Bush does touch on the world once in a while. Trouble is, he routinely claims victory in the Persian Gulf and credit for the defeat of Communism, neither of which is exactly so. He seems embarrassed about his interest in the world. His handlers think the whole thing is too Yaley for the sweaty voters to grasp.
He shouldn't worry. None of the Democrats or Mr. Buchanan seem interested in or capable of taking him on about the subject. They might have to give some real clues about what they would do if they actually ever had to face "foreign" affairs in the White House.
But from the day after election President Whoever will have to deal with such "foreign" matters as:
How to prevent the collapse of Communism from becoming the collapse of hope that might create new dictatorships -- and goodbye peace dividends. Should we fight Saddam Hussein, leave bad enough alone, or craftily arm new dictators to oppose him, so we can fight them some day?
Nuclear proliferation -- anybody got any real plans? Any program for getting the Chinese Communists out of the missiles-to-Mideast trade or stopping their convict labor from undercutting American workers?
Germany, Japan and the logical coming economic alliance between them -- any interest, Mr. Candidate? And how long can we think of Latin America only as the source of drugs, and refugees of the wrong color?
In the last Democratic debate only one "foreign" question was even asked -- a loaded one about whether Mr. Yeltsin or American workers should get $10 billion if they asked at the same time.
Only Jerry Brown got it right -- a country that can afford hundreds of billions to patch up the bank scandals can afford a little help to both Mr. Yeltsin and the American worker. In their summations, all five ignored world affairs.
But the truth is that excluding Mr. Buchanan, six candidates come out of the tradition of their parties, and country, that America is for better or worse now and forever a part of the world, and must deal with that reality every day.
Yet all six have talked, frightened or fooled themselves into believing that in this one election, American voters have become too stupid to understand that "foreign" affairs have cost Americans more lives than all recessions put together and can again turn murderous. Suddenly we also are too stupid to understand the economic bottom line of foreign affairs -- that imports and exports in decent balance are the only hope for the jobs the politicians keep promising.
The candidates run from the world. The one who understands he can run but he can't hide, and turns to say so -- that's the one worth electing.

HEADLINE: In China, as in Its Neighbors, Repression Pays

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Helping Hand, Heavy Foot: Both Are the Real China" (The Week in Review, Jan. 26) puzzles over the paradox of rapid growth amid political repression in China -- China's failure to "fit into a mold." You contrast China with other Communist countries, which "simultaneously repressed and impoverished their citizens." In addition to the Soviet Union, you compare China with Iraq under Saddam Hussein and with India. Almost the only countries you fail to mention are the rapidly growing Confucian societies in East Asia.
To a student of these societies -- Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore -- there is nothing unprecedented about the combination of rapid economic growth and a political mailed fist. On a population-adjusted basis, more lives were sacrificed by far on the altar of political stability in Korea's 1971 Kwangju massacre than 18 years later in Beijing. On Feb. 28, 1974, the Taiwan government, transplanted from the mainland, crushed an uprising at a cost of at least 10,000 deaths; the Taiwan population has since been docile. Political repression in Hong Kong and Singapore has been less bloody, but no less effective. 
 We in the West habitually allow the economic successes of these countries to overshadow the political side. How curious, then, that with China we focus on politics, ignoring the rapid growth. Over the last quarter-century per capita gross national product in China grew at the astonishing rate of nearly 6 percent; the only countries in the world that grew faster were its four neighbors in East Asia.
That growth rate has accelerated sharply since 1980. We are now witnessing the emergence of the fifth East Asian superstar -- as repressive as the first four. Only when we see that all five were shaped in a single mold, will we clearly understand where their growth performance is coming from.

HEADLINE: In China, as in Its Neighbors, Repression Pays;
America Shamed

 BODY:
To the Editor:
President Bush's meeting with China's Prime Minister, Li Peng (front page, Feb. 1), continues to shame America's commitment to the pursuit of freedom around the world. From the Administration's delicate condemnation of the June 1989 massacre in Tiananmen Square, to Brent Scowcroft's subsequent secret visit to China and the renewal of China's most-favored-nation status, President Bush has disgraced America's historical role.
Largely for economic reasons, the United States has continued to engage and legitimize Li Peng's regime under the proposition that repression would be more likely to wane with our involvement than without it. But two years after the crackdown against democracy, Mr. Bush's "constructive engagement" policy is a failure. 
 Repression in Li Peng's China continues since the Tiananmen tragedy. Thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators rot in Chinese prisons, young lives ruined forever. Thousands more, some not even involved in the protests, have been sent to the countryside for "re-education," reminiscent of the Cultural Revolution. Li Peng has directed his regime's repressive apparatus against the growing number of Chinese turning to religion for solace and hope. Students from Beijing University, the intellectual heart of the pro-democracy movement, write of terrible restraints on their education and daily lives. A letter hand-delivered last month from a former student of mine describes the atmosphere in Beijing as "gray, bleak and hopeless."
Executions, detainment, arrest and surveillance are the regime's hallmarks. The Bush Administration and many of America's China experts seem willing to overlook all transgressions of human rights in the interest of cordial relations with the brutal leaders in Beijing.
President Kennedy proclaimed to the world: "We stand for freedom. That is our conviction for ourselves; that is our only commitment to others. No friend, no neutral and no adversary should think otherwise. We are not against any man -- or any nation -- or any system -- except as it is hostile to freedom."
These words ring hollow in the vastness of Tiananmen Square and have lost meaning in Mr. Bush's America.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: New Hampshire;
CANDIDATES TAKE THEIR LAST SHOTS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Feb. 17

 BODY:
The New Hampshire primary contest rolled into its final, frantic hours today with candidates in both parties hanging on the whims, anxieties and passions of perhaps 265,000 voters.
President Bush fought to stave off an embarrassingly strong showing by his conservative challenger, Patrick J. Buchanan. "Don't worry about trying to send some message," Mr. Bush said in an interview from the White House on WMUR-TV in Manchester tonight, reflecting the underlying concern of his campaign about this recession-racked state. 
 On the Democratic side, former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, who is leading in the polls here, tried to swell his support and follow a New Hampshire tradition: galvanizing an underdog's campaign in this first primary state. Dismissing the notion that his support comes largely from his status as a regional favorite, Mr. Tsongas told a rally in Concord, "Feel it, enjoy it, savor it -- and let's go get 'em."
 
Storming the State
 All five of the major Democratic candidates stormed New Hampshire today, hoping to elbow their way far enough up the rankings on Tuesday to give them some credibility in the scramble of primaries and caucuses that follow.
The test is particularly important for Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, with New Hampshire giving the first verdict from the voters on the extent of the damage to his candidacy after three weeks largely dominated by reports about his Vietnam-era draft status and the accusations, published in a supermarket tabloid, that he had a 12-year extramarital affair.
"I think we have survived remarkably, and I think the energy in this campaign is plainly with us," Mr. Clinton said today, when he made a ritualistic stop at Nashua City Hall, where John F. Kennedy stopped in his 1960 campaign. The Clinton campaign, however, was trying to play down expectations for Tuesday, with Mr. Clinton asserting that there was a "world of primaries to go." He clearly hopes to mend his campaign when the race moves to the flurry of primaries, March 3 and March 10, in his native South.
Most of the final New Hampshire polls showed Mr. Tsongas in the lead, followed by Mr. Clinton, with Senators Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Tom Harkin of Iowa neck and neck for third place, and former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California lagging at the back.
Among the wild cards here is the strength of the write-in campaign for Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, who continued to send mixed signals today to volunteers in New Hampshire. He said he regarded every write-in vote as "an embrace and a kiss from a stranger" but predicted that he would not do well because voters might think he was being "cute."
He also said he regretted not being able to run, "particularly now because there is ambiguity."
On this final day in New Hampshire, the undecided voter was king, but a confused king. Peter O'Neill, a 49-year-old program manager for the Raytheon Corporation who talked with Mr. Clinton at a coffee shop in Hudson, said he was torn between Mr. Clinton, Mr. Brown and Mr. Kerrey. "I'm in a dilemma," he said, as his breakfast omelette grew cold.
What the voters of New Hampshire have already done, however, is remind Mr. Bush of the short tether of elective office. The President was back in Washington today after a weekend of campaigning here, but his wife was working the state on his behalf and Mr. Bush himself was wooing New Hampshire Republicans long-distance via drive-time radio shows, television commercials and interviews on the Manchester evening news.
"I've been under fire from newspapers and then watched the news this morning, and apparently every single one of them was attacking me all day, and so was the other guy," Mr. Bush told WFEA radio in Manchester, reflecting a final stretch when he was, indeed, under heavy fire from both parties, and from voters outraged at the depth of the recession here.
"I don't know how to sort it out, but I am content that people in the final analysis will say we're not looking for slogans," the President said. The stakes for Mr. Bush here could hardly be higher: New Hampshire Republicans will essentially decide whether he gets to turn his sights to the general election and the Democrats, or leaves here limping and embarrassed, forced to contend with Mr. Buchanan in states down the road.
 
An Economic Anger
 Mr. Buchanan kept hammering away at the President as a man who abandoned his promises. "It is George Bush himself that's taxing and spending your future away," one of the Buchanan commercials asserted on this final day.
Mr. Buchanan himself spent his 44th day of campaigning in New Hampshire with a 231-mile bus tour that took him to 12 cities, where he thanked his supporters for showing the "courage" to stand up to a President in their own party. With many final polls showing him with the backing of just under 30 percent of New Hampshire Republicans, Mr. Buchanan refused to predict how well he would do, but said he would remain in the race until the Republican convention in Houston in August. As his bus sped between Exeter and Portsmouth, Mr. Buchanan described his campaign as a fight for "the heart and soul of the Republican Party."
In the view of many analysts, however, the real power of Mr. Buchanan's candidacy here comes from economic anger; the Bush campaign felt compelled to run television advertising, in these final days, urging voters to "send Congress a message" to "pass my plan for economic growth."
For the Democrats, Tuesday will be the first sorting-out of a field of five major contenders who entered the race late, stumbled often and left some in their party hungry for other candidates to join the fray.
"One of the dramas out of New Hampshire for the Democrats is whether something happens in the results that entices another Democrat in, sooner rather than later," said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic poll taker who is not committed to any of the candidates. "A good Clinton second-place finish may slow down the momentum for a new entry, or at least make it harder."
Mr. Garin reflects an attitude among many Democrats that Mr. Tsongas has yet to demonstrate that his campaign will travel well. They wonder how much of his appeal is due to his regional roots and 10 months of patient grass-roots politics here, and how much is due to his personal appeal and his message of stern economic truth-telling. Mr. Tsongas took on those critics today, asserting, "The pundits who wrote me off are going to have to explain why." He added, "I'm a regional candidate -- North, South, East and West."
 
'I'm Still Standing'
 Echoing the themes he has sounded throughout this campaign, Mr. Tsongas said the Democratic Party would continue its "fierce embrace" of human, social and enviornmental values, but would also become a pro-business party. "Some Democrats will find this very hard to take," said Mr. Tsongas, who endorses a cut in the tax on capital gains to encourage investment, a position that many fellow Democrats reject. "So be it. Tomorrow it happens."
Mr. Clinton, for his part, told reporters today that after the three weeks he has endured, "I think the greatest success is I'm still standing." The Arkansas Governor, who at one point led in the polls in New Hampshire and seemed on a glide path to the nomination, but has been struggling to steady his candidacy in recent days, said, "When I had more dumped on me in less time in a very organized, calculated way than any other politician in living history, we didn't lose a single living soul that was here fighting for what I believed in."
Mr. Kerrey, for his part, seemed genuinely upbeat today after receiving good reviews in many quarters for his performance in Sunday night's debate. The Nebraska Senator spent his final day of campaigning with the elderly in Concord, college students in Durham, veterans in Nashua and points between. Often faulted for over-emphasizing the health care issue, he said today that voters were beginning to understand that "national health insurance is just a beginning."
"Unless we have the courage to do this," he said, the nation will not muster the political courage to resolve a host of other problems.
Mr. Harkin was also hitting his basic message today, arguing, "Putting America back to work -- creating jobs -- will be the No. 1 priority of the Harkin Administration." Like other candidates, he, too, said he was in the race for the long haul. "We have a national campaign ready to roll right after tomorrow."
And while the announced candidates scrambled around New Hampshire, the rumbles of Cuomo continued, this time from a news conference in Manhattan. Once again he cited New York's budget difficulties as keeping him on the sidelines. He also said that even if he did well in New Hampshire and resolved his budget problems, a Presidential campaign at this point "probably would be academic."
 
What's Next?
"I honestly believe there is no intelligence, no logic, to giving any credibility, any real import to the write-in results in New Hampshire, which will be a tiny infinitesimal proportion of all the votes you have to get in this country. It shouldn't be relevant." He added that he believed that at least one of the current candidates would demonstrate that he was electable by April and would become the party's nominee.
After the voting on Tuesday, the contest for the Democratic nomination spreads out across the country. The Maine caucuses will be held on Sunday, and if Mr. Tsongas wins here, he will be well-positioned to ride to another victory in that neighboring state; he has been organizing there for months, state party officials say.
Then, next Tuesday, comes the South Dakota primary. The two Midwesterners in the race, Mr. Harkin and Mr. Kerrey, are looking for a boost there, but a state party official said that interest in Mr. Tsongas was picking up in recent days as he began his television advertising there.
The next defining battle after New Hampshire, however, is on March 3, when primaries or caucuses will be held in Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, Idaho, Utah and Washington. This is when Mr. Tsongas hopes to show he can win a major victory outside his region, and thus win the credibility and, more importantly, the money, to go the distance. Dennis Kanin, his campaign manager, said Mr. Tsongas would be particularly emphasizing Maryland, Colorado and Washington.
"I think we have to win Maryland," Mr. Kanin said. Mr. Tsongas's political imperatives are reflected in his schedule on the day after New Hampshire's voting: He will fly to Baltimore for a rally and then on to New York City for a series of major fund-raising events.
On March 3, Mr. Clinton will be counting on his strong political support in Georgia, which includes Gov. Zell Miller, to put him over the top there, and prepare the way for the round of Southern primaries and caucuses that follow on March 10, known as Super Tuesday.

DATELINE: NORTHAMPTON, Mass.

 BODY:
Has there been any more unpleasant sound this primary season than the gnashing of New Hampshire teeth?
For weeks, the nation has been forced to listen to New Hampshirites complain about how tough they've got it. Endlessly, we've had to endure their whining about how little the Federal Government has done to get them back up on their feet. Nightly, we've had to watch the candidates grovel before them, each attempting to "out-care" the other. What I haven't heard anyone saying out loud is what some of us non-New Hampshirites are thinking: Enough, already. 
 Listen, New Hampshire, it's tough everywhere. Despite what the President apparently believes, your recession has not been worse than anyone else's. Connecticut has been devastated by cuts in the defense budget. New York is in terrible shape. Texans have been coping with a severe recession that has lasted far longer than yours -- and which they've handled with much more dignity.
Your tears may move the candidates, but they don't do much for the rest of us. We were facing home foreclosures long before Pat Buchanan stood in front of one in New Hampshire last week; and the unemployed were running out of benefits long before Mr. Buchanan had his New Hampshire conversion experience, wherein he suddenly realized that people out of work really could use those extra 13 weeks of benefits. Perhaps some day he'll visit an inner city and have a similar epiphany about the plight of the people who live there.
While you've been complaining about the President not paying enough attention to you, acting like a 4-year-old who wants his mother, the Administration has actually been pouring millions of Federal dollars into the state, attempting to get back into your good graces. There was that Small Business Administration loan program announced in December and the half-billion dollars in Federal highway funds that are coming your way. This is the kind of aid that you folks, with your historic disdain of government, used to sniff at as "pork barrel." Now you seem to accept such aid as your just due.
In fact, that's been the most annoying thing about listening to you these past few weeks: it's your attitude that it's somehow the Government's responsibility to make everything right again. Aren't you embarrassed? What happened to the flinty independence for which you were once so famous? What happened to your old belief that the only good government was no government?
Do you know who you folks sound like? You sound like the Russians, who keep hoping against hope that their President, Boris Yeltsin, will wave his magic wand and fix their decrepit economy. Unlike them, you should know better.
It turns out, of course, that it's a lot easier to disdain government when everybody has a job. I remember in the good old days of the mid-1980's when John Sununu, your then-Governor, used to thumb his nose at the big spenders in Massachusetts, even claiming (preposterously) that New Hampshire's prosperity was the direct result of minimalist government. The more unpalatable truth is that New Hampshire is an economic satellite of the neighbor you most loathe. If President Bush really wanted to help you, he'd propose a plan to revive the computer companies that used to ring Route 128 around Boston. No doubt he will, the week before the Massachusetts primary.
In the meantime, we read stories in the newspaper about how, when someone in your state has their car repossessed, they often lose their job because they no longer have a way to get to work. Bus service in New Hampshire is terrible. We notice that the pain in the state has been exacerbated in no small part because your unemployment benefits are so much lower than in "big-spending" states, like Massachusetts. The programs that might cushion the blow, which other states provide as a matter of course, you prefer to do without, thanks to your low-tax, low-service ethos.
It's your hypocrisy that grates on us, New Hampshire. If you can't abide either a state income tax or a state sales tax, you ought to be prepared to accept the consequences. If you refuse to erect a safety net, you shouldn't be surprised when the landing turns out to be hard. If you really believe that government is a hindrance to freedom, you should be trying to pick yourselves up without asking it to do everything for you.
Oh, one more thing. Ditch the motto. "Live Free or Die"? How about: "We've Got Our Hand Out, Too."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Ill Wind for the President;
A Wave of Discontent in New Hampshire May Be an Omen for Bush in Other States

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEDFORD, N.H., Feb. 18

 BODY:
The Republicans of New Hampshire made their views clear enough today. Nearly half of them felt dissatisfied enough with George Bush's performance, especially his handling of the economy, to vote for a television commentator, Patrick J. Buchanan, in preference to the incumbent President.
The question is: Will Republicans elsewhere feel and do the same? And will Mr. Bush's evident weakness, together with the rather indecisive outcome of the Democratic primary, propel other Democrats into the contest? 
 It was a bad day for the status quo. Not only did Mr. Bush suffer from voters' wrath; the winner among the Democrats, former Senator Paul E. Tsongas, was a man who has been out of office for eight years and ran against politics-as-usual.
Mr. Buchanan had a lot of advantages in New Hampshire that will not be available to him in subsequent contests, including those in Georgia on March 3 and Texas on March 10, which he has described as his next targets. This state has been hit harder than almost any by the recession. Television advertising is cheap here, an advantage to a challenger, and Mr. Buchanan had the exuberant backing of the state's dominant newspaper, The Union Leader in Manchester.
But the political trade winds could carry the dissatisfaction registered here to other states.
 
'Contagious' Anger
 "The anger expressed by our electorate is contagious, and it will travel," said Thomas Rath, a former state attorney general who was one of the President's main advisers here. "New Hampshire provides the context for what comes next. The White House has to figure out some way to change the mood of the country very quickly, or the President will be in serious trouble."
Clearly, Mr. Buchanan was the recipient of many protest votes. According to a survey of voters leaving polling places, about half of the challenger's supporters said they had backed him mainly to "send a message." About half of those who voted for Mr. Buchanan today said that if he were nominated, they would vote for Mr. Bush in November.
Even after Mr. Buchanan's near-triumph today, politicians and political analysts see him less as a threat to Mr. Bush's renomination, which most of them take for granted, and more as a threat to Mr. Bush's eventual re-election. The longer he stays in the race, they say, the more he distracts the President from the main business at hand, fighting the Democrats.
But then Mr. Buchanan has been underestimated before, notably by the White House political operatives. The candidate's sister, Angela, who heads his campaign, says she is confident that $2 million can be raised in a matter of days to finance the next phase of his effort.
Tonight, Mr. Buchanan appealed for tens of thousands of volunteers in Maryland, Florida and South Carolina, indicating that he planned to run in the primaries there next month as well as those in Georgia and Texas.
Mr. Bush's backers sought to dismiss the New Hampshire results as an aberration. For example, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, a conservative Republican, said, "The President is going to win every primary, and his margin is going to get larger as we go along." Mr. Buchanan, he asserted, would achieve nothing in Texas because he lacked the time and the money to assemble a campaign there.
 
Not a 'Tidal Wave'
 "What this was not is a tidal wave of support for Pat Buchanan as the next President of the United States," said Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., who was a White House political director during the Reagan Administration.
What it was was "a primal scream," said Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, a sometime ally of Mr. Buchanan who is backing the President this time. But the breadth of support for Mr. Buchanan was remarkable, apparently coming close to the 41.9 percent that Senator Eugene J. McCarthy polled against Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968; it was that embarrassment that forced Mr. Johnson from the race.
To be sure, the economic issue of 1992 is less corrosive than Vietnam was in 1968. But Kevin Phillips, a conservative analyst, described Mr. Buchanan's challenge to Mr. Bush as the most serious to an elected Republican president since 1912, when Theodore Roosevelt broke with the incumbent, William Howard Taft, to challenge him under the Bull Moose party banner.
A fierce debate over tactics is likely before the Georgia primary, in which Mr. Gingrich expects Mr. Buchanan to poll at least 30 percent of the total. Speaking for many others, Mr. Rath argued, "You can't let Buchanan get away, as he did here, without facing the scrutiny and criticism real candidates face."
Deciding what approach to take next will be a big test for Mr. Bush's campaign organization, led by Robert M. Teeter and Richard N. Bond. Its performance here looked like that of a team forced into a big game in the midst of spring training -- reflexes slow, too many strikeouts in the clutch. Their inept performance is an embarrassment, but they still have plenty of time to recover for the playoffs.
Almost universally, Republican leaders expect the White House to move rapidly now to emphasize middle-class tax relief. Mr. Bush's ambiguous performance on that issue gave Mr. Buchanan a huge opening here and put the President on the defensive during his final campaign swing.
"The President has to get his message clear, and he has to get out and convince people that he wants to be re- elected, not because of what he has done but what he wants to do," said Edward Rollins, a prominent Republican strategist who also served in the White House under President Reagan.
Mr. Bush's bloody nose may encourage new Democratic candidacies. Even among Republican voters here, only 48 percent approved of his performance as President, with 49 percent disapproving. But the Democratic results, with Mr. Tsongas winning and Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas running a respectable second, send no clear message.
While Mr. Clinton did less well than he had hoped before his campaign was swamped for a time by accusations of marital infidelity and draft evasion, which he denied, he did well enough to head toward the South, his natural base, with his head high. He did equally well among men and women here, and only 5 percent of the Democratic voters said that questions about Mr. Clinton's character influenced the way they voted, according to the survey of voters.
The Arkansan now faces a stern test. He must demonstrate in the next month in the culturally and politically conservative South that the accusations don't cut there, either. If he can, restive national Democratic leaders, many of whom continue to view Mr. Clinton as a damaged political property, may change their minds.
Mr. Tsongas won about a third of the vote, according to the survey of voters. It was a remarkable achievement for a man whose announcement of candidacy was greeted with derision. But he comes from neighboring Massachusetts, so the professionals discounted it, to some degree, as a regional phenomenon.
It will take a few weeks, probably until Maryland votes on March 3 and possibly until Super Tuesday, March 10, when 11 states vote, to answer the question of whether Mr. Tsongas's political magic can be exported.
During that time, in the primaries in South Dakota and elsewhere, the second tier of Democratic candidates -- former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California, who did much better than expected, and Senators Tom Harkin of Iowa and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska -- will vie to see which of them survives. Their blanket finish here meant that New Hampshire's traditional winnowing function was frustrated.
Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri or Senator Al Gore of Tennessee may decide in the next few days to make a late entry. Frank Watkins, an aide to Jesse Jackson, the civil rights leader, called reporters today to suggest that his man was "under pressure to run." It is even possible that Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York might jump in, though the write-in campaign in his behalf did not really catch fire.
With so many questions still open, however, a late entrant might well be seen as a spoiler or worse, and it seems more likely that everyone will wait to see whether any of the active contenders demonstrates staying power.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: White House;
Stunned by Voting, Bush Plans to Travel To Boost Campaign

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 18

 BODY:
Stunned by the voting in New Hampshire, the Bush campaign decided today to keep President Bush on the road virtually every day for the next three weeks and groped for a way to shake the paralysis that was evident in the nation's first primary campaign.
As Mr. Bush acknowledged in a written statement issued late tonight that the voting had been "far closer" than expected, White House and campaign aides reviewed their decision to avoid attacks on Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative challenger, as well as an advertising strategy that many Republican strategists said had produced a series of uninspired commercials in New Hampshire. 
 There was general agreement among Republican strategists that Mr. Bush also made a tactical error when he did not include a $500 increase in the income tax exemption for children among the economic items he said needed urgent action in Congress. Mr. Buchanan's attacks on the issue cost the President votes, Bush aides said.
 
No Mention of Buchanan
 The President, who has avoided uttering Mr. Buchanan's name, did not even give a nod to his campaign in the written statement, saying instead that "opponents on both sides reaped the harvest of discontent with the pace of New Hampshire's economy."
He tried once again to get across the note of compassion that seemed to fall so flat in New Hampshire, despite a last-minute flurry of appearances in the final days before the voting. "I understand the message of dissatisfaction," Mr. Bush said.
The President also continued his tactic of suggesting that he was working to overcome the recession, only to be stymied by the Democrats in Congress.
"My most immediate task has been to get Congress to enact some very sensible, sound proposals that will help get this nation's economy moving forward," Mr. Bush said.
"The message of tonight is that Americans are concerned about the future. I have the right answers and I will take my case to the voters in the next eight and a half months."
The first primary contest seemed to underscore the difficulty Mr. Bush's team has had recovering from a late start, but officials said a consensus had yet to emerge about how to shift directions.
One thing that was immediately apparent was a decision that Mr. Bush could no longer afford to remain in the White House and hope to coast through the rest of the primaries.
The Bush campaign completed plans to send the President to all 11 states, most of them in the South, that will hold nominating contests on March 10, which is called Super Tuesday.
 
Reeling All Day
 While Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, and other officials tried to put the best face on Mr. Bush's showing, the White House had clearly been reeling all day from from the results of surveys of voters leaving polling places. At midday the campaign's own polls showed Mr. Bush and Mr. Buchanan in a dead heat, with 48 percent of the votes each.
After an early morning strategy session at the White House, Robert M. Teeter, the campaign chairman, who was described as "very, very worried," shuttled between there and his nearby headquarters for consultations.
In New Hampshire, the Bush campaign stepped up its effort to increase the voter turnout, using telephone banks capable of generating as many as 5,000 calls per hour. The callers focused on voters who were identified as being uncommitted but leaning toward Mr. Bush, urged them to vote and offered rides to the polls.
In addition, Gov. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, the campaign's state chairman, Senator Warren B. Rudman and John H. Sununu, the former White House chief of staff, also worked through the day on the telephone and gave interviews to local reporters. These efforts may have helped widen Mr. Bush's lead over Mr. Buchanan in later voting.
While the Bush team laid plans to take the campaign to the next battlefield in the South, the White House pressed ahead with a plan to send Mr. Bush off to Knoxville, Tenn., on Wednesday morning to talk about high technology and education. A trip to South Carolina was also planned for Friday.
Officials said that W. Henson Moore, the deputy chief of staff who arranged the trip, argued that Mr. Bush could mitigate the political fallout by wrapping himself in the trappings of his office. Samuel K. Skinner, the chief of staff, overruled other officials who said that Mr. Bush should be responding to the New Hampshire results and that he could do that better from the White House.
The Bush team sent spokesmen to New Hampshire, including Charles Black, the campaign's senior adviser, and arranged a series of appearances on Wednesday morning's talk shows. But Bush aides acknowledged that the best they could hope to do was to make a case that his showing was not as bad as it might seem and that Mr. Bush would win the nomination in the end.
"Maybe New Hampshire will shatter that sense of complacency," a senior Republican strategist said tonight.
 
Leaving Bush on Defensive
 The strategist added: "Things have got so bad that some people are saying the best thing that could happen now is the emergence of a strong Democrat. That might stun the party into thinking we could lose the White House and force us to get our act together."
While Mr. Buchanan still does not seem a real threat to Mr. Bush's nomination, Republican strategists said the New Hampshire results left Mr. Bush looking weakened, kept him on the defensive and provided no popular support for the economic program he is trying to push through Congress.
Bush aides said that there was a strong sense in the campaign and in the White House that the President's efforts to promote his economic recovery plan had not succeeded and that the Administration and the campaign needed to find a new message before March 20. That is the deadline Mr. Bush set for passage of the seven measures he considered most urgent.
But officials and party strategists said the campaign's ability to react to the shifting political ground was hampered by the fact that important decisions, like the decision not to push for the new tax exemption for children before the deadline, were still being made not by the campaign, but by Richard G. Darman, the budget director, on bookkeeping grounds.
With the Bush camp still divided over basic tactical and longer-range issues, advisers to the campaign tonight looked for external explanations for their problems.
One said, "Without a doubt, Buchanan's got supporters who are fired, and they're angry. This was always going to be one of the toughest possible states for George Bush, given the state of the economy, and how much time and money Buchanan has spent there. Combine that with the fact that not only he, but every one of the Democrats has been spending their time beating on George Bush."

HEADLINE: Fed Lets Banks Lower Reserves To Aid Lending

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 18

 BODY:
In an unusual move aimed at increasing bank lending to spur the economy, the Federal Reserve announced today that it was cutting the amount of money that banks must hold in reserve to offset possible losses.
The central bank said the action, effective April 2, would enable banks to take $8 billion in reserves not earning income as they sit in bank vaults and use them for investing or lending. Economists, however, said the short-term effect would be modest because banks might wait to strengthen their finances further before they lend.
 
Sending a Message
 Today's announcement came after persistent pleas to the Federal Reserve from the White House and many members of Congress, who, with their eyes on Election Day as well as the economy, have been urging that monetary policy be eased still further. 
 "The Fed is trying to send a message to banks, credit unions and savings and loans; it's trying to say it wants to encourage banks to make more credit available," said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist for the PNC Financial Corporation, a bank holding company in Pittsburgh.
Under the new requirement, banks will be able to reduce the amount of reserves they must hold to 10 percent of deposits in checking accounts, NOW accounts and other transaction accounts, from 12 percent.
"Over time," the Fed said in its announcement, "it is expected that most of these cost savings will be passed on to depositors and borrowers" because lower reserve requirements would reduce the funding costs for banks.
The Fed said its decision "should strengthen the financial condition of banks and thereby improve their access to capital markets, putting them in a better position to extend credit."
Economists said that today's announcement, made on the day before the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, is to report to Congress on the economy, was a modest type of monetary easing that sought to prevent raising fears about inflationary ripples the way a new cut in key interest rates might have.
"This is sort of an insurance policy that the Fed is taking out in terms of insuring that the economy continues to recover, but it's a very modest step," said Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist for the Chemical Banking Corporation.
 
Stocks and Bonds Fall
 The bond market reacted with just such inflation fears, however, and bond prices fell sharply and interest rates rose after the Fed announcement. Partly in reaction to the decline in bonds, stocks then fell, and the Dow Jones industrial average lost 21.24 points to close at 3,224.73.
Some traders also said bond prices fell because many investors interpreted the Fed's move as meaning the central bank would not cut interest rates further.
David M. Jones, chief economist for Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a New York brokerage, said the bond market fell because traders viewed the announcement -- on the day of the New Hampshire primary, and the day before Mr. Greenspan testifies -- as "partly political." Investors worry that when the Fed is being "political," it is concerned more about spurring growth to please politicians and less about fighting inflation.
The Fed said today's move was the first major change in the reserve ratio on checking accounts since Congress enacted the Monetary Control Act of 1980 to require all deposit-taking institutions, not just commercial banks, to meet the Fed's reserve requirements. In December 1990, the Federal Reserve reduced to 0 percent from 3 percent the reserve requirements for certificates of deposit and other time deposits held by corporations, plus Eurocurrency liabilities, which are dollar-denominated certificates of deposit purchased abroad.
 
Had Little Effect
 That move, which was intended to help ease the tight lending situation, allowed banks to invest or lend $13.6 billion in reserves. Economists said that decision ultimately had little effect on increasing lending because banks were so shell-shocked by loans that turned bad, largely because of the downturn in real estate.
The Federal Reserve said the effective date of today's announcement would not be until April to give banks "time to adjust their reserve management strategies" by, for example, "economizing on vault cash."
'It will have a minimal impact within the two to three months after April, but it will have a stronger impact over the next 6 to 12 months," said Mr. Jones, the economist.
Reserve requirements were begun in the early days of the nation when the Federal Government began chartering banks and wanted to make sure banks had a sufficient cushion to protect against a run or other short-term liquidity problem. The reserves are usually held in a bank's own vault or at a regional Federal Reserve bank.
 
System Termed Outdated
 Many economists say the reserve requirement system is outdated because if a bank runs out of cash on a particular day, it can easily borrow from other banks. Economists suggest that the reserve requirement system remains in effect to help maintain consumer confidence in banks and to give the Fed another tool to affect monetary policy.
Normally when the Federal Reserve wants banks to lend more to accelerate economic growth, it reduces the discount rate, the rate at which it lends money to banks, or the federal funds rate, the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans. The Fed has cut rates more than a dozen times over the last 18 months, and even so, many consumers and Government officials complain that banks remain tight-fisted.
The Fed can also seek to improve growth through its open market activities, that is, by buying Government securities from banks and thereby making more money available for lending.
Economists said it would be difficult to estimate whether today's move would have as great an effect on spurring the economy as even a small cut in the discount rate.
 Today's move would not weaken the ability of the nation's banks to absorb losses, analysts said, because banks would still have to maintain a certain capital ratio -- although not necessarily as non-earning reserves -- to protect against losses.

HEADLINE: U.S. AND RUSSIA SEE NEW ARMS ACCORDS FOR A JULY SUMMIT

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Feb. 18

 BODY:
The United States and Russia agreed today to try to complete an ambitious set of new arms control accords in time for a July summit meeting, including establishment of a joint ballistic missile early-warning center, possible sharing of "Star Wars" technology and deep cuts in long-range nuclear missiles.
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and the Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei Kozyrev, said after talks today that to get the agreements ready for signing by President Bush and President Boris N. Yeltsin in July they would bypass the traditional arms control negotiating process, in which dozens of mid-level experts bargain for years in Geneva. They said that instead they would try to tie up the understandings themselves in a series of high-level negotiating sessions, beginning March 10 in Brussels.
 
No More Haggling
 "Hopefully we are beyond the point of having to sit down with huge numbers on each side and spend endless months and years haggling about the tiniest little detail," Mr. Baker said. "We are both committed to trying to pursue this new path." 
 Most of the arms control agreements that Mr. Baker and Mr. Kozyrev pledged to try to forge today have been widely discussed by the two sides since September. The one new element today was the idea of establishing a ballistic missile early-warning center, which the two ministers said would constitute the first concrete defense cooperation between the United States and Russia.
Mr. Baker explained that the proposed arrangement would bring together the United States and its allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, as well as Russia and other former Soviet republics.
 
A Single Location
 American officials said the proposed center would probably tie together all NATO and Russian radar, satellite and other early warning assets in a single location, which is yet to be decided, where all participants could monitor virtually any ballistic missile launching worldwide.
The American officials said the Russians were increasingly interested in such a center because they may no longer be able to deploy certain early warning systems in some outlying former Soviet republics, particularly along the border with Iran, Afghanistan and western China.
"We hope that our NATO allies would want to participate in such an early warning center and we have no reason for our part to exclude participation of any other countries which would want to participate in a responsible way," Mr. Baker said.
United States officials said it was still too early to determine whether the establishment of such a center would require some ammendments to the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty, which restricted antimissile defense systems so that neither superpower would feel so impregnable that it could launch a first strike.
Mr. Baker and Mr. Kozyrev said that whatever understandings they reach on reducing long-range nuclear missiles, or on sharing technology for a space-based missile defense ideally would not need to be enshrined in formal treaties signed by Presidents Bush and Yeltsin. Rather the accords could be codified in a simpler combination of unilateral declarations and exchanges of letters, they said.
 
Exchange of Letters
 Mr. Baker said that, subject to the assent of Congress, "I would personally hope that if an agreement could be reached it could be accomplished in a much more simiplified way, perhaps through an exchange of letters or very short documents."
Mr. Kozyrev said that some economic agreements between the two countries might also be signed at the summit, but he did not elaborate.
But Mr. Baker and Mr. Kozyrev also made clear after their two and half hours of talks that they still have a long way to go before they complete any new agreements. They indicated that they had failed in their first attempt to bridge the gap between proposals by President Bush and President Yeltsin for reducing long-range nuclear weapons well beyond the levels agreed to last summer in the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, known as Start.
Mr. Kozyrev said the American side was still sticking by its proposal that the two sides go down to roughly 4,500 warheads, and the Russians were holding to their demand to reduce to 2,500 warheads each. The arms reduction treaty calls for both sides to reduce only to about 9,000 each.
 
Differences Are Technical
 Mr. Kozyrev argued that the differences between the two sides were not rooted in hard and fast ideological positions but rather "technical problems for which we will find solutions."
That understates the issue, however, since the United States does not want to go below the 4,500 level, because even getting to that plateau will take the Russians until the year 2,000, given their limited capability for dismantling and destroying nuclear weapons.
The Bush Administration also refuses to go down to 2,500 because it would require a major restructuring of its nuclear triad -- long-range bombers, submarines and missiles. Under such reductions, so many missiles would have to be pulled off submarines to get down to 2,500 warheads that it would be prohibitively costly to operate them as nuclear weapons platforms, some officials argue.
The only progress that American officials would cite in this area today was that the Russians agreed to look more closely at the rationale behind the American numbers. But as happened with the arms reduction treaty, the Russians might be persuaded to come closer to the American numbers with offers of more economic aid.
Mr. Baker also politely but clearly dismissed President Yeltsin's proposal that the two nations stop targeting their nuclear weapons against one another. Mr. Baker suggested that while the United States certainly welcomed the spirit of the Russian proposal, it was meaningless since nuclear missiles can be easily retargeted by computer, and therefore it is impossible to make permanent or to verify.
"We supported the spirit of the proposals," Mr. Baker said. "But President Yeltsin himself pointed out that de-targeting is reversible in a very, very short period of time. We discussed the fact that the issue represents some practical problems because of that and because there is essentially no way to verify the question of targeting."
As for sharing the so-called "Star Wars" missile defenese technology, Mr. Baker said the two sides agreed to "talk about the possiblity."
It was too early to tell whether the Bush Administration was really serious about this idea, although some of the leaders of the American antimissile research program have recently expressed an interest in purchasing critical Star Wars technologies from their Russian counterparts, particularly Russian prototypes of a nuclear power system that would orbit in space.
Shortly before departing for Washington after nine days in the former Soviet Union, Mr. Baker met privately today with the Acting Prime Minister of Georgia, Tengiz Sigua, but said this did not mean the United States recognized the provisional government that ousted the republic's elected president, Zviad Gamsakhurdia.
Mr. Gamsakhurdia, who was elected President last May, was forced out in an armed rebellion last month amid charges he was establishing a dictatorship. Local news agencies said that Mr. Gamsakhurdia, who fled six weeks ago, appeared today in Chechen-Ingush, an autonomous region in the Caucasus that backed his government.

Ties With Moldova
WASHINGTON, Feb. 18 (Reuters) -- The United States and Moldova have established diplomatic relations, the President of the newly-independent former Soviet republic said today after meeting President Bush.
"I inform you, ladies and gentlemen, that President Bush made a statement that diplomatic relations between our two countries were established," President Mircea Snegur told reporters after his talks with Mr. Bush. Mr. Snegur, who was elected President of Moldova in December, is on his first official visit to the United States.

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Plan For Small Businesses

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 18

 BODY:
Promoting the economic agenda of the White House, Richard C. Breeden, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, proposed measures today to make it cheaper for small companies to raise money.
The proposals would reduce, and in some cases eliminate, the public disclosure requirements for small companies that issue stock. They would also make it easier for mutual funds to invest in small and new businesses. 
 Mr. Breeden said the measures were an effort to put into practice the White House's recent call to "curtail unnecessary regulatory costs." He said the changes would also assist small companies in obtaining financing just as they are having difficulty getting loans from banks hesitatnt to make new loans because of the slumping economy.
While the details of the proposals will take several months for the commission to iron out, some state regulators have expressed concern that the measures could make it more difficult for shareholders and the authorities to combat fraud in the penny-stock market.
 
'A Delicate Balancing Act
 "The devil will be in the details," said Lewis W. Brothers, the director of Virginia's securities division and the president of the North American Securities Administrators Association, an industry group based in Washington. "It really is a delicate balancing act between investor protection and capital formation."
Some S.E.C. officials have also raised concerns privately about the effect of such changes on the Government's effort to prosecute fraud in the penny-stock market. But Mr. Breeden discounted the concerns today, insisting that the proposals will ease what he called a credit crunch without inhibiting fraud cases.
"While any system must continue to provide a high quality of disclosure and vigorous anti-fraud efforts, there are many aspects of the current system that may add to the difficulty of raising capital without necessarily contributing to good disclosure," Mr. Breeden said in a speech in Washington before the National Press Club, where he disclosed the proposals. "The steps that I have outlined today represent in some cases a significant new approach to the registration procedures in use today.
"For the long run, we should seek to maintain investor protection and the quality of disclosure, while cutting costs, reducing barriers and improving flexibility."
Agency officials said the changes would probably not take effect for at least six months, following a comment period and several hearings.
These were the main proposals:
*Increase to $1 million the amount that can be raised through stock offerings without registering with Federal or state authorities for "seed money" to start a new company. Existing law permits new companies to raise $500,000 without registering, plus another $500,000 that must be registered with state regulators; further offerings require registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
*Increase to $5 million, from $1.5 million, the amount that can be raised in limited public offerings that are offered mainly to big investors and require less disclosure than regular offerings.
*Allow small companies, generally those considered to be worth $20 million to $25 million, to file less detailed quarterly and annual financial disclosures with the commission.
*Make it easier through various changes for mutual funds to invest more money in smaller companies, and loosen the rule that requires mutual funds to offer daily stock redemptions.
Today's announcement was the second in five days by Mr. Breeden on changing the rules of corporate disclosure.
Last Thursday, he announced a proposal that would require publicly traded companies to provide more accurate and detailed information to shareholders about how much is paid to executives and directors.
The commission also ordered companies to give stockholders the right to take pay issues to a vote, although such ballots would not be binding. But they are expected to provide a powerful incentive to corporate managers to reconsider their pay policies.

HEADLINE: U.S. Weighs New Limits on Asylum

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 18

 BODY:
The Bush Administration is considering a plan to curtail sharply the rights of foreigners to seek asylum in the United States.
In a draft document now circulating in the Justice Department, the Administration is proposing to introduce the concept of "summary exclusion," which would give immigration authorities the power to forbid entry to foreigners with fraudulent documents. The plan, an amendment to the immigration law that would need Congressional approval, would also allow authorities to deport immediately any applicant for asylum who is declared ineligible. 
 No review or appeal would be allowed in such cases.
The Administration's draft includes proposals similar to those introduced by the Reagan Administration in the 1980's. None ever became law.
 
Political Motive Suggested
 In Congress today, staff members said there was no indication that the new amendments would be introduced immediately. Several members of Congress suggested that the legislation may be politically motivated in an election year. The Administration would appear to be strictly limiting illegal immigration and extensive asylum during a recession when jobs are already scarce for Americans.
Lawyers representing refugee groups argue that the amendment would be unconstitutional because it would deny people the right to due process. These refugee advocates also say that such a law would be incompatible with international humanitarian standards.
Under present practice, thousands of foreigners who enter the United States with suspect documents -- or no documents at all -- or with what are considered insufficient grounds for asylum claims, are nevertheless allowed hearings and often repeated appeals.
 
Difference in Status
 To gain asylum, a foreigner must be on American soil. To apply for refugee status, which is governed by other procedures and laws, a person must be outside the United States. An asylum seeker can be ordered deported if the claim fails, even under present laws, though the applicant now has the right of appeal. A refugee arrives in the United States with legal status and does not have to clear further hurdles.
About 177,000 asylum cases are pending in the United States.
The amendment to the Immigration and Nationality Act would deal with two immediate problems, according to the Administration's draft document. The first provision, denying entry to foreigners with fraudulent documents or no documents at all, "is designed to deal with the increasingly common practice of presenting fraudulent documents to common carriers and then destroying or discarding them prior to immigration inspection."
The second part of the proposed amendment, allowing for the immediate deportation or repatriation of asylum seekers who do not qualify, the draft says, would "alleviate the present situation in which aliens encountered on the high seas must either be given pre-asylum interviews and processing aboard vessels or on foreign soil, or brought to the United States and effectively allowed to remain indefinitely."
The first provision would address directly the several dozen foreigners in custody at Kennedy Airport in New York or other ports of entry.
 
Blocking Haitians From U.S.
 The second provision is intended to plug the route through which many Haitians hope to enter the United States to make applications for permanent asylum.
Exceptions to summary deportation would continue to be made for people with a credible fear of persecution, according to the draft, which also accepts that some foreigners will arrive with false documents because they were necessary to leave a dangerous situation safely.
Warren R. Leiden, executive director of the American Immigrations Lawyers Association, said in an interview today that the Administration's proposals may sound good in concept but will run into problems "in the practical world."
Mr. Leiden said the Administration seems to be restating current law but making it more extreme, and questions why so much effort is being put into seeking news legislation when current laws could do the same job.
At the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights. Arthur C. Helton, director of the refugee program, said that when asylum rules were last adjusted in 1990, there was an understanding between the Government and independent organizations representing foreigners that new centers would be set up around the country to handle asylum cases expeditiously.
These centers are not functioning as promised, he said, and "deficiencies still keep the asylum system from being capable of dealing with cases in any meaningful way."
The new amendment, he said, would contradict the agreement and in a sense acknowledge that the system was not working.

Tuna and Trade: Whose Rules?

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
SHOULD the European Community have the right to bar meat from America because it contains traces of hormones that it finds scary, but Washington says are harmless to human health?
A blatant protectionist trick, you say? Well, America stops imports of tuna from Mexico because Mexican tuna fishing nets accidentally drown more dolphins in the eastern Pacific than are permitted under American law. If Americans get to decide how Mexicans should catch tuna, perhaps Europeans have the right to decide how their meat is treated while still on the hoof. 
 Or try this one on for size. Almost everywhere in the third world, industry keeps costs down by spewing nasty chemicals into the air and water. Should the products have open access to American markets, where competing domestic businesses are obliged to spend tens of billions annually to keep pollutants out of harm's way?
A new report from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the Geneva-based organization that referees trade disputes for much of the world, offers some clear advice on how to answer these murky questions. But more important, perhaps, the report is a pragmatic plea for tolerance. Erring on the side of open trade, suggests its principal author, Jagdish Bhagwati of Columbia University, is more likely to serve the environmental interests writ large.
GATT does not have specific environmental rules. But it does codify some principles useful in mulling the member nations' treaty obligations.
At the heart of the legal matter is nondiscrimination. Any policy that applies equally to domestic and foreign businesses is fine; otherwise not. Thus when Thailand tried to bar imported tobacco products, a GATT panel said that banning all cigarettes would be fine -- but not just those with the smooth taste and chic foreign labels. When Canada stopped salmon exports on the ground that the species was overfished, GATT asked why Canada did not also limit domestic consumption.
And then there is the slippery matter of the Pacific dolphins. United States laws intended to limit the slaughter of marine mammals do indeed apply to American fishing boats as well as foreign fleets. But in January a GATT panel ruled that America could not use the trade lever to alter practices that had no direct effect on America's environment.
If America, which buys most of Mexico's tuna, could set Mexico's dolphin policy, the panel suggested, any major importing country could bend any dependent exporter to its environmental will. For example, nothing could stop France from barring imports of sewer pipe from Poland because the air in Polish steel mills rots the bronchia of Polish steelworkers.
But the Bhagwati report points out that the GATT treaty certainly does permit countries to agree on common standards for protecting dolphins in international waters, and to enforce the agreements with trade sanctions. Indeed, the GATT diplomats plainly believe the dolphin-tuna imbroglio is the trade issue from hell -- one almost guaranteed to advance the cause of those who care more about raising the price of chunk light than making the Pacific safe for Flipper.
More generally, the report argues that environmentalists have a stake in freer trade. Open borders, for example, would encourage more efficient use of potentially damaging chemicals. European farmers use 10 times as much fertilizer and pesticides to grow a bushel of wheat as their Argentine and Australian counterparts. But thanks to subsidies and trade barriers, Europe still grows its own grain.
Freer trade, the report also asserts, would serve the environmentalists' cause by speeding economic growth. That is not an intuitive notion: Compare the tidy, if bitterly impoverished, small-town life of pre-industrial England with the Dickensian filth of Victorian Manchester. But it makes sense when one thinks of a clean environment as a luxury that the rich can best afford. And a landmark study by Gene Grossman and Alan Kreuger offers some hard evidence to support the case.
The two Princeton economists used World Health Organization data to compare levels of sulfur dioxide in urban air across a range of countries. Moderately poor cities were more polluted than the very poor places that consume little electricity and have yet to replace donkey power with the internal combustion engine. But city air seems to turn the corner at an income of about $5,000 per person -- a level, presumably, at which people who can afford to trap emissions or switch to cleaner fuels. Stockholm is far less polluted than Seoul, but perhaps not for long.
Jagdish Bhagwati and most economists buy such arguments. But to judge by the budding alliance between protectionists and environmental groups, it is not an easy sell. And unfortunately, much hangs in the balance.

HEADLINE: Pitching a Defunct A-Plant: Shoreham Nuclear Power Station

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SHOREHAM, L.I., Feb. 18

 BODY:
To hear the sellers talk, it is a creampuff: one owner, well maintained, exceptionally low mileage. Terms negotiable.
But the representatives of a dozen major companies in the energy business who came out today to kick the tires on the Shoreham Nuclear Power Station and consider bids on converting it to natural gas were not too quick to bite. 
 "All the plants look alike," admitted Walt Peseckas, a project development manager at Bechtel, which used to build nuclear reactors, as he toured the plant that cost more than $5.5 billion but is already partly disassembled. "Sometimes they have a little different color scheme, or a drip here, a drip there," he said.
Mr. Peseckas was one of about 40 executives on the tour led by the Long Island Power Authority, a state agency that is looking for a post-nuclear use for Shoreham since it closed because of public opposition. Conversion to gas poses no technical obstacles, experts say, but Mr. Peseckas pointed to another problem.
"Each state and region has its own economic factors that are driving it," he said. "The question is if it is economically feasible compared to other options." Those include buying hydroelectric power from Quebec or building smaller gas-fired plants when and where they are needed.
 
Life After Reactor
 The Long Island Power Authority has a more perplexing problem. Under the terms of an agreement worked out by New York State and the Long Island Lighting Company, which built Shoreham, the authority will soon acquire the plant for $1. To the victor go the spoils, but what does the authority, composed largely of longtime opponents of nuclear power, do when the spoil is a reactor?
"When you see all the equipment down there, it makes you feel like we should do something here," said Richard M. Kessel, the authority's chairman.
But if life as a reactor has been ruled out, it is far from clear what should be done. After scrambling to make up for the loss of Shoreham, Long Island no longer has a need for power in the short term. And as the tour progressed today, it was apparent that most of the $5.5 billion invested was irrelevant. The land can be re-used, of course, as well as some of the equipment.
The authority thinks a rebuilt Shoreham could replace aging plants that Lilco runs on oil, but other options include performing major maintenance on those plants to extend their lives, or replacing parts of them to make them run on gas too.
 
'Low Mileage'
 Still, the authority's request for proposals has drawn strong interest. Bechtel has formed a team with General Electric, CMS Energy and Long Lake Energy to devise a bid for conversion of the plant; another team was formed by the New York Power Authority, United Engineers and Constructors, Siemens and Enron, and Westinghouse and Stone & Webster have a third team. Several other companies also sent representatives.
With a little bit of the atmosphere of a used car lot, Mr. Kessel prompted plant officials to describe how various plant systems are kept oiled, dehumidified and otherwise ready. "To some extent, it's like new equipment, isn't it?" he asked the day watch engineer, Alexander M. Bodan, as Mr. Bodan showed the sales prospects around the control room.
"To some extent, it's like low mileage," Mr. Bodan replied.
For the record: Plant officials say they turn the turbines for 15 minutes every week. The generator is filled with dry air, and the major electric pumps have been lifted off their bearings to relieve the pressure. Interested parties should apply to the Long Island Power Authority, Garden City, L.I. No reasonable offer refused.

HEADLINE: Hate Groups Seen Growing As Neo-Nazis Draw Young

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Feb. 18

 BODY:
The number of white supremacist hate groups increased significantly in 1991, a private nonprofit group that monitors such activity says.
The annual report by Klanwatch, based in Montgomery, Ala., noted that the trend was accompanied by more violent oratory from the newer and more militant groups. At the same time, the Klanwatch report said many of the more traditional groups were stressing political action in some of their new appeals and avoiding talk of hatred and violence. 
 The study prepared by Klanwatch, an arm of the Southern Poverty Law Center, found a 27 percent increase in the number of white supremacist groups, mainly in northern Georgia, Florida, Southern California, along the Northeast corridor and around Chicago. There were 346 groups with mailing addresses or publications or involved in sponsoring meetings or demonstrations around the country, said Klanwatch's director, Danny Welch, adding that there may be more. Last year the study showed there were 273 such groups.
Several researchers involved in the study said the increase in such groups was largely a result of the discontent caused by the recession.
 
Rise in Hate Is Doubted
 But the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, a highly regarded intelligence-gathering agency of the state police, says it is skeptical of Klanwatch's conclusions. John Bankhead, a spokesman for the agency and its anti-terrorist unit, which issues annual reports on terrorist activities in the state, said that the membership of white supremacist groups in Georgia had been pretty stable over the last few years and he doubted that there had been any increase in the number of such groups in the state.
"The problem is that every Klan member wants to be a Klan leader and so they break off and start their own groups, but the numbers of people involved overall changes very little," Mr. Bankhead said. "It might be accurate to say the number of groups increased, but it might not be accurate, based on what we see in Georgia, to conclude that the number of people involved in the groups has increased."
The Klanwatch report comes as the Justice Department is nearing the end of the first year of gathering statistics nationally on the number of hate crimes committed in the United States. A 1990 Federal law, the Hate Crimes Statistics Act, which directs the Justice Department to gather data on bias-related crimes, was enacted after a decade-long increase in race-related violence, anti-Semitic attacks and attacks on homosexuals. It was intended to help law-enforcement analyze how best to combat such crimes.
Tom Jones, a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said the agency's uniform crime reporting unit had completed initial training of law-enforcement officials in all 50 states who would be charged with identifying the bias crimes covered by the law. The gathering of the data did not begin until April 1991, he said, and the first report is not due until August 1992.
 
Prosecution Data Sought
 While the law's supporters generally like the progress the Justice Department has made in gathering the data, Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, said through a spokesman that he was still troubled that the statistics would not reflect actual prosecutions of bias cases.
"That would not only give us a better sense of the extent of the problem but a better sense of the extent to which it is going unpunished," said Bob McCarson, the spokesman for Mr. Schumer.
Mr. Welch said that the survey indicated that the number of groups espousing anti-Semitic, anti-black philosophies like those of the Ku Klux Klan had risen to 97 in 1990 from 69 the previous year. Similar increases were seen in the neo-Nazi, "skinhead" and "Aryan race" groups, to 203 from 160.
In recent years there has been a leveling off in the number of Klan-type groups, said Mr. Welch, as younger people rejected the robes and ritual in favor of paramilitary type groups like skinheads and neo-Nazis. He also said the newer groups with "the glamour leaders" like Shawn Slater, a skinhead, attracted attention in news reports.
But more recently, Mr. Welch said, the two groups have converged as the skinheads have aged and the Klan groups have adapted their message.
In the last year, said the report, Thom Robb, the head of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, repeatedly asserted that the group did not hate anyone but "loved the white race." The Florida leader of the Invisible Empire, Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, a different group, urged his members to "become a group known for hating evil, instead of being a group known for hating Negroes," while his North Carolina counterpart in the same group barred violent neo-Nazis from its gatherings.

HEADLINE: Libya, Fearing Attack, Braces for Clash With West

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRIPOLI, Libya, Feb. 18

 BODY:
In the face of threatened sanctions and possible military action over the 1988 terrorist bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, Libya is bracing for what it apparently believes is an inevitable confrontation with the West.
Along the coast, bulldozers have gouged out huge trenches to thwart what officials say might be an invading force. Machine-gun nests have been set up outside communications centers and Government offices. Merchant ships from Italy, China and Turkey clog the harbor unloading grain and goods, including spare parts for the country's industries, to be stockpiled in the event of an embargo. 
 And telegrams of support for the country, from groups as obscure as the participants in the Palestine Cup marathon race in Morocco, are broadcast daily to bolster morale and assure the populace of international solidarity.
The Government, rejecting assertions by Britain and the United States that two of its citizens were behind the December 1988 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland, which left 270 people dead, has refused to comply with a demand last month by the United Nations Security Council that the two men be extradited for trial.
 
A Libyan Hearing
 Libyan officials have instead offered numerous theories for the plane's destruction, including one put forth by the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, who contends that the jet crashed into a Scottish gas station in bad weather rather than exploding in midair.
The Libyans havealso denied charges that they were involved in the 1989 bombing of a French U.T.A. airliner, Flight 772, over the Sahara that left 170 people dead.
Apparently in an effort to help bolster their case, Libyan officials invited "the world's journalists" to attend a court hearing today with the two suspects in the Lockerbie bombing, who are accused by the West of being Libyan intelligence agents. The Libyans say the men, Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifah Fhiman, are civilian employees of Libyan Airlines.
 
Court Without Evidence
 But Judge Ahmed al-Tawer al-Zawi, appointed by the Libyan authorities to oversee the case, announced -- after a three-hour wait in which two described as the suspects were whisked past the press by police officers toting machine guns -- that it was never his intention to hold a hearing since there was no evidence against the men.
"This is a press conference," he said, seated at a desk as some 100 bewildered foreign journalists who had flown in from Europe and other Middle Eastern countries stood packed together in a small room in the court. "I know nothing about a public hearing."
When asked why the two men had been brought to the court, he said he did not know.
"They frequently come in for questioning," he said.
He said that the two men were not allowed to travel outside the country or leave their homes at night.
"This is so they can't run away," he said, "or perhaps commit suicide."
The brief appearance of the two men -- during which one said "we are not guilty" but neither was allowed to answer reporters' questions -- seemed intended in part to put to rest reports that Libya had hidden or executed the suspects to forestall Western attempts to have them tried abroad. This was the first time Libya had publicly presented the men.
[In Washington, the State Department spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, dismissed the Libyan presentation, saying: "We don't put much faith or credence in what a Libyan judge might say. We think that a Libyan investigation or a hearing is a travesty of justice, amounts to nothing more than another attempt by Libya to delay and to evade its responsibility."]
 
Prospect of Sanctions
 This country is now riveted on the prospect of economic sanctions, a possibility raised by Western nations as the next step if Libya fails to comply with the United Nations resolution.
The United States and Britain also have not ruled out military action, and people here have hardly forgotten the 1986 American bombing raid on this capital city after an earlier instance of a terrorist attack blamed on Libya, a discotheque bombing in West Germany.
Thus the palpable nervousness here. The state-controlled press is full of messages of support for Libya's fight against "neo-Christian colonialist aggression." Public meetings and marches take place almost daily.
One of the latest rallies to denounce the proposed sanctions was held by the Club of the International Communities Women that assailed "the new colonialist campaign" from a podium at the College of the Martyrs of the Failed American NATO Barbaric Aggression.
The Arab Libyan community in Chad, the Vietnamese chairman of the Telecommunications Trade Union and the Islamic Cultural Center in Togo all stand firmly behind the Libyan regime, according to local press reports.
In a state where dissent is not a wise idea, few Libyans speak openly against either the regime or its leader.
But in Tripoli's old market, which was opened two years ago for private trade, one young man stood and surveyed dozens of Somalis squatting over small piles of clothing and trinkets for sale.
"Most of us have given up trying to understand what our Government is doing," he said.
The erratic and often inexplicable Libyan response to the prospect of sanctions includes a detailed plan to call for a special session of the United Nations General Assembly "to define international terrorism" and address what the Libyans say are a "host of other serious issues."
The four-page proposal begins with a call to ban all offensive weapons in the world, including warships and warplanes, especially those that can "refuel in the air." It also calls for the placement of medical crews on all planes and boats as well as the prohibition of boxing and "races exhausting to animals." It demands the elimination of the world's locusts and "the establishment of an international irrigation system banning the flow of rivers, rain and snow into the sea and oceans."
This is nothing new for the Libyan Government. Colonel Qaddafi's whims, like his flamboyant wardrobe and political bible, the Green Book, are often puzzling.
The Libyan leader was a frequent public supporter of what he defined as "liberation movements," including organizations like the Irish Republican Army and the Basque separatist group E.T.A., until a few months ago.
But lately he has disavowed those groups, saying he was duped.
Diplomats contend that the country's foreign policy is as capricious as its ruler and can, without warning, suddenly be reversed.
"People had thought there was a new Qaddafi," said a European diplomat, "more mature -- someone who was beginning to behave like an international statesman. It is as if he can only be held back so long and then he lets loose."

HEADLINE: Hoboken to Decide Future of Waterfront

BYLINE: By EVELYN NIEVES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOBOKEN, N.J., Feb. 18

 BODY:
Hoboken voters will soon decide the fate of their city's soul.
At issue is the future of Hoboken's waterfront, the crusty spirit of this mile-square city on the Hudson. Next month, for the second time in less than two years, the public will vote on a proposal to develop the once-bustling port, renewing a bitter debate between City Hall and a citizens' coalition that was largely responsible for defeating the first proposal. 
 Under the city's plan, a scaled-down version of one defeated in July 1990 by only 12 votes, nearly two million square feet of land would be leased to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which would develop it. The initial phase would include a 33-story office tower and a hotel on Hoboken's southernmost pier, adjacent to its busy PATH, bus and ferry terminals, and a new park. City officials say the first phase of the plan would create 1,000 permanent jobs and stabilize property taxes by increasing revenues.
But the group lobbying against the plan, the Coalition for a Better Waterfront, charges, among other things, that the city's proposal gives too much control to the Port Authority, closes off part of the waterfront and overwhelms Hoboken's small-town character and quirky charm.
 
Voters Are Tired
 Many people here say the voters are tired of hearing about the moldering waterfront and will probably approve the city's plan. But in a move that will probably intensify the debate, on Wednesday the coalition plans to present an alternative that will give voters a choice to consider before the March 31 referendum.
A coalition spokesman, Ron Hine, said the unwrapping of a 12-foot model of the group's plan, which involves Hoboken's entire mile-long waterfront, from the old Erie-Lackawanna terminal at the southern end of town to the Weehawken Cove on the north, will end doubts about the coalition's commitment to development.
While maintaining the water's edge as a public walkway the length of the city, the coalition plan calls for 19 blocks of commercial and residential development that its proponents describe as being in character with the city's existing architecture. It would also add 24 acres of parks to Hoboken's 12 acres of existing green space.
"This," said Mr. Hine, "is precisely what the city lacks: a vision. It could not be more symbolic that they have created a plan that goes from First to Second Street, after spending over $1 million over the last three years to study it."
To Craig Whitaker, a Manhattan architect hired by the coalition to design its plan, the city's proposal encompasses the "worst of the 80's building frenzy and urban renewal."
"What is important is bulk, scale and height," he said. "We want to have low-rise high density, in keeping with Hoboken, as opposed to high-rise high density, the mistake many cities made along their waterfronts during the 80's commercial boom."
 
One Advantage: A Tenant
 But some Hoboken residents say the city's plan has one undeniable advantage, a committed tenant. Peggy E. Thomas, director of the city's Department of Planning and Community Development, said that while both plans endorse development, a goal most residents favor, only the city's plan has a backer, the Port Authority, "ready to sign a 50-year lease as soon as the plan is passed."
The Port Authority has leased the city's piers since 1952, when it signed a 50-year agreement with the Federal Government to run a maritime shipping terminal. It first expressed interest in developing the waterfront more than a decade ago and in 1984 successfully lobbied the legislatures in New York and New Jersey to pass a law allowing it to get involved in such a project. But it has since contended with deep community opposition and negotiations with three city administrations.
After much debate, there is little elected opposition to the current plan. Anthony Russo, the only one of the nine City Council members who voted against the plan, said politics has interfered with objectivity. "The Port Authority comes out ahead much further than the city," he said. Mr. Russo objects to the agreement that would give the authority the first option to develop as well as the right of first refusal. He also objects to the city's giving the Port Authority a $10.2 million lien on the pier.
The city, which spent a $7 million upfront payment the authority gave the city as part of the abortive earlier plan, is practically giving its land away, Mr. Russo argued.
 
Eagerness for a Deal
 Public uneasiness over the decaying, almost abandoned port has made some people here eager for a deal, especially since the Maxwell House coffee plant is about to close, tentatively on April 1. Chris Onieal, president of the Hoboken Food and Beverage Association, a group of bar and restaurant owners, said a hunger for "something to be built" has swayed him to endorse the city's proposals.
"Five years ago, there were all kinds of people eager to build on the waterfront," he said. "Now, there is no one left."
But Mr. Onieal added that his organization has been heavily lobbied by those on both sides of the issue, with no consensus from the members. "We're polling our membership right now to see whether they should endorse a plan," he said, "and if so, which plan. I know how I feel, but not everyone feels the same way."
With hundreds of members, both newcomers and longtime residents, the coalition hopes to sway the undecided. Mr. Hine said the group has registered 1,000 voters, has put 3,000 names on its mailing list and plans a telephone campaign.
"The community is still bitterly divided over this issue," Mr. Hine said. "You would think that politicians, if they saw that half the public was so opposed to this, would adjust it to meet their constituents."
But Ms. Thomas contended that the community is not quite so divided. "I haven't seen" the new plan, she said.
"But I know they are endorsing development," she said. "So are we. So is everybody. We all want basically the same thing."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Bond Prices Fall Sharply

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
A move by the Federal Reserve Board intended to spur commercial bank lending was received poorly in the fixed-income markets yesterday. Bond prices fell sharply and interest rates rose as market participants, already nervous about recent signs of an incipient upturn in the economy that could ignite inflation, viewed the Fed's action as another potential source of strength.
Around noon the Fed surprised the market by announcing that it would reduce bank reserve requirements to 10 percent from 12 percent, effective April 2. 
 The announcement came one day before the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, issues the semiannual report to Congress on the economy and monetary policy. Traders said they did not like the timing of the move any more than they did its implications.
"This just shows the Fed needs to do whatever it can to get the economy going, even though they have recently said they have done enough," one government securities trader said.
 
More Money in the Economy
 "This will put another $10 billion to $20 billion back into the economy, even though there are some signs that the economy is picking up. And it also means that the next thing they are going to do is ease short-term rates again."
Even though most data released since the start of the year portray an economy that is still wallowing, for the last six weeks credit market participants have chosen to focus on signs that a quick rebound may be coming, and in the process have pushed bond yields up sharply.
Analysts said they were somewhat surprised by the Fed's decision, but added that market reaction to the step was overblown.
"I would have thought the market reaction would have been positive, not negative, because the Fed's move shows it is still concerned about the economy," said Darwin L. Beck, an economist at the First Boston Corporation.
Jay N. Woodworth, senior domestic economist at the Bankers Trust Company, said the move would do something to stimulate bank lending, although not as much as cuts in short-term interest rates already engineered by the Fed.
"This is one more in a series of efforts by the central bank to help the American economy," Mr. Woodworth said. "But this does not radically transform the outlook."
The Fed move transformed what up to that point had been a generally sleepy post-holiday trading session.
Reaction to the announcement was primarily telescoped into prices of long-term notes and bonds, securities that are most susceptible to shifts in sentiment about future movements in the economy and inflation.
By late yesterday, the 8 percent 30-year Treasury bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 1007/32 , down 27/32 to yield 7.97 percent, compared with 7.90 percent late Friday, the last trading day before the Washington's Birthday holiday on Monday.
In the secondary market for Treasury notes, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 1007/32 in late trading, down 18/32 , to yield 7.46 percent. But prices of the 4 7/8 percent two-year notes were unchanged, at 9910/32 , to yield 5.24 percent.
Rates at the regular auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills rose from levels recorded at last week's sale.
 
Treasury Bills Auctioned
 Three-month Treasury bills were auctioned yesterday at an average discount rate of 3.83 percent, up from an average rate of 3.72 percent a week earlier.
Bids on the new six-month bills generated an average discount rate of 3.93 percent, compared with an average rate of 3.80 percent at last week's auction.
New-issue activity in the investment-grade corporate bond market was highlighted by the sale of $400 million worth of five-year noncallable notes by the General Motors Corporation.
The 7 5/8 percent notes, which mature Feb. 15, 1997, were priced at $99.976, to yield 7.63 percent, one percentage point over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 6 1/4 percent five-year notes at the time of pricing.
Morgan Stanley & Company acted as lead manager for the underwriting. The issue is rated A-2 by Moody's Investors Service and A by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Baker Hughes Inc. offered $150 million worth of seven-year notes through an underwriting group led by the First Boston Corporation.
The 7 5/8 percent noncallable notes, which mature Feb. 15, 1999, were priced at $99.438 to yield 7.73 percent, 70 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 6 3/8 percent seven-year notes at the time of pricing.
 
In the Secondary Market
 The securities are rated A-3 by Moody's and A- by Standard & Poor's.
Participants in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds said prices of most issues dipped by 1/8 of a point to 1/4 of a point in light trading.
A flood of new tax-exempt securities expected to be priced today dampened activity in the secondary market for municipal bonds.
By far the largest issue scheduled to be priced today is a $1.3 billion offering from the State of California. But an additional $800 million or more of new securities are expected to be offered by other states and localities.
In advance of the California offering, traders said the new securities were expected to be offered with a maximum yield of around 6.60 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: The Soundings From Reading

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: READING, Pa., Feb. 13

 BODY:
Since the autumn of 1990, when the nation's ninth and longest postwar recession was beginning to unfold, The New York Times has been taking periodic soundings of developments in Reading and surrounding Berks County, an old-line industrial area with a modern mix of retailing, manufacturing and services that is fairly typical of the Northeast.
The occasional articles, consisting mainly of interviews with business people, workers and shoppers, have sought to capture current economic reality and, by extension, some idea of the immediate future. 
 The first one, 15 months ago, found Reading in malaise and braced for recession, an economic condition formally designated by the National Bureau of Economic Research the following April. The next look, last February, found this city of row houses and blue collars clearly mired in the reality of recession.
By April, however, some hopeful signs had emerged as The Times focused on the Glen-Gery Corporation, a Reading-based brick maker that reported an upturn in demand that it thought might be more than seasonal. But here and elsewhere, the spring recovery proved elusive.
In June, amid mixed signals, Reading was expecting a rebound by Labor Day but after school started and many of the nation's economists said recovery was at hand, people here said they did not think so.

HEADLINE: Still Awaiting Proof in Reading, Pa.

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: READING, Pa., Feb. 13

 BODY:
Ronald K. Buckley, vice president of a furniture store on Penn Street here, says his customers are gradually beginning to return again, which he sees as a sign that the long-delayed economic upswing is poised to begin.
"Those that are ready are going to do business," Mr. Buckley said, referring to his fellow merchants here and around the nation. "Those that are not are going to miss the boat." 
 Reading and its Berks County environs, the subject of periodic visits by The New York Times since the recession started in 1990, shows other signs of an economic pickup. One place is the housing market, which at the national level President Bush says will lead the economy's revival.
This return to Reading found that the dominant view remains one of wariness and skepticism, with people inclined to await proof of an upturn rather than anticipate it.
But discussions here with a wide range of business executives and other residents found frequent expressions of somewhat higher confidence in the economy. The feelings seem to reflect the presence of money freed up by large-scale mortgage refinancing. And, less tangibly, there is an attitude among many workers that if they have not yet lost their jobs -- 19 months after the recession began -- perhaps they no longer need hold their breath.
Automobile dealerships say more people are coming in. And aided by generous rebates and other incentives, sales are higher at some showrooms.
"We saw a tremendous rebound in January," with 73 cars sold, said Bill Ramsey, fleet manager for Lindgren Mazda, which also deals in Chryslers and Plymouths.
Bernard M. Markstein 3d, economist for Meridian Bancorp, the area's biggest bank, suggested that "people are just tired of feeling bad."
Yet Mr. Buckley's own behavior, like that of many executives and workers here, is doing little to help hasten the elusive upturn. While his family-owned Gilbert's Furniture managed to limit its 1991 sales decline to 1 percent, neither he nor many other local retailers or manufacturers are building the inventories that would be needed to meet any stepped-up demand.
That, in turn, means few companies are hiring workers whose wages and renewed spirits would help lift the local economy. Carpenter Technology, a large producer of specialty steel that is one of the area's leading employers, drew more than 1,500 applicants last month for two dozen entry-level jobs paying $8.50 an hour.
 
Waiting for Proof
 Lack of consumer confidence is a main factor in the recovery's delay, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, has said repeatedly. A sense that one's job is secure -- or at least that there are others to be had -- is essential if consumers are going to open their wallets.
Mr. Buckley, for example, says he has no incentive to add to his stocks of furniture, because in the current slack period Thomasville and his other suppliers can deliver case goods, such as tables and beds, in as little as a week or two. And upholstery deliveries, he said, take only three to six weeks, compared with six to eight weeks a year ago and as long as 22 weeks in booming 1988.
Nor is Bill M. Sheeler adding to inventory at his computer store out on Perkiomen Avenue, southeast of town, despite brisker demand recently from his business customers. Because computer prices tend to decline, the equipment loses value while awaiting buyers.
 
A Plant Will Soon Close
 Meanwhile, Black & Decker last month began laying off the 115 employees at its suburban Temple plant, which makes Molly fasteners, a type of wall anchor. This operation came with the company's 1989 acquisition of the Emhart Corporation, but did not fit Black & Decker's strategic plan. The plant will be shut by early April and the company has no other plants in the area to which employees could be transferred.
And just up the pike, the used-car lot formerly occupied by Frank Borek, who in September vowed that "I'm out of here" if business did not pick up, now stands vacant. Real estate brokers report a substantial rise in people looking -- and a small increase in sales. But they complain of tighter loan rules by banks and of super-choosy buyers taking full advantage of a wide selection of homes at steady or declining prices.
One broker, Jean A. Schwenger of Wertz, Hoffman, Parks, said she had shown 37 houses to a man moving here from Illinois, so far without a contract for her efforts. "There's no such thing as an easy deal," Ms. Schwenger said.
Over the winter, the deal under which a downtown landmark, the vacant Abraham Lincoln Hotel, was to have been sold and converted to low-income housing fell through, a victim -- at least in part -- of government budget cuts. The main activity in commercial and industrial space is bargain-hunting by "vultures" with ready cash, according to Sidney G. Knoblauch, a leading real estate broker and one of the few business people hereabouts who say they are extremely busy these days.
While the national news media are now giving much attention to the prospect of legislation to spur the economy, Reading seemed to be paying little attention as the House Ways and Means Committee began its deliberations last week. Whereas economists have been fretting, lest the uncertainty inhibit decision-making by consumers and businesses, the inclination here was to dismiss any Washington actions as not likely to help much.
Indeed, talks with people at the unemployment office suggested that Federal efforts in recent months to extend benefits have helped prolong jobless spells as well as ameliorate the pain. Ronald Good, a 27-year-old roofer, said he had been unemployed for about a year but was reluctant to look for other work, despite being forced to sign his house over to his sister and move back in with his parents. He cited the risk of losing standing with the roofers' union if he were to take up other work, but his idleness was sustained by what is now a maximum of 46 weeks of benefits.
"The job market's still soft," observed Louis F. Lauer, manager of the Pennsylvania State Job Service office here. He now has 6,500 Berks County people on his roles compared with about 5,000 last fall. The average spell of joblessness has climbed by about a month, to 16 weeks, matching the national average.
Three employment casualties are from the Berks Products Corporation building materials store in Temple, where Glenn Unger, the manager, has cut his 15-member staff to 12 in the last couple of months. He says business will have to get "a lot better" before he considers hiring again.
At the same time, however, Mr. Unger says he is cautiously raising his stocks in response to the pickup in new housing construction and to a tightness in supplies of lumber caused partly by environmental disputes.
"The key," he said, "is who is going to have inventory" to meet resurgent demand.
 
A Little Less Skeptical
 Paul R. Roedel, chairman of Carpenter Technology, describes his business as "turning up a tad," with strength in components for cars and appliances not shared by its military, aerospace and oilfield products. The company is holding its inventories of finished goods -- 70 percent of billings are shipped from the shelf -- but continues to reduce inventories of work in process.
"I'm a little bit skeptical" that recovery is on the way, Mr. Roedel said, "but less so than two months ago."
And a vice chairman of Meridian Bancorp, Terry L. Troupe, said there was was as yet no significant demand from business for loans, either to rebuild inventories or to expand operations.
"To really say we are turning the corner, we like to see greater consumer confidence," Mr. Troupe added. "One thing would be just getting the consumer to feel his job is secure."
 
A New Liquidity
 One heartening thing, however, is that an "unbelievable" volume of mortgage refinancing is putting money in consumers' hands, Mr. Troupe said, adding that this money is being kept highly liquid and available for spending instead of being tied up in, say, certificates of deposit.
Goodwill Industries, not surprisingly, reports brisks business at its thrift shops here but so does Helene G. Singer, president of Singer Travel. She called last month the best January she ever had, with business travel "gone crazy" even though the leisure market remained spotty.
And officials at the Crompton & Knowles Corporation, the biggest American-owned producer of fabric dyes, say their business has steadied after a drop-off late last year that contributed to a mostly involuntary inventory buildup.
"It's a fashion business," said David S. Alcorn, a vice president at the company's nearby plant in Gibraltar, the company's largest factory. "Most encouraging to us," he added, contemplating the possible lifting of economic gloom, "is the continued popularity of black." Black, he explained, uses more dye than other colors.

GRAPHIC: Photos: In Reading, Pa., there are some signs that economic recovery is in sight. At the Lindgren auto dealership, Bill Ramsey, left, the fleet manager, saw a rebound in sales last month. But at a local employment office, a hand-lettered list of local companies that are not accepting applications provides evidence that many companies are not hiring workers, whose wages would give the local economy a much-needed lift.

HEADLINE: Democrats' Tax Plan Gets Going Over by Republicans

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 18

 BODY:
Republicans turned up the volume of their verbal assault on the House Democrats' tax plan today, saying it did little for the middle class and less for economic growth.
Coordinated, but not entirely consistent, attacks were issued from the White House, the Treasury and House and Senate. 
 Marlin Fitzwater, President Bush's spokesman, said that when Mr. Bush met with House G.O.P. leaders today, they agreed that the public and the Democrats would soon "realize that they have got an empty shell on their hands, or a turkey, as the case may be, and I suspect that they'll start changing the baby pretty quickly."
Echoing criticisms Monday by Richard G. Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mr. Fitzwater said: "The Democratic plan has little if any economic stimulus; it breaks the budget agreement; it would cause a sequester that cuts Medicare, student loans and farm payments. It raises taxes by moving the top rate to 35 percent. It does nothing for home building. It provides 25 cents a day for two years to a family of four in tax cuts at a cost of $90 billion a year in tax increases."
 
The Calculation
 The 25-cents-a-day figure was derived by taking the two years of tax credits -- up to a maximum of $400 for families with incomes of about $26,000 a year or more -- and dividing that $800 by the 731 days of the two years and then by all four members of the "typical" family.
Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Senate G.O.P. leader, did the arithmetic a bit more precisely when he said the cut would give "a dollar-ten a day to the average Ameican family." Actually, it works out to $1.09 a day, or 27 1/4 cents per family member.
Senator Pete V. Domenici Republican of New Mexico, put it more casually, saying it would be worth "a couple of candy bars a day."
Another set of Republican charges concerned the additional tax increases they contended would follow when the Democrats tried to extend the credits in another two years.
While the Democratic plan violates the budget agreement by not paying for itself on a year-by-year basis, it is balanced over six years by increasing maximum tax rates to 35 percent for couples with taxable income of $145,000 and individuals at $85,000, and providing a 10 percent surtax of taxable income over $1,000,000.
 
Fitzwater Agrees
 But Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the House minority leader, said that to make the credit permanent Democrats were "going to have to raise the marginal tax rate up to 50 percent."
Mr. Fitzwater agreed, saying that was "what we've always said about the Democrats -- they just want to get their foot in the door, permanent taxes, and then turn it all to spending."
At the Treasury, Secretary Nicholas F. Brady calculated it somewhat differently, forecasting a Democratic scheme to keep the same maximum rate but to impose it on couples with taxable incomes of $50,000 and individuals at the $35,000 level.
Mr. Brady argued, moreover, that no economists believed the Democrats had "an economically sound program that will create jobs." And he insisted that Mr. Bush still eagerly supported a $500 increase in the personal exemption for children, a part of his larger package, but "at this particular point in time what he wants is his seven points," which include a capital gains tax cut, accelerated depreciation, but not the increased exemption.
A spokesman for Mr. Brady later said that the Administration would be happy to see the exemption added, but only if it were paid for through cuts in spending.

HEADLINE: C.D. and Bank Fund Yields Continue to Fall

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
Yields on bank money market accounts and certificates of deposit continued to ease in the week ended yesterday, according to The Bank Rate Monitor, which tracks bank rates.
"Short-term certificate of deposit yields -- three and six months -- continue to flatten out, but the strongest signal that the down cycle may be ending is that yields on longer-term accounts, such as five-year certificates of deposit, have begun to inch upward," Robert K. Heady, publisher of The Monitor, said yesterday. "That reflects the usual pattern of short-term yields lagging the long-term numbers, which generally indicate the next trend." 
 It appears that the Federal Reserve's announcement yesterday of a reduction in the reserve requirements of its member banks, from 12 to 10 percent on transaction acccounts, could be a way of easing credit conditions without having to cut the discount rate again, according to Mr. Heady.
Among New York area commercial banks, the average money market account yields rose by a basis point, to 3.52 percent. A basis point is a hundredth of 1 percent.
Among the New York-area savings institutions, money-market account yields averaged 4.06 percent, off 6 basis points from a week ago.
For money market accounts, the steepest cut among area banks was by the Brooklyn-based Crossland Savings F.S.B., which lowered its money market rate by 37 basis points. For the sharpest drop in three-month certificates, the Bank of Tokyo Trust led again, with a cut of 22 points; it also cut its six-month certificates by 25 points, more than any other New York area bank.
The Bank Rate Monitor said the average yields at 20 large banks outside the New York area declined by a relatively small amount, down 2 basis points, to 3.62 percent, for money market accounts, and down 1 basis point for six-month certificates, to 3.83 percent.


GRAPHIC: Annual effective yields, in percent, on money market accounts, three-month certificates of deposit and six-month C.D.'s expected at selected institutions on Wednesday,February19,1992. Some C.D. yields assume reinvestment after maturity. Yields are based on the method of compounding and the rate stated for the lowest minimum to open an account, but minimums may vary. Higher yields may be offered for larger deposits. C.D. figures are for fixed rates only.

HEADLINE: Dow Falls By 21.24, To 3,224.73

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
A weak bond market and concern over inflation, which could halt further easing of interest rates, helped undercut stocks yesterday in hectic afternoon trading.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 21.24 points, to 3,224.73. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was heavy, at 234.3 million shares, up from 221 million on Friday. The Big Board composite index was off 2.51 points, to 225.65, with losing issues outnumbering gainers by 1,080 to 714. 
 The decline in the Dow was limited because of strength in transportation issues, which rose smartly as oil prices fell on the news of a smaller-than-expected cut in production by OPEC nations. But oil stocks fared poorly, because lower oil prices usually mean lower profits.
 
Effect of Fed Announcement
 Stocks slid in the afternoon as bond prices fell in reaction to an announcement by the Federal Reserve that it was lowering the amount of money banks are required to hold in reserve against losses. It is hoped that this move will make more money available for lending, but it raised concern among investors about the inflation implications and as to whether it would keep the Fed from lowering interest rates further.
Robert C. Walberg, equity analyst for MMS International, an economic analysis and research firm, said the market's initial reaction to the Fed's announced cut was positive because historically the market rises an average of 22 percent in the 12 months following such a cut.
"In 1990, the last time we had a reserve requirement cut, the market trended lower for about a month before coming back and making the 22 percent," he said. "But keep in mind that was during the gulf war period."
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 5.10 points, to 407.38, with international oils, drugs, health care and food stocks among its weak sectors.
Birinyi Associates, which tracks program trading, said the market was subjected to two buy programs in the morning and seven sell programs in the afternoon, which had a total net effect of pulling the Dow down 28.86 points. The sell programs alone pulled the index down 42.28 points.
Heavy trading was also apparent on the American Stock Exchange, as the composite fell 5.07 points, to 409.20. The Nasdaq index fall 10.02 points, to 626.41 points, while the Russell 2,000 dropped to 210.08, down 1.48 points.
The OPEC production cut hurt oil stocks but helped airline issues. Mobil was off 2, to 61 7/8; Exxon 1 1/8, to 57 1/8; Royal Dutch Petroleum 1 3/4, to 77 1/2; ARCO 1 1/2, to 103 7/8; British Petroleum 2 3/8, to 55 7/8, and Texaco 2 3/4, to 57 3/4.
 
Gains for Airline Stocks
 But airline stocks led the transport index up on the prospects of lower fuel costs. AMR rose 2, to 76; UAL was up 2 1/4, to 148 1/8, and Delta Air Lines gained 1 3/4, to 70.
Shares of Walt Disney, which scrapped plans to build a movie theme park in Tokyo near its existing Disneyland and announced a 4-for-1 stock split, rose 3 1/2, to 146 1/2.
Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette cut two stocks from its recommended list: the Imcera Group, a maker of health-care products, off 4 1/8, to 34 1/8, and Wheelabrator Technologies, a pollution control concern, down 2 1/4, to 32 1/2. The firm added to its list Showboat, an entertainment concern, up 1 5/8, to 11 1/4, and Rasterops, a software company, up 1 7/8, to 20.
 
Barron's Article on Marvel
 Marvel Entertainment Group fell 11 3/8, to 54 5/8, following a negative article about the comic-book publisher in Barron's over the weekend. Terry Stewart, Marvel's president, who disputed the article, is said to have had conversations with a number of analysts yesterday.
Reebook International rose 2 1/4, to 35, as Margaret Gilliam, an analyst with First Boston, repeated a strong buy recommendation. The maker of athletic shoes said its newly formed Reebok Sport unit to market performance sporting equipment would be headed by Robert Muller, former president of Champion footwear's parent.
Van Dorn shares fell sharply, to 13 5/8, down 5 3/8, after Crown Cork and Seal ended its offer to acquire the packaging and container company for $20 a share, traders said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Hopes of Stronger Economy Push Dollar Sharply Higher

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar moved up sharply yesterday amid a growing perception that the United States economy is getting stronger.
Gold prices closed lower, falling 30 cents on the Commodity Exchange in New York, to $353.40 an ounce. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $352.80, down 45 cents. 
 Analysts said the dollar rose as more traders became convinced that the economy was recovering and that interest rates would remain stable or move higher.
The dollar, like all currencies, tends to rise along with interest rates. Higher yields make United States investments more attractive to foreigners, who must buy dollars to make their purchases.
Traders' confidence in the economy was bolstered by, among other things, a stronger-than-expected increase in retail sales in January that was announced last week.
Analysts said traders' enthusiasm overshadowed concerns that central banks might enter the currency markets to stop the dollar's advance. The Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan intervened for the second time in a month on Monday, selling dollars against the Japanese yen.
Mike Faust, a currency market analyst with MMS International, said the market was "a little bit leery of pushing the dollar" above 128 yen, but also wanted to see the dollar move higher.
He noted that the dollar was reaching the levels where the Fed and the Bank of Japan stepped in Monday, but that traders might bid it higher if there was no widespread intervention involving banks of other countries.
Analysts said the market would be watching today for the release of data on consumer prices and housing construction in January and for testimony by the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, who will tell Congress about the state of the economy.
The dollar closed at 128.00 yen in New York, up from 127.80 yen late Friday, the last trading day in the United States before the Washington's Birthday holiday. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar rose to 127.17 yen, from 126.93 yen late Monday, and in London, it was quoted at 128.00 yen.
The British pound fell to $1.7545 in New York, from $1.7715 Friday. In earlier London trading, sterling fell to $1.7500, from $1.7740 late Monday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's prices, included: 1.6440 German marks, up from 1.6265; 1.4860 Swiss francs, up from 1.4650; 5.5905 French francs, up from 5.5370; 1,233.25 Italian lire, up from 1,221.25, and 1.18915 Canadian dollars, up from 1.18665.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Price of Crude Oil Plunges On Smaller OPEC Cutback

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Crude oil futures prices plunged more than $1.30 a barrel yesterday after OPEC agreed to cut production less than the market expected.
Gasoline and heating oil futures also fell sharply on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
 Crude oil for delivery in March dropped $1.34, to $18.12 a barrel; March heating oil fell 3.17 cents, to 51.32 cents a gallon, and March unleaded gasoline fell 2.40 cents, to 55.08 cents a gallon. March natural gas rose 0.2 cent, to 1.045 cents for 1,000 cubic feet, but all other natural gas contracts retreated.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed late Saturday to cut 1.2 million barrels of daily production for the spring, when worldwide demand for oil falls with warmer weather.
 
What Was Expected
 Traders had expected the group to make cuts of 1.5 million to 2 million barrels a day in a bid to raise prices.
OPEC was unable to make cuts as big as some members would have liked, because Saudi Arabia insisted on maintaining most of the huge market share it gained after it began pumping to capacity in the wake of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
"That doesn't bode well for the cartel in the near future," said Thomas P. Blakeslee, an energy analyst at the Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J. "The cartel's function is to try to stabilize prices."
In other markets, coffee for March delivery sank 2.40 cents, to 66.70 a pound, on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York. It was the lowest daily settlement of a near-term coffee contract since the summer of 1975.
Coffee prices tumbled amid indications from an International Coffee Organization convention in Florida that the United States would not support a return to limits on coffee exports to support prices.
The last International Coffee Agreement specifying export quotas collapsed in July 1989, when green coffee was priced near $1.40 a pound. Prices have rarely risen above $1 since then.
Coffee futures were also under pressure from weak demand, abundant supplies and expectations for a record-large Colombian crop this year.

TV Journalists' Urge To Prettify the News

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
The report this week that more than two-thirds of the single men and almost a third of the adults in families housed in New York City's shelters are on drugs or alcohol may startle people who are addicted to television news. More often than not, a news story or documentary on the homeless will feature a hard-working, straight-living young couple or an attractive teen-ager and her child who have run into a spell of bad luck.
The reasons for the choices are not obscure. If you want to arouse sympathy for the homeless, you do not put forward off-putting specimens. Television news producers can count on advocacy groups to supply them with model victims for viewing purposes, people who may even be untouched by the other afflictions discovered in the recent survey of the homeless: mental illness, AIDS, domestic violence and lack of education and skills. And why should a producer focus on 1 of the 50 percent of single homeless people who have served time in jail when he can just as easily find someone without a record? 
 Whether the intention is to make a more moving show or build support for programs to help the homeless and possibly reassure viewers about having a small shelter in their neighborhood, the result is a prettifying of reality.
This journalism of the heart is not the greatest sin of the profession. In these tough times, national and local news programs have been reporting almost nightly on people battered by recession. Television has rubbed in the extent and depth of the hardships until even Washington has been compelled to address them, at least with words. Good. The problem comes when advocacy upends journalism, when the facts are drowned in the compassion.
Reports on the homeless often tend to imitate depression-movie scripts: hard-working folks in heart-wrenching situations. If only jobs and housing were provided, they would be like you and me. But suddenly it turns out that the reality for many of the homeless is something different, something much more complicated and less susceptible to easy imagery or quick remedies.
The people who have to bed down in New York City's foul shelters of course deserve sympathy, whether they are hooked on cocaine or not, but how can they be helped unless addiction is taken into account? Any plan to address the pathologies that rage through America's cities requires a sustained commitment, and that requires public understanding and acceptance of what is sure to be a heavy long-term burden. Pretending just won't do.
No journalist, despite the air of authority conferred by the screen, has the solution to any tough subject. The reporter's job is not to prescribe or even to diagnose, but simply to lay out the situation. The rules are elementary: Don't shade reality in the interests of policy or drama; don't round up the usual villains; don't become the accomplice of any interested party. If a journalist wants to make an additional contribution to the homeless, let him do it on his own time.
Maybe viewers will not react to the new picture of the homeless in a welcoming way. Maybe Andrew Cuomo, the chairman of the mayoral commission that dug up the bad news about the people in shelters, is being optimistic when he expresses confidence that the truth will rally a new consensus for action. But that cannot be the journalist's prime professional concern.
Increasingly, it seems to this loyal viewer, news programs and documentaries are putting the power of the camera and the language of melodrama to the service of some cause. Reporters shoot up with chutzpah and turn themselves into advocates. The impulse is understandable and may at times seem admirable, but the tendency is subversive of the journalist's main job, a difficult one to do well in the best of circumstances and the only one a journalist is competent to do or should aspire to do in a democracy, where the populace is supposed to be informed, not manipulated: Tell what is, and let others take it from there.

DEAR Diary:
The other Saturday I agreed to take my 2-year-old to see "Beauty and the Beast" at a local theater in Hastings-on-Hudson. (Twice had not been enough for him). On our way to the theater he fell asleep; nevertheless, I put him on my shoulder and stood in line. Nearing the ticket booth, a selfish plan came to mind. "Two for 'Grand Canyon,' " I said wickedly. I bought my popcorn and sat down, my son still asleep in my lap.
Twenty minutes into the film he woke up. For a few minutes, he watched Danny Glover and Kevin Kline, while silently munching on my popcorn. Suddenly, it hit him. "Where's the beast?" he yelled to me in the quiet auditorium. "Where's the beast?" 
 After a few minutes of rather loud negotiation, we slipped into the theater next door, where we caught the rest of "The Beast." So much for selfish aspirations. -- JOSEPH SCUTIERI

 	 	 		. . .	 	Dear Diary:
The scene is a card store in Bronxville, N.Y. The time, a week or so before Valentine's Day. The cast, a couple, apparently married; they are examining valentine cards in the Husband and Wife section. After making selections, they exchange and read the cards.
He: It's really beautiful. Thanks.
She: How very thoughtful. Thank you, dear.
They wish each other Happy Valentine's Day and kiss. Then they return the cards to the rack and walk out. --JOSEPH A. COYLE

AREN'T YOU GLAD
YOU'RE NOT WEST 81st STREET?
 In New York City
 Amsterdam Avenue
 Is One Way Going
 North.
 It is crossed by
 72d Street, 79th Street
 86th Street and 96th Street.
 They are two-way streets.
 All the others are one way,
 Going East and West.
 Except West 81st Street.
 81st Street is a
 Two-way, one-way street.
 When you drive up Amsterdam Avenue
 On your left, West 81st Street is
 One way West.
 On your right, it's
 One way East
 Until it reaches Columbus Avenue
 Then it becomes
 Two way, and disappears
 Into Central Park
 And comes right out again!
 You think you're confused?
 What about West 81st Street? -- JACK SHOR

 	 	 		. . .	 	Dear Diary:
After years of chewing on murder mysteries as my form of "brain candy," I thought I'd sample westerns for a change of pace. Not sure that a highbrow literary establishment like Shakespeare & Company would even deign to carry that genre, I approached the information desk with some embarrassment.
"Do you have any westerns?" I asked the college-age employee behind the desk. He thought about it for a moment. "Have you read 'All Quiet on the Western Front?' " he asked.
I'm no longer ashamed of my choices in literature. -- STEVE LANCE

 	 	 		. . .	 	The sign stopped Ruth Humleker, among others, in her tracks. It is in the window of her neighborhood dry cleaner, and this is what it says:
"Currently Unemployed? We Care. Let us help you look your best while interviewing for new opportunities. We will clean one suit or one dress per week FREE until you find employment. Call Alan. All arrangements will be kept strictly confidential. (Must present proof of current employment from N.Y. State Unemployment.)"
Alan Rappaport is the current owner of the shop, Julius Klein Cleaners, at Third Avenue and 21st Street, which has been in business for more than 50 years. He told Ms. Humleker, "When you take, you have to put something back." Owning a business in New York City "has become a give-and-take situation," he said, adding, "Over the years I've been on both sides of the fence, and I know too well what it's like to eat macaroni and cheese."

 	 	 		. . .	 	Dear Diary:
He was a hip young messenger in black leather (jacket and Reeboks) and headphones; she, a Murray Hill matron with matching coat and hat. The three of us were waiting to cross Park Avenue. She tapped him on the shoulder.
"Your shoe is untied," she pointed out. "You'd better tie it. You know, you could trip and hurt yourself." Would he do it? I wondered.
He nodded in some bewilderment and bent down to tie his shoe with just enough time to catch the green light.
And they say New Yorkers don't care. -- ELIZABETH A. SPENCER

Another Name for Columbus Day

BYLINE: By HERBERT MITGANG

 BODY:

Black Hills/White Justice
The Sioux Nation Versus the United States, 1775 to the Present
By Edward Lazarus
Illustrated. 486 pages. HarperCollins. $27.50.
 
Native American Testimony
A Chronicle of Indian-White Relations From Prophecy to the Present, 1492-1992
Edited by Peter Nabokov
Illustrated. 474 pages. Viking. $25.
Some American Indians would like to rename Columbus Day in 1992 National Native American Day because they consider the quincentenary of the landing of Christopher Columbus in the Western Hemisphere a day of mourning, not celebration. The reasons can be found in two books that offer essential and often exciting reading about the struggle to preserve Indian life, land and rights. 
 Circling the wagons of history, Edward Lazarus in "Black Hills/White Justice" and Peter Nabokov in "Native American Testimony" bring the story of the checkered relationship between Washington and the Indian tribes up to the present. The shoot-outs are now taking place not with weapons on ancient hunting grounds but with briefs in modern courtrooms.
During President Franklin D. Roosevelt's first term, the Indian Reorganization Act was passed, reversing the longstanding policy of forced Indian assimilation and providing for increased tribal sovereignty. But the fate of the Indians was changed in 1950 when Dillon S. Myer was named Commissioner of Indian Affairs. The symbolism was not lost on the increasingly sophisticated Indians that Mr. Myer had directed the detention program for Americans of Japanese descent during World War II. Mr. Nabokov writes that to Commissioner Myer, Indian reservations were "akin to concentration camps." Without their consent, he wanted to Americanize the Indians and force them to abandon their traditional ways.
During the Eisenhower Administration, this policy of termination, as it was called, reversed the generous benefits of the Indian Reorganization Act. The resulting friction between the Indians and the Federal Government -- and among some Indian leaders themselves -- continues to this day. The attitude of many Indians in their battles against the Federal Government is still best summed up in the bold title of Vine Deloria Jr.'s 1969 book, "Custer Died for Your Sins."
In "Black Hills/White Justice," Mr. Lazarus emphasizes the United States Supreme Court decision in 1980 that resulted in a $106 million award to the Sioux Nation because of the Government's seizure of the Black Hills in South Dakota in violation of an 1868 treaty. Associate Justice Harry A. Blackmun, the strongest voice on the bench for the Sioux, wrote the 8-to-1 opinion on their behalf. Later, Mr. Lazarus was a law clerk for Justice Blackmun and taught constitutional law at the Cardoza School of Law at Yeshiva University. His book is full of inside information because his father, Arthur Lazarus, pursued the case against all odds for more than 20 years and convinced the high court of the justice of the Sioux cause.
The Sioux have let the award sit in the United States Treasury, accumulating interest, because they fear that if they take the money they will give up their claim to the Black Hills. The spectacular Black Hills, a 4,000-foot high ridge 110 miles long and 40 miles wide, once sheltered the great Sioux tribes and are considered a holy place. The legal legacy has grown to more than $300 million. The author sympathizes with those Sioux leaders who want to use the money to build an "economic foundation" for the tribe rather than to continue to make "rhetorical claims" that he says lead only to a victim mentality.
Mr. Lazarus's story of the Sioux Nation is particularly well organized and edited. It includes informative maps, a detailed chronology covering everything from the egomaniacal General Custer at the Little Big Horn to the massacre at Wounded Knee, S.D., to all the Congressional legislation and the futile struggles to save the Indian heritage. Of particular note, an appendix on the Treaty of 1868 between the Sioux and the United States -- the basis for the winning lawsuit in 1980 -- is a remarkable document that provides a vivid picture of life on the Great Plains in the time of the buffalo.
"Black Hills/White Justice" is a book filled with such riches, one of the most original accounts of the Indian past and present in recent years.
The voices of the Indians themselves are heard in "Native American Testimony," an anthology that spans nearly 500 years of Indian and white relations. The book includes hundreds of stories and experiences, from the time of the first encounters with European explorers to the second battle of Wounded Knee in the turbulent 1970's, when armed members of the American Indian Movement began demonstrations, to the current attitude of Indians about Columbus Day celebrations. Mr. Nabokov, the editor of the collection, is an assistant professor of anthropology and American Indian studies at the University of Wisconsin.
The anthology picks up where the well-intentioned but romanticized film, "Dances With Wolves," leaves off. In a foreword, Mr. Deloria tells why so many of the tales read like laments. He writes: "Some of the voices contained herein may appear to be complaining about the loss of land, the loss of a way of life or the continuing propensity of the white man to change the terms of the debate to favor himself. But deep down these are cries about dignity, complaints about the lack of respect." And then he quotes Sitting Bull: "It is not necessary that eagles should be crows."
Mr. Nabokov's own intelligent commentary threads through the pieces in the book. At one point he cites the words of Felix S. Cohen, the eminent legal scholar and a strong advocate for the Indians, who in 1953 said, "Like the miner's canary, the Indian marks the shift from fresh air to poison air in our political atmosphere . . . our treatment of Indians, even more than our treatment of other minorities, reflects the rise and fall of our democratic faith."
N. Scott Momaday, who won the Pulitzer Prize in 1969 for his novel, "House Made of Dawn," has the final say in the collection about the future of the American Indian: "I grew up on Indian reservations, and then I went away from the Indian world and entered a different context. But I continue to think of myself as Indian, I wrote out of that conviction. I think this is what most Indian people are doing today. They go off the reservations, but they keep an idea of themselves as Indians. That's the trick."

HEADLINE: Save Haiti From Its Army

 BODY:
Last September's coup in Haiti brought staggering consequences: more than 1,500 people murdered in the streets . . . tens of thousands fleeing in small boats to the U.S. and other neighboring lands . . . military conspirators emboldened throughout the hemisphere. These disasters derive from one narrow source, Haiti's brutish army, just 7,000 soldiers who terrorize a population of six million.
Haiti's neighbors, working through the Organization of American States, have tried to pressure army leaders. But their economic embargo has proved porous and their diplomatic proposals have been mocked. This month a blundering State Department eased some of the remaining pressure, inviting even greater contempt from Port-au-Prince. 
 To retrieve the situation, a more tough-minded approach may be required: Send in armed O.A.S. peacekeepers to restore order and democracy.
Foreign intervention in political disputes is usually a bad idea. But in Haiti's case, it deserves serious consideration.
One reason outsiders can play a constructive role is that they would be supporting a basic choice already made by Haitians. A million and a half voters overwhelmingly elected Jean-Bertrand Aristide as President 14 months ago. By all accounts, he still commands majority support.
A significant and economically powerful minority, however, opposes President Aristide and fears what might happen if he returns. An O.A.S. force could reassure these people, essential to Haiti's economic functioning, that their rights will be protected from vengeful Aristide partisans.
The army might not politely step aside. But it could, being small, be pushed aside. Should the army resist, to protect its drug and other smuggling rackets, it would find little popular support.
The O.A.S. traditionally dislikes intervening anywhere because Latin American states fear setting precedents that could weaken their own sovereignty. Those fears would be eased if no U.S. troops took part. Most Latin governments now have an equally strong stake in avoiding a different precedent, a successful military coup. Events in Venezuela this month sent shudders through several presidential palaces.
As long as the Haitian army thwarts all attempts at diplomacy, it's hard to see any political remedy for Haiti's suffering. The first need seems increasingly clear: Neutralize the army's tyrannical power.

HEADLINE: 'C'mon Along and Listen To . . .'

 BODY:
In the next three months, something like the old hip hooray and ballyhoo are coming back to Broadway. Twenty-two shows will have opened, almost as many as opened in the entire 1990-91 season. Some of them will probably have the life span of a mayfly. Still, better a brief run than none at all, and besides, who knows?
Among the nine musicals are revivals of "The Most Happy Fella" (already here), "Guys and Dolls" and "Man of La Mancha," none of which employ armies, crashing chandeliers or hovering helicopters. They don't need them. When a show's got "Standin' on the Corner," say, or "Fugue for Tinhorns," scenery recedes. 
 Several of the plays feature big screen stars, some of whom may twinkle very faintly, if at all, on stage. Even so, those names are going to look very good on Broadway marquees -- and Broadway is going to look very good on their resumes.
That's because Broadway is embedded in countless songs, countless books and the memories of countless Americans. For a century tourists coming home from a visit to New York have been greeted with, "Did you take in any Broadway shows?"
Broadway by now is sometimes as much myth as reality. Ticket receipts are way down; ticket prices are still way up; half a million fewer people have shown up so far for this season's offerings than through the same period last year. Maybe one can't fight a recession with singing, dancing and a new Neil Simon play. Never mind. It's optimism that counts, and that will now radiate from 22 marquees.

HEADLINE: Buchanan Shock

 BODY:
Once again, Americans have suddenly been plunged into a cram course in the odd form of calculation called New Hampshire Arithmetic.
In 1968, Senator Eugene McCarthy lost the primary yet his 42 percent shook Lyndon Johnson out of office. In 1976, Ronald Reagan's 49 percent against President Gerald Ford was seen as a defeat. Jimmy Carter's 28 percent, meanwhile, certified him as nationally viable. 
 Pat Buchanan's showing against President Bush belongs on the same seismic scale, the more so considering that he is a newspaper columnist, challenging an incumbent whose popularity recently verged on 90 percent. For three distinct reasons, the outcome produces Buchanan Shock.
One shock is that his showing will be taken, especially abroad, as a sign of ugly nativism and thinly varnished hostility to minorities. Mr. Buchanan denounces being characterized as racist or anti-Semitic. His record, however, remains his record; it now requires searching scrutiny.
He would have no quarrel with the second kind of shock -- that his vote total shows support for a greatly altered American relationship with the world. To call this sentiment isolationism only gives it a dirty name; there are few subjects Americans more sensibly need to thrash out.
The third, indisputable layer of shock comes from yesterday's demonstration of how urgently many voters wanted to protest their economic distress. Exit polling showed, for instance, that voters with unemployment in their families gave Mr. Buchanan a 10-point margin. Half his supporters said they voted for him to send a message. Taken together, the several forms of Buchanan Shock thus ignite either alarm or at least serious and searching attention; the earthquake's not over.
There was New Hampshire Arithmetic on the Democratic side, too. What was Paul Tsongas to most Americans a year ago? Someone with an unpronounceable name. Not even those who presumed he would win, as a favorite-cousin candidate from neighboring Massachusetts, could have confidently predicted he'd win fully a third of the vote.
Yet "A Call to Economic Arms," the title of his cogent 85-page rationale for running, turned out to sound the dominant theme of the campaign. The appeal of Mr. Tsongas's rational approach was especially noticeable among better-educated voters, who favored him almost 2 to 1 over Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas.
New Hampshire Arithmetic probably brought Mr. Clinton some good news, also. His second-place showing, despite the shadow of personal issues, probably discourages the immediate entry of other potential candidates. To plunge in now would risk looking like a predator, whereas if no clear leader emerges in coming weeks, a new candidate might, instead, look like a savior. New Hampshire Arithmetic may be odd, but it counts.

HEADLINE: Massachusetts to Open a Public Science School

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
Citing the need to act quickly to inspire high school students to choose math and science careers despite tight school budgets, Massachusetts officials plan to open a public academy focused on those subjects at Worcester Polytechnic Institute this fall.
The new Massachusetts Academy of Mathematics and Science would be the first such nonresidential, state-financed school of excellence to be housed at an existing college, said one sponsor, State Senator Arthur E. Chase, a Republican from Worcester. The academy would serve high school juniors and seniors, who would compete for admission. 
 Unlike students attending the 10 other statewide academies across the nation specializing in mathematics and science, Massachusetts Academy students would commute rather than live on campus, making the program more economical, Mr. Chase said.
"It's unique," Mr. Chase said. "Where others have spent millions, we'll be spending very little to establish this, and we think we'll be winding up with a better quality program because we're tapping into the resources of one of the finest private colleges in the country."
Worcester Polytechnic Institute is a private engineering college with an undergraduate enrollment of 2,600.
At the North Carolina School for Science and Mathematics in Durham, which was founded in 1980 and is considered the model for such schools, 68 percent of the school's graduates have gone on to major in mathematics or science in college. Nationwide, about 40 percent of high school graduates ranking in the nation's top 10 percent go on to major in those subjects. But the cost per student at the North Carolina school is $13,225 this year; in Durham's public high schools, the cost is $4,517.
Under contract with the state, Worcester Polytechnic Institute would receive a fee to run the academy. The fee for each student would be in the "same range" as the $5,000 average spent per pupil by Massachusetts's public high schools, Mr. Chase said.
 
Little Opposition
 Gov. William F. Weld, a Republican, included $500,000 in his fiscal 1993 budget to start the academy this September with a limited number of students. The financing has not yet been approved by the Legislature, but Lieut. Gov. Paul Cellucci, also a Republican, said he expected the measure to pass.
"If this is effective, we intend to expand it so we can have other programs like this in the state," Mr. Cellucci said.
While the Democrats control both houses of the Legislature, they have expressed no significant opposition to the proposal.
Some education specialists have reacted cooly to the plan, saying that public officials should focus on improving standards in mathematics and science for all students, not just the talented.
"The reform and the financial commitment to all students is extremely important," said Ray Shiflett, executive director of the Mathematical Sciences Education Board, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences. "The potential good for our society and nation in raising the expectations and standards for the rest of our children far outweighs the benefits of any special education program for the gifted," he said.
John P. Polidori, spokesman for the Massachusetts Teachers Association, said: "Governor Weld has hit the right note, but on the wrong key. Math and science education deserve priority attention, but for all children, not an elite few. Public monies should be used at public schools and public colleges. This experiment should be funded by a private source."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: New Hampshire;
BUSH JARRED IN FIRST PRIMARY; TSONGAS WINS DEMOCRATIC VOTE

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEDFORD, N.H., Feb. 18

 BODY:
President Bush received a jarring political message in the New Hampshire primary today, scoring a less-than-impressive victory over Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative commentator.
 With 99 percent of the precincts reporting, Mr. Bush had 58 percent of the vote and Mr. Buchanan 40 percent. 
 On the Democratic side, also with 99 percent of the vote counted, former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts was the winner with 35 percent. Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas was comfortably in second place at 26 percent and in a position to take his resilient candidacy on to the string of primaries in his native South.
The Democratic results left the race for the nomination unsettled, and seemed likely to fuel talk of another candidate's entering the race. The Bush-Buchanan battle also brought Mr. Clinton some relief by taking him out of the glare of the political spotlight, where he has been trapped for the last two weeks in the debate over his draft status during the Vietnam War.
 
Clinton Looks Ahead
 Reflecting Democratic glee over the President's showing, Governor Clinton said, "In November, we will win a great victory against Pat Buchanan."
Mr. Bush, in a statement tonight, said his opponents in both parties had "reaped the harvest of discontent with the pace of New Hampshire's economy" and added, "I understand the message of dissatisfaction."
The signal to Mr. Bush was unmistakable. Even though Mr. Buchanan's support represented more than 63,000 actual votes, it amounted to a roar of anger from those who voted in the Republican primary, and it showed the power of a "send a message" campaign against him in times of economic distress.
Mr. Bush now faces a galvanized Buchanan campaign in one state after another, with the battle to be joined on March 3, when the Buchanan forces hope to make another stand in Georgia. Down the road, Mr. Bush will confront a Democratic Party that has now been given a road map of his vulnerabilities.
 
No Big Push for Cuomo
 In the Democratic race, Senators Tom Harkin of Iowa and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska apparently emerged from the voting neck and neck -- as they were in the polls during the past few weeks. But former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California was right with them, after polls suggested for weeks that he was well behind the pack.
And one "surprise" that some had predicted simply did not materialize: the write-in effort for Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York did not break out of the single digits.
Republicans loyal to Mr. Bush tried to play down the results. The President's political advisers asserted that New Hampshire, with its battered economy and sensitivity to taxes, would be Mr. Buchanan's "high water" mark. But there was alarm in the White House, as the euphoric Buchanan campaign prepared to move ahead, hoping that the New Hampshire result would bring a flood of contributions.
The voting today carried many ominous signs for Mr. Bush. Mr. Buchanan won half of the men who voted in the Republican primary and half of those who identified themselves as conservatives, according to interviews with people leaving the polling places.
Mr. Bush held on to a majority of the Republicans, but Mr. Buchanan carried more than half of the registered independents who chose to vote in the Republican primary. Taken together, the unrest of men, conservatives and independents showed deep fault lines in the coalition that carried Ronald Reagan to power, kept him there and elected Mr. Bush as his heir.
There was much historical irony here: It was New Hampshire that resurrected Mr. Bush's candidacy four years ago, after the then-Vice President placed third in the Iowa caucuses and came limping to this state desperate for affirmation from the voters.
Mr. Buchanan's constant urging to send a message to the White House clearly paid off: three in 10 of those voting in the Republican primary said they wanted, first and foremost, to do that, and they overwhelmingly backed Mr. Buchanan, the survey showed.
Moreover, Mr. Bush was clearly punished for breaking his 1988 pledge to forswear new taxes. Nearly a third of the Republican primary voters said that was "very important" to their vote, and most of them gave their support to Mr. Buchanan.
 
Reading His Lips, Again
 This anti-tax sentiment, some analysts said, was fed by the Bush Administration's decision not to include a $500 increase in the tax exemption for children in a list of high-priority proposals to energize the economy -- a decision that Mr. Buchanan also pounded upon.
Mr. Buchanan began his campaign as a plea to put "America first" and radically redirect the nation's attention to home front concerns, but it was a commercial attacking Mr. Bush for breaking his tax pledge that was the hallmark of his campaign here. Again and again, New Hampshire voters were greeted with the image of Mr. Bush declaring, "Read my lips, no new taxes" in 1988, and were reminded that he broke his promise.
Mr. Buchanan also clearly benefited from his intensive campaigning here, in contrast to the largely long-distance courtship of Mr. Bush.
The wounds suffered by Mr. Bush today made many Democrats agree with Phil Angelides, the California Democratic chairman, who asserted that the Democratic nomination in 1992 was the most valuable since 1976, when the Republicans were reeling from Watergate, and Jimmy Carter defeated President Gerald R. Ford.
But New Hampshire did little to sort things out. Ronald H. Brown, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said tonight, "It's a wide-open race. This was the starting gun, not the finish line."
Mr. Tsongas has seen New Hampshire transform his campaign from one accorded little attention, and even less chance of success, to one that is treated as a serious drive for the nomination. But he still needs to demonstrate that his candidacy can travel well.
He promoted his underdog victory as an affirmation of his message: a "bitter medicine" appeal to restore the economy, through such measures as a cut in the tax on capital gains to encourage investment. The polling of voters today suggested that much of his support was from people who wanted a candidate with specific ideas, as well as one who has shown strength and courage. The survey also showed that he had strength among upper-income voters, drawing half of those with incomes over $50,000.
But many Democrats still see his showing here as a reflection of his regional roots, his months of painstaking organizing, and the stumbles of the rest of the field.
Mr. Clinton managed to get some breathing space from the New Hampshire results, after three weeks when his standing suffered amid questions over whether he tried to avoid the draft, and accusations from a supermarket tabloid that he had a 12-year extramarital affair.
Mr. Clinton denied both charges, and voters in the polls today seemed to consider them unimportant. Only one in 20 said the assertions about Mr. Clinton's character were very important in their vote.
Still, in a troubling sign for the Democratic candidates, nearly a third of the voters in the Democratic primary said they wanted to see someone else in the race.
 
Decisions Made Late
 Emblematic of this confused Democratic race: 45 percent of the Democrats made their voting decisions in the past three days, or today, accoring to the surveys of those leaving voting places. This compares with 29 percent of the Republicans who decided during that time frame.
The poll was conducted by Voter Research and Surveys, an organization created in 1990 by ABC News, CBS News, CNN and NBC News.
The results are based on interviews with 1,918 voters in 60 randomly selected precincts who voted in the Democratic primary, and on 1,848 voters in 60 precincts who voted in the Republican primary. The findings for the full samples have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
As the results finally settled in tonight, the candidates reacted with a mixture of exhaustion and relief. Mr. Clinton, who finished several points ahead of what the final polls had predicted, seemed thrilled to have gotten out of New Hampshire in fighting shape.
He gave a preacherly speech, a mixture of pride and gratitude, telling a rally, "This has been a tough campaign, but at least I've proved I can take a punch." He asserted that the voters here had made him "the comeback kid" and said he looked forward to "taking this campaign across the country." Mr. Clinton is clearly hoping to use his financial and organizational edge for a long march to the nomination.
 
'Are You Listening?'
 Mr. Tsongas cast his victory as a triumph over Washington and the conventional wisdom: "Hello, Washington, this is New Hampshire calling. Are you listening?" He said the voters here were saying, "Just tell us the truth, tell us the truth."
Mr. Buchanan, at a wild rally tonight, promised to "take our party back from those that have walked away from us." While his audience chanted, "God bless America, God bless Pat," Mr. Buchanan called for recruits and said he would take his campaign on to Florida, Maryland, Georgia "and points beyond."
As the race moves to the South, Mr. Bush will also have to contend with David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader who mounting campaigns in several states in the region.
Mr. Duke, a former Louisiana state representative, is on the ballot in South Carolina, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Tennessee. His best chance of making an early showing may be in South Carolina, which has a March 7 primary and where he has made several campaign appearances.
 
No Rest for Tsongas
 For the Democrats, New Hampshire begins a wave of primaries and caucuses that will, by March 17, produce 55 percent of the delegates to the Democratic convention in July. The Maine caucuses will be held this Sunday, and Mr. Tsongas is probably the favorite there, given his regional roots and the bounce he will get out of New Hampshire. On Tuesday comes the primary in South Dakota, where both Midwesterners in the race, Mr. Kerrey and Mr. Harkin, are desperately looking for a lift.
But the next major struggle for the Democrats comes on March 3, when primaries or caucuses will be held in Colorado, Georgia, Idaho, Maryland, Minnesota, Utah and Washington. This is the day that will suggest whether Mr. Tsongas has national appeal that could help him generate more money and credibility before the daunting round of 11 primaries and caucuses to be held one week later, on March 10, Super Tuesday.
The Tsongas campaign says it is emphasizing Maryland, Colorado and Washington and is particularly hopeful of winning Maryland. "Maryland is wide open," said Nate Landow, the state Democratic chairman there.
Mr. Clinton is hoping for success on March 3 in Georgia, where he has the support of Gov. Zell Miller. The Arkansas Governor badly needs some victories to steady his candidacy and is counting on his native South to provide them. Like Mr. Tsongas, however, Mr. Clinton needs to show strength outside his region, and he will be counting on his superior resources to keep him in the mix almost everywhere.
There is a real possibility that March 3 could produce a muddle, with Mr. Tsongas showing strength in Maryland and Mr. Clinton in Georgia while Mr. Kerrey and Mr. Harkin pop up elsewhere. "We could have a very indecisive day," Mr. Landow said.

 CORRECTION:
A chart in some copies yesterday giving results of a poll of Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire misstated the response to one question. Among those who said they voted for Gov. Bill Clinton, 58 percent said that the economy and jobs were among the issues that mattered most in determining their vote.

HEADLINE: Hard Times in the Schools -- A Special Report;
In Classrooms, the Economy Is Teaching a Harsh Lesson

BYLINE: By SUSAN CHIRA

 BODY:
Hard times are reaching into the American classroom.
Just when politicians are calling for a revival in American education, the recession is leaving principals and teachers across the country with less money for more students. 
 The toll is uneven, and not all the cuts are dire. But reports are somber across the economic spectrum. Schools in the hardest-hit areas have no art, no music, no librarians and no counselors. Teachers comb rummage sales and attics for supplies. School districts stop running buses and hold Bingo nights to pay for sports programs.
"A year ago we received the nation's education goals and I was told to post them on my wall," said Jane Gaskell, principal of Pembroke Hill Elementary School in Pembroke, N.H., referring to the six ambitious education goals President Bush has said he wants achieved by the year 2000. "We're not even getting close. I read my education journals and hear about these innovative programs and I laugh and say, 'The band's playing on.' "
There are no up-to-date national figures on public school spending cuts, but interviews with experts on school finance, national education groups and principals of 27 schools in 13 states suggest that this year is bad and that next year will be worse.
The latest estimates available for spending on elementary and secondary education from the National Center on Education Statistics project a 5.8 percent increase by Federal, state and local governments for the school year that began this fall.
But the notion of an increase may be misleading because these estimates were made as the recession was just unfolding. In many cases, rising school enrollments, local reluctance to raise taxes and state fiscal problems have meant that schools actually have less money than before.
So far this year, 30 states have reported budget deficits or revenue shortfalls, according to Anthony Hutchison, a fiscal analyst for the National Conference of State Legislatures. States and towns pay 94 percent of all education costs. Although surveys show that most state legislatures had planned to increase spending on education this school year, Mr. Hutchison said he expected that the recession would pare those increases or force actual cuts in many cases before the end of this year. Rising school enrollments have meant that a small increase can actually be a cut. Even more than states, cities and towns appear to be cutting education spending as voters worried about the economy reject tax increases.
The worst-off schools are in the Northeast and California, according to Steven D. Gold, director of the Center for the Study of the States at the Rockefeller Institute of Government in Albany. In a survey conducted this December by the National Association of Elementary School Principals, 74 percent of the 650 principals who responded reported budget cuts. Forty percent of the principals said teachers had been let go. Nearly half the principals cut back music, art, and programs for gifted children; 80 percent have eliminated field trips.
Critics have long contended that money's role in education is overrated. It is clear that some school bureaucracies absorb too much money before it reaches the classroom; the National Center for Education Statistics has found that nearly 40 percent of money for education does not go directly to the classroom but is spent on administration, guidance counselors, transportation and other services.
But it is equally clear that in many places schools are hobbled. In rural Hancock County in eastern Tennessee, schools depend on fund raisers to buy all school supplies. In Belington, W.Va., teachers run booths at the local fair to raise money so that they can attend workshops. In Los Angeles, the Aragon Avenue School had to cut playground hours in a neighborhood where children have nowhere else to play.
Young as they are, children in these schools notice. "I think we're cheated out of a lot of things," said Cathleen Miles, a fourth-grader who is organizing a bake sale to raise money for Public School 243 in Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn, one of New York City's poorest neighborhoods. "We used to go to science class and learn about animals. We haven't got to a computer class yet this year, or a music class."
Here are three case studies of what budget cuts have meant to individual schools.
 
 
Mount Healthy, Ohio
A Leaking Roof And No Scissors
 When money got so tight that the kindergarten teacher had to scour garage sales for Lego sets and the nurse was cut back to once a week, the teachers at Rex Ralph Elementary School put the ad in The Wall Street Journal.
"Invest in America's Future," the headline read, inviting benefactors to adopt the school in Mount Healthy, a middle-income suburb of Cincinnati.
No one did.
So the eight leaks in the roof keep dripping, the copier and computer stay broken, the missing "F" volume in the school's only set of encyclopedias goes unreplaced, and teachers continue without a pay raise for a third year.
Times are bad in Mount Healthy, and over the last year and a half voters have rejected four requests for local tax increases to pay for education. The district now spends $4,376 per student, below the national average of $5,240.
State cuts are looming on top of local ones. The district's treasurer, Rebecca Brooks, said the state, which supplies much of Mount Healthy's education budget, held education aid below the inflation rate last year and will cut aid next year.
 
'The Worst I've Ever Seen'
 That means more trouble ahead for Rex Ralph Elementary, where the principal is already making do with one-quarter the money for supplies he had two and a half years ago. "This is my 24th year in education, and this is the worst I've ever seen it," said the principal, Clifford A. Strefelt, a tall, hearty man whose voice these days sounds permanently mournful.
The librarian is gone, and a school aide darts between the computer room and the library. The music teacher now spends half her day at the high school, so instead of music every day, the children have 35 minutes twice a week. Class sizes have risen from 23 a few years ago to nearly 30 now. Wanda Tucker, the school secretary, bought her own thermometer and bandages for the four days a week she doubles as school nurse.
In a country pledged to be the best in math and science by the year 2000, the students at Rex Ralph Elementary use patched-up science textbooks dating from 1981, have no beakers or hot plates for science experiments and saw their computer time cut in half, from four hours a week to two.
"They have nothing special -- no field trips, no paper, no equipment," said Karen Schneider, who praises the school but is nonetheless considering switching her two children to parochial schools. "Our athletic department is raising money through Bingo."
Many parents have rallied behind the school. But the campaign for local tax increases has divided the community, parents say, pitting neighbors who send their children to parochial school against those who chose public schools. "For what people spend on cable TV, we could finance the levy," said Gerry Gutfreund, a children's book writer whose daughter is in first grade at Rex Ralph Elementary.
The local Parent-Teacher Association has tried to fill the biggest gaps, buying a copying machine (now broken) and donating money for library books. But as much as the obvious cuts, teachers mourn the extra touches that they believe make the difference between excelling and just getting by.
Jan Brown has no scissors for her first graders. Catherine Thomas, a fourth-grade teacher, cannot afford the extra paper it takes for the packages of puzzles and games she used to create to help children learn math.
And Beverly Chrisanthus has had to abandon her cherished second-grade play because there is not enough paint, paper or staples for scenery or enough rehearsal time now that the school has to close one evening a week to trim heating and electricity bills.
"I'm drained some days," Mrs. Chrisanthus said. "I wish someone could come in and see how my day starts, with tears, lost money, 'Mom's mad at me' -- then we're supposed to sit down and train these little minds to be the best at math in the world."
Sitting in the library, a group of sixth graders reeled off a list of problems: Old books, big classes, outdated maps, no field trips, no student council.
"Money's more important than us," said Sadie Gaston. "We're left out," said Michael Hill.
 
Brooklyn
A Proud Tradition Lost to Cutbacks
 Once, Joyce Washington saw her school as a testament to the promise of urban education. Now it speaks more eloquently of loss.
Mrs. Washington is principal of the Weeksville School in the heart of Bedford-Stuyvesant, one of New York City's poorest and most crime-ravaged neighborhoods, which nonetheless boasts a proud history as a free black community and a stop on the Underground Railroad for escaping slaves.
The Brooklyn school built much of its curriculum on that history and created a small museum filled with mementos from Weeksville's past. With the help of the Bank Street College of Education, the school retrained teachers, published student writing, and adopted the Follow Through program, designed to insure that the gains of the Head Start preschool program did not fade once children entered elementary school. The Weeksville School, also known as P.S. 243, was chosen as a national model, and helped develop similar programs at 100 other schools.
But after 23 years, the programs are gone.
Mrs. Washington's school has a high percentage of foster children, scarred by abusive or drug-using parents and then bounced from one foster placement to another. The students are familiar with violence. One parent, Marcella Mobley, tells of hitting the ground the other day across the street from the school, unable to reach her son as shots rang out.
A previous cut eliminated the social worker who used to help children, families and teachers cope with these horrors. And with the end of the Follow Through program this fall, the Weeksville School lost a teacher trainer, a neighborhood worker who got parents involved, extra money for books and field trips, and a rich collaboration with Bank Street that sought to recreate a public school along the lines of the institution's nationally renowned private one.
On top of those cuts came others forced by the recession's blows to New York's economy. New York City spends $5,915 on each elementary school child, above the national average, and $16,746 for children in need of special education. The city had to trim school budgets by less than 1 percent this fall, but much deeper cuts are expected next year.
Now a nurse gets to the Weeksville School just once a month. There is no longer a special science teacher to set up a room that children vividly recall as full of animals and science projects. With three school aides gone, it is hard to control children in the lunchroom. Class sizes range between 30 and 35 because the school lost three teachers.
Children are not being taught in closets here. Plants still line many classrooms, and on bright days the sun streams through, creating an aura of cheer. But the contrast between what was and what is rankles parents, teachers and students. For a school with high ambitions, making do is not good enough.
"We'd like to have extra math and science labs, and we do not have access to things like that," said Elmen Meggs, whose grandchildren attend the school and who used to work with the Follow Through program as a parent coordinator. "We know that science and math are important for our children."
 
Difficult Choices
 Maurice Rosenthal used to spend three periods a day with gifted math students. But in one example of the difficult choices posed by cuts, he is now assigned full time to the slowest math students. By giving up his own preparation periods, he manages to see the gifted students twice a week.
"They could use much more than that," he said. "People don't see the beauty of a child who says, 'I really solved this problem."'
The school's students are acutely aware of what they are missing. Their conversation is peppered with lists of what they had last year: a full-time science teacher, a creative writing teacher, a school store, smaller classes, clean bathrooms.
"We're just overwhelmed," said Martha Smith, whose class of 32 sixth graders cannot take science books home at night because there are not enough to go around. "We don't have the supplies we need. We do a lot of group activities in class, and it's hard to keep it under control. When everyone is here, we don't have enough seats." So far this year, Ms. Smith has already spent $400 of her own money to buy supplies such as paper or chalk.
Her class has been thinking about why so much has changed. "Maybe they think we're not worth it," said Bryant Adderley.
 
Montebello, Calif.
Used to Plenty, Shocked by Cuts
 When Vivian Hoorn walked into her classroom this fall, she could not believe what she saw: 45 children staring back at her.
"I thought, 'Surely they will take half these children away,' " she said.
But the children were not going anywhere. Budget cuts have pushed class sizes near 40 at Montebello Intermediate School, a school for fifth to eighth graders just east of Los Angeles.
Ms. Hoorn's class shrank to 38 after several children moved out of the district. She and other teachers are trying to continue the creative teaching methods that have won their school praise in the past. But teachers and students say there is a price.
"You're too stuffed in," said Danny Nunez, as he sat in his sixth-grade class of 42 students. "You can't get as much attention as you did last year," said Julie Franco. "There are so many kids the teacher has to give to," said Jeannette Sanchez.
The Montebello school district, struggling with state budget cuts and its own fiscal problems, had to slash spending by 20 percent this fall and may need to cut an additional 10 percent next year. California, especially hard-hit by this recession, has cut education spending by 12 percent after inflation in the past three years, according to Roger Rasmussen, director of the independent analysis unit of the Los Angeles Unified School District.
Like many other school districts in a state that experienced explosive growth in the 1980's, Montebello drew up its budgets and negotiated multi-year raises with teachers expecting that the good times would roll on. When the recession struck, the district was not prepared for the decline in state aid and is now cutting deeply, according to Montebello's acting superintendent, Darline Robles.
The district now spends about $4,000 per student, below the national average. Montebello's overwhelmingly Hispanic students come from six towns that range from very poor to affluent.
The cuts have jolted Montebello Intermediate, which belonged to a district once known for lavishing moeny on its schools. Class sizes soared because the school lost 12 of 58 teachers, including several bilingual teachers whom the principal, Judith L. Petersen, ranked among her best. Clerical and custodial help was cut. A special art program that took children to local museums had to go.
To Ms. Petersen, who was a student at Montebello in the prosperous 1950's, the cuts are particularly frustrating because she believes that schools now must aim higher than in the past, when many teachers assumed less talented children would drop out.
"We're keeping kids in schools that when I went to school we didn't manage to keep," she said. "It really breaks my heart to lose our funding when I honestly believe we are so close to making it happen."
These days at Montebello, truancy is up because the lone remaining attendance officer, Virginia Garcia, is so overrun keeping track of 1,700 students, and the students are betting their parents will not find out they have played hooky.
Art Revueltas, an assistant principal, dumped an envelope on his desk, and out spilled a gun, several bullets, and a pile of switchblades. So far this year, he has seen three students who told him they had tried to kill themselves, and held up their scarred wrists to prove it.
"These things still go on, and we have fewer people to deal with them," he said. "We have said we can handle all this if you just give us more money. The public is saying that we still want you to do that, but we are going to give you less. Maybe the social contract we've been living under has been cancelled."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Republicans;
BUSH CONSIDERING A SHIFT IN TACTICS TO FIGHT BUCHANAN

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 19

 BODY:
Despite the discontent evident in the New Hampshire primary results, the White House and the Bush campaign plan no changes in the economic policies of President Bush and focused today on the tactical question of how hard to attack his challenger, Patrick J. Buchanan.
Although Mr. Bush himself still seemed to waver over how far he should go in that direction, the President began his assault on Mr. Buchanan by citing quotations his aides have amassed from the columnist's prolific writings to suggest that Mr. Buchanan wants to make Social Security a voluntary system. 
 Bush aides acknowledged that the President's efforts to sell his economic program had fallen flat in New Hampshire. Mr. Bush's margin of victory over Mr. Buchanan was smaller than the Bush campaign had hoped, although it was larger than early projections from the polling of voters had indicated. Those early figures left the impression that Mr. Bush had barely defeated his rival.
 
Official Results of Vote
 Official results today from the New Hampshire Secretary of State showed that Mr. Bush received 53 percent of the vote and Mr. Buchanan 37 percent, and that 2 percent went to minor candidates and 8 percent to Democratic Presidential contenders whose names were written in on the Republican ballot as a protest. The write-ins were not counted on primary night. Counting only Bush and Buchanan votes, the President defeated Mr. Buchanan by 59 percent to 41 percent.
The results alarmed the White House, but Administration and campaign officials argued that the proper response was to fine-tune and sharpen their political message, and not to make basic policy changes advocated by some Republicans.
For the Democrats, New Hampshire provided Paul E. Tsongas and Bill Clinton with new credibility and set the stage for a tough nomination struggle, with the candidates forced to spread out and appeal to voters from a broader spectrum. [Page A21.]
 
Faith in Economy
 Robert M. Teeter, Mr. Bush's campaign chairman, said, "I'm convinced and the President is convinced that the economy is going to get better in the fall."
This view received some support today from Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, who said he saw "stirrings" of an economic recovery, and from figures showing that in January, new-home construction reached its briskest pace since May 1990.
But some disgruntled party regulars complained that Mr. Bush needed an overhaul of both his message and his policies. The campaign's self-inspection, some of which was conducted in public by Mr. Bush himself, reflected broad concerns within the Republican Party about why the President and his high-powered campaign team had stumbled so badly in New Hampshire.
Republican strategists and campaign officials said Mr. Bush had to go beyond the tactical concern of blunting Mr. Buchanan and find his own voice as the primary campaigns broaden into the South, then the West and then the Midwest, and then for the general election.
Mr. Bush's effort in New Hampshire to cater to the right wing of the party, salting his essentially moderate policies with conservative social messages and holding his fire to avoid a party rift, clearly did not work, strategists said. They said it would be of even less use as he tried to appeal to a broader section of the party and to conservative Democrats as the campaign goes on.
The President's own lackluster performance on the stump in New Hampshire also raised questions about the wisdom of basing the campaign's plans on a barnstorming tour of the South that will keep Mr. Bush on the road for most of the next three weeks.
 
Bush's Aloof Stance
 Clearly vexed at Mr. Buchanan's successes in New Hampshire and under pressure from Republican leaders to abandon the aloof stance toward his challenger that had cost him votes there, Mr. Bush today acknowledged that he had allowed himself to "lay back and get hammered" without defending himself.
Mr. Bush told reporters during a visit to Tennessee, one of 11 states that will hold primaries on March 10, Super Tuesday, that he was eager to "roll up my sleeves and go after" his Republican and Democratic adversaries.
But he seemed uncertain about how aggressive he was prepared to be to accomplish his current strategic objectives: to lock up the Republican nomination by early May and then to prevent Mr. Buchanan from hanging on long enough to go to the June 2 California primary, where the Bush campaign fears a nomination struggle would hurt Mr. Bush next November in a hard-to-win state.
"We might have to define the opponent," Mr. Bush said, referring to him by name -- as "Pat" -- for the first time in the campaign and using a common political euphemism for attacking another candidate. "I've been very kind and gentle," Mr. Bush said. "I'll still be kind and I'm now debating how gentle to be."
One issue that continued to vex the Bush camp was Mr. Buchanan's clear success in New Hampshire with commercials that accused Mr. Bush of abandoning a $500 increase in the tax exemption for children because he did not include it among the seven most urgent measures that he wants passed by March 20.
But Administration and Congressional officials said that the White House did not plan to revise its seven-point list, worked out after the State of the Union Message, to include the proposal, or to make any other major shift in economic policy.
"If the message didn't get through, we've got to articulate it better, but fundamentally the message is the same," a top campaign official said today. "It's that he does understand, he had the message long before New Hampshire, that we've got some economic problems in the country that are severe."
Bush aides contend that voters were angrier in New Hampshire because its economic situation was especially bad and that voter dissatisfaction in general is not with Mr. Bush personally, but with the Federal Government as a whole.
"I think people feel that the economy is poised for recovery," Mr. Bush said.
 
'The Gloves Are Off'
 Campaign officials said today Mr. Bush's spokesmen would have a freer hand in criticizing Mr. Buchanan. "I think it's fair to say that the gloves are off," said Charles Black, senior adviser to the Bush campaign.
He added: "Pat made a good showing and he deserves attention, but we know from a lot of history that heavy negatives, not responded to, cost you a lot of votes, and we won't let him get away with that again. We will be discussing some of the issues he's interested in, such as isolationism and protectionism."
A senior Bush campaign official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, focused on Mr. Buchanan's opposition to the war in the Persian Gulf.
"If he wants to debate whether or not the war was a good idea, if he wants to debate whether going into Kuwait or not was a good idea and having Desert Storm, which he didn't support, was a good idea, fine," he said. "We'll debate that with him."
Mr. Bush himself made some indirect swipes at Mr. Buchanan. Asked by reporters in Knoxville, Tenn., how he would define the differences between himself and his challenger, Mr. Bush pushed one of the hottest political buttons there is: Social Security.
"Well, I don't think Social Security ought to be voluntary," Mr. Bush said. "That's the Bush position."
Asked about Mr. Bush's remark, Mr. Buchanan said, "I wouldn't touch Social Security." Asked whether he had ever advocated changing Social Security, he said: "I don't know what I wrote 27 years ago. They are probably digging through the files."
The Bush campaign said the reference came from a 1983 syndicated column in which Mr. Buchanan wrote: "Why not make Social Security voluntary? For black Americans and all Americans. Why not allow young black and white workers to opt out, on condition that they set aside -- in Individual Retirement Accounts -- amounts equal to what they would have given in to Social Security?"
 
How Hard to Fight
 But when it came to attacking Mr. Buchanan directly, Mr. Bush pulled his punches today. Officials were still debating how aggressive Mr. Bush should be, as well as whether to use negative television commercials like one that was prepared for New Hamsphire but never broadcast.
In New Hampshire, Mr. Bush held his fire out of fear of dividing the party. But Mr. Black suggested that the campaign was willing to take that risk for the short-term goal of eliminating Mr. Buchanan. "We'll get the party together," he said. "It just might take us a little longer."

HEADLINE: FED CHIEF UPBEAT ON THE ECONOMY

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 19

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, today gave his most optimistic assessment in months of the economy's near-term prospects, but he said the signs of an upturn could still peter out.
Testifying before a House subcommittee, Mr. Greenspan said that "we are beginning to see stirrings" of a recovery as he pointed in particular to a pickup in retail sales and in home building, including a 5.5 percent jump in construction of new homes in January that was announced today. [Page D1.] 
 He also said, as he has in other recent testimony, that an economic recovery should take hold in the second quarter.
 
Stresses Lower Inflation
 With his testimony coming in the politically charged atmosphere after the New Hampshire primary, Mr. Greenspan's heavily hedged "on the one hand, on the other hand" testimony seemed to take special pains to avoid partisanship. But his forecast of a recovery in the second quarter, however circumscribed, would seem to reassure White House strategists worried about President Bush's poor showing in the primary because of the economy.
With an eye to the bond markets, which have pushed interest rates up in recent days partly on concern that economic growth could feed inflation, he emphasized that inflation was falling, adding that the nation would soon "have attained the lowest rates of inflation in a generation."
The Labor Department today, in fact, said that consumer prices last month rose only a tenth of 1 percent. Bond prices rallied and interest rates fell in response to that report and to Mr. Greenspan's remarks.
Analysts said that the recent signs of a pickup in economic growth that Mr. Greenspan mentioned today indicated that the Fed was not likely to cut interest rates further anytime soon to stimulate the economy.
Even so, Mr. Greenspan said that the central bank was closely monitoring the economy. He has said several times in recent weeks that the Fed would ease monetary policy further if the economy continues to stall.
Mr. Greenspan said that although the nation's industrial production dropped in January, the Fed's data show an end to that decline in February, as well as improvements in new orders and inventory backlogs.
In addition to the gain in housing construction reported today, which pushed new-home building to its highest level since the middle of 1990, the Government last week reported an increase of six-tenths of a percent in retail sales in January.
 
Could 'Peter Out'
 Saying he was "somewhat more optimistic" about an upturn than he was a few weeks ago, the Fed chairman said: "I don't wish to overemphasize it. It's a series of weeks, and it could just as easily peter out as indeed the much more vigorous recovery of last spring petered out."
He acknowledged that he was wrong to forecast six months ago that the recovery that began last spring would continue. The Fed and most economists were surprised when the modest recovery stalled, largely because of a fall-off in consumer confidence and a new buildup in inventories.
Looking to the nation's long-term prospects, Mr. Greenspan pointedly criticized the White House and Congress for not doing enough to reduce the Federal budget deficit. He said that for the first time in years, the Administration's forecasts did not see the budget reaching a surplus within five years. He noted that current estimates call for a $200 billion Federal deficit in 1996.
The Fed chairman said these levels "are higher than we should be willing to accept" and added that "the large stocks of Federal debt" have "adversely affected our economic prospects by putting upward pressure on real interest rates and thus stunting the growth of the capital stock, on which our future incomes depend."
 
Debts Are the Drag
 In discussing why the economy has not picked up faster, Mr. Greenspan said the main force holding back recovery was that households and businesses were still struggling to reduce the huge debt loads they acquired during the 1980's. Only when households feel they have reduced their debt sufficiently, for instance by refinancing mortgages at lower interest rates, will spending take off again, he said.
"What we do not know," he said, "is how far the adjustment process for balance sheets must proceed prior to the renewal of the normal forces of economic activity."
Making the Federal Reserve's semiannual presentation on monetary policy and the economy before the House Subcommittee on Domestic Monetary Policy, Mr. Greenspan said the Fed believed the nation's economy would grow by 1.75 percent to 2.5 percent this year. The White House has forecast 2.2 percent growth. He said the jobless rate, currently 7.1 percent, would edge down this year to between 6.75 and 7 percent, and that core inflation would decline this year, with inflation registering between 3 and 3.5 percent. That compares with 3 percent inflation in 1991 when weak oil prices pulled down the rate.
As he has before, Mr. Greenspan said he supported President Bush's proposals to reduce the capital gains tax and to restore certain tax breaks for the real estate industry to help it climb off the floor. In the past he has warned against other tax cut proposals promoted as providing short-term stimulus, saying they might push up the deficit.
 
Questions from Schumer
 When Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, asked him whether raising taxes for one portion of the population and lowering them for another would have a stimulative or negative effect, Mr. Greenspan responded that "most economists would say its effect would be negligible."
Mr. Greenspan said the Fed's announcement Tuesday that it was reducing banks' reserve requirements should help increase their profits and ultimately encourage them to lend more to help lift the economy. The decision to cut reserves on checking and other transaction accounts will allow banks to invest some $8 billion to $9 billion that was not earning income. This move is expected to increase bank profits by about $400 million a year, analysts said.
Mr. Greenspan disclosed that the central bank had voted to reaffirm the 1992 monetary growth targets it had tentatively decided on last July. He said this year's growth target for M-2, a broad definition of money, was between 2.5 percent and 6.5 percent, the same range as last year.
Representative Schumer asked the Fed chairman why he had said, "There are reasons to believe that business activity should pick up," when the official text of his speech said, "There are reasons to believe that business activity will pick up."
Mr. Greenspan said that when he read the text of his speech this morning: "I said to myself that this is an inappropriate statement. 'Will' presupposed necessity. And in that type of context the appropriate word is 'should' so I edited it."

It began as a low whisper among aides to Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d. But as the plane taking them to Moscow at the close of Mr. Baker's grueling tour of former Soviet republics took off, the whispers grew into a vigorous chant: "Penta, Penta, Penta, Penta."
The Penta is the deluxe German-run hotel in Moscow where Mr. Baker always stays. After a week of sleeping often two or three to a room in seedy, run-down former Communist Party guest houses in the wilds of Ashkhabad and Dushanbe, Mr. Baker's aides were desperate for the down comforters, hot water and efficiency of the Penta. It was the first time any of them could recall longing to get to Moscow. 
 But few expressed regrets about being on Mr. Baker's whistlestop run through Moldova, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and the Russian hinterland, for it provided a broad look at life in the former Soviet empire.
The trip was symbolized by the buttons in the elevator of the October Hotel in Yekaterinburg, formerly known as Sverdlovsk, in the eastern foothills of the Ural Mountains in Russia. The buttons were listed as follows: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 2.
Evidently, the elevator technicians forgot about the second floor and decided to add the button for it later. And that was pretty much how Mr. Baker found life on the road from Kishinev to Samarkand: haphazard and at times incomprehensible, very often pleasing to the eye from afar, but just a little bit off kilter upon closer inspection.
There was a pool table in Mr. Baker's guest house in Tashkent, but four balls were missing, including the cue ball. There was a discotheque in the guest house in Baku, Azerbaijan: a man-made grotto with concrete stalactites dripping from the ceiling and a bizarre music video of alleged Armenian atrocities in the contested enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh.
There were guest houses with no baths and guest houses with no showers. And there was the guest house in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, with no shower or bath -- only a sink with a shower attachment where the faucet belonged. People were showering on their knees.
The Dushanbe hotel also had no heat in half the rooms. On one side of the hall people were sleeping in their overcoats, but on the other side the rooms were so overheated that people were sleeping with their doors open. It was hard to believe that this was where privileged Communist Party officials once came to relax.
The five-star award, though, definitely went to the Seabaco Hotel in Kishinev, Moldova, which offered a 24-hour pedicure service, which several reporters traveling with Mr. Baker sampled at 2:00 A.M. The reporters were up because the hotel front desk had chosen that hour to call the rooms of the press contingent to ask them all to come downstairs to pay their room bills.
 
Phone Deregulation
 Nothing was more diverse than the prices, as some republics seem to have quickly jumped on the free-market bandwagon and others appear not to have caught on to even the rudiments of capitalism. In Yekaterinburg, the hotel charged 36 rubles, or 3.6 cents, per minute for an international direct-dial phone call to the United States. In Samarkand, Uzbekistan, the managers of the former Communist Party guest house informed reporters that an international phone call would cost $26 a minute -- cash only, please. After reporters shouted in protest, the price was reduced to $7 a minute. Why $7? Why $26? No one could explain.
Food, even fresh fruit, seemed to be available everywhere from Armenia to Uzbekistan, but at prices far beyond anything affordable to the average worker. In Armenia, only a few meager pears and grapes were on sale in the market, but in Uzbekistan, the market appeared to be rich with fruit and vegetables.
The real shortages everywhere are not of food but of medicines, American officials say. The Soviet Union used to import most of its disposable medical supplies -- from syringes to aspirin to antibiotics -- from its former Eastern European satellites. Now they are demanding hard currency and the commonwealth governments simply cannot pay.
In the barter market in Yekaterinburg, where people come each day to swap anything for anything, reporters found a man holding up a flimsy piece of cardboard upon which were displayed a few adhesive bandages, some packets of aspirin and several unidentifiable medical items. He was apparently bartering them for food.
 
The Czar's Skull
 With the collapse of the Soviet Union, little signs of a monarchist revival are beginning to appear. In Yekaterinburg, Mr. Baker was taken to the site of the house, now marked with a simple wooden cross and a few stones, where the last czar, Nicholas II, and his family were held and later killed by the Bolsheviks in 1918.
A freelance monarchist in a floppy fur hat tends the site and for no charge will describe the killing of "those whom God had chosen to lead Russia." Anyone who stands in the cold to listen to his lecture is rewarded with a free picture of the Czar's son, Aleksei.
The governor of the Yekaterinburg district, which local officials described as a hotbed of monarchism, took Mr. Baker to a pathology lab to examine the skulls and bones that local authorities believe are the remains of the Czar's family. Their bodies had had acid poured on them before being buried in a forest outside the city, but 10 years ago local monarchists, using acid tests on the soil, discovered what they believe were the family remains.
Mr. Baker described being shown what is believed to be the head of Czar Nicholas II with its gold teeth still in place. Others had visible bullet holes through their skulls, he said. In the first known joint venture between the United States and local monarchists, Mr. Baker offered to send American forensic experts to Yekaterinburg to help them test conclusively whether the bones are those of the last czar.
 
Cable-Ready Republics
 In Baku, Azerbaijan, one of President Ayaz N. Mutalibov's bodyguards was standing outside his doorway when a horde of American reporters arrived for a news conference. The mustachioed Azerbaijani guard just stood there, arms folded across his chest, shaking his head back and forth as if to say, "This rabble is not entering the President's office." But after a standoff of about five seconds, he was literally stampeded by the reporters.
It seemed to symbolize the way in which some of these newly independent states were overwhelmed by their first real encounter with the Western press. At each stop, republic leaders would share a news conference with Mr. Baker. For most of these leaders it was their first Western-style grilling.
Some, like Rakhman N. Nabaiyev of Tajikistan, found it torture. He summarily cut off the news conference after the second question, one about Iran's influence in his republic. Mr. Nabaiyev promised the reporters traveling with Mr. Baker that before the Secretary departed, "Of course, we will have the possibility of meeting you once more." But he was never seen again.
Nevertheless, usually one of the first questions Mr. Baker got from all these Central Asian leaders was: "How do I get CNN?" The Central Asians were obsessed with being able to get their news from sources independent of Moscow. Having CNN, they explained, was the symbol of such independence, as well as a real membership card in the club of Western states.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: New Hampshire;
Democratic Candidates' Next Three Weeks: a Scramble Around America

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEDFORD, N.H., Feb. 19

 BODY:
The race for the Democratic nomination rolled out of New Hampshire today with a newly credible Paul E. Tsongas, a revived Bill Clinton and a far more complicated course ahead, with primaries and caucuses in 25 states over the next three weeks.
Mr. Tsongas, a former Senator from Massachusetts, got the opportunity to build a national campaign on his New Hampshire victory and demonstrate that he can carry his message beyond his region. Declaring that he had "great potential to move," he began a trip to Maryland, New York, South Dakota, Maine and Georgia, a scramble emblematic of the days to come, and the challenge he faces in quickly and substantially expanding his campaign. 
 New Hampshire gave Governor Clinton of Arkansas a second chance, after two weeks of harrowing publicity over allegations about marital infidelity and his draft record. A variety of Democrats also agreed that Mr. Clinton's performance in the primary freezes talk of new candidates entering the race any time soon. Those signals came from several party members including Speaker of the House Thomas S. Foley, who told reporters, "I personally don't expect to see it."
 
A Long, Tough Struggle Ahead
 Beyond that, New Hampshire simply set the stage for a long, tough struggle for the nomination, when the candidates will have to spread out, target their opportunities, appeal to voters from across a much broader spectrum, and rely to a much greater extent on money and news media than they did in the confines of this tiny state.
"We'll know a lot more by mid-March," said Ronald H. Brown, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee. Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus and a supporter of Mr. Clinton, said, "Clinton did well enough to be in a holding pattern and not be written off, and Tsongas did well enough to make him a real factor."
Most Democrats look to March 3 for the next sorting out, when primaries and caucuses will be held in Colorado, Georgia, Idaho, Maryland, Minnesota, Utah and Washington. An additional 11 states will have contests a week later, on March 10. First, however, come the Maine caucuses on Sunday and South Dakota primary on Tuesday.
 
Mixed Verdicts
 The verdicts were less clear for the rest of the field, which finished well behind Mr. Tsongas and Mr. Clinton. The two Midwesterners in the race, Senators Tom Harkin of Iowa and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, will be hustling for a victory in the South Dakota primary. Mr. Kerrey acknowledged today that he needed to "do very well" in South Dakota to stay in the race, but felt that he was "hitting my stride" as a candidate.
Mr. Harkin said he also hoped to "pick up steam" in South Dakota and indicated he planned to escalate his already aggressive attacks. Referring to Mr. Clinton, the Iowa Democrat asserted, "I'm going to start talking about the Arkansas mirage. If that's the way he runs Arkansas, God help us if he ever gets to the Presidency."
Former Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California did better than most of the polls here had predicted, finishing in the neighborhood of Mr. Kerrey and Mr. Harkin.
The final results in New Hampshire showed Mr. Tsongas with 33 percent, Mr. Clinton with 25 percent, Mr. Kerrey with 11 percent, Mr. Harkin with 10 percent, Mr. Brown with 8 percent, and the write-in effort for Gov. Mario M. Cuomo at 4 percent.
 
Splitting Delegates
 Both Mr. Tsongas and Mr. Clinton emerged from New Hampshire with 9 delegates each. None of the other candidates cracked the 15 percent threshold that, under party rules, is required to qualify for delegates. Because of the Democratic rules apportioning delegates based on Congressional districts, both Mr. Tsongas and Mr. Clinton ended up with the same number of delegates even though their overall vote totals differed.
Surveys of voters leaving the polling place showed that Mr. Tsongas did particularly well among the most educated voters, getting 47 percent of those who had more than a college education. He also got four in 10 of those with income over $75,000, while three in 10 from that group went for Mr. Clinton.
The polling data also showed that Mr. Tsongas ran well among those voters who said that a candidate having specific ideas was important to them; 43 percent of that group went for Mr. Tsongas, and 22 percent for Mr. Clinton.
Mr. Tsongas predicted today that he and Mr. Clinton would, at some point, "go head to head on economic issues." Mr. Tsongas cites his economic proposals as basic truth-telling and a bold challenge to Democratic orthodoxy; he rejects a tax cut for the middle class and endorses a cut in the tax on capital gains to encourage investment. How well that will play among Democratic primary voters around the country, some analysts said, is an open question.
 
Chilly Reception Predicted
 Stan Greenberg, Mr. Clinton's polltaker, asserted, "This is an ecnomic plan that I don't think many Democrats will warm to."
The candidates are still making decisions on how to direct their resources in the coming weeks, although Mr. Tsongas has clearly targeted Maryland and Mr. Clinton will focus on Georgia. Mr. Greenberg said the Clinton campaign recognizes it needs to do well both inside and outside the South. "This is not going to be a bunker campaign," he said.
Money will be critical in the weeks to come. Rahm Emmanuel, Mr. Clinton's finance director, said the campaign will have raised $7 million by the end of February, adding, "We had always raised money and garnered resources based on a long-term strategy. Our worst day is Paul Tsonga's best day in terms of money."
A spokesman for Mr. Tsongas declined to furnish fundraising totals, but said that in the wake of the New Hampshire victory, the money was beginning to flow in.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: White House;
Bush Supporters Try to Figure Out How Their Campaign Went Wrong

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEDFORD, N.H., Feb. 19

 BODY:
Last week, President Bush's strategists here made a television commercial featuring a retired state police major, who recalled that when Mr. Bush was making the decision to send American troops to the Persian Gulf, "Pat Buchanan stood with Teddy Kennedy, Alan Cranston and the liberal Democrats, and said our boys couldn't fight."
Arguing first that negative advertising was un-Presidential, then that the ad was too late, the White House refused to put it on the air, 
 The decision not to "go negative," said a ranking official of the Bush campaign here, was one of two mistakes that together cost Mr. Bush his chance to knock Patrick J. Buchanan out of the race, or at least slow him down. The other mistake, the official said, was the President's failure to include his proposal for a $500 middle-class tax benefit, a popular feature of his State of the Union message, in the tax bill he sent to Congress.
 
11 Points Lost?
 One local strategist, who spoke on condition that he not be named, said the campaign's private polls, as well as some aspects of polls taken for news organizations, convinced him that Mr. Bush lost 11 percentage points as a result of the missteps. Had the President added those 11 points to his total, he would have defeated Mr. Buchanan among voters who chose those two candidates by 70 percent to 30 percent, the kind of landslide that would surely have deflated the Buchanan campaign.
In a telephone interview, Senator Warren B. Rudman of New Hampshire agreed that the President had made serious errors, including failing to send moderate Republicans like Senators Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas and Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico to the state. But even if he had done everything exactly right, Mr. Rudman argued, Mr. Bush would still have had trouble gaining a two-to-one victory in a state where he has never been terribly popular and where the economy has been devastated.
Mr. Bush's showing here might have been even worse had the White House, warned of budding disaster at midday, not ordered a redoubled effort to get Bush supporters to the voting booths. According to a senior Republican here, the Bush camp learned from news reporters that polls of people who had voted Tuesday morning showed them splitting almost evenly, with women much more pro-Bush than men. Ron Kaufman, the White House political director, then ordered a major telephone effort to insure that women cast ballots.
 
'Enormous Second Hurdle'
 For all of Mr. Buchanan's success here, he acknowledged this morning that with 13 primaries scheduled in the next three weeks, he faced a daunting prospect -- "an enormous second hurdle to overcome, even higher than the first one." His problems are complicated by his lack of a convenient place to challenge the President before Georgia votes on March 3.
The plan had been to compete in South Dakota, which votes on Tuesday, but the Bush forces, Mr. Buchanan asserted, "successfully kept us off the ballot there."
Buchanan aides said he had no plans to mount major campaigns in Maryland, which also votes on March 3, or in the Colorado primary and Washington caucuses that same day, although he intends to visit Colorado next week.
 
South Toward Georgia
 That makes Georgia crucial. The Republican party there has traditionally been a country-club party, to use the local phrase, meaning that it has been dominated by affluent white suburbanites. But election rules in the state permit anyone to ask for a Republican ballot and Mr. Buchanan will no doubt try to appeal to conservative Democrats as well as Republicans.
If Georgia goes well, and state party officials say the challenger could easily pull a third of the vote or more, Mr. Buchanan hopes his protectionist views will prove popular with textile workers in South Carolina, which is to vote on March 7.
After that, Mr. Buchanan has laid plans for a major effort on March 10, Super Tuesday, when eight Republican primaries are scheduled. According to his strategists, he will contest the primaries in Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Tennessee on that day, and will take the President on as well in a number of the Congressional districts in both Florida and Texas.
How many districts will depend on how much money he can raise, because only television can take his message into the dozens of major cities and hundreds of small towns that form the political target for Super Tuesday.
According to campaign officials, Mr. Buchanan has only $150,000 to $200,000 in cash on hand, having spent $1.5 million on television alone during his 45-day campaign in New Hampshire. But a direct-mail solicitation went out on Monday to 40,000 Buchanan supporters, and the campaign hopes it will bring in $250,000. Two more mailings to 300,000 people will be sent out over the next week, and the campaign said that it hoped to get $1 million in Federal matching funds on March 2.
 
'Guerrilla Operation'
 In their post-mortems, New Hampshire Republicans expressed admiration for Mr. Buchanan's insurgent campaign, which one of them called "the best guerrilla operation since the Vietcong." But there was endless criticism of the Bush campaign, too, covering every point from the quality of the television commercials, which were described as bland and routine, to the amount of time the President spent in the state, to the decision to use an out-of-state telephone bank.
Gov. Judd Gregg, the chairman of the Bush campaign in New Hampshire, declined comment on the strains between the Washington staff and those in the state.
"I got the feeling that the White House was willing to take whatever hit they got in this state and move on," said a veteran of several Presidential primaries in the state. "They said they didn't want to go after Buchanan because it would upset the conservatives they'd need later."
Another Republican active in the Bush campaign here commented, "If the mission was to win big, they certainly didn't show it. You have to have a clear message in these things, and they were on cruise control, as if they thought that Bush was defined forever politically by Desert Storm."
 
Persian Gulf Mattered Little
 In fact, with the President's television commercials touching only lightly on the subject, exit polls showed that only 7 percent of primary voters named the Persian Gulf war as one of the issues that mattered most in deciding how they voted. Of those, 95 percent cast their vote for Mr. Bush.
On the economy and jobs, which not surprisingly mattered a lot to a lot of voters, there was no significant difference. But the President's attempts on his first trip here and in his early commercials to convince New Hampshire voters that he had not forgotten them apparently failed. Those voters who said choosing someone "who cares about people like me" mattered a lot to them, 13 percent of the total, split 70-30 for Mr. Buchanan.
Mr. Buchanan also pulled a majority of those who said their family situation was worse than 10 years ago and a majority of those who thought the national economy was declining.
There was support in the poll as well for the Bush lieutenants here who argued that the President's failure to push for the $500 exemption, which Mr. Buchanan attacked in advertisements during the final weekend, had been costly. Of those voters who decided in the last week, Mr. Buchanan got 56 percent, it showed, and of those who made up their minds in the last three days, he got 58 percent.

HEADLINE: Japanese Slain In Boston Hotel, Adding to Fears

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, Feb. 19

 BODY:
The president of a Japanese university, here to sign an exchange agreement with the University of Massachusetts in Boston, was shot and killed in his hotel room on Tuesday evening, an act likely to feed stereotypes in Japan about the prevalence of crime in America.
Iwao Matsuda, the 72-year-old president of Chukyo University in Nagoya, was shot in the back after a man with a bandana over his face forced his way into the visitor's 16th-floor room in the elegant Westin Hotel, the police said. 
 While Mr. Matsuda struggled with the masked intruder, his wife, Akiko, ran into the hallway and then heard a shot, said Joseph Saia, Boston's superintendent of police.
 
Nothing Taken From Room
 Mr. Saia said that while robbery might have been a motive, nothing had been taken from the room. The suspect escaped.
News of Mr. Matsuda's killing was prominently reported in many Japanese newspapers and television newscasts.
"I don't think this incident will have any political impact on Japan's relations with America," said Yoichi Kawakami, the New York bureau chief for Asahi Shimbun, one of Japan's three national daily papers.
"But, I am sorry to say, this is because Japanese already know America is a very dangerous place to stay, especially the big cities," Mr. Kawakami said in a telephone interview. "So the Japanese people will feel this is one more example of what happens in America."
 
'A Particularly Bad Time'
 Mr. Matsuda's slaying comes at an especially sensitive time in America's relations with Japan, shortly after President Bush's controversial trip to Tokyo and amid rising calls for protectionism in the United States and a series of negative comments about Americans by leading Japanese politicians.
"Anything like this comes at a bad time, but this is a particularly bad time," said Donald Klein, a professor of political science at Tufts University and an expert on Japan. Mr. Klein said that while Japanese tourists to the United States have often been the target of thieves or muggers, he believed that Mr. Matsuda was the most prominent Japanese ever to be the victim of a serious crime in this country.
Mr. Klein said the incident could buttress in some Japanese their views about the United States as a society in decline. In the last few years some Japanese have taken an increasingly dark and sometimes contemptuous view of the United States, focusing on issues like the high crime rate, poor public schools and what is perceived in Japan as a general lack of self-discipline.
Mr. Matsuda, a onetime university track star, had arrived in Boston Tuesday afternoon to participate in the ceremonial signing of what was described by school officials as a "sister school" agreement with the University of Massachusetts in Boston, an urban branch of the state university system. The signing, scheduled for today, has been postponed.
Toshiki Saito, the consul for economic affairs in the Japanese consulate in Boston, said of Mr. Matsuda's slaying, "This tragedy is upside down, the exact opposite of what he was aiming at." Mr. Matsuda had come to Boston, Mr. Saito said, "to promote better understanding betweeen the United States and Japan" through the cultural exchange program.
The incident was promptly reported in Japan, whose newspapers and television stations had many reporters in the Boston area Tuesday to cover the Presidential primary in New Hampshire.
The agreement between the two universities would allow students at each school to study at the other, to share research and to develop a program of seminars on international trade, according to Walter D. Littell, a spokesman for the Boston branch of the University of Massachusetts. It would expand an existing program that began in 1990 under which Chukyo University has sent 35 to 40 students to Boston each summer for a three-week course, he said.
 
No Decision About Agreement
 Commenting on the program's future, Mr. Littell said: "I think in the back of everyone's mind is, 'How are the Japanese going to react? What are they going to think, again, about America?' "
A member of the Chukyo delegation said no decision had been made about completing the agreement.
Chukyo, which has 11,500 students, is a relatively new university in Japan, having been established after World War II. Several Japanese journalists said the university is better known in Japan for its athletes than its scholars. Mr. Matsuda himself was trained as a sports psychologist.
Noboru Nakagaki, vice dean of the faculty of management at Chukyo and one of six members of the school's delegation visiting Boston, described Mr. Matsuda as "very good and gentle." He knew no one in Boston, Mr. Nakagaki said.
He said the delegation had arrived at Logan International Airport in Boston at 3:30 P.M. Tuesday and had just settled in their rooms at the Westin Hotel in the city's fashionable Back Bay section when the incident occured at about 6 P.M.
Mr. Saia, the Boston police superintendent, said that after the shooting Mrs. Matsuda, who does not speak English, "was running down the hallway banging on doors, trying to get somebody's attention."
William McCreary, a senior vice president of Westin Hotel & Resorts, said the incident was the first slaying in the hotel's eight-year history.
He also said the hotel has an excellent security record, although it is part of a large, heavily patronized shopping complex, Copley Place, and is only a few blocks from Boston's South End, a high-crime neighborhood.

HEADLINE: Tokyo Shift Seen on Rice

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

DATELINE: TOKYO, Thursday, Feb. 20

 BODY:
The Japanese Foreign Minister, Michio Watanabe, told lawmakers today that Japan had no choice but to open its rice market to imports, the Kyodo news service reported.
Replying to a question from an opposition member of the lower house of Parliament, Mr. Watanabe said Japan must open its market under a system of tariffs or risk being held responsible for a failure of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
 A breakdown of the GATT talks over agricultural trade would deal a severe blow to Japan's export-dependent economy, he said.
Assuming the United States and European Community reach agreement on a system of tariffs to replace nontariff trade barriers, Japan will have no choice but to go along, Mr. Watanabe said.
Japan's rice market is closed to all imports to protect the country's politically powerful farmers. Japanese rice costs roughly 10 times the global average.

HEADLINE: Beth Israel Reaches Pact With Union

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan reached a potentially precedent-setting accord with the hospital workers' union yesterday that guarantees all 4,000 employees their jobs for the duration of the 40-month contract, provides them with free medical benefits and creates an unusual partnership with management to improve recruitment, training and patient care.
The agreement does not specify the size of wage increases. Rather, it promises to match, at the union's option, whatever raises are negotiated either with the League of Voluntary Hospitals and Homes, the industry's main bargaining group for 38 institutions in New York City and Long Island, or with the hospitals operated in Manhattan and the Bronx by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York. 
 The accord approved yesterday by Beth Israel's board could have profound implications locally and nationally. It further signals a shift in organized labor's top priorities from pay increases to job security and health care.
 
Accord Reached Early
 Strategically, the early settlement -- more than three months before the industrywide contract expires -- echoes the union's 1989 divide-and-conquer technique when it reached agreement first with the Archdiocese and then divided the hospital league by luring defectors, among them Beth Israel.
With a high occupancy rate, Beth Israel is regarded as being in better financial condition than many other private and voluntary hospitals in the league, some of which are contemplating layoffs in response to state budget cuts. In recent years, it has also pursued a labor relations policy that Dennis Rivera, president of Local 1199 of the Drug, Hospital and Health Care Employees Union, has described as enlightened and has attributed largely to Beth Israel's president, Dr. Robert G. Newman.
The contract, Dr. Newman said, "is a very new approach and it is made possible because of a very specific set of circumstances at Beth Israel Medical Center and they relate to attitude."
The new contract, effective on July 1, represents "a commonality of interest," he said, in labor peace, job security and patient care and marks "the most productive way to enhance revenues and economize on costs."
"As much as it sounds like a radical approach, the Japanese workplace concept is what we are putting into practice," Dr. Newman said.
Victor Gotbaum, a former municipal labor leader who heads the Center for Labor Management Policy Studies at the City University of New York Graduate Center, described the job security, health benefit and joint management aspects of the agreement as "a stunning breakthrough."
Industry executives were considerably more subdued. Chastened by its first encounter with Mr. Rivera, who revived the local after years of dissension, the hospital league has hired a new president, a labor negotiator and a public relations adviser in a determined effort not to be whipsawed by the union again.
"It obviously doesn't set a pattern if there's no money," said Bruce C. McIver, the league's president, who previously headed the Long Island Rail Road and was the city's labor relations director. "I don't think it's terribly important from my perspective."
Edward Silver, a veteran labor lawyer who is the league's chief negotiator, was equally sanguine. "They had to do what they had to do that was best for them," he said of Beth Israel, "but I should think it would not have any meaningful effect on the league's negotiations."
 
Beth Israel Still in League
 Beth Israel is still a member of the league but as Dr. Newman said yesterday after the medical center's board voted, "our membership under these circumstances is an irrelevance." The board chairman, Morton P. Hyman, described the settlement as "equitable, fair and appropriate."
Local 1199 represents maintenance, service, clinical, technical and professional workers. It also negotiates for many private hospital nurses, although they are covered by a separate contract. Formal negotiations have not yet begun.
The no-layoff provision, broached by Dr. Newman early last month, was embraced enthusiastically by Mr. Rivera, who then proposed the partnership involving recruitment, training and service delivery.
When the league capitulated in 1989 hours before a strike deadline, the union won wage increases of 7 1/2, 7 1/2 and 5 percent, plus $500 in the final year. Mr. Rivera hinted that the recession, combined with budget cuts being imposed or threatened by Albany, make increases that large less likely this time.
But the agreement on guaranteed job security, free health care provided by a panel of Beth Israel doctors, the partnership that Mr. Rivera said would contribute to "a friendly workplace" and the hospital's pledge not to obstruct union organizing reflected what the union's nearly 100,000 members in the metropolitan region say are their priorities.
One option now available to union members is to obtain medical services from an approved panel of doctors without paying any out-of-pocket expenses, but the preferred provider organization that would be established by Beth Israel for Local 1199 members who work there apparently would significantly expand the existing program for in-patient and out-patient services.
While they are adversaries at the bargaining table, Mr. Rivera has enlisted executives of the private and nonprofit voluntary hospitals in lobbying for higher Medicaid reimbursement rates and other assistance from the state, local and Federal governments, which benefit both the institutions and their workers.

HEADLINE: Hearing NASA Head, Panel Condemns His Ouster

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 19

 BODY:
Members of Congress today condemned what they said was the forced resignation of the space agency administrator, Richard H. Truly.
Their comments came as Mr. Truly appeared before them to defend the Bush Administration's budget for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. 
 Representative Norman Mineta, Democrat of California, said the Administration was using the space agency as "a political poker chip" and "a public relations tool for the rehabilitation of Dan Quayle."
Vice President Quayle and the National Space Council, which he heads, have been at odds with NASA and Mr. Truly over management issues. President Bush said last week that he had "regretfully" accepted Mr. Truly's resignation, although Mr. Truly said he had been asked to step down.
"Whatever political or policy agendas the White House may have, neither NASA or Admiral Truly deserve this treatment," Mr. Mineta said. Other Congressmen of both parties praised Mr. Truly's tenure.
 
Republicans Are Critical
 Mr. Truly appeared before the Space Subcommittee of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology. He defended the Administration's proposed $15 billion budget for NASA in the fiscal year 1993, although he said it provided for no growth after inflation.
But Republicans were sharply critical of that budget. Representative James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin and others said the Administration is trying to continue too many space programs while failing to set priorities and eliminate unworthy projects.
Representative Dick Zimmer of New Jersey called it "a Buck Rogers budget -- long on fantasy but short on reality."
"There simply will not be enough money available in the future to complete all the programs set forth in this spending blueprint," Mr. Zimmer said.
Mr. Truly's resignation, effective on April 1, comes as the agency faces another battle in Congress over efforts to eliminate the $30 billion space station, which would receive $2.25 billion in the next fiscal year. Mr. Truly said that budget cuts had forced a nine-month delay on the station but that it remains essentially on schedule.

HEADLINE: 2 Items to Spur Investments Put Into Democrats' Tax Bill

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 19

 BODY:
Responding to protests from their colleagues that their tax plan offered little to stimulate the economy, Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee modified the measure today to add two provisions to spur investment.
In a two-hour party caucus this morning, complaints rose across a broad spectrum of ideology that the original recommendation of a permanent one percentage point cut in the corporate income tax would not only do little good but would also look bad when compared with the measure's two-year cut in taxes for the middle class. 
 So the committee Democrats agreed this afternoon to scale back that corporate tax reduction to two years, which put their measure in surplus by $7.1 billion over six years. The tax increases in the measure, primarily increases in the top personal income tax rates, total $93.3 million.
They agreed on two other two-year measures. One was President Bush's proposal for an Investment Tax Allowance permitting increased first-year depreciation for new equipment. The second was a plan to allow small businesses to deduct directly -- instead of depreciating -- up to $25,000 of new investment instead of the current $10,000.
Democrats will discuss the revised plan at another party caucus on Thursday. If the changes are sufficient to satisfy today's critics, they plan to bring the measure to the House floor for a vote next week.
While the Democrats were tinkering, House Republicans were plotting and chortling. Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the No. 2 Republican in the House, said his troops planned to disrupt the House next week if the Democrats stacked procedural rules against them on the tax bill.
Democrats usually arrange House procedures to the disadvantage of the Republicans, who usually just complain. But Mr. Gingrich said his party would do more next week, using tactics he likened to those employed by outraged House members in the last century and by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in the 20th.
The Republicans, at a caucus of their own, did not discuss adding any provisions to Mr. Bush's seven-point plan that he says is urgently needed to bolster the economy. Mr. Gingrich said that while some members might have suggested adding some form of middle-income tax break of their own, they did not because they enjoyed being in the position of citing the statement of the Democratic winner in the New Hampshire primary, former Senator Paul Tsongas, that he would veto the Democratic bill if he were President.
 
Tsongas Stand Invoked
 Representative Jerry Lewis, chairman of the House Republican Conference, called on Democrats to respond to their leader in New Hampshire. Mr. Gingrich said Democrats "refuse to pass a signable growth proposal and will not even write one that their own candidate, Paul Tsongas, would sign."
Mr. Tsongas has been especially critical of the heart of the Democratic measure, two years of tax credits of up to $400 a year for a couple earning $26,000 or more, and up to $200 for individuals earning $13,000 or more.
President Bush said today in Knoxville, Tenn.: "It's a little ironic that the Democratic front-runner, who could well be the party's standard-bearer, opposes what the Democrats in the House of Representatives are doing. I mean they are out of step with their own leader at this point."
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, asked his view of Mr. Tsongas's stand, said, "I don't agree with it, and the public will decide whether Senator Dukakis is going to be able to veto anything." Mr. Foley later he had not meant to confuse Mr. Tsongas, a former Senator from Massachusetts, with that state's former Governor, Michael S. Dukakis, the Democrats' losing Presidential candidate in 1988. He said: "That was a slip. I'm not snide."
The latest version of the Democratic bill makes no changes in either its tax credit provision, questioned at this morning's caucus because it was temporary, or its plan to index capital gains to inflation, which went largely without criticism today.
The caucus began, several lawmakers reported, with a strong plea for party unity from Mr. Foley, and was punctuated by reminders that the Democrats, having made a fairness argument against the Republicans for months, had to keep on making it.
One of the sharpest criticisms came from Representative David R. Obey of Wisconsin. Later, speaking more mildly, he told reporters that not many people had asked for the corporate rate cut, and that there were better uses for the money. He said the cut had been defended by members of the Ways and Means Committee today as a way to offer something to business in a way that would "fend off worse things that would have made the package vulnerable to a bigger bidding war."
Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts called the corporate rate issue the major bone of contention at the caucus. He said it "would not be particularly stimulative" and was expensive.
But even the provision's critics said passing the bill quickly was important. "The worst thing is to flounder," said Representative Leon Panetta of California.
"The faster we move the better," said Representative Timothy J. Penny of Minnesota.

HEADLINE: Anti-Crime Lottery Sales Falling Far Short of Goal

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
New York City officials said yesterday that a special city lottery intended to raise money for Mayor David N. Dinkins's broad anti-crime program has fallen far short of expectations and is now projected to produce just $5 million of the $38 million they orginally planned for this fiscal year.
The Mayor disclosed the shortfall as he announced the creation of a new $1 scratch-off game -- half the price of the old one -- that officials hope will step up sales. Last fall the city said the special lottery was raising only about half of what they expected, which they attributed to the price and to skepticism about how the proceeds would be used. 
 The collapse of the special city lottery undermines an important source of revenue for Mr. Dinkins's anti-crime program, which besides hiring more police officers was to expand education and youth programs. From the start, many city officials were skeptical about the lottery as a revenue source.
For the fiscal year that ends on June 30, the bulk of the anti-crime program's money, $130 million, is to come from a special property tax, and that is still on target, officials said.
 
Educational Programs
 By law, the money from the lottery was earmarked for educational programs -- $31 million for the Board of Education and $7 million for libraries -- and city officials said they would still provide the full $38 million to those agencies despite the falloff, making up the difference with unspecified cuts and savings elsewhere in the city's $29 billion budget.
But because of the city's earlier cuts in the Board of Education budget, board officials had said they have been able to count on using only about $3 million of the lottery money for the new after-school programs the Mayor originally envisioned, with the rest going to make up for cuts in basic classroom services.
Deputy Schools Chancellor Stanley Litow said that problem had not changed. He said the board had not had any discussions with the city about the latest lowered projections for the lottery. "But if the city is interested in continuing to provide funds to the board and holding us harmless for this," he said, "that would be good news."
At a City Hall news conference, the Mayor said: "As is true with so many elements of our local economy, the revenue shortfall for our 'Safe Streets' lottery games reflects national trends. This year, fully one-third of states that have lotteries have experienced a decline in revenues from the previous year."
Mr. Dinkins said the state expects to have its first decline in annual lottery revenues in 24 years.
 
'Invest in Kids'
 The $2 game was called "Invest in Kids" and used radio and bus-stop advertisements of a somber Mr. Dinkins urging New Yorkers to buy its silver and blue tickets. But from its start in September to January, it sold only about $3.4 million in tickets, producing $900,000 in revenues for the city and awarding the top prize, a $25,000 jackpot, only once.
For the new fiscal year that starts on July 1, city budget officials are projecting that the city lottery will raise $50 million.
Officials are hoping that the new game will perform roughly four times as well in the rest of this fiscal year. It is called "City Jackpot," with Day-Glo pink, green and yellow tickets, and will offer a much smaller jackpot -- $100 -- but more chances to win, with overall odds of 1 in 4.45 chances. The object is to find three matching drawings of apples, taxis, pretzels and other symbols of the city under any of three coated panels on the back of each ticket.
The type of symbol determines the prize, with three Empire State Buildings winning $100.
Even losers can have a second chance at a grand-prize sightseeing trip to California for four. Players can mail their losing tickets and an entry coupon to be eligible for a prize drawing March 16. New York Newsday and Newsday will run entry blanks.
Tickets will be sold at more than 4,200 lottery sales outlets in the city and at all 97 New York City Offtrack Betting parlors. Players must be at least 18 years old. Half of all sales revenues are to go for prize money, 15 percent to the New York Lottery for production and distribution costs, and the rest to the city for the anti-crime program.

In a report that showed continued gains in new-home construction, builders in January broke ground on new dwellings at an annual pace of 1,167,000, the briskest since May 1990.
The 5.5 percent surge from December's 1,106,000 pace marked the fourth month in a row without a decline, but the gain was less robust than it appeared since it was heavily concentrated in apartment-house construction, which had nose-dived the month before. Moreover, the rise occurred only in the Midwest, with starts edging down in the South and West and falling 7 percent in the Northeast. 
 Still, the figures were seen as further improvement in the only sector besides exports that contributed to the small increase in gross domestic product during the final three months of 1991.
"The trend is definitely positive," commented David W. Berson, chief economist for the Federal National Mortgage Association. He noted that while starts remained at less than two-thirds of their recent-year peak of 1.8 million in 1986, the 1991 record was one of steady improvement. Of the last 12 months, starts rose in eight and were steady in two, with declines only in March and September.
Today's Commerce Department report on permits issued for future construction was solidly positive, up 6 percent with virtually all the improvement in single-family houses, which have more impact than multifamily units on the economy at large. Sizable increases were posted in both the Northeast and the Midwest, while the South eked out a small gain. Permits were essentially unchanged in the West.
Some builders, it appeared, obtained permits last month that they failed to use, perhaps because of bad weather.
Although the number of permits issued is a component of the Government's index of leading indicators that tend to move ahead of the economy as a whole, builders frequently start single-family homes in the same month they acquire the needed permits. Multifamily housing, on the other hand, generally requires long-run plans.
Analysts also pointed to considerable other evidence that housing is increasingly buoyant, aided by sharp reductions in interest rates that moved as low as about 8 1/4 percent for 30-year conventional mortgages before rebounding in recent weeks to about 8 3/4 percent.
 
Ranks of Customers
 Sales of both new and existing homes are taking wing, mortgage applications are climbing similarly, contract cancellation rates have dropped and real estate agents in many parts of the country see swelling ranks of potential customers.
An agent in the Maryland suburbs of Washington espressed amazement on Sunday about how many for-sale signs had suddenly sprouted in the neighborhood where she was conducting an open house, apparently reflecting a belief that buyers are once again to be found.
On Tuesday, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation reported in its quarterly survey of real estate trends that housing improved substantially from late October to late January while the market for commercial properties remained depressed.
"Field reports showing rebounding housing activity outnumbered negative assessments by better than a four-to-one margin," William R. Watson, director of the agency's research division, said. The F.D.I.C.'s composite index for both residential and commercial real estate climbed to 60 last month from 57 in October.
 
Large Buildings Gain
 Today's report on housing starts showed single-family starts last month at a pace of 974,000, compared with 965,000 in December while dwellings in two- to four-unit structures eased to 31,000 from 44,000. Large buildings, with five or more dwellings, contained 162,000 new units at an annual rate, up from 97,000 in December and 145,000 in November.
Geographically, overall starts were at a rate of 459,000 in the South, 324,000 in the Midwest, 250,000 in the West and 134,000 in the Northeast. Permits, which totaled 1,118,000, were 430,000 in the South, 285,000 in the Midwest, 267,000 in the West and 136,000 in the Northeast.
Actual starts, without seasonal adjustment or annualization, amounted to 72,500 last month, compared with 52,500 in January 1991.
The department also reported that shipments of mobile homes, which lag a month, rose 3 percent in December to a rate of 176,000. For the year, shipments dropped 9 percent, to 170,900.

HEADLINE: A New Breed of Sam Spade Trails Crooks' Hidden Assets

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON

 BODY:
Ed Pankau is a private investigator who seems to have walked off the pages of a pulp novel. A former Green Beret and the son of a bootlegger, the 46-year-old private eye has had his share of cases involving murder, mayhem and colorful characters.
A green Bugatti sports car adorns his suburban driveway. He won it years ago in a jailhouse poker game from a client, a wealthy rancher accused of manslaughter. In Mr. Pankau's world there are good guys and bad guys. Mr. Pankau is a good guy; he invariably describes his quarry as "sleaze balls" or "dirt bags" or both. 
 Despite his hard-boiled manner, Mr. Pankau is one of the new breed of financial sleuths who track down the assets hidden by white-collar crooks. And it is a booming field, thanks to the savings and loan debacle, bank failures, corporate bankruptcies and financial scandals like the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. When successful, these asset hunters can save taxpayers and lenders millions of dollars.
"We're in an age of high-tech crime, so the people with the skills to handle those investigations are in demand," said Joseph Wells, chairman of the National Association of Certified Fraud Examiners, a 5,000-member organization that trains investigators.
Today, financial investigation has become a flourishing business, embracing several hundred practitioners with a variety of skills, including so-called forensic accountants at major accounting firms like Price Waterhouse and Arthur Andersen.
But the new-breed private investigators are on the front lines. Some are lone wolves; others work for large firms like Kroll Associates Inc. of New York, which tracked Saddam Hussein's assets for Kuwait, or medium-size firms like Mr. Pankau's Intertect Inc. in Houston, which has pursued the assets of many failed savings and loans and helped the Panamanian Government search for the assets of Gen. Manuel Noriega, its deposed leader.
 
Foray in Panama
 Mr. Pankau was in Panama on an insurance investigation during the American invasion in 1990. In the confusion, he slipped into a building and made off with a computer printout listing more than $800 million in assets held in 18 countries, assets he is convinced are General Noriega's personal holdings.
Such forays have given Mr. Pankau the reputation of "a guy who kicks down doors," one rival said. Even his wife, Linda, said: "I don't ask questions about how Ed does what he does. I'm not sure I want to know."
But the Texas Board of Private Investigators says it has never had a serious complaint against Mr. Pankau, who readily acknowledges that he relies more on painstaking work than derring-do.
Unlike the Sam Spades of the past, who relied on a .38, a hip flask and a hunch, today's private eyes use computers and data bases. They tend to be accountants or former agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation or, like Mr. Pankau, of the Internal Revenue Service.
The new-style sleuths have even made inroads into the tradition-steeped genre of the detective novel with the appearance of characters like Catherine Sayler, a financial private investigator in Linda Grant's "Blind Trust," and Jay Jasen, an accountant in Jim Weikart's "Casualty Loss."
By most accounts, Mr. Pankau is a leader in applying computer-age technology to the cottage industry of private investigation.
"He's established the standards in this industry," said Charles Peck, vice president of marketing for Prentice Hall Legal and Financial Services, a unit of Paramount Communications Inc. that markets data bases of business and government records. "Once you get beyond Ed Pankau's rough-hewn promotional style, there is a lot of substance."
The Prentice Hall unit looked for a partner with expertise in finding hidden assets. After interviewing major accounting firms and several financial investigation firms, it chose Mr. Pankau to help develop methods so that Prentice Hall's extensive data bases of corporate and public records could be used more efficiently for asset searches.
The slumping economy and the financial wreckage of the last decade are fueling the demand for such services. The Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency established by Congress in 1989 to clean up the savings-and-loan mess, has created a huge market for financial experts as it tries to recover assets of the more than 650 failed institutions seized by the Government. Even though it has its own investigative staff, Resolution Trust contracts out asset-search work to 45 private firms. It also hired Mr. Pankau to help write a handbook on asset searches.
Other work comes from corporate clients. A bank, for example, will often hire a private investigator when a large individual borrower has fallen behind on loan payments. The bank wants to know what assets the person may have stashed away that could be put up as additional collateral, as real estate values fall. Banks also want to know how tight the client's financial pinch is, because the borrower's problems may soon become the bank's.
"The bank is often not yet in court, but it's in a fight and it wants to strengthen its bargaining position with a problem client," said Dan Karson, general counsel of Kroll Associates, which has conducted many such investigations for banks.
 
His First Assignment
 Mr. Pankau got into the asset-search business in 1978, tracing the recoverable funds of five small Texas banks that had failed because of bad management and fraud. His client was the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. He seemed to have been overly optimistic in taking the assignment; his three-person firm had to hunt for any seizable assets on about 500 bad loans in little more than a year.
"You never could have done it by the old method of going to the courthouse and pawing through the public records," Mr. Pankau recalled. "I realized there had to be a better way to do it."
So he made microfiche copies of government records, which he took to his office, and organized the bank records looking for patterns in the loan problems. He noticed, for example, that there were dozens of cases of local police officers who had taken out $10,000 car loans, made one payment, then retired and moved out of the state. Mr. Pankau located them for the banking authorities by tracing where their pension checks were sent.
Recognizing the potential for automation, Mr. Pankau bought 10 computers in 1983 in a bankruptcy sale. That move was prescient. In the last five years or so, the amount of information on people and companies available to anyone with a computer and a telephone has grown enormously. There are now thousands of data bases listing motor vehicle registrations, property held, assumed names, utility bills and owners of race horses and private aircraft.
 
Saving Time
 While the computer does not solve cases, it cuts the time spent on asset searches from days to hours. Mr. Pankau's contribution to the craft has been devising the methodology for searches, starting with personal information, by feeding Social Security numbers and dates of birth into a computer, then moving to business records, litigation history and other clues.
"In complex cases, you still have to travel, pore over documents and talk to people," Mr. Pankau said. "But the computer has revolutionized this business."
Today, Intertect has 46 employees, with offices in Houston, Dallas, San Antonio and Phoenix, and revenues of more than $3 million a year. Its clients include Chase Manhattan, Bank of America, Bank of New England, First Interstate and Bank One, Texas. The business has been growing roughly 40 percent a year in the last few years, and Mr. Pankau expects it to reach $10 million in three years.
His biggest client is the United States Government, going after assets connected with failed savings and loans and banks. He also instructs Federal agents on the fine points of financial investigations.
Mr. Pankau has searched for hidden assets connected to more than 100 failed institutions. Both the Government and private clients demand that pending cases not be discussed. And most of the cases do not become public, because Federal agencies and banks generally try to settle out of court, rather than lose years and millions of dollars in legal fees.
Yet bankers whom Mr. Pankau has worked for acknowledge that he has found hidden assets in forms ranging from gold coins buried in an executive's backyard to ill-gotten funds in Cayman Islands bank accounts to millions stashed in a child's trust fund. In the trust fund case, a former savings and loan executive received $10,000 a month as a "charity" payment from his child's trust.
Mr. Pankau's most notable savings and loan case to date has been investigating fraud and searching for assets held by the officers and directors of Vernon Savings and Loan Association of Vernon, Tex. In 1990 and 1991, Vernon's former executives, Don R. Dixon and Woody F. Lemons, were given lengthy prison terms and assessed more than $10 million in fines.
"The amazing thing in the Vernon case is how much money was blown on high living, hookers, yachts, you name it," Mr. Pankau said. "But I'm convinced Don Dixon still has a cash hoard someplace, maybe $50 million."

HEADLINE: Stocks Are Mixed, With the Dow Up 5.59

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks closed mixed yesterday with blue-chip issues up slightly and the broader market moderately weak. A firm bond market helped lift stocks from early losses, and the Dow Jones industrial average closed up 5.59 points, to 3,230.32
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was heavy at 234.8 million shares, up from 234.3 million on Tuesday. The Big Board composite index rose 0.20 point, to 225.85, with losing issues outnumbering gainers by 963 to 753. 
 "The release of surprisingly stronger January Consumer Price Index and January housing starts data turned an already down bond market around, lifting the stock market with it," said Ricky Harrington, director of equity investments for Marion Bass Securities.
With the January inflation rate coming in at a low one-tenth of 1 percent and housing starts showing a sharp gain, investors bought cyclical Dow stocks.
 
Greenspan Testimony
 At the same time, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said in his semiannual Congressional testimony yesterday that he saw a pickup in business activity.
Some analysts warned, however, that the uncertainty created by President Bush's narrow victory in the New Hampshipre primary injected a potential negative to market volatility, which could translate to lower prices over the next few weeks.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks, another blue-chip barometer, rose 0.88 point yesterday, to 408.26, while the American Stock Exchange index fell 1.74 points, to 407.46. Trading on the Nasdaq, also heavy throughout the day, pulled the composite down 4 points, to 622.41, with the Russell 2,000 index down 1.72 points, to 208.36.
Rohr Industries fell 2, to 18 1/8, as the company faces possible criminal charges from a Government inquiry into its Riverside, Calif., plant that may result in substantial fines, suspension and debarment proceedings. The plant, which produces parts for military aircraft, accounts for about 8 percent of Rohr's $1.3 billion in annual revenues.
First Union rose 1 1/8, to 37, after the financial institution raised the quarterly dividend to 31 cents from 28 cents, and Sandra Flannigan, an analyst for Alex. Brown & Sons, raised her recommendation to a "strong buy," adjusting the 1992 earnings estimate to $3.25 a share from $3.10.
Biomet, which makes surgical implants and orthopedic devices, rose 2 1/8, to 23, after saying it was comfortable with analysts' third-quarter earnings estimates of 11 to 12 cents a share. In the third quarter a year ago, the company earned 9 cents a share.
Centocor fell 8 1/8, to 33 1/8. The biotech company, which is suing Xoma Inc. and Pfizer Inc. over a patent that covers a mouse monoclonal antibody, reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $1.19 a share and said the Food and Drug Administration had raised additional issues concerning its product license for the HA-1A, an antibody.
Shares of Systemix Inc. tumbled 15, to 39 3/4, after Sandoz A.G.'s deal to buy a 60 percent stake in the biotech company was completed and its tender offer for about half of its shares was oversubscribed, analysts said.
Hewlett-Packard, rose 9 1/8, to 73 1/2. Tim McCollum, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, raised his earnings estimate for the fiscal year, after the company reported a stronger-than-expected first quarter of $1.21 a share, compared with 83 cents.
Analysts said PNC Financial, the Pitsburgh-based bank holding company held a positive meeting with them Tuesday, convincing many that it has decisively dealt with its problems. Nancy Bush, an analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman, raised her repeated "strong buy" recommendation, while Thaddeus Paluszcek, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody & Company, raised the rating to "buy" from "hold." PNC stock rose 1 7/8, to 48 5/8, as both analysts also raised their 1992 and 1993 earnings estimates.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Key Lawmaker Wants to Keep Bell Companies Out of Information Business

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 19

 BODY:
Newspaper publishers received support today from an important lawmaker in their campaign to keep the regional Bell telephone companies from being allowed to own electronic services offering information like news, stock quotations and sports scores.
At a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommitte on Economic and Commercial Law, Representative Jack Brooks, Democrat of Texas and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, made it clear that he favored continuing restrictions on the Bell companies. His committee has jurisdiction over antitrust issues. 
 Mr. Brooks attacked a recent court ruling that lifted a restriction on the Bell companies' owning information services. He ridiculed what he called the "child-like faith" of the Federal Communications Commission in pursuing a policy that he said was based only on "deregulation, deregulation, deregulation."
But other lawmakers on the panel at the crowded hearing today remained divided and ambivalent about the best way to address the issue, which has fueled multimillion-dollar lobbying and advertising efforts by the telephone companies and their opponents.
At issue are restrictions in the antitrust consent decree that broke up the American Telephone and Telegraph Company in 1984. These restrictions bar the seven regional "Baby Bell" companies created in the breakup from owning information services, manufacturing equipment or providing long-distance service.
But a recent court decision by Federal District Judge Harold H. Greene, who oversees the consent decree, lifted the ban on Bell companies' providing information services. That spurred frantic efforts by newspapers and other information providers to persuade Congress to reverse the ruling and forbid phone companies to enter their business.
The House is also considering legislation, already passed by the Senate, that would lift the prohibition on the Bell companies' making equipment. Those bills have aroused fierce opposition from A.T.&T., which retained the right to make equipment under the consent decree.
The battle on both issues comes amid a growing debate about the best way to foster international competitiveness in the telecommunications industry. The Bell companies -- Nynex, Bell Atlantic, BellSouth, Ameritech, Southwestern Bell, U S West and Pacific Telesis -- argue that they must be unshackled if they are to build advanced networks that can deliver everything from video programs to high-resolution medical images and "electronic yellow pages."
"Our nation urgently needs a coherent, efficient and competitive telecommunications policy," said Ivan Seidenberg, vice chairman of Nynex. "Does it make sense to exclude from the market companies with $160 billion in assets?"
But existing information providers argue that the Bell companies still retain a monopoly over local telephone services and would use this advantage to undercut the prices of competitors in information services.
 
Criticism of Newspapers
 While many lawmakers expressed concern about potential abuses by the Bell companies, some also had reservations about the newspaper industry.
Representative John Bryant, a Texas Democrat who supports tougher restrictions on the Bells, argued that the "newspaper industry is run by a group of monopolists or near-monopolists" in many cities.
Indeed, he said, representatives of the A. H. Belo Corporation, owner of The Dallas Morning News, came to his office arguing for tougher restrictions on the Bell companies at the same time that The Morning News was seeking permission from the Justice Department to buy the assets of The Dallas Times-Herald and allow it to cease publication.
In another twist, the newspapers were represented at the hearings in part by David E. Easterly, president of Cox Newspapers, publisher of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and other newspapers. Cox Enterprises, the corporate parent, operates the fifth-largest cable television company and plans to enter the telephone business.
 
Monopoly Position
 Cox recently acquired 12.5 percent of the Teleport Communications Group, a fiber-optic company that competes against local telephone companies. In addition, Cox has built an experimental wireless telephone system in San Diego. On Tuesday, the nation's largest cable company, Tele-Communications Inc. of Denver, moved to join Cox by agreeing to buy a 49.9 percent stake in Teleport from Merrill Lynch & Company.
But Mr. Easterly argued that the Bell companies retained a monopoly position in the local telephone market and would use it to dominate the market for electronic information.
"Our classified ads are a primary target for the 'telcos,' " he testified. Unshackling the telephone companies "would be devastating for newspapers."
Prospects for legislation are uncertain. Representative Jim Cooper, Democrat of Tennessee, has introduced legislation that would bar the telephone companies from information services unless a competing network can reach at least half the homes in a market.
But Representative Edward Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee with jurisdiction over telecommunications policy, favors a broader bill that would give the Bells greater freedom.

HEADLINE: CONSUMER RATES;
Yields on Money Funds Are Down Slightly

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
The yields on both tax-exempt and taxable funds moved down a bit for the week ended Tuesday, according to IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report.
"Once more the yields on the tax-exempts declined," said Walter Frank, economist for Donoghue's. "And what we see is that the flow of money into the funds has dried up a little because of lower yields in the latest weekly period." As for the taxable yields, he said that large amounts of institutional money had moved out of the taxables to seek better yields elsewhere: for instance, in commercial paper or Eurodollar deposits. 
 Mr. Frank added that "the odds still favored a further easing by the Federal Reserve system" even after the Fed on Tuesday lowered the required reserves of its member banks.
The seven-day compounded average yield for the tax-exempt funds dropped 8 basis points, to 2.73 percent, while the seven-day simple yield dropped to 2.69 percent, also down 8 basis points. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.
In the same period, the 30-day compounded yield dropped 2 basis points, to 2.80 percent, and the 30-day simple yield also fell 2 basis points, to 2.76 percent.
 
Top Performers
 Among the yield leaders in the New York area, the top Connecticut fund again was Fidelity Spartan Connecticut Municipal Money Market Portfolio, which reported a seven-day compounded yield of 3.24 percent, down 11 basis points from the previous week.
In New Jersey, the top fund once again was Fidelity Spartan N.J. Municipal Money Market Portfolio, with a yield at 3.32 percent, down 14 points.
In New York, the top fund again was Salomon Brothers N.Y. Municipal Money Market fund. It had a seven-day compounded yield of 3.64 percent, down 10 basis points.
Assets of the tax-exempt funds dropped from the record $98.9 billion to $98.8 billion.
Donoghue's said the average number of days to maturity of securities held in the tax-free portfolios moved up one day, to 51.
Of the funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's with assets larger than $100 million, the Strong Municipal Money Market Fund, Milwaukee, continued to lead the way with a seven-day compounded yield of 3.66 percent, down from 3.73 percent.
 
Taxable Funds
 Assets of the taxable funds, which were at a record level of $509.7 billion the previous week, declined in the latest period by $13.1 billion, to $496.6 billion. Most of the withdrawals -- $12.5 billion -- were by institutions seeking higher rates elsewhere.
Mr. Frank noted that the average days to maturity of holdings in the taxable funds rose by one day, to 58.
The average seven-day compounded taxable yield was off 6 basis points, to 3.86 percent, while the seven-day simple yield fell 7 points, to 3.78 percent.
At the same time, the 30-day compounded yield declined to 3.98 percent, a drop of 7 basis points, and the 30-day simple yield dropped to 3.90 percent, also off 7 basis points from the previous week.
Two taxable funds tied for first place with the best seven-day compounded yield for the week. They were Fidelity Spartan Money Market fund, the previous week's leader, and Riverside Capital Money Market Fund, which is distributed by the Winsbury Company of Columbus, Ohio, both reporting a yield of 4.58 percent.
By comparison, the average bank money market account, a prime competitor of money funds, was at 3.75 percent, according to The Bank Rate Monitor's national index.

HEADLINE: Little of $100 Billion Loss Can Be Retrieved

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
During the 1980's, the savings and loan industry was a playpen for white-collar criminals. Losses from the debacle are estimated at roughly $100 billion, and while reckless lending in an overheated real estate market accounted for much of that, fraud by savings and loan officers and directors added billions of dollars to the bill for taxpayers.
In fact, fraud contributed to the collapse of 35 percent of the more than 650 savings institutions under control of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency created to clean up the industry's mess. 
 How much of the money can be recovered by financial investigators?
Most experts estimate that only 5 percent to 10 percent of the losses can be traced and retrieved. Some former savings executives have stashed away millions, but most of the money has been squandered and spent, the experts say.
The story of the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, which collapsed in 1989 at an estimated cost to taxpayers of $2.6 billion, is instructive. The huge losses and free-spending style of Lincoln's flamboyant former chairman, Charles H. Keating Jr., made the case a priority for the Government.
The Lincoln affair will be a matter of litigation for years, but so far, settlements accounting for less than $100 million have been reached. With luck, Government officials and investigators say, the total recovered for investors and taxpayers may eventually reach $200 million. Mr. Keating has been indicted on Federal charges of fraud, conspiracy and racketeering. He was convicted of securities fraud last year on state charges in California and is free on bail awaiting sentencing.
Savings executives typically spent lavishly on themselves and others. They paid exorbitant salaries to colleagues and high fees to advisers.
"Most of the money is spent in the American economy -- it's in Mercedes-Benz sedans on Rodeo Drive, spent on fancy restaurants in Los Angeles and elsewhere," said Peter B. Frank, a partner for Price Waterhouse & Company, which investigated the financial manipulations at Lincoln. "You don't usually find enormous cash hoards."
James Dudine, Resolution Trust's director of investigations, agreed: "There's no question that most of the money is gone. We're not going to recover a billion or two from Charlie Keating. It just isn't there."
 
Investigators' Goals
 For financial investigators, the goal in most cases is to find hidden assets and enough incriminating evidence to persuade the people under investigation to repay the money instead of facing prosecution.
The preferred method, they say, is to avoid the American court system. Otherwise, a defendant can put off a final judgment and repayment for five to seven years.
"For the real smart guys, white-collar crime does pay," said Ed Pankau, a Houston private investigator. "If you steal enough, you can afford to hire the high-priced legal talent so that you can keep some of your money."

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Wheat Up as Traders See Moves by Ex-Soviet Lands

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Wheat futures prices pulled out of a nose dive and ended with a modest gain yesterday on a report that the former Soviet republics were buying wheat futures.
Such activity, rare in the last year, could indicate the Commonwealth of Independent States was locking in prices for future wheat purchases, analysts said. 
 Wheat for delivery in March finished 1/4 cent above Tuesday's settlement at $4.11 3/4 a bushel after trading as low as $4.01 1/2 during yesterday's session.
Wheat has tumbled more than 50 cents since hitting an 11-year high of $4.63 1/4 on Feb. 10. It halted its slide toward $4 after the market wire service Futures World News reported that Exportkhleb, the grain-buying agency of the former Soviet Union, was buying United States wheat futures.
Such transactions, while not unheard of, have been rare in the last year because the republics' dire financial condition has restricted their ability to buy grain.
The commonwealth was also perceived as having temporarily satisfied its need for wheat with recent credit purchases subsidized and guaranteed by the United States Government.
"It sure turned the market around," Katharina Zimmer, grains analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc., said of the report. She said she could not confirm it.
Susan Leighty, an analyst at Prudential Securities Inc., said she had doubts about the report in light of the commonwealth's economic distress.
"Given their financial problems, it raises some skepticism," she said.
Corn and soybean futures also rebounded strongly after following wheat lower early in the session. Their late advance was driven partly by ideas that tight wheat supplies could prompt farmers to expand spring wheat plantings at the expense of soybeans and corn, said Gordon Linn, president of Linnco Futures Inc. in Chicago.
Oil futures recovered some of Tuesday's sharp losses on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Most traders viewed the action as a natural rebound after crude oil plunged more than $1.30 a barrel on Tuesday in reaction to smaller-than-expected OPEC production cuts.
After the close, the American Petroleum Institute said in a weekly report that United States gasoline stocks rose last week by nearly three million barrels, an unexpectedly large increase that could put pressure on prices.
Crude oil stocks fell by two million barrels, as expected, while heating-oil stocks dropped nearly six million barrels, a larger-than-expected decline.
Crude oil for March delivery rose 29 cents, to $18.41 a barrel; March heating oil rose 1.18 cents, to 52.50 cents a gallon; March unleaded gasoline rose 0.74 cent, to 55.82 cents a gallon; March natural gas rose 5.8 cents, to $1.139 for 1,000 cubic feet.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar in a Broad Retreat, But Gains Against the Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar settled lower against all major currencies except the Japanese yen yesterday in thin, uneventful trading.
Gold prices were down in United States trading. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $353 a troy ounce, off 40 cents from Tuesday. The Republic National Bank said gold slid 5 cents an ounce, to a late bid price of $352.75. 
 Analysts said currency traders were not particularly inspired by the latest economic data, which were better than expected. The Labor Department said consumer prices rose just one-tenth of 1 percent in January, the best inflation performance in six months. Separately, the Commerce Department reported that housing starts rose a strong 5.5 percent in January.
"The market took it all in stride," said Randolph Donney, research director at Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J.
The market also shrugged off the Congressional testimony of Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, who reiterated that recent cuts in interest rates should be enough to guarantee a sustained recovery later this year.
"The market is waiting to see if its recent move up is legitimate," Mr. Donney said, which would be supported by signs that "the economy is really starting to come out of recession."
The dollar's move above 128 Japanese yen did not prompt any intervention by the central banks. That "emboldened speculators to test the dollar's upside," said Marc Chandler, an analyst with the advisory firm IDEA.
Still, the currency held to a relatively narrow range throughout the session.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose 1.03 yen, to a closing 128.20 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at 128.35 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 128.20 yen, up from 128.00 yen on Tuesday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.7510, from $1.7500 late Tuesday. In New York, it cost $1.7565 to buy one pound, more expensive than Tuesday's $1.7545.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Wall St. Support For Oregon Steel

BYLINE: By Jonathan P. Hicks

 BODY:
SOME Wall Street analysts are turning their attention to Oregon Steel Mills Inc., a minimill that produces steel by melting scrap and has the distinction of being the only American steelmaker to increase profits last year.
While Nucor Inc., the North Carolina producer of steel joists, bars and sheets, has long been the most prominent of the mini-mills, Oregon Steel has drawn a following for its niche products. The low-cost producer of steel plate and pipe has benefited from the surge in demand in the last two years for steel plate products to build or rehabilitate highways, bridges and oil and gas pipelines in California and other Western states. 
 The company, now one of the leading suppliers of plate and pipe products on the West Coast, earned $36.9 million last year, up 29 percent from $28.5 million in 1990. Revenue increased 47 percent, to $489.4 million from $333.6 million, despite the recession.
"They have been very successful because their markets surged and they have come to dominate the California and Oregon markets," said John Jacobson, an analyst with AUS Consultants in Philadelphia. "They are seeing much greater demand from oil and gas pipeline companies."
Analysts' enthusiasm is also based on the fact that Oregon Steel has virtually no debt and no liabilities for retirees' health care or pensions.
"Its balance sheet is extremely strong and the company has shown that it could get through the current recession without the sharp drop in earnings or losses experienced by the other steelmakers," said Charles A. Bradford, a steel analyst with UBS Securities.
The company has sharply cut costs and increased efficiency in the last few years, spending about $150 million in the last five years to upgrade its operations. It now takes 2.4 hours for an employee to produce a ton of steel, compared with about 4 hours three years ago, the company said. That figure compares with an average of about 2.5 at other mini-mills and about 5.2 at the nation's six largest steelmakers.
Oregon Steel's productivity was also helped by a profit-sharing program that distributes 20 percent of the company's profits to employees.
Still, such enthusiasm is not reflected in the company's stock price. Oregon Steel, which sold as high as $38 in the middle of last year, fell to the mid-$20 range toward the end of last year. The stock closed yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange at $23.50, up 25 cents.
Mr. Bradford of UBS said the weakness in the stock price was largely a result of rumors about a possible acquisition by Oregon Steel of CF&I Steel, a maker of rail, bar and tubular steel products based in Colorado.
Other analysts suggest that the fall in stock price might reflect expectations that demand from the oil and gas pipeline business may have peaked and will sag through the rest of this year.
"The plate market softened late last year and Oregon Steel ran into some production problems," said Thomas M. Van Leeuwen, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers. But he cited the company's acquisitions as evidence that Oregon Steel was working to move into other markets and geographic areas. The company acquired a plate mill in 1989 and a pipe mill in 1987, both from Kaiser Steel. It is also moving into electric welded pipe for oil and gas exploration.
Whether a deal will develop between Oregon Steel & CF&I is still unclear. The Colorado company is the only leading producer of rail steel west of the Mississippi. But the company, which is operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, has many unresolved pension and retiree issues and Mr. Bradford said it was unlikely that an acquisition of CF&I would come in the near term, even though the depressed price of CF&I's stock presents a buying opportunity. Meanwhile, Oregon Steel continues to seek to reduce its dependence on niche markets by pursuing acquisitions and joint ventures. A proposed joint venture with Stelco, the Canadian steel producer, would give Oregon Steel access to the Canadian market while providing a strong customer for its steel plate.
"They have some good prospects in establishing joint ventures," Mr. Van Leeuwen said. "They have a track record of acquiring assets cheaply and making them pay off."

HEADLINE: California Fund In Housing Bid

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 19

 BODY:
The California Public Employees Retirement System voted Tuesday to increase the financing for a new program to spur construction of single-family homes in California.
The retirement system said it would increase by $150 million, to $375 million, its investment in partnerships set up to give a boost to the state's recession-battered construction business. The system, known as Calpers, voted last month to invest $225 million in the program, the first time a public pension fund has invested directly in the large-scale building of single-family houses. 
 The program is designed to offset partly the lack of available developer financing from banks and savings institutions. The additional $150 million will be invested through two money managers, Alex. Brown Kleinwort Benson and AMB Institutional Realty Advisors Inc.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Mets Have Put the Ball in Cone's Hand

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla., Feb. 19

 BODY:
The sun, perhaps appropriately, disappeared briefly as Dwight Gooden hurtled calculatedly through his first delivery of the morning. For the Mets, it can't help but be an ominous moment whenever Gooden takes the mound, and it likely will be so for the foreseeable future.
In his fourth appearance on the mound since he underwent shoulder surgery last September, Gooden worked 10 carefully calibrated and essentially uneventful minutes this morning. He unloaded strikes to Mackey Sasser and consulted regularly with his trainer and pitching coach. He then walked quickly to the clubhouse, cameras clicking wildly and television cables snaking after him. 
 "Who's the kid?" Manager Jeff Torborg asked with a smile. "Should we sign him?"
The Mets don't have much room for joking about their signing of pitchers, not after David Cone's abritration victory that awarded the right-hander $4.25 million for 1992 and that left Cone rather attractively positioned for free agency beyond that.
General Manager Al Harazin, a qualified lawyer, lost his arbitration case against Cone. But Harazin must not lose sight of what he has to do now. Having demonstrated a facility for identifying critical moments and acting aggressively and swiftly, he should forget about the posturing of negotiating and move to sign Cone.
The organization has designated the 29-year-old Cone as one of its multitalented performers worthy of a big multiyear contract, and so Harazin's statement on Tuesday that "the ball is in David's court" is precisely the kind of misguided appraoch to assume in pursuit of him.
Look at it this way: Can the Mets afford not to give Cone three additional years for $15 million if that's what it takes?
Gooden, with more than 1,700 innings of wear on his arm, declining statistics and two of the last three seasons cut short by arm trouble, can no longer be considered the ace of the staff.
Bret Saberhagen, with a history of arm problems as well as a track record that mixes the ordinary with brilliance, will no doubt be immediately useful, but it is no sure thing he is going to be an institution in New York.
Cone, with his potential and demonstrated excellence, is the club's commodity with the greatest marquee value.
Besides, Cone's price tag is going nowhere but up. With $4.25 million annually as the starting point, Cone need only put together an effective season to send it escalating considerably higher. And if one is to take the Mets at their own word -- or at their own hype -- the team is going to be better this season, and Cone's record can only profit from that.
Negotiating now as opposed to later also would eliminate the inflationary presence of other clubs.
And then there is the lesson of Frank Viola last season, which is that to permit the season to begin with free agency looming is to embark on an absolutely unpredictable and perilous path. Positions and feelings tend to harden. To lose Viola and Cone in consecutive seasons would be catastrophic.
 
Mets' Thinking May Be Off
 The Mets, though, appear willing to act as if stung by Cone's abrupt termination of talks on a long-term deal.
Maybe they believe that there will be a handful of premier pitchers to bid for next season, with Doug Drabek, Greg Maddux and John Smiley potential free agents. Maybe their payroll has become paralyzingly large.
But the only maybe that should be acceptable is that maybe Harazin should stay on his roll as general manager and get back on the phone.
 
INSIDE PITCH
 DWIGHT GOODEN on his first workout in front of pitching coach MEL STOTTLEMYRE : "Didn't do anything different and can't say anything new. It doesn't feel like it did before 1989, but it doesn't hurt." Said Stottlemyre: "I saw no signs of any flaws in the motion. He was smoother than I thought he'd be."

The retail phase of the Presidential campaign just ended abruptly. After an unusually short pre-season run, the candidates now shift from personal politicking into industrial mode. In the next three weeks, two dozen states will conduct primaries or caucuses; the candidates will need to magnify their messages with media and mailings.
New Hampshire can provide some momentum; Gary Hart's 1984 victory there probably catapulted him to his success soon after in Florida. What New Hampshire surely provides is lessons for the spring campaign: 
 Voters rewarded candor and punished Washington. Paul Tsongas derided his Democratic opponents for making irresponsible campaign promises; he's not running, he said, to be Santa Claus. Americans have to make sacrifices if they're to make the economy work again. He won a comfortable victory.
Pat Buchanan derided President Bush for breaking his celebrated promise not to raise taxes. The Granite State, where citizens refuse to tax either incomes or purchases, gave him a striking psychological victory.
The gender gap returns. George Wallace used to attract many more male than female voters; so for a long time did Ronald Reagan; in 1988, men favored George Bush, 57 to 41, while women split evenly. Tuesday, the gender gap came back with a boom in the Buchanan vote column.
The New Hampshire Republican vote divided about evenly between men and women four years ago. Why on Tuesday was it 57 percent male? Quite possibly because Mr. Buchanan brought out a flood of male independents. Consider these exit poll findings: Among independents who voted Republican, the women favored Mr. Bush, 54 to 41. But the men favored Mr. Buchanan, by a fat 56-to-42 margin.
America's attention span remains short. Three months ago, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas seemed poised to win a solid second; most people conceded first place to Paul Tsongas, a neighbor from Lowell, Mass. Two months ago, Mr. Clinton had pushed into a clean lead in the polls.
Then his campaign was struck successively by dive bombers labeled Gennifer Flowers and the draft and he fell far behind. Still, he pressed on -- and now has regained his footing by winning, after all, a solid second.
On the Republican side, meanwhile, the zigzag plunges look even steeper. Last March, the popularity of Commander in Chief George Bush shot up to 88 percent after the Persian Gulf war. Now, as the bartender said in the "Doonesbury" comic strip last Sunday, "War? What war?"
For a time early Tuesday afternoon, it looked as though Pat Buchanan might even run even with the President. Exit polls initially showed a gap much narrower than the President's ultimate 53-to-37 percent margin.
Incumbents have power, and use it. That may help explain why Mr. Bush finally won by 16 points. Andrew Rosenthal reported in The Times yesterday that the White House, alarmed by the early findings, pushed to turn out Bush voters, using phone banks that can generate 5,000 calls an hour.
In the 12th year of the Reagan-Bush reign, the Administration has many such buttons to push, and in many states at once. If the economy does not improve as the year goes on, it may have to try pushing them all. If the economy does improve, the limp lesson from New Hampshire may be no more than war? What war?

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
A Devalued Asset

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
Being the Leader of the Free World is not worth what it used to be in American politics. That was one stark message from the New Hampshire primary.
During the decades of the cold war -- and the primal American fear of Communism -- an incumbent could expect to take at least one great asset into a campaign. He was the protector of U.S. national security. 
 George Bush was the very model of the national security President. He had been the Director of Central Intelligence. In the White House he dealt on intimate terms with every important world figure. He won the Persian Gulf war.
But it availed him not in New Hampshire. Pat Buchanan, a commentator who had never run for any political office, won 37 percent of the Republican primary vote against Mr. Bush. The President's spin doctors hardly bothered to pretend that the result was anything but a humiliation for him.
Incumbent Presidents have had their troubles in New Hampshire before. In 1968 Senator Eugene McCarthy won 41.9 percent against President Johnson, and L.B.J. withdrew from the race. But Johnson had on his head a foreign-policy disaster: Vietnam. Jimmy Carter bore the burden of the Iran hostage crisis when he beat Edward Kennedy by only 47 to 37 percent in 1980. George Bush was coming off a victorious and immensely popular war against Iraq.
The threat of war used to be a major political concern. CBS/New York Times surveys over the years asked people to list "the most important problem facing this country." In the mid-1980's, many listed "war, nuclear war" -- the figure rising to 20 percent in 1985. Last month, 1 percent mentioned that as a concern.
Exit polls in New Hampshire showed a similar disregard for foreign-policy issues. One done for the four television networks asked voters to pick from a list of eight issues one or two that "mattered most in deciding how you voted."
Fewer than 10 percent of both Republicans and Democrats chose "foreign trade" or "the Persian Gulf war." A listed problem that could be considered either domestic or foreign, "U.S. ability to compete economically," was picked by 19 percent of Republican voters, 12 percent of Democrats.
Most important by far to voters in both parties was "the economy and jobs," which was picked by 48 percent of Republicans, 59 percent of Democrats. The only other issue to be mentioned by more than 25 percent of either party was "health care," checked by 36 percent of Democrats.
Those figures reinforce something we already knew. The end of the cold war has coincided with another fundamental change: the rise of doubt among Americans about their own society. It is not just personal distress about falling living standards. It is fear about the state of the country's economic and social institutions.
Pat Buchanan understood those feelings and campaigned extremely effectively on them. He painted President Bush as someone who did not know or did not care about economic pain. He even adjusted his anti-government rhetoric to come out for increased government action on behalf, for example, of the unemployed.
There was no sign that New Hampshire Republicans who voted for Mr. Buchanan were attracted by such of his extreme views as the suggestion that Jews were a major factor in pushing for the Persian Gulf war. Neither that nor other statements that have been called anti-Semitic became an issue in New Hampshire.
The larger question left by this New Hampshire primary is whether we are seeing the beginning of an American retreat from the world: a retreat into protectionism, for one thing. That possibility is a concern for our allies and friends, well expressed recently by the British columnist Peter Jenkins in The Independent.
"America is on the blink," he wrote. "It is seen this way by us because that is how too many Americans see it. At the moment of victory in what was a historic global contest, the stuffing has been knocked out of American self-confidence. The national mood is recessional in a sense that transcends the pain of the longest economic recession since the Great Depression."
The world still needs American leadership, Mr. Jenkins wrote. But before it can be reasserted, America "first must change itself."

The 1996 Campaign

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
My early prognostication still holds. Clinton gets the Democratic nomination, chooses Kerrey for V.P., and they run a respectable race; the economy turns up briskly and the Bush-Quayle ticket wins.
To check this out on the morning after New Hampshire, I called a former boss and observed how this was a great day for Old Nixon Hands. 
 "You're referring to Bush?" he asked. That was a snappy comeback for a man pushing 80, but comebacks are Mr. Nixon's thing, and he counts George Bush as well as Pat Buchanan among his old hands.
He sees the Democrats winning the Northeast and leading in California, where recession came late and will last longer. The Republicans hold the South, take the Midwest and win.
But Buchanan has exposed Bush beatability; how should the President handle him?
"He shouldn't bash Buchanan," replied Nixon, "he'll need those people. And in the end, conservatives will vote for Bush."
That is how Nixon retained support of Goldwater's people after the 1964 debacle wiped out Republicans everywhere. Nor should Bush pander to the isolationism or nativism of the movement reborn: "He's as far right as he ought to be."
That's Nixon's advice; now let me take a long look ahead on my own.
Buchanan has wounded Bush. The media-savvy slugger will be forced to split the protest vote with David Duke for a while, and it will be a long time before he sees 40 percent again. But Buchanan's anti-immigrant oratory will touch a chord of racist resentment in California.
The Republican Convention of 1992 will be a replay of 1976: The incumbent President wins, but the challenger's withdrawal speech steals the show. Buchanan will try to play challenger Reagan to Bush's President Ford: At convention's close, Buchanan will grimly endorse the ticket, with his supporters aware that he privately hopes the Republicans lose.
In the fall of 1992, we will be into the campaign of 1996. Both parties choose centrists in 1992; most of the Buchanan far right, no more than 10 percent of the electorate, casts a "clothespin vote" -- holding its nose and voting for Bush.
If Bush wins, internecine war would start early, with low Presidential ratings in a surly second term helping fan ultra-right flames. Vice President Quayle, the Bush loyalist, would be mired in the swamp of disenchantment at the end of most second terms.
Buchanan and his anti-minority minority then dust off F. Clifton White's old playbook and make their bid for an ideological coup. Back to New Hampshire, this time not to wound but to win.
What conservative -- to the right of Bush, but nowhere near the deep end -- would rally the majority of Republicans? Who would remind the primary voters of the self-indulgent folly of implosion that, last time, led inexorably to Democratic landslide, the Great Society and unwinnable war?
There is Jack Kemp, his Reaganite speeches becoming succinct as he matures; there's Gov. Pete Wilson of California, taking a beating now but sure to come back with his state; there's Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, if the South becomes the Republican redoubt.
Not one of this trio (or quartet, with Quayle) is burdened with the arrogance and elitism of Nelson Rockefeller, the Goldwater foil. But not one is building the organizational base or drafting the long-range plans to keep the party in the Eisenhower-Nixon-Reagan mainstream, out of the hands of a little band of willful extremists.
Pat Buchanan has already proved he is far more politically adept than his early idol, Barry Goldwater; he also hates harder and has more of a "movement" messianism. If his Republican coup fails in 1996, he is likely to lead his legion out into a reincarnation of the Know-Nothings -- insuring an era of Democratic dominance.
Has George Bush thought any of this through? If he cares, he will conduct his campaign and his Presidency in a way that builds the vital center of the party of the right.
Emendation to my previous column: Peter Fleming, Temporary Special Independent Counsel in the Senate's leak investigation, wants it known that he -- not Senators Ford or Stevens -- is responsible for "the decision to depose" reporters. Perhaps the Senators want to distance themselves from a blunder.

HEADLINE: Let's Wait For a Winner

BYLINE: By Bruce Babbitt; Bruce Babbitt, Governor of Arizona from 1978 to 1987, was a Democratic candidate for President in 1988.

DATELINE: PHOENIX

 BODY:
Like the Oracle of Delphi, New Hampshire's voters have spoken to us in riddles. President Bush has been savaged by a challenger who can't win. Paul Tsongas is a winner with few places to go. Gov. Bill Clinton has bounced back because Senator Bob Kerrey, an authentic war hero, can't seem to take advantage of the renewed debate over Vietnam.
The conventional wisdom among Democratic leaders is that we should unite quickly behind a nominee. The sages in Washington would like to scrub these hapless newcomers and bring in a brand name like Gov. Mario Cuomo or Senator Lloyd Bentsen. Unhappily for them, one of the few clear messages from New Hampshire, in the form of a paltry 3 percent for the New York Governor, is that voters aren't looking for candidates who sat on the sidelines when the President looked invincible. 
 New Hampshire's voters, it seems, are telling us that this campaign hasn't gone on long enough. We just don't know enough about candidates. With the exception of Jerry Brown, who was Governor of California, they are all newcomers, mostly from small states. And with the exception of Mr. Clinton, the news media haven't really subjected them to the hazing that is part of a Presidential campaign.
If the 1988 campaign was a bit too long, this one has been way too short. It started late because of Operation Desert Storm and the high approval ratings the gulf war conferred on a weak incumbent. But that's no reason to rush to judgment. This campaign should go clear to California, and even, to the convention in New York in July.
Four year ago, we slogged through Iowa and New Hampshire for months, too often sounding like Congressional candidates offering up seed catalogs full of new Federal grants. This time the candidates have learned that the economy is the issue in Presidential elections. They are finding that voters are eager for truth-telling about the effort we must make to get this country back on track.
While none of the candidates has succeeded in putting the words to music, they are shaking off the past and creating a new Democratic center that will be competitive in Presidential politics. Why should we gamble on who has the potential to put it together? They are still learning from each other. Prolonging the process will eventually produce a better nominee.
Tradition dictates that candidates bow out gracefully once they lose several primaries and the press puts them in the last paragraph of the story. It may be that the next round of primaries in South Dakota and Colorado will eliminate either Mr. Kerrey or Senator Tom Harkin. And if Mr. Clinton wins all over the South, he will certainly be on the way to the nomination. Money becomes a problem for second-tier candidates, but they don't charge to attend debates. This time, however, they owe it to their party and their country to stay in.
Remember that in the 1988 convention we lowered the percentage threshold for accruing delegates in state primaries. The rule was written for Jesse Jackson, but now it should encourage all candidates to stay in and take delegates to the convention.
This year there are more super delegates than ever. Governors, senators, Congressmen and members of the Democratic National Committee can declare their allegiance to a particular candidate at any time. It's a good concept, and they ought to stay uncommitted, remaining available to steer the convention in a different direction or to break a deadlock.
There is also another reason to keep all the Democrats in the race as long as possible. Their presence will encourage Pat Buchanan in his effort to force the President to come up with an economic plan. As long as the Democratic race continues, Republicans will be more willing to fight among themselves instead of closing ranks against an early Democratic nominee. That will be good for the country. And for the Democrats as well.

HEADLINE: How Bush Can Save Himself

BYLINE: By Edwin Meese 3d; Edwin Meese 3d, Ronald Reagan fellow in public policy at the Heritage Foundation, was Attorney General in the Reagan Administration.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The New Hampshire results are the wake-up call the Bush Administration needs. The President's political survival now demands that he return to the conservative principles on which he campaigned in 1988.
The message could not have been clearer: Washington caused the recession, and voters expect leadership that will undo the damage and put people back to work. The President must first announce a detailed economic game plan. Then he must persuade voters he intends to stick to it. 
 Getting tough with Patrick Buchanan is not the answer. Mr. Buchanan wouldn't even be in the race if the Administration hadn't abandoned policies that won the election, continuing the Reagan legacy. Instead of swatting at his challenger, the President needs to get tough with his own team.
The best way he can do that is to finish making changes in his starting lineup. He has already changed his catcher, bringing in Sam Skinner as chief of staff, and increased his batting strength, with Clayton Yeutter heading his domestic policy staff. Now it's time to replace his starting pitcher, Richard Darman, the budget director.
Mr. Darman's fingerprints on the recession are unmistakable. He persuaded Mr. Bush to abandon his campaign pledge and go along with a record tax increase in the 1990 budget deal. Today, the economy is floundering, tax revenues have declined and the deficit has mushroomed. Mr. Darman has been wrong about virtually every major economic indicator for the last two years.
Mr. Bush must also replace jumbled economic policies with a conservative philosophy that emphasizes the health of the American family and economy. Washington's unrelenting reliance on tax increases and spending reveals little sympathy for the pressures on the family. In his State of the Union Message, the President proposed modest tax relief for middle-income families, but even that promise has been shelved. He must first end the growing tax bias against families. In 1948, the average family of four paid virtually no income tax, because of the personal exemption. Today it pays an average of 24 percent of its income, as taxes and inflation have nearly annihilated the exemption.
The most direct way to provide tax relief for families is through a tax credit, a dollar for dollar reduction in taxes. Mr. Bush proposed a $1,000 tax credit for pre-school children in 1988. After three years of declining fortunes, here's a better idea: a $1,000 credit for each child between 6 and 18, and $1,500 for children under 6. Phased in over five years, this would reduce the typical family's tax burden to what it was a generation ago.
He must also press Congress to cut the capital gains tax to 15 percent. Liberals say this is a sop to the rich. Let them. This is the time for confrontation with Congress, not accommodation. The current tax of 28 percent discourages investment and job creation, as Paul Tsongas, the Democratic front-runner, readily affirms.
Other business taxes should likewise be cut. When businesses invest in new equipment, they must write off the cost over a period of years. But even modest inflation erodes the deduction's value; this discourages investment. Indexing the deductions for inflation would encourage investment.
Also helpful would be a reduction in the Social Security payroll tax -- this could be done without hurting the long-term integrity of Social Security -- as well as expanded eligibility rules for individual retirement accounts. Allowing all Americans to own I.R.A.'s would step up the flow of capital needed to generate growth.
Opponents of tax cuts say they could fuel the deficit. But not if Washington learns to control spending. Instead of allowing domestic spending to rise at 10 percent a year, as it did in fiscal 1991 and 1992, Washington should hold non-defense increases to 4 to 5 percent, slightly above inflation.
If the White House needs an economic vision, this is it. With a serious effort to curb excessive regulation and a promise to steer clear of anything that even looks like a budget "summit," the President would have a program to present to the voters. Without one, New Hampshire could be the first of many wake-up calls.

HEADLINE: Senate Votes Energy Bill, 94 to 4, Without Allowing Arctic Drilling

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 19

 BODY:
After it jettisoned a plan to drill for oil in the Arctic wildlife region, the Senate overwhelmingly passed an energy bill today intended to encourage the development of alternative-fuel vehicles and ease Federal regulations on nuclear generators and other forms of electrical power.
The highly technical legislation was sewn together by liberals who sought to conserve energy, and conservatives who hoped to stimulate more energy production. As a patchwork of proposals and amendments, it did not wholly satisfy most senators nor the White House, although it was approved by a vote of 94 to 4. 
 Secretary of Energy James D. Watkins endorsed the Senate action. "We're very pleased," he said in a brief interview after the vote. "It's a tremendous win for the consumer, the producer, the economy and jobs."
A similar energy bill is currently in committee in the House. It encourages conservation and efficiency among electric utilities and deregulates much of the production and transmission industry. Currently, however, the measure does not contain provisions like the Senate bill that would ease licensing requirements for the nuclear industry. The House bill is expected to reach the floor by the Easter recess.
The Senate energy bill was seen as a harbinger for important changes in the automobile industry, and as a promoter of solar power and other technologies. It would give modest aid to the faltering nuclear and natural gas industries by easing the licensing regulations for atomic power plants and natural gas pipelines. By setting new efficiency standards for electrical appliances and buildings, it will also affect most consumers, especially those who now have to install improved insulation in their new homes to qualify for Federally insured mortgages.
The measure is similar in a few respects to the National Energy Strategy proposed by President Bush at the time of the Persian Gulf war, which also called for increased exploitation of nuclear power and coal. But the Senate killed the centerpiece of the White House bill, which would have permitted oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a calving ground for 180,000 Alaskan caribou.
The Senate bill also includes moratoriums on oil drilling off most of the shores of New England, New Jersey, Washington state and Oregon, in contrast to the Administration proposals to accelerate oil drilling in the oceans.
The Administration, in coalition with conservative lawmakers and representatives of automobile-producing states, did succeed in holding off proposals to increase fuel-efficiency standards for cars. They argued that the auto industry could not afford to make the fuel economy adjustments while it was reeling from the recession.
Senator J. Bennett Johnston, Democrat of Louisiana and primary sponsor of the legislation, argued on the Senate floor that its partial deregulation of the electrical utility industry would "dramatically help every consumer by reducing rates considerably" while its encouragement of natural gas production would "improve the environment measurably."
Senator James M. Jeffords, Republican of Vermont, criticized the legislation for failing to establish a large market for domestically produced alternative fuels like methanol as he proposed in an amendment that was tabled by a vote of 57 to 39. "The bill falls short because we still will become increasingly dependent on oil from the Middle East," he said in an interview. "We still don't have a national energy strategy."
Mr. Jeffords decided in the final hours to vote in favor of the bill, but he said he had done so reluctantly.
With oil prices low and supplies plentiful, the legislation has received little attention outside competing environmental groups and utility associations, which lobbied hard on various provisions. President Bush reserved a single line of his State of the Union address to the energy issue, a far cry from the days when long lines at the gas pumps inspired President Carter to call the creation of an energy policy his highest domestic priority.
The most far-reaching provision of the bill strengthens the 1990 Clean Air Act by obliging most commercial and Government vehicle fleets to begin replacing their stock of light trucks and cars in 1995 with vehicles that run on natural gas, solar power cells, ethanol and electricity. Ninety percent of the non-military fleets purchased by Federal agencies would be required to use alternative fuels by the year 2000.
Another measure would ease regulations in the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 to allow independent, unregulated power companies to provide power across state lines. The intention is to ease entry of new power producers into the market.
 
Energy Producers 'Overjoyed'
 "We're overjoyed," said Merribel S. Ayres, executive director of the National Independent Energy Producers. "This will stimulate greater economic efficiency, fuel savings and environmental protection."
Daniel Becker, a lawyer for the Sierra Club, disagreed, saying that by generating more electricity, the provision would mean "burning more fossil fuels and causing more pollution."
Environmentalists also expressed concern with a measure that would streamline licensing procedures for new nuclear power plants. It would replace the current system by which the Nuclear Regulatory Commission separately licenses construction and then operation of plants with a single review procedure. Proponents of the measure said it could reduce regulatory delays by up to 10 years.
"Its going to be a great help assuming it goes all the way through the House," said Scott Peters, spokesman for the U.S. Council for Energy Awareness, a nuclear power lobbying group. "It will give the utilities the possibility to consider nuclear power. Very few utilities would undertake building a nuclear power plant under the licensing procedures of today."
An amendment offered by Senator Timothy E. Wirth, Democrat of Colorado, would set higher efficiency standards for light bulbs and electric motors in an effort to eliminate the need for an estimated 23 large power plants in the next several years. He estimated his provision would save the economy $2 billion a year.
The House's bill is currently under consideration in the Energy and Commerce Committee.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 21, 1992, Friday

 CORRECTION:
A table in Business Day yesterday summarizing the provisions of the energy bill passed by the Senate on Wednesday included one provision erroneously. The measure giving American gas producers preferential treatment in rate competition with Canadian producers was stricken from the bill before passage.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Provisions of the Senate Energy Bill"
 
Alternative fuels:
 Starting in 1995, most government and commercial vehicle fleets would be obliged to begin replacing cars and trucks with vehicles that run on alternative fuels like electricity, solar power cells and natural gas. This provision is meant to create a market for nonpolluting cars and trucks and encourage automobile makers to build more of them.
 
Nuclear energy:
 Nuclear Regulatory Commission procedures for licensing nuclear power plants would be streamlined -- a single review would replace separate licensing procedures for construction and then operation. Proponents say this could reduce regulatory delays for starting some plants by up to 10 years.
 
 Electrical energy:
 A 1935 law restricting independent utilities from carrying electricity across state lines would be repealed. By opening wholesale power generation to more competition, proponents say it will force utilities to buy electricity from more efficient producers.
 
 Natural gas:
 Regulations governing interstate natural gas pipelines would be streamlined to expedite construction. American gas producers would receive preferential treatment in rate competitition with Canadian producers.
 
 Energy efficiency:
 Manufacturers would have to make more efficient light bulbs, electric motors, air conditioners and commercial heating equipment. The bill sets minimum energy standards designed to save $2 billion in yearly energy costs.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN;
Poll of Republicans Was Off the Mark

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEDFORD, N.H., Feb. 19

 BODY:
A poll of primary voters leaving voting stations across New Hampshire on Tuesday accurately mirrored the final vote for the Democratic candidates, but was off the mark for the Republicans.
Voter Research and Surveys, a joint effort of ABC News, CBS News, CNN, and NBC News, set up the poll. 
 For the Republicans, the voter surveys throughout the afternoon and early evening showed President Bush leading Patrick J. Buchanan by the narrow margin of four to eight percentage points. But the state tally of actual ballots showed a more substantial margin for Mr. Bush of 16 percentage points: 53 percent to 37 percent.
As a result, many television newscasts in the early evening portrayed Mr. Bush's lead over Mr. Buchanan as much narrower than the final results. The New York Times, which subscribed to the voter surveys in New Hampshire, changed its headline between editions to reflect Mr. Bush's larger margin, going from "New Hampshire Rebukes Bush" to "Bush Jarred in First Primary."
Warren J. Mitofsky, executive director of Voter Reseach and Surveys, said the Republican primary poll had the worst discrepancy he had ever experienced in any exit poll. He said no clear reason for the discrepancy had been determined.

How the Survey Was Conducted
The Election Day exit poll is based on questionnaires completed by voters as they left voting stations throughout New Hampshire on Tuesday.
The poll was conducted by Voter Research and Surveys, an organization created in 1990 by ABC News, CBS News, CNN and NBC News.
The results are based on 1,917 voters in 60 randomly selected precincts who voted in the Democratic primary, and on 1,848 voters in 60 precincts who voted in the Republican primary.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results from such polls, when based on the entire sample, should differ by no more than 3 percentage points, in either direction, from what would have been obtained by seeking to interview all Democratic or Republican primary voters who turned out on Election Day in New Hampshire.
Results based on smaller subgroups have a larger potential sampling error. In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of voter opinion on Election Day may introduce other sources of error into the poll.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Victor;
TSONGAS MAKES BID TO WIDEN SUPPORT

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT

 BODY:
Paul E. Tsongas, the Democratic winner of the New Hampshire primary, began an intense search yesterday for the money and votes he needs to take his campaign beyond New England.
The former Senator from Massachusetts had a private fund-raising event and rally in Baltimore, then three fund-raising events with the Greek-Americans yesterday evening in Astoria and Brooklyn. 
 Mr. Tsongas, who for the first time in his 10-month quest for the Democratic Presidential nomination had a campaign plane, told reporters that it was critical for him to do well in Maine, South Dakota and Maryland.
A victory in these states, he said, "can get us to the next tier," because they are small enough to do the kind of one-on-one voter campaigning that has marked his campaign. Winning these states would enhance his fund-raising ability, he said.
 
'We Need Money'
 "We got $50,000 in unsoliticed funds yesterday," said Mr. Tsongas, who likes to brag that his campaign was outspent six to one by that of Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, who came in second in the primary.
"We need the money," to take his economic message to voters with television commercials instead of the 85-page booklet he has been using, Mr. Tsongas told reporters on his plane. With money, he said, "we can reduce the book to 30 seconds."
Maryland will be the first test of Mr. Tsongas's appeal in the South or a border state. He appeared to do well with a crowd of supporters here at a rally in Hopkins Plaza, where he gave his stump speech of economic and generational responsibility.
One supporter gave him an oar.
"I think we've found our campaign symbol," Mr. Tsongas said, lifting the oar in the air. Mr. Tsongas often likens America's present economic situation to that of a crew standing in a boat and bashing one another with oars while German and Japanese rivals row together with precision.
In the evening at the Crystal Place in Astoria, nearly 2,000 people jammed into a ballroom to see him. Nearly 5,000 others stood in the street to meet him. Inside there were more chants of his name and people hoisted banners, one of which said, "Paul Tsongas: They called Clark Kent mild mannered, but we know better."
Michael Chronos, a real estate broker, said he was sure that Mr. Tsongas would be President in November. "He has the guts to go after Bush," he said.
Mr. Tsongas then went to a Greek Orthodox church in Brooklyn where he was met by another crowd and chants of "Tsongas, Tsongas, Tsongas."

HEADLINE: Consumer Prices Rose Only 0.1% Last Month

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 19

 BODY:
Consumer prices rose one-tenth of a percent in January, the Government said today, heralding what economists say could prove to be the least inflationary period in a generation.
The Labor Department credited falling energy costs and a drop in food prices for the good showing in its Consumer Price Index last month. 
 Yet even with these sectors excluded, prices were up a modest three-tenths of 1 percent. Economists tend to favor this so-called core rate since food and energy often gyrate for weather and other reasons that do not reflect business activity.
"This confirms that inflation pressures are abating," said Bruce Steinberg, a Merrill Lynch economist. "I think that will continue to be the picture for all of this year and probably for a chunk of next year as well."
Consumer prices in 1991 rose 3.1 percent, the smallest gain in five years. The January increase, if it held steady for 12 months, would result in an annual rate of inflation of nine-tenths of 1 percent.
While economists are not forecasting a performance that good, they do expect inflation to be tame for the whole year.
Inflation generally wanes during periods of economic decline. And it usually does not pick up until recoveries are well under way.
The January price advance, which matched a rise of one-tenth of 1 percent in July, followed a revised December gain of two-tenths of a percent. The Government had originally reported an increase of three-tenths of a percent in December.
In a separate report today, the Labor Department said inflation-adjusted earnings fell seven-tenths of a percent in January. It was the worst drop in three months and was caused primarily by a drop of six-tenths of a percent in average weekly hours worked by non-farm production workers.
The January rise in prices of one-tenth of a percent reflected the fact that energy costs fell for the first time since July, by 1.5 percent.
That drop included a 1.9 percent fall in gasoline costs, which left pump prices 18.1 percent below their peak level reached in November 1990 after Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait.
The cost of home heating oil declined for a second consecutive month, dropping 5.5 percent in January and now stands 31.3 percent below the 1990 peak.
Food prices dropped by four-tenths of a percent, their first decline since August. The decline was led by a 7.1 percent fall in the cost of fresh fruits and vegetables.
Used-car prices were down 1.1 percent while new car prices edged up one-tenth of a percent. The increase, however, was more than offset by a 2.4 percent drop in auto financing charges, which because of falling interest rates are now 9.5 percent below where they were a year ago.
Clothing prices, which had fallen 1.1 percent in December, posted an advance of three-tenths of a percent in January.
The various changes left the Consumer Price Index, before adjusting for seasonal variations, at 138.1, compared with 134.6 a year ago. That meant that a market basket of goods costing $134.60 in January 1990 would have cost $138.10 last month.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Pennsylvania;
Trouble Shadows Specter in Senate Race

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Feb. 20

 BODY:
Last November, when for the first time in 30 years Pennsylvanians elected a Democrat to the United States Senate, politicians across the country took note. Now, with the political landscape here still rumbling from Senator Harris Wofford's landslide victory over former Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, the state's Republican Senator, Arlen Specter, is running for re-election to a third term.
While Mr. Specter is way ahead of the pack of candidates jockeying for positions in the April 28 primaries here, political analysts say he is increasingly vulnerable because of the long recession, the voters' anti-incumbent mood and a ballot headed by a President whose re-election efforts are having serious problems. 
 Mr. Specter, a onetime Democrat with one of the most liberal voting records of any Republican in the Senate, has also alienated some of his supporters. Conservatives still criticize him for voting against Judge Robert H. Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court in 1987, and many women were outraged by his prosecutorial grilling of Prof. Anita F. Hill in Judge Clarence Thomas's nomination hearings last October.
Making matters worse for the Senator is that the election year opened with the star of a popular movie, "J.F.K.," calling him a liar and ridiculing him by name.
Mr. Specter, who served as an assistant counsel to the Warren Commission, called the movie "absurd" and said it "mangled the facts on the single-bullet theory" that he devised. Mr. Specter was the first to rule out a conspiracy by theorizing that one bullet killed President John F. Kennedy and wounded the Texas Governor, John B. Connally Jr. Many experts on the assassination say the theory strains credulity, but it has never been disproved.
So far more than 525,000 Pennsylvanians have seen Oliver Stone's movie, in which the actor Kevin Costner, playing the role of Jim Garrison, the former New Orleans District Attorney, refers to Mr. Specter as "an ambitious junior counselor" who perpetuated "one of the grossest lies ever forced on the American people."
The brief mention of Mr. Specter's name in the movie draws applause or shouts from detractors in theaters across the state. At some theater exits campaign workers for his opponent in the primary, Stephen F. Freind, hand out leaflets that try to raise more doubts about Mr. Specter's record.
Mr. Specter refuses to address what he calls his opponent's "scurrilous charges," and has joined other members of Congress in calling for the release of sealed documents relating to investigations of the assassination.
But some political analysts believe the 62-year-old Senator may be heading for trouble.
"Arlen Specter is perilously close to becoming the issue in this race, and being put irretrievably on the defensive," said Michael L. Young, a professor of politics and public affairs at Pennsylvania State University in Harrisburg. "And one of the most reliable axioms in modern politics is that if you become the issue in the race, the race is over and you lose."
So far, Mr. Specter dominates his potential opponents when it comes to name recognition, political support, campaign finances and organization.
In the Republican primary Mr. Specter, who recently won the party's nearly unanimous endorsement, faces Mr. Freind, whose name is pronounced like the word "friend," an eight-term State Representative from a suburb of Philadelphia. Mr. Freind, 47, is best known as the main promoter of an anti-abortion law that is now being considered by the United States Supreme Court.
 
Three Democratic Contenders
 The Democratic candidates are Lieut. Gov. Mark S. Singel, who is running against the wishes of the Governor, Robert P. Casey; Robert Colville, a five-term District Attorney of Allegheny County, and Lynn Yeakel, a 51-year-old fund-raiser for women's organizations who lives in a Philadelphia suburb. The Democratic Party has endorsed Mr. Singel.
If it is clear that Mr. Specter has political problems, it is unclear how deep they go.
"A lot of women are angry about Arlen Specter's performance during the Thomas hearings, but this isn't the time to indulge our anger because we need his leadership in the Senate on women's issues," said Elizabeth Hrenda-Roberts, executive director of Planned Parenthood, Pennsylvania Affiliates.
Mr. Freind has raised little money but says he has about 5,000 volunteers from the state's anti-abortion movement. Senator Specter and the three Democratic candidates support a woman's right to choose abortion.
Many conservatives are also angry at Mr. Specter who, according to the American Conservative Union, votes with conservatives only 34 percent of the time.
"His Bork vote weighs very heavily against him, but the way he conducted the Thomas hearings has relieved most of that stigma," said James O. Pickard, a Republican from Lancaster who is a leader of the party's conservative wing. "Arlen Specter also has strong positions on law enforcement, anti-gun control and economic development."
Mr. Specter says he knows his campaign has some trouble spots. "I see a lot of red flags," he said in an interview. "But there are too many problems in this country for me to become the issue."
While the Senator did not officially begin his campaign until Feb. 10, in a sense he has been campaigning nonstop for the last 11 years. He often criss-crosses the state, visiting each of Pennsylvania's 67 counties every two years, and has held more than 400 "town meetings." He has also raised more than $5 million, and expects to spend more than $7.5 by November.
Mr. Specter's tireless style of campaigning comes from a 25-year political career in which he lost as many races as he won. He was born in Wichita, Kan., graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Pennsylvania, served in the Air Force and, at Yale Law School, was editor of the Yale Law Journal.
He worked as an assistant district attorney in Philadelphia and, at the age of 35, began his political career as District Attorney of Philadelphia. He ran unsucessfully for mayor in 1967 before winning a second term as District Attorney in 1969.
He then skidded through a series of defeats, losing a third term as District Attorney in 1973, a senatorial primary in 1976 and a primary for the governorship in 1978. A year later his wife, Joan, won a seat on the Philadelphia City Council, where she still serves. Mr. Specter narrowly won the 1980 election to the Senate and was re-elected by a comfortable margin in 1986.
The Specters have two sons -- Stephen, 31, a college teacher in California, and Shanin, 34, a lawyer in Philadelphia who is an adviser to his father's campagin.
David L. Buffington, who last fall was the first political analyst to predict that Mr. Wofford would defeat Mr. Thornburgh, a former Governor of Pennsylvania, said there would be no upset this year. "Democrats are divided, Specter will out-spend everybody, and he works and he works and he works," Mr. Buffington said.

HEADLINE: Doctors in Connecticut Resist Cancer Center Satellite Plans

BYLINE: By ANDREW L. YARROW

 BODY:
There may be no bigger name in cancer treatment than Sloan-Kettering, but doctors in Danbury, Conn., are far from pleased about a plan by the Manhattan hospital to build its first satellite treatment center there.
The issue, ostensibly, is how best to serve cancer patients in southern New England. Officials at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center say the area needs a new outpatient center to provide radiation therapy. 
 But oncologists at Danbury Hospital, whose cancer-treatment center is just a mile from the site of Sloan-Kettering's proposed $2.5 million clinic, see the matter differently.
They say that Sloan-Kettering, like an increasing number of prominent hospitals throughout the country, is trying to establish a beachhead in a well-to-do area for economic reasons, both for the income from treatments at the satellite clinic and to direct more patients to its main hospital in Manhattan.
"It's like an advertising schema to funnel patients to their parent corporation," said Dr. Martin Abrams, a medical oncologist in private practice in Danbury. "It's really not necessary and it can adversely affect treatment at Danbury Hospital."
Hospital officials and doctors from the Sun Belt to Northeastern suburbs say that Sloan-Kettering's efforts are emblematic of a national trend in which prominent urban hospitals establish income-generating satellites beyond the cities or regions that they have traditionally served.
 
Mayo Clinic Is a Pioneer
 These have taken the form of outpatient clinics, joint ventures with group practices of doctors and affiliations with community hospitals that provide the main hospital with a new pool of patients in exchange for lending its prestige and expertise in medical specialties like oncology.
The Mayo Clinic, based in Rochester, Minn., has been a pioneer in developing satellite health-care centers. It opened one in Jacksonville, Fla., in 1986, and another in Scottsdale, Ariz., the following year. The two locations were chosen "because of the population base," said Michael O'Hara, a clinic spokesman, who acknowledged that the clinic's strategy was to go to communities with growing numbers of elderly residents.
Most of the hospitals that have established satellites are in large cities, where their pool of paying patients has declined in recent years and their financial base has been further eroded by caps on Medicare reimbursement imposed during the 1980's. Although these hospitals say their satellites are being placed in areas that need health-care providers, many officials say that the branches are being set up in areas with large elderly populations like Florida and Arizona, or in affluent suburbs.
 
Networks of Clinics
 This highly competitive franchising of health care by hospitals is occurring while for-profit health-care companies and health-maintenance organizations have been establishing national and regional networks of clinics. The picture is further complicated, health officials say, by the branching out of hospitals to provide home health-care services and operate nursing homes. In addition, group medical practices have begun competing with hospitals by buying sophisticated, expensive diagnostic and treatment machines.
In addition to the Mayo Clinic's Jacksonville satellite, in Florida alone the Cleveland Clinic Foundation has developed a satellite in Fort Lauderdale; the M. D. Anderson Medical Center in Houston has established a cancer-treatment center with the Orlando Regional Medical Center, and Duke University Hospital has allied itself with the Walt Disney Company and the Florida Hospital Medical Center to develop its own satellite in Orlando, according to Charles Pierce, the president of the Florida Hospital Association.
One strategy for hospitals to increase their pool of prospective patients has been to develop regional networks. The Fox Chase Medical Center in Philadelphia, for example, has developed a network of nine affiliated hospitals as far afield as Harrisburg and Trenton.
Such satellites, however, have rarely been established without inciting fierce local opposition. Many hospital officials and doctors use words like "poaching" and "incursions" to describe the satellites.
 
Doctors Vow a Boycott
 When the Cleveland Clinic came to Fort Lauderdale, for example, the medical staffs at nearby Broward General Medical Center and Holy Cross Hospital vowed to boycott it. The Federal Trade Commission filed suit, charging that the doctors were violating antitrust laws, and the matter was only settled earlier this month when Broward's chief of staff signed a series of consent agreements, pledging not to take any concerted action against the Cleveland Clinic.
In Connecticut, Sloan-Kettering had tried to establish a cancer-treatment center in Stamford several years ago, only to drop its plan amid opposition from doctors and administrators at St. Joseph Medical Center and Stamford Hospital. Similar sentiments have now surfaced at Danbury Hospital and at the Yale Comprehensive Cancer Center in New Haven.
"We believe our region of responsibility is the entire state of Connecticut," said Alan Sartorelli, the director of the Yale center, which, like Sloan-Kettering, is one of 28 American hospitals designated by the National Cancer Institute as a cancer-treatment center. "Sloan-Kettering is an excellent cancer center, with top-notch patient care," he said, "but the question is whether there's really a need."
Dr. David Berger, the chief of radiation oncology at Danbury Hospital, is more blunt. "We feel this represents a duplication of services and offers no improvement in the quality of care that we provide," he said.
Danbury Hospital already has a radiation-therapy program with one linear accelerator, and earlier this month it requested state approval to install a second. The Danbury Hospital plan, which had been in the works since last summer, was announced just two weeks after Sloan-Kettering filed its proposal in January.
Sloan-Kettering officials say that doctors in the Danbury area approached them to develop an outpatient center. They said such a center would make it easier for their patients from southern New England to receive treatment closer to their homes.
"The reason for this is demographics," said Dr. Thomas J. Fahey, the deputy physician in chief at Sloan-Kettering, who is overseeing development of the new center. "Western Connecticut is underserved by radiotherapy, but it has a large group of oncologists who refer patients to us for radiation therapy or surgery."
Sloan-Kettering officials estimate that about 40 percent of their patients come from outside New York City, with most of those from New England. They estimate that the center would be able to serve up to 300 patients a year.
Sloan-Kettering's project would be affiliated with the Western Connecticut Medical Center, an adjacent medical oncology group practice, and would open next year if it receives state approval. The center would be staffed by several radiation oncologists, four technicians, a nurse and an administrator, Dr. Fahey said.
Last year, Danbury Hospital treated almost 470 cancer patients on its linear accelerator and doctors project that the hospital's cancer patient load will increase to 700 by 1994. They pointedly note that the hospital also has other machines for treating cancer patients, like a magnetic-resonance imager and a flow cytometer, that the Sloan-Kettering center would not have. In addition, the hospital has also proposed a bone-marrow transplant program that would further enhance their cancer-treatment abilities, Dr. Berger said.
"We agree that a second accelerator is needed in this area," Dr. Berger said. "But we strongly believe that it should be hospital-based."
State health officials said they needed to review both plans, but they also said that southwestern Connecticut is hardly short of cancer-treatment centers.
"We don't need to have something like that if there are five other centers in the area doing the same thing," said Marcia Schonberger, a spokeswoman for the State Commission on Hospitals and Health Care, referring to the Sloan-Kettering proposal. "They have to prove to us that there's a market."
Radiation-therapy centers exist in Stamford, Waterbury, Bridgeport, Norwalk and Torrington. Statewide, there are at least 30, Ms. Schonberger said.
Dr. Berger dismissed the idea that Sloan-Kettering was motivated by the desire to provide care in underserved areas.
"We send maybe one percent of our patients to Sloan-Kettering for specialized treatment that is unavailable here," he said. "But the areas that they have been targeting, like Stamford and Danbury, are well served. One could question why they are not going into areas less well-served like White Plains or the South Bronx."

HEADLINE: Resurgent D'Amato Runs Against Spectrum of Foes

BYLINE: By LINDSEY GRUSON

 BODY:
Emerging from the two-year-long shadow of a Senate ethics investigation, a newly confident Alfonse M. D'Amato is running hard for re-election, campaigning against a stable of incumbent villains that sometimes even includes his fellow Republican, President Bush.
Anticipating a far-tougher battle than in 1986, Mr. D'Amato is embracing a typically in-your-face strategy as he travels the state on an ever-quickening campaign schedule. With recessionary anxiety as his weapon, he is seeking to turn his political liabilities into political strengths to show that he can be both consummate politician and consummate independent operator at the same time. 
 One minute he is Mr. Inside: he boasts about his skill in navigating the Capital's arcane corridors and, reminding groups that he is often called "Senator Pothole," promises to fight for their concerns.
 
'Can't Be in Lockstep'
 At the next, he is Mr. Outside, riding the anti-incumbent tide that embarrassed the President in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday. With trademark political chutzpah, he skips over his decade of Washington service and portrays himself as the underdog, a little guy battling powerful interests and a wasteful system that does not care a hoot for the middle class. In the nasal Long Island twang that symbolizes his disregard for political politesse, he criticizes Mr. Bush, his Cabinet and their budget.
And yesterday, two days after Mr. Bush's political awakening at the hands of Patrick J. Buchanan in New Hampshire, the Senator said he would continue to criticize the President when he felt he had to.
"You can't be in lockstep," he said in an interview. "I'm going to work to get the President re-elected, but that doesn't mean I have to march in lockstep. If I see my President, the leader of our country, do something wrong, I have an obligation to fight. Sometimes you have to say we can do things better."
He said Mr. Bush had failed to propose a strong economic recovery program, to cap Federal spending and to provide the same strong leadership at home that he had shown in the Middle East.
Mr. D'Amato has been sounding these themes regularly in recent weeks, seeking to establish his political independence, even from a President whom he supports and who supports him.
"I buck the system," the Senator said while on a recent campaign swing through upstate New York. "I've always been an outsider. I'm not afraid to take on a failed policy. People don't want a rubber stamp. They want somebody to fight for them even if it means taking on the big guys. And if that means taking on some of the failed policies of the Administration or Congress, I'm not afraid to do it."
"We appreciate all the advice we get," said Torie Clarke, press secretary for the Bush-Quayle campaign. "We think the campaign is going pretty well."
Not that the Senator restricts his criticism. In addition to the Bush Administration and "the Butcher of Baghdad," the Senator's fast-draw vernacular for Saddam Hussein, Mr. D'Amato skewers Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, New York's State Legislature, "ultraliberals" seeking the Democratic nomination to oppose him, welfare cheats and the "turkeys" in Congress.
This same outsider-and proud-of-it sensibility was Mr. D'Amato's political anthem in 1980, when he challenged what he called "the institution," Senator Jacob K. Javits, and won the 1980 Republican Senate nomination by one percentage point. And after intimidating the strongest Democrats into staying out of the 1986 race, Mr. D'Amato swept to a second term with a 16 percentage-point margin over Mark Green. But that was the high point.
His approval ratings have plunged almost without interruption since the 1986 election. Only one in three voters approved of his work in a September poll taken by the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion, an independent public-opinion group. Five years previously, by contrast, almost two out of three voters said he was doing a good job. That has led five Democrats to fight for the change to oppose him.
But Mr. D'Amato is now confident that he holds the important trumps. The Senate ethics committee six months ago cleared him of most misconduct charges that had shadowed him like an albatross for two years. While his name has been linked to continuing Federal investigations, the Senator notes he is not a known target of any of the inquiries and is convinced he can deflect any questions about his ethics.
 
Money Pouring In
 He has no Republican opposition, and money is pouring in to his campaign faster than in 1986, when he spent $12 million in one of the most expensive Senate races in history. At last count, he already had raised about $4 million, more than all his Democratic contenders combined.
So far, he is concentrating on preaching to the converted in an effort to fortify his base and expand his war chest.
"I didn't win any votes here," he said after dropping in on the Conservative Political Action Conference in Albany. "These are the people who have been supportive and want to know if I appreciate it. These are the gladiators who are looked at with great scorn. They want to know: are you still one of us? This is letting them know they're part of a team and that we've got a battle in front of us."
But the Senator confronts a paradox, said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute. Mr. D'Amato's principal advantage in the general election campaign is his incumbency and his reputation as a battler for parochial interests. "But the more he trumpets his strengths, the more he reminds people, especially those who are dissatisfied, of his weaknesses," Mr. Miringoff said. "So the race becomes a referendum on his incumbency."
The Senator has responded to the conundrum with trademark daring in what amounts to his in-your-face campaign strategy. He is unabashedly seeking to use anxiety about the recession to turn his political liabilities into political strengths, to show that what some might deride as parochialism or worse is actually constituent service at its best.
"I'm back in fighting shape," he says. "It's fun again. It's fun coming out from under.
 
'Walking on Pogo Sticks'
 Republican strategists say they see a rejuvenated Senator. "He kind of looks like he's walking on Pogo sticks," said Jonathan Bush, the President's brother and the co-chairman of an coming fund-raiser for Mr. D'Amato. "There's a spring in his step and he's a happier-looking man."
The President's advisers see a D'Amato victory as vital in maintaining enough votes to sustain Presidential vetoes and have assured the Senator and his staff that Mr. Bush will make a determined effort in New York. "He's a refreshing image for the U.S. Senate and an important one for the Republican Party to preserve," said Richard N. Bond, a senior adviser to the Bush campaign and the Republican National Committee.
Out on the trail, the Senator boasts about his skill in navigating the Capital's legislative corridors and promises to lend that talent to almost any cause. On his upstate campaign swing, the Senator flew to Syracuse and drove through a punishing snowstorm to Geneva, N.Y., to attend a rally in support of the nearby Seneca Army depot, a likely target of defense cuts. Mr. D'Amato was greeted by a roar as he entered the rally. In a practiced move, he whipped off his jacket and slipped a pro-Army basesweat shirt over his shirt and tie by the time he reached the stage.
"You're going to have me with you and fighting for you and we're going to win," he thunders while drawing several standing ovations.
Mr. D'Amato decries criticism that he does not see the forest for the trees and fought for piddling programs that promised political payoffs while failing to oppose policies that cost the state billions of Federal dollars.
 
Early Critic of Noriega
 He seeks to show he has been a national voice by noting that he was an early and consistent critic of the former Panamanian leader, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and "The Butcher of Baghdad" and criticizes the President for supporting them too long. He also emphasises his work fighting against drugs and for the Baltic states' independence movements, even though that led to conflicts with the Bush and Reagan Administrations.
But he is most passionate in denouncing "welfare cheats," state policies that have turned New York into a "welfare Cadillac," and Congress. "We've got some real turkeys up there," he says.
 The Senator is still spending time schmoozing with his base constituencies in an effort to dig out campaign themes. But he already has begun to try to deflect charges that he bears any reponsibility for the state's dire financial crisis by blaming Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and the State Legislature, even though the Senate is controlled by fellow Republicans. New York's problem has not been Federal cutbacks, he says, but what he considers Mr. Cuomo's voracious tax increases and the state's unrestrained spending.
"I resent it when the Governor says it's Washington's fault," Mr. D'Amato said. "But spending is out of control. It's like trying to support a crack addict. New York is just addicted to spending, and you have to break that addiction. An addict needs more and more and eventually it dies. I'm not going to stand for this buck-passing."

HEADLINE: Senators Challenge Pentagon's War Scenarios

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 20

 BODY:
Several members of the Senate Armed Services Committee today challenged some of the potential foreign conflicts that the Defense Department has envisioned to help the military services plan their budgets through the end of the decade.
After a hearing with Adm. David E. Jeremiah, who is the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, several senators cast doubt on the likelihood of United States involvement in the seven possible wars outlined in internal Pentagon planning documents. 
 The classified scenarios, disclosed in press reports this week, are the first detailed military plans drafted by the United States for the post-cold-war era. Significant levels of military spending would be required well into the next century to sustain forces capable of fighting and winning one or more of the seven hypothetical conflicts.
Some senators expressed concern today that the Defense Department might be exaggerating some potential threats to justify robust military spending and to shield the Pentagon from future spending cuts.
"Some of these scenarios are incredibly unlikely," Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, said in an interview. "If they are used for budget rationale, they could undermine the strength of the Pentagon's budget request."
Among the hypothetical threats are another Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, a North Korean attack on South Korea and an attack on Lithuania by Russia.
"We can see through these scenarios," Senator John W. Warner of Virginia, the ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee, said in an interview. "I don't think Congress should put limits on their hypothetical planning, but then we have a right to be critical of them."
Admiral Jeremiah, the military's second-ranking officer and head of the Pentagon working group that prepared the list, defended the planning as an essential guide to help the services shape their forces and budgets, in this case for the years 1994 through 1999.
"The question for the services really is, are you prepared to deal with scenarios like these, and if so, what kind of shortfalls in munitions or spare parts might you expect," he said.
The planning outlined in the documents -- described as "illustrative" and "not predictive " -- does not mean that any of the scenarios are imminent or inevitable, and Admiral Jeremiah stressed that it would be wrong to describe them as contingencies.
Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who is chairman of the committee, said the Pentagon had refused to give the documents to the committee. Admiral Jeremiah cited the classified status of the files, although the Pentagon frequently gives committees classified documents.
Senator Nunn said the refusal put senators in the awkward position of making decisions on military spending without the same information available to The New York Times, which first reported on the documents.
"We're in the position of demanding it now," Mr. Nunn said. "We're entitled to anything The New York Times gets."
 
Analyzing the Budget
 The Senate hearing was the main event in a day of developments that could affect the Pentagon's proposed $281 billion budget for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.
The Congressional Budget Office released a study concluding that the $180 billion in Pentagon spending cuts announced last year would ultimately increase economic growth if the savings are used to reduce the budget deficit.
The study found that if the money is used to reduce the deficit, the Pentagon cuts would increase output by about $50 billion a year, or six-tenths of 1 percent, by pushing down interest rates and thus spurring investment.

HEADLINE: REGIONAL LEADERS SEEK HAITI MEETING

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH

DATELINE: KINGSTON, Jamaica, Feb. 20

 BODY:
Caribbean leaders gathered here for regional summit talks said today that they would seek a meeting of foreign ministers of the Organization of American States in Washington to consider stronger measures to restore Haiti's democratically elected Government.
Among the measures are an economic blockade and joint military intervention, leaders at the Caribbean Community meeting said. 
 Heads of government and senior officials of many of the region's island nations expressed strong displeasure in their talks this week with the unilateral decision last month by the United States to relax a commercial embargo against Haiti that had been unanimously adopted by the Organization of American States. The organization approved the embargo in October, a week after a coup by the Haitian military ousted the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide as President.
Washington has defended its decision to loosen the embargo as a humanitarian measure to alleviate suffering and prevent the destruction of the Haitian economy.
Some members of the community said they hoped that a strong signal from nations in the Americas would prompt the United States to reconsider its decision. But several of the Caribbean leaders said they would support the use of multilateral force, if necessary, to restore Haiti's elected Government.
"The best course of action right now might be an international peacekeeping force and some kind of international administrative force to go in and organize the society," said Prime Minister Lynden Pindling of the Bahamas.
But leaders of some Caribbean countries said they could never support intervention in Haiti.
"Invasion? No, never," said Prime Minister George Price of Belize.

Aristide Meeting Is Planned
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Feb. 20 (AP) -- Rene Theodore, who has been proposed as a compromise Prime Minister, is to meet with Father Aristide on Friday in Washington in an effort to untangle Haiti's political crisis. They plan to meet at the offices of the Organization of American States, which supports a plan under which Mr. Theodore would become Prime Minister and work for the restoration of democracy and Father Aristide's return.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Republicans;
Bush Allies Told Not to Attack Buchanan in Georgia, the Next Battleground

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 20

 BODY:
President Bush's re-election strategists told the campaign's supporters in Georgia today to refrain from attacking Patrick J. Buchanan, the insurgent Republican in this spring's primary races, even as the White House signaled that it would make Mr. Buchanan's record a campaign issue.
The move in Georgia hinted at indecision among the strategists as to whether Mr. Bush can secure his party's nomination quickly without using negative political tactics that would anger Mr. Buchanan's conservative backers. 
 It also suggested that they remain confident that the President's major campaign themes -- that he cares about economic problems and has the best program to cure them -- need little tinkering in the aftermath of Tuesday's strong showing by Mr. Buchanan in New Hampshire.
Georgia, the first of eight Southern states that hold Republican primaries next month, is viewed as the next major battleground for Mr. Bush and Mr. Buchanan. The Georgia primary is on March 3.
Mr. Buchanan is expected to use the same kind of slashing political attacks on the President that drew 37 percent of the Republican vote in New Hampshire this week and underscored the weakness in Mr. Bush's political support. Some analysts have claimed that Mr. Bush's failure to respond in kind contributed to his relatively slim victory there.
In the South, Mr. Bush's advisers believe that a more prosperous economy will help the President avoid an embarrassment like this week's vote. On Wednesday they called New Hampshire an "aberration," saying the economic hardship spurred voters to back Mr. Buchanan as a protest against all of the Government's leadership, not Mr. Bush in particular.
Those advisers contend that the President is strong in Georgia and has an excellent chance to sweep through the South without another strong Buchanan showing. That would allow an uncontested victory in California, the big state in which Mr. Bush is considered politically vulnerable and the single most important state in the November general election.
But other Republican political advisers said today that a sustained attack by Mr. Buchanan could seriously injure Mr. Bush in Georgia, where the economy has sagged, and even in Texas, Mr. Bush's adopted home state and the victim of an economic downturn over much of the last three years.
"The expectations for Buchanan in Texas are lower, and I think Buchanan feels he can do damage there," said one Republican strategist who does not work for Mr. Bush. "And remember, it was Bush's home state when he lost it to Bentsen" -- a reference to Mr. Bush's failed race in 1970 against the current senior Senator from Texas, Lloyd Bentsen.
To again underestimate Mr. Buchanan's potential, one of Mr. Bush's campaign officials said today, would be a grave mistake. "If he goes one or two more states after Georgia and has to put up with a 35 percent, 37 percent showing" from Mr. Buchanan, "he is dead," the official said of Mr. Bush, adding, "He will be like Jerry Ford was in 1976 -- mortally wounded, and bleeding from every part of his body."
At the White House today, Mr. Bush's deputy spokeswoman said the campaign is "certainly going to take a more aggressive approach" to Mr. Buchanan's candidacy now by defining the differences on issues between him and the President.
Charles Black, the senior adviser to Mr. Bush's campaign, said in an interview today that the campaign "has no plan to unload on him right now," but added: "Our intention is to respond and not let it go unanswered this time. It depends on what he does."
Other officials in the White House and in Mr. Bush's national and Georgia campaigns said the President would shun an assault on his opponent for now. In his first major opportunity, a speech on Friday to Republican leaders in South Carolina, Mr. Bush is expected to refer to some issues on which he and Mr. Buchanan part ways, such as protectionism, but to refrain from any outright attacks.
As expected, the White House said Mr. Bush would visit a number of Southern primary states in the next two weeks, including stops in Georgia, Texas, Florida, Alabama and probably Tennessee and Mississippi.
The President is scheduled to open his Maryland campaign in suburban Washington on Monday, and will make a six-day trek through California, Texas and Georgia next week.

HEADLINE: Japan's U.S. Investing Cut

 BODY:
Japanese investment in United States real estate tumbled to $5 billion last year, according to a report released yesterday by the accounting firm of Kenneth Leventhal & Company.
Within the context of earlier Leventhal reports, the 1991 investment figure represents a 61 percent decline from the 1990 level of $13 billion. 
 The report noted that Japanese investors are having some of the same problems that are besetting American financial institutions and developers and that low-cost capital is less abundant in Tokyo today than a few years ago.
The downturn in the domestic commercial property markets account for much of the decline, but the Persian Gulf war, the recession, and the financial shocks that Tokyo felt over the course of 1991 also contributed.

HEADLINE: Bond Swap Announced By M.A.C.

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
In a move that will produce more money for New York City officials to argue over as they seek to ease their fiscal problems, the state's Municipal Assistance Corporation said yesterday that it would raise $100 million by swapping some of its old bonds for new notes with lower interest rates.
The new refinancing will bring to $1 billion the total amount that the city might be able to tap from the assistance corporation over the next several years. But its chairman, Felix G. Rohatyn, said it was too soon to say how and whether the money could be spent, adding that the M.A.C. would be reviewing the city's budget plans before approving any aid. 
 City officials have been seeking various forms of help from the M.A.C. for months, and the new money would make them just that much more dependent on the largesse of Mr. Rohatyn, who has dominated the city's financial affairs since the corporation was set up to borrow money on its behalf in the fiscal crisis of the 1970's. Interest and principal on the M.A.C. bonds is paid using part of the city's sales tax revenues, so when the M.A.C. saves money, the city can, too.
Or as Mr. Rohatyn told the corporation's board of directors with some understatement yesterday, the extra $100 million will "meaningfully increase our popularity."
 
School Construction
 Mr. Rohatyn also made clear that he, too, has ideas for how the money might be spent, possibly using some to pay for school construction programs that the city proposes to cut to save money. The Mayor, the Governor and Mr. Rohatyn would ultimately have to agree on any use for the money, and if Mr. Rohatyn did not like it, by law he could simply use the surplus to pay off M.A.C. bonds.
What has come to be known as "the M.A.C. money" is two separate potential sources of cash. The first is $700 million that the city has proposed to raise over the next four years through a complex transaction that would amount to borrowing money to help pay for operating expenses while it cuts the work force and shrinks government costs. This is unaffected by yesterday's announcement. It calls for the city to sell new bonds, using the proceeds to buy back some old city bonds now held by the M.A.C. The corporation could then use the money it got to pay interest on its own bonds, thus freeing some sales tax revenues, which could be used by the city to help meet expenses.
But because the tight laws imposed in the 70's forbid borrowing to meet operating costs, Mr. Rohatyn has said he will not cooperate without assurances from the State Financial Control Board and bond-rating agencies that the city's four-year plan for keeping the budget balanced is credible and that he would not simply use the money as a Band-Aid to keep spending at the current rate. Those bodies have not yet passed on the plan, though the control board's staff gave an initial favorable review.
 
Cash Surpluses
 The second chunk of money is cash surpluses that M.A.C. has accumulated from past refinancings and by setting aside extra sales tax revenues in anticipation of undertaking an earlier bond deal for the city that it has since abandoned. Until yesterday, that surplus was $200 million. Now it will amount to about $300 million over the next three years.
The M.A.C. will raise the extra $100 million by taking advantage of recent declines in interest rates by swapping old bonds carrying 7.5 percent interest from the corporation's original bond resolution of the 1970's for new short-term notes bearing interest as low as 2.6 percent.

 BODY:
In anticipation of a Federal report that will require the Government to preserve thousands of acres of ancient forests in the Pacific Northwest to save the spotted owl, Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. said today that Congress should waive the key requirement of one of the country's strictest environmental laws, the Endangered Species Act.
Mr. Lujan proposed an exception to the law that would allow the northern spotted owl to remain close to extinction in order to save jobs and permit logging in the bird's only habitat, the last great stands of Douglas fir and spruce in Washington state, Oregon, and California. 
 Mr. Lujan said he was forming a new committee of Interior Department experts to develop a plan for cutting the forests that he hoped to introduce as Federal legislation as early as April.
"I don't feel comfortable with losing 31,000 jobs," Mr. Lujan said. "What I am proposing is aimed strictly at the owl. This new team will look at a plan that neither increases nor reduces the number of owls, but keeps them at a stable population close to current levels. This is an option that we will then turn over to the Congress. They can either adopt it or deny it."
The idea of keeping owl populations near their current numbers violates the provisions of the Endangered Species Act that require the Government to take every step necessary to increase the population of endangered species until it is no longer threatened. The adoption of the idea by Congress would mean that vast stands of ancient forests will be cut down.
 
National Treasure
 Mr. Lujan's proposal was fiercely opposed today by environmental groups who say the forests are a national treasure that should be preserved not only for their beauty but also to study their botanical riches, which have included the discovery of a drug derived from the bark of the yew tree that is effective in fighting certain types of cancer.
Environmental groups have taken the case for preserving the forest to Federal court. On Wednesday, Federal District Judge Helen Frye issued a preliminary injunction blocking all logging in ancient forests on Bureau of Land Management property because of danger to the owl's habitat.
The order, which will remain in effect until the rules on the merits of the case in the spring, blocks 26 timber sales awarded by the Government since Dec. 31 and 23 sales scheduled to be offered in February and March.
"These are the last remains of a unique and irreplaceable resource," said Michael Bean, a lawyer for the Environmental Defense Fund in Washington and an expert on the Endangered Species Act. "They represent a treasure house of potentially useful resources."
The combination of an election year and a national recession has made the Bush Administration and Congress more amenable to a plan that addresses the concerns of the timber industry and its employees. In recent months, lawmakers have been besieged by residents of rural communities in the Northwest and other regions who are increasingly angry about the Endangered Species Act and other environmental laws that restrict commercial and industrial development.
Representative George Miller, the California Democrat who heads the House Interior Committee, said today that he had joined members of the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee and the House Agriculture Committee in preparing legislation that he said would save jobs and protect the forests. Mr. Miller said the legislation was not finished, and he declined to elaborate on its details.
 
Strict Guidelines
 At the core of the struggle is the 19-year-old Endangered Species Act, which sets out detailed procedures for identifying plant and animals species that appear headed for extinction and establishes strict guidelines for saving them.
Though the law's enforcement almost always leads to confrontations between industrial and environmental interests, the pitched battle over the northern spotted owl between the timber industry and environmentalists is the most intense ever produced by the Endangered Species Act.
A committee of Federal scientists has been meeting for months to develop a plan to help the owl recover by saving ancient forests in accordance with the requirements of the Endangered Species Act. The committee is expected to make its plan public in April. Mr. Lujan said today that he expected the plan to restrict cutting of the great forests.
 
Moral Questions
 Last October, Mr. Lujan took his first step to lessen the effects of the Endangered Species Act in the Northwest by convening a committee of Cabinet-level officers to consider the struggle over forests and jobs in the Northwest. The law contains a provision that allows for the formation of such a committee that can weigh economic concerns against the moral questions involved in saving an animal or plant species from extinction in difficult circumstances such as those in the Northwest. The group is expected to announce its decision in April, a month later than previously announced.
But environmental groups have raised legal questions about the authority of that committee, known in environmental circles as the God Squad, to issue directives because of the steps the Interior Department did and did not take in the case of the northern spotted owl in the years leading up to the committee's formation.
Mr. Lujan, as a result sought other measures to resolve the dispute and to protect jobs in a region that is politically important to both parties. The Washington caucus is on March 3, the Oregon primary will be held May 19, and the California primary is June 2.
In the Pacific Northwest, timber industry and forest workers enthsiastically greeted Mr. Lujan's plan to study the economic effects of saving the owl and bypassing the Endangered Species Act.
"This is the missing link that we've all been waiting for," said Evelyn Badger, the owner of a Sears Catalog Store in Canyonville, Ore., and co-director of Workers of Oregon Development, a community group that represents loggers, farmers, and business owners.
"Secretary Lujan has stepped forward in a very bold move, obviously recognizing the hardships and the devastation that have come to the people of the Northwest.
"But it will also be important to other resource dependent people across the nation," Ms. Badger said. "The spotted owl of the Northwest will be coming to their neighborhood very soon in a different form."

HEADLINE: Eugene R. Black Dies at 93; Ex-President of World Bank

 BODY:
Eugene Robert Black, a courtly Georgian who became one of the world's most influential figures as president of the World Bank from 1949 to 1962, died in his sleep early yesterday at his home in Southampton, L.I. He was 93 years old.
Mr. Black probably died of heart failure and had suffered kidney failure, said his son William H. Black. 
 Eugene Black was a relatively obscure, exceedingly competent Wall Street bond man and banker before he rose to head the bank, formally called the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
In technical retirement after 13 peripatetic years as banker to the nations outside what was then the Soviet sphere, he became a financial adviser to the United Nations and sat on the boards of many institutions and businesses -- though he gave up almost all such posts as he grew older.
At home and abroad, Mr. Black benefited from an acute mind, an engaging Southern drawl and a lack of vanity. He also brought a bluntness that disabused heads of state and finance ministers of any notion that he was an international Santa Claus.
In the banking community, his prudence, supported by a fund of matter-of-fact information, won him confidence in the soundness of his judgments.
 
Took the Large View
 On the world stage, he embodied America's postwar confidence and high hopes. Shrewd as Mr. Black might be in assessing the worth of an investment project, he took a large view of the developing world. He sought to engender an international social conscience -- a feeling that extreme differences of poverty and wealth were intolerable among nations.
He was virtually born into banking and public life, being the son and namesake of a banker who was a governor of the Federal Reserve Board, and of Gussie Grady Black, daughter of a Southern editor and orator, Henry Woodfin Grady.
The future world banker was born on May 1, 1898, in Atlanta, graduated in 1917 from the University of Georgia, served in the Navy in World War I and then joined the Atlanta office of Harris Forbes & Company, a New York bond and banking house.
Showing a knack for salesmanship, he stayed with Harris Forbes and its successors as a bond expert until 1933, when he joined the Chase National Bank in New York as a second vice president. He became a vice president in 1937.
 
Reputation Grew
 The banking community respected him for his knowledge of the bond market, and his reputation grew. It was eventually at the insistence of John J. McCloy, the president of Chase, that he joined the World Bank, which was established by the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944 chiefly to provide loans for the rebuilding of postwar Europe. It began business in 1946, and Mr. McCloy became its president in 1947. In that year, Mr. Black joined its staff as executive director for the United States.
He did so well that in 1949, when Mr. McCloy resigned as the bank's president to become High Commissioner to Germany, Mr. Black succeeded him. From then through 1962, with Mr. Black in charge, the World Bank lent more than $6 billion of its own capital, plus billions more that it borrowed in private markets, without a default.
Defining the goals broadly, Mr. Black once said the bank was "concerned primarily to insure that its loans make the greatest possible contribution to increasing production, raising living standards and opening opportunities for further investment."
 
Goal of Loans Crucial
 He believed firmly that money should be lent only for projects that would create the income, directly or indirectly, to repay the loans.
And once, speaking of the bank's role in helping third-world nations in the context of the cold war, he said, "I don't think you can combat Communism, no matter how much money you give, unless the money is properly spent."
Indeed, Mr. Black sought to harness the power of Western capitalism and private enterprise by lending almost exclusively for industrial, agricultural and power projects that would stimulate the private sector.
"Governments must cease just tolerating private business," he declared. "They must welcome its contributions."
At another time, explaining the bank's success, Mr. Black said it tried "to develop a spirit of mutual trust with its customers."
"Countries come to us for help because they know we are not involved in politics," he said. "Instead of forcing our way of life on them, we try to build a working partnership."
 
Genial but 'Hard as Nails'
 In so doing, Mr. Black spent two-thirds of his time traveling the world. His British-tailored, 6-foot-2-inch frame, topped by a tilted Homburg, appeared at one time or another in most of the bank's member nations.
He leavened business discussions with smiles and anecdotes. "But his geniality was hardboiled," an associate recalled. "He was as hard as nails when it came to appraising a project."
Mr. Black played no favorites in lending money. He was also able to deal with sometimes difficult statesmen.
On meeting President Gamal Abdel Nasser of the United Arab Republic, Mr. Black said, "I am a Wall Street banker." On this unequivocal footing, the two men became respectful friends, and in the long and tricky negotiations arising out of Mr. Nasser's seizure of the Suez Canal, Mr. Black was able to work out payments of the canal company's claims.
He was also instrumental, between 1952 and 1960, in bringing India and Pakistan to an accord over the distribution of the waters of the Indus River. The delicate negotiations were inspired in part by the bank's interests in its own projects along the waterways.
 
'He's a Charmer'
 But Mr. Black's implacable aversion to risky loans irked more than one finance minister. "I don't like your bank much," one of them told a Black aide after being turned down for a loan, "but that Black -- he's a charmer."
He was also sometimes diffident. "I'm not everything I ought to be for this job," he said after 10 years as head of the World Bank. "I had little experience in international banking. I am certainly no linguist, and I never make any speeches."
And yet Mr. Black built the World Bank from 48 member nations with a capital of $8.3 billion to 80 members with a capital of $20.5 billion. The bank also produced the International Finance Corporation and the International Development Association.
Sixty members received more than 300 loans in the Black administration. From Gabon to Guatemala, from Lebanon to Luxembourg, from Iceland to Indonesia, from France to the Philippines arose monuments to the bank's and Mr. Black's efforts in those years.
Until he resigned on Dec. 31, 1962, five months short of the mandatory retirement age of 65, his headquarters were at the bank's office in Washington, where he also made his home. In later years, he and his wife maintained homes in Brooklyn and Florida in addition to Southampton, where they eventually had their sole residence.
 
Took On Extra Jobs

Mr. Black's directorships and the like -- most of which he relinquished while in his 70's -- ranged far afield. He was a trustee of Oglethorpe College in Atlanta and the Johns Hopkins University, of the Institute for International Education and the Population Council Inc., of the National Trust for Historic Preservation and the Ford Foundation. In addition he was chairman of the John F. Kennedy Library.
On retiring from the World Bank, he was made chairman of the Brookings Institution and a board member of the Equitable Life Assurance Society, the Chase Manhattan Bank, the Bowery Savings Bank, the International Telephone and Telegraph Company, the American Express Company, Julius Garfinckel & Company, the Olin Mathieson Chemical Corporation, the Royal Dutch Petroleum Company and other companies and financial institutions. He was a member of the board of the New York Times Company from 1963 to 1973.
 
Special Adviser to U.N.
 In 1963, Mr. Black was appointed special financial consultant to the United Nations. In this role he assisted in the marketing of United Nations bonds and in dunning members in arrears. After leaving the World Bank he was also a special adviser to the ruler of Kuwait in the 1960's.
Mr. Black's first wife, the former Dolly Blalock, died in 1928.
He is survived by his second wife, the former Susette Heath, whom he married in 1930; a sister, Julia Black Wellborn of Atlanta; a daughter and a son from his first marriage, Elizabeth Black Campbell of Falmouth, Mass., and Eugene R. Black Jr. of Easthampton, L.I., who is a retired investment banker; a son from his second marriage, William H. Black of Southampton, also a retired investment banker; eight grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.
The funeral is to be private.

HEADLINE: Delinquent Parents Lose Windfall to New Jersey

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Feb. 20

 BODY:
Scores of New Jersey residents who thought they had come into a windfall from a class-action discrimination suit against the USX Corporation are in for a surprise. The state has grabbed their money for child-support payments.
State officials, who called the action precedent-setting, have intercepted $1.2 million intended for New Jerseyans who are delinquent in paying child support. 
 New Jersey has some of the toughest child-support laws in the nation, allowing officials to attach everything from the paychecks to the lottery winnings of parents who are behind in payments, and the Department of Human Services said today that pursuing settlements in class-action suits would extend the state's reach.
"In individual cases we have gone after assets, but this is the first time we've been able to go after assets on a grand scale," said Marion E. Reitz, the director of the Human Services Department's Division of Economic Assistance.
 
Award for Discrimination
 Ms. Reitz said her division intercepted the awards of 192 plaintiffs in the suit, which was filed in 1976 against USX, formerly the United States Steel Corporation. A Federal judge ruled that USX had discriminated against blacks who applied for jobs as unskilled laborers at the Fairless Hills plant, near Philadelphia, between July 1972 and December 1974 and between January 1978 and December 1979. He awarded $12 million to the plaintiffs.
USX appealed, and the case was in the courts for several years before the company agreed late last year to a $33 million settlement that included interest on the original judgment.
"When we learned that the suit against USX had been settled for more than 2,400 plaintiffs, we thought many plaintiffs could be from New Jersey and might owe child support," Ms. Reitz said. "We were right."
Ms. Reitz said her department got a list of the plaintiffs and checked their names and Social Security numbers against a computerized file of parents who are delinquent in child-support payments.
Ms. Reitz said 320 names showed up owing a total of $2.5 million. Some of the people on the list owed money to county welfare offices because their families had qualified for welfare when no child support was paid, and others owed the support directly to their families.
The state concentrated its efforts in Mercer County, which had the biggest cluster of cases and the greatest amount of money awarded.
"Our society no longer is willing to look at child support as simply an argument between two adults," said the Human Services Commissioner, Alan J. Gibbs. "It is a legitimate debt, and we owe it to the children to force delinquent parents to pay."
For the last 10 years, the Division of Economic Assistance has intercepted Federal and state tax refunds of those who owe child support. Since 1981, it has checked monthly unemployment records to determine if recipients owe back child support payments.
Gov. Jim Florio has strengthened the laws even more since coming to office two years ago. In 1990, he signed legislation that allows the state to withhold child support payments from paychecks and the state began notifying national credit agencies of parents who are delinquent.
Before ending its two-year term in January, the 204th Legislature passed a law allowing the state to attach lottery winnings to cover back child support payments.
 
Thousands of Dollars Collected
 Human services officials said they recouped $814,193 of the $1.8 million owed to Mercer County welfare, collecting from 141 of the 194 residents who owed. The largest collection was $15,813.
They also collected $349,561 from 52 other parents and turned it over to their families to cover money owed in child support. The largest amount received for a single family was $12,000, Ms. Reitz said.
Officials say that plaintiffs whose checks were attached were both men and women. The state sent a check to any person who had money left over after clearing back child support.
There are 350,000 parents in New Jersey who are under court order to pay child support, Ms. Reitz said, and about half of them are at least two weeks in arrears.
New Jersey officials learned of the USX settlement only days before the first checks were to be dispersed, when they were called by a woman who was owed child support by one of the men receiving money.
Citing a section of the Social Security Act of 1988 that allows state officials to recover delinquent child support payments anywhere in the United States, state attorneys went to court to stop the award of payments to plaintiffs who owed child support.
"The state doesn't necessarily go looking for class action lawsuits," said Deputy Attorney General Jim Hill, who coordinated the effort. "But it was such a big case that we made a judgment that something had to be done about it."
He added, "The state considers it a manifest injustice for the plaintiffs to receive this windfall when they are under court order to support their children and refuse to do so."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Memo;
Clinton Task: Making Message Heard

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WINTER HAVEN, Fla., Feb. 20

 BODY:
Standing together just out of reach of the handshake of Gov. Bill Clinton, the Dionne brothers came to the town park here today looking for answers.
None of the three young men, ages 18 to 22, have any health insurance, and two are taking courses at Polk Community College here in the hope that it will help them find other jobs. Because of their economic circumstances, all three still live at home. 
 "Getting George Bush out of office is a big issue for us, whether it's Bill Clinton or somebody else," said Pete Dionne, the eldest brother.
His brother Henry, 21 years old, said, "I'm personally not concerned about the accusations and the mudslinging," and added, "Since George Bush has been President, my father has lost his job and I've lost my job."
None of the brothers had ever heard of Paul E. Tsongas until the former Massachusetts Senator won the New Hampshire Democratic Presidential primary two days ago. They were more familiar with Mr. Clinton because he is from the South. But their presence at the Clinton rally was due more to curiosity than commitment.
It is these voters -- young, male, alienated -- that Mr. Clinton must win if he is to regain his footing and win the Democratic nomination. To do so, his advisers realize, he must learn from the mistakes that nearly derailed his campaign in New Hampshire and capitalize on his convincing second place finish in New Hampshire.
 
'The Comeback Kid'
 It was an artful and successful bit of political spin that allowed Mr. Clinton to annoint himself "the comeback kid" at his election night rally on Tuesday. His advisers had started inserting the word "comeback" into all their conversations in the hours before the polls closed, and by the next day, astute campaign organizers in Georgia and Florida had lifted the phrase from the morning's headlines and plastered it on cardboard placards for rallies.
For the first time in weeks, the Clinton campaign had finally won the expectations game. And with the spotlight shifting away from Mr. Clinton and onto the Bush-Buchanan contest, Mr. Clinton also had a chance to catch his breath.
The Arkansas Governor acknowledged as much today, commenting on a plane ride between campaign stops that he had been in a "coma" for the past two days, hoarse from his nagging New England head cold and ready for a slower campaign pace.
But Mr. Clinton denied published reports today that he was scaling back his efforts in Maryland, which holds its primary on the same day as Georgia, March 3. Nonetheless, he told reporters he considered Maryland a Tsongas state.
"I would expect that a lot of people there would agree with some of the things he has said, because they are more upper middle class than middle class," he said.
Mr. Clinton's theory ignores the fact that Maryland is a state more Southern in nature than Mr. Clinton may realize and that its two largest metropolitan areas -- Baltimore and Prince George's County near Washington -- have majority black populations that supported Jesse Jackson in 1984 and 1988.
Mr. Clinton has scored well among former Jackson supporters in polls in other states, and all his Southern campaign stops are well-attended by black elected officials and other community leaders.
His challenge in the South, he said today, is to attempt to make sure that his messages are heard.
 
On the Death Penalty
 "I don't think what I did caused me a rocky time in New Hampshire," Mr. Clinton told reporters today in Albany, Ga. "I think I'm going to go back to the issues. I'm going to run the campaign I started with. And I think the campaign I started with will do real well down here."
Mr. Clinton also sought to play down comments made by Gov. Zell Miller of Georgia that Mr. Tsongas would not be considered electable by Southern voters because he opposed the death penalty. Mr. Tsongas has said he favored the death penalty only in certain cases, like for drug kingpins.
Mr. Clinton, who supports the death penalty and returned to Arkansas to preside over the execution of a convicted murderer on Jan. 24, said he considered Mr. Tsongas's position an attempt to "fudge" on the issue.
But he also said that he does not plan to emphasize their disagreement on the capital punishment issue to win votes in the South, where many people favor the death penalty.
"I've never tried to use the death penalty as a political issue," he said. "It's just that we have a law that we agree with and I follow it. That's my position on it."
He said New Hampshire voters became convinced that Mr. Tsongas was the candidate with the best new ideas because "my ideas were blown out of their consciousness for three solid weeks."
He added, "And in the last eight days when we finally got the campaign going again, what got people excited was the idea that I was a fighter, that I could plainly be President, that I could plainly stand up to George Bush and fight and argue."
Mr. Clinton salvaged his New Hampshire campaign by engaging in what one of his advisers later described as a "high-wire act" in which he was forced to perform credibly on live televison five times within a single week, including three nationally broadcast programs.
 
Looking to TV
 The Clinton campaign is now counting on turning its candidate's strength on television to quick advantage prior to the string of primaries that begin next week in South Dakota and culminate with the Super Tuesday grouping of 11 primaries and caucuses on March 10.
Gone are the rambling question-and-answer sessions Mr. Clinton held with New Hampshire voters after each speech and the late-night visits to doughnut shops and half-empty restaurants in search of hands to shake. Instead, Mr. Clinton has spent the last two days engaging in classic Super Tuesday strategy, hopping from fund-raising events to television markets and back again.
And now that the grueling pace of the New Hampshire primary is behind them, Clinton campaign strategists are beginning to hope for a little positive fallout from the events that just days ago had seemed only negative.
"Bill and Hillary are celebrities now," one of Mr. Clinton's advisers said last week. "I don't know if it's a positive or negative. I just know it's a fact. But something in my gut tells me it's a positive, because Americans forgive celebrities."

HEADLINE: RESEARCH SPENDING IS DECLINING IN U.S. AS IT RISES ABROAD

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
American spending on research and development has begun to fall for the first time since the 1970's, even as foreign rivals increase their investments in research, a Federal science agency said yesterday.
The amounts spent on research by the Federal Government and private industry each fell, worrying many analysts. They fear that the nation is losing its edge in the international race for discoveries and innovations that can form the basis for new goods and services. 
 The National Science Board, in its biennial report on the health of the nation's research enterprise, said overall spending on research by the Federal Government, industry, universities and private patrons slowed during the second half of the 1980's and began to fall in 1989, ending an era of extraordinary growth.
 
Recession and End of Cold War
 A Federal analyst, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the decline was caused by cutbacks in military research with the end of the cold war and by industrial reductions prompted in part by the recession.
Dr. James J. Duderstadt, president of the University of Michigan and chairman of the National Science Board, said in a statement that the decline, when coupled with educational woes, "should give us real concern for the continued vitality of our research enterprise."
He noted that the United States, despite the drop, still leads the world in overall spending on scientific research.
Yet analysts already edgy about America's status in the global contest for economic advantage expressed worry about the research decline. American spending is falling, they said, as similar investments by Japan and Germany are rising rapidly.
"Clearly it's another warning sign," said Kent H. Hughes, president of the Council on Competitiveness, a private group in Washington that seeks policies to promote industrial vigor. "Especially on the private side, I'd be concerned. That's the research closest to commercialization and marketable products."
Dr. Frank Press, president of the National Academy of Sciences, a federally chartered organization of scientists that advises the Government, agreed. "We especially need to ask why industrial research is down when for other countries it's going up," he said. "That's a matter of concern."
News of the overall drop came in a 487-page report, "Science and Engineering Indicators." Its author, the National Science Board, is the policy-making arm of the National Science Foundation, a Federal agency that supports science research and is responsible for monitoring the nation's overall scientific health.
The biennial report is meant to give decision makers in Government, industry and academia concise information about national trends in science spending, education, manpower and the various fruits of the research enterprise, including patents, scientific papers and new technologies.
In recent decades, the only other drop in overall science spending occurred in the early 1970's as the United States reduced space research after the Apollo moon landings and cut back on military research amid an early thaw in the cold war.
 
Peak at $154.31 Billion
 The new report shows that the United States, beginning in 1975, embarked on a spending spree that climaxed in 1989 with an annual national expenditure for research and development of $154.31 billion. After that peak, the amount for 1990 fell to $151.57 billion. The figures are in constant 1991 dollars to cancel the effects of inflation.
The report said that preliminary data suggest that the total for 1991 will be about the same as 1990. But a Federal analyst working on the data suggested that the 1991 total might go down further.
"The dip," said the Federal analyst, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, "is not simply in Federal dollars but in almost all sectors.
"The bottom line for industry is that they had tremendous growth in the first half of the 80's," the analyst said. "And now, with a change of expectations in profits and sales, and a certain amount of consolidation, there's been a slowing in research and development."
From a peak in 1989 of $78.83 billion, annual research spending by American industry dropped to $77.84 billion in 1990, according to the report. It was the biggest drop in three decades.
 
'Probably Will Get Worse'
 "It's bad news," said Erich Bloch, former director of the National Science Foundation. "And it probably will get worse. A couple of years ago, the leveling off had to do with restructuring. But the drop now has to do with the recession and restructuring."
Even before the decline, the rate of growth had fallen sharply. Between 1980 and 1985 the rate of annual growth for industrial research was 6.9 percent in inflation-adjusted dollars, the report said. Between 1985 and 1990, it fell to 1.2 percent.
The report also noted that the American share of the global market for high-technology goods had fallen from 40 percent in 1980 to 37 percent in 1988.
The report, which is required by Congressional legislation, is submitted by the National Science Board to the President, who in turn provides it to Congress. The current volume is the 10th in a biennial series begun in 1972.
In a preface to the report, Dr. Duderstadt of the National Science Board noted the rapid changes around the globe and warned that American research priorities and programs must be "refined and reshaped to adapt."

HEADLINE: Corporate Tax Cut Deleted As Democrats Polish Bill

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 20

 BODY:
Congressional Democrats moved today to increase the chances for passage of their tax proposals. House leaders dropped an unpopular corporate tax provision and a powerful Senator said he would try to include a politically attractive health insurance measure in the bill.
House Democrats, after a second day of party caucuses dominated by continual criticism of a proposed one-percentage-point cut in the corporate income tax rate, decided to eliminate the provision from the bill entirely. On Wednesday, they had decided to limit the cut to two years rather than make it permanent, as first planned. 
 Those shifts were aimed at winning Democratic votes for the six-year tax bill, whose centerpiece is a tax credit of up to $400 for married couples, financed mainly by raising the highest personal income tax bracket to 35 percent, from 31. The corporate tax cut provision had attracted no visible support, even from corporations.
The bill now has $79.1 billion in tax cuts and $93.5 billion in tax increases.
Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said in an interview that he would seek to attach a measure intended to improve access to private health insurance to the tax bill. The measure would set Federal standards for insurance companies and prohibit them from discriminating against people with existing medical problems, who now have difficulty obtaining insurance at affordable rates. It would also make it easier for small businesses to obtain group policies.
Mr. Bentsen said his proposal, which has wide support in Congress and has been generally endorsed by President Bush, should be part of the tax bill, both to get action on the insurance measure quickly and to make the overall package more attractive politically.
He said including the health insurance measure would make it harder for Mr. Bush to veto the bill, as Republicans have threatened because of the provisions raising taxes.
"It sure makes it a positive package," he said, adding that he did not think that overall health care reform could be enacted this year, but that this was an important "interim step."
Mr. Bentsen also announced, after a caucus among Senate Democrats, that any tax-cut bill his committee reported would be financed by tax increases. Last fall he had proposed paying for tax cuts with a cut in military spending. The shift in approach puts him on the same track as House Democrats.
 He said he thought that along with "better access to health care," any Senate bill should include a tax cut for the middle class, probably focused on children, and a cut in capital gains taxes "targeted to try to encourage new business and small business and venture capital."
Mr. Bentsen said he did not want to get into numbers today, but would make a proposed bill public on Monday. He does not dominate his committee the way Representative Dan Rostenkowski, Democrat of Illinois, dominates the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, if not his party, in the House. The Finance Committee consists of 10 Democrats, some of them quite conservative, and 9 Republicans, some of them fairly liberal.
The committee will begin voting on the measure on Thursday, and Mr. Bentsen may find he has broader support for his insurance proposal, which has considerable Republican backing, than for the underlying tax measure.
 
 
Military Savings at Issue
 The acknowledgement that any tax cuts would be paid for with tax increases also ended a disagreement with Senator Robert C. Byrd, the West Virginia Democrat and chairman of the Appropriations Committee, who has insisted that any savings from military programs go to domestic needs.
In fact, under the 1990 budget act, military savings this year can be used only to reduce the deficit. But the House Government Operations Committee voted today to amend that act so that the savings could be used for domestic programs. Before the vote, Representative John Conyers Jr., the Michigan Democrat who heads that committee, called the restriction "an outdated and unnecessary budgetary straitjacket."
The Bush Administration is generally opposed to eliminating the so-called internal firewalls in the budget act. The proposed change is expected to come to the House for a vote in late March or early April.
 
 
Foley Predicts Passage
 The tax bill is expected to come up next Wednesday or Thursday. "The bill will pass," Speaker Thomas S. Foley said after today's caucus.
He said the House would also vote on Mr. Bush's proposals. "It's my view that in that comparison, this does more for tax equity and fairness, this does more for economic growth, and it's more fiscally responsible," he said.
Asked if Mr. Bush's promised veto did not reduce the Democratic bill to no more than a "political document," Mr. Foley replied: "No. Is not the President's threat just a political threat? We have to make our judgments, and the President has to make his." He said that if Congress gave way every time a President threatened a veto, that would "create a dictatorship."
Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who is his party's senior member on the Ways and Means Committee, complained today that the Democrats were being unfair in not permitting him to make changes in the President's proposal that will be offered on the floor. Since the Democrats were changing their bill from day to day, he said in an interview, he should have the same chance. "I've got 100 changes I'd like to make," he said.

HEADLINE: Dow Surges by 50.32, to a Record 3,280.64

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Surprising investors and traders alike, the stock market rallied sharply yesterday amid a barrage of program trades and speculation that weak numbers on jobless claims and merchandise trade will put pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates again.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 50.32 points to a new closing record of 3,280.64, surpassing the Feb. 12 mark of 3,276.83. 
 Heavy buying in secondary and transportation stocks, led by autos, helped spur stock purchases across the board.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange reached 270.7 million shares, up from 234.8 million on Wednesday, as the composite index gained 2.85 points to finish at 228.60. The number of issues trading higher jumped ahead of the losers by 1,158 to 593.
Other market averages recorded strong gains but not records. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 5.64 points, to 413.90, and the American Stock Exchange composite rose 5.40 points, to 412.86. Trading on the Nasdaq was also heavy: The composite rose 9.82 points, to 632.23, while the Russell 2,000 rose 2.53 points, to 210.89.
John Brooks, a technical analyst with Davis, Mendel & Regenstein, Atlanta, said yesterday's solid performance was not generated by program trading alone. "This was legitimate buying, with no one particular piece of news to pinpoint for the 50-point rally, which makes the whole day that much more solid-looking," he said. "What you are witnessing is a continuation of money coming from the money market, where yields are still low, and flowing into the stock market. Yesterday the money just overpowered the bears."
Birinyi Associates, a Wall Street research firm that tracks program trading, noted only two sell programs, in the morning. They raised the Dow 24.6 points, a little less than half of its gain.
A firmer bond market early in the session helped touch off the rally. Blue- chip issues opened modestly higher as investors speculated that a rise of 18,000 in weekly jobless claims, 6,000 more than expected, would put pressure on the Fed to ease interest rates again.
The merchandise trade numbers, also released yesterday, showed a widening of the gap to $5.94 billion in December from $4.17 billion in November.
The Dow shied away from putting into effect the Big Board's 50-point rule a number of times before reaching that point at around 2:15 P.M. Once the Dow is up 50 points, program traders are forced to do their transactions manually instead of by computer, slowing down the pace and assuring a more orderly session.
Short-sellers, who sell borrowed stock in the hope of buying it back at a lower price, are being routed as more investors bet on companies that would benefit from a recovery, Mr. Brooks said. "There has been a lot of shorting by investors in the last week or so, betting that the stocks were headed down, and yesterday some of those investors had to buy stocks in order to cover themselves," he said. He cited General Motors shares, which were around 27 before Christmas but closed up 5/8 yesterday to 39.
Gene J. Seagle, director of technical research for Gruntal & Company, stressed the importance of the recovery in transportation stocks. "Up until yesterday many of the technical people in the market were worried that the transportation sector had not yet confirmed the recent highs on the Dow," he said. "Getting both the Dow and the transportation indexes to move up in step confirmed the market's outlook for an economic recovery."
The Dow transportation index set a new 52-week closing high of 1,467.68, up 42.79 points for the day.
Some analysts noticed some futures-related trading as the market approached today's expiration of equity options and February major market index futures, a "double witching hour" that takes place the third Friday of every month.
The day's outstanding gainers including Ivax Corporation, up 2 3/8, to 35 7/8, on news that its Alzheimer's disease treatment will begin second round of studies.
Traders said shares of companies that make breast implants rose after a regulatory panel said there was no solid evidence linking the implants to autoimmune disease.
Dow Chemical rose 1 1/2, to 57 1/2, and Corning Inc. gained 3 3/8, to 33. Both companies own half of Dow Corning, the leading implant maker. Mentor Corporation gained 1 3/4, to 11; Bioplasty rose 1 1/4, to 6 1/4, and the Inamed Corporation rose 1/2, to 2.
Marvel Entertainment fell 2 1/8, to 52 7/8, after a rival comic book company, Malibu Graphic Publishing Group, said it had hired eight former Marvel comic artists and creators. Marvel dropped earlier this week after Barron's magazine questioned the company's prospects.

In Quest of a Brighter Labor Climate

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BAL HARBOUR, Fla., Feb. 20

 BODY:
Even when Presidents are Republicans, trade unions usually find grounds for getting along with secretaries of labor on some issues, even if agreeing to disagree on others. But union leaders meeting here this week to plan policies find the current incumbent, Lynn Martin, as hostile as they come.
Like previous labor secretaries, Mrs. Martin, who has been in office a year, appeared at a closed session of the 35-member executive council of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations. Participants at the annual gathering said she noted at least twice that a mere 16.1 percent of American workers belonged to unions. Unions attribute the decline in part to Republican policies that discourage people from joining unions, and they interpreted her remarks as a way of saying that unions do not matter. 
Asked later about Mrs. Martin's appearance, Lane Kirkland, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said, "The areas of disagreement and disparity of views that surfaced were nicely coated with expressions of concern." He mocked her "blithe optimism" that the trade agreement with Mexico would not result in the loss of American jobs.
Ready, Willing and Sidelined
Ronald Carey, elected president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters on a promise to purge the union of corruption, showed up at the door to the conference's first executive council meeting on Monday seemingly raring to go to work.
As head of the richest and biggest union, with 1.4 million members, Mr. Carey can be expected to wield some influence at these weeklong conferences, where leaders of the nation's major unions work out positions on legislative and other issues. But Mr. Carey discovered that he would have to wait for another day to get in.
As Mr. Carey approached the conference room, William J. McCarthy, who retired as teamsters president with Mr. Carey's inauguration on Feb. 1, invited Mr. Carey into an anteroom for a chat. Twenty minutes later, it was the retired president who emerged to take a seat at the conference. Without comment or evident emotion, the new teamsters leader headed back to his room.
The seat on the executive council, it turns out, was still Mr. McCarthy's because he was elected to it for another two-year term by delegates to an A.F.L.-C.I.O. convention in November. Normally, a member who loses his union job immediately relinquishes his council seat to his successor, although nothing says he must. Mr. McCarthy intended to give up his seat but in his own way.
"Billy indicated he wanted to spend the day listening to the presentations," Mr. Carey said of their chat. Inside, near the end of the meeting, John Sturdivant, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, said Mr. McCarthy made a gracious and brief speech.
"He said his health was bothering him, that he was having problems with his voice and hearing," Mr. Sturdivant said. "He submitted his resignation and proposed Carey," whom the council promptly elected.
Blaming the Unions
Unions tend to attribute their troubles to everyone but themselves. But on the fringes of the gathering here, some of the several hundred guests are blaming the unions for not getting their message to the public, and in particular they blame Mr. Kirkland's A.F.L.-C.I.O.
Greg Tarpinian, head of a labor advocacy group in New York, the Labor Research Association, distributed the results of a survey by Fingerhut/Granados Opinion Research showing that only 3 percent of American voters even knew who Mr. Kirkland is.
"Nineteen ninety-two should be a watershed year for American labor," Mr. Tarpinian said, adding that a weak economy could be used to drive the Republicans out of the White House. "But labor needs an overarching strategic outlook, and it doesn't have one," he said.
A state labor leader who refused to be named for fear of losing his job added: "There is nobody giving a vision of the labor movement to the American public. If you asked who is the spokesman for workers, it's Jesse Jackson, and he's not a part of the labor movement."
Search for a Rescuer
For an institution that fears it is sinking toward irrelevance as long as Republicans remain in the White House, organized labor seems apathetic about the men who are vying to dislodge President Bush. At meetings here two years ago, half the participants seemed to be wearing lapel buttons assailing Frank Lorenzo, head of the now defunct Eastern Airlines, for union-busting.
But of several hundred people attending a reception here this week, only one guest had a Presidential campaign button. David Schlein, a vice president of the American Federation of Government Employees, wore one reading, "Labor for Tom Harkin." One other man, Gerald McEntee, a council member who is president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees wore a Clinton sticker, but in deference to the council's agreement to stay neutral until later in the week, when a decision is made on whom to support, he kept it on the back of his lapel.
Political figures who arouse strong support here, like Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, are not running, though hopes were high for a while that they would.
Rumors circulated at the start of the conference that the many New Yorkers who run unions were plotting to ally behind Mr. Cuomo.
"I think there's a real opportunity to throw Bush out," said Moe Biller, president of the American Federation of Postal Workers, a New Yorker who at 76 years old is the dean of the council. "I think Cuomo can do the number best."
But then came the write-in vote in New Hampshire that left Mr. Cuomo in the rear of the pack.
Upon agreeing to end their neutrality in the campaign, 14 unions said they would be supporting Senator Harkin, three said they would back Mr. Clinton, and the rest said they were still sounding out their members.
"We don't have anybody out there that people like," said Barry Feinstein, the top teamsters' leader in New York. "So people are settling."

Prices of Treasuries Unchanged

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were little changed in extremely sluggish trading yesterday.
With auctions of new two-year and five-year notes next week, and many traders seeing the prospect of another reduction in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve Board dimming, there was some light selling of shorter-term bills and notes, and purchases of longer-term notes and bonds. But trading volume was very light. 
 "If I had a pillow I'd be asleep," a government-securities trader said.
Traders are taking recent comments by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, at face value. As recently as Wednesday, the Fed chief indicated that for the time being the Fed had finished easing monetary policy, although not ruling out further interest-rate cuts if the economy continues to stall.
For the most part, market participants ignored economic data released yesterday, including a wider trade deficit reported for December but a much smaller gap for all of 1991.
The 18,000 rise in initial unemployment claims for the week ended Feb. 8, to 452,000, was a bit higher than expected, but was met with little reaction.
 
Money Supply Rises
 Similarly, prices did not move much late in the day after the Fed reported that all three measures of the nation's money supply rose during the week ended Feb. 10.
The increase in the aggregates, particularly the $9.5 billion rise in M-2, the money measure most closely followed by the Fed, was bigger than most analysts had expected.
"We refer to these numbers as the money surprise, not the money supply," said Steven A. Wood, director of financial markets research at the Bank of America. "But it is clear that the money numbers have been growing at a much better pace since October. If you are an optimist about the economy, this has to be an encouraging sign."
Prices of outstanding Treasury notes and bonds remained locked in narrow trading ranges for most of the session.
By late in the day, the 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 1012/32 , up 1/32 , to yield 7.90 percent, unchanged from late Wednesday.
 
Treasury Note Action
 Among Treasury note issues, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 10025/32 , up 1/32 , to yield 7.38 percent. The 6 1/4 percent five-year notes were offered at 9810/32 , down 1/8 point, to yield 6.65 percent. And the 4 7/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 99 1/4, down 1/8 point, to yield 5.28 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates moved higher.
By late in the session, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 3.87 percent, up four basis points, or four one-hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates rose by a similar amount, to a late offered rate of 3.99 percent. And one-year bill rates rose by seven basis points, to a late offered rate of 4.17 percent.
A number of market participants said the chances of a rally would improve once next week's note auctions were over.
"The big problem right now is that there is still a lot of paper out there from the refunding," another Government securities trader said.
"But once we get through with the two-year and five-year auctions, it will be a month before we have to bid on more coupon issues. That will give dealers a chance to pare their positions, and we should get a bounce. I think we are setting up for a decent rally in March, provided the economic statistics don't blow us out of the water."
In the investment-grade corporate bond market, Public Service Electric and Gas offered $250 million worth of 30-year and 7-year first and refunding mortgage bonds at competitive bid.
A bid from a group led by the First Boston Corporation won the $150 million worth of 30-year noncallable securities, which mature Feb. 1, 2022.
The securities were reoffered to investors with a coupon of 8 3/4 percent at a price of $99.75, to yield 8.773, 87 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 at the time of pricing.
 
Salomon Bid Wins
 The remaining $100 million of seven-year notes were won by a bid from a group led by Salomon Brothers.
The securities, which mature Feb. 1, 2000, were reoffered with a 7 5/8 percent coupon and were priced at $100, or par, 60 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 6 3/8 percent seven-year notes at the time of pricing.
The securities are rated A-2 by Moody's Investors Service and A by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
In the tax-exempt municipal bond market, Harris County, Tex., offered a total of $448 million worth of bonds in a negotiated sale through underwriters led by Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company.
The bulk of the issue consisted of term bonds maturing in 2017. These 6.50 percent securities were priced on a preliminary basis to yield 6.79 percent.
These bonds are insured by the Ambac Indemnity Corporation, and are rated AAA by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's.
The remainder of the bonds are not insured, and are rated AA by Moody's and AA+ by Standard & Poor's.
Traders in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds said that prices of most issues were unchanged at the end of a very slow session.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal securities, participants said that prices of most widely quoted issues rose by about 1/8 point.

HEADLINE: At the Bar

BYLINE: By David Margolick

 BODY:
Even in a recessionary economy, jury awards in personal injury cases continue to climb. According to the biweekly newsletter for trial lawyers, Lawyers Alert, last year's 10 top awards to plaintiffs amounted to "an eye-popping" $673 million.
The biggest award of them all -- $127 million -- went to an Illinois man whose ophthalmologist missed in administering a crucial injection. But to the Federation of Insurance and Corporate Counsel, the point is clear: something must be done to tame runaway, bleeding-heart juries, so profligate with their clients' money. 
 Enter J. Ric Gass of Kravit, Gass & Weber in Milwaukee, chairman of the federation's trial-tactics section. Mr. Gass is the auteur of "Handling Sympathy in Jury Trials," an hourlong videotape on how to counteract the compassion that human beings feel for brain-damaged infants, mutilated youngsters, amputees and quadriplegics.
Sympathy, Mr. Gass maintains, is "the major scare tactic" of the plaintiffs' bar. Faced with weak liability claims, he says, they pollute courtrooms with anguished "day-in-the-life" videos, dismal diagrams and photographs that would make a Goya wince. So Mr. Gass assembled for the video some colleagues in the defense bar to offer secrets for turning "boxcar" awards into snake-eyes.
Just how, for instance, did Jack Daniels of Los Angeles extricate his film director client from liability for an accident on the set of "Cannonball Run" that left a "gorgeous" young actress paralyzed from the neck down? By his own account, he made several strategically savvy decisions.
For one thing, he did not object to the victim's continuous presence in the courtroom. "I want to desensitize that jury," he said, so they get used to seeing the plaintiff in that catastrophic condition. "Otherwise, if you don't have the plaintiff there, the first time they wheel them in the courtroom, you'll hear a gasp."
Rather than grill the victim and make her even more pitiable, he continued, he elicited whatever damaging testimony he needed -- for example her failure to use a seat belt -- from others. And always, he treated her with conspicuous courtesy: holding open doors for her so she could wheel herself around, greeting her cheerfully each morning. "I didn't want anything to have those jurors feel that I didn't think she was a wonderful person," he explained. "That's my M.O. at the trial."
Plaintiffs, Mr. Gass noted, produce plenty of people to say how miserable their lives have become -- "moaners and groaners," he calls them. But another panelist, Michael Jones of Denver, urged defense counsel to accent the positive, to point out all those things, say, that paraplegics can do. One could get helpful hints, Mr. Jones said, from the National Wheelchair Athletic Association and its magazine, Sports and Spokes.
"They talk about scuba diving, sailing, bowling, archery, shooting -- all those activities that show that, yes, these people have a very severe, very debilitating injury," he said, "but there are aspects of everyday life that they can do, perhaps with some modifications." Never, never let yourself or your client look too downcast -- or in the other direction -- when things get too gory. "A jury's going to pick that up," he said.
At the same time, one cannot sidestep the negative. "John, you've developed a technique for dealing with the gruesome photographs that we all have to deal with it," Mr. Gass said cheerfully on camera to John Woodard 3d, a lawyer in Tulsa, Okla. Mr. Woodard then recounted how, in a successful medical malpractice defense, he pre-emptively showed four photographs of a mutilated body to prospective jurors rather than spring them on the panel at trial.
One must produce another kind of sympathy -- for the defense counsel, the video advises. Emphasize that simply because you work for an insurance company does not mean that you are a monster. Let a jury know that you, too, would cry if one of your own children had been similarly injured. And make it clear, as Mr. Gass put it, that "there's no line outside the courtroom of attorneys angling for my job."
Mr. Gass said that sales of the video were brisk and that the testimonials were rolling in. Richard Johnson of Everett, Wash., wrote to say that he views it before every trial. Robert Wilson of Los Angeles said it should be required viewing for all defense lawyers.
Thus far, the opposition has been silent, and understandably. "We don't sell it to plaintiffs' lawyers," Mr. Gass explained.

HEADLINE: Joseph Fisher, 78, Economic Adviser to Presidents

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
Joseph L. Fisher, an expert on natural resources and an economist who advised two Presidents, served in Congress and was a local and state official in Virginia, died on Wednesday at his home in Arlington, Va. He was 78 years old.
He died of a brain tumor, his family said. 
 Dr. Fisher was a senior economist for the Council of Economic Advisers to the President for four years under Harry S. Truman and one year under Dwight D. Eisenhower.
For the next 20 years Dr. Fisher worked for Resources for the Future, a nonprofit organization that analyzes the supply and use of natural resources. He was its president for 15 years and in 1962 directed a 1,000-page forecast of the nation's needs through the year 2000. He later served on Federal panels on oil policy and noise pollution.
A Democrat, he was elected to the Arlington County Board in 1964, serving until 1974. He was its chairman for three years. He also led the Washington Metropolitan Transit Authority and the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments.
In the 1974 Democratic landslide that followed the Watergate revelations, he upset Joel T. Broyhill, a 20-year incumbent, to win a seat in Congress. Despite being a freshman, Dr. Fisher was given a coveted seat on the House Ways and Means Committee, and he became an influential legislator on the budget, taxes and Social Security. He also helped create a fund to clean up oil spills. He lost his seat in the Republican sweep of 1980.
In 1982, Gov. Charles S. Robb of Virginia appointed Dr. Fisher as State Secretary of Human Resources. He left government work in 1986 and began teaching political economics at George Mason University.
A longtime lay leader in the Unitarian Church, he was for several years the moderator and chairman of the international Unitarian Universalist Association. He was also a former board chairman of the National Academy of Public Administration and the Population Reference Bureau and was on the board of the Wilderness Society.
Mr. Fisher was born in Pawtucket, R.I. He earned a bachelor's degree from Bowdoin College, a master's and a doctorate in economics from Harvard and a master's in education from George Washington University.
Surviving are his wife, the former Margaret Winslow; four sons, H. Benjamin of Jakarta, Indonesia, Robert W., of Fort Worth, Tex., William B., of Great Falls, Va., and James H., of Yellow Springs, Ohio; three daughters, Caroline Ostrander of Ithaca, N.Y., Elizabeth Fisher of Hong Kong and Barbara W. Fisher of Arlington; 14 grandchildren, and a sister, Mary McWilliams of Canton, Mass.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
A Seasoned Executive Is Heading Air Canada

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
Air Canada yesterday named Hollis L. Harris, a former top executive at both Delta and Continental, as vice chairman, president and chief executive.
The 60-year-old Mr. Harris, who was not available for comment, will face several challenges in managing Air Canada, the former state-owned airline that is now a publicly traded corporation. 
 Air Canada, based in Montreal, and its largest competitor, Canadian Airlines International, a subsidiary of the PWA Corporation, are battling for passengers amid a deep slump in travel. Yesterday, Air Canada reported a 1991 loss of $218 million (Canadian), or $184 million (United States), on revenue of $3.57 billion (Canadian), or $3 billion (United States).
Canadian Government and industry officials are considering several options to help the nation's troubled airlines. One would be to merge Air Canada and Canadian Airlines, which would probably make 10,000 jobs unnecessary. With Canada's unemployment rate above 10 percent, such a move is considered politically risky.
"That is not politically tenable or financially feasible," said Steven Garmaise, an analyst with First Marathon Securities in Toronto.
Canadian officials may also loosen foreign-ownership requirements. PWA is reportedly discussing ties with American Airlines. But relying on help from American carriers would also be politically unpopular among Canadians, who fear growing American influence. Although American partners would hold a minority interest, their level of control would likely be that of a majority owner, analysts said.
He left Delta to join Continental Airlines as chairman, president and chief executive in September 1990.
At Continental, which is operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection, Mr. Harris adopted a strategy of expansion, even as the industry was in the midst of a recession and fare wars. Eventually, the airline's creditors and its board forced his departure. Last year, he joined Air Eagle Holdings, an Atlanta-based aviation consulting service.
Mr. Harris holds an aeronautical engineering degree from the Georgia Institute of Technology.

HEADLINE: December Trade Gap Widened

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 20

 BODY:
Dwindling exports resulted in a sharp widening of the nation's merchandise trade deficit in December, but for 1991 as a whole, the deficit narrowed to $66.20 billion, the smallest shortfall in eight years.
The Bush Administration hailed the full-year results as a sign of renewed American competitiveness, and members of Congress from both parties said that the improvement last year would be more important in the national debate over protectionism than December's poor showing. 
 In December, the deficit grew by 42 percent, to $5.94 billion, as exports fell and imports climbed, the Commerce Department said.
 
Exports Up in '91
 But for the full year, exports rose 7.2 percent, led by a 9.3 percent gain for manufactured goods, the main casualties from foreign competition during the 1980's. And imports fell for the first time since 1982.
"Those figures would tend to dampen down the enthusiasm for trade law changes," said Representative Don J. Pease, an Ohio Democrat who supports more trade restrictions. "If I were President Bush and could say that I'd reduced the trade deficit from over $100 billion to $66 billion, I'd be pretty pleased."
Economists, however, attribute much of the improvement from the $101.7 billion deficit in 1990 and the peak $152.1 billion deficit in 1987 to the weakening of the American economy, which has left businesses and individuals less able to afford imports.
 
Recession Is Cited
 "At least half, maybe two-thirds, of the year's improvement was due to the recession," said C. Fred Bergsten, the director of the Institute for International Economics, a Washington public policy research group.
And the widening trade gap reported for December served as unwelcome news for Mr. Bush's re-election campaign. as the seasonally adjusted deficit deteriorated by $1.77 billion from November.
J. Antonio Villamil, the Commerce Department's chief economist, said the increase in the deficit in December was not significant because a third of it reflected a decline in aircraft exports, which vary enormously from month to month as planes worth $100 million or more apiece are delivered in bunches.
But private economists generally agree that as other industrialized nations' economies continue to slow down this year, making them less able to buy American exports, trade balances in 1992 will more likely resemble the December results than the overall improvement in 1991.
The United States will avoid deterioration in its trade balance this year, Mr. Bergsten said, only if the economic recovery is exceptionally weak.
 
Exports Down in December
 Exports, which accounted for most of the nation's economic growth in 1990 and 1991 and which the Administration sees as powering the nation's economic recovery, dropped 2.2 percent in December. And the Commerce Department also revised today its November export figure to show a drop instead of a record high.
Japan and China, two of the nation's three least politically popular trade partners, showed bigger trade surpluses with the United States in 1991. The third trading partner, Mexico, with which the Administration is negotiating a free-trade agreement, last year posted its first deficit with the United States in a decade.
Exports to Japan dropped sharply in December and slightly for all of last year, so that the annual trade deficit between the nations widened to $43.44 billion from $41.10 billion, the first such deterioration since 1987.
The persistent deficit with Japan has grown to two-thirds of the overall deficit from a third in the last four years, and Congressional Democrats have made it a centerpiece of their recent criticisms of Administration trade policy.
"I think it's frustrating to see us make this kind of progress with the Europeans, with Mexico and many other countries" but not Japan, said Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who heads the Finance Committee.
The trade deficit with China expanded to $12.7 billion last year from $10.4 billion. After nearly a year of political maneuvering, the Senate is expected to vote within the next week and finally send President Bush a bill imposing conditions on the June renewal of China's trade access to the American market. The President has promised to veto the bill.
Today's report contributed little to resolving the fundamental trade-deficit question that has divided international trade experts and economists: whether the improvement of the last four years represents a structural and lasting change in America's role in world markets or simply the steep slide since 1985 in the dollar's value, which has made imports more expensive and American exports more competitive abroad.
Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., the president of the Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington public policy group, said the rising deficit with Japan shows that foreign trade barriers persist while America's domestic weaknesses, such as high health-care costs, continue to hobble American exporters. "Devaluation of the dollar devalues U.S. assets and makes us all poorer," he said.
A study released today by Kenneth Leventhal & Company, a large accounting firm, said that Japanese investors had used the strong yen to buy $76 billion worth of American real estate since the mid-1980's, although the pace slowed significantly last year.
 
A Lasting Difference
 But Harold Malmgren, a deputy United States trade representative during the Nixon and Ford Administrations, said that slow growth in American industrial wages and the trimming of corporate middle management had made a lasting difference in keeping American goods affordable in foreign markets. The main threat to American exports this year lies in the possibility that the weakness of foreign economies will cause a rise in the dollar's value, he said.
The trade deficit announced today may be worse than it seems because it includes only goods and because exports are often undercounted, several economists said. The nation ran an estimated $34 billion trade surplus in services last year, largely because of a big increase in foreign tourism.
A report last month from the National Research Council estimated that American exports of goods were undercounted by 3 to 7 percent, or $13 billion to $29 billion last year, because duties were not charged on them.
Including the undercounting and services, the nation's trade in goods and services was nearly balanced last year.

A School's 'Organizer Extraordinaire'

BYLINE: By Andrew H. Malcolm

DATELINE: NORWALK, Conn.

 BODY:
IT'S probably the fault of Nan Haavik's parents. They were always so darned involved, speaking out and writing mayors and Congressmen as if individual citizens mattered and had a responsibility to contribute a little something to their community.
We now realize that's old-fashioned and silly, of course, like knowing everyone in your neighborhood and keeping an eye out for one another. What possible difference could one person make in the face of overpowering urban realities? (It might even be dangerous.) Today's silent common wisdom recognizes decay as virtually inevitable in cities, especially in an age when budgets are cut before they're assembled. Who needs the frustration? Who has the time? 
 Mrs. Haavik does.
"I'm a pusher," she says. (No, not that kind.) "You always need someone who's deaf to every reason why something can't be done." It all started a few years ago when she faithfully followed her son's teams into schools in surrounding suburbs. "They were all so clean and bright," Mrs. Haavik recalled, "as if someone cared."
Such was not always the case here at their son's school, Brien McMahon High School. The school, named for a United States senator who died of cancer in 1952, opened eight years later. McMahon High had a hard-working staff by all accounts, but it's hard to focus community spirit without a snappy mascot. (What kind of inspiring logo do teams called the Senators use -- a well-dressed man with his hand out?) It struggled to find an identity other than as Norwalk's other high school. There were rising enrollments, which stressed the sprawling West Side building and then declining enrollments, two-career families and unemployment to weaken involvements.
Like many schools, McMahon showed wear. Visitors were greeted by a red Coca-Cola machine. The long halls were lined with abandoned trophy cases and cement block walls painted institutional green. With so many problems, redecorating hallways didn't burst to the top of the priority list. But few seemed to notice.
"Nan," said Roz McCarthy, one of many McMahon parents who have been organized and volunteered by Mrs. Haavik, "became our organizer extraordinaire."
"It's like your own home," said Mrs. Haavik, a tax accountant and longtime Parents Club board member. "You don't see the dirt or wear until company is coming. I know this can seem unimportant in education. But it's part of a good education, teaching values, creating an atmosphere conducive to growth and learning."
The first project: Fixing the entrance. Many parents didn't see the point; some kids, being kids, would just mess it up. Why bother? Mrs. Haavik changed her name to Pollyanna. "Sure, there's wear and tear," she said at one meeting. "But if you give in to the worst, then we're all pulled down to the lowest level."
With the administration's enthusiastic endorsement, Mrs. Haavik organized a team of painting parents. But wait just one minute. Was this maintenance painting or decorative painting? Because, you see, there are union rules against parents doing maintenance painting.
Mrs. Haavik decided this was definitely decorative painting.
And was this fire-retardant paint? (She found a paint-dealer parent who assured her it was.) And who's paying the janitor required when school doors are open? (She made an alliance with the school's scheduling secretary to paint during team and band practices.) She also sought advice from custodians, who became eager helpers. Suddenly, useful equipment and new display cases appeared.
One parent who is an artist drew symbols for 16 school sports, which were painstakingly traced along the walls and then hand-painted over and over by more Nan-volunteered parents. The other day Mrs. McCarthy, Lynne Pratt and Lucie Sasaki-Scanlon painted music and arts symbols by those classrooms. The school entrance became a student art gallery.
One secret Saturday a band of guerrilla gardeners attacked the grounds, run by a different city department. The land was weeded and trimmed before anyone could object. One month after Mrs. Haavik spent 10 hours on the phone, a city crew fixed a shattered wooden bench.
"In a large troubled city like this," Mrs. Haavik said, "three boards in one bench seem unimportant. But they're very important in a school's small family. When something looks wrong, it feeds the decay."
Here's something really radical: Mrs. Haavik even took to thanking people afterward. Guess what? They proved happier to help the next time.
Next comes the green cafeteria and gym, probably under the leadership of Mrs. Pratt, whose garage up on Farm Creek Road is fast filling with ladders and buckets.
"Change isn't simple," Mrs. Haavik said, "even when it's for the better. There's lots of fear. I just try to make my path the path of least resistance, to show the world somebody cares. It's contagious."
But what's her most important lesson from being a civic catalyst? "You always need someone saying, 'Yes, yes, it is possible.' "
Might that work elsewhere? It is possible.

Kraft Plans To Cut Prices To Grocers

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
Kraft General Foods Inc., the nation's largest food company, said yesterday that it planned to cut the prices it charges grocers for some products and reduce spending on promotional campaigns to bring consistently lower prices to consumers.
The move follows a similar action by the Procter & Gamble Company, which, since last fall, has cut prices to grocers on 40 percent of its products and has slashed spending on coupons and promotional allowances paid to grocers. Among the Procter products affected are Folger's coffee and Ivory dishwashing soap.
 
Too Much Spending
 
 Analysts said yesterday that the two food companies were acting out of growing frustration with the huge level of spending on promotional payments to grocers in recent years.
A recent survey by Nielsen Marketing Research found that food companies spend nearly 60 percent of their total advertising budgets on trade promotions. There is a growing concern that promotional spending is an ineffective way to build brand loyalty for a product.
"There is a tremendous amount of waste in the way that they have marketed," Walter K. Levy, a retailing consultant in New York, said regarding food companies' efforts.
Food companies pay a range of fees to grocers, including payments for simply making room for a new product on the shelves.
Joseph P. Durrett, the senior vice president of sales for Kraft General Foods, which is a unit of the Philip Morris Companies, called the pricing change "an experiment" that would not affect many of company's products initially. He said some of the new prices would take effect in several months, but he would not identify the products.
"We will approach it on a category-by-category basis," Mr. Durrett said. Kraft's products include Oscar Mayer and Louis Rich processed meats, Kool-Aid soft drinks and Kraft cheeses and salad dressings.
In the grocery trade, the new pricing strategy is referred to as "everyday low pricing."
Some grocers, who profit from promotional payments made by food companies, have resisted P.& G.'s new pricing structure, and it has been unclear whether Procter can make the new approach stick. But Kraft's decision to test a similiar program adds considerably more weight.
In the last 10 years, companies have tried to wean grocers off deals with limited success. "With Kraft General Foods coming, it's probably going to stick this time," said a food executive at a medium-sized company who asked not to be named.
 
Many Fees
 Among the fees collected by grocers are slotting allowances for stocking a company's products. Separate fees are paid to get a product displayed prominently in a store. Manufacturers also frequently sell their products at reduced prices for several weeks, allowing grocery chains and wholesalers to buy months' worth of products at lower prices and then sell them for greater profits when the deal period ends.
The practice leads to wild swings in supermarket prices. Marketing experts say the emphasis on deals has brought a reduction in brand loyalty, as consumers simply buy whatever is on sale.
Kraft General Foods, based in Glenview, Ill., notified a group of important customers, including executives of several large grocery chains, of the pricing change at a reception in Florida last weekend.
Mr. Durrett said he did not want to disrupt the company's relationship with the grocers and wholesalers who buy Kraft's product. "There are some giant issues here," he said.
 
Consistent Pricing
 While food companies do not set retail prices, they hope that offering one consistent price to grocers will lead to a more stable price at retail.
Also, it will make production easier for Procter & Gamble, which is based in Cincinnati. Rather than producing a four-months' supply of Jif peanut butter, for example, to sell at a special price in a certain month, the company can set a regular production cycle.
Food experts say Procter will take some of the money it saved by cutting promotional spending and shift it to television and newspaper advertising. The company would not confirm the shift yesterday, although a spokeswoman said, "We firmly believe that superior products, supported by strong advertising, build healthy brand franchises over time."
The Kraft move comes after a disappointing year for its food business in the United States. At a presentation to analysts in Florida yesterday, Philip Morris's chief executive, Michael A. Miles, said the recession would continue to "pose challenges" for the company's American businesses for the first half of the year.

Sheraton to Pay $160 Million In Hotel Deal With Marriot

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
The ITT Sheraton Corporation said yesterday that it had agreed to buy six hotels and lease two from the Marriott Corporation for $160 million.
Among the hotels Sheraton will buy is the Prince de Galles, a 170-room operation in Paris, which will be Sheraton's first hotel in that city. 
 Sheraton will also buy all-suite hotels in Alexandria, Va; Columbus, Ohio; Dallas; Kansas City, Mo., and Wilimington, Del. It will lease all-suite hotels in Deerfield and Elk Grove, Ill. All the hotels are two to three years old.
 
Suite Hotels Favored
 John Kapioltas, chairman, president and chief executive of Sheraton, said his company wanted to expand the number of all-suite hotels it owned. This type of hotel, in which rooms have living rooms and kitchens in addition to bedrooms, are favored by business travelers and families, he said, and have higher occupancy rates than regular hotels.
Sheraton, which has 420 hotels in 62 countries, has only three all-suite hotels now, in Atlanta, Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, and Plantation, Fla. Mr. Kapioltas said the suite hotel in Plantation had an occupancy rate of 82 percent, compared with about 64 percent for the entire chain.
Marriott said it would use the proceeds from the deal to pay down its debt of about $2 billion, much of which was amassed in an ambitious expansion. The chain, which manages more than 600 hotels, typically builds hotels, sells them to investors and continues to manage them. But with the recession holding down travel, the industry has an overcapacity of rooms, and Marriott has been forced to sell some hotels to pay down debt. In December, it sold 14 hotels and 110 restaurants.
Mr. Kapioltas of Sheraton said his company was expanding because it was a good time to buy properties whose prices were depressed.
"We're taking advantage of the good buys out there," he said. He added that the company preferred not to build hotels but wanted to buy recently built hotels, instead.
Although the industry's occupancy rate last year dropped by 40 to 50 percent because of the recession and the gulf war, Sheraton, based in Boston, managed operating income of $38 million on revenues of $717 million.
Mr. Kapioltas said that business this year in Europe was poor, that Latin American was strong and that the Middle East had recovered. He said the company's occupancy rate so far had been between 70 percent and 74 percent.
The Sheraton chain has done better in the recession than many others because it has hotels in many parts of the world. Marriott, on the other hand, suffered with its strategy.
As one of the high-fliers in the 1980's, it used borrowing, limited partnerships and other deals to build hotels and then sell them to groups of investors for large profits. It kept its hand in the till, earning fees to manage the hotels under long-term contracts.
The recession and the war, however, dried up the supply of potential investors, and the company was left with a large amount of unsold property and huge interest costs on its debt.

HEADLINE: Bay Banks to Help People Misled on Loans

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
In the first settlement of its kind, a large Boston banking company, Bay Banks Inc., has agreed to increase its lending in low-income neighborhoods and make reparations to homeowners who were misled by home-improvement contractors operating with Bay Banks' approval.
Various home-improvement schemes have been reported in a number of cities around the country. In the Boston area they worked this way: contractors put pressure on homeowners in low-income neighborhoods to borrow money from Bay Banks for home repairs and sign loan documents the homeowners had not read or did not understand. The contractors are accused of quoting amounts that homeowners would have to repay, without explaining how interest charges would greatly increase the total that would have to be paid. Elderly and minority homeowners were the most common victims. 
 The settlement was the first time that a bank has accepted responsibility for the misdeeds of contractors who arranged bank financing to help consumers pay for home improvements, according to the lawyers for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc. and the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, two groups who negotiated the agreement.
About 11,000 homeowners who took Bay Banks' home improvement loans between Nov. 15, 1987, and Feb. 19, 1992, are eligible for various benefits under the agreement. Depending on the harm they suffered, the interest rate on their loans, usually about 14 percent, may be reduced to zero, 6 percent or 9 percent, and they may be eligible for reduced payments for construction work that was improperly performed or grossly overpriced.
Borrowers may also be eligible for payments of $100 to $1,000 because terms of their home improvement loans were not properly disclosed. Although Bay Banks said the loan documents signed by the consumers properly described the rate and dollar amount of interest payments, lawyers representing Boston consumers said salespeople working for contractors had often misrepresented the contracts in oral descriptions. "Many of these customers were unsophisticated or illiterate," said Penda D. Hair, a lawyer for the Legal Defense Fund.
 
Changes Are Planned
 Richard F. Pollard, chairman of Bay Banks, acknowledged yesterday that there were problems with the way contractors did business and said the bank was moving toward a system in which it would make home-improvement loans only with consumers. "In the past few years, when times got tougher, I think some of the people working for the contractors began pushing harder," he said in an interview.
"We are the dominant home-improvement lender in the area," Mr. Pollard said, "and this is a product for which there is good demand, but which we couldn't adequately control using the contractors."
The agreement also calls for Bay Banks to provide $5 million of new home improvement loans at an interest rate 3.5 percentage points below normal, or about 9 percent currently. Bay Banks, which has been rated satisfactory by banking regulators for its compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act, also agreed to increase by $6 million, to $16 million, the money it would provide to the Massachusetts Housing Investment Corporation for building low- and moderate-income housing.

HEADLINE: Bill Set for Mild Curb on Car Imports

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 20

 BODY:
The chairman of the Senate subcommittee on trade says he will announce legislation on Friday calling for mild restrictions on sales of Japanese cars, in part to head off stronger protectionist bills now being proposed.
Senator Max S. Baucus, the Montana Democrat and free-trade advocate who heads the Subcommittee on International Trade, said in an interview that he considered the passage of some restrictions likely. 
 His new willingness to accept some limits signals the changing mood in Congress as it responds to the lingering recession, Japan's persistent trade surplus and the rise of protectionist sentiments across the nation.
Tighter restrictions on Japanese car makers, Mr. Baucus said, are "likely, given the political currents, Americans worried about jobs, election year."
 
Mood Swings
 Many senators and representatives still contend that the passage of legislation remains unlikely. "The mood in Congress changes with the occasion; it hypers up and then it cools off," Senator Frank H. Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, said today. "I don't think a consensus is building."
Representative Jim Leach, Republican of Iowa, was more cautious, contending that how well Japan adheres to voluntary agreements negotiated during President Bush's trip to Tokyo last month would determine whether Congress passes protectionist legislation this year.
"If the Japanese don't walk the extra mile to support and more than support the modest agreements the President enacted, Congress could well pass country-specific legislation in the guise of more generalist legislation," he said.
The Administration has repeatedly threatened to veto protectionist legislation, and Democrats have yet to overturn any veto by President Bush. White House trade officials declined to comment on Mr. Baucus's proposal until they saw the details.
The Democratic chairmen of the House trade subcommittee and Ways and Means Committee both oppose import limits, and together with Mr. Bush are likely to prevent protectionist bills from becoming law, said Representative Don J. Pease, an Ohio Democrat on the trade subcommittee.
Mr. Baucus proposes to cap Japanese auto makers' sales of imported and American-made cars at the 1991 level of 3.6 million vehicles. His bill would require improvements in American car quality -- as measured by the quality standards applied to applicants for the Commerce Department's annual Baldrige Awards -- as a condition for the renewal of the car sales limit every two years.
Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., Democrat of Michigan; Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the majority leader from Missouri; and four House Democrats from Michigan suggested tighter restrictions on Dec. 20. They proposed that Japanese auto sales be reduced by 250,000 cars each year through 1996 that the trade deficit with Japan does not shrink by at least 20 percent.
The Commerce Department announced today that this deficit widened last year to $43.4 billion from $41.1 billion, the first such increase since 1987.
Mr. Baucus's move is particularly surprising because he has opposed protectionism and his state, Montana, does not make cars. He joined Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who is chairman of the Finance Committee, in successfully leading last year's legislative battle to give President Bush the authority to negotiate a free-trade agreement with Mexico. And he led a group of seven farm-state Democratic Senators who crossed party lines last summer to support the President's renewal of China's preferential trade status.
The new proposal by Mr. Baucus would require the Administration to persuade the Japanese Government to restrain its companies' car sales for a series of two-year periods. Japan has participated in recent, so-called voluntary restraint arrangements, or V.R.A.'s, with the United States in the steel and machine tool industries, while Japanese auto makers have limited their exports to the United States without the explicit participation of the Japanese Government.
The United States current limit of 2.3 million cars from Japan has no direct effect because Japan sends only 1.8 million. Annual sales of another 1.8 million cars by Japanese-owned factories in the United States are not restricted.
Mr. Baucus said that his bill was not protectionist because of the condition that American auto makers improve their own quality. "There is no doubt that whenever there is a V.R.A., the American consumer pays a price," he said, because domestic and foreign auto makers are able to charge more when fewer cars are available. "That's why in return the American industry has got to invest and retrain."
He added that voluntary restrictions by the Japanese without his legislation would risk padding the pockets of American auto makers, and their shareholders, without forcing new investments.

Australia's Angst On U.S. Behavior

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
AUSTRALIANS consider themselves among the staunchest friends and allies of the United States, having fought beside Americans in World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam and the Persian Gulf. But during a swing from Melbourne to Sydney to Brisbane and Cairns, this reporter found Australians giving vent to their worries and frustrations about America's political and economic behavior.
Australians' anxieties about the United States are intensified by Australia's own recession -- the deepest in 60 years. Unemployment rose to a postwar rate of more than 10 percent in recent months. Business investment has fallen sharply, as the roaring boom of the 80's went bust. 
 And the farm sector has been battered by falling wool prices, a severe drought and continuing woes over low wheat prices and a loss of foreign markets for wheat, which the Australians attribute to the high export subsidies of Europe and the United States.
During President Bush's recent visit to Australia, where he was expecting a warm welcome before the tough bargaining in Japan, he was met by demonstrations of farmers protesting America's Export Enhancement Program. Mr. Bush, meeting with a delegation of farmers, sought to convince them that the United States was fighting on their side to eliminate all export subsidies in the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations but had to keep its own subsidies until the Europeans dropped theirs. The Australians said they would be just as dead if they were hit by "friendly fire" from the Americans.
Mr. Bush promised he would order his aides to study carefully this country's export subsidies and consult with the Australians to forestall any actions that might damage their interests. The Australians don't feel that the United States is keeping that commitment.
They point, in particular, to an American offer in late January, after the President's visit, of 200,000 tons of wheat to Yemen, on which they say they were not informed or consulted. John Robson, Deputy Secretary of the United States Treasury, said in an interview that there were "alleged" problems with the Australians over the Export Enhancement Program.
But Australians' concerns go far beyond the specific issue of wheat subsidies. They fear that the United States is moving away from trade liberalization toward restrictions to protect specific industries.
"Is there a retreat from globalism, and where will the Presidential campaigns fit into this?" asked Jim Gale, an economic consultant in Sydney. The New Hampshire campaign deepened anxieties on that score, not only because Patrick Buchanan ran on the slogan "America First" but because President Bush and the five Democratic candidates shied away from all foreign policy issues.
The Australians see a danger that the world is splitting into three major trade blocs, in Europe, the Americas and Asia. The Australians fear that too much of the relationship between the United States and Japan, on one side, and between the United States and Western Europe, on the other, was built on Soviet containment for it to survive the end of the cold war. They want to know what effect a fracturing of the Japan-United States links would have on the Asia-Pacific region, and they are made nervous by the American agreement to give up its bases in the Philippines.
"What role does America see for itself in the Asia Pacific basin as a whole?" asked one business executive.
To safeguard their own interests, the Australians are increasingly seeking to orient their economy toward the Asian region. "We are Europeans in an Asian setting," said one Australian diplomat, "and we must adapt our way of thinking." In the Asian configuration, Australia has been called the odd man out, but Foreign Minister Gareth Evans said, "We are odd man in."
Yet Australia does not want to give up its ties with the United States or Europe. Just from the standpoint of its bargaining position and economic interests, it would prefer to pursue a global strategy, with access to all markets, rather than being locked up in a single region.
Australians see the preservation and growth of an open world economy as basically dependent on the ability of the United States to strengthen its own economy and provide a base for its global leadership. But the pressures of the election campaign on the candidates could worsen American economic imbalances.
If global economic stability and security are still predicated to some extent on American leadership and military power, Australians are asking, what effect will a decline in United States domestic confidence have on the expression of that leadership?
It is up to the Presidential candidates -- and the American voters -- to provide the answer.

Palmeiro Wins His Case And $3.85 Million Salary

 BODY:
The Texas Rangers suffered their second major economic blow in two days yesterday when RAFAEL PALMEIRO won his salary arbitration case and a $3.85 million salary, extending the most significant stretch players ever have had in arbitration.
Palmeiro's salary is the third largest gained in an arbitration hearing, and all three were determined in the space of three days. GILBERT VERNON, who heard arguments Wednesday, chose Palmeiro's figure over the Rangers' $2.35 million, placing the Texas first baseman behind his outfielder teammate RUBEN SIERRA ($5 million) and Mets pitcher DAVID CONE ($4.25 million). The difference between the winning and losing salaries in the three cases totaled $3.95 million. 
 The difference between the salaries the Rangers wanted to pay and what Sierra and Palmeiro received was $2.7 million.
Palmeiro, who batted .322 and hit 26 home runs while earning $1,475,000 last year, was the last of 71 American League players who filed for arbitration to conclude his case. They emerged from the procedure with an aggregate pay raise of 114 percent, going from an average of $671,724 to $1,441,092.

Holbein Sale
Christie's announcement last week that it plans to sell Hans Holbein's "Lady With a Squirrel and a Starling" on April 15 in London has become the focus of a debate about how Britain can protect its national treasures without undermining free trade. The issue is urgent because of the closer economic integration the European Community is to adopt at the end of the year. The sale has revived a drive to establish a list of national treasures that may not be removed from the country, a procedure similar to those in other countries, like France.
Experts say the painting could bring a record auction price for a Holbein, about $25 million. It is a 21-by-15-inch portrait of an Englishwoman painted during Holbein's first stay in England, from 1526 to 1528. Directors of England's national museums say that it is a national treasure and that they were not given a chance to buy it before it was consigned to Christie's.
Meanwhile, the Marquess of Cholmondeley, who is selling the Holbein, maintains that the price is way beyond any of the English museums' budgets anyway. Lord Cholmondeley inherited a fortune estimated at more than $170 million in 1990, but he says his income is not enough to maintain his two estates, Cholmondeley in Cheshire and Houghton Hall in Norfolk, where the painting has hung since 1780. He says the proceeds from the sale will be used for that purpose.
In last week's announcement, Christie's also said that in the same auction it would sell "The Old Horse Guards From St. James's Park," by Canaletto, which is estimated to bring about $5 million, and "Daniel and Cyrus Before the Idol of Bel," dated 1633, by Rembrandt, which may fetch about $13 million. These rare artworks coming up for sale simultaneously has only increased the outcry by people in the English art world who are worried that owners of stately homes are rushing to sell their prized possessions before the Government can issue a list of works that may not be exported.
"There's a certain nervousness," said Lord Gowrie, a former Arts Minister who is the chairman of Sotheby's in London. "The changing of the European Community rules, the upcoming elections and a big drop in agricultural income are all reasons people are thinking of selling art right now. It's only natural they want to sell before any changes are announced."
What the British art world fears most is that the rich J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif., or a private collector from outside Britain will buy the Holbein. Museum experts in the United States refused to talk for attribution, saying only that bidding on the painting might be more trouble than the work is worth. They fear that the British Government's review Committee on Export Works of Art would prevent the painting from leaving London and that if the Holbein does leave England, the bad publicity could bring changes in Britain's export laws.
Neil MacGregor, director of the National Gallery in London, refused to talk to the press about the Holbein but issued a statement calling it "one of the greatest of Holbein's works of this kind" and saying, "Its retention in this country is therefore of great importance." Mr. MacGregor went on to write that Lord Cholmondeley made clear that unless $25 million "could be produced at once, the sale would go ahead in April." The sum is well beyond the museum's annual purchase grant from the Government, which is less than $5 million.
While Lord Cholmondeley refused to be interviewed, he wrote a letter published last week in The Daily Telegraph in response to Mr. MacGregor. In it he said: "We did discuss with Neil MacGregor and the Director of the National Heritage Memorial Fund the possibility of a private treaty sale. They agreed that even the minimum figure required would be out of reach of their combined purses. However, the door remains open." He added that "while I deplore the lack of Government funding for museums, I feel that owners of works of art should not be blamed for trying to achieve fair prices, especially, as in our case, when the proceeds will be used to preserve another, undoubtedly more vital part of the national heritage: one of the greatest historic houses, Houghton Hall in Norfolk and its collection of furniture and paintings."
Timothy Clifford, director of the National Gallery in Edinburgh, said: "In the end I don't think the British will let it out of the country. But I can understand Lord Cholmondeley's point of view. He wants as much money as possible." The National Gallery in Edinburgh has an unparalleled collection of works by Titian and Poussin on loan from the Duke of Sutherland, and Mr. Clifford is concerned that what happens to the Holbein may set a precedent for what could happen to the Duke's paintings if the Duke ever considers selling them.
Mr. Clifford suggested that several national museums in Britain buy the painting together and share it.
Christie's was prepared for the uproar. Predictably, it is trying to divorce itself from the debate. "We knew it would attract a lot of attention," said Noel Annesley, deputy chairman of Christie's International "The auction house is only acting as agents not advisers. Lord Cholmondeley has been debating about the sale of the Holbein for two years and decided to push the button now."
Lord Gowrie said: "It's important that the Government should step in. But as a nation we're prone to crying wolf, to say that everything's important and a national treasure. The only problem is that this time I think it's true."
 
Fakes Are Everywhere
 "Of course we have fakes: every museum does," said Marian Burleigh-Motley, who runs the education division at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. "People should be more aware of what fakes mean and know what to look for." As a result, Ms. Burleigh-Motley has organized a series of eight lectures on Tuesday nights using fakes from the Metropolitan's collections. The series, called "Understanding Fakes," runs from March 10 to April 28. Each week different members of the museum's curatorial and conservation staff will explore such subjects as the definition of a fake, motives for producing fakes and changing tastes in fakery.
"We will also be showing new techniques for determining that things are not original," Ms. Burleigh-Motley said. The series costs $70; individual lectures are $10. Information: (212) 570-3949.
 
Recession in London
 London art dealers have been as hard hit by the recession as those in New York City. Fischer Fine Art Ltd., the 30-year-old King Street gallery, is closing at the end of April. The gallery handled such artists as Henry Moore, Gustav Klimt and Egon Schiele, as well as Viennese Secession Art and Design and German Expressionism. "If the landlord had reduced the rent, we might have been able to ride out the recession," said Wolfgang Fischer, the owner.
The Odette Gilbert, a gallery that has been on Cork Street nine years, has already closed. It specialized in modern and contemporary British artists like Lucian Freud, Eurbach Kossof, Tom Edwards and Sandra Fisher. "It's been so quiet, it wasn't worth being open," said Odette Gilbert. "Lots of other contemporary galleries are closing too."

The Clock Strikes 12 Years for Heroes of '80

BYLINE: By GERALD ESKENAZI, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LA LECHERE, France, Feb. 20

 BODY:
It's not the same.
Herb Brooks knows it. Jim Craig, who draped himself in the flag, knows it. Mike Eruzione and Ken Morrow are enthralled, but they, too, know it. 
 And yet, there is a romantic notion growing here and in America that the magic of 1980 will be revived.
It is a wonderfully odd, theatrical coincidence. On Friday at 5 P.M. the United States hockey team faces the more highly regarded former Soviet squad in the Olympic semifinals.
Remember 1980? The United States hockey team, unheralded, the youngest squad at Lake Placid, N.Y., took on the Soviets, the original Big Red Machine. It was a semifinal game, 5 P.M., on a Friday. Even the date was almost the same: Feb. 22.
 
Similarities and Differences
 Like the current American squad, that team brought an undefeated record into the game. Like the current squad, that team had been tied by one opponent, Sweden.
But there are also plenty of differences between that American team and this one. The 1980 United States squad was a collection of college kids; this one includes older players, including several N.H.L. veterans.
In 1980, America was doubting itself, its hostages being held in Iran. The opponent on the ice was a team representing a foreign power many Americans saw as a threat. Nevertheless, the 1980 squad had one big advantage: It was playing at home.
In 1992, Americans have doubts again: about the economy's ability to rebound, about their place in the global marketplace. But the 1980 Olympians figure the parallels stop there, and stop short.
 
How Craig Sees It
 Jim Craig is selling advertising space for newspapers these days, a more prosaic role than 12 years ago when, as the goalie on the American team, he became a national hero after the United States stunned the Soviet squad, 4-3.
"What happened is different," he contended as he spoke on the telephone from Winthrop, Mass. "If you take it in perspective, for us it was a vehicle, an uplifting time for our country. Now, 12 years later, the game is changed. The Unified Team plays a little like us now. They dump the puck in. They play the body. They take more shots."
Yet, Craig also sees a similarity. The American goalie, Ray LeBlanc, is hot. "He's like the quarterback or the pitcher," he said. "You need someone to take charge."
Craig sees the Americans now as "professionals, older guys."
"And the Russians aren't even the Russians," he said. "When we played them, they were the ones we copied."
Now, he says of the team representing part of the former Soviet Union, "I don't think they're as team-oriented. They play wide-open. They're playing for an N.H.L. contract."
Morrow was a lanky defenseman on the 1980 American squad. After the Olympics he joined the New York Islanders, and within a few months he had added a Stanley Cup title to his gold medal.
Now an Islanders assistant coach, he recalled from Uniondale, L.I., how Brooks hauled out his famous "Brooksisms" before the game against the Soviet Union.
"That's when he said, 'You were born to be hockey players. You were born to be here,' " Morrow said.
Morrow's advice to the 1992 Americans? "You've got to take each shift as if it's your last," he said. "You lose and you're eliminated."
In the small upstate New York village of Lake Placid, playing in a small arena, Morrow and his teammates didn't realize the impact they had on American life when they beat the Soviet squad. Two days later, the United States team beat Finland to win the gold.
"The next day, we were shocked," Morrow said. "We flew to Washington. We saw thousands of people lining the route. People still tell me beating the Russians was the greatest moment of their life. I have to pinch myself to realize I was part of it."
 
Eruzione on the Scene, Again
 Of all of those young Americans, Mike Eruzione perhaps realized best he could never top that moment. He scored the winning goal against the Soviet team. He ended his hockey career after the gold-medal game against Finland. Now he is here, doing commentary for CBS.
"I'm trying -- as crazy as this might sound -- not to intrude," he said. "This is their moment. But it's a totally different Soviet team and they don't carry the aura those did."
In 1980, Brooks dined with Ken Dryden the night before the showdown with the Soviet Union. Dryden, the former goalie for the Montreal Canadiens, was serving as the hockey analyst for ABC.
"You want to play a smart defensive game, an emotional game," Dryden told him.
Brooks knew he would have the crowd with him. He knew the Soviet team would outshoot his players. He wanted to keep it close. Dryden suggested more ice time for the Iron Range guys: the Minnesota trio of Buzz Schneider, John Harrington and Mark Pavelich.
The next day, Schneider scored the first goal against Vladislav Tretiak, the finest goalie the Soviet team ever suited up.
The Soviet Union went ahead, 2-1, but with one second remaining in the opening period, Mark Johnson tied the game. Angry, Soviet Coach Viktor Tikhonov (who now coaches the Unified Team) took out Tretiak and put in Vladimir Myshkin.
The Soviets went ahead, 3-2, in the second period, but in the final session the Americans tied the score on a somewhat soft goal, and then Eruzione beat Myshkin with the shot that was to define his future.
Brooks was trying to sound diplomatic the other day from Utica, N.Y., where he is coaching the New Jersey Devils farm team. Brooks and diplomacy are words that do not fit easily into the same sentence.
He was sought as the coach for the current Olympic squad. But the job ending up going to Dave Peterson.
"Parallels?" said Brooks. "There are no parallels. I don't see a dominant team in these Games."
One can sense he wants to tell everyone that he was working with college kids while Peterson has experienced professionals, especially on defense, and one hot goalie who is a career minor leaguer.
And Brooks does not say that this is the former Soviet B team, as good as it is, but with most of the best players having turned pro in the West.
"This has been a six-team race," he said. "It's been entertaining and interesting because of the parity. In a lot of ways, more competitive than 1980. We've got great team speed, as good a chance as anybody, and they're riding a hot goalie. But they've got to cut their shots-against down."
So, Herb, it's not the same?
"Times change," he said.

HEADLINE: Where's the Rest of Him?

 BODY:
Patrick Buchanan calls his showing in New Hampshire the beginning of a "middle-class revolution" with himself starring in the role once played by Ronald Reagan. He thus grandiosely misconstrues voter anger over tough times as a mandate for his eccentric brand of conservatism. That's fanciful thinking, made possible because Mr. Buchanan put only some of himself on display.
"Where's the Rest of Me?" is how his paragon, Ronald Reagan, titled his autobiography, quoting some famous movie dialogue. It's a question Pat Buchanan now needs to answer about himself. 
 Mr. Buchanan came within 16 points of President Bush in New Hampshire, not as close as first appeared, but impressive nevertheless considering that he's a newspaper columnist who has never run for anything. The question is, what does his 37 percent mean?
Half of those who voted for him told exit poll interviewers that they did so to send the President a message, presumably about how hard the recession has hit them. And half the Buchanan voters said they were unsatisfied with both Republicans.
With attitudes like that apparent, any idea of a Buchanan "revolution" is mainly a fiction in the candidate's mind. The nagging questions after New Hampshire are these: Was the reasonable Patrick Buchanan who campaigned there also a fiction? Where was the rest of him -- the angry chauvinist who says "America First" without embarrassment at the slogan's Nazi connotations? Where was the polemicist so quick to deride "Zulus" and supporters of the Persian Gulf war?
The Patrick Buchanan who shook hands across New Hampshire did not hide his foreign-policy views. He touted retrenchment and argued for supplanting Mr. Bush's "globalism" with a "new nationalism."
But on other issues, Patrick Buchanan, the arch conservative, seems to have sat out the campaign. He who not long ago went out of his way to offend Jews when talking about the Middle East now discusses the subject decently, calmly. The Patrick Buchanan who said that black lives are more expendable than white was nowhere seen on the campaign trail.
His record suggests someone intent on bringing out the worst in people, preying on fear of foreigners and minorities. For instance, he crossed the line recently in The London Sunday Telegraph when he argued that America should be sympathetic to independence in the Baltic states because they are populated by white people:
"Why are we more shocked when a dozen people are killed in Vilnius than a massacre in Burundi?" he asked, "Because they are white people. That's who we are. That's where America comes from." Millions of Americans who are not Anglo-Saxon are right to be alarmed by a candidate for President who thinks their lives less valuable than his own.
Mr. Buchanan expressed himself with similar, perhaps even anti-Semitic fervor, in his opposition to the gulf war. All the fighting would be done by "kids with names like McAllister, Murphy, Gonzales and Leroy Brown," he said, while those who were "beating the drums" for war in the Middle East were "the Israeli Defense Ministry and its amen corner in the United States," as though the war had only Jewish supporters.
Mr. Buchanan surely realized that his candidacy would burn up if he continued such inflammatory pronouncements. But it defeats logic for him, having suppressed his extreme views during the campaign, now to claim that New Hampshire voters endorsed them. The real Patrick Buchanan has yet to reconcile the sober candidate of the last 60 days with the intolerant sloganeer of the last 20 years.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Buchanan's Free Ride

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
They did not create Patrick Buchanan's victory in New Hampshire -- the recession and the Administration's long lost-weekend case of economic staggers did that. But suddenly stricken with pusillanimous paralysis the press, politicians and President gave Mr. Buchanan a nice, comfortable, free ride on his way.
Wait, stay with this, even if you loathe the man. I have good news toward the end about fighting him. 
 But first: The press, which could spare armies of reporters and cameramen to track down every charge about a candidate's sexual adventures and hunt earnestly for examples yet uncovered, just couldn't spare a few bodies to probe into Mr. Buchanan's past.
I am not talking about secrets but his own words and attitudes, while on the Government's payroll or when masquerading as a journalist. What do they tell us about this man who wants to be President -- about his angers against blacks, Jews, gays and others not to his tastes, about his fondness for a variety of dictators, his disdain for Americans who think democracy is a way of life that the U.S. should try to encourage in the world?
Instead, reporters and editors allowed him to wave them off with breezy contempt and false denials on those occasions they did ask questions. Columnist friends and TV partners gathered their wagons, and counterattack weapons, around him. Other journalists got all choked up when Mr. Buchanan decided that there might be some votes in throwing the unemployed a few more benefit checks after all. Keep an eye out for more articles about the wiser, kinder, gentler Buchanan.
I don't relish slanging away at journalists. But it has to be said that over all, in print and on the air, the coverage of Patrick Buchanan, a man who came out of the dark shadows of the America First past and wants to drag us back into them, was the mushiest, most protective and unprofessional since his idol, Senator Joseph McCarthy, bulldozed his way right over the American press in the 50's. 
Maybe that's because journalists have a soft spot for "underdogs." Personally I don't care what kind of a dog a candidate is. I just want to be told if it is carrying fleas.
President Bush: He let Mr. Buchanan walk all over him. Worse, neither he nor his surrogates acted as if they had even heard of the regular Buchananite nastinesses about Dr. Martin Luther King, small "d" democrats, Jews dragging the U.S. into war, and his anti-gay rantings, on and on.
Nor were there peeps from the Democratic candidates or almost-candidates. Et Mario, too. That hurts; maybe he forgot.
Now, the promised reward. In California, an elected Republican politician is showing the courage and intelligence needed to handle the Buchanans: say what they are, not behind the hand, not in embarrassment, but out loud as a matter of plain duty. He is Representative Tom Campbell, whose district includes the Silicon Valley and who is running for the U.S. Senate.
Before the New Hampshire primary vote, Mr. Campbell decided that "silence is unacceptable" and sent an unsolicited statement to the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, named after the great Nazi-hunter and working in his tradition.
The statement tears into Mr. Buchanan's "obsession" with Jews, his tenderness toward war criminals, his "bizarre revisionist claim" that the British let a million German P.O.W.'s die, his evil remark about the group "fantasies of martyrdom and heroism" of Holocaust survivors.
The Buchanans can be sent back to the shadows, the Louisiana way. Louisiana defeated David Duke through coalitions of whites, blacks, Jews, Christians, Republicans, Democrats, workers and businessmen, united by the determination that this man would not represent them.
It is past time for the press to do its job. It is past time for politicians and voters of both parties to put Buchananite assaults beyond acceptability.
"Protest votes" duck reality. On the phone, Mr. Campbell posed the issues in two questions:
Do Republicans want Patrick Buchanan to represent them as head of their party?
Do Republicans and Democrats want this man to be President of the United States?
Anything else is evasion.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN
Man in the News: Paul Ethemios Tsongas;
A Politician Who Thought He Could

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SIOUX CITY, S.D., Feb. 20

 BODY:
For Paul E. Tsongas, the defining moment of his victory in the New Hampshire primary didn't come on election night, nor in the sudden outpouring of support from Greek-Americans who had largely ignored him but at a rally Wednesday at Hopkins' Plaza in Baltimore.
"To walk onto that plaza and see all those people was not just another event," Mr. Tsongas said today in an interview. "This was a memory being made." The big turnout was special because Mr. Tsongas had campaigned in Maryland for only five days. 
 Once again, he had taken on a political challenge few thought he could meet, and he had done it.
Political analysts scoffed last April when he announced he would seek the Presidency. Another Greek from Massachusetts, with all the reminders of Michael S. Dukakis's disastrous 1988 campaign, could not be a viable candidate, they said.
In the final week of campaigning in New Hampshire, Mr. Tsongas joked with volunteers that their support showed that they had "no political instincts."
 
Reveling in Victory
 Wednesday morning he reveled in victory. "Thank you, New Hampshire, you've done it," he said before leaving for campaign stops in Baltimore and New York. "You've proven the pundits are wrong."
By the time he visited a Greek-American neighborhood in Astoria, Queens, on Wednesday his campaign, until recently a mom-and-pop operation, had begun to resemble an army in size, if not discipline. Nearly 6,000 people came out to meet him in Queens, forcing a candidate who likes to meet voters one-on-one into using a police escort in Astoria.
For most of of his 51 years, Mr. Tsongas has followed his own style, and confounded the naysayers doing it. "He was always determined to do things his way," his twin sister, Thaleia Schlesinger, said in an interview this week.
Paul Ethemios Tsongas was born Feb. 14, 1941, in Lowell, Mass., into a middle-class Greek immigrant family. The twins' mother, Katina, contracted tuberculosis shortly after their birth and died six and a half years later. Much of the time, she was in a sanitarium. "She could not touch us or be with us," said Mr. Tsongas.
 
Peace Corps Changes Life
 The children worked in the family dry-cleaning business, and Mr. Tsongas's father, a Republican, wanted his son to enter it when he graduated from Dartmouth College in 1962. Instead, he joined the Peace Corps. He has described his experiences in Ethiopia and the West Indies as "the crossroads of my life," one that gave him a sense of the value of public service.
Recalling how her brother defied their father, the candidate's sister said, "In a Greek family, growing up when we did, you just didn't do that."
After completing Yale Law School in 1967, Mr. Tsongas ran for the City Council in his hometown and won, serving from 1968 to 1972. In 1969 he also became deputy assistant state attorney general. When he decided to run for the House in 1973, no one expected him to win, but he did.
In 1978, again against the odds, he unseated Senator Edward Brooke, a Republican. He planned to run for re-election, and then for President, but in 1983 cancer interrupted his journey.
At the time his illness was diagnosed, there was no cure for the type of cancer he had, lymphoma. Mr. Tsongas said he never expected to live and feared that his young daughter would have only a distant memory of him, as he did of his mother.
 
Feeling a New Obligation
 In 1986, he beat the odds again, undergoing experimental bone-marrow treatment. He has been cancer-free since, and his doctor, Tak Takzorian, says only 5 percent of patients who survive the disease have any recurrence.
Dr. Takzorian told Mr. Tsongas that surviving cancer obligated a person to do something transcendent. In his battle with the disease, Mr. Tsongas had quit the Senate and set out to make money, joining the Boston law firm of Foley, Hoag & Eliot. He worked for clients like Drexel Burnham Lambert, the Wall Street investment firm that has since collapsed, and was a lobbyist for an oil company and other energy businesses, work that would draw criticism from environmentalists.
With his recovery, Mr. Tsongas began thinking again of politics, and Dr. Takzorian's words helped drive him to enter the race for President.
"These are not ordinary days," Mr. Tsongas said this week. "And there must be a purpose in these days."
Nor was that unusual talk for the candidate. At a recent town meeting in New Hampshire he said quietly: "So what is life? We all exist in this time and place. We are here together. For what reason? Not just to pursue our own individual desires."
If the candidate is aware that he has a sanctimonious side, he definitely has a down-to-earth side, as he showed Wednesday in New York City. "I'm not larger than life," he said, after being greeted by crowds in Astoria's Greek-American community. "But you can understand how this outpouring of affection and expectation can change you," he said.
Mr. Tsongas said he will be saved from that by his wife, Niki. Paul Tsongas and Niki Sauvage met at a party in Washington 22 years ago when he was a first-term Congressman. Within a month and a half, they were married.
The oldest of an Air Force colonel's four daughters, Mrs. Tsongas, 45, had grown up in West Germany and Japan, had worked for Senator Eugene J. McCarthy of Minnesota, who ran for President on an anti-war platform in 1968, and had just finished her junior year at Smith College. Now a lawyer whose partnership has just dissolved, she is a tireless campaigner for her husband.
"I married the right person," he said. "She keeps me grounded."
So does campaigning. Today, on the flight to South Dakota, Mr. Tsongas discovered that there had been a mixup: he was not going to address the South Dakota Legislature, as he had thought, but was scheduled to visit the Sioux City stockyards. So he held a press conference in a pig arena.
Mr. Tsongas has yet to learn how his diffident manner plays outside New England. The candidate said he didn't expect to win the South Dakota primary but wanted to give voters the opportunity to hear his message. But though there was a gaggle of reporters and photographers, there were only a handful of voters. And at The Stockyards Cafe across the street from where he stopped, no one wanted to hear his message. Clearly, they were mostly Republicans.
 
Why Change Now
 But Mr. Tsongas says he won't change his message, regardless of the audience. His sense of focus has allowed him, he says, to tell the "hard truth" to the country, emphasizing sacrifice to revive the economy.
When Mr. Tsongas said he was considering a run for the Presidency, he asked his wife and their three daughters what they thought.
Mrs. Tsongas says she never hesitated: "The mysterious twists and turns of our life have some internal sense. From day one, I felt this was possible."

CORRECTION-DATE: February 22, 1992, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
A "Man in the News" article yesterday about Paul E. Tsongas misstated his Congressional history. He was elected to the House of Representatives in 1974; he was not a first-term Congressman 22 years ago. The article also misstated the date when he met Niki Sauvage, his wife, and the length of their courtship. They met in 1967 and were married in 1969, two and a half years -- not a month and a half -- later. The article also had an erroneous dateline. It was written in Sioux Falls, S.D.

What Peace Dividend?

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
As campaign '92 heads south, Republicans and Democrats will no longer be able to ignore perhaps their most telling point of conflict: Democratic Presidential hopefuls propose cuts in U.S. military spending roughly three times greater than now projected by President Bush.
Mr. Bush's peace dividend -- or savings on previously planned defense outlays -- would total about $66 billion by 1997. 
 His Democratic opponents are calling for savings of between $180 billion and $200 billion by that date.
Almost as startling as this gap is the fact that even the Democratic candidates are talking about limited reductions. Their Pentagon budget five years from now would still be over $200 billion in today's dollars -- or about one-third the present budget. In other words, the much-touted peace dividend to produce extra dollars for domestic priorities and deficit reduction is turning out to be far smaller than anticipated.
And the peace dividend will be smaller still if Democratic leaders in Congress have their way. Their suggested cuts put them closer to Mr. Bush than to their own would-be party standard-bearers, an embarrassing fact that is just beginning to dawn on several of them.
Legislators, Democrats and Republicans, say they are worried that faster reductions will lead to swelling unemployment rolls. But the Pentagon is not supposed to be a jobs agency, and a particularly expensive one at that. Concerned legislators would better serve their country if they followed Senator Sam Nunn's lead and put their minds to creating new jobs for military personnel in education and new uses for unneeded military bases.
In any event, the size of the defense budget should be set relative to overall national priorities and a realistic judgment of external threats. On these counts, Democratic Presidential hopefuls make more sense than their Congressional counterparts and George Bush.
It is very hard to understand why military outlays cannot be reduced by at least one-third over the next five years. Until now, well over half of the defense budget has been devoted to countering Soviet threats. That country is now a fractured bunch of basket cases, begging to be allied with Washington.
Meanwhile, the Pentagon is thrashing around trying to justify a force that will be about 1.6 million strong, down from the present 2.1 million, by 1997. The Times published on Monday the results of that thrashing, a set of seven illustrative scenarios where the U.S. might be called upon to use military power.
It would be easy to make fun of these scenarios, but that would be unfair. The U.S. needs an effective and strong military, and the military has to think about situations where force may be likely.
But the striking thing about the Pentagon list is how far its planners had to stretch to come up with any plausible threats. A resurgent Iraq or an attack by North Korea on South Korea are practically off imaginable charts. And the U.S. along with its allies could deal with them crushingly with only a fraction of current military power, as happened in the Persian Gulf war. As for protecting American citizens in places like the Philippines or Panama, a few battalions and a few air squadrons could do the job easily. And as for worrying about some new world military power, none is near any horizon.
These comments oversimplify, to be sure. Pentagon planners have to think about length of combat, troop rotations, maintaining an industrial base and the like.
They are also in the business of selling insurance. The U.S. bought a great deal of insurance against Moscow for 40 years, mostly well spent. Americans paid the price not because they thought Moscow really would attack Europe or the U.S., but because the effects of Soviet military might had to be counterbalanced and because the actual use of that might would fundamentally damage American security. Currently imaginable threats to U.S. interests are trivial by comparison.
Democratic Presidential candidates have solid arguments for the one-third cuts in spending they propose, and should press their case harder. And Congressional Democrats should look again at their own position and do their part by pushing the Pentagon to justify its much higher spending projections. Otherwise the peace dividend will vanish in the usual "complexities" of Washington's political bazaar.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 24, 1992, Monday

 CORRECTION:
Because of a mechanical error, Friday's column incorrectly described Pentagon spending cuts proposed by the Democratic candidates. Their budgets in five years would be one-third less than the current Pentagon budget, not one-third the current budget.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Republicans;
CONSERVATIVES GET WARNING BY QUAYLE TO STAND BY BUSH

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 21

 BODY:
In one of its most direct efforts to undermine Patrick J. Buchanan's insurgency, the White House today dispatched Vice President Dan Quayle to warn Republican conservatives that if they work against President Bush they "risk being out of power for a generation."
Mr. Quayle argued that while the President was not "100 percent" conservative, to repudiate him would risk turning the Cabinet over to liberal jurists and advocates of abortion. The Vice President, who has long suffered ridicule, used ridicule to paint a Republican nightmare of a "national condom-distribution campaign for grades 7 and up." 
 As the 1992 campaign shapes up not only as a test of Mr. Bush, but also of who will lead the conservatives in 1996, Mr. Quayle put in a pitch for himself. In a speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference tonight, he said that re-electing the President would be preparation for another conservative victory in 1996, presumably with Mr. Quayle at the head of the ticket.
 
A Pragmatic Appeal
 The Vice President, the White House's primary link to the Republican right since the dismissal of John H. Sununu as White House chief of staff in December, sought to shelter Mr. Bush with the legacy of conservatives like Ronald Reagan and Barry Goldwater. But Mr. Quayle did not promise any changes in what conservatives believe are Mr. Bush's moderate policies and instead offered this pragmatic appeal: Mr. Buchanan cannot win, and backing him would hurt the party.
"The only real question facing us today is whether our President will enter the general election campaign from a position of strength or from a position of weakness," Mr. Quayle said.
He added: "Anyone has the right to wage a symbolic campaign. But it would be irresponsible to endanger all that we have achieved."
The audience gave the Mr. Quayle a warm reception, but it seemed more enthusiastic when he talked about the Persian Gulf war and the collapse of communism than when he talked about domestic issues. The Vice President was introduced by the Ambassador from Kuwait, Saud Nasir al-Sabah, who gave Mr. Bush what amounted to a political endorsement.
 
Only One 'Pat' Mentioned
 The Vice President did not mention Mr. Buchanan by name; the only "Pat" cited in the speech was Representative Patricia Schroeder, the Colorado Democrat.
The speech clearly represented a move by the White House and the Bush campaign to stanch the bleeding in the Republican Party as they try to find a way to put the President back on the offensive politically. Its tone of alarm ran counter to the official White House line that Mr. Buchanan is a minor annoyance, that Mr. Bush does not have to cater to the right to win re-election and that his candidacy was untouched by a weak showing in the New Hampshire primary.
"One of our supporters suggested to me that the New Hampshire vote might actually be a blessing in disguise," Mr. Quayle said. "And I could only think of Churchill: 'At the moment, it seems quite effectively disguised.' "
Republican conservatives said that Mr. Bush needed to court conservatives, but that sending Mr. Quayle to do it was not enough. "I think ultimately the argument won't carry the day," said Gary Bauer, president of the Family Research Council, an anti-abortion group.
He added: "They have it within their power to derail the Buchanan candidacy by doing a half-dozen or so conservative things. I'd make the budget director head of the campaign in American Samoa, for starters."
The budget director, Richard G. Darman, is widely disliked by conservatives for having kept a $500 increase in the income tax exemption for children off Mr. Bush's list of the seven most urgent economic measures. Mr. Bauer said that had hurt the President badly.
Mr. Quayle belittled conservatives who argue that a Democratic victory this year "would give the conservative movement a chance to renew and revitalize itself." Conservatives, he said, face "a choice: of continuing what we started or going back to the old bickering over who is 90 percent or who is 100 percent pure."
 
'The Liberals Are Coming'
 He added: "Meanwhile, the liberals are coming together, hell-bent on capturing the White House by whatever means possible. If we lose to them now we will risk being out of power for a generation."
The Vice President jokingly asked his audience to imagine a victorious Democrat naming former President Jimmy Carter as Secretary of State and Ralph Nader as Attorney General. He also offered these images:
*Kate Michelman, head of the National Abortion Rights Action League, is made Secretary of Health and Human Services with a program of "cradle-to-grave socialized medicine," anti-welfare reform programs, condom distribution and "a Federal right to abortion on demand."
*Mrs. Schroeder becomes Secretary of Defense, cuts $150 billion from the Pentagon budget and calls the "Star Wars" antimissile program "a nasty, nutty nightmare."
*In mid-March, "after a 30-minute hearing, a party-line vote confirms Laurence Tribe as the 107th Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States." Mr. Tribe, a Harvard law professor, is a bete noire of the conservatives.
Those mentioned by Mr. Quayle responded in kind.
"I don't believe this," Ms. Michelman said. "H.H.S.? I'm holding out for Vice President. Dan Quayle's proof anyone can do that job."
She added, "I think it is a sign of how far out of touch these guys are with Americans when they think that the need for comprehensive health care and support for the right to choose is a joke."
Calling Mr. Quayle the "attack bird of the Bush campaign," Mrs. Schroeder riposted, "Imagine Neil Bush as Secretary of the Treasury for the next four years." Neil Bush, the President's son, has been embroiled in the savings-and-loan scandal.
Mr. Tribe said: "I certainly didn't expect to be part of Dan Quayle's utopia. And if I'm to be part of anyone's nightmare, Dan Quayle would be a reasonable choice."
Apart from supporting Mr. Bush, the Vice President's appearance was a chance to push himself in the struggle for leadership of conservatives.
In this election, Mr. Quayle declared, "we will lay the groundwork for our next great triumph: a fifth straight conservative victory in the year 1996."

HEADLINE: U.S. Lifts Its Sanctions on China Over High-Technology Transfers

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 21

 BODY:
The Bush Administration lifted sanctions against China's transfer of high technology today after accepting its promise to abide by restrictions on the sale of missiles and missile technology to the Middle East.
The decision was pushed by the White House and the State Department despite recent intelligence reports that China is continuing to sell missile technology to Syria, Iran and Pakistan and nuclear technology to Iran, according to some senior Administration officials and lawmakers. 
 Lifting the sanctions, which prevented the sale of American satellite parts and high-speed computers to China, is important because it removes the obstacle to China's signing of the Missile Technology Control Regime, a 1987 international agreement restricting the export of missiles and missile technology. In November, Beijing promised Secretary of State James A. Baker that it would adhere to the agreement if Washington lifted the sanctions.
The decision also reflects Mr. Bush's firm belief that the way to moderate China's behavior is through contact and trust as well as the Administration's willingness to give the country the benefit of the doubt on the missile issue.
Despite the announcement, there is division within the Administration and among lawmakers about China's intentions and the wisdom of lifting the sanctions.
In explaining the reasons, Lawrence S. Eagleburger, the Deputy Secretary of State, and other Administration officials argued that adherence to the missile control regime was an important gesture and could signify the first step toward achieving similar concessions in other contentious areas, like the transfer of nuclear technology and intellectual property rights.
But these officials stopped short of stating categorically that China had ceased the sale or delivery of missile technology that would violate the missile control regime. Instead, one official explained, they said only that the Administration "has thus far not determined that the Chinese have engaged in activities that would bring about sanctions." They also argue that there is no evidence to support the claim that China shipped technology after the pledge made to Mr. Baker.
Other Government analysts cite intelligence reports indicating that Chinese exports continue, including, for example, the recent shipments of chemicals needed to make missiles to Syria and Iran. They also say they believe that China has accelerated the delivery of some nuclear technology to Iran in anticipation of signing the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. China has said it favored signing the treaty, but has not yet done so.
 
A Letter From China
 The Bush Administration has made the issue of nonproliferation the linchpin of its post-cold-war foreign policy, and is especially eager to halt the transfer of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and ballistic missiles to the developing world.
Today's decision follows a letter three weeks ago from Foreign Minister Qian Qichen of China formally agreeing to abide by the guidelines of the Missile Technology Control Regime, Margaret D. Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, said in a statement today.
"China's written commitment to abide by M.T.C.R. guidelines and parameters is an important step forward in securing Chinese support for ballistic missile nonproliferation," Miss Tutwiler said.
In recent days, Mr. Eagleburger has met with a number of Republican Senators, both to inform them that the Administration was lifting the sanctions as well as to urge them to renew most-favored-nation trade status for China when the current certification expires in June. The trade privileges allow China's goods to enter the market at the lowest tariff rates.
 
Closed-Door Session Urged
 On Thursday, some Senators briefed by intelligence analysts came away convinced that sales were continuing and concerned about the scope of the pending Chinese contracts that are believed to involve billions of dollars and extend over several years.
The Senate vote on the trade status is set for Tuesday, but many are urging the Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell, Democrat of Maine to hold a rare closed-door session to discuss the recent intelligence findings.
 
No Response
 In criticizing the lifting of the sanctions, Senator Mitchell said in a statement today: "The Chinese leaders have again failed to keep their word, but President Bush has once again placated their demands without any tangible substantive evidence in their policy of repression and deceit.
"In doing so, he has continued his failed policy regarding China, and has increased the threat to peace," he said.
Early this month, a bipartisan group of 17 Senators sent a classified letter to Mr. Baker complaining about recent arms sales by China to the Middle East. The letter, signed by Senator Mitchell and leading members of the Senate Foreign Relations, Armed Services and Intelligence Committees, was an effort to prevent the Administration from going forward with the agreement made by Mr. Baker in November. No response has been received, Senate staff members said.
The Administration had delayed lifting the sanctions pending China's clarification of several issues, including its agreement not to deliver missiles and technology that were contracted for before its pledge to Mr. Baker.
The sanctions, which are unrelated to those imposed after the military crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing in 1989, were imposed last June after American officials discovered that China had sent launchers for its newly developed M-11 missiles to Pakistan.
When the sanctions were announced, the Commerce Department had 20 pending license applications to allow the sale to China of about $30 million worth of high-speed computers, Administration officials said.
A number of senators are also upset that the Bush Administration has not fulfilled its obligation under last year's State Department Authorization Bill to submit a report by Jan. 26 detailing China's arms transfer practices.
 
Report 'Stuck,' Some Say
 Senator Joseph R. Biden, the Delaware Democrat, said in a statement today that what "angers" him is that the report has been delayed. "I have been told by the Administration that this report is 'stuck in the State Deparmtent,' " he said. "What I suspect that means is that the report contains information confirming that the Chinese have not changed their ways and are already breaking their promises to the Bush Administration, promises that led to the lifting of sanctions on Friday."
The State Department denied that the report was "stuck," but could give no explanation for the delay.
According to some Administration officials, China has complained that the Administration is demanding too many restrictions on the sale of arms-related technology. Although there is a detailed annex to the Missile Technology Control Regime, which lists the forbidden materials and equipment, there is some disagreement within the Administration on what constitutes a violation.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Poll;
Tsongas Gains Substantially, Pulling Near Clinton in Poll

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr.

 BODY:
Former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts made a substantial gain in national recognition as a result of his victory in the New Hampshire primary and has drawn close to Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas among Democrats who have chosen a favorite for their party's nomination, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll.
But all five main Democratic candidates remain virtually unknown to half or more of the likely primary voters in their own party, the poll found. 
 Mr. Clinton has the support of 29 percent of his party's likely voters, despite increased negative views about him that were detected in the poll, which was conducted Wednesday and Thursday. Mr. Tsongas is second with 24 percent and has made the greater gain of the two since the last Times/ CBS News poll, in January. He moved up 14 percentage points while Mr. Clinton advanced by 7 points. Because of the new poll's margin of sampling error, Mr. Tsongas and Mr. Clinton could now be in a virtual tie.
 
Bush Leads His Challenger
 Former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California was backed by 10 percent in the new poll, Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska by 4 percent and Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa by 3 percent.
Among Republican primary voters nationally, President Bush leads his conservative challenger, Patrick J. Buchanan, by a 4-to-1 ratio, the survey showed. And while 80 percent of Republican primary voters agree that Mr. Buchanan is "saying some things George Bush needs to hear," 73 percent of those same voters say they want Mr. Bush to win his party's nomination.
But among all registered voters in the nation, regardless of party, 53 percent say they lack any clear idea of what Mr. Bush "wants to accomplish in a second term as President," even though he has been campaigning for re-election for at least six weeks.
This finding coincides with the judgment of Republican strategists who have criticized the President's "I care" message in the New Hampshire primary campaign. With 13 primaries scheduled for the next three weeks and Mr. Buchanan pressing his campaign, it also suggests that the White House needs to retool its strategy quickly.
It had been theorized by many politicians that neither of the top finishers in the Democratic voting in New Hampshire, Mr. Tsongas and Mr. Clinton, would get much benefit nationally from their accomplishment because so much attention was focused on Mr. Buchanan's strong showing against the President. But the Times/CBS News poll showed they have become much the best-known of active Democratic candidates.
The current survey, which has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points, suggests that the President retains ample room to change voters' minds and retake the initiative, and, like all incumbents, he has many tools with which to do so.
 
Trouble on Economic Front
 Still, the poll indicates that Mr. Bush has national difficulties, not just a local problem brought on by New Hampshire's severe recession. His approval rating is hovering at 42 percent, about the same as it was just before the State of the Union Message on Jan. 28, which had been widely heralded as the key to turning around the economy and halting the President's slide.
Clearly, the speech did not accomplish its political purpose, and polls indicate there was not even a brief lift for Mr. Bush.
The Times/CBS News poll showed only 18 percent approval of Mr. Bush's handling of the economy, the worst level for a President since Jimmy Carter, who was at 15 percent in July 1979. In the current survey of 1,044 adults, 75 percent said they disapproved of Mr. Bush's economic stewardship.
Hard economic times and a belief that the Bush Administration is responsible for them are evidently hurting the President, despite his effort in his speeches and his primary-state advertising to lay much of the blame on the Democratic-controlled Congress.
Asked whether Mr. Bush "cares about the needs and problems" of people like themselves, only 49 percent of registered voters said yes, a dangerous level for an incumbent who has had three years to connect with the electorate and especially dangerous for one who has been saying "I care" again and again. More directly, 46 percent said they placed "a lot of the blame" for the recession on the White House.
On another question in the same area, 52 percent of all those interviewed and 37 percent of Republicans, a significant minority, said Mr. Bush could have avoided raising taxes in 1990. It was the President's violation of his "no new taxes" pledge that Mr. Buchanan hammered home in New Hampshire television commercials.
Not suprisingly, given his blunt style of speaking and writing, Mr. Buchanan evokes contrasting reactions among Republicans. Of primary voters, 24 percent hold a favorable view and 26 percent an unfavorable view of the television commentator, columnist and former White House speech writer.
Nevertheless, 44 percent said Mr. Buchanan, who has never held elective office, "has the ability to be an effective President," while 34 percent disagreed with that.
Republican primary voters preferred Mr. Bush as the party's nominee, with 73 percent backing him, 17 percent supporting Mr. Buchanan, and 2 percent choosing David Duke of Louisiana, a former Ku Klux Klan leader.
 
Bush Leads Democratic Rivals
 The Democratic electorate has reached no consensus about a preferred challenger to Mr. Bush, at least partly because the party's candidates remain poorly defined in the public mind. Exactly half the Democratic primary voters questioned in the survey expressed no opinion about Mr. Clinton, despite torrents of publicity about accusations of marital infidelity and of efforts of avoid the draft during the Vietnam War. Even fewer had an opinion about the other candidates.
As a result, perhaps, Mr. Bush lost a trial heat against an unnamed and possibly idealized Democratic nominee, 40 percent to 45 percent, but he won theoretical races among registered voters: against Mr. Clinton by 51 to 40, against Mr. Tsongas by 47 to 40 and against Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, often mentioned as a possible late starter in the race, by 52 to 33.
Both Mr. Tsongas and Mr. Clinton are rated favorably by 33 percent of Democratic primary voters nationally, but Mr. Tsongas is rated unfavorably by only 9 percent, while Mr. Clinton is so characterized by 16 percent. That could be the result of the accusations against Mr. Clinton this month.
Though relatively unknown, the Democratic hopefuls are apparently gradually persuading voters that they constitute a reasonable pool of talent. Last October, 64 percent of Democratic voters said they wished there were more choices, but this week only 45 percent said additional candidates were needed, while another 45 percent said they were satisfied with the field.
Among three potential late starters whose support was explicitly gauged in the poll, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, on whose behalf a write-in campaign was waged in New Hampshire, is the most popular. He is followed by Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, the 1988 Vice Presidential nominee, and Mr. Gephardt.
Voters in New Hampshire repeatedly emphasized to reporters this year that "the issues" were what mattered most to them, and the 820 registered voters among those interviewed in the Times/CBS News poll said the same thing. Seventy-two percent said issues would play the largest role in their decision on how to vote; the next most frequently mentioned criterion, a candidate's moral character, was ranked first by only 5 percent.
But other answers suggested deeper currents. Asked whether the accusation about Mr. Clinton's marital life would affect their votes, 61 percent said no. But when asked whether the accusation would affect how other voters would react, only 28 percent said they thought the accusation would be seen as immaterial.
 
 
 
HOW THE POLL WAS CONDUCTED
 The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted on Wednesday and Thursday with 1,044 adults, including 820 registered voters, around the United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the continental United States. The exchanges were chosen to insure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. The numbers were then screened so that calls would be placed to residences only. Within each household one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent to the poll.
The results have been weighted to take account of a household's size and the number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to region, race, sex, age and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
The potential sampling error for smaller subgroups is larger. For example, for those who say they vote in Democratic primaries or caucuses, it is plus or minus five percentage points. For Republican primary and caucus voters, it is six percentage points.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll.

HEADLINE: Closing the Books in Hartford

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Feb. 21

 BODY:
It was perhaps inevitable, after 25 years in side-by-side offices poring over the same documents, that Leo V. Donohue and Henry J. Becker Jr. should start completing each other's sentences.
Mr. Becker: "I guess we knew each other ----" 
 Mr. Donohue: "Since about 19 ----"
In unison: "55."
Mr. Becker: "Yeah."
Their jobs, as Connecticut's co-auditors of public accounts, are unusual enough.
No other state takes a Democrat, in this case Mr. Donohue, and a Republican, Mr. Becker, and expects them to work in harmony, signing off as co-equals on what are sometimes politically charged audits of state agency spending and performance. That such joined-at-the-hip public accounting has worked since 1967 without the two having killed each other has made them something of a State Capitol legend.
They live in the same small town of Avon, a suburb of Hartford. Their children played on the same Avon High School football team. They took office on the same day two-and-half decades ago, during the administration of Gov. John Dempsey, and next Friday they will retire as they served: together. Yet they profess not to be particularly close friends, and are bit uncertain about when and if they'll even run into each other again. Perhaps the supermarket, they say.
Yet they leave an unmistakable if somewhat mysterious legacy. Because hardly anyone is left in government who even remembers previous auditors, Mr. Becker, who is 63 years old, and Mr. Donohue, 67, have defined their jobs in a way that few people ever get to, or want to. And the decades have hardened personal idiosyncrasies into institutional ones.
 
A Rougher Era
 They made a pact in the early days, for example, that an employment reference from a politician would be "the kiss of death" to anyone seeking a job on the 96-member auditing staff because, as Mr. Donohue put it, "We don't want to hire anyone to the office who feels more loyal to one of us than the other."
Officials at the National Association of State Auditors, Comptrollers and Treasurers also said that Connecticut is the only state in the nation that has adamantly refused to join the group to share information and auditing techniques.
"One being a Democrat, one being a Republican, maybe one of them couldn't ever leave Connecticut without fear of the other getting the upper hand," said Relmond Van Daniker, the 49-member association's executive director. "It's a very unusual situation."
Even how a new auditor is appointed is something that has had to relearned. "When we were putting in our notice to leave, from both sides we got questions like, 'Well, do we make the appointment?' " Mr. Becker said in a joint interview.
Many politicians are also beginning to realize that the new auditors will have to begin a new era of their own. Mr. Becker and Mr. Donohue, who served under 12 different governors in various state jobs since the 1940's, came of age and into office in a time of simpler, smaller government and more gentlemanly rules of political conduct.
"They came from a fair-minded era," said Thomas I. D'Amore Jr., a veteran of Connecticut state politics since the 1970's, most recently as co-chief of staff under under Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. "It was more balanced, less combative," Mr. D'Amore said. "It was O.K. to stand up and defend your position, but you didn't have to win every battle. Now it's win at all costs, do or die today."
The thought of a daily battle with the person in the next office has clearly given some people pause. But Mr. Becker said he told one worried applicant for the $74,000-a-year job that for a Democrat and a Republican, getting along now should be easier than ever, with a third-party independent Governor like Mr. Weicker in office.
"You've got a Governor up there that neither one of you can be very happy with," he said. "That alone should bring you together."
The statute that defines the auditors' jobs doesn't give much how-to-survive guidance, saying only that the auditors, once appointed by the General Assembly, shall "organize the work of their office in such a manner as they deem most economical and efficient." That could mean, theoretically, majority and dissenting reports, or audits within audits, as the minority party auditor checks the work of the majority.
 
Unique System
 For Mr. Becker and Mr. Donohue, the pressures appear to have driven them almost into a singular perspective. Their work -- all reports signed by both men -- is praised by party leaders on both sides as non-partisan. And on those occasions when one or the other party has been offended by a report, the two men have stood shoulder-to-shoulder against all comers.
Mr. Van Daniker at the Auditors Association said that while states vary widely in how they approach the job of auditing their own books, no other state has the sort of institutional duality featured here. New York is probably "the next most unique," he said, in having one man, Edward V. Regan, whose job as Comptroller also includes auditing duties -- thus the office that keeps the books also checks them.
The co-auditor system began in colonial times, Mr. Becker and Mr. Donohue said, and it is a system they swear by, however much their colleagues around the country scratch their heads.
"We both think that it is a lot better system than it appears," Mr. Donohue said. "When you have two people here, not of the same party, it's impossible for either to cover something up, or to overstress something, because you know that the person in the next office knows as much about the issue as you do. Nothing keeps you more honest than the threat of being caught."

HEADLINE: City Job Loss Called More Than Expected

 BODY:
New York City lost about 50,000 more jobs in 1991 than had been thought, according to revised statistics published yesterday by the New York State Department of Labor.
Previously, the city's job losses last year had been estimated at 160,000 jobs, but that figure has now been raised to 210,000, coming off a total non-agricultural employment base of 3.5 million. 
 About half of the additional 50,000 jobs that were lost came from the services sector, and the greatest losses in that sector were 9,000 in the business services category and 7,000 in engineering and management.
" That's a fairly substantial revision," acknowledged Jim Brown, a labor market analyst for the department. "It suggests that the city's economy has not yet bottomed out."
Mr. Brown said that the revision had occurred because the estimates are based on monthly samples, and the sample for the services group is especially small. Only when quarterly data depicting the actual number of employees come in can the department tell whether its sample figures need to be revised.

HEADLINE: Middle Class Shrinks, U.S. Says

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 21

 BODY:
The Government has provided new evidence that the American middle class is shrinking.
A report released by the Census Bureau on Thursday shows that the percentage of Americans with middle incomes dropped from 71.2 percent in 1969 to 63.3 percent in 1989. 
 "The conclusion is obviously that inequality has grown rather substantially over the last 20 years," said Jack McNeil, the Census Bureau economist who wrote the report. "We're getting clusters toward both ends" of the income scale, he said.
The growing income inequality is partly due to the increase in the number of families headed by single mothers, who are less likely to work, Mr. McNeil said.
Several studies in recent years have documented the decline of the middle class, but the new report provides more detail on income trends in different population groups, Mr. McNeil said. For the first time, the Census Bureau used a measure of income that takes family size into account.
"The elderly are doing better than any other group," Mr. McNeil said. "You can see some improvement in their relative status."
The percentage of people 65 years old and over with middle incomes ranged from 21.5 percent to 29.9 percent in 1964, the report said. By 1989 the range had grown to 24.9 percent to 34.2 percent.
The study defined low incomes as less than half the median income, when adjusted for family size. High incomes were defined as more than twice the median.
By these definitions, a family of four has a low income if it makes below $18,576 a year. By contrast, the census defines a family of four as poor if its annual income is less than $13,359. The report showed that the percentage of Americans with low incomes rose to 22.1 percent in 1989 from 17.9 percent in 1969.

HEADLINE: U.S. Refuses To Supervise Newark Job

BYLINE: By EVELYN NIEVES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWARK, Feb. 21

 BODY:
Saying that they are satisfied with steps to improve the Newark Housing Authority, Federal housing officials have refused to appoint a receiver to manage the agency's long-delayed construction projects.
Burton Bloomberg, the acting manager of the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development in Newark, said he was denying the receiver because he was satisfied that Newark, state and Federal officials were taking steps to speed up housing construction -- including naming a task force to help reduce bureaucratic delays and developing a $60 million revolving loan fund to help developers who had been unable to obtain financing during the recession. 
 "At this critical juncture, when the emerging signs of cooperative effort and marshalling of technical resources needed to further development are so encouraging, it is H.U.D.'s judgment that appointment of a receiver would be unwarranted and could impede progress," Mr. Bloomberg said in a statement released Tuesday.
But Victor DeLuca, chairman of the Newark Coalition for Low-Income Housing, which had requested the receiver in December, said that Federal housing officials did not address the myriad problems plaguing New Jersey's largest housing authority in arriving at its decision.
 
List of Delays and Missteps
 "We believe that the problems with the Newark Housing Authority are ones of capacity, of experience," he said, adding that the coalition may sue to force H.U.D. to name an overseer. "A new initiative to speed up construction isn't going to address their problems in implementing the process."
The Federal housing agency has appointed receivers to manage other troubled housing authorities or their programs, including those of Passaic, N.J., East St. Louis, Ill., and Chicago.
The coalition had requested the receiver in an application that chronicled a long list of delays and missteps in the authority's construction program dating to 1978.
Newark's public housing authority, by H.U.D.'s own measure, is considered among the most troubled in the country, with a long history of failing to maintain or build housing even when it had money to do both.
The coalition, which was formed by community and housing advocates in response to the Newark authority's plans to demolish 39 of its 46 high-rise buildings, sued H.U.D. and the housing authority in 1989 to block the planned demolitions.
 
No New Housing Since 1989
 The groups reached a settlement in September 1989 that guaranteed replacements for 1,777 units of housing that the authority plans to raze. Eleven buildings will eventually be leveled once construction of replacements begins.
Since the settlement, no new housing has been built. One partly built project blew down in a windstorm.
Mayor Sharpe James, who named the task force, has blamed the former housing director, Dr. Daniel Blue Jr., for the authority's failures. The director's contract expired on Dec. 31 and he has since joined the Chicago Housing Authority. Five top administrators resigned in December as well.
Mr. Bloomberg said that the Newark Housing Authority was to locate three candidates for the top position by March 1, with a selection to be made shortly afterward, and that efforts were under way to fill the other top positions.
"H.U.D. is satisfied that the N.H.A., with Mayor James's support, is moving forward decisively to resolve its personnel problems," he said.
But Mr. DeLuca said that a new executive director would be faced with an agency in turmoil.
"We have a lot of hopes that a new executive director will turn things around," he said. "We would applaud that. But construction isn't the agency's only problem. There is personnel, management of the housing. Unless you hire a super-person, the executive director can't do it all."

HEADLINE: U.N. Votes to Send Force to Yugoslavia

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 21

 BODY:
The United Nations Security Council voted unanimously tonight to start dispatching a 14,000-member peacekeeping force to Yugoslavia to monitor the cease-fire there and protect minority Serbs in Croatia until their future is settled.
The operation in Yugoslavia, which is already one of the biggest the United Nations has ever organized, will be followed by an even bigger and more complex one next week when the Council is expected to send military and civilian contingents to oversee the end of Cambodia's long civil war, disarm its rival factions, return refugees and organize nationwide free elections. 
 Initial estimates put the cost of those two missions at more than $3 billion, or more than four times the $700 million United Nations members were asked to pay for peacekeeping costs last year at a time when the organization is already owed nearly $1 billion by its membership in unpaid dues.
 
Deployment in Stages
 Agreement to send the force to Yugoslavia came after compromises were struck within the 15-member Council in disputes over its peacekeeping powers as well as over the operation's $634 million annual cost, which the United States and other Western members say is excessive.
As a result only part of the force will be deployed at first, while the United Nations Secretary General asks the parties to the fighting to contribute more toward the cost of the operation.
Under the United Nations peace plan, the 14,000 peacekeepers will be charged with insuring the security of about 14 Serbian minority enclaves in the breakaway republic of Croatia for at least a year until an overall political agreement is reached on the future of the Yugoslav federation.
But the United States, with support from other Western members, wanted to insure that the Croatian government of Franjo Tudjman, which has criticized aspects of the peace plan, had no possible legal basis for seeking the force's withdrawal before such an agreement is reached.
 
Fear Among Serbs
 As a result, it proposed deploying the force under the provisions of chapter seven of the United Nations Charter, which allows the Council to issue mandatory orders and enforce them by economic blockades or even military force.
As other countries recognize Croatia and the Tudjman government grows more self-confident, the Serbian minority fears Zagreb may try to remove the United Nations soldiers, leaving its members at the mercy of the Croatian majority and in danger of being driven over the border into Serbia.
But the Security Council's third-world members, lead by India, objected to invoking chapter seven, saying that would set a precedent by imposing a peacekeeping force on Croatia without its consent, thus expanding the Council's authority.
The third-world countries are fighting any move that enlarges the powers of the Security Council, which they increasingly see as an instrument of American foreign policy.
The final compromise drops all mention of chapter seven from the resolution's text. Instead the United States Representative, as this month's president, sought to add a statement to the resolution saying that Article 25 of the Charter "will apply to the decisions the Council will be taking in this resolution." Under Article 25, all United Nations members agree "to accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council."
The United States, France, Britain, Russia and China, which as permanent Council members pay more than half the cost of peacekeeping operations, have also agreed to ask Yugoslavia to contribute more toward the costs of the peacekeeping force to reduce the bill they will face.
In particular, many countries want Yugoslavia to provide local barracks for the soldiers, thus saving the $110 million that the United Nations Secretariat has proposed for buying prefabrictaed housing for the peacekeeping force.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Maine;
A New England Contest That Is Hard to Predict

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Me., Feb. 21

 BODY:
When it comes to the spring Presidential caucuses and primaries, a case can be made that as New Hampshire goes, so goes Maine.
That at least has been the political way of things in recent election years, particularly on the Democratic side. But when Democrats and Republicans caucus all across Maine on Sunday to express their Presidential nominating preferences for 1992, the results seem at this point to be anything but inevitable, especially on the Democratic side. 
 In other words, there is no guarantee for former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, who won the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday, that Maine will also make their fellow New Englander a winner.
Not only do Maine voters leave the impression that they are in an unpredictable and irascible mood, like voters everywhere, but the caucus process itself also adds to the uncertainty. Candidates can pack the caucuses with their supporters, bringing results that may not reflect the true feelings of the general electorate.
 
Organization's the Thing
 Although the candidates are spending less time here than in other, more delegate-rich states, their aides are aggressively lining up backers. The outcome may well depend more on organization than message, money or media, which was not the case in New Hampshire.
"I wouldn't bet a penny on anything; not this year," said Jo Karr, the chairwoman of Maine's Democratic Party. "You can't control it. You can't buy it with television. You can't predict it. You can't rely on what's happened in the past, on what they did over in New Hampshire -- certainly not this year, not the way people are feeling."
Every campaign organization is mostly working phones and sending out letters. Very few campaign advertisements are showing up on television or in newspapers. And because the candidates themselves are mostly elsewhere, there is little campaign news on the air or on the front page.
"A caucus state is a little like a duck on water," Ms. Karr said. "It's hard to tell how much paddling is going on."
 
Bush Victory Is Expected
 Political professionals say President Bush, who has a summer home down the coast in Kennebunkport and is regarded by many people in Maine as one of them, will win the Republican contest easily.
But given the weakness he showed in New Hampshire, the experts wonder whether a significant number of Maine Republicans might opt to send a message of discontent by voting for "uncommitted" in their caucuses.
And the political professionals wonder whether Mr. Bush's Republican challenger, Patrick J. Buchanan, who has no visible campaign organization in the state, might nevertheless embarrass the President anew by attracting some insurgent support.
"Nobody expects the President to show badly," said Edward O'Meara, the chairman of Maine's Republican Party. "There's no real evidence of any Buchanan organization out there, not even a phone number. But you never know for sure."
On the Democratic side, the outcome of the caucus is anybody's guess.
At first glance, Mr. Tsongas seems almost certain to get a big boost from his victory in neighboring New Hampshire and from the fact that he comes from Massachusetts. If he does not he will be seriously weakened.
"Give us that second booster shot," Mr. Tsongas told voters on Thursday night when he showed up briefly in the state for a rally in Bangor.
While Mr. Tsongas would seem to have a regional advantage in Maine, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas is believed to have the best organization in the state, with four offices and eight paid campaign workers. And Mr. Clinton has decided to break away from campaigning in the South on Saturday for a pre-caucus supper in Lewiston.
"This is retail politics," said David Leavy, Mr. Clinton's field director. "You can't do it from afar. You have to get out and meet the people."
 
Brown Is Running Hard
 Adding to the uncertainty of the Democratic contest, former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California has been working the state hard, committing himself to five consecutive days of campaigning here this week.
He did better in New Hampshire than most political experts had expected, winning 8 percent of the vote after polls showed him with about half that much. He and a number of experts here believe that his anti-establishment message may resonate well in Maine.
As for the other Democrats in the race, Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa has visited Maine several times, though not this week. There is little expectation that he will finish near the top in the caucuses, but no one is writing him off; his unabashed liberalism has captured the support of much of the state's labor establishment.
Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska paid a quick visit to Maine on Wednesday, saying he had come "to let you know I'm by no means out of this race." But his organizers say his expectations here are low.

HEADLINE: Health Insurance for Nannies Urged as a Family Obligation

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE

 BODY:
Health insurance for domestic help is an idea whose time has come, according to employment agencies and insurance experts.
And most families that employ nannies, baby sitters, housekeepers or other household workers are usually aware that they may have to withhold from their employee's pay checks funds for Social Security, Medicare and various income taxes. 
 Health insurance is not required by law, but in an age of increasing medical costs, it is a benefit employers should think about if they are close to those who take care of their children, their elderly parents or their homes. Experts say it should be discussedwith any valued household employee.
 
It Makes Sense, Some Say
 The cost can either be deducted from pay, with the employee's permission, or paid by the employer at no cost to the worker.
Some employment agencies and insurers consider it a moral obligation just as compelling as paying taxes. They say it makes sense because some employers pay part or all of medical costs their employees cannot afford . Only about 2 percent of the full-time nannies in the United States are believed to have health insurance, according to M. Lynn Larsen, president of Pacific Benefits, a Salt Lake City insurance brokerage.
"Most nannies are permanent workers who have to use important personal judgment, so everything about it suggests that health insurance should be an incidence of their employment," said Carl Schramm, president of the Health Insurance Association of America. "A lot of people don't know that there are specifically formulated groups that make insurance available to nannies."
Nedra Kleinman, owner of the All-Home Services Agency, an employment agency for household workers in New York City, said, "If you want to attract good people to care for your children, health insurance is a way to help do it."
Among a dozen companies that offer special health insurance to domestic employees are the Home Life Insurance Company, the Acceleration Life Insurance Company and the Time Insurance Company. Some offer a group rate to applicants that is usually lower than individual rates. "In any case, you have to answer health questions," said Gordon M. Silverstein, president of the Triad Insurance Group, a Los Angeles insurance brokerage, "and you want to make sure of the rating of the company you're dealing with."
Mr. Silverstein, whose company handles the medical insurance of the International Nanny Association, a nonprofit advocacy organization for child-care providers who work in the home, said a typical policy would include a $300 deductible. Among factors governing that policy's premium are age, sex and geography. Someone in Los Angeles might pay about $150 a month, while someone in Memphis, where medical costs are lower, might pay $60 a month. Someone over 30 would pay more than someone under 30.
Other benefit programs are sold to household employers and employees. Pacific Benefits provides a pension plan for nannies through its subsidiary, Child Care Staffing. If employee and employer agree, the worker becomes an employee of Child Care, which leases the nanny to the employer. The employer is billed monthly for the salary, tax payments, health insurance and other agreed-upon benefits. The employee pays nothing for this service, but the employer pays $35 to $40 a month to Child Care.
"It's not for everyone," said Mr. Larsen of Pacific Benefits. "But there is a growing segment of employers and nannies who want taxes done correctly and who want some of the benefits offered to employees of regular companies."
Paul Rifkin, president of Domestically Yours, a household employment agency in New York City, said health insurance was a valuable perquisite for domestic workers. "My recommendation is that, after three months, the employer should offer it to the person, instead of giving her a raise," Mr. Rifkin said. "It shows her that she is working for nice people."
 
 
 
DON'T FORGET THESE DEDUCTIONS
 The most common required deductions from a household worker's pay are for Social Security and the Medicare tax, under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, or FICA.
The law calls for deductions whenever a worker earns $50 or more in a quarter of a year, excluding the value of room and board but including money paid for transportation. Employees and employers each must pay 7.65 percent of a worker's pay up to $55,000, plus 1.45 percent each on wages between $55,000 and $130,200.
Of course, an employer can also voluntarily pay the employee's share, for a total of 15.3 percent of annual wages -- although this is additional income and is taxable. Payment is made quarterly to the Internal Revenue Service on Form 942.
Withholding Federal income tax from a paycheck is not required for services performed in or about a private home unless the employee asks for it and the employer agrees. But the employee remains responsible for paying a tax on earnings even when nothing is withheld.
Finally, employers must pay a Federal unemployment tax, for domestic service workers who earn at least $1,000 in a quarter year. The tax rate this year is 6.2 percent of the first $7,000 earned, with this tax reported on Form 940 or the simpler Form 940-EZ.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: White House;
Bush Hits All Targets Except His Challenger

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHARLESTON, S.C., Feb. 21

 BODY:
President Bush inveighed today against tax increases, socialized medicine, ambulance-chasing lawyers, the welfare system, Congress and big government. But he barely gave a rhetorical nod to his most nettlesome problem, ensconced in a hotel meeting room a block away.
In a speech to the Southern Republican Leadership Conference here, Mr. Bush all but ignored Patrick J. Buchanan, the rebellious opponent who cast a shadow over the President's primary-election debut this week. 
 Mr. Buchanan held a news conference at a nearby hotel minutes before Mr. Bush spoke, accusing the President of shutting him out of the Republican meeting and of dodging his call for a debate.
 
Upbeat Themes
 But Mr. Bush, sticking to the advice of his strategists, did not mention his foe by name and made only oblique stabs at Mr. Buchanan's bitter criticism of his policies. Those attacks drew blood in New Hampshire, where Mr. Buchanan gained 37 percent of the Republican vote.
So far, Mr. Bush's advisers seem content to ignore Mr. Buchanan in the South, where they believe better economic conditions make voters less inclined to cast a protest ballot against the White House.
Mr. Bush stuck today to the same upbeat campaign themes he has been sounding with limited success since the early fall, including his leadership of the assault on Iraq and his efforts to maintain America's leadership role in the world.
By comparison, he said, other unnamed opponents "just wish the world would go away" and have only pessimistic predictions about the future of the United States.
"Let's not listen to the gloom and doom from all those intense talking heads who are happy only when they say something negative," Mr. Bush said, apparently referring to Mr. Buchanan's career as a television commentator. He added, "We are the United States of America, and we don't have to put up with all that."
 
A Veto Is Promised
 The only new element in Mr. Bush's speech today was a pledge to veto the economic-relief package that Democrats in Congress are assembling if it includes any increase in the personal income tax.
The latest version includes a tax cut for middle-income taxpayers and a cut in the capital gains tax, to be financed in part by a surtax on million-dollar incomes and an increase from 31 percent to 35 percent for individuals with taxable incomes above $85,000 and for families with taxable incomes above $145,000.
The President's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, had refused to promise outright that Mr. Bush would veto a tax increase. In New Hampshire, Mr. Buchanan scored points by casting Mr. Bush as someone who had abandoned his 1988 pledge not to raise taxes and who could not be trusted not to do the same thing again.
But today Mr. Bush invoked more of the Persian Gulf war oratory that he used in his State of the Union speech last month, saying he is drawing "a line in the sand" on tax increases.
"I will veto it the minute it hits my desk," he said.
Mr. Bush drew repeated cheers from the largely adoring crowd of Republicans, some waving Bush campaign signs.
Earlier, Mr. Buchanan told reporters that Mr. Bush's new veto pledge was "the right thing." But he added, "I only wish he'd done that in 1990, and some of us would not be here today."
Mr. Buchanan attacked Mr. Bush's foreign policies, saying they would "diminish American sovereignty" by making Washington subordinate to the United Nations, and claiming that Mr. Bush's rhetoric on family values, taxes and other pressing issues did not match his commitment.
He also accused Mr. Bush, who has refused to debate him, of dodging a chance to defend his policies.
Mr. Buchanan said the state's Republican Governor, Carroll A. Campbell Jr., had laid what he called "the South Carolina trap" for him, hoping Mr. Buchanan would build up expectations of a good showing before suffering a lethal blow in the state's March 7 primary.
The South Carolina primary is on the Saturday between the March 3 primaries in Georgia and Maryland and the Super Tuesday primaries on March 10.
 
A Strong Bush State
 Mr. Buchanan conceded that South Carolina is a strong Bush state, but said he still hoped to surprise the President here.
Mr. Bush's aides said that the President planned to continue to refrain from personal assaults on Mr. Buchanan, but to talk in more general terms about his policies instead.
In Georgia, one of Mr. Bush's top campaign operatives said on Thursday that Bush strategists want to measure the depth of support for Mr. Buchanan before deciding whether to unleash negative commercials and personal attacks on their foe.
"I don't think they're sure what they want to do," the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said of the Bush campaign's approach to Mr. Buchanan. "We're being told to handle him with basically kid gloves. The word is, don't say anything in any sense that would anger Buchanan supporters, because we'll need them in the fall."
Today's trip to Charleston marked the start of two weeks of almost constant travel that will carry Mr. Bush on largely political missions across the South and West.
After a weekend at Camp David, the President plans to open his Maryland campaign in a Washington suburb on Monday. On Tuesday he leaves on a six-day trip to political events in California, political speeches and a drug-control summit in Texas, and more politicking in Georgia.
Mr. Bush will spend much of the following week in other Southern states, preparing for primaries that are to be held on March 3 and March 10.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Israel Still Fail To Resolve Loan Issues

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 21

 BODY:
Israeli and United States officials tried again today to resolve their differences over American demands that Israel halt building new settlements in the occupied territories as a condition for American loan guarantees, but the two sides did not make any progress.
Israel's Ambassador to Washington, Zalman Shoval, met with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d in their third negotiating session on the issue, but both sides said afterward that they were holding to their basic positions. 
 Leaving the State Department, Mr. Shoval said: "There is no agreement yet. We will have another talk." He declined to answer further questions.
The Israeli Ambassador, while signaling that Israel might be ready to slow down new settlement building, said Israel could not accept a total halt. But that is what Mr. Baker is demanding, officials said.
 
Talks Held in Private
 The talks between Mr. Baker and Mr. Shoval have been conducted solely between the two men with no aides present. Mr. Baker has formulated the Administration's position on the issue almost exclusively in consultation with President Bush, without the usual Middle East policy advisers.
The Administration's position is that it will support, in principle, Israel's request for the loan guarantees to help cover the cost of absorbing the influx of immigrants from the former Soviet Union, including housing for them, on three conditions. First, Israel would be allowed to complete only those housing units in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip that are already under construction. The Administration estimates that number to be around 6,000. The Israelis estimate that number at over 13,000.
Second, Israel would have to accept a halt on any new housing starts in the occupied territories. Third, the United States would deduct from the loan guarantees one dollar for every dollar Israel spends in the West Bank and Gaza to complete those housing units already under way. This would be to insure that United States funds do not contribute, directly or indirectly, to building settlements in the occupied territories.
The Israeli position is that it should be allowed to complete those settlements already under way, as well as start a limited number of new housing units each year.
 
Seek $10 Billion
 Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir is seeking $10 billion in loan guarantees spread over five years. It is possible that if the Administration does not come around, Mr. Shamir may opt instead for a one-year deal, officials say. The political advantage of this is that the Israeli Prime Minister could tell voters at home that since Israel is being permitted to complete the several thousand housing units already under construciton, it is not be accepting any freeze, and at the same time he could tell the Bush Administration that he was not going to start any new units, thereby effectively accepting a freeze.
The loan guarantees allow Israel to borrow money on commercial capital markets at lower interest rates. The Israelis, though, have to pay all the money back themselves. The cost to the American taxpayer would probably be several hundred million dollars that must be set aside as insurance against an Israeli default.
Now that Yitzhak Rabin has defeated Shimon Peres in the Labor Party runoff to determine who will lead their party in the Israeli national election on June 23, Mr. Shamir may have a greater incentive to compromise with Washington, American officials say. The latest Israeli polls show that Mr. Rabin will be a much more formidable foe for Mr. Shamir, and may force the Prime Minister to try to attract the Israeli centrist voter.
Mr. Rabin is well liked by both President Bush and Secretary of State Baker, and Administration officials believe that an Israeli government led by Mr. Rabin would be more likely to reach an agreement with the Palestinians on self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. They also believe that Mr. Rabin would be more willing to accept the sort of halt to building new settlements that the Administration is demanding for the loan guarantees. This is another reason that the Administration has little incentive to soften its terms now to accommodate, and possibly strengthen, Mr. Shamir.
 
Talks Scheduled to Resume
 The Middle East peace talks are scheduled to resume in Washington on Monday, and despite the latest outbreak of fighting along the Israel-Lebanon border, all four sides in the talks -- Israel, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and the Palestinians -- have said they still intend to attend.
This could be the last chance for substantive progress in these negotiations for several months. March and April will be occupied with the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and the Jewish festival of Passover, after which the Israeli election campaign will begin. The talks will likely have to be put off until the Israeli vote.
In Congress, Representative David Obey, Democrat of Wisconsin and the chairman of the House Foreign Operations subcommittee, held hearings today on the loan guarantee question. Mr. Obey, whose subcommittee overseas foreign aid, made it clear that although he supports in principle helping Israel resettle Russian Jews, he also wants to see a freeze on Israeli settlements in the occupied territores as a pre-condition to the loan guarantees.
In a statement issued recently on the issue, Mr. Obey said: "I fully support the President in declining to support a blank check $10 billion loan guarantee to Israel."

HEADLINE: U.S. to Use Antitrust Law As Weapon in Trade Fights

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 21

 BODY:
Attorney General William P. Barr said today that he expected the Bush Administration to change its antitrust policy within weeks to allow the Justice Department to sue foreign trade groups that discriminate against American exporters.
Bush trade officials have said with increasing frequency in recent months that foreign business practices, rather than laws and regulations, are the biggest trade barriers still facing American companies overseas. 
 Japanese companies, in particular, tend to buy from other Japanese companies in which they hold shares, instead of importing American products that may be cheaper or of better quality. Because the financial base of Japanese industry is built on such interlocking share holdings, opportunities for American exports have been limited.
Japanese officials tend to agree that Japan's large industrial groups, which are known as keiretsu and typically include everything from banks and insurers to steel and automobile producers, are often too reluctant to deal with foreign companies. The Japanese Government has been stepping up its antitrust measures, but not fast enough to satisfy American trade negotiators.
Mr. Barr said today during the taping of the television program "John McLaughlin's One on One," to be broadcast this weekend, that the Justice Department was reviewing its policy with the State Department and the United States trade representative. He said he expected a change "within a matter of weeks."
He added, "I think the antitrust laws will be a useful tool against cartels that are excluding U.S. exports."
Mr. Barr denied that the Administration's apparent decision to change course was in any way motivated by political considerations. Trade disputes, particularly with Japan, have moved to the center of this year's Presidential election campaign with President Bush's trip to Tokyo last month and with the conservative columnist Patrick J. Buchanan's strong showing this week in the New Hampshire primary on a platform that emphasizes protectionism.
Eric L. Hirschhorn, a trade lawyer at Winston & Strawn in Washington and a former Assistant Secretary of Commerce during the Carter Administration, said a change in the Justice Department's guidelines might not make much of a practical difference.
Private companies and individuals have always been able to sue foreign trade groups for hurting their ability to import or export, but few, if any, cases have been successful, he said.
Hiroshi Hirabayashi, deputy chief of the Japanese Embassy here, said his Government's reaction to an American policy change would likely depend on how it was implemented.

HEADLINE: Your Taxes;
Use of Preparers May Be Waning

BYLINE: By Robert D. Hershey Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Tax preparation is considered an increasingly complex task, one that nearly half of Americans turn over to accountants, tax lawyers or other specialists.
Yet figures suggest that reliance on professional preparation may have begun to wane, easing last filing season to 46.4 percent of returns from a 1988 peak of 47.7 percent. A decade earlier the proportion was 37.9 percent. 
 The decline, according to an I.R.S. spokesman, probably results from the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which eliminated various deductions, and the development of simplified forms like the 1040-EZ. (For upper-bracket people and corporations, on the other hand, the filing job has gotten significantly harder in recent years.)
H & R Block Inc., which has 25 percent of the company's filing business, says its business continues to rise, mainly reflecting the I.R.S.'s ability for two seasons to accept returns electronically nationwide. "It brings in a lot of business," said Donald W. Ayers, the company's financial vice president and treasurer, noting that Block prepared 12,375,000 returns in 1991, up 771,000 for the year.
Academic work by Julie H. Collins at the University of North Carolina and two collaborators from California State University, Chico, has found that demand for preparation services has little to do with a desire to minimize effort. Rather, 70 percent of respondents said their main objective was to file accurate returns and 25 percent to minimize tax liability.
 
Surge of Early Filing
 Hard times seem to have prompted a surge in early filing as the size of refunds soars, Internal Revenue Service figures show.
Through mid-February, the Treasury sent $7.3 billion to 6.5 million couples and individuals, with checks averaging $1,122, or $140 more than in the comparable 1991 period. The number of returns filed was 26.4 million, 6.5 percent ahead of last year's pace, which was slowed by the gulf war.
The data pointed to a cash-short public eager to claim their refunds, which more than 75 percent of taxpayers arrange to collect each year despite the fact that this is tantamount to an interest-free loan to the Government.
The faster filing pace this year may also reflect the fact that there are many more jobless with the time to file early. At latest report, 8.9 million Americans were unemployed, compared with 7.7 million in January 1991.
Returns filed electronically have jumped more than 58 percent this year, to 6.2 million, or one of every four early returns. These produce refunds within a few weeks or even less if the money is to be paid directly into the taxpayer's bank account.
The Treasury said it opposed providing a tax credit to those who file this way, contending that electronic filers get more benefit from faster refunds than the Government gets from reduced processing costs. Representative Newt Gingrich, a Georgia Republican, suggested a credit but without specifying its size.
The I.R.S. also reported this week that more than 122,000 South Carolinians have participated so far this year in a program under which they can electronically file Federal and state returns together, with the I.R.S. relaying data to the state. This system, tested in parts of South Carolina in 1991, is being extended this year on a refund-only basis to parts of New York, Maine, North Carolina, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Kansas.
 
Footnotes
 * A survey by the General Accounting Office has found that fewer than one-half of 1 percent of the 11.6 million taxpayers receiving the earned-income credit in 1989 took advantage of their right to collect cash, through employers, in periodic installments throughout the year. The agency said participation has never exceeded 1 percent since the option was first offered in 1979.
* New and increased taxes proposed by the District of Columbia include a 2 percent levy on the gross receipts of professionals. Lawyers, accountants, architects, engineers and consultants are expected to be hit for $5 million this year and $26.8 million in 1993. A tax on the health industry, including doctors, would raise $20 million.
