HEADLINE: Uncertainty Driving Treasury Bill Fluctuations

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
In normal times, it is hard to find a financial market that is more boring than the one where short-term Treasury bills are traded.
But these are not normal times.
In the last two weeks -- and particularly late last week -- there were moves in Treasury bill prices that indicated rising worry that the American government might not honor its obligations, or at least might not do so on time.
The worst impact was on bills that come due in August and early September. Prices of bills that mature after that suffered a little, but there seemed to be more confidence that by then the political impasse over raising the debt ceiling would have been resolved. 
Of course, a month ago there was great confidence on Wall Street that a resolution would have been reached well before Tuesday, when the Obama administration said the government would otherwise run out of money.
A Treasury bill is simply a promise by the United States government that it will pay $10,000 on a particular date. Under normal circumstances, of course, a bill that matures a month from now would cost a little less than one that matures next week.
But that was not true on Friday. The $10,000 bill that matures this Thursday traded for as little as $9,970.50, a discount of $29.50. But a bill that matures Sept. 29 -- eight weeks later -- never traded for less than $9,991.50, a discount of $8.50.
Why would anyone pay less for a dollar to be delivered within a week than they would pay for one to be delivered nearly two months later?
The answer is certainty, or a lack thereof.
To many investors in Treasury bills, time is critical. Bills are often held because a company knows it must come up with a large amount of cash on a particular day. If you owe $10,000 this Thursday, then owning a Treasury bill maturing that day would normally mean you were completely covered.
But what if there is a day or two delay? Or a week or two? What if no one will buy it from you on the due date without a significant discount in price? If that means you cannot meet your obligations, you may face a penalty far larger than a few dollars. Do you really want to take that risk?
Some chose not to last week, and that was why prices fell.
The prices seen last week, it should be noted, did not indicate real worries about a default that continues for a substantial period of time. There is, after all, no doubt that the United States can meet its obligations if its government is willing to do so. The question is one of will.
The discounts may seem teeny, and they would be if interest rates were at normal levels. But the Federal Reserve has pushed rates down, and money the world over has flowed to Treasury bills in a flight to safety. They are normally viewed as the very definition of a risk-free investment.
In fact, there have been times when Treasury bills sold for more than face value. That would seem to make no sense, but such bills are sometimes seen as more convenient than cash.
Just two weeks ago, the $10,000 Treasury bill that matures on Aug. 11 traded for $10,000.50. On Friday, it traded for $9,973.50.
When the bills that mature on Thursday were issued in February, the discount was only $8.50, providing an annual interest rate of 0.17 percent. An investor who held that bill for 25 of the 26 weeks, and then sold late last week, ended up with a loss.
That is not supposed to happen with a risk-free investment. But until now, no one feared that Congress would refuse to allow the government to live up to its obligations.

HEADLINE: A Geography Report

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS

 BODY:
The Department of Education recently released the results of its national geography survey of students in grades 4, 8 and 12.
The good news is that students did not do all that poorly: Fifty-six percent of high school seniors knew, for instance, that glaciation formed the Great Lakes. The bad news is that students have not shown much improvement from previous exams and that only about one in four fourth graders was able to identify all seven continents correctly.
Arnold Goldstein, program director for the assessment division of the National Center for Education Statistics, and David P. Driscoll, chairman of the National Assessment Governing Board, which administers the test, discuss. 
(In the meantime, here is a question 90 percent of 12th graders got wrong on the 1994 test: Which of the following countries has the largest volume and value of trade with the United States? A. Japan, B. Great Britain, C. Canada, D. Germany; answer is below.)
Q. Can you describe the test?
DR. GOLDSTEIN: The Nation's Report Card is a series of assessments done on a sample basis on a series of selected subjects. In addition to geography, we test reading and math, science, writing, economics and the arts. It is Congressionally mandated. The National Assessment Governing Board decides which subjects will be tested and what students should know.
Q. The previous national geography tests were given in 1994 and 2001. Have there been any notable differences in the results?
DR. GOLDSTEIN: We keep the assessments more or less the same so we can measure change. In general, we've found fourth graders have improved some, eighth graders have remained the same, and 12th graders have declined a bit from 1994 and 2001. In 2010, 79 percent of fourth graders, 74 percent of eighth graders and 70 percent of 12th graders performed at basic level or above, which means they had at least a basic understanding of geography. Those who were proficient, which means they had a mastery of the subject, were 21 percent of fourth graders, 27 percent of eighth graders and 20 percent of 12th graders.
Q. Why is the material on this geography exam considered important?
DR. DRISCOLL: Well, it's kind of a philosophical question about what kids should know. We often talk about math and reading with No Child Left Behind, and people complain that other areas are not being focused on. We test on many areas, including the arts and economics. I think it is an American tradition for kids to have a broad educational background.
Q. Do the results say anything about the American education system?
DR. DRISCOLL: They tell us a couple of things. We're seeing a bit of a trend of the floor being raised. Poor kids are showing a modest improvement. But it also shows that kids just aren't curious. They aren't reading about these things and therefore they don't have the knowledge. They don't work hard enough. Kids know the lyrics to their favorite song but can't for some reason remember who the vice president is. Schools didn't cause the problem, but I think America should be raising standards, and the education system is not doing what it should to counteract it.
Q. A lot of teachers say too much class time is devoted to preparing students for standardized reading and math tests instead of being spent on more broad-based learning. What do you think?
DR. DRISCOLL: I don't agree with that, but there is too much time being spent on tests. The assessments are telling us what we need to know. When Shanghai leaped to the top in PISA [Note: He is referring to the results last year of the Program for International Student Assessment, in which Chinese students topped students in the United States and the rest of the world in science, reading and math.] and even the president said this was a ''Sputnik moment,'' and it lasted one day. Too often we blame the test. The test is just the mirror.
Answer: C -- Canada, which remained first as of 2010, narrowly ahead of China. More questions are available at nationsreportcard.gov/testyourself.asp.

HEADLINE: To Escape Chaos, a Terrible Deal: Democrats won almost nothing they wanted except avoiding default

 BODY:
There is little to like about the tentative agreement between Congressional leaders and the White House except that it happened at all. The deal would avert a catastrophic government default, immediately and probably through the end of 2012. The rest of it is a nearly complete capitulation to the hostage-taking demands of Republican extremists. It will hurt programs for the middle class and poor, and hinder an economic recovery.
It is not yet set in stone, and there may still be time to make it better. But in the end, most Democrats will have no choice but to swallow their fury, accept the deal and, we hope, fight harder the next time. 
For weeks, ever since House Republicans said they would not raise the nation's debt ceiling without huge spending cuts, Democrats have held out for a few basic principles. There must be new tax revenues in the mix so that the wealthy bear a share of the burden and Medicare cannot be affected.
Those principles were discarded to get a deal that cuts about $2.5 trillion from the deficit over a decade. The first $900 billion to a trillion will come directly from domestic discretionary programs (about a third of it from the Pentagon) and will include no new revenues. The next $1.5 trillion will be determined by a ''supercommittee'' of 12 lawmakers that could recommend revenues, but is unlikely to do so since half its members will be Republicans.
If the committee is deadlocked, or its recommendations are rejected by either house of Congress, then a dreaded guillotine of cuts would come down: $1.2 trillion in across-the-board spending reductions that would begin to go into effect by early 2013.
Negotiators have tried to make this penalty mechanism as unpalatable as possible to provide an incentive for the supercommittee and Congress to avert it. For Democrats, the penalty would include cuts to Medicare providers. The penalty for Republicans should have been new tax revenues, but of course they refused to consider that and got their way. Instead, their incentive will be trying to avoid large cuts in the military budget.
Democrats won a provision drawn from automatic-cut mechanisms in previous decades that exempts low-income entitlement programs. There is no requirement that a balanced-budget amendment pass Congress. There will be no second hostage-taking on the debt ceiling in a few months, as Speaker John Boehner and his band of radicals originally demanded. Democratic negotiators decided that the automatic cut system, as bad as it is, was less of a threat to the economy than another default crisis, and many are counting on future Congresses to undo its arbitrary butchering.
Sadly, in a political environment laced with lunacy, that calculation is probably correct. Some Republicans in the House were inviting a default, hoping that an economic earthquake would shake Washington and the Obama administration beyond recognition. Democrats were right to fear the effects of a default and the impact of a new recession on all Americans.
President Obama could have been more adamant in dealing with Republicans, perhaps threatening to use constitutional powers to ignore the debt ceiling if Congress abrogated its responsibility to raise it. But this episode demonstrates the effectiveness of extortion. Reasonable people are forced to give in to those willing to endanger the national interest.
Democrats can look forward to the expiration of the Bush tax cuts next year, and will have to make the case in the 2012 elections for new lawmakers who will undo the damage.

HEADLINE: Opposing the Health Law, Florida Refuses Millions of Dollars

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- When it comes to pursuing federal largess, most of the states that oppose the 2010 health care law have refused to let either principle or politics block their paths to the trough. If Washington is doling out dollars, Republican governors and legislators typically figure they might as well get their share.
Then there is Florida. Despite having the country's fourth-highest unemployment rate, its second-highest rate of people without insurance and a $3.7 billion budget gap this year, the state has turned away scores of millions of dollars in grants made available under the Affordable Care Act. And it is not pursuing grants worth many millions more.
In recent months, either Gov. Rick Scott's administration or the state's Republican-controlled Legislature has rejected grants aimed at moving long-term care patients into their homes, curbing child abuse through in-home counseling and strengthening state regulation of health premiums. They have shunned money to help sign up eligible recipients for Medicare, educate teenagers on preventing pregnancy and plan for the health insurance exchanges that the law requires by 2014. 
While 36 states shared $27 million to counsel health insurance consumers, Florida did not apply for the grants. And in drafting this year's budget, the Legislature failed to authorize an $8.3 million federal grant won by a county health department to expand community health centers.
In interviews, Mr. Scott, a Republican, and state legislative leaders were clear about their rationale. They said they detested everything about the federal health law, which was declared unconstitutional by a federal judge in a case filed by the state. Unless ordered to do otherwise by an appellate court, they said, they had no intention of putting it in place, even if that meant leaving money on the table.
''There are a lot of programs that the federal government would like to give you that don't fit your state, don't fit your needs and ultimately create obligations that our taxpayers can't afford,'' said Mr. Scott, a former hospital company executive who rose to political prominence by financing an advertising campaign against the health care legislation.
State Representative Matt Hudson, the chairman of the Health Care Appropriations Subcommittee, said his chamber's leadership felt the same way.
''I do not believe that act is the right thing for the country or the right thing for Florida,'' Mr. Hudson said, ''and I am not going to start implementing things that I don't believe in.'' Asked whether states had the authority to stymie federal law, Mr. Hudson answered, ''We're not required to accept a grant.''
Florida is by no means the only state hostile to the health care law. A majority of those states have gone to federal court to challenge the law's central requirement that most Americans obtain health insurance. Alaska, Oklahoma and Wisconsin, among others, have turned away grants, some of them substantial.
But many of the states challenging the law have taken a posture more like that of Idaho, where Gov. C. L. Otter, a Republican, made a show this spring of ordering his agencies not to pursue Affordable Care Act grants and then quickly issued 10 exceptions to that rule.
Florida has had few peers in subverting the law's provisions since Mr. Scott took office in January. After a federal district judge in Pensacola invalidated the entire act later that month, Mr. Scott quickly put the brakes on planning for the insurance exchanges and started rejecting grants pursued by his predecessor, Charlie Crist, a more moderate Republican. The state maintained its stance even though the judge, Roger Vinson, suspended his ruling pending appellate review.
''I don't want to waste either federal money or state money on something that's unconstitutional,'' Mr. Scott said in a 30-minute interview in his office on Friday.
The governor, sporting black cowboy boots embossed with the state seal, said his subordinates had made case-by-case decisions about whether particular grants advanced the state's efforts to remake its Medicaid program. This year, Mr. Scott and the Legislature enacted Florida's own law directing most recipients into managed care plans.
But Mr. Scott deflected requests to explain where the line was drawn, other than to say that competition, personal choice and quality incentives should drive the health care market.
''I'd have to go through each program to look at it,'' Mr. Scott said. ''We have a Medicaid plan, so if it fits with that plan, then we're interested, and if it doesn't, we're not.''
In distancing itself from the law, Florida declined to participate in a Medicaid pilot program that would have authorized up to $2 million in reimbursement to providers using a new hospice model for severely ill children. The state insurance commissioner applied to the Obama administration for a waiver from this year's requirement that health insurers spend at least 80 percent of premium revenue on medical care. Only at the last minute did the State Health Department agree to provide required letters of support for community groups applying for federal wellness and prevention grants.
Critics say the state's Republican leadership has carried its opposition to the health care law too far. The grants being shunned by the state, they point out, have little connection to the provisions that Florida is challenging in court, namely the insurance mandate and the expansion of Medicaid eligibility.
''It's simply unconscionable that they're turning back federal tax dollars that our citizens and businesses pay and sending those tax dollars to other states,'' said Representative Kathy Castor, a Democrat who represents the Tampa Bay area. ''Florida's economy has been hit very hard, and we need every dollar and every job in our state.''
Health care advocates scoff at the assertion by Mr. Scott and the Legislature that some of the rejected grants would duplicate existing state programs (a few of the grants require a state contribution).
''Residents will suffer if the grants are turned away,'' said Elizabeth M. Rugg, the director of the Suncoast Health Council in St. Petersburg. ''There's a lot of need in Florida, as everywhere else.''
Although Florida is the fourth most populous state, it ranks 12th in the amount of money received from health care act grants, according to the government's grant-tracking Web site. The law has directed $46.4 million to the state out of $1.98 billion awarded nationally. Much of the money has gone directly to local governments, community groups and medical providers.
Three of four grants to expand community health clinics in Florida went to medical centers that are beyond the reach of the governor and the Legislature. The fourth was to the Osceola County Health Department, which under Florida law is effectively a unit of state government. The Legislature used its power to not authorize a grant won by the county to expand two health centers and build a third.
''The speaker had a policy that we weren't going to be implementing any part of health care reform, so those grants were not included in our budget,'' said Katherine Betta, a spokeswoman for Dean Cannon, a Republican and speaker of the State House.
Some of the forsaken grants were for small amounts, but others, over time, would have infused state programs with substantial sums. As long as the state makes no moves toward setting up an insurance exchange, it will not compete for grants worth tens of millions of dollars to help establish them and invest in needed technology. If Florida does not demonstrate adequate progress by early 2013, the federal government can take over the state's exchange.
Although many conservative governors consider that the worst scenario, Mr. Scott said his antipathy toward the exchanges was so strong that he would oppose running it. ''I'd rather nobody run it,'' Mr. Scott said. ''I don't think there's any way the state can do it where it's good for health care policy.''

HEADLINE: Data Centers' Power Use Less Than Was Expected

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- Data centers' unquenchable thirst for electricity has been slaked by the global recession and by a combination of new power-saving technologies, according to an independent report on data center power use from 2005 to 2010.
The report, by Jonathan G. Koomey, a consulting professor in the civil and environmental engineering department at Stanford University, found that the actual number of computer servers declined significantly compared to 2010 forecasts because of this lowered demand for computing and because of the financial crisis of 2008 and the emergence of technologies like more efficient computer chips and computer server virtualization, which allows fewer servers to run more programs. 
The slowing of growth in consumption contradicts a 2007 forecast by the Environmental Protection Agency that the explosive expansion of the Internet and the computerization of society would lead to a doubling of power consumed by data centers from 2005 to 2010.
In the new study, prepared at the request of The New York Times, Mr. Koomey found that electricity used by data centers worldwide grew significantly, but it was an increase of only about 56 percent from 2005 to 2010. In the United States, power consumption increased by 36 percent, according to Mr. Koomey's report, titled ''Growth in Data Center Power Use 2005 to 2010.''
''Mostly because of the recession, but also because of a few changes in the way these facilities are designed and operated, data center electricity consumption is clearly much lower than what was expected, and that's really the big story,'' said Mr. Koomey.
Though Mr. Koomey was unable to separate the impact of the recession from that of energy-saving technologies, the decline in use is surprising because data centers, buildings that house racks and racks of computers, have become so central to modern life. They are used to process e-mail, conduct Web searches and handle online shopping as well as banking transactions and corporate sales reports.
Moreover, in the period studied, more services that depend on data centers, like cloud computing and streaming of music and movies, became popular.
The influential report issued by the E.P.A. in August of 2007 estimated that national energy consumption by computer servers and data centers would nearly double from 2005 to 2010 to roughly 100 billion kilowatt hours of energy at an annual cost of $7.4 billion. It predicted the centers' demand for power in the United States would rise by 2011 to 12 gigawatts of power, or the output of 25 major power plants, from 7 gigawatts, or about 15 power plants.
Industry consultants and executives agreed with Mr. Koomey's new analysis, but they also indicated that the slower growth might be temporary.
''Of course, the market is expanding,'' said Jimmy Clidaras, principal engineer for platforms and infrastructure at Google. ''We're doing stuff today in the cloud that we never would have thought of. Music used to be at home and now it's in the sky.''
''The numbers do make sense,'' said Kenneth Brill, founder of the Uptime Institute, an industry consulting group based in Santa Fe, N.M. ''But they shouldn't be taken as indicating the problem's over. There is certainly increasing energy consumption and that should be a concern for everyone.''
The slowdown in the rate of growth of electricity use is particularly significant because it comes in the midst of the biggest build-out of new data center capacity in the history of the industry.
Fueled by an insatiable demand for new Internet services and a shift to so-called cloud computing services that are largely hosted in commercial data centers and in the large data farms operated by companies like Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft and Facebook, there has been an increasing discussion about the growing percentage of the nation's electricity that will be consumed by vast data centers being constructed at a record pace.
But the new report indicates that electricity used by global data centers in 2010 remained relatively modest. ''Electricity used in global data centers likely accounted for between 1.1 percent and 1.5 percent of total electricity use, respectively. For the U.S. that number was between 1.7 percent and 2.2 percent,'' according to the report.
In an earlier paper, Mr. Koomey reported that the power used by servers in data centers represented about 0.5 percent of world electricity consumption in 2005. When cooling and auxiliary infrastructure were included, that figure was about 1 percent, he wrote. The worldwide demand for data center power in 2005 was equivalent to the output of about 17 1,000-megawatt power plants.
As part of his latest research, Mr. Koomey was able to get a more detailed estimate of Google's contribution to the global growth of power consumption by data centers than has been previously publicly available. Google, which generally builds custom computer servers for its data centers, has been secretive about the number of servers that it uses to power services like Google Search and YouTube.
However, in May a Google executive told Mr. Koomey that the company's total data center electricity use was less than 1 percent of the Koomey report's estimate of electricity consumed by data centers worldwide.
If the estimate is accurate, it could confirm the widely held industry perception that Google, with its many large data centers, is relatively more efficient than the mainstream of the data center industry. A vast majority of data center designers choose to use standard industry equipment, not equipment specialized for particular computing tasks.

HEADLINE: From Big Spending to Big Cuts, All While the Economy Stalls

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM and CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The nation's political leaders agreed on Sunday to spend and invest less money in the American economy, a step that economists said risks the reversal of a faltering recovery, in the hope of improving the nation's long-term prosperity.
The emerging outlines of a deal to cut spending by at least $2.4 trillion over 10 years, with a multibillion-dollar down payment later this year, would complete an about-face in the federal government's role from outsize spending in the immediate aftermath of the recession to outsize cuts in the future.
Last week brought the disconcerting news that the economy grew no faster than the population during the first six months of the year, in part because of spending cuts by state and local governments. Now the federal government is cutting, too.
''Unemployment will be higher than it would have been otherwise,'' Mohamed El-Erian, chief executive of the bond investment firm Pimco, said Sunday on ABC. ''Growth will be lower than it would be otherwise. And inequality will be worse than it would be otherwise.'' 
He added, ''We have a very weak economy, so withdrawing more spending at this stage will make it even weaker.''
The agreement would end months of single-minded debate about the federal debt that has diverted Washington's attention from broader economic questions, and indeed threatened the health of financial markets as investors watched and wondered whether the United States might really decide, quite voluntarily, to leave some bills unpaid.
If both chambers of Congress give their approval by Tuesday night, the government will have averted the danger of a self-inflicted financial crisis, but only at the expense of public confidence in its ability to address the nation's broader economic malaise.
The looming challenges include a renewal of the standoff over the federal budget at the end of September, and the scheduled expiration at the end of 2012 of the broad tax cuts passed during the administration of President George W. Bush.
President Obama said Sunday night that the deal ''begins to lift the cloud of debt and the cloud of uncertainty that hangs over the economy.'' He added that political leaders now ''should be devoting all of our time'' to the nation's broader economic challenges.
But economists say the deal could complicate that task. There is broad agreement that the United States needs to pay down its debts, but most economists say the government should have waited a year or more for the economy to strengthen.
''We sure missed a big window of opportunity to reduce our debt in those strong years when asset prices were booming,'' said Carmen Reinhart, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and co-author of ''This Time Is Different,'' a history of debt crises. ''Instead we're stuck trying to do it now, when the economy is so weak.''
The economy grew at an annual rate of only 0.8 percent during the first half of the year. Millions of homes remain empty. Twenty-five million Americans could not find full-time jobs last month. And even without the debt ceiling deal, federal spending is in rapid decline. Little remains of the federal stimulus money. Payroll tax cuts are set to expire at the end of the year.
The combination of the budget-cutting government's plans and the grim economic news is likely to increase pressure on the Federal Reserve, which will hold a scheduled meeting on Aug. 9, to reconsider its declaration earlier this summer that it has done enough to aid the economic recovery.
After four years of extraordinary efforts to promote growth, including a continuing campaign to hold down interest rates for at least a few more months, officials at the central bank say they are reluctant to do more. But the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said if the economy deteriorates and there is a growing risk of deflation or a broad decline in prices, policy makers could act.
The Fed's options include pledging to maintain low interest rates for a specified period of time or increasing its holding of government debt in a bid to further reduce rates.
''It's difficult to find a textbook to tell you what should you do now,'' said Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank.
The Republican authors of the debt ceiling deal say that cutting the size of government will increase economic growth down the road because federal borrowing soaks up money otherwise available to private businesses and federal spending distributes that money inefficiently.
Some conservative economists argue that even the immediate impact of a deal could be positive. Classic economic theory holds that people respond to the growth of government by spending less of their own money, because they assume that taxes will increase. A reduction in the federal debt therefore should encourage people to spend more of their money.
''From an accounting point of view, it seems obvious that you would reduce G.D.P. if you cut government spending,'' said Randall Kroszner, an economics professor at the University of Chicago and a former Fed governor appointed by Mr. Bush. ''But the key is really the impact on consumption and investment. If you reduce government spending and if people think that reduces uncertainty about the tax burden down the line, they may be more comfortable with spending.''
Economists who have examined the historical record, however, say the evidence is clear that the immediate impact of spending cuts outweighs any short-term benefits to confidence.
''When you look at the history of these things, the finding is that we shouldn't be kidding ourselves,'' said Paolo Mauro, chief of the fiscal affairs department at the International Monetary Fund and the editor of a book of case studies, ''Chipping Away at Public Debt.'' ''When you do fiscal adjustment in the near term, it does have an adverse impact on economic growth.''
Northrop Grumman, a major military contractor, is a case in point. The company said Wednesday that second-quarter sales were depressed by the confusion in Washington.
''Uncertainties surrounding the debt ceiling and future defense budgets caused our customers to move more slowly and spend more conservatively,'' the chief executive, Wesley G. Bush, told analysts. ''We did not see the recovery in spending that one might have expected.''
The deal on the table on Sunday, however, is likely to include reductions in defense spending.
The broader impact depends on the details. The cuts stretch over a decade, and the White House has pushed to limit the impact by delaying the largest cuts, giving the economy time to recover. And the value of federal spending also varies widely. Some spending is wasteful.
''Cutting infrastructure spending is generally thought to be a bad idea, but if that money was being spent on a bridge to nowhere, it's not so concerning,'' Mr. Mauro said.
Another feature that could limit the economic impact is an agreement to negotiate more than half of the cuts over the next several months. Ms. Reinhart said countries often did the greatest economic damage by agreeing on cuts at the 11th hour, in the desperate rush to complete a deal, without sufficient attention to the particulars.
''That's when politicians make the worst decisions often -- they cut the things that would yield short-term revenues,'' Ms. Reinhart said. ''They cut discretionary spending in the ways that if you really thought about it, they wouldn't do it that way.''

HEADLINE: Muscling Through a Murky, Hardcore Night in a Box

BYLINE: By BEN RATLIFF

 BODY:
People straighten up around John Joseph, the singer for the Cro-Mags. He reminds you that the best of his music, New York hardcore, has a history and a set of standards, musical and ethical; he has no time for what people choose to do outside of those standards. He's not hectoring you, exactly, about punk and veganism and the economy and your ability to rise to the occasion; he's making strong recommendations and asking withering questions. Like ''What are you, tired?''
He felt necessary around 10:30 on Friday night, when the atmosphere at the House of Vans skate park had grown flushed, endothermic, droopy. Vans, the sneaker company, has been holding free concerts this summer in its huge warehouselike space in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, making tickets available online. The show on Friday was a strong four-band slate of hardcore and post-hardcore, with the Cro-Mags, the Screaming Females and two excellent groups whose names can't be published here, one from Philadelphia and one from Toronto. (The Philadelphia band's singer is Matt Korvette, and its most recent album is ''King of Jeans''; the Toronto band's singer is Damian Abraham, a k a Pink Eyes, and its new album is ''David Comes to Life.'') 
But back to the House of Vans. Before the doors opened, the ticketed fans lined up into the vanishing point along Kent Avenue, near the waterfront. (At a far-off spot, the line intersected with another, perkier line for They Might Be Giants, which played a free concert a half-mile away at East River State Park.) They piled inside and essentially entered a commercial, with water, beer and liquor provided by sponsors. The room is a concrete box; you know, not great for sound. It's all right when you're up front, with your head in the stage speaker. But up front at a Cro-Mags show, where the pit gets hectic, you have to be ready for blindsidings. Twenty feet back, and the sound starts to blur. Forty feet back, and you start thinking about the free stuff.
The openers did as well as they could. Mr. Korvette enacted his abstract physical comedy, high-kicking over a microphone stand and striking feminine poses against his band's butch, ugly riffs. The 24-year-old Marissa Paternoster of the New Jersey trio Screaming Females created a force field around her guitar, playing a slurry of punk and power-pop from a time that just predates her physical life.
And Mr. Abraham shouted like an enraged dad while performing almost the entire set in the arms of the audience, or it in his. The band raced through some new songs from ''David Comes to Life,'' conceived as a four-act rock opera, and Mr. Abraham's voice was like an unchanging uniform, proclaiming punk affiliations. But the hope and buoyancy in the new songs -- they've been compared a few times already to Bruce Springsteen's -- and the layering of lines among three guitarists, sometimes for harmony, sometimes for depth, implied constant crescendo: struggle moving toward transcendence and evolution. There's an obvious contradiction in there, which is the band's charm and its road ahead.
But the Cro-Mags found ways to do what the Toronto band couldn't quite do: achieve focus in a soupy room. One was Mackie Jayson's snare-drum hits: almost comically hard and high-pitched, like a crowbar swung against a PVC pipe. Another was A. J. Novello's down-strummed guitar chords, heavy and clotted. Another was Mr. Joseph, who's been singing for the band off and on since the mid-'80s and who looks as if he's in perpetual training for situations like this, when he needs not only to excite a crowd but also to resuscitate it.
Except for Mr. Joseph and Mr. Jayson, this was neither the original Cro-Mags of the 1986 album ''Age of Quarrel,'' an imposing, important and totally uncuddly record, nor the versions of the group represented on two Cro-Mags Web sites separately associated with the band members Parris Mayhew and Harley Flanagan, who are seemingly estranged from each other and from Mr. Joseph. (The others are Queens hardcore gentry: Mr. Novello was in the band Leeway, and the bassist Craig Setari has a history with Sick of It All and Agnostic Front.)
But the music was properly representative, with the right near-metal sound mass and the right motion. It moved in the hardcore swing descending directly from Bad Brains, the band Mr. Joseph has felt close to since he roadied for the group in the early '80s. As he sang and barked to a set of songs from that age -- many from ''Age of Quarrel,'' as well as ''Attitude'' and ''Right Brigade'' by Bad Brains -- he stayed at his two stations: either the lip of the stage or in front of Mr. Jayson's bass drum. He moved his hips in half-time to the rhythm and otherwise worked from the knees, a cross between boxing footwork and skanking; he spent a full hour on his toes.
The next concert at House of Vans is on Thursday: Man Man, Glass Candy and Crystal Antlers; vans.com/microsites/houseparties.

HEADLINE: $400 Million Plan on Nassau Coliseum Goes to Vote

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON and ANGELA MACROPOULOS

 BODY:
For decades, planners, politicians and businessmen have debated the future of the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum and the land around it. On Monday, residents will have the chance to vote on the latest proposal.
The plan before the voters would overhaul the Coliseum and the surrounding 77 acres. It includes spending $400 million to build a new arena for the New York Islanders hockey team, a minor league baseball park and new convention space.
But like so many other land use issues on Long Island, this plan, unveiled in May, has proved to be contentious, setting off finger-pointing, backbiting and political posturing.
It has also been expensive: holding the vote in August, instead of on Election Day, will cost more than $2 million, and the Islanders and their supporters have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars more on billboards, radio and newspaper advertisements and robocalls. 
It has also created some unlikely allies. The backers of the deal include County Executive Edward P. Mangano and many other Republicans, construction unions, some land use groups, the Islanders and their fans, and even rival teams in the N.H.L., the Rangers and the Devils.
The proposal is opposed by Democratic leaders, fiscal conservatives and some developers, who say that the financially beleaguered county should not be going further into debt to help Charles Wang, who owns the Islanders, and that the property could generate far more in taxes if it were privately developed.
The vote comes at a pivotal time. The finances of Nassau County, one of the most affluent counties in the United States, are such a mess that they are monitored by the Nassau County Interim Finance Authority, a fiscal control board authorized by the state. The county could run a deficit of up to $140 million this year, the authority said, adding that if the arena deal is approved, voters could pay 4 percent more in property taxes.
Like others who view sports venues as economic stimuli, Mr. Mangano and his backers say that the property tax increases will be more than offset by the creation of new jobs and $400 million in profits that they expect to be produced during the 30-year life of the bonds issued to pay for the project.
They also say that if a new arena is not built, the Islanders will move and Nassau will lose thousands of jobs and a cultural hub.
As cities like Cincinnati, Houston and Seattle have learned, the construction of stadiums and arenas almost always costs more than expected, rarely produces the economic benefits initially promised and can saddle local governments with tens of millions of dollars in debts, driving holes through budgets.
So while many Nassau residents prefer to replace an arena they consider an outdated eyesore (it was built in 1972) because they still want a place to see concerts and sporting events, they are mindful that it will quite likely come at a heavy cost.
''I'm on the border on this,'' said Bob Orosz, 64, a retired radiological technician who lives in Garden City and recently attended a presentation on the plan by county officials.
''It's a Catch-22,'' he said. ''If it's passed, our taxes are going to go up. If it fails, our taxes are going to go up.''
If the referendum passes on Monday, the plan will go to the Nassau County Legislature and to the finance authority; either one could revise or kill the deal.
The contention around the subject is matched by contention about the vote itself.
Critics say that by holding the referendum on a Monday in August, when many voters are on vacation or disinterested, Mr. Mangano is trying to ensure that only residents with a strong interest, like construction workers and hockey fans, will head to the polls. They say it would have been fairer as well as cheaper to hold the vote on Election Day.
William T. Biamonte, the Democratic commissioner on the Nassau County Board of Elections, said, ''The sad thing is if we did this in November, it wouldn't cost us 10 cents and there would be more public input.''
The county executive has said a vote during the summer ensures that the measure is not buried on the ballot and turned into a political sticking point.
And Mr. Wang, who has been uncharacteristically visible during the campaign, has promised to cover the costs of the special election, if the ballot measure passes.
But as in so many campaigns to persuade voters to pay for big projects, the sharpest barbs have been traded over the economics of the plan.
The county executive and the Islanders point to several studies that say a new arena will produce the equivalent of 1,515 construction jobs, 3,040 permanent jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars of profit after the construction bonds are paid off.
''We believe that the rewards here significantly outweigh the risks associated with creating a sports entertainment destination,'' Mr. Mangano said.
Although the finance authority said it expected property taxes to rise 3.5 percent to 4 percent if the county issues $400 million in bonds, Michael Picker, senior vice president of the Islanders, said it would be a reasonable price to pay to keep the team; its lease expires in 2015.
If the team were to leave, he said, the Coliseum would be unable to compete with arenas in Manhattan, Brooklyn and elsewhere.
Mr. Mangano said that there was no Plan B, and that the Coliseum would have trouble surviving without the Islanders. Still, critics of the plan say the county executive and the team are not telling voters that there are other options.
They include refurbishment of the arena, new owners for the team, and other types of development, including elements of a mixed-use Lighthouse Project that Mr. Wang once championed.
Opponents also say the forecasts for the arena are unreasonable. The construction jobs, while potentially lucrative, will be temporary, and 2,000 people already work at the arena, so the number of new jobs would be smaller than advertised, they say.
The team and outside experts project attendance at the Coliseum to rise by about a third even as tickets prices increase. The Islanders make the assumption that they will host six playoff games a year, though the team has made the playoffs just four times since 1994.
Mark Hamer, a board member at the Association for a Better Long Island, which represents real estate developers, said that if the referendum passed, the lease would give Mr. Wang an inside track to develop the property, though the county executive insists that the county retains the rights. Mr. Hamer said the land could generate about $1 million in taxes per acre if it were privately developed, far more than the $14 million in minimum lease payments that Mr. Wang would pay under the proposal.
''Wang wants to make money and Mangano wants to save the Islanders,'' said Clifford B. Sondock, the president of the Land Use Institute, which opposes the project. ''Ed and Charles have made this an issue of the Islanders when it is really a real estate deal.''
The polls will be open for the referendum from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m.

HEADLINE: HSBC Bank to Announce It Will Cut 10,000 Jobs

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER and MICHAEL J. de la MERCED; Julia Werdigier reported from London and Michael J. de la Merced from New York.

 BODY:
LONDON -- HSBC, Europe's biggest bank, plans to announce thousands of job cuts on Monday as part of a wide-ranging cost-reduction program that started in May, a person with direct knowledge of the decision said Sunday. 
HSBC plans to cut about 10,000 jobs, or 3 percent of its global work force, said the person, who declined to be identified before the figures are made public. The bank, which employed 307,000 people at the end of last year, is expected to announce the job cuts when it reports earnings for the first half of this year on Monday. HSBC declined to comment on the job cuts, which were first reported by Sky News.
Meanwhile, on Sunday, the bank announced that it would sell 195 of its branches in upstate New York to the First Niagara Financial Group for about $1 billion. The branches being sold hold about $15 billion in deposits.
Stuart T. Gulliver, who took over as HSBC's chief executive in January, said in May that he was seeking to lower costs by at least $2.5 billion in the next two to three years mainly by scaling back the bank's retail operations outside Britain. HSBC said in May that it might also sell its bank card business in the United States. It has already withdrawn from the Russian retail banking market.
Mr. Gulliver has said that he plans to radically change HSBC's business in the United States, which has been a drag on group earnings mainly because of the bank's ill-advised acquisition of the subprime lender Household International in 2003. Mr. Gulliver has indicated that he hopes to strengthen the business by winning market share with its commercial banking unit.
To compensate for sluggish growth in Europe and its British home market, Mr. Gulliver also plans to win market share in faster-growing economies like those in Latin America and Asia, where HSBC has a historically strong presence. HSBC was helped through the subprime mortgage crisis by its growing business in Asia, where it continues to generate more than half its annual pretax profit.
HSBC would be the latest bank to announce job cuts. Credit Suisse said last week that it planned to eliminate 2,000 positions, or 4 percent of its global jobs. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are also reducing their head counts. The cuts are expected to help the banks improve returns despite slower economic growth and a stricter regulatory environment.
First Niagara's deal to purchase the HSBC branches in upstate New York would more than double its branch network in the region. As of the end of June, the firm, based in Buffalo, had 117 branches in upstate New York and 346 total.
First Niagara reportedly beat out several bigger competitors for the HSBC branches, including M&T Bank, whose market value is more than three times larger.
HSBC also plans to consolidate 13 of its branches in Connecticut and New Jersey into nearby existing locations.
HSBC's pretax profit for the six months to the end of June is expected to fall to $10.9 billion from $11.1 billion a year earlier, according to the average of analyst forecasts polled by Reuters.
HSBC's shares fell 8.7 percent this year, less than its British rival Barclays, which is set to report earnings on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Ticket Sales Start-Up Aims at Smaller Box Offices

BYLINE: By BEN SISARIO

 BODY:
On July 23, 3,000 carnivores salivated their way through Meatopia, a festival on a Brooklyn pier where 45 chefs from around the country offered fleshy dishes like veal belly gyros and Southern pulled-pork shooters.
Meatopia's patrons were also guinea pigs of another sort. The festival was a test case for a new ticketing system that allows anyone to operate a sophisticated box office -- complete with on-the-spot credit card processing and postevent data analysis -- using little more than an iPad.
The system was created by Eventbrite, a San Francisco company that in five years has carved out a niche in the multibillion-dollar ticketing industry by focusing not on stadiums and major league sports but on the thousands of events below Ticketmaster's radar. These can be as large as a Renaissance fair or as small as a private party. But they add up: last year Eventbrite sold 11 million tickets worth $207 million, and this year it projects $400 million in gross ticket sales. 
''The notion here is the democratization of ticketing,'' said Kevin Hartz, the company's chief executive. ''Things that were once available only to the biggest customers are made available to the masses. In the case of ticketing it was Madison Square Garden or the New York Yankees, but today any event large or small can have just as robust an offering for selling and managing tickets.''
Eventbrite is one of several young companies, including Ticketfly and Front Gate Tickets, that are challenging the major ticket providers by offering cheaper service, extensive social media integration and, most important to consumers, lower and simpler fees. But Eventbrite has perhaps the most aggressive growth strategy; for instance, it allows people to use it for free events for which tickets are required, at no charge.
Eventbrite sells tickets in advance through its Web site, but until now it has been ill-equipped to deal with sales at the door. At last year's Meatopia, for example, the walk-up line moved slowly, and valuable marketing information like e-mail addresses was not collected.
To deal with similar situations, and to compete more directly with the big guns of the industry, in June the company introduced Eventbrite at the Door. Using an iPad app and a credit card scanner, Eventbrite at the Door customers can let in advance ticket holders and sell 400 new tickets per hour.
Eventbrite's new system can handle events of any size, the company says. At Meatopia, fewer than 20 percent of tickets were sold at the door. But Randy Fisher, the executive producer, praised Eventbrite at the Door for how quickly it processed those transactions, and for the detailed analysis it generated.
''Eventbrite is to ticket sales what Google is to search terms,'' Mr. Fisher said. ''It was that quick.''
The company is not yet profitable, Mr. Hartz said. But it has notable support. In May, it raised $50 million from Tiger Global Management, bringing its total investment to $80 million. Its board includes a former chief executive of Ticketmaster, Sean Moriarty, who said that Eventbrite's fee structure was one of its biggest advantages.
The company charges consumers 2.5 percent of the cost of each ticket plus 99 cents, plus credit card charges of about 3 percent. For a $20 ticket, those fees would come to about $2.10, or 10.5 percent -- much less than customers are used to paying through Ticketmaster, where surcharges are often 30 percent or higher.
''We make every effort to run a profitable and successful business, but also do our best to make the fees appear fair and appropriate and not be a burden or an inhibitor to selling a ticket,'' Mr. Moriarty said.
But Eventbrite faces challenges in competing for the industry's major accounts. Ticket surcharges are deeply ingrained in the economics of the music business. Most theaters rely on the fees they get through major ticket providers. And while Eventbrite has surpassed many competing start-ups in sales volume, it is still a small fish compared with Ticketmaster, which last year sold about 120 million tickets worth $7.2 billion.
''A lot of people in the music business don't want ticketing democratized,'' said Josh Baron, editor of the music magazine Relix and co-author of the book ''Ticket Masters: The Rise of the Concert Industry and How the Public Got Scalped.'' ''It's a business, and venues want money.''
Mr. Hartz said that Eventbrite did not pay advances to theaters, as other ticketing companies did, and did not try to encourage theaters to sign exclusive contracts. That could hinder the company in its efforts to pursue the higher end of the concert business. But Mr. Hartz said he believed that Eventbrite still had plenty of room to grow.
''No event is too large or too small for Eventbrite,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Hopeful, But Wary At Money Markets

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Money market funds, stuffed with Treasury notes and other short-term government securities, have long been considered the safest of harbors by millions of investors and institutions alike. But with the prospect of a default or a downgrade in the nation's creditworthiness, billions of dollars have fled the funds as investors grapple with uncertainty.
In search of safer havens, investors have flocked to newer investments like federally guaranteed, zero-interest checking accounts. Fund managers, in turn, have increased cash levels and shifted their portfolios to hold even more investments that can be easily sold to meet investor withdrawals. 
Congress was working around the clock over the weekend to raise the debt ceiling by Tuesday, reaching a framework agreement late Sunday. But even a short-term Congressional deal will leave some uncertainty for money market investors.
One credit rating agency has held out the possibility that it would downgrade in the nation's credit rating even with a debt deal in place. Such a move would probably send even more investors toward the exits, fearful that fund managers will have to decide whether to sell off other holdings whose value could be affected by lower ratings.
But the greatest fear for a fund manager is that a fund ''breaks the buck'' -- that its share value falls below the stable $1-a-share price that money funds maintain. That happened in 2008, when the asset value of the Reserve Primary fund fell to 97 cents a share because of its large holdings of the debt of Lehman Brothers, which went bankrupt.
To break the buck, its value must fall by one-half of 1 percent, to 99.5 cents a share. Since Treasury bond prices move inversely with interest rates, if the market attaches greater risk to owning Treasuries, their interest rates would rise and prices would fall to attract buyers. A steep swing in rates and prices could cause the value of a money market fund to sink below the $1 level.
Chris Plantier, a senior economist at the Investment Company Institute, a mutual fund trade group, and Sean Collins, a senior director of industry and financial analysis, said last week that their models showed that it would take a 3 percentage point rise in short-term interest rates, affecting every security in a money market fund's portfolio, to drive a fund's value down to 99.5 cents a share.
With short-term rates currently near zero, a jump of 3 percentage points would be such a catastrophic event that money funds might be the least of investors' problems. It's so inconceivable that rates for consumers and businesses could jump that far that fast that it evokes dire images of people in bread lines.
More likely, managers say, is that a downgrade of Treasury bond ratings would push short-term rates up by one-quarter to three-quarters of a point, leaving the net asset value of money funds safely at $1 a share.
Over all, though, fund managers and regulators were optimistic that money market funds would be relatively untouched by further market turmoil.
''We've had a contingency team focused on this since the end of May,'' Robert Brown, president of money markets at Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest manager of money market funds, said Friday. ''We have to be prepared to respond to the unthinkable.''
Fidelity has $440 billion in money market fund assets.
Federal regulators, too, say they believe that investors have seen what is possible -- unlike in 2008, when Lehman Brothers went bankrupt over a weekend.
''I don't believe the Treasury markets are going to freeze up,'' said one federal regulator, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he feared the knowledge that regulators were watching might cause undue concern about a market segment. ''The funds we have talked to are well positioned to substantially handle the kinds of outflows that they have seen recently.''
Money funds must hold only highly rated, short-term assets, but government securities are exempt from the requirement. So a ratings downgrade would not automatically force fund managers to sell Treasuries.
The greater danger is to money funds with extensive holdings of short-term corporate i.o.u.'s, or commercial paper. Any issuer that enjoys a high credit rating because of implicit or explicit support from the government could be subject to downgrades if the government's rating fell.
Those include Fannie Mae, one of the big government mortgage companies, whose debts are guaranteed by Washington but which would likely be downgraded as well, and some of the largest banks, which might enjoy an implicit belief that the government would bail them out in a financial crisis, as it did in 2008.
Regulations after 2008 require taxable money market funds to hold 10 percent of their assets in a form that can be converted to cash in a single day, and all funds to hold 30 percent of assets in a form that can be converted to cash within five days.
According to one market analyst, iMoneyNet, many funds have gone beyond that. On June 30, the company said, the average government money market fund had 58 percent of its assets in securities that would mature within five days.
Even so, the next-to-nothing interest rates that most money market funds are currently earning have been judged by many investors not to be worth the risk. A little-noticed portion of the Dodd-Frank Act, passed in the wake of the financial crisis, provides federal insurance through the end of 2012 for unlimited amounts of deposits in noninterest-bearing checking accounts.
That has led to a sharp upswing in the assets in bank checking accounts, to $2.4 trillion at the end of last year from $2.1 trillion at the end of 2009.
So far, it doesn't seem to have worried investors that the government that is promising to make interest payments on Treasuries is the same government insuring those checking accounts. Insurance on bank accounts is covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

HEADLINE: Deal May Avert Default, but Some Ask if That's Good

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY; Julie Creswell contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The resounding view on Wall Street and among many financial regulators and veteran lawmakers is that there will be a catastrophe if the United States does not raise its debt limit in the next few days.
But will the sky really fall?
It is a question more people were asking as the nation's cash dwindled and lawmakers remained stuck in gridlock before the framework of a settlement emerged late Saturday. President Obama and Congressional leaders were working Sunday to negotiate an 11th-hour deal, and then must hope it can pass in both chambers of Congress this week.
Most people would rather not risk finding out and are hoping lawmakers can turn the framework into a bill that would raise the debt ceiling. But in recent days there has been growing attention on a few economists and financiers who have been arguing that it would be all right to miss the deadline -- and even, a few of them say, default on payments to the nation's bondholders.
These economists and traders argue that lawmakers need to focus on the nation's long-term financial health rather than its current bind. They point to historical examples involving local and national governments that defaulted on some obligations, and said the short-term pain that befell those places when they tried to borrow again eased over time. 
In the case of the United States now, they say such short-term pain would be worth it if it helped lawmakers achieve a sweeping plan to finance the country's future -- including costly programs like Social Security -- without running such a large deficit. A few on the fringe even say the country would be better off if it wiped its hands of some or all of its debt because it might mean future generations of workers will not have to see taxes go up as much as they are otherwise likely to do.
''We have an opportunity now to get ahead of this and we might not in a few years,'' said Christopher Whalen, who writes the Institutional Risk Analyst newsletter. ''If a democracy requires more time, then take more time. I don't think a default is as big a deal as people say it is, because where do investors go?''
Indeed, most investors believe they have few safer places to park cash other than the Treasuries that the United States issues to borrow money. Recently, as lawmakers failed day after day to reach a deal, investors have piled into long-term Treasuries, paying more to purchase them and driving down the United States' borrowing cost. That may be because of weak economic data that has thrust the prospect of stocks into question, but it also underscores the unique status Treasuries hold as a global safe haven and a currency in countless financial transactions each day.
No one really knows what would happen if the United States defaulted on its debt, and a default could come in many forms, including a late payment of interest, a renegotiation of the absolute level of debt or missed payments of some of the government's other obligations, like payments to its vendors. The idea of some sort of default has been tossed around by big names on Wall Street and Washington, including by Stanley Druckenmiller, a private investor who spent many years working with the billionaire George Soros. In May, former president Bill Clinton reportedly said at a panel that ''it might not be calamitous'' if the country defaulted on its debt for a few days.
It is difficult to separate viable proposals from political posturing in the budget debate, and the warnings given on both sides may be exaggerated. There are no historical examples that could be considered directly comparable. Several Republican lawmakers have been urging their peers to take more time on the debt talks, saying doomsday is not imminent. The Obama administration, which months ago announced this Tuesday as the deadline, has vigorously disagreed. Historians still debate what would have happened in 2008 if there had not been a bailout for the banking system. Many in Washington and on Wall Street had argued there would have been a catastrophe back then if the government hadn't intervened.
The question really is whether United States Treasuries, the country's instrument of financial power, is something to be preserved at all costs, as most economists say, or if their status gives the country some leniency in the markets if lawmakers decide to temporarily default, for instance.
Last week, a Pew Research Center survey found that just under one-quarter of Americans believe that lawmakers should not compromise to achieve a quick deal and should instead ''stand by their principles, even if it means the government goes into default.'' The percentage urging a default over a compromise was higher -- 38 percent -- among Republicans.
Still, calls in recent days to economists and financial historians turned up very few who said the country should experiment with default. That is ''disaster talk,'' said John Makin, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute. ''It's just too risky.''
Niall Ferguson, a historian at Harvard, said, ''hey, wait a second, we should not be talking about the United States in the same breath as Argentina and Russia,'' both of which defaulted on their sovereign debt around the turn of the century. He added, ''The very fact that we're doing this is bordering on the surreal.''
Tyler Cowen, an economist at George Mason University, said ''come Sunday at 8 p.m. if it's still a mess, bad things will happen. It will be another run on the shadow banking system like 2008.'' The debt ceiling, he said, must be raised ''any way possible at this point. To avoid catastrophe.''
To all this, Jeff Hummel, one of the economists advocating some of default, says ''too late.''
Mr. Hummel, a professor at San Jose State University, has been predicting since 1993 that the United States will default on its debt. His view is driven by the unfunded liabilities the government has taken on for future benefits, and he says the nation will simply not be able to pay them or finance them all with debt.
He says it would be better to cut bait now.
''If I had my choice, I would repudiate the entire debt and use any available assets to pay Social Security,'' he said.
While acknowledging that his views are ''pretty extreme,'' Mr. Hummel said he thought it was more ethical to focus on providing money to Social Security recipients over the long run. That's because they were forced to put money in, as opposed to parties that bought Treasuries, which are after all, an investment.
In the 1840s, he said, several states like Maryland and Louisiana defaulted and many of them passed state Constitutional procedures related to their debt, blocking them from getting into such debt levels since then. He acknowledges that a default would make it harder for the United States to borrow money, but he doesn't think that's a bad thing. ''You can think of a default as a balanced budget amendment with real teeth,'' he said.
Besides, Mr. Hummel said that in the long run freeing the nation from debt would ''increase the value of human capital,'' because people would not be taxed as much in the future to pay off the debt, so they'd be able to keep more of their earnings.
What's impossible to know of course is how that potential gain would compare to all the economic damages that would come to the nation if the financial markets no longer wanted to lend to the United States.
And it's hard to know how bad it would be right away. Many companies hold their savings in Treasuries and their businesses could grind to a halt if those bonds lost much value. Financial markets that use Treasuries to back trades could freeze. Also many people say the markets are more prone to panics now than in decades past and central banks do not have many more tools to use if we hit another panic so soon after the financial crisis.
Market pundits have already been changing their views on some types of defaults. Whereas many said for weeks that a downgrade of United States bonds by the ratings agencies would be bad, the market has started to accept that as likely and it is not clear that such an outcome would hurt Treasuries.
Standard & Poor's has suggested that the lack of a meaningful plan to cut the deficit could lead it to a downgrade by mid-October. Moody's on Friday said it would give the government even more time to work on a broader budget plan, but it warned that a missed payment on debt would result in a downgrade.
To some degree, even if the government stays current on its debt now, the debt may become worth less over the long run to the investors who hold it because many investors expect the dollar to weaken -- which would lower the value of United States bonds to foreigners. In that sense, the country's financial power may be already fading.
Mr. Druckenmiller, the investor, who did not comment for this article, told The Wall Street Journal in May that Treasury investors would have more confidence in their United States debt holdings if the nation worked out a big-picture solution to its deficit. If doing so takes so long that the country temporarily misses interest payments on its debt -- a technical default -- then so be it, he said.

HEADLINE: Optimism on Wall St. Tempered by Hurdles Ahead

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH; Nelson D. Schwartz, Susanne Craig and Bettina Wassener contributed reporting.

 BODY:
After an anxious weekend spent glued to their BlackBerrys and iPhones, bankers and investors breathed a sigh of relief Sunday as lawmakers forged an agreement to raise the nation's debt ceiling ahead of Monday's trading.
The doomsday discussions that dominated conversations of late quickly faded as political leaders in Washington first signaled a compromise was close, then finally announced a deal on Sunday night.
Wall Street was hesitant to declare total victory, though, because lawmakers still faced the hurdle of getting a bill through both chambers of Congress. 
The optimism was further tempered by the broader economic challenges that continue to confront the United States and global markets.
''The debt ceiling is out of the way, but the current picture is far from rosy,'' said Ajay Rajadhyaksha, head of United States fixed-income and securitized strategy at Barclays Capital. ''Economic growth is so much weaker than many people thought just six months ago, and we are heading into a period of austerity.''
Analysts and investors warned that the markets could remain turbulent in the weeks ahead. Besides sluggish economic growth, the threat of a ratings downgrade on United States debt and Europe's continuing financial troubles loom.
Still, the first signs of market reaction to the deal were positive. Stock markets in Japan and South Korea picked up steam as the deal was announced by President Obama, and they rallied close to 2 percent by midday. Futures contracts on the American stock market also jumped, indicating that Wall Street may recoup some of the past week's losses once trading starts in New York on Monday.
Gold, a traditional haven that struck record highs amid the uncertainty of the past weeks, fell 1 percent to $1,610 an ounce. Oil rose about $1, to $97 a barrel.
In the currencies markets, the dollar gained against the yen and the Swiss franc after falling last week. It was barely changed against the euro.
For Wall Street executives, it was a roller-coaster weekend. Although optimistic that Congress would reach an 11th-hour agreement, bankers had been planning for the worst in case a deal was not struck.
But there was little of the market panic that in the 2008 financial crisis had bankers traders stuck at their desks for much of every weekend. Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley executives were monitoring the news from home.
''Everybody still has the fireman boots and fireman hat on, but there is a significant sigh of relief these guys are moving in the right direction,'' said one senior Wall Street executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity on Sunday afternoon as the deal was coming together.
At JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon huddled with his senior managers at the bank's Park Avenue headquarters. Bank executives also set up a war room at an operations center in Columbus, Ohio, to react to customer issues stemming from the political developments -- just as they did for natural catastrophes like Hurricane Katrina.
By Sunday night when the deal had been announced, lobbyists and financial executives were almost gleeful. ''This is huge,'' said Scott E. Talbott of the Financial Services Roundtable, an industry lobbying group. ''It provides much-needed certainty during an uncertain economic time.''
Mr. Talbott said his group was still reviewing details of the deal, but would likely move forward with a lobbying blitz over the next two days. ''We will light it up with Hill visits, joint-letters, and encourage our member companies to consider contacting members of Congress, too,'' he added.
Indeed, BlackRock, the giant asset manager, issued a statement urging lawmakers to take prompt action. ''Every day of delay in resolving this situation will erode economic confidence, jeopardize job creation and undermine the credibility of the United States in global financial markets,'' it said.
With the deal yet to be approved by lawmakers, Chase announced that it would temporarily waive overdraft fees and other account charges for Social Security recipients, military workers and other federal employees if their government-issued checks were not posted. Last week, the Navy Federal Credit Union pledged that it would advance pay to active military and civilian defense workers in the event of a breach of the debt ceiling.
Investors were hopeful that approval of the deal by Congress would cause the markets to rebound. after tumbling 3.9 percent last week.
''It isn't a 'grand bargain' to cut the deficit -- that would have been great for the market,'' said Byron Wien, the vice chairman of Blackstone Advisory Partners. But he said that the current blueprint, if passed, at least deals with the debt ceiling and that the government's bills will be paid.
''This is a positive, but there was so much negative momentum going into the weekend,'' he added.
Indeed, some investors cautioned that failure to pass the bill would be catastrophic, recalling how the market dropped precipitously in 2008 when Congress initially voted down a huge bailout package for the nation's banks. ''You are looking at Dow 10,000 if this doesn't get resolved in a very short period of time,'' said M. Jake Dollarhide, chief executive of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Okla. That would be a 21 percent drop from where the Dow Jones industrial average closed on Friday.
Even as attention has shifted to the domestic fiscal problems, the European Union financial health continues to deteriorate despite a second bailout package it put in place for Greece last month in an effort to stem its sovereign debt crisis. In one sign of worsening trouble, the spreads on credit-default swaps on the debt of Italy and Spain are nearing their widest level of the year. Investors are betting that those countries are becoming more likely to default on their debts.
Meanwhile, new data released on Friday showed the United States economy had experienced a significant slowdown during the first half of 2011, underscoring the weakness of the recovery. And the political mayhem in Washington has done little to bolster consumer confidence, a crucial economic engine.
Daniel J. Arbess, manager of the Xerion fund at Perella Weinberg Partners in New York, said the fiscal problems in the United States and Europe were ''chronic and will be persisting'' for some time. ''Investors need to get used to them,'' he said. ''No single episode of tension is the ultimate one, nor is any patch the ultimate solution.''

HEADLINE: In World's Eyes, Much Damage to America's Reputation Is Already Done

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With the deal reached Sunday night, the United States has a good chance of escaping the debt limit showdown with its credit rating intact.
The United States government may not be so lucky with its reputation.
Even before negotiations went down to the wire on Sunday night, the bitterness, division and dysfunction that resounded around the world in recent weeks as the United States veered toward default did more than just fuel a perception that Washington is approaching Japan-like levels of political gridlock. Among foreign leaders and in global markets, the political histrionics have eroded America's already diminishing aura as the world's economic haven and the sole country with the power to lead the rest of the world out of financial crisis and recession.
It has chipped away at the global authority of President Obama, who was celebrated abroad when he came to office as a man who would end an era of American unilateralism. Now the topic of discussion in other capitals is whether the Age of Obama is giving way to an Age of Austerity, one that will inevitably reduce America's influence internationally. 
Mr. Obama has all but acknowledged as much in recent weeks, as he paired his decision to withdraw the ''surge'' troops from Afghanistan by next September with a repeat of his declaration that ''it is time to focus on nation building here at home.'' His decision to commit few new American financial resources to supporting the Arab Spring and his insistence that NATO allies must bear the brunt of operations in Libya were deliberate reminders that times have changed, and that America can no longer afford either new Marshall Plans or new wars.
But the brush with default has added a new dimension.
It has left America's creditors and allies alike wondering what had changed in American politics that a significant part of the country's political elite was suddenly willing to risk the nation's reputation as the safest place for the rest of the world to invest.
It raised questions about whether the United States now faces brinkmanship over a variety of issues between an emboldened conservative movement and a president whose authority is under challenge. And for all the talk on the right about ''American exceptionalism,'' especially among members of the Tea Party, it put doubts in the minds of many about whether America's military and economic dominance is something the country is still willing to pay for -- and will always survive.
The new head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, seemed to give voice to that concern when she noted on CNN that in the past there was always ''a positive bias towards the United States of America, towards Treasury bills.'' The events of the past few weeks, she said delicately, are ''probably chipping into that very positive bias.''
Jeffrey Garten, a professor at the Yale School of Management and the author of several books about American power in the era of globalization, said on Sunday that the challenge for the United States will not end with this crisis.
''Even if the deal passes muster with the credit rating agencies, there is still a huge problem,'' he said.
''The problem is that we need both a fiscal strategy and a growth strategy,'' he said. ''And what you hear around the world is that no one is convinced we do -- that we have a pathway to making the debt sustainable and to dealing with everything from our infrastructure to our education system. It seems obvious to everyone that we haven't done anything, but veer around to avoid catastrophe.''
Warnings about American decline are nothing new of course -- they have permeated American politics since Vietnam, save for a brief period in the mid-1990s after the fall of the Soviet Union, when America briefly enjoyed its status as the world's only superpower.
The fears may be premature today as well. With Europe consumed by its own economic crises, from the long-running drama in Greece to new fears about Italy, and with Japan inwardly focused on recovering from the earthquake and tsunami, investors found that there were few other places for the world to go. That helped explain why there has been no real run on the dollar, or on American debt -- there is no place to flee.
''The lucky thing for us is that we are in a race with Europe and Japan for 'most financially irresponsible superpower,' '' Walter Russell Mead, a professor at Bard College and author of many works on the waxing and waning of American power, said on Sunday. ''And right now, the Europeans and Japanese have substantial advantages in that race.''
That leaves China, which emerged the fastest and healthiest from the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, as the only credible alternative on the world scene.
Leaders there have done everything they can to exploit the deadlock in Washington. They have used their official Xinhua news service to criticize the United States for ''dangerously irresponsible'' conduct that risks strangling the fragile economic recovery of not only the United States but the world as a whole. (The statement may sound patronizing, but it echoes criticism the United States issued to Mexico and Asia in the 1990s and to Europe more recently.)
It is all part, of course, of a Chinese campaign to advertise their own economic model as a superior one. But many global investors fear that the Chinese themselves are hardly immune from the kind of pressures that have frozen the Greek Parliament and the United States Congress from confronting underlying problems.
Part of the problem in the debate over the relationship between America's debt and its power is that there are at least two camps -- and the Obama administration (and many Republicans) have a foot in each of them.
One camp repeats versions of the argument put most bluntly by Adm. Mike Mullen, the departing chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who reminds interviewers regularly that ''the most significant threat to our national security is our debt.''
Over time, he fears, cuts in the defense budget could hollow out the military and leave little for the development of a range of new technologies like advanced drones and cyberweapons that are needed for modern-day confrontations.
Traditional hawks in the Republican Party, chief among them Senator John McCain of Arizona, agree with him. Many in the Tea Party -- a more populist bunch who contain a strain of isolationism -- do not, arguing that just as America needs smaller government at home, it needs a smaller military footprint abroad.
There is another argument, though, which has less to do with American hard power than American soft power. Mr. Obama and his secretary of state, Hillary Rodham Clinton, came to office arguing that one way to avoid wildly expensive wars like those of the last decade was to invest in the remaking of failed societies. But a decade after the Sept. 11 attacks, that concept -- that America must invest abroad for its own safety -- is losing support fast. Mr. Obama has made clear that he has no enthusiasm for ''nation building'' projects in Afghanistan that go on for years or are unsustainable. They may be well intentioned, he has told aides, but they are too expensive.
Similarly, many inside the White House and Congress question whether the United States can afford to play its traditional role as the lender and spender of last resort in global financial crises. The idea of putting together a global package to spur the world economy -- as Mr. Obama did just two years ago in London, with European and Chinese help -- seems to be a huge stretch in today's environment of austerity.
As Mr. Garten puts it, ''the lesson of the debt limit crisis is that if there is another financial calamity, we're operating without a safety net. Get used to it.''

HEADLINE: The Diminished President

BYLINE: By ROSS DOUTHAT

 BODY:
By rights, Barack Obama should be emerging as the big political winner in the debt ceiling debate. For months, he's positioned himself near the center of public opinion, leaving Republicans to occupy the rightward flank. Poll after poll suggests that Americans prefer the president's call for a mix of spending cuts and tax increases to the Republican Party's anti-tax approach. Poll after poll shows that House Republicans, not Obama, would take most of the blame if the debt ceiling weren't raised.
Yet the president's approval ratings have been sinking steadily for weeks, hitting a George W. Bush-esque low of 40 percent in a recent Gallup survey. The voters incline toward Obama on the issues, still like him personally and consider the Republican opposition too extreme. But they are increasingly judging his presidency a failure anyway. 
The administration would no doubt blame this judgment on the steady stream of miserable economic news. But it should save some of the blame for its own political approach. Ever since the midterms, the White House's tactics have consistently maximized President Obama's short-term advantage while diminishing his overall authority. Call it the ''too clever by half'' presidency: the administration's maneuvering keeps working out as planned, but Obama's position keeps eroding.
Start with the first round of deficit debates this winter. After the Republican sweep, the White House seemed to have two options: double down on Keynesian stimulus or pivot to the center and champion deficit reduction. Instead, Obama chose to hover above the fray, passing on his own fiscal commission's recommendations and letting the Republicans make the first move.
The strategy worked, in a sense. Goaded by the president's evasiveness, Paul Ryan and the House Republicans put forward a detailed long-term budget proposal of their own, whose Medicare cuts proved predictably unpopular. But while the subsequent policy debate favored Obama, the optics of the confrontation diminished him. The chairman of the House Budget Committee looked more like a leader than the president of the United States.
Then came the spring's great foreign policy dilemma, the civil war in Muammar el-Qaddafi's Libya. The president (wisely) didn't want to put America's blood and treasure on the line for the rebels, but he also didn't want to take responsibility for letting Qaddafi crush the revolt. So the White House opted for a kind of quasi war, throwing just enough military power at the problem to ensure a stalemate and then punting responsibility to our NATO allies. An Obama adviser told The New Yorker's Ryan Lizza that the president was pioneering a new American way of statecraft: ''Leading from behind.''
Again, the strategy worked, sort of. An immediate humanitarian crisis was averted, and Libya quickly fell out of the headlines. But it left Americans to contemplate a peculiar and unpresidential spectacle: The leader of the free world taking the country to war while pretending that he wasn't, and then effectively washing his hands of the ultimate outcome -- which, 135 days and counting later, is still very much in doubt.
The same pattern has played out in the debt ceiling debate. Instead of drawing clear lines and putting forward detailed proposals, the president has played Mr. Compromise -- ceding ground to Republicans here, sermonizing about Tea Party intransigence and Washington gridlock there, and fleshing out his preferred approach reluctantly, if at all.
The White House no doubt figured that this negotiating strategy would either lead to a bipartisan grand bargain or else expose Republican extremism -- or better still, do both. And again, the strategy is arguably working. Americans were given a glimpse of right-wing populism's reckless side last week, and the final deal will probably let the president burnish his centrist credentials just in time for 2012.
But winning a debate on points isn't a substitute for looking like a leader. It's one thing to bemoan politics-as-usual when you're running for the White House. It's quite another to publicly throw up your hands over our ''dysfunctional government'' when you're the man the voters put in charge of it.
In fairness, the president's passive-aggressive approach is a bipartisan affliction. The ostensible front-runner for the Republican nomination, Mitt Romney, took a deliberately hazy position on last week's crucial House debate, preferring to flunk a test of leadership rather than risk alienating either side. (The Washington Examiner's Tim Carney quipped that ''if you took Obama's plan and Romney's plan, and just met in the middle, you'd be in the middle of nowhere.'')
This leaves Americans to contemplate two possibilities more alarming than debt-ceiling brinkmanship. First, that we're living through yet another failed presidency. And second, that there's nobody waiting in the wings who's up to the task either.

HEADLINE: The President Surrenders

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
A deal to raise the federal debt ceiling is in the works. If it goes through, many commentators will declare that disaster was avoided. But they will be wrong.
For the deal itself, given the available information, is a disaster, and not just for President Obama and his party. It will damage an already depressed economy; it will probably make America's long-run deficit problem worse, not better; and most important, by demonstrating that raw extortion works and carries no political cost, it will take America a long way down the road to banana-republic status.
Start with the economics. We currently have a deeply depressed economy. We will almost certainly continue to have a depressed economy all through next year. And we will probably have a depressed economy through 2013 as well, if not beyond. 
The worst thing you can do in these circumstances is slash government spending, since that will depress the economy even further. Pay no attention to those who invoke the confidence fairy, claiming that tough action on the budget will reassure businesses and consumers, leading them to spend more. It doesn't work that way, a fact confirmed by many studies of the historical record.
Indeed, slashing spending while the economy is depressed won't even help the budget situation much, and might well make it worse. On one side, interest rates on federal borrowing are currently very low, so spending cuts now will do little to reduce future interest costs. On the other side, making the economy weaker now will also hurt its long-run prospects, which will in turn reduce future revenue. So those demanding spending cuts now are like medieval doctors who treated the sick by bleeding them, and thereby made them even sicker.
And then there are the reported terms of the deal, which amount to an abject surrender on the part of the president. First, there will be big spending cuts, with no increase in revenue. Then a panel will make recommendations for further deficit reduction -- and if these recommendations aren't accepted, there will be more spending cuts.
Republicans will supposedly have an incentive to make concessions the next time around, because defense spending will be among the areas cut. But the G.O.P. has just demonstrated its willingness to risk financial collapse unless it gets everything its most extreme members want. Why expect it to be more reasonable in the next round?
In fact, Republicans will surely be emboldened by the way Mr. Obama keeps folding in the face of their threats. He surrendered last December, extending all the Bush tax cuts; he surrendered in the spring when they threatened to shut down the government; and he has now surrendered on a grand scale to raw extortion over the debt ceiling. Maybe it's just me, but I see a pattern here.
Did the president have any alternative this time around? Yes.
First of all, he could and should have demanded an increase in the debt ceiling back in December. When asked why he didn't, he replied that he was sure that Republicans would act responsibly. Great call.
And even now, the Obama administration could have resorted to legal maneuvering to sidestep the debt ceiling, using any of several options. In ordinary circumstances, this might have been an extreme step. But faced with the reality of what is happening, namely raw extortion on the part of a party that, after all, only controls one house of Congress, it would have been totally justifiable.
At the very least, Mr. Obama could have used the possibility of a legal end run to strengthen his bargaining position. Instead, however, he ruled all such options out from the beginning.
But wouldn't taking a tough stance have worried markets? Probably not. In fact, if I were an investor I would be reassured, not dismayed, by a demonstration that the president is willing and able to stand up to blackmail on the part of right-wing extremists. Instead, he has chosen to demonstrate the opposite.
Make no mistake about it, what we're witnessing here is a catastrophe on multiple levels.
It is, of course, a political catastrophe for Democrats, who just a few weeks ago seemed to have Republicans on the run over their plan to dismantle Medicare; now Mr. Obama has thrown all that away. And the damage isn't over: there will be more choke points where Republicans can threaten to create a crisis unless the president surrenders, and they can now act with the confident expectation that he will.
In the long run, however, Democrats won't be the only losers. What Republicans have just gotten away with calls our whole system of government into question. After all, how can American democracy work if whichever party is most prepared to be ruthless, to threaten the nation's economic security, gets to dictate policy? And the answer is, maybe it can't.

HEADLINE: Charging a Premium, at a Cost

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY

 BODY:
SANTA MONICA, Calif. -- Would you go to the movies more if tickets cost less?
''Yes, absolutely,'' said Sarah Galvin. ''We go twice a month, we'd go every single weekend.''
Ms. Galvin had shown up to see ''Captain America: The First Avenger,'' in 3-D, at the AMC Santa Monica 7 theater here on Wednesday.
She had a little one in tow, in superhero costume. Adult tickets were $15.75, children's, $12.75. ''It costs so much,'' Ms. Galvin said.
After years of grumbling about steadily rising ticket prices, consumers achieved the nearly unthinkable earlier this year: they forced a momentary drop in the average cost of a movie ticket, to $7.86 in the first quarter, down from $8.01 in the fourth quarter of last year, partly by opting out of costly 3-D tickets for movies like ''Mars Needs Moms,'' and watching films in cheaper 2-D. 
But prices started rising again this summer. In a conference call with investors on Thursday, executives of the Regal Entertainment Group, the nation's largest theater chain, predicted the usual average price increase of 3 percent or more across the industry by year's end.
If so, it will be the 17th consecutive annual increase in a business whose prices have outpaced the effect of general inflation by more than half since 1999. Theater attendance has fallen by about 10 percent in that period, or even more when measured as a share of the growing population.
Executives from Hollywood's major studios are generally reluctant to discuss prices. But with domestic box office down 5.55 percent -- to $6.42 billion from $6.80 billion -- from last year at this time, according to Hollywood.com, even some of the best-compensated players are beginning to wonder whether exhibitors and studios are pushing their luck with consumers.
At the Comic-Con International fantasy convention in San Diego last month, Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson, two of Hollywood's most prominent directors, voiced a strong hope that ticket prices for 3-D films would ultimately fall into line with the lower charge for 2-D movies. Consumers are being charged an extra $5 to see a movie only to find out it is ''as bad as the one you saw in 2-D,'' Mr. Jackson said.
Their plea brought a sharp response last week from Jeffrey Katzenberg, the DreamWorks Animation chief executive, who has been an advocate of 3-D and the increased price that comes with it.
''They're not getting complaints at the box office about pricing, it's just not happening,'' said Mr. Katzenberg, who spoke by telephone on Thursday. Mr. Katzenberg said his own company's recent experience with ''Kung Fu Panda 2,'' which took in about 45 percent of $161 million in domestic ticket sales from the higher priced 3-D tickets, showed that a substantial number of consumers would still pay a premium for good films.
''Whatever Peter and Steven are talking to, maybe they're following their instincts,'' Mr. Katzenberg said of the Spielberg-Jackson pricing critique. ''But there's actually no factual data.''
Asked whether 3-D pricing had been too aggressive, David Passman, the chief executive of Carmike Cinemas, said by e-mail: ''Perhaps in some markets, but generally, no.''
Historically, the big theater chains like Regal, AMC Entertainment, Cinemark Theatres and Carmike or their predecessors have been reluctant to raise ticket prices because their profit margins were higher on the sale of popcorn and other concessions than from tickets. Thus, they had an interest in raising the number of attendees, rather than maximizing film revenue that would be shared with studios. (The studios and exhibitors typically split the proceeds from each ticket sale, although the exhibitors alone set the price to consumers.) Patrick Corcoran, the director of media and research for the National Association of Theatre Owners, points out that a ticket purchased for the average price of $1.65 in 1971 would cost $9.20 today -- higher than the actual industry average, if adjusted according to the general inflation rate.
More recently, though, theater chains turned to price increases, and especially to premium prices for 3-D and big-screen formats like Imax, for added cash that sometimes has been used to pay large dividends to shareholders or to pay down debt.
Cinemark Holdings, though generally more restrained than some of its peers when it comes to pricing, raised its quarterly dividend 17 percent, to 21 cents a share from 18 cents, an amount that nearly equaled its earnings in the first quarter. Meanwhile, Carmike, which operates many small-town theaters with relatively low ticket prices, has paid down a substantial $100 million in debt in just over three years.
Regal, of which Philip Anschutz is a major shareholder, has an average ticket price of about $8.75, nearly 9 percent higher than the industry average of $8.06. And, like Cinemark, it recently raised its quarterly dividend to 21 cents from 18 cents, after declaring a special dividend of $1.40 a share, or $216 million, in December.
Speaking privately to avoid conflict with their business partners, some studio executives contend that such payouts are draining the chains of money that could be used to upgrade or replace theaters that are charging higher prices but offering a less-than-premium experience, beyond the investment in the digital projectors required for 3-D.
Theater owners say otherwise. ''The dividend payments were not at the expense of reinvestment,'' Amy E. Miles, Regal's chief executive, said in an e-mail on Friday. Movie-going remains relatively inexpensive, and two-thirds of Regal's customers continue to pay $10 or less for a ticket, Ms. Miles added.
Mr. Corcoran said the theater owners association did not compile publicly available statistics on the average surcharge for 3-D tickets. But the average add-on appears to be about $3, rather than the $5 sometimes seen at big-city theaters. Of a $3 surcharge, the theater owner and the studio would each receive about $1.50, but each would typically pay about 50 cents to a technology provider like RealD -- the theater owner for licensing, the studio for glasses.
From its share, the studio must cover the incremental cost of making a 3-D film, while the theater owner's remaining stake moves more directly to the bottom line, since technology firms like RealD cover the cost of maintaining their equipment.
The industrywide average ticket price -- which factors in low-price small-town theaters, second-run houses and discount sales through outlets like Costco -- can appear impossibly low to urban dwellers, who are accustomed to paying far more at theaters in cities like Los Angeles, Chicago and New York, where real estate is expensive and zoning laws can require, for instance, a lobby as large as the auditorium, to avoid lines on the street.
In some markets, too, pricing changes have caused surprising distortions. In Santa Monica, for instance, the price of a regular adult ticket at AMC Loews Broadway 4 theater, also owned by AMC, has risen by 47 percent since 2001, to $11.75 from $8 -- only a little more than the 41 percent increase in the average ticket price for the same years. But children's tickets rose 67 percent for the period, to $8.75 from $5.25, while senior tickets are up 95 percent, to $10.75 from $5.50. Add 3-D, and a child's ticket goes to $12.75, while a senior pays $14.75, two to three times the cost of a ticket 10 years ago.
At AMC, whose average price tops the industry average, the added cash contributed since December to $263.1 million in dividends, which the privately held firm's parent used to pay down debt, according to a recent company filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. AMC executives declined to be interviewed, citing restrictions on their ability to speak publicly pending a planned stock offering.
Plans for new theater construction in Santa Monica have been held back by a regulatory review and the need to resolve zoning issues.
Though generally well tended, the Santa Monica 7 theater is showing its age. Here and there, the wallpaper is cracked or a piece of trim is missing, and the basement level, where ''Captain America'' was showing on Wednesday in a large 3-D auditorium, had a distinctly musty smell.
As for Ms. Galvin, she just wished the tickets were a little cheaper.
''I'd bring my husband,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Leaders Agree On Outlines Of Deal To End Debt Crisis

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE and HELENE COOPER; Robert Pear and Jackie Calmes contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama and Congressional leaders of both parties said late Sunday that they had agreed to a framework for a budget deal that would cut trillions of dollars in federal spending over the next decade and clear the way for an increase in the government's borrowing limit.
With the health of the fragile economy hanging in the balance and financial markets watching closely, the leaders said they would present the compromise to their caucuses on Monday in hopes of enacting it before a Tuesday deadline to avert default.
Even as the president was speaking from the White House on Sunday night, Speaker John A. Boehner was on a conference call with House Republicans, trying to sell them on the proposal he had signed off on only minutes before. 
Since he is likely to lose the most conservative elements of his rank and file, Mr. Boehner faces the task of framing the pact as friendly enough to Republican principles to win over a significant group of House Republicans without alienating Democrats he will need to push it over the top.
President Obama, in a hastily called appearance with reporters that ended a day of uncertainty, said that the compromise would ''allow us to avoid default and end the crisis that Washington imposed on the rest of America.''
''It ensures also that we will not face this same kind of crisis again in six months, or eight months, or 12 months,'' he said. ''And it will begin to lift the cloud of debt and the cloud of uncertainty that hangs over our economy.''
Just before Mr. Obama spoke on television, the two Senate leaders, Harry Reid and Mitch McConnell, took the floor to endorse the pact as well.
''I am relieved to say that leaders from both parties have come together for the sake of our economy to reach a historic, bipartisan compromise that ends this dangerous standoff,'' said Mr. Reid, the majority leader.
The tentative agreement calls for at least $2.4 trillion in spending cuts over 10 years, a new Congressional committee to recommend a deficit-reduction proposal by Thanksgiving, and a two-step increase in the debt ceiling.
The announcement concluded a tumultuous 24 hours that saw hopes rise Saturday night over the prospect of a deal that might have concluded the budget stalemate. By Sunday, worry set in again as lawmakers and White House officials struggled to hammer out the fine points of an agreement that must clear a Senate controlled by Democrats as well as the Republican House.
If the deal is approved, establishing a special joint committee to explore deficit reduction, it will ensure that the size and scope of the federal government and the tension between spending and taxes will remain front and center in the Washington debate headed into the 2012 election.
Markets reacted favorably to the announcement, with Asian markets jumping on news of the deal. The Nikkei was up nearly 2 percent in late-morning trading; the dollar rose against the Japanese yen.
President Obama tempered his comments by noting that ''there are still some very important votes to be taken'' and that winning House approval would be a particular challenge.
On the conference call, Mr. Boehner sought to portray the new agreement as one heavily tilted toward the Republican call for no new revenue, and he said it met the goal of instituting cuts greater than the amount of the debt limit increase. In a presentation, he said the pact would prevent a ''job-killing default'' -- a warning to lawmakers that failure to raise the limit could add to the bleak employment picture.
''Our framework is now on the table that will end this crisis in a manner that meets our principles of smaller government,'' said Mr. Boehner, who said he hoped to get the legislation onto the House floor as quickly as possible. Participants on the call, which lasted about an hour, said that the tone was cordial and that lawmakers expressed less resistance than had been anticipated.
At the same time, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the former speaker and current Democratic leader, was noncommittal about the plan, suggesting that Democrats might not rally behind it. ''I look forward to reviewing the legislation with my caucus to see what level of support we can provide,'' she said in a written statement.
Senior White House officials said they were hopeful that Congressional leaders from both sides would manage to sell the deal to their parties. While ''there are some Democrats who simply don't believe in the necessity of deficit reduction,'' one administration official said, ''most do. I think it's important as a party to show Americans that we're serious about deficit reduction.''
The Senate seemed an easier sell. Senator Mike Johanns, Republican of Nebraska, said that from the terms of the deal described to him, ''I think I will be satisfied and supportive.'' After years of work, he noted, Congress has become ''serious about cuts in spending.''
As conversations flowed between the White House and Capitol Hill early Sunday, Mr. Reid publicly embraced the compromise that would tie deep spending cuts to a debt ceiling increase even though some Democrats believed the White House has given too much ground to Mr. McConnell and Mr. Boehner.
While lawmakers awaited word of an agreement, talks dragged on. Congressional and administration officials attributed the delay to efforts by Mr. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, to limit immediate reductions in the Pentagon budget and better protect it from future cuts in order to cement votes from defense hawks. He needs those votes to win approval of the plan in the House.
Officials said that Mr. Boehner ultimately did not gain much and that the dispute was settled through an agreement to expand the definition of ''security-related'' spending to include departments beyond the Pentagon, spreading out potential cuts to the Department of Homeland Security and other agencies.
The tense, last-minute negotiations were taking place against a backdrop of uncertainty, with a looming threat of a costly downgrade of the nation's credit rating and with investors worried about the global economic impact of a possible default. The political stakes were unusually high as well, with leaders in both parties staking out positions that may well be central to their re-election chances in 2012. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was on the phone all weekend with Republican leaders of the House and Senate.
Referring to the torturous negotiations, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, said: ''Sausage making is not pretty. But the sausage we have, I think, is a very different sausage from when we started.''
But not everyone was pleased. ''It may be the best we can do,'' said Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the senior Republican on the Budget Committee. ''But I do not think it's enough.''
With the talks appearing to make progress, the Senate blocked a Democratic proposal for a debt limit increase on a vote of 50-49, falling 10 votes short of the 60 required to limit debate. The plan that ultimately won the support of Congressional leaders was described by officials briefed on its outline. They said the debt limit would be increased by $900 billion in the first installment, subject to a Congressional vote of disapproval that Mr. Obama would be able to veto. To prevent a default, $400 billion would be added immediately.
A second increase of $1.2 trillion to $1.5 trillion would be available subject to a second vote of disapproval by Congress. At the same time, a new joint Congressional committee would be created to find cuts roughly matching the increase in the debt limit.
If the evenly divided committee failed to agree on a plan, Congress would either have to approve a balanced budget agreement to the Constitution or accept an across-the-board cut in spending in line with the committee's goal, with 50 percent of the savings coming from the Pentagon beginning in 2013. Medicare would also sustain cuts, though the reductions would be capped; Social Security and other programs would be exempt.
The rationale for picking favored programs like the Pentagon for Republicans and Medicare for Democrats was to provide a strong incentive for the new committee to avoid a deadlock and deliver a deficit reduction plan that could clear Congress.
Online Correction: July 31, 2011, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated when the automatic cuts would occur if Congress does not approve a second round in a few months. They would occur at the end of the year 2012, not 2011.

HEADLINE: HSBC to Cut 25,000 More Jobs

BYLINE: JULIA WERDIGIER


HIGHLIGHT: HSBC, the biggest European bank, said Monday that it would cut 25,000 jobs in the next two years as part of a wide-ranging cost reduction program.

 BODY:
HSBC, the biggest European bank, said Monday that it would cut 25,000 jobs in the next two years as part of a wide-ranging cost reduction program.
The cuts would come in addition to 5,000 positions the bank already eliminated this year by closing or selling some businesses. Shares of the British banking company rose 3.2 percent in London after the bank reported better than expected first-half profit.
HSBC said Monday that profit rose 36 percent to $9.2 billion in the first six months of this year from $6.7 billion in the same period last year. HSBC had to set aside $5.3 billion for bad loans and other credit risks, 30 percent less than in the first half of last year. 
Stuart T. Gulliver, who took over as HSBC's chief executive in January, said he was "pleased with these results, which mark a first step in the right direction on what will be a long journey."
Mr. Gulliver said in May that he plans to cut costs by between $2.5 billion and $3.5 billion in the next two to three years. As part of the plan, HSBC announced Sunday that it would sell 195 of its branches in upstate New York to the First Niagara Financial Group for about $1 billion. The branches being sold hold about $15 billion in deposits.
HSBC already closed its retail banking operation in Russia and Poland and sold three insurance businesses. Scaling back some operations in Latin America, Britain, the Unites States, France and the Middle East resulted in 5,000 job cuts so far this year, HSBC said Monday. 
Mr. Gulliver said he expects the economic outlook for Asia and other emerging markets to "remain positive." 
"Growth in the U.S. and Europe is likely to remain sluggish as long as the impact of high debt levels and government budget cuts weigh on economic activity," he said.
Higher profits at its commercial and retail banking operations and its wealth management unit more than compensated for a decline in profits at its investment banking unit. Pretax profit rose 3 percent to $11.5 billion in the first half from $11.1 billion in the period last year while earnings at its investment banking unit fell to $4.8 billion from $5.4 billion.

HEADLINE: Visiting Artists | Luke Gilford

BYLINE: JOHNNY MISHEFF


HIGHLIGHT: The multi-hyphenate on his roots, on his latest documentary and on being digital and analog.

 BODY:
Luke Gilford is a photographer, a filmmaker, a collagist and installation artist - and the list doesn't stop there. And yet he manages to wear all those hats while homing in on a distinct visual language. Gilford is equally at ease orchestrating large groups of people, say, directing videos for Casey Spooner or Blaqstarr, as he is working solo. He is simultaneously digital and analog: he can be found fiddling around on the computer - editing, retouching, sound mixing - then spend the next 10 hours sitting cross-legged on the floor of his bedroom cutting, gluing, finger painting, scanning, printing, depending on what the projects (and his mind) calls for. Every project, every move, even the idea to get improvisational, it seems, gets triple consideration. The final product emerges effortlessly, and is always lovely to look at.
Name: Luke Gilford
Place of origin: I went to high school in San Ramon, Calif. My parents moved to Santa Cruz a few years ago, though. I feel like I "grew up" in both places.
Current location: Los Angeles.
Medium: I've always liked working with images and videos. I was initially drawn to them because they're so economical, at least in terms of communicating ideas. I like images and videos that are emotional but not necessarily personal. Mediums aren't something I talk about very much, though. I like talking about ideas.
Current project: Right now I'm putting together a documentary in India and a film about beauty pageants, plus a few different music videos.With my personal work, I just wrapped up a museum show in Amsterdam (FOAM). I'm also getting ready to start a few new collaborations that I'm really excited about. All of these projects are a hodgepodge collage of art and film and family and friends. I don't think I know how to separate my work from my life, but I'm not scared of that.
Motto: I was a competitive swimmer until college, so sports slogans like "attitude is everything" and "just do it" are embedded into my psyche - for better or worse. And Santa Cruz is known as a pretty "new age" place, so some of those ideas definitely rubbed off on me. I have a few personal mantras about energy and positivity, but I think it's important to keep those personal.
Best thing you've seen lately - not your own: All of the living past winners of Miss America, together in the lobby of a Las Vegas casino. I think witnessing these kinds of occasions is more inspiring than most gallery or museum shows. If I were to decide though, My Barbarian's recent "Death Panel Discussion" at the Hammer Museum was brilliant. It was entertaining and subversive. I love things that can be both.
Hidden talents: When I lived in New York, I worked as a private investigator. I discovered that I could do all kinds of things I never knew possible.I'm pretty good at sleeping with my eyes open too.

HEADLINE: The Federal Debt: When Compound Interest Is Crushing

BYLINE: CARL RICHARDS


HIGHLIGHT: A spike in interest rates that the United States government pays would show how compound interest can be crushing.

 BODY:
The showdown over increasing the federal debt limit got me thinking about the power of compound interest. It's always been one of the most powerful forces in the financial universe. And in the case of the debt ceiling, it appears that compound interest has the potential to become a crushing enemy.
Some people fear that the United States will lose its AAA credit-rating or even default temporarily, potentially increasing how much it costs the government to borrow money. According to the Congressional Budget Office:
...a 4-percentage-point across-the-board increase in interest rates would raise federal interest payments next year by about $100 billion; if those higher rates persisted, net interest costs in 2015 would be nearly double the roughly $460 billion that the C.B.O. currently projects for that year.
Think about that for a minute. If those worst-case-scenario interest rates came to pass and persisted, we'd be approaching a trillion dollars in interest payments per year. That's what compound interest looks like when it's working against you.
On a personal scale, you get a taste of it every month if you get careless with credit cards. Take a look at a bill. For every month you carry a balance, there's a minimum payment required.
Many people only pay the minimum, not realizing that compound interest could make that $3,000 television cost way more than that and take over a decade to pay off. And that assumes you don't add any additional charges to the balance.
New rules require that credit card companies include a section on each statement that shows just how long it will take to pay off the balance if you only make the minimum payment. Do yourself a favor and pay attention to the numbers. What you owe will only compound over time, and paying the minimum just digs the hole that much faster.
J. Reuben Clark, an undersecretary of state for President Coolidge, noted a long time ago that, interest on debt "never sleeps nor sickens nor dies... Once in debt, interest is your companion every minute of the day and night; you cannot shun it or slip away from it; you cannot dismiss it; it yields neither to entreaties, demands, or orders; and whenever you get in its way or cross its course or fail to meet its demands, it crushes you."
It also gets in the way of achieving our goals. Last week, one reader commented that having a zero balance on your credit card was almost as good as saving money. There is some truth to that because every dollar we spend on interest is one less dollar that can be saved for the future.
Now it becomes a question of how to make compound interest work for you instead of working against you.
Next week we'll talk about the power of compound interest and the end of a long period of savings. In the meantime, what have you done to protect yourself from getting crushed by interest?

HIGHLIGHT: Bad all around.

 BODY:
Bad news all over. In the US, Manufacturing growth hits lowest level in 2 years. In Europe, my favorite current indicator of the eurozone crisis, the Italy-Germany bond spread, has blown out again. And while part of this is due to falling German rates -- which, like falling US rates, reflect growing pessimism about growth -- the Italian bond rate is once again at 6 percent, a level that invites a self-fulfilling debt spiral.
Oh, and in Britain, poster child for wonderful expansionary austerity, we have this:
For the fifth consecutive month, the manufacturing sector has disappointed expectations. In the past six months, the headline composite index has crashed by 12.5 points, a record only exceeded post-Lehman in 2008. Output has been slightly better behaved over the past few months, but July's 2 point decline to 50.6 leaves it slightly below May's trough. Worryingly, the temporary supply-chain disruptions that depressed output in May appear to have eased, indicating that July's weakness might be more structural
I'm so glad we have a deal that will bring the confidence fairy to our rescue!

HEADLINE: This Week in Small Business: Lessons in Negotiating

BYLINE: GENE MARKS


HIGHLIGHT: Plus: Are you taking care of yourself?

 BODY:
What's affecting me, my clients and other small-business owners this week.
The Deficit: Lessons in Negotiating
A debt ceiling deal seems close, but a report says we could avoid default a few days longer. Budget cuts may close 3,652 post offices but Mark Hendricks asks whether it would matter to your business if the postman left town. While the Chinese, Japanese and plenty of other foreigners own substantial amounts, it's really Americans who hold most of America's debt - and the United States issues 59 percent of the world's AAA sovereign debt! Research ties the size of our government to the size of our people. Once the debt crisis is over, we can look forward to another government shutdown fight. This pastor appreciates the finer things in life. Everyone asks why you can't run the government like a business; Fred Paul wonders what it would be like if you had to run your business like the government. Mitchell York says the debt-ceiling talks reveal three important lessons in negotiating for entrepreneurs.
The Data: Are Consumers Crazy?
Gross domestic product numbers show a sputtering economy. New home sales fall more than expected. Home prices are bouncing along the bottom. Mortgage applications are at their lowest since February. A real estate investor explains that we are 40,000 properties away from recovery. Orders for durable goods (pdf) decline. The price of electric cars goes up. Gas prices go up. But for some products, prices have been falling. Truck tonnage jumped in June. Consumer confidence (pdf) rose (what are consumers thinking?!!!). Manufacturing production in Texas improved. And this chart from Russell Investments shows that most economic indicators are still within the norm. A recent review of job vacancy postings found that employers would prefer to hire only people who are currently employed or recently laid off.
The Economy: The Current Malaise
Respondents to the Kauffman Foundation's third-quarter survey expect weak employment growth and higher annual deficits (pdf) ahead. David Leonhardt explains the current malaise.

Some women may plot a different strategy for success.
Around the States: Spanish in the West, Chinese in the East
Texas added the most jobs of any state this year. Michigan businesses are more upbeat about the economy. The Los Angeles Times's Spanish-language newspaper hosts free financial seminars for small-business owners.

Government keeps growing in 35 states.
Around the World: A Couple of Brits Explore Wal-Mart
Despite American politicians' pro-small-business rhetoric, the United States lags far behind most developed countries in the share of citizens employed by small businesses. A couple of Brits explore Wal-Mart. For the first time ever, developing countries as a group have been growing faster than industrial countries. A South African entrepreneur demonstrates how business and faith can work together. Check your TV listings for "The Office" Afghanistan-style. India moves closer to allowing foreign firms into retail.
Finance: Big Retailers Are Lending Small Businesses Money
Steve King and Carolyn Ockels wonder if Office Depot, Google and Wal-Mart are disrupting small-business lending: "The customers targeted by Wal-Mart, Office Depot, Google and others are very small businesses, most with less than $1 million in revenue - a segment seen as unattractive by many financial institutions. But by ignoring this segment, financial institutions are providing an entry point for new competitors who may leverage this beachhead to become significant players in the financial services industry." The Small Business Administration unveils a new venture capital fund. If you are a bank and still haven't repaid government bailout money, Uncle Sam has a deal for you.
Technology: Billions of Smartphones
Mashable provides an infographic of Web and business tools that start-ups use most. According to a recent Hewlett-Packard survey 93 percent of companies have placed cost concerns over the best information technology solutions, leading 89 percent of those companies to experience I.T.-related problems. T.J. McCue lists eight top online backup services for small businesses. Annual smartphone sales could reach a billion by 2016. Inc. magazine suggests the best software for the front office. Jason Hiner says the future of I.T. will be reduced to three kinds of jobs. Rob Enderle suggests the best tablet for business. Google releases a cluster of improvements to its Docs and Sites and buys a facial recognition start-up. Tech Republic offers a free download of Google keyboard shortcuts. But Roger McNamee says, "Google is done." Bob Cringely predicts "the fading of the entire social media category."
The Week Ahead
How productive were we in July? We'll get an answer from the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing and non-manufacturing indexes, as well as from factory orders. We'll also see how much consumers are earning and spending, particularly on cars. On Friday comes the big number: July's unemployment rate.
This Week's Bests
Marketing Tips for Start-Ups Brad McCarty offers 10 marketing tips for every start-up, including "Avoid Cliches Like The Plague: pivot, ground-breaking, magical, synergy these are words that make me delete a press release on sight and you would be best served by avoiding them entirely. Even if you have pivoted into a ground-breaking photo-sharing application that uses synergistic analytics to seem magical, you should find another way to say it."
Thoughts on Technology Nicholas Carr struggles with the benefits of technology: "You could argue that technology has improved life on earth because a lower percentage of people exist in a state of physical suffering today than used to. But one of the most important effects of technology has been to allow for an enormous increase in human population. And if you look at raw numbers, you might well find that more individuals exist in a state of physical suffering than did before."
Small-Business Lesson From Amy Winehouse Tricia Fox says that Amy Winehouse's untimely death is a wake-up call for small-business owners.

HEADLINE: This Week in Small Business: Lessons in Negotiating

BYLINE: GENE MARKS


HIGHLIGHT: Plus: Are you taking care of yourself?

 BODY:
What's affecting me, my clients and other small-business owners this week.
The Deficit: Lessons in Negotiating
A debt ceiling deal seems close, but a report says we could avoid default a few days longer. Budget cuts may close 3,652 post offices but Mark Hendricks asks whether it would matter to your business if the postman left town. While the Chinese, Japanese and plenty of other foreigners own substantial amounts, it's really Americans who hold most of America's debt - and the United States issues 59 percent of the world's AAA sovereign debt! Research ties the size of our government to the size of our people. Once the debt crisis is over, we can look forward to another government shutdown fight. This pastor appreciates the finer things in life. Everyone asks why you can't run the government like a business; Fred Paul wonders what it would be like if you had to run your business like the government. Mitchell York says the debt-ceiling talks reveal three important lessons in negotiating for entrepreneurs.
The Data: Are Consumers Crazy?
Gross domestic product numbers show a sputtering economy. New home sales fall more than expected. Home prices are bouncing along the bottom. Mortgage applications are at their lowest since February. A real estate investor explains that we are 40,000 properties away from recovery. Orders for durable goods (pdf) decline. The price of electric cars goes up. Gas prices go up. But for some products, prices have been falling. Truck tonnage jumped in June. Consumer confidence (pdf) rose (what are consumers thinking?!!!). Manufacturing production in Texas improved. And this chart from Russell Investments shows that most economic indicators are still within the norm. A recent review of job vacancy postings found that employers would prefer to hire only people who are currently employed or recently laid off.
The Economy: The Current Malaise
Respondents to the Kauffman Foundation's third-quarter survey expect weak employment growth and higher annual deficits (pdf) ahead. David Leonhardt explains the current malaise. Rasmussen finds that 47 percent of Americans are eating out less often than six months ago. Maybe that's because the price of dinner foods are up almost 5 percent. This I know: no one's going to buy the world's most expensive hot dog. Amazon's sales soar. Expedia breaks a billion. Research In Motion is having problems.

HEADLINE: Bares, not Bulls, on Wall Street

BYLINE: MELENA RYZIK


HIGHLIGHT: An art work leads to three arrests.

 BODY:
Three people were detained by the police shortly after 7 a.m. Monday when they briefly appeared in various stages of undress in front of the New York Stock Exchange on Wall Street. The people, two men and one woman, were taking part in a work of site-specific performance art, "Ocularpation Wall Street," which called for them to get naked for about five minutes. The piece, created by an artist, Zefrey Throwell, involved 50 people impersonating the various occupations of Wall Street - traders and secretaries, janitors and coffee fetchers - and play-acting their roles briefly before stripping down along the length of the street. The idea, Mr. Throwell said, was to expose the realities of working on the nation's financial artery as a commentary on the state of the economy, though most passer-by simply saw flesh. "He's buck naked! Lord have mercy!" one woman said, as she watched a man doff his suit near the entrance to the Wall Street stop of the 2/3 subway line. The detained people were dressed as a dog walker, a janitor and a stock broker. They were taken to a nearby precinct for investigation, a police captain on Wall Street said. Mr. Throwell, who was not arrested, followed. A fuller article about this event will appear later on Monday.

HEADLINE: Could This Deal Raise Budget Deficits?

BYLINE: FLOYD NORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: If budget cuts wind up slowing down the economy, tax receipts may fall in turn.

 BODY:
It is virtually impossible to think of the impact of the debt deal as doing anything to help the economy. But give Mr. Kroszner credit for trying, in today's front-page article by Binyamin Appelbaum and Catherine Rampell.
To come up with a rosy scenario, he suggests that uncertainty may somehow be reduced, leading to more consumption and investment. I cannot imagine anyone actually thinking this deal -- with its clear potential for another bruising fight and deadlock that will do more to hurt the economy -- decreases uncertainty.
In fact, this deal could manage to do the exact opposite of what it promises -- raise the deficit.
If that happens, it will be because a major determinant of tax revenue is the health of the economy. Profits and growth bring revenues. This could damage the economy enough to send tax receipts down again. Although you never would have guessed it from the rhetoric, tax receipts are at the lowest level in years, as a percentage of gross domestic product. Get a healthy economy and tax revenues rise while a lot of spending, on such things as unemployment benefits, goes away.
What this has shown is that the Republican Congressional leadership is terrified of the Tea Party and of people like Sarah Palin, who hinted she would support a primary challenge to any Republican who voted to raise the debt ceiling. The leadership knew that not raising the ceiling was unthinkable, but many of the members did not.
The next showdown -- assuming Congress passes the deal on Monday -- will come directly after the 2012 election, but with the current Congress. So even if these people are thrown out, they have assured themselves one last chance to be totally irresponsible. Then, when the new Congress tries to undo the damage, the ones who are still there can filibuster.
What has been proved by this is that there are a substantial number of members of Congress who basically are opposed to the government and welcome anything that would keep it from functioning. If the Republican leadership again grants them veto power over anything, some of them will think that forcing huge spending cuts at the end of 2012 will have been a triumph, no matter what it does to the economy or to Americans less well off than themselves.
If Mr. Kroszner's rosy scenario seems unreal, there might still be one. It relies on the fact that fiscal and monetary stimulus work with lags. When recoveries really get going, they can become self-sustaining quickly.
The normal course after recessions before the 1990s was for complaints that nothing was happening to turn overnight to amazement about how fast recovery is taking hold, and then to be followed by complaints that the last round of stimulus was unnecessary.
Is it possible that we have reached an inflection point, and that despite the weak economic numbers there is really no need for more stimulus?
Yes, it is.
Is it likely?
Not so much.
What is clear is that the lessons of the 1930s -- that you don't deal with weakness by cutting back -- have been forgotten or were never learned.

HEADLINE: Help Wanted Ads Bode Ill for Jobs

BYLINE: MOTOKO RICH


HIGHLIGHT: A survey shows that vacancies advertised in Internet job listings fell by 217,000 in July.

 BODY:
If the debt deal passes on Monday in time to avert a federal default, all eyes will turn to the July jobs report coming Friday from the Labor Department. The last report, as you remember, was dismal: employers added just 18,000 net nonfarm payroll jobs in June.
Signals are not looking good. A key survey of manufacturers showed that employment in July grew at a slower rate than in June. And the Conference Board, a business group, released a survey showing that vacancies advertised in Internet job listings fell by 217,000 in July, leaving 3.22 job seekers per opening. Another way of putting that: there are 9.7 million more people out of work than there are advertised openings.
On the bright side, a few large states showed growth in online job listings, including Minnesota, North Carolina, Ohio and Washington. In one state - North Dakota - vacancies actually exceeded the number of unemployed people. That's not a surprise, though. Oil has kept that state booming while the rest of the country has suffered.
But listings fell in California and New York. In another worrying sign, openings for health care providers and technicians, one of the few categories that has had consistent growth throughout the recession and technical recovery, slipped by 61,200. And ads for home health care aides fell by 11,900.
Online listings increased in construction and food service. But construction was so hard hit by the housing downturn that there are still 17 unemployed workers for every opening. And in food service, there are seven job seekers for each opening.

HEADLINE: A Bigger 'Battle of the Buildings'

BYLINE: JOANNA M. FOSTER


HIGHLIGHT: This year, 245 buildings -- including hospitals, schools, banks and churches -- are competing to reduce their energy consumption, up from 14 last year.

 BODY:
Imagine the TV show "The Biggest Loser," only the contestants are big buildings, and instead of competing to shed unwanted pounds, it's a race to reduce unnecessary energy consumption. 
That is how Maura Beard, director of strategic communications for Energy Star, describes the Environmental Protection Agency's national "Battle of the Buildings" competition, which celebrated its successes thus far last week with a midpoint weigh-in for the contenders. 
Collectively, the 245 competing buildings are said to have already saved $3.7 million on their utility bills -- equivalent to the annual energy consumption of over 2,300 homes.
Commercial buildings are generally energy overeaters. They account for nearly 20 percent of all energy consumed in the country, and about one-third of that is completely wasted, the program says -- lights left on in empty conference rooms, for example, or multistory buildings that are fully air-conditioned in the dead of night. 
An estimated $300 million in energy is wasted by commercial buildings each year. But unlike homeowners, who face the consequences from cranking up the AC when their utility bills arrive, managers and workers can be lazy about switching off lights or turning up the thermostat and not necessarily feel it in their wallets.That is why interval meters, which report energy use every 15 minutes, have become hugely popular among entrants in this year's competition, Ms. Beard said. 
Such meters have been introduced, for example, at Coal Ridge High School in New Castle, Colo., a leading contender that has cut its energy use by about 10.5 percent. 
"I's really empowering for everyone at the school," said Theresa Hamilton, director of districtwide services for the local school district. The school has also retrofitted its light fixtures to be more energy-efficient.
"The interval meters let us measure how installing occupancy sensors, and switching to more efficient lighting is helping to cut costs," she said. "It also gets the kids really excited because they get instant feedback and can see how every little thing they do can help the school win." 
Last year, just 14 buildings entered the competition. This year's 245 entrants represent 12 different categories, from hospitals to schools to banks to churches.
Last year's winner was a college dorm, Morrison Residence Hall at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which is said to have reduced its energy consumption by 36 percent. This year, the top contender, a garage complex at the University of Central Florida, is reported to have already reduced its energy consumption by 31 percent.
Ms. Beard said this year's competitors ran the gamut in age as well. "We have buildings this year that were built in the 1800s and others that are only a few years old," she said, "and every one of them is finding ways to improve efficiency, reduce waste and save money." 
The winner is to be announced in November.

HEADLINE: A Taxi-Industry Battle Continues, With Echoes of 1971

BYLINE: MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: A conflict over a plan that would allow livery cabs to pick up street hails outside the densest parts of Manhattan has much in common with a fight 40 years ago.

 BODY:
This yellow-streaked city is no stranger to bitterly fought wars within its taxi industry, a saga that at times can resemble a daytime soap opera. Call it "As the Taxi Turns."
Imagine this not-unfamiliar scenario: a beleaguered taxi commissioner (and former city councilman) wants more regulation of the hordes of unlicensed, uninspected gypsy cabs that cruise the streets of the outer boroughs. He sets out to convince leaders of the taxi industry that more regulation is in their favor.
Over our Turtle-Waxed bodies, say the medallion owners, who argue that a new city-approved class of competing cabs would siphon away business and make their pricey medallions worthless. Regulation "spells doom for the whole industry," warned one taxicab Cassandra. 
Reader, the year of this Alamo-like standoff was 1971. Those medallions that were at risk? Worth about $20,000 apiece, give or take, about one forty-seventh of what one goes for on the open market today. (Even factoring in inflation, medallions are worth about eight times more now than they were then.)
The 2011 version of this conflict has been playing out over the past few months as the Bloomberg administration, led by the taxi commissioner and former councilman David S. Yassky, tries to implement a plan that would allow a new class of livery cab to pick up passengers off the street, anywhere but the densest parts of Manhattan.
The city says it wants every New Yorker to enjoy the La Guardia-given right of a safe, clean ride in a taxi, a privilege that usually extends only to Manhattan below 96th Street, where about 95 percent of the city's taxi pickups occur.
The taxi industry, however, is staunchly opposed, arguing that they would, yep, lose business, and that their medallions would lose value. "This is life and death for the yellow taxi industry," said one industry insider.
The elements of these fights are telltale: the calamitous rhetoric conveyed by worried businessmen, the falsely utopian visions set forth by City Hall. In the end, neither doom nor nirvana seem to come to pass.
In 1971, Michael J. Lazar, the chairman of the Taxi and Limousine Commission, announced that he would bring "an end to the city's gypsy-cab problem." Gypsy cabs, which cruised the yellowless provinces of the Bronx, Queens and outer Brooklyn, would soon be allowed to operate legally, as long as they agreed to take only trips arranged on the telephone.
"Regulation of livery vehicles will ensure that the drivers are of good moral character, that the cars are safe, that they carry adequate insurance and that the riding public is thoroughly protected," Mr. Lazar said.
The yellow-cab industry cried foul, and so did the gypsy drivers, who believed that stricter enforcement would kill off their lucrative, if illegal, cruising business -- the same complaint levied today by some livery cab drivers who believe Mayor Bloomberg's proposal will cut down on their income.
This time around, the biggest protests have been peaceful gatherings outside City Hall. In 1971, gypsy drivers tangled up traffic and lit bonfires on Southern Boulevard in the South Bronx. 
Firemen were pelted with bottles. The morning after a protest, 50 yellow-cab drivers found that their cars' back windows had been smashed in with garbage bins and bricks.
In another historical echo, gypsy cab drivers complained that they provided a critical service to areas of the city under-served by yellow cabs. Arranged rides "might work in middle-class areas where everyone has a telephone to call for a cab, but in the ghetto areas, you've simply got to have cabs that cruise," said one gypsy-cab lawyer at the time. "The medallions cabs won't do it, so our people do it."
The city's proposal eventually went through, and the gypsy cabs of yore became the livery cabs of today. Now, ironically enough, City Hall is facing a similar fight to allow those livery cabs to pick up street hails - the very thing those drivers wanted back in 1971.
By 1973, Mr. Lazar, the taxi commissioner, said he was fed up with the battles and would most likely abdicate his perch within a year, a promise he made good on.
"I don't think I can last more than that," he told The New York Times. "I was a city councilman for six years, and that was child's play compared to this."
Years later, Mr. Lazar would be indicted on federal racketeering charges stemming from bribes he provided to city parking officials; he was eventually sentenced to three years in prison and a fine of $200,000.
Medallion values, meanwhile, continued to grow; a medallion was sold last year for nearly $1 million. And tug-of-war among taxi officials, from the city and industry both, continues.

HEADLINE: Original Model T's | Jorge Colombo

BYLINE: NAOMI FRY


HIGHLIGHT: The second in our series of T's is by the iPhone finger-painter known for his 'valentines' to New York. 

 BODY:
There are artists who like to sequester themselves in their studios and tune out the world, and then there is Jorge Colombo, a modern-day version of Baudelaire's : a "passionate spectator," intent on observing the urban landscape. Colombo prefers to stand unobtrusively in the street, iPhone or (more rarely, due to its size) iPad in hand, and finger-paint on its touch screen. With the wide eyes of the tourist he is not - he has lived in the United States since 1989, and in New York for the past 13 years - Colombo is that uncommon specimen, a New Yorker who actually takes time to pause and hear the churn of the city.
Which is exactly what makes this Lisbon-born illustrator so unique. Colombo's cover for the June 1, 2009 issue of The New Yorker was the first such one drawn for a major magazine using the iPhone application Brushes, and he continues to be an on-location documenter, creating what he calls "un-ironic valentines" to his city. "I like to keep the perspective of a newcomer," Colombo said, "that innocence that can still take in what is distinctive about the landscape of the city." And valentines they are - seductive and charming and full of warmth. (Many of them will be collected in the book "New York: Finger Paintings by Jorge Colombo," due out in October.)
His reinterpretations of the T as billboard and road sign are striking not just for the formal elegance and economy of Colombo's line - his finger adding, taking away and adding again, in what amounts to something of a dance - but also for the ease with which he captures the quintessence of these two metropolitan icons: that inverted cupid's bow that makes up the top of the sign's logo; those black rectangles turning into high-rises flanking the billboard's infrastructure. The ambient soundtracks attached to the pieces (one taped on a downtown Manhattan rooftop, the other near the Brooklyn Queens Expressway) further exemplify the artist's commitment to a careful representation of the urban environment that surrounds him.
Colombo stresses that what is most important about his illustrations isn't necessarily the innovative technology he uses, since the iPhone and iPad "will eventually become just tools like any others in an illustrator's tool kit." He admits, however, that the narrative element that digital painting allows for, when its making is revealed in stroke-by-stroke videos as it is in the T's featured here, does affect his process. "Since the T logo is the thing that everyone is expecting to see anyway, I put that in first," he said. "But once that's done, I like to keep the viewers guessing what I'm about to draw." Colombo, in other words, is urging us to slow down, be patient, and look: we might just be surprised.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Continues to Spend Big on Lobbying

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: The financial industry has spent more than $100 million so far this year to court regulators and lawmakers, who are finalizing new regulations for lending, trading and debit card fees.

 BODY:
As the Dodd-Frank act marks its one-year anniversary, Wall Street's army of lobbying continue their aggressive campaign to tame the financial regulatory law. 
The financial industry has spent more than $100 million so far this year to court regulators and lawmakers, who are finalizing new regulations for lending, trading and debit card fees. During the second quarter, Wall Street spent $50.3 million on lobbying, a small dip from the prior period, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics. 
"In 2010, the Dodd-Frank financial reform was one of the biggest shows in town and that continues this year," said Michael Beckel, a spokesman for the center. 
Big banks are among the most prolific spenders. JPMorgan Chase's team in-house lobbyists spent $3.3 million, a slight uptick over last year. The biggest war chest among organizations focused primarily on Dodd-Frank belongs to the American Bankers Association, which so far spent $4.6 million on lobbying. The organization wrestled the top spending spot from the Financial Services Roundtable, a fellow trade group that represents 100 of the nation's largest financial firms. 
Overall lobbying is down about five percent from last year when lawmakers were writing Dodd-Frank, though spending remains high as financial regulators carry out the broad mandate. Rather than dictate the minutiae of every rule, lawmakers instructed regulators to write some 300 new rules for Wall Street. 
"Until it is chiseled in stone, the lobbying continues," noted Mr. Beckel. 
Lobbyists focused their fight in recent months on the first major batch of Dodd-Frank deadlines that loomed in July, the law's one-year anniversary. The milestone was supposed to mark Day One for many Dodd-Frank derivatives rules. 
But under pressure from industry lobbyists, regulators backed off the deadlines. In June, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission agreed to delay the derivatives rules for up to six months. Meanwhile, The C.F.T.C. is also backing off a plan curb banks' control over the derivatives market, according to people with knowledge of the matter. 
Wall Street's campaign also yielded results from the Federal Reserve. In late June, the Fed softened restrictions on fees that banks charge retailers for debit-card purchases, saving the financial industry an estimated $3.5 billion a year. 
Much of the wrangling over the rules has played out during closed-door meetings in Washington. Overall, regulators held more than 2,100 Dodd-Frank meetings since the law passed last July. 
The commodity commission, in particular, has been a hot spot for lobbying action. The agency's chairman, Gary Gensler, has held at least 165 meetings on Dodd-Frank -- the most of any regulator, according to the Sunlight Foundation, a watchdog group that monitors lobbying in Washington. Next in line with 106 meetings is Elizabeth Warren, the Obama administration official who helped launch the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. 
The petitioners include a range of banks, Wall Street lobbying firms and consumer groups. Goldman paid 83 visits to regulators, the most of any bank, to discuss derivatives among other topics. 
But Dodd-Frank meetings are not limited to technical discussions of arcane financial products.
The Banking Agency of the Federation of Bosnia-Herzogovina met with the Federal Reserve about "implications of the Dodd-Frank Act to emerging economies," according to the Sunlight Foundation. The Democratic Republic of Congo also dispatched officials to huddle with the S.E.C. about Dodd-Frank's little-known requirement that corporations disclose whether they manufacture products using so-called conflict minerals from Congo. A cross section of corporate interests -- from 7-Eleven and Target to the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad and JetBlue Airways -- also weighed in. 
"It's amazing how far-reaching Dodd-Frank is, and how much impact it will have beyond the financial sector," said Bill Allison, Sunlight's editorial director.

HEADLINE: Appeals Court Overturns 5 Gen Re and A.I.G. Convictions

BYLINE: DEALBOOK


HIGHLIGHT: The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit says lower court erred in allowing stock-price data and in issuing a flawed jury instruction.

 BODY:
A federal appeals court has reversed the convictions of four former executives of General Reinsurance and one from American International Group, saying that a lower court erred by allowing the government to present stock-price data and by issuing a flawed jury instruction.
Ronald Ferguson, the former C.E.O. of General Re, which is owned by Warren E. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, and Elizabeth Monrad, Robert Graham and Christopher P. Garand of General Re and Christian Milton of A.I.G. were convicted of fraud and conspiracy charges by a federal jury in Hartford in 2008. 
On Monday, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ordered a new trial of the five. 
At the center of the case was a reinsurance transaction, initiated in October 2000, that prosecutors said inflated A.I.G.'s reserves. Investigations into the transaction and other accounting issues led to the resignation of A.I.G.'s longtime chief, Maurice Greenberg in 2005. (Mr. Greenberg was not charged in the case.)
Chief Judge Dennis Jacobs, writing for the three-judge panel, said the district court was inconsistent on stock price data during the trial. It excluded a chart showing the decline in A.I.G.'s stock price from February through March 2005, noting that there were other factors beyond the transaction in question. But the court allowed the government to show the jury three bar charts.
"The court's solution, to allow only isolated ranges of stock-price data, did not mitigate the prejudice: Instead of a downward line, there were three dropping sets of dots; it is inevitable that jurors would connect them," Judge Jacobs wrote. 
The suggestion that questions about the Gen Re transaction caused a 12 percent drop in A.I.G.'s stock "prejudicially cast the defendants as causing an economic downturn that has affected every family in America," the appeals panel wrote. 
The district court judge, Christopher Droney, also erred in his instructions to the jury, the panel said. 
In its survey of the history of the case, the appeals court ruling notes the Oct. 31, 2000 phone call between Mr. Ferguson and Mr. Greenberg to discuss ways to shore up A.I.G.'s reserves. The court says: 
An important question for this case is whether the callbetween Ferguson and Greenberg initiated a conspiracy. Itmay have been a high-level brainstorming session about usingaccounting rules aggressively--but lawfully--to achieve anaccounting objective; but it may (instead or also) have beenan unlawful agreement to deceive A.I.G. stockholders by bookinga no-risk transaction (which by definition would not satisfyFAS 113) as reinsurance.

HEADLINE: Debt Deal: Some Read It and Weep, Others Swallow Hard and Nod

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Liberal or conservative, many politicians on both ideological wings rub their bleary eyes and complain about the compromise reached last night by their leaders on a fiscal package, but others say they can live with it.

 BODY:
Liberals and conservatives woke up on Monday morning and began assessing the last-minute debt ceiling deal reached by leaders in Washington over the weekend.
Many liberals are grousing about President Obama's willingness to abandon some of the things he had demanded. Some conservatives are griping that the deal doesn't do enough to cut spending. And some members of both parties are declaring the deal good enough, if not exactly great.
Here's a sampling of the early reaction:
DEMOCRATS:
* Representative Emanuel Cleaver, Democrat of Missouri: "If I were a Republican, this is a night to party," he said to MSNBC.
* Representative Raul Grijalva, Democrat of Arizona: "This deal trades people's livelihoods for the votes of a few unappeasable right-wing radicals, and I will not support it. This deal weakens the Democratic Party as badly as it weakens the country," he added. "We have given much and received nothing in return. The lesson today is that Republicans can hold their breath long enough to get what they want."
* Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader: "I look forward to reviewing the legislation with my caucus to see what level of support we can provide."
* Donna Brazille, Democratic strategist, via Twitter: "Fellow citizens, good night. The debate was one sided - so no winners, no losers. Claim your JOY! No whining because we're in this together." 
 "The GOP won the debate by playing quick & loose w/the truth. Bullyingeveryone, incl media. Stonewalling. Arrogance. This was unnecessary." 
* Robert Reich, former secretary of labor under Bill Clinton, via Twitter: "The heinous deal is preferable to economic catastrophe. The outrage and shame is it has come to this choice."
"The radical right has won a huge tactical and strategic victory. Democrats have proven they have no tactics and no strategy."
"It is not the case that 'both sides' gave up 'sacred cows.' Rs linked the debt ceiling to their demand for smaller govt. They've got it." 
REPUBLICANS: 
* Representative Allen West of Florida: "At this time I believe this is a good plan for the American people."
* Jon Huntsman, former governor of Utah and presidential candidate: "While some of my opponents ducked the debate entirely, others would have allowed the nation to slide into default and President Obama refused to offer any plan, I have been proud to stand with congressional Republicans working for these needed and historic cuts. A debt crisis like this is a time for leadership, not a time for waiting to see which way the political winds blow."
* Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, a presidential candidate: "Throughout this process the President has failed to lead and failed to provide a plan. The 'deal' he announced spends too much and doesn't cut enough. This isn't the deal the American people 'preferred' either, Mr. President. Someone has to say no. I will."
* Representative Connie Mack, Republican of Florida, On MCNBC: "I don't think the American people are looking for a deal or a compromise, they are looking for a solution to the problem. At the end of the day, I can't vote for something that is going to ensure that we have over $17 trillion in debt."

HEADLINE: Mitt Romney Opposes Debt Compromise

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: After sitting almost silent on the sidelines for weeks, Mitt Romney criticized potential tax increases and defense cuts in the plan.

 BODY:
After sitting almost silent on the sidelines for weeks, Mitt Romney on Monday declared that he is opposed to the debt ceiling compromise hammered out in Washington over the weekend.
The former Massachusetts governor and presidential frontrunner said in a brief statement from his campaign that he will not support the bill.
"While I appreciate the extraordinarily difficult situation President Obama's lack of leadership has placed Republican members of Congress in, I personally cannot support this deal," he said.
In a statement just before a vote on legislation that Republican congressional leaders are urging their members to support, Mr. Romney said that the bill "opens the door" to higher taxes and blamed President Obama for a failure of leadership.
"As president, my plan would have produced a budget that was cut, capped and balanced - not one that opens the door to higher taxes and puts defense cuts on the table," Mr. Romney said. "President Obama's leadership failure has pushed the economy to the brink at the eleventh hour and 59th minute."
Mr. Romney, whose central argument that he should be president is about his economic prowess, has been largely absent during the extended Washington debate over whether -- and how -- to raise the debt ceiling.
Throughout the debate, Mr. Romney has been careful to weigh in only with vague expressions of support for Republicans in Congress. The absence of a full-throated economic argument from Mr. Romney has been noted by his rivals.
Jon M. Huntsman Jr., the former governor of Utah and a 2012 Republican hopeful, was one of the first presidential candidates to embrace the compromise Sunday night. In a statement, he took aim at Mr. Romney's vagueness as well as his other rivals, who have criticized the deal-making in Washington.
"While some of my opponents ducked the debate entirely, others would have allowed the nation to slide into default and President Obama refused to offer any plan, I have been proud to stand with congressional Republicans working for these needed and historic cuts," Mr. Huntsman said.
Mr. Romney's opposition to the debt deal positions him on the same side of the argument as Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, who has been a vocal critic of any plan that includes a increase to the debt ceiling. Mrs. Bachmann returned to Washington from campaign events in Iowa to vote against the plan.
The decision to oppose the compromise also allows Mr. Romney to argue that he has not strayed from Tea Party conservatives who think the legislation does not go far enough to cut the budget and restrain spending.

Mr. Romney, whose central argument of why he should be president is based on his economic prowess, has been largely absent during the extended Washington debate over whether -- and how -- to raise the debt ceiling.
Throughout the debate, Mr. Romney has been careful to weigh in with only vague expressions of support for Republicans in Congress. The absence of a full-throated economic argument from Mr. Romney has been noted by his rivals.

The decision to oppose the compromise also allows Mr. Romney to argue that he has not strayed from Tea Party conservatives who think the legislation does not go far enough in cutting the budget and restraining spending.Alex Conant, a spokesman for Tim Pawlenty, the former governor of Minnesota who is also seeking the Republican nomination, said Mr. Pawlenty believed that "this deal is nothing to celebrate.""Only in Washington would the political class think it's a victory when the government narrowly avoids default, agrees to go further into debt, and does little to reform a spending system that cannot be sustained by our children and grandchildren," Mr. Conant said.Mr. Conant did not say whether Mr. Pawlenty believed that lawmakers should vote for the debt ceiling bill or not. But he took aim at Mr. Obama, saying that "while no further evidence was needed, this entire debt ceiling fiasco demonstrates that President Obama must be replaced."

HEADLINE: A Teachable Moment for Young Republicans

BYLINE: SEAN COLLINS WALSH


HIGHLIGHT: The annual College Republicans convention in Washington coincided, conveniently, with the tense, last-minute negotiations in Congress over raising the federal government's borrowing limit before a Tuesday deadline, offering attendees a vivid lesson in economics, modern civics and political science.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - Crossing a generational divide in politics can be difficult, as former Governor Jon M. Huntsman Jr. of Utah, a candidate for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, made clear when he referred to "the Google" in a speech to kick off the annual convention of the College Republicans National Committee over the weekend.
But there is one very adult issue that has caused many young conservatives to connect with the political process: finding work after college.
Joblessness, after all, is higher among young people than it is for the country as a whole. "So many of my friends have graduated and can't find jobs," said Mick Paskiewicz, a student at DePaul University in Chicago who attended the College Republicans convention this weekend here at the Renaissance Marriott Hotel in Dupont Circle.
Many of the 600 or so attendees at the conference said unemployment was their reason for becoming politically active. Mr. Paskiewicz, 22, who was a campaign worker for Representative Robert Dold, Republican of Illinois, said the recent attention given to the country's economic and fiscal troubles was encouraging young conservatives to become more outspoken, defying the traditional view of college students as either liberal or politically apathetic.
"The focus of the debate has shifted from cultural issues," Mr. Paskiewicz said.
The event coincided, conveniently, with the tense, last-minute negotiations in Congress over raising the federal government's borrowing limit before a Tuesday deadline, offering attendees a vivid lesson in economics, modern civics and political science.
The fiscal battle amounts to an ideological debate over the appropriate role of government, pitting Democrats against Republicans, of course, but also establishment Republicans against freshman legislators in their party who are intent on imposing fiscal discipline without compromise.
And so the party's very public soul-searching exercise was on display at the Renaissance Marriott. Mr. Paskiewicz, for one, said he thought the debt limit needed to be raised, although he said Congress should enact measures to keep debt off "our tab," meaning young people.
Mark Ciavola, a student at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, said he supported temporarily raising the limit, although he said Congress needed "to take measures to make sure this is the last time."
Mr. Ciavola, 36, said he believed young adults could become an important group for Republicans.
"It's something I think has been missing for a long time," said Mr. Ciavola, who was recently featured in an campaign ad for Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor and a contender for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination. "Young people are starting to realize that hope and change are dead," he added.
The College Republicans organization has long been a breeding ground for Republican leaders, including the Bush strategist Karl Rove and Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee and a speaker at this weekend's event.
"I wish I could still hang out with you and have a beer or whatever you're going to have tonight," said Mr. Preibus, who was president of College Republicans when he attended the University of Wisconsin.
Several of the speakers used social media and smartphones to appeal to the students. Mr. Preibus told the students to send a text message with the word "unite" to 91919 to become active in the Republican National Committee.
Ed Gillespie, chairman of the Republican State Leadership Committee, a national party organization focused on financing state races, used a similar strategy - text "RSLC" to 21824 - and even offered the first 100 respondents scholarships to attend an event his organization was holding.
Mr. Gillespie said he was traveling to New Jersey after the conference and drew a mix of laughs and groans by referring to the reality TV show "Jersey Shore."
"If I see Snooki, I will send the College Republicans' love her way," he said.
Dick Morris, the Republican political strategist, conducted a show-of-hands poll of the crowd's preferences among the Republican presidential field. First, he tested a list of the candidates who have officially entered the race. In that vote, Mr. Romney narrowly edged out Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota. The other candidates received only a handful of votes.
Then, Mr. Morris added to the list Governor Rick Perry of Texas, who has not yet announced whether he is running. Mr. Perry won overwhelmingly.
"He could be someone who really is potent in both camps," Mr. Morris said, meaning both the Republican establishment and the insurgent conservative movement.

HEADLINE: House Passes Compromise Debt Bill

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: The final vote was 269 to 161, with 66 Republicans and 95 Democrats voting no. The Senate was set to take up the bill at noon on Tuesday.

 BODY:
7:42 p.m. | Updated The House of Representatives approved the debt ceiling bargain negotiated over the weekend by President Obama and leaders from both parties, sending the measure to the Senate. Final approval that could come Tuesday.
Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, told his colleagues that the Senate will take up the debt bill at noon on Tuesday, just hours before the midnight deadline when the nation's borrowing authority will run out.
The final vote was 269 to 161, with 66 Republicans and 95 Democrats voting no. Many Democratic lawmakers joined dozens of Tea Party-backed Republicans in calling it a bad deal for the country. But the complicated legislation to raise the debt ceiling by $2.1 trillion earned the support of members from both parties to win approval.
Senators said they planned to take up the legislation as soon as Monday evening or Tuesday, hours before a deadline that might have led to a federal default. 
The passage came in dramatic fashion as Representative Gabrielle Giffords, Democrat of Arizona, made her first appearance back in the chamber since she was shot in the head by an assailant during a meet and greet in her district. Members in both parties stood up for a long and enthusiastic standing ovation for Ms. Giffords, who entered dressed in a teal shirt and with her brown hair trimmed short. She has been recuperating since the shooting and it had been unclear when she would return.
The deal's passage in the House was a relief for the White House and legislative leaders, who had come together Sunday night to hail the agreement as an eleventh-hour compromise that satisfied the most important principles for both Democrats and Republicans.
Their membership had been skeptical. The left criticized the measure as an abandonment of the protections for the poor, the middle class and the elderly. The right called it a weak and too-timid effort to rein in federal spending in the face of a $14 trillion debt.
But a majority of members from both parties voted for the measure after saying it was necessary to avoid the potential for a global economic calamity and a good start toward trimming the size of the national debt.

HEADLINE: Marking a Year of Letter Grades for City Restaurants

BYLINE: ADRIANE QUINLAN


HIGHLIGHT: A year after restaurants began receiving letter grades for cleanliness, the city proclaims the program a success, while some restaurant owners say otherwise.

 BODY:
When city inspectors started giving letter grades for cleanliness to restaurants a year ago, restaurant owners were not pleased. 
 The grades, which are supposed to be posted in a prominent location visible from the street, were accompanied by strict standards that resulted in greater fines for owners. And even the first restaurant in the city to receive an A, Spark's Deli in Queens, was required to pay $800 for violations that included a cashier drinking coffee in an area where it was not permitted. 
Many restaurant owners worried that any grade but an A would ruin business -- the two other grades are B for passing and C for failing. 
But a year into the program, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg on Monday stood outside Spark's, an unassuming sandwich place in Long Island City, and proclaimed the letter-grading system a success. "Our restaurant rating system is definitely making the grade with customers and with owners alike," Mr. Bloomberg said. "It provides restaurantgoers with information that's really important to them and that they really appreciate." 
Mr. Bloomberg also said that the system had been good for business. There are about 24,000 restaurants in New York City, 90 percent of which have been inspected so far. Of those, 69 percent have received A grades, according to a statement from the mayor's office. 
The high percentage of restaurants earning the highest grade was evidence that restaurants that had initially received a B or a C had improved on follow-up inspections or had successfully appealed lower grades, said Dr. Thomas A. Farley, the city's health commissioner. "The point is that all these restaurants are improving and that's exactly what we were trying to accomplish when we set up the system in the first place," Dr. Farley said. "New York City is known for its world-class restaurants. With this new system, we'll also be known as the city with the safest restaurants."
For those restaurants that earned top marks, a good grade can translate into more business, Mr. Bloomberg said. He cited a recent study conducted for the city by Baruch College that found that a high percentage of diners surveyed considered grades when deciding where to eat. 
Mr. Bloomberg also noted a change made to the system six months ago that eliminated fines for restaurants that earn A grades on a first inspection. That waiver saved 8,000 restaurants about $3 million in fines, Mr. Bloomberg said. 
"This is going to be an economic incentive, and encourage behavior," Dr. Farley said of the waiver. "We saw we were getting an increase in fines, which wasn't the goal of the program." 
But some restaurant owners and trade groups consider the inspection system discriminatory and expensive. Andrew Rigie, executive vice president of the New York City chapter of the New York State Restaurant Association, said that the revised system of waiving fines for establishments with an initial A grade still burdens those restaurants that earn an A through the appeal process. 
And restaurants with B's and C's are likely to lose customers who pay attention to the letter grades, even if they are still fit to eat in, Mr. Rigie said. With the combination of court fees and multiple inspections, the system is more expensive and onerous than ever, he added.
"The city needs to move away from a model of levying millions of dollars on small business owners and shaming local restaurant owners," Mr. Rigie said.
At Manducatis, a white-tablecloth Italian restaurant in Long Island City and a Queens institution, the manager, Anthony Cerbone, said that an initial grade of B, for an espresso machine positioned too far from a sink, scared off some customers and made loyalists shrug and ask, "What's with the B?" 
The restaurant received an A in a follow-up inspection, but Mr. Cerbone said the inspections were expensive and disruptive, with inspectors staying for hours during lunchtime rushes. 
Still, whatever the debate over the new letter-grade system, receiving an A appears to be worth it. The survey by Baruch College, which was conducted by telephone and was paid for with a grant from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, found that 70 percent of New Yorkers reported noticing the grades in the windows. And of those, 88 percent considered them when deciding where to eat. 
As she looked for a restaurant with a friend in Koreatown in Manhattan, Amie Kreisberg, 44, of the Upper West Side, said she took the grades into consideration. The B at a nearby barbecue place was "definitely a deterrent," she said. "Even if we had a reservation, if we walked in and saw a bad grade, I wouldn't go in."
 Instead, she scanned the menu of another nearby barbecue restaurant, Kum Gang San. 
"What's the letter?" she asked her friend. 
"A." 
And in they went.

HEADLINE: The Fine Print on the Debt Deal

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: If Democrats read the fine print on the debt deal struck by President Obama and Congressional leaders, they'll find that it's a little better than it appears at first glance.

 BODY:
If Democrats read the fine print on the debt dealstruck by President Obama and Congressional leaders, they'll find that it's a little better than it appears at first glance.
That's not to say that the deal is a good one for them. It concedes a lot to Republicans, and Democrats may be wondering why any of this was necessary in the first place. But the good news, relatively speaking, has to do with the timing and structure of the spending cuts contained in the deal.
First, the timing: the cuts are heavily back-loaded, so the deal is unlikely to have much direct effect on the economy in 2012.
The spending cuts will proceed in two stages. There is an initial round of about $1 trillion in cuts, which will be locked in place when (and if) the deal is signed by the president. Then there is an additional $1.5 trillion in cuts, which will go into effect if Congress is unable to agree to the recommendations of a bipartisan commission (or "Super Congress") by the end of the year.
The first round of cuts include "only" about $22 billion in reductions in 2012 spending -- the same as the bill proposed last week by Representative John A. Boehner, which provided some of the outlines for this deal. That would reduce 2012 G.D.P. by just 0.1 percent, other factors being equal.
The second and larger round of cuts, according to the White House's summary of the deal, would not include any reductions to the fiscal year 2012 budget. Instead, those cuts would kick in during 2013 and last through 2022.
Congress could decide to accept the bipartisan commission's recommendations, which would override the second round of cuts and identify some new mechanisms to provide for $1.5 trillion in deficit savings, although for reasons I will detail below, this is unlikely. And even if it did, one presumes that Congressional Democrats would insist that the new measures abide by the spirit of the original bill and back-load the cuts. 
The bill, in short, is not likely to have a profound effect on the recovery in the near-term. It should be noted, of course, that the recovery still has plenty of its own problems, and that fiscal policy in 2012 will tend to be contractionary on the whole as the last vestiges of the 2009 stimulus roll off the budget and as the payroll tax cuts agreed to for 2011 expire. But that would be true even if a "clean" debt ceiling increase had been adopted with no changes to fiscal policy.
Where the deal may create more problems is in 2013 and 2014. The economy may not be fully healthy by then -- global financial crises often take 5 years or more to recover from. But the austerity measures will really start to kick in. Whichever party has a strong 2012 could therefore have a rough 2014.
Of course, whichever party was elected in 2012 could begin charting its own course for fiscal policy in 2013. The deal employs some mechanisms to create inertia behind the cuts -- in particular, caps on discretionary spending -- but fundamentally it is very difficult to bind the actions of a future Congress.
That gets at the other reason why this deal should be slightly more palatable for Democrats. The further you go out in time, the more likely it is that the cuts enshrined in this deal will have been swamped by more recent changes to policy.
That isn't to say that the cuts are an accounting fiction. Particularly when control of the government remains divided, the status quo may tend to prevail. But they need to be discounted fairly heavily, especially in the back half of the deal where the bulk of the cuts are concentrated.
Cuts Heavily Weighted Toward Defense Spending
One narrow way to read the deal is that both sides got what they wanted. President Obama got an assurance that the debt ceiling will be raised through the end of his first term (although the increase will take place in stages). Republicans achieved their dual goals of avoiding tax increases and getting a dollar-for-dollar increase in spending cuts to match the amount by which the debt limit will be raised.
The problem with that interpretation, of course, is that the Republicans' goals were much more ambitious -- and they were able to achieve them all the same. That's why by any reasonable standard, this deal was a "win" for Republicans on the policy merits.
But given that Democrats were willing to accede to the constraints demanded by Republicans, they were able to exert a lot of control over the substance of the cuts. In particular, the first round of cuts will include $350 billion in defense savings, while the second round would include between $500 and $600 billion in defense cuts if no bipartisan agreement is reached.
There are some semantic distinctions to heed here -- for instance, between defense cuts and "security" cuts. But the bottom line is that the deal will take a big bite out of the Pentagon's budget. Close to half of the overall cuts, not counting interest savings, will come from defense and related areas.
This ought to be a big deal for Democrats, since many of them are favorably disposed toward cuts in the defense budget. The table below reflects the views of Democratic and Republican adults toward cuts in 18 areas of federal spending as derived from the 2010 General Social Survey. The scale runs from 0 (meaning that voters would like to see increased spending in that area) to 100 (meaning that voters would like to see spending cuts).
The defense budget has the largest partisan split of any of the 18 areas, and is the only one in which Democrats tend to prefer spending cuts while Republicans tend to prefer spending increases.
This has two major implications. The first is simply that if you're scoring the deal as a Democrat, it makes the cuts less painful. In fact, if you're a Democrat (or a libertarian) who is not just indifferent toward defense cuts but actually in favor of them, you might even regard the cuts to defense spending as a "win," making up for the "loss" incurred from cuts to other types of discretionary spending.
The other implication comes from the effect this might have on the bipartisan panel. If its recommendations are not agreed to -- or if it can't come to an agreement in the first place -- $1.5 trillion in cuts would be triggered, half of which would come from defense.
If you're a Democrat and you accede to $1.5 trillion in cuts -- and that's literally the situation that Democrats will find themselves in if the deal passes through Congress -- it's going to be hard to do better than $1.5 trillion in cuts. They are very heavily loaded with defense cuts, while containing few changes to entitlement programs or to programs which benefit the poor.
So Democrats will have very little incentive to vote for the panel's recommendations they include tax increases. Does that mean that Republicans will agree to tax increases? Perhaps the Republicans on the committee will consider them -- but it is unlikely that rank-and-file in the House will give their sign-off.
In other words, this probably leads us to a stalemate: Democrats cannot do much better unless there are tax increases, and Republicans will not be eager to raise taxes. So the automatic cuts embodied in the trigger are quite likely to go into effect -- and those are the sorts of cuts that Democrats, not Republicans, would prefer to make to the budget.
Harm to Democrats' Morale
Nevertheless, this will be an extremely difficult deal for Mr. Obama to sell to Democratic voters, and with good reason.
In the past, the debt limit has not been used as a vehicle for substantial changes to fiscal policy. And even if Republicans were keen to exploit the law this time around, the fight could have been avoided had Democrats agreed to a longer-term increase in the debt limit while they still controlled Congress in 2010, particularly during the lame-duck session.
Moreover, Republicans had conceded early on that the debt limit must be increased, calling into question how much leverage they had.
But the White House's strategy was confused -- at first, calling for a "clean" vote on the debt ceiling, but soon backing off that position without a clear set of objectives to replace it.
And then, toward the end of the process, Mr. Obama appeared to usurp Mr. Reid, brokering a deal with the Republican leader Mitch McConnell while Mr. Reid was trying to whip votes for his bill, which would have included a long-term debt ceiling extension but fewer substantive spending cuts. This led to the highly unusual spectacle on Saturday of the Republican leaders bragging about their potential deal with the Democratic White House while an annoyed-looking Mr. Reid denied that a deal was imminent.
Overall, the deal served to confirm the worst suspicions held by some Democrats: first, that the White House is unwilling to drive a hard bargain or is poor at negotiation. And second, that it is loath to stand up for liberal values or has inherently conservative policy preferences.
These critiques are more common among those Democrats who criticize the White House frequently. But I have also heard them in recent days from Democrats who tend toward the center-left and who tend to defend the White House, some of whom cite the poor precedent that the deal has established. Meanwhile, Mr. Obama's approach has been criticized by some influential Democrats in Congress, like Raul M. Grijalva, the co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.
Fiscal austerity at a time of economic distress, and on largely Republican terms, is not what Democrats thought they were getting when they elected Mr. Obama in 2008. Mr. Obama might have done more to make short-term stimulus -- like further reductions to the payroll tax, which would would not have violated the Republicans' ostensible goals -- the price for long-term austerity.
Although it is impossible to prove one way or the other, I am not persuaded by the notion that Mr. Obama could not have delivered a better result to Democrats had he done more to stand his ground. Despite the dissent in the Republican caucus, which had originally seemed like a tactical victory for Democrats, the compromise wound up looking more like Mr. Boehner's original bill than Mr. Reid's.
With all that said, some of these concerns have to do with the aesthetics of the deal as much as the policy substance. The fine print is not quite as bad for Democrats as the headline number of $2.5 trillion in spending cuts. That's why some Republicans are having trouble being sold on the deal as well as some Democrats.

HEADLINE: What the White House Left on the Table

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: The vote on the debt ceiling bill shows that President Obama could have shifted the deal tangibly toward the left and still won passage without too much of a problem.

 BODY:
I wrote at length earlier Monday about why I think the proper characterization of the deal that President Obama struck with Republicans is "pretty bad" rather than "terrible." (That's from a Democratic point of view. For Republicans, I'd say the deal should be thought of as "quite good" rather than "awesome.")
It seems as if the results of the House's vote on Monday tend to back up that assertion. In the end, exactly half of the Democratic caucus members voted for the debt ceiling bill, which makes it hard to classify the deal as "terrible" from their point of view.
But almost three-quarters of Republicans voted in the affirmative. And even the Tea Party came around in the end. By 32-to-28, members of the Tea Party Caucus voted for the bill, despite earlier claims -- which now look like a bluff -- that they wouldn't vote to raise the debt ceiling under any circumstances.
These results seem to suggest that Mr. Obama left something on the table. That is, Mr. Obama could have shifted the deal tangibly toward the left and still gotten a bill through without too much of a problem. For instance, even if all members of the Tea Party Caucus had voted against the bill, it would still have passed 237-to-193, and that's with 95 Democrats voting against it.
Specifically, it seems likely that Mr. Obama could have gotten an extension of the payroll tax cut included in the bill, or unemployment benefits, either of which would have had a stimulative effect. Some Republicans would have complained that the new deal expanded rather than contracted the deficit in 2012, and Mr. Obama would have lost some of their votes. But this stimulus spending wouldn't have overtly violated their highest-priority goals (no new taxes, and a dollar in spending cuts for every dollar in borrowing authority). And Mr. Obama, evidently, had a few Republican votes he could afford to lose.
With that payroll tax cut, the deal becomes a much easier sell to Democrats -- and perhaps also to swing voters, particularly given that nobody spent much time during this debate talking about jobs. Plus, it would have improved growth in 2012 and, depending on how literally you take the economic models, improved Mr. Obama's re-election chances.
No, we can't know this for sure. Voting during roll calls can be tactical, and the results may have been skewed by the heartwarming and unexpected return of Representative Gabrielle Giffords to the House chamber. But this is at least a little bit more tangible than simply asserting that Mr. Obama did as well as he could under the circumstances.
It wouldn't have been a great deal for Democrats -- still no tax increases, still lots of spending cuts, still buying into Republicans' premise that the debt ceiling is an appropriate vehicle for fiscal reform. But it would have been a fair one, and better than what Mr. Obama got.

HEADLINE: Sign of Advancing Society? An Organized War Effort

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS WADE

 BODY:
Some archaeologists have painted primitive societies as relatively peaceful, implying that war is a reprehensible modern deviation. Others have seen war as the midwife of the first states that arose as human population increased and more complex social structures emerged to coordinate activities.
A wave of new research is supporting this second view. Charles Stanish and Abigail Levine, archaeologists at the University of California, Los Angeles, have traced the rise of the pristine states that preceded the Inca empire. The first villages in the region were formed some 3,500 years ago. Over the next 1,000 years, some developed into larger regional centers, spaced about 12 to 15 miles apart. Then, starting around 500 B.C., signs of warfare emerged in the form of trophy heads and depictions of warriors, the two archaeologists report in last week's Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 
One of the regional centers, Taraco, was destroyed in the first century A.D., probably by forces from Pukara, the other principal regional center of the area. Pukara enjoyed its status as a pristine state until about 500, when it was absorbed by Tiwanaku, the principal state on the other side of the Lake Titicaca basin.
A similar process of an early state's arising from warring chiefdoms has been described in the Oaxaca Valley of Mexico by Kent V. Flannery and Joyce Marcus, archaeologists at the University of Michigan. By 4,500 years ago, there were some 80 villages in the valley. As population increased, a period of intense warfare lasted from 2,450 to 2,000 years ago, culminating in the victory of one town over all the others in the valley and the formation of the Zapotec state.
With the same process now documented in both North and South America, ''we are coming closer to having a model for pristine state formation that may have worldwide significance,'' Dr. Marcus said. ''It also shows that our species, when thrust into almost identical circumstances, behaves in almost identical ways.''
Dr. Stanish believes that warfare was the midwife of the first states that arose in many regions of the world, including Mesopotamia and China as well as the Americas.
The first states, in his view, were not passive affairs driven by forces beyond human control, like climate and geography, as some historians have supposed. Rather, they were shaped by human choice as people sought new forms of cooperation and new institutions for the more complex societies that were developing. Trade was one of these cooperative institutions for consolidating larger-scale groups; warfare was the other.
Warfare may not usually be thought of as a form of cooperation, but organized hostilities between chiefdoms require that within each chiefdom people subordinate their individual self-interest to that of the group.
''Warfare is ultimately not a denial of the human capacity for social cooperation, but merely the most destructive expression of it,'' the anthropologist Lawrence H. Keeley writes in his book ''War Before Civilization'' (Oxford, 1996).
Compared with other species, humans are highly cooperative and altruistic, at least toward members of their own group. Evolutionary biologists have been hard pressed to account for this self-sacrificing behavior, given that an altruist who works for the benefit of others will have less time for his family's interests and leave fewer surviving children. Genes for altruistic behavior should therefore disappear.
Darwin's solution to this riddle was that groups of altruists would prevail over less cohesive groups. This implies that natural selection can operate on groups, not just individuals, a thesis that many biologists reject.
But group-level selection is more likely to operate the fiercer the competition is between groups. Samuel Bowles, an economist at the Santa Fe Institute, believes warfare between early human groups was intense, and explains the very slow growth of population prior to 20,000 years ago.
Warfare ''may have contributed to the spread of human altruism,'' he and his colleague Herbert Gintis write in their new book, ''A Cooperative Species''(Princeton, 2011). ''We initially recoiled at this unpleasant and surprising conclusion. But the simulations and the data on prehistoric warfare tell a convincing story.''
Archaeology lends some support to the idea. ''Groups that successfully organize themselves to raid others will acquire external resources and, in the long run, will be at a selective advantage against groups that are less well organized,'' Dr. Stanish and Dr. Levine write of their findings in the Central Andes.
''Both war and trade are sources of outside wealth,'' Dr. Stanish said in an interview. The leaders of early states had to keep people working. They relied on religious rituals to organize the labor force and material inducements from war and trade to satisfy the elite.
As the population in a region grew larger and richer, regional chiefdoms would form and start raiding one another for plunder. ''Once this kicks in, it sets up a dynamic in which it's hard to be peaceful,'' Dr. Stanish said. ''You either organize on a regional level or get killed or absorbed.''
Of the regional chiefdoms that start a war for dominance, all but one will perish before the pristine state is formed. So why not form nonaggression pacts rather than take such a gamble?
Dr. Marcus suggests two reasons. One is that human social skills evolved in the small hunter-gatherer groups in which everyone lived until 15,000 years ago. ''When humans try to run larger and more complex societies, with hereditary inequality, they are pushing their sociopolitical skills to the utmost,'' Dr. Marcus said.
Another reason is that elites who run chiefly societies ''are very aggressive and competitive -- they assassinate rivals even when they are siblings or half-siblings,'' Dr. Marcus said. ''Competitive interaction is one of the most powerful driving forces in evolution, whether biological or social.''

HEADLINE: Relief Rally Disappears After Fresh Economic Data Suggests Weakness

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER; Julie Creswell contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Hopes were high for a rally in stocks in the wake of Sunday's debt limit agreement. But the bounce was a thud.
On Monday, the three main indexes jumped then slumped for most of the day and closed lower as the reality of the challenges ahead for the economy set in.
This is a trend that some analysts say is likely to persist, even after any resolution in the debt ceiling debate and its prospects for downgrade or default. The main reason is worry about the nation's economic recovery, which recent data shows to be more fragile than originally thought. On Monday, the manufacturing sector showed signs of losing steam in July. 
''Now that the debt ceiling deal, assuming it passes, has averted an imminent catastrophe, attention can return to the underlying state of the economy,'' said Nigel Gault, the IHS Global Insight chief United States economist.
''The news there isn't good.''
On Monday, the stock market in the United States briefly followed European and Asian markets higher, lifting more than 1 percent shortly after the opening. But any relief over the last-minute agreement on the debt deal framework was fleeting.
After the first half-hour of trading, the three main Wall Street indexes turned negative and mostly stayed in the red, bringing the broader market as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index down more than 4 percent over the past six consecutive days of declines.
Much of the slump was attributed to a report from the Institute for Supply Management showing a slowdown in the nation's factories. The index registered 50.9 percent in July, down from 55.3 percent in June. A reading over 50 percent means the manufacturing sector expanded for the 24th consecutive month. Production and employment showed continued growth in July, but at slower rates than in June. However, the new orders component fell to 49.2 percent, hitting a notch below 50 percent for the first time since June, 2009, when it was 48.9 percent.
The news was particularly bad on the heels of the Friday report that the nation's gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of less than 1 percent in the first half of 2011, with the first quarter and the second quarter at 0.4 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively. The G.D.P. data was revised going back to 2003, showing the recession was deeper and the recovery weaker than originally thought.
''July's I.S.M. report was a shocker,'' said economists from Capital Economics in a research note. ''The index is not flagging up another recession, at least not yet, but it suggests that the easing in G.D.P. growth in the first half of the year is looking more and more like a sustained slowdown than a short-lived soft patch.''
Nick Kalivas, vice president for financial research at MF Global, said the weekend's debt deal developments took some risk and ''a little'' uncertainty from the market.
The deal, he said, ''kind of pushes the longer-term issues out to be taken up at another time.''
The S.& P. was down 5.34 points, or 0.41 percent, to 1,286.94. The Dow Jones industrial average was off 10.75 points, or 0.09 percent, to 12,132.49, and the Nasdaq index fell 11.77 points, or 0.43 percent, to 2,744.61.
Noting that the American stock market has performed well this year largely because of record corporate profits, James Swanson, the chief investment strategy for mutual-fund company MFS Investment Management in Boston, said that ''the economy is disappointing investors because the general assumption has been that U.S. growth would be in the twos to threes and it's clearly not.''
While bond markets may rally in response to the fact the debt ceiling crisis was averted, some analysts say the size of the agreement is likely to disappoint investors over the long term.
''Foreigners, in particular, are going to look at this deal and say, 'I thought the U.S. was capable of more than this,' '' said Zane Brown, the fixed-income strategist at Lord Abbett. ''We may find that foreign owners of U.S. Treasury securities may look for opportunities to move elsewhere.''
Another issue weighing on investors is whether America will retain its sterling credit rating.
''I think we're going to be watching for the reactions of the rating agencies,'' said G. David MacEwen, chief investment officer at mutual-fund company American Century Investments in Kansas City, Mo. Pointing to the stance of Standard and Poor's that suggested it may downgrade the country to a AA rating from a AAA if spending was not reduced by about $4 trillion, Mr. MacEwen said it was a ''big question'' whether it and the other rating agencies will be satisfied with this deal.
Noting that the manufacturing report followed ''terrible'' G.D.P. and jobs data, Matt Freund, the senior vice president of investment portfolio management for USAA Investment Management, said, ''We think it is a glass half-full economy, but it is getting harder to tell where the water line is.''
Yields have fallen as a result, he noted. The benchmark 10-year Treasury was down slightly at 2.75 percent.
In addition, there have been continued concerns about the outlook for Europe. Stefan de Schutter, an asset manager at Alpha Trading in Frankfurt, said the initial reaction in Europe to the news in the United States was one of relief but he also said European investors remained cautious.
''If we look ahead,'' he said, ''we'll see a return to the focus on the economic problems in Europe.'' The FTSE 100 in London was down 0.70 percent to 5,774.43, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.27 percent to 3,588.05, and the DAX in Frankfurt was off 2.86 percent to 6,953.98, its biggest percentage drop since March.
The key index in Japan jumped 1.3 percent, and the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong added 1 percent, picking up steam after the deal in Washington was announced by President Obama.

HEADLINE: Universal Basic Education

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Our Broken Escalator,'' by Nicholas D. Kristof (column, July 17), is a stirring call to defend and rebuild America's deteriorating education system. Study after study shows the overwhelming economic benefits of providing quality education to children, one of the many reasons the Global Campaign for Education-U.S. is working toward making universal basic education a development priority in United States foreign policy. 
Universal education is not only critical to fighting poverty, as Mr. Kristof points out, but it is also critical to forging peace.
In underdeveloped countries, every additional year of schooling reduces an adolescent boy's risk of becoming involved in conflict by 20 percent. According to one study, a country that enrolls more than 87 percent of its children in school decreases its risk of conflict by nearly 75 percent.
It is time that we make education at home and abroad the policy priority it must be if we are to mitigate the global economic crisis and ensure a more secure world.

HEADLINE: Arts Outposts Stung by Cuts in State Aid

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
For 10 years Erika Nelson, an artist in Lucas, Kan., has been making miniature models of giant pieces of Americana, putting them in a van and driving around the country to show people.
She has made tiny copies, for example, of the World's Largest Ball of Twine, which is down the road in Cawker City, and the World's Largest Can of Fruit Cocktail, which is in Sunnyvale, Calif.
She calls her mobile museum The World's Largest Collection of the World's Smallest Versions of the World's Largest Things.
But this year she may not be able to travel far. Kansas, which has one of the country's smallest state arts budgets, has decided to shrink it even further, to zero. 
''I think it's a sad day for Kansas,'' said Ms. Nelson who lost a $2,000 state grant that had helped underwrite her van's trips to colleges and county fairs.
Across the country this is a tough time for small arts groups because state grants have largely shriveled up. Thirty-one states, still staggered by the recession, cut their arts budgets for the 2012 fiscal year, which began on July 1, continuing a downturn that has seen such financial aid drop 42 percent over the last decade, according to data compiled by the National Assembly of State Arts Agencies.
The impact may hardly be felt at places like the Metropolitan Opera, established regional theaters or other large organizations that rely primarily on loyal donors and ticket revenues to underwrite their budgets.
But much of America's artistic activity does not happen in major recital halls and theaters; instead it occurs in places like Lucas, population 407, where the cultural attractions include S. P. Dinsmoor's Garden of Eden historic folk art site and where smaller arts organizations are highly dependent on state grants.
''When any form of government funding is cut, the organizations that tend to get hit the most are rural, organizations of color, avant-garde institutions -- those that have a harder time raising individual and corporate money,'' said Michael M. Kaiser, president of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington.
Nationwide, state aid represents just a small portion of the money used to underwrite the arts, perhaps 2 to 5 percent of total expenditures, according to Americans for the Arts, a lobbying group. Budgets adopted this spring in the 50 states call for a total of $259 million in spending on culture, or slightly more than the yearly spending of the Metropolitan Museum of Art alone.
The impact of state cuts is magnified, though, in smaller settings where operating margins are slender and where state money is often used to leverage other public funds or to convince private donors that an organization is worth backing.
In Kansas, for example, where a proposed budget of $689,000 was vetoed by Gov. Sam Brownback, groups like the Music Theater of Wichita stand to lose their matching funds from the National Endowment for the Arts. The endowment notified the state last month that it will not receive a planned $700,000 grant unless it puts forward a new viable state arts agency. (In May Governor Brownback fired the entire staff of the Kansas Arts Commission, which distributed the funds.)
Kansas is an extreme example. Texas, though, cut its aid to the arts by 50 percent and New Jersey by 23 percent. In Wisconsin, where state arts money was reduced by 67 percent, the Milwaukee County executive, Chris Abele, said the county could no longer afford a new sculpture planned for outside the courthouse. Four designs had been in the running, from a figure of Lady Justice to a giant wildflower.
''We're furloughing employees,'' said a county supervisor, Joe Sanfelippo. ''But we want to spend $800,000 on a sculpture? It just doesn't make sense.''
The downturn is largely a product of tough economic times, not a clash of values between conservative state governments and more liberal cultural organizations. States controlled by both Republicans and Democrats have cut grants as officials debate whether support for the arts is a core mission of government comparable to, say, road repair.
''The positioning of arts within the public policy arena has always been tenuous,'' said Bill Ivey, director of the Curb Center for Art, Enterprise and Public Policy at Vanderbilt University. ''The arts are considered an amenity -- nice to fund when you have a bit extra but hard to defend when the going gets tough.''
This year Rocco Landesman, the chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, prompted an outcry when he publicly suggested that the supply of arts organizations may have exceeded the demand. He seemed to be promoting a cultural Darwinism in which government could seed promising theaters, museums and other groups, but after that they would largely be on their own.
The ability of the endowment to help may be limited this year, with some members of Congress proposing to cut the agency's $155 million budget by $20 million. In response the National Endowment has been promoting the benefits of investing in culture, like the $278 billion in economic activity that federal research showed was spun off by the arts in 2009.
Across the country community-based arts groups typically receive small state grants funneled through regional commissions. In Kansas the Junction City Arts Council has received $10,000 a year from the state arts commission annually since 2005, money it used to provide visual arts scholarships for underprivileged children, a summer community theater program and a storyteller who performed at schools.
Gail Parsons, the council's executive director, said that to offset the state cut the council is scrambling to add fund-raising events, like selling work by local artists and staging murder-mystery dinners. ''We have to focus on the almighty dollar a lot more,'' Ms. Parsons said.
Governor Brownback has created the Kansas Arts Foundation, dedicated to private fund-raising to fill the void left by the budget cut. ''The governor campaigned last fall on returning the state to core responsibilities such as education and public safety,'' said Sherriene Jones-Sontag, a spokeswoman for Mr. Brownback. ''He believes that the arts should be privately funded.''
Recently he sent a letter to citizens urging them to contribute to the foundation. ''I have no doubt that the arts will continue to thrive through private donations,'' he wrote.
Rosslyn Schultz, the executive director of the Grassroots Art Center in Lucas, said via e-mail that she thought it was incredible that the governor, having just cut $4,300 from the council's $78,000 operating budget, was looking for donations.
''Really,'' she asked, ''are you kidding, Governor Brownback?''
Established arts institutions often find it easier to secure government assistance because they are prestigious and have board members with political clout. Smaller programs that may rely more on grant money can have a harder time because their work -- and its impact -- is not as well known.
Ms. Nelson of the mobile museum says she will have difficulty competing for contributions. ''Everybody is reaching out to private donors now,'' she said.
In addition to the $2,000 grant she will not receive, Ms. Nelson anticipates she will lose additional revenue because groups that hire her to run programs are themselves heavily dependent on state funds. As a result she is planning to drop her operating budget to $3,000 from about $12,000 and reduce her travel.
''People are saying that Kansas doesn't appreciate the arts,'' she said. ''But there are so many of us out here who do and struggle on a daily basis to give arts to people who can't afford to pay $90 for a symphony seat.''

HEADLINE: A Rift Divides Members Of Journalism Groups

BYLINE: By TANZINA VEGA

 BODY:
As the National Association of Black Journalists opens its annual conference in Philadelphia on Wednesday, a topic of conversation is likely to be its recent efforts to get more black anchors on prime-time news programs.
But another issue may form a larger backdrop -- the association's decision to end its alliance with three other minority journalist groups after nearly 20 years.
The rift between N.A.B.J. and the Unity: Journalists of Color coalition comes as the number of minorities in newsrooms across the country has declined for the third consecutive year.
When the association joined Unity in the early 1990s, its goal -- along with the other members, the National Association of Hispanic Journalists, the Asian American Journalists Association and the Native American Journalists Association -- was to make newsrooms and reporting more inclusive. The highlight of the alliance is the Unity: Journalists of Color conference, which brings the groups together every four years. 
This year, a debate erupted between board members from N.A.B.J. and Unity over how much revenue N.A.B.J. and other member organizations should receive as a result of the conference. N.A.B.J. members also questioned the need for Unity as a stand-alone organization and whether it was using its revenue to effectively support minority journalists.
Unable to reach an agreement, N.A.B.J. withdrew from the 2012 Unity conference in April and announced last week that it would hold its own conference in New Orleans in June. That decision has left some N.A.B.J. members divided over how and why it was made and what they will do next year.
''I know that there are issues, but be that as it may, it seems to me that this is not the time to walk away from being a united front,'' said Callie Crossley, an N.A.B.J. member, seminar program manager at the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard and the host of ''The Callie Crossley Show'' on WGBH radio. ''To me it's not clear how we come out better in the financial end.''
''I'm deeply disappointed that what we worked so hard to put together is coming apart,'' said Walt Swanston, a diversity consultant and former executive director of N.A.B.J. from 1993 to 1994 and for Unity from 1997 to 1998.
Lynne K. Adrine, an N.A.B.J. member and the director of the graduate program for broadcast and digital journalism at the S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University, said she was disappointed that N.A.B.J. had pulled out of the Unity conference. But she said she understood that the organization had to ''exercise a certain amount of fiscal responsibility, especially during these trying financial times.''
N.A.B.J. representatives have responded to their members' concerns by explaining that by leaving Unity, the group will keep its sponsorships secure and continue to earn money on its own that can be put toward programming for its members.
''We expected people to feel torn about it,'' said Kathy Y. Times, the president of N.A.B.J. ''At the end of the day, the board is an elected body and weighed months of negotiations to make sure that N.A.B.J. was meeting the needs of our members.''
Like other member organizations, N.A.B.J. has struggled over the last decade to balance its support of annual conferences and professional enrichment programs with a decline in financial support from media companies suffering from sharp advertising losses. In 2001, as part of an effort to broaden its sponsorship base, the group lifted a long-held ban on financing from the makers of alcoholic beverages and began accepting more nonmedia sponsors.
Maurice Foster, the executive director of N.A.B.J., said the group had been in contact with convention sponsors who said they would support the N.A.B.J. conference in 2012. Many sponsors considered the Unity conference ''a matter of convenience,'' Mr. Foster said, since it allowed them to reach many organizations in one location. ''Every other year, they were prepared to go to four places,'' he added.
Unity representatives, however, said the alliance continued to play a critical role in representing minority journalists. Onica Makwakwa, the executive director for Unity, said the coalition earned nearly $1 million during the 2008 convention, has since conducted multiple research projects and supported public policy issues affecting minorities.
Even in the absence of N.A.B.J., Ms. Makwakwa said the alliance would move forward. ''We expect to have a successful convention with three alliance partners as opposed to four,'' she said.
According to the American Society of News Editors, the number of professional journalists working in newsrooms across the United States increased to 41,600 in 2010, from 41,500 in 2009, but the numbers of journalists of color in newsrooms across the country has declined for the last three years to 5,300 from 5,500.
''At a time when the U.S. Census shows that minorities are 36 percent of the U.S. population, newsrooms are going in the opposite direction,'' Milton Coleman, the president of American Society of News Editors, said in a statement.
Since the first Unity conference was held in Atlanta in 1994, a major draw has been its job fair, which typically attracts dozens of media companies looking to recruit minority job candidates. With the split, those companies will be left to decide whether to send representatives to both conferences in 2012, or choose just one.
Johnita Due, assistant general counsel and diversity council chairwoman at CNN, said in an e-mail that the network is focused on this year's convention season but, ''we would have hoped that, for the greater good of our common diversity goals, the differences among Unity groups could have been resolved with N.A.B.J. making the decision to stay within the Unity umbrella.'' (CNN last month was criticized by N.A.B.J. for announcing a new prime-time lineup that included no journalists of color.)
The New York Times said it would not support the N.A.B.J. conference in 2012 and instead would attend Unity.
''While we understand that N.A.B.J. has some real concerns about the direction Unity is going and about its finances, this is a time when they should be working even harder with Unity instead of separating from the organization,'' said Dana Canedy, a senior editor at The Times. (In July, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., chairman and publisher of The Times, endorsed Gregory H. Lee Jr. for N.A.B.J. president. Mr. Lee, a senior assistant sports editor at The Boston Globe, which is owned by The Times, supported the N.A.B.J. withdrawal from Unity.)
The financial pressures that newsrooms face also could affect the number of journalists that are able to attend the conferences since many media companies have traditionally paid the bill for their employees, including the cost of airfare and hotel.
''The dollars become essential,'' said Kenneth F. Irby, a senior faculty member at the Poynter Institute and a member of N.A.B.J. and N.A.H.J. Tough economic times are causing many media organizations to suffer ''diversity fatigue'' where layoffs and tight budgets have meant taking a ''last hired, first fired approach,'' and minority journalists are suffering from that, Mr. Irby said.

HEADLINE: After Military Leaders Quit, Turks Question Power Of Prime Minister

BYLINE: By ANTHONY SHADID

 BODY:
SILIVRI, Turkey -- The retired men in this town of rolling hills, red shingles and resentment of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan paused their card game to voice their fears over the protest resignations of most of Turkey's military command, an event that underlined Mr. Erdogan's stamp on an era he can call his own.
''He finished the army,'' said Rait Kurt, sitting at a table flanked by pictures of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey, whose principles the military has long said it upholds.
''Our biggest protector is the army,'' added a friend, Ozdemir Elmas. 
''Who shall we trust now?'' Kurt asked rhetorically. ''Who?''
The resignations last week of Turkey's top commander, along with heads of the navy, army and air force, seemed for many to bring symbolically to a close the gravest danger to civilian rule here -- the penchant for a military to act above the law, as it did in carrying out three coups since 1960 and forcing another government from power in 1997. But to Mr. Erdogan's critics, particularly among the secular elite, the move demonstrated his ability to exercise control over the country's key institutions, with the military falling to a relentless crackdown waged by the judiciary on its top ranks.
In Silivri, a town known for its sunflowers and the sprawling prison painted in pastels where some of those officers are being tried, the sentiments are as relentless as the sun on the Sea of Marmara's beaches, a few minutes away. Heard often in this town of 44,000 an hour's drive from Istanbul are the fears of his opponents, a political minority, that no one protects them in a country that Mr. Erdogan has governed for eight years.
Ersin Pamuk gestured in the direction of the Silivri Prison, ringed with coils of barbed wire and newly planted pine trees, where one of the military trials is being held.
''If we say anything, they'll put us there!'' he said, laughing.
As he and his family lounged on a narrow beach, he turned more serious.
''Of course, he's already strong and now he's becoming stronger,'' he said of Mr. Erdogan. ''They're drawing the circle tighter and tighter around us, step by step, and then we're going to look like Iraq or Iran. No one can challenge his power anymore.''
Since winning its first election in 2002, Mr. Erdogan's Justice and Development Party has overseen a transformation of this country of 73 million, one that is not without detractors. Turkey has emerged as a decisive power in a region long dominated by the United States. Its economy, while still dogged by unemployment, is booming, powered by an insurgent capitalist class that springs from the conservative constituencies in the Anatolian hinterland that Mr. Erdogan, a populist and charismatic figure, has courted.
But even as Turkey becomes more modern and more relevant to the region around it, the old fissures persist, those cleavages of conservative and liberal, nationalist and Islamist, religious and secular. In conversations here, there was a fear that Mr. Erdogan has shifted power decisively away from them. Fear, in fact, seemed to be the driving principle of their opposition: It was less what Mr. Erdogan, a 57-year-old former mayor of Istanbul, had done and more what he might do.
''We're going toward darkness,'' said Battal Sunar, a 58-year-old retiree, relaxing with his family on the beach. ''We're going backwards toward the Ottoman era.''
His wife, Inci, nodded.
''We are really, really worried about our lifestyle,'' she said.
Mr. Sunar's family and others traded stories about the military officer in their building growing more religious, municipal officials trying to curb drinking alcohol in the streets of Istanbul and a foreign policy in the capital, Ankara, which looks more eastward, to the Middle East, than west, to Europe. The foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, once quoted an Ottoman decree in a speech, an occasion that seemed a metaphor for re-engaging an Ottoman past from which modern Turkey had long sought to distance itself.
But even many of Mr. Erdogan's critics acknowledge that a suspected religious agenda of his party, pious and conservative as it is, has not come to pass. Fear seems more an anxiety over the electoral prowess of the party, and Mr. Erdogan at its center, which represents a coalition of the conservative, disenfranchised and newly wealthy that may keep it in power for years to come. That success has given it unprecedented leverage over the state's institutions -- the courts, universities, news media and, now, the military.
''These people will never go away,'' said Mr. Sunar's daughter, Sevda. ''They work hard, they're smart, they're well organized and they will bring their own system.''
There are still signs in Turkey that even the old divisions are becoming less important. The party that long acted as the standard-bearer for Mr. Ataturk, who established the modern Turkish state in 1923, now tries to avoid debates over the religious and the secular. Despite its history of fierce nationalism, it has tentatively reached out to the repressed Kurdish minority, who live predominantly in southeastern Turkey.
Polling last year by Iksara, a local firm, found evidence of those old identities being blurred, especially among youth. A third of young people who supported Mr. Erdogan offered Kemalism, the secular ideology of Mr. Ataturk, as one of their identities. About 15 percent of supporters for his chief rival listed Islamist as one of their identities.
Even in Silivri, lines were occasionally crossed. A butcher named Ayhan Yaman, who voted for the main opposition party in elections in June, celebrated what he called Mr. Erdogan's authoritarianism. He meant it as a compliment.
''You need someone to punch the table and shake it,'' he said. ''In the past journalists or the military could topple leaders. No one can do anything to him.''
That process of bridging divisions, though, feels tentative, and the fears delivered by the retired men at the tea shop in Silivri were far more common. They were born soon after Mr. Ataturk built the state. In their autumn, they watched as it was transformed.
''We can't trust the army, we can't trust the mosque, we can trust the police,'' Mr. Kurt said. ''Who should we trust? Who? You have to trust someone.''
''The prime minister should be for everyone, for all of us,'' said another friend, Muharrem Yuksel. ''But they don't treat everyone equally. They're not impartial at all.''
He paused for a moment, then spoke again.
''We hope God will help us,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A Worker With No ID and Great Medical Need

BYLINE: By SANJAY BASU, M.D.. 
Dr. Sanjay Basu is a resident in internal medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. This essay was written as part of the university's Partnership for Physician Advocacy Skills program.

 BODY:
In San Francisco, where bicycle commuters often wear full-body spandex suits, my patient Carlos could easily be spotted: the Mexican man in mustard-colored work boots and painter's overalls stained with gear grease, furiously pedaling an adolescent's red Huffy.
He was the only patient I've ever had who rode a bike to his medical appointments, making his way from the docks under the Bay Bridge to our roving clinic about three miles across town. Our clinic for uninsured patients like Carlos was actually a converted cargo van that drove the back alleys of the city, stopping behind big-box stores and beneath bridges to repair cuts and scrapes among the city's homeless population. 
We saw Carlos arrive in the van's rear-view mirror. He would pant while locking his bike to the bumper, then wipe sweat off his upper lip and compose himself, extending a firm handshake to our nurse. I saw him so often with his helmet on that it was not until our third visit that I realized he was nearly bald.
What I had noticed, though, was a growth the size of a golf ball emerging above his left clavicle that had begun to press on his airway, causing him to wheeze. ''I come here as fast as I can,'' he would say every time, apologizing for how long it took to ascend San Francisco's hills.
Carlos propped himself up on the exam table in the back of the van as our nurse rushed back and forth between the steering wheel and the filing cabinets of medical paperwork chained to the walls. In a normal doctor's office, each of Carlos's visits would have been carefully documented in a folder labeled with his last name in block letters, slipped into a wall of manila patient records.
But here, we stapled the sheets together and slid them into an envelope at the back of a cabinet labeled ''Undocumented.''
Unlike most of our other patients, Carlos didn't have any identification. He gladly paid out of pocket for ointments and creams for incidental cuts and bruises. But what he really needed was a biopsy, a $200 procedure that, given the location of the mass in his neck, could not be done safely in the back of a van.
We could find no medical office willing to schedule an appointment for a man without identification. One private hospital sent us a typed note: ''This unfortunate gentleman will not be eligible for services here.''
We told Carlos to go to the emergency room of the public hospital, San Francisco General. He was not yet sick enough to be formally admitted, though, so he sat on a gurney for six hours and was charged $1,085 for a bag of intravenous salt water he didn't really need. He was passed a note instructing him to ''follow up with your primary care provider.''
The hospital eventually gave him an appointment for a biopsy; it was scheduled in five months and three weeks. Carlos kept the yellow appointment slip in the front pocket of his overalls. He would bike with it; his sweat stained the paper until the edges wore thin.
''I will not miss this,'' he said whenever we reminded him of the date. As a temporizing show of support before his biopsy, we would see him every Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. He would roll in, wheezing, but would smile after a brief breathing treatment or 15 minutes with a heating pad on his shoulder.
During those early weeks of September, the health care debates raged on television. We watched as President Obama told Congress that illegal immigrants would not get health care coverage. We heard someone yell, ''You lie!''
On any given day, the bodies of illegal immigrants lie in San Francisco's coroner's office, found by police or firefighters in alleys or on sidewalks, unclaimed and unnamed.
Before they died, their medical costs may well have been passed on to taxpayers. But it's also true that many were taxpayers themselves. From 2000 to 2005, illegal immigrant workers paid an estimated $6 billion to $7 billion in Social Security taxes and about $1.5 billion to Medicare, according to the Social Security Administration. And the president's Council of Economic Advisers has estimated that illegal immigrants pay $80,000 more in taxes per person than they consume in government benefits over their lifetimes.
The question of whether to insure Carlos and others like him is really a decision about whether to pay now or later -- that is, to pay for preventive medical care now, or to pay in the future for hospital and emergency services, or for the internment of unclaimed bodies.
Carlos stopped coming to his appointments. Our driver would wait an extra 30 minutes for him to reappear, brushing off demands from traffic cops to make way for the evening restaurant crowd. Weeks passed. Carlos's friends from the docks approached the van, wondering if we had seen him.
Early one morning, a clerk at the public hospital handed me a message. Carlos's red bike had turned up at a police auction. Sold, for $32.
I fear the growth in his throat may have been cancer, that it may have killed him. The coroner's office cannot tell us, but it would not be that surprising, really. At the age of 50, Carlos already had surpassed by an entire year the average life expectancy of a migrant laborer in the United States.

HEADLINE: Wary State and Local Lawmakers Try to Gauge Impact of Deficit Deal

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY and MICHAEL COOPER; Adam Nagourney reported from Los Angeles, and Michael Cooper from New York. Reporting was contributed by Kirk Johnson from Denver; A. G. Sulzberger from Jackson, Wyo.; Kim Severson and Robbie Brown from Atlanta; Ian Lovett from Los Angeles; Malia Wollan from San Francisco; and Catrin Einhorn from New York.

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- The deficit reduction deal reached in Washington produced some relief across the country on Monday, as the nation appeared to have avoided default. But it also produced a sharp wave of anxiety among governors and mayors worried about how the cuts might hurt already beleaguered states and cities, and it sowed anger and cynicism among many Americans about leaders in Washington.
Few people -- from government officials struggling to figure out the details of a moving target to Americans appalled at the partisan drama -- seemed surprised that a deal had been reached at the last moment. But it came at what appears to be a high cost. 
''This has eroded my faith in government, because there was such a high when Obama came in,'' said Meredith Quill, 38, who lives in Los Angeles.
In Atlanta, Kathy Ashe, a Democratic state representative, said that the fight had undermined her belief in Washington's basic competence. ''It is no longer about the best and brightest minds steering the nation based on the best information available,'' she said.
Mayors, governors and state lawmakers spent Monday trying to measure how much the deficit deal might cost them in aid, a frustrating task given the fact that many of the details of the reductions in federal spending will not be known until later in the year. But there was no doubt that local governments, many of which have endured several years of brutal budget cuts, were facing even more tough times ahead.
''Had they not reached a deal, the credit of everybody -- from credit cards to the bonds that cities float -- would have been impacted,'' said Jean Quan, the mayor of Oakland, Calif.
But she said she was very concerned by the deal's call for more than $2 trillion in cuts over the next decade. ''It's often poor people, the young and the elderly that get the short end of the stick,'' she said. ''Somehow I don't think the Defense Department is going to suffer as much.''
Mayor John R. Marks III of Tallahassee, Fla., said he was relieved that default had apparently been averted, even as he girded for another round of budget cuts.
''There's no question it's going to come down to the cities,'' he said. ''I think we're all going to feel some pain as we go forward, but I think, as everybody believes, we must do these kind of things to get the deficit under control.''
Ron Downey, a county commissioner in rural Montana, said he was frustrated that the federal spending cuts had not been deeper. But he said he was heartened that Washington was finally reducing the debt.
''We've gained a lot over the last year,'' said Mr. Downey, a Republican. ''Instead of talking about more stimulus, at least we're going the other way and talking about saving. I think it's the right direction. I just wish they'd done more.''
But states did see one hopeful sign. While the deal calls for a series of large automatic spending cuts in the coming years if Congress fails to agree on how to trim the budget deficit, it exempts Medicaid -- the program that is perhaps the single most important stream of federal spending for states -- from those automatic cuts.
Much of the uncertainty stems from the mechanics of the deal itself. The deal requires a new committee of members of Congress to meet this fall to try to come up with ways to reduce the deficit by $1.5 trillion. If they fail, the deal calls for $1.2 trillion in automatic budget cuts, divided between military and domestic spending but leaving Social Security and Medicaid alone. Economists, and politicians, are divided in how they see the likely outcome of this proposal for a deficit-cutting committee, backed by the threat of automatic cuts.
''Now that that bullet has been dodged, we've got to work just as hard to make sure we understand the impact of this deal and where these cuts are coming from,'' said Gov. Jack Markell of Delaware, a Democrat. ''We've got to make sure that the folks in Washington understand that if it's just essentially a shift of these expenses from the federal government to the state governments and state taxpayers, that doesn't really achieve anything.''
Across the country, the disdain for the process was not universal. Some people said they had simply tuned out or ignored what was happening, having long ago given up on Washington.
''To tell you the truth,'' Owen Jones, 26, said while tending bar at a hotel in Jackson, Wyo., ''more people were talking about whether the N.F.L. would have a season.''
Still, the displeasure was powerful and crossed party lines. ''We do need to get this spending under control,'' said Brad Taylor, a management consultant in the Denver suburb of Aurora, who described himself as politically independent. ''That being said, playing games that take us right on up to the 11th hour -- it turned into a spitting contest that the rest of us could do without.''
Tom Friedlander, who lives in Los Angeles, described the process as ridiculous. ''My opinion of American government was already low as it was, but now it just seems petty,'' he said. ''Really, it seems like we have a bunch of people who are adults who aren't acting like adults.''
In Georgia, Cameron Fash, the chairman of the Georgia Young Republicans, described the whole process as frustrating, saying, ''This is something that should have been handled months ago, not days and hours before the deadline.''
Yet through it all, there was a sense that a deal was inevitable because the alternative was so dire. Don Ronyak, a human resources supervisor for Denver, said it was that confidence that allowed him to avoid panic about his savings and investments as the stock market swooned. ''I just waited it out,'' he said.
Heading to the airport in Denver, Marc A. Miller, a pilot for Southwest Airlines, said he never doubted that a deal would be reached, no matter how sharp the partisan differences. ''No one is that incompetent,'' he said. ''You had to accomplish something, otherwise you were going to cripple the markets, which would cripple the country.''

HEADLINE: Review Aims to Avert Cheating on State Tests

BYLINE: By SHARON OTTERMAN

 BODY:
New York State education officials announced Monday that they had begun to review the way they detect and prevent cheating on standardized tests, taking a step to avoid the cheating scandals that have engulfed school systems in other states. 
New York does not conduct statistical analyses of its high-stakes third- through eighth-grade tests to scour for suspicious results that could signal cheating, like unusual spikes in a school's scores or predictable erasures on multiple-choice questions, officials said.
Analyses in Atlanta and Philadelphia, among other cities, have produced evidence of tampering on a scale that calls into question those cities' educational achievements.
The State Education Department released a brief statement on Monday saying that the education commissioner, John B. King Jr., had convened a high-level working group in mid-July to begin an immediate review of ''all aspects of the state's testing system.'' Officials said details would be available soon.
The group, headed by Valerie Grey, the executive deputy commissioner, will make recommendations to districts that will ensure ''the integrity of our testing system before our students return to school in September,'' though it may continue making recommendations after the school year starts. Schools are due to get the results of the 2011 third- through eighth-grade tests this week.
''We are in a period now where I believe the results of state testing systems around the country are coming under scrutiny,'' Merryl H. Tisch, the commissioner of the State Board of Regents, said in an interview, adding that the state was acting to shore up public trust in its tests.
One hurdle, she said, was technological: the state's testing systems are not designed to send computerized versions of results for easy comparison. But the state has hired a new testing company, Pearson, to develop its middle and elementary school tests beginning next year, and ''the next iteration of test production will add technology to the system to make these types of studies much easier,'' she said.
While New York City conducts investigations when questions about results are raised at a particular school, the city's Education Department does not look systemwide for suspicious patterns on the tests. Those tests are the primary way the city judges the performance of elementary and middle schools on its annual school report cards. Before Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg won control of the schools, the city did conduct erasure analyses, but they were stopped by the Board of Education because of concerns about cost and effectiveness, city officials said.
On the state tests for high school students known as Regents exams, an analysis by The New York Times found a suspicious spike in the number of students who scored just over the passing bar, a statistically improbable result. The city has begun to audit those exams, and the state has changed a policy that had required teachers to re-grade Regents tests of students who came close to passing.
On the elementary and middle school tests, however, the main concern of policy makers has been score inflation, not cheating. Acknowledging that the tests had become too easy to pass, the state adjusted scoring last year, causing hundreds of thousands of additional children to fall below proficiency.

HEADLINE: Airport Experience Now Includes Shopping for the Whole Family

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
After visits to malls plummeted during the recession -- and have yet to bounce back -- many mass-market retailers stepped up their search for other locations to lure shoppers.
Places where people might be bored. And unable to leave. One time-tested answer: airports.
While luxury stores set up shops in airports long ago to attract duty-free international shoppers, retailing in many domestic terminals was limited to newsstands and the occasional shop selling coffee mugs and local smoked meat. The real diversity in airport shopping was in the food concessions.
No more. 
''Airports are becoming, really, a service facility, like a shopping mall,'' said Jose Gomez, senior vice president for business development for Mango, the fashion retailer.
While clothing and specialty luggage and electronics stores aimed at male shoppers -- like Johnston & Murphy, Brooks Brothers and Brookstone -- have been fixtures at airports, the new wave of stores moves beyond the businessman traveler to include teenagers, women and bargain shoppers.
Mango recently opened two stores at San Francisco International Airport. It will open one in the Orlando airport this fall and plans more airport locations in the next two years. Victoria's Secret opened seven airport stores in 2010 and 2011.
Muji, a Japanese housewares and apparel store, has opened two airport locations, and Sean John, the clothing line by Sean Combs, a k a Diddy or P. Diddy, has a store in Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, which has grown from ''news and gift and generic concepts'' to ''almost complete retail diversity'' over the last 10 years, said Paul Brown, director of concessions at the airport.
Even Brooks Brothers -- which was one of the first clothing stores to expand into airports, opening its first airport store in 1999 -- is riding the wave, with plans to add about five stores a year to the 26 it already has in the United States. And overseas, the fashion retailers H&M and Zara have each opened several airport stores.
The draw of the airport location is simple: an attentive clientele. ''After security, you're locked up,'' Mr. Gomez of Mango said.
Domestic travelers spend more than an hour, on average, waiting in airports once they have passed security, said Gerry Cecci, vice president for airport management at the Westfield Group the mall company, which manages retail sites at airports including Boston, Newark and Miami.
''Someone may have a street concept or a mall concept that's very successful, and bringing it to the airport environment, you capitalize on the captive audience and on the dwell time,'' Mr. Cecci said.
Retailers say that sales per square foot are higher at airports than they are in mall or street locations -- especially when it is raining or snowing and flights are delayed.
''We have a motto -- bad weather is good for business,'' said Paulette Garafalo, president for wholesale, international and marketing at Brooks Brothers. ''Whenever there's bad weather, we enjoy a hearty day. It's the polar opposite of retail here.''
Making money in retailing at the airport, though, requires some adjustments to the traditional sales model. Stores are smaller, and the customers are often rushed, or at least very time-conscious. A premium is placed on convenience.
''Though there is a dressing room where you can try on dresses, maybe people are not so much inclined to try on, because they don't have a lot of time,'' Mr. Gomez of Mango said. ''So accessories and tops sell better.''
Retailers also have to alter the layout of stores. Aisles have to be wide enough for luggage, and the pristine storefront displays used in malls often have to be tossed aside in favor of more open concepts and the stacking of merchandise at the store's entrance.
''They figure out that removing the plate window glass and opening up is turning out to be a great idea,'' said Mr. Brown of the Atlanta airport.
Many airport stores, including the Brooks Brothers outlets, are operated by specialists in airport concessions, the Paradies Shops. The company also run newsstands and other airport stores.The Brooks Brothers airport stores are geared toward business travelers and are stocked with ''items they've forgotten, or items they know they need,'' Ms. Garafalo said. ''We have business travelers that plan their shopping knowing if they go through a certain hub several times a week.''
The retail push in airports has been welcome by most airports as they try to build revenue not dependent on airlines.
''The relationship between the airport and the airline has changed dramatically, in that the airport can't just put its costs on the airlines,'' said Paul McGinn, the president of MarketPlace Development, which manages and leases retail space at the Philadelphia International Airport and La Guardia. ''Airports have to be self-sustaining,'' he said, and retail ''has become a valuable source of revenue.''
At large airports, while airlines contribute the most to revenue, at about 41 percent, retailing (including food) is the second-biggest source of revenue, at 19 percent, according to the aviation industry consultants MAC Consulting and Intervistas. (Rental car and parking make up the other parts.)
In the old days, retail space was added to the airport layout after the rest of the terminal was designed, but as the retail trend accelerated over the last decade, airports are including store-friendly elements like appealing concourse layouts, loading docks and storage facilities in new terminals, airport executives and consultants said.
Rents at airports are generally higher than in malls -- it is street pricing plus 10 percent at most sites in the Atlanta airport, for instance, Mr. Brown said. Demand for airport space is also high -- the vacancy rate at airports is now just 5.4 percent, down from 8.2 percent a year ago, according to CoStar Group, a real estate research firm. Over all, the retail vacancy rate is 7.1 percent, CoStar said.
Mr. McGinn said that at airports, however cranky travelers might be, they were also willing to buy.
''The experience of traveling tends to put people in a mode that they're prepared to spend money,'' he said, whether it is because they are on vacation or charging to expense accounts.
And, he said, he suspected there was another element at play that explained the armfuls of smoked salmon or I NY hats, or now, Victoria's Secret scanties and Mango T-shirts that travelers present to their families upon returning home.
''It is also a venue where, and this is always a funny thing to talk about, but there's an awful lot of people that are motivated by guilt,'' he said. ''That certainly inspires a lot of sales.''

HEADLINE: Buy This Apartment, and Get a Used Car Absolutely Free!

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
The offers crop up in listings and advertisements everywhere: Closing costs covered! A vintage car for the weekend! Money for summer camp!
Across New York City, sellers of luxury apartments -- or at least those with a little gloss -- have been whipping themselves to a froth finding the extravagant freebies that will say just the right things about their properties and, by extension, the life habits of the people who would live there.
In certain markets, the gift can be a car. One Brooklyn Bridge Park offered Audis to anyone spending more than $2 million on an apartment, while Windows on 123 in Harlem promised a Smart Car with the purchase of a $65,000 parking spot. 
But, perhaps more in keeping with these fragile and uncertain economic times, along the humble byways of Kensington, Brooklyn, a man named Gary Parker is offering a more budget-minded incentive to buy his tidy one-bedroom co-op. It, too, is a car, but one befitting a more down-market lifestyle: a claret-colored 2002 Hyundai Elantra, a hand-me-down from his mother that has more than been around the block, its odometer clocking in at some 79,000 miles.
''Maybe I should be selling the car as being souped-up with an apartment,'' Mr. Parker said, laughing. ''She's got a few beauty marks, but she's been good to me.''
Mr. Parker, deputy director of the McSilver Institute for Poverty Policy and Research at New York University, has lived in Brooklyn for years, but with a recent job switch he wanted to be closer to work and to finally have the experience of living in Manhattan after more than 20 years in New York. Putting his co-op on the market and deciding he would move to Hell's Kitchen, he realized he would not need the Hyundai anymore.
At first, he considered donating the car, which has a Kelley Blue Book value of about $4,300, to charity, but then his sister suggested he throw it in along with the apartment. ''I thought, 'What a nice thank you gift that would be.' ''
When Mr. Parker asked his real estate agent, Scott Klein of Prudential Douglas Elliman, if he thought it would be a selling point, Mr. Klein said, ''Well, it certainly would be different.''
In 11 years of selling apartments, he said, he had not run across another that came with a car. Promotions of one sort or another are commonplace, he said, although more frequently the incentives are between brokers, with the listing agent promising a gift to whoever brings in the buyer.
An agent at Corcoran recently offered a free iPad, Mr. Klein said. Last year, a broker promised a pair of tickets to the World Cup soccer final to the agent who brokered a fully executed contract at the Centurion, a condominium on West 56th Street.
''It's all a calculation,'' Mr. Klein said, recalling the $1,000 American Express gift cards Stuyvesant Town offered for recruiting new tenants. ''But, hey, marketing is important. People buy things because of the way they're marketed.''
Mr. Klein said that he doubted anyone would buy the apartment for the car, but that it could be a positive, especially for someone moving from Manhattan. (The Web listing for the apartment mentions a free car, but not what kind.)
The apartment, in an early-1960s white brick building with a semicircular driveway and an arching, peaked awning on Ocean Parkway, is listed for $298,000 and also comes with the right to rent, for $100 a month, the designated parking space where the car now resides. In some ways, that spot is as much a draw as the car. It is in a lot, right under a light and security camera, visible from Mr. Parker's 11th-floor window beneath a view that sweeps across Brooklyn, Staten Island and Lower Manhattan and so close that Mr. Parker can use the automatic starter on his key chain to get the engine, along with the heat or air-conditioning, going from his living room.
Looking out the windows, which face southwest and the sunset, Mr. Parker questioned whether he should sell at all. ''I have moments where I'm like, 'What are you doing?' ''
He said he liked the quiet of the neighborhood, and the location, which is close to a cluster of well-regarded restaurants on Cortelyou Road. If he were married, he said, he would probably stay.
Mr. Klein said the apartment, which has been on the market about a month, had attracted some interest, but no offers. As for the car, Mr. Parker said he would miss it -- he has used it mainly for quick trips to the grocery store and dry cleaner, as well as weekend getaways to Jones Beach or Sandy Hook or Fire Island. But from Manhattan, he said, he would be able to walk to the Port Authority Bus Terminal and catch a ride wherever he might want to go.
''But I'll tell you what I'm going to miss about this car,'' he said. ''It has a cassette player in it, and I have some mix tapes that I've made over the years that I'm not going to be able to listen to anymore. I'm going to really miss that cassette player.''

HEADLINE: A Bare Market Lasts One Morning

BYLINE: By MELENA RYZIK

 BODY:
It was an early Monday morning like any other on Wall Street. Before most of the blue-shirted financiers descended, there came an army of helpers: the custodians and coffee fetchers, personal trainers and headsetted assistants who make the money street run smoothly. They marched along the sidewalks, in a hurry to start their workweek.
Here and there, though, a few people were slowing down, like the trader barking into his cellphone in the calm before the market opened. He paused to loosen his tie. Unbutton his shirt. Take off his pants.
''He's buck-naked -- Lord have mercy!'' a woman said, stopping to gawk at, loudly judge and then photograph a sudden expanse of flesh. 
Seconds after 7 a.m. on Monday, trousers were dropping and skirts were lifting all along Wall Street. The mass dishabille was part of a site-specific work of performance art, ''Ocularpation: Wall Street,'' by an artist, Zefrey Throwell. It was intended as a commentary on work and the economy, Mr. Throwell said, though that seemed to be lost on the police stationed near the New York Stock Exchange.
There, three people -- two men and a woman dressed (briefly) as a stock trader, a janitor and a dog-walker -- were arrested and taken to a nearby precinct, where they were given summons for disorderly conduct and later released. By 7:05 a.m., the remaining 46 men and women who were part of the project had simply put their clothes back on and gone about their day. Mr. Throwell, who also participated -- he was dressed, then undressed, as a hot dog vendor -- pronounced the artwork a success and went off to the precinct to see about his compatriots.
''It's like a Fluxus happening -- it's sort of jaw-dropping, it's this moment, and it's never going to happen again,'' said Argot Murelius, a 43-year-old art writer who participated, her black lace lingerie peeking out from beneath her pink sweatsuit. (Her role in the piece: prostitute.)
For Mr. Throwell, 35, the moment has been a long time coming. Over coffee in Bryant Park last week, he explained his project. It was ''an educational attempt,'' he said, ''to lend more transparency to Wall Street, a street which is so damn mysterious.'' Drawing on the common fear of appearing in public naked, he hoped to create ''an absurdist Freudian nightmare'' of nude employment: ''Wall Street, exposed,'' as he put it.
The idea came to him after conversations with his mother, Jan Elliott, who retired as a high school counselor in Corvallis, Ore., only to see her nest egg disappear in the financial crisis of 2008; she was forced to re-enter the labor force to survive. Around the same time, Mr. Throwell was eking out a living in a cubicle for the first time, as a customs broker in San Francisco: ''One of the most Kafkaesque jobs I've ever had,'' he said, ''like entering the void for eight hours at a time. It was horrible. I'd never been enslaved by labor before.''
For an earlier, one-man iteration of ''Ocularpation,'' Mr. Throwell sat naked behind a desk in the financial district of San Francisco for 10 minutes, part of a series of works questioning business and consumer culture. The authorities there barely batted an eye. He moved to New York in 2008, where his projects have led to detainment and once to arrest, he said -- not surprising, perhaps, for an artist who considers the absurdist comedian Andy Kaufman a prime inspiration.
Mr. Throwell, an admirer of the performance group Improv Everywhere, has also staged an office worker olympics in Midtown Manhattan, with events like the 50-meter swim (held in a fountain). For ''New York City Paints Better Than Me,'' he donned a white jumpsuit and crawled the streets, becoming a canvas for a composition of trash and slime.
Mr. Throwell studied painting but supports himself as a photographer and filmmaker; he also runs Engineer's Office, a very small gallery -- it's 6 feet high, 2 feet wide and 2 feet deep, in a decommissioned water fountain nook -- in the basement of Rockefeller Center. ''Nothing is for sale,'' he said, ''and it all gets thrown away by a janitor at some undetermined time.''
Though Mr. Throwell wants to push boundaries creatively, he said he does not set out to flout laws with his work. ''I see it operating paralegally, alongside the law, in many cases,'' he said. ''It's not necessarily illegal to give people 100 air horns and conduct a symphony in the streets and use the building as the resonator. It's more paralegal, a gray area.''
For ''Ocularpation'' he was given use of a work space at 14 Wall Street through a program sponsored by the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council. Aside from the residency, ''L.M.C.C. did not provide any financial grants or support for the production of 'Ocularpation: Wall Street,' '' a council spokesman said. Being there allowed Mr. Throwell to canvass the area; his nonscientific survey revealed a labor force at odds with what people might expect.
''Kids in Calcutta and kids in Tulsa right now are talking about Wall Street, but they have never been there, and don't know that there's a Tiffany's,'' he said, or ''that there's more sandwich shops than banks, that there's more gyms happening there than stock trading.'' Demystifiying the street, he said he felt, was one step in educating people about the interconnected financial realities and critiquing the system.
Casting was not a problem. Mr. Throwell first put out a call to artist friends, ''and I found an organization that I love very much now, called the Young Naturists and Nudists of New York City,'' he said. ''They're a fun-loving bunch.'' (Asked why he chose to stage the project now, he answered, ''Because it's warm.'')
Roger Gindi, 59, a member of the Young Naturists group, played the part of a janitor in ''Ocularpation.'' Wearing only a yellow sweatband, he carefully mopped a section of the street. ''I like this kind of participatory art,'' said Mr. Gindi, a veteran of several Spencer Tunick nude photos and, in his clothed hours, a Broadway producer.
Though Mr. Throwell hoped that the public would connect the nude Wall Street workers with the economy, most did not make that leap. Faced with a woman stripping off her bra and panties as she talked into a headset about ordering a case of Champagne for her boss, or with a man, all his bits dangling, leading an invisible aerobics class on the sidewalk, passers-by simply whipped out their camera phones.
''It's a commercial,'' someone said. ''Some kind of stunt,'' another person ventured. ''The craziest thing I've seen down here,'' offered a third.
''Is it a statement?'' asked Aileen Carson, a health aide who stopped to take in the scene. ''What are they trying to say?'' Whatever it was, she liked it. ''They had the boldness to do it, which I admire,'' she said, surveying the bodies. ''It looked to me that they're free.''
Korey Smith, a newspaper vendor outside the Wall Street stop of the 2/3 subway, watched the proceedings as only a New Yorker might. ''There has been a lot of nakedness this summer,'' he observed. ''That's the theme this year. I'm not even shocked.''
One person who understood the work's aim, since she helped inspire it, was Mr. Throwell's mother, whose maternal support extended only so far.
''My son is very creative,'' Ms. Elliott said carefully when reached by phone. ''I'm a little bit more prudish.'' She did not make it to the Wall Street installation on Monday morning.
''She doesn't necessarily agree with it,'' her son said. ''But she said she appreciates the thought.''

HEADLINE: Reaping Millions From Medicaid In Nonprofit Care for Disabled

BYLINE: By RUSS BUETTNER

 BODY:
Medicaid money created quite a nice life for the Levy brothers from Flatbush, Brooklyn.
The brothers, Philip and Joel, earned close to $1 million a year each as the two top executives running a Medicaid-financed nonprofit organization serving the developmentally disabled.
They each had luxury cars paid for with public money. And when their children went to college, they could pass on the tuition bills to their nonprofit group.
Philip H. Levy went as far as charging the organization $50,400 for his daughter's living expenses one year when she attended graduate school at New York University. That money paid not for a dorm room, but rather it helped her buy a co-op apartment in Greenwich Village.
The rise of the Levy brothers, from scruffy bearded social workers in the 1970s to millionaires with homes in the Hamptons, Sutton Place and Palm Beach Gardens, reveals much about New York's system for caring for the developmentally disabled -- those with conditions like cerebral palsy, Down syndrome and autism. 
The state spends, by far, more than any other caring for this population: $10 billion this year, and roughly 20 cents of every dollar spent nationally.
More than half of that money goes to private providers like the Levys, with little oversight of their spending.
And the providers have become so big and powerful that they shape much about how the system operates, from what kinds of care are emphasized to how much they will be paid for it.
''They're bigger than government in some ways,'' said Thomas A. Maul, former commissioner of the state's Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities. ''That isn't what our system was supposed to be.''
The organization run by the Levys, the Young Adult Institute Network, has been among the most aggressive, and is now the largest operator of group homes for the state, collecting more than $1 billion from Medicaid over the past decade and running homes with a total of 700 beds, along with day programs, a school, dental care and transportation for the developmentally disabled.
The organization and the Levys have earned many admirers in the field for the quality and range of their programs. They are known for recruiting and keeping good employees, many of whom spend decades with the organization.
But their spending is seldom scrutinized, and, even when state officials turn up questionable expenses, there are few consequences.
The state, of course, has a financial interest in maintaining and expanding the programs, which bring more federal money and more jobs, especially to areas upstate, where many of the nonprofit organizations are major employers.
At the end of June, two days after The New York Times asked about the spending for his daughter's apartment, Philip Levy, 60, abruptly retired as chief executive. Joel M. Levy, 67, also departed in June, after serving as a $250,000-a-year part-time consultant following his departure from the chief executive's position in 2009.
A spokesman said the changes were unrelated to the inquiry by The Times.
Filling a Vacuum
Philip and Joel Levy were running Saturday night bingo games to support a tiny program for 15 developmentally disabled people in the early 1970s when their whole world changed.
In 1972, Geraldo Rivera, then a young reporter at WABC-TV, found his way inside the Willowbrook State School on Staten Island, a state-run institution that housed some 5,000 developmentally disabled residents in deplorable conditions. His footage showed naked children huddled on floors, feces smeared on walls, and an attendant oddly grinning through the darkness.
Public outrage exploded. A lawsuit brought by a parents group, the New York State Association for Retarded Children, resulted in a court order that forced the state to quickly move thousands of people into smaller community homes.
The state released a wave of public money and turned to nonprofit providers, which opened more than 100 group homes from 1976 through 1979. The Young Adult Institute, founded by a psychologist and his wife in 1957, emerged as a leader, opening and operating a dozen group homes.
The Levy brothers were determined to be a part of the revolution in care, and ascended at the Young Adult Institute, eventually taking over the top jobs in 1979: Joel as executive director and Philip as associate executive director. Their ambition to expand sometimes conflicted with the views of the network's board of directors, made up mostly of parents of children with developmental disabilities, who felt that the organization should remain small and focused on their children.
Over the years, the parents were replaced by professionals from other fields who supported growth.
''They were the most entrepreneurial folks that I ever met,'' said Barbara B. Blum, who was in charge of the deinstitutionalization effort for New York. ''When we were under court order to provide all kinds of services, the Levy brothers recognized the fact that there really was a vacuum, and they walked into it.''
Ms. Blum credited the brothers with persuading first-rate dentists, doctors and other medical professionals -- ''who wouldn't have touched some of the folks at Willowbrook,'' she said -- to treat developmentally disabled people.
The Young Adult Institute joined with other nonprofit providers to form a lobbying group, and, as the programs and spending multiplied, the relationship between the state and the providers gradually shifted.
The providers gained more sophistication, expertise and power.
The providers and officials from the Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities -- now called the Office for People With Developmental Disabilities -- met monthly to agree on new programs, expansion of existing programs and reimbursement rates. Then, together with the agency officials, they would lobby the Legislature and the governor's office for the money.
The providers became powerful advocates for the people in their care, and savvy strategists, alert to opportunities to increase financing.
In the early 1980s, Paul J. Castellani, a former official at the state agency, was overseeing the design of an algorithm that determined reimbursement rates for each developmentally disabled individual, based on his or her level of impairment. The formula was supposed to be closely held. But state officials suspected that a consultant to the providers had learned that vision problems greatly increased the rates paid.
Suddenly, the nonprofit providers began reporting a big increase in the number of individuals in their care who had trouble seeing. ''We called it the day everyone went blind,'' said Mr. Castellani, the author of a book about the New York system of caring for the developmentally disabled.
The Levys were especially resourceful. As state financing for creating new group homes slowed in the early 1990s, they expanded into other services for developmentally disabled people, including a preschool and kindergarten, medical clinics and a jobs program. In 1998, revenue at their organization topped $100 million for the first time.
That year, the state resumed its effort to establish group homes, offering a new wave of financing for nonprofit groups to develop them, even as other states shifted their focus to less expensive care, like helping people find and stay in apartments of their own. The Young Adult Institute was again among the biggest developers, adding some 250 beds in group homes over the next decade.
And its group homes tend to be among the most expensive run by nonprofit providers, at least according to the documents the organization submits to Medicaid.
Inflated Costs
On the 11th floor inside the Young Adult Institute's busy West 34th Street headquarters in Manhattan, a team of fund-raisers works year-round to plan the organization's biggest annual events: a gala dinner at the Pierre hotel off Fifth Avenue that attracts celebrities like Al Roker and Harry Smith, and a Central Park fun run and walk.
But at the end of each year, from 1999 to 2010, when it came time for the organization to seek its Medicaid reimbursements, those fund-raising employees suddenly became group home administrative workers on accounting records, allowing for federal reimbursement of their salaries, according to federal prosecutors.
Prosecutors also said the organization submitted documents falsely asserting that all of its group home regional directors were licensed social workers -- again inflating reimbursements for their salaries from Medicaid.
The prosecutors, from the United States attorney's office for the Southern District of New York, with assistance from the New York attorney general's office, brought a federal false claims lawsuit under seal in 2009 against the organization for the practices, which were brought to their attention by a whistle-blower, Richard Faden, the nonprofit group's longtime budget director. Mr. Faden, who was involved in the preparation of the documents, told prosecutors that for years expenses had been pumped up on annual financial reports to win higher reimbursements from Medicaid.
Last January, the organization agreed to pay $18 million in restitution and penalties to settle the suit, denying wrongdoing and saying it had made errors ''under the complex cost-reporting rules that apply to Y.A.I.'s residential services.'' A spokesman last week added that the organization had decided that the settlement would be less costly and disruptive than protracted litigation.
In June, the nonprofit group submitted a plan to the state, saying it would repay the money in part by keeping its executive salaries flat for a period of years. Last month, the state rejected that proposal, saying it expected executive pay to be reduced.
Records show that, over the years, the organization and other providers have had remarkable success in winning appeals for higher Medicaid reimbursements from the state, resulting in more than $100 million in additional spending on group home care in the state over the past decade.
The nonprofit groups have wide latitude in appeals. If they can show they lost money, they can apply for more financing for, say, a resident who requires extra attention for behavioral problems or develops a medical issue, or for expenses like utilities that exceed their budget.
The appeals system generally receives little scrutiny. But in 1995, the Commission on Quality of Care and Advocacy for Persons With Disabilities, a state watchdog agency, released a report that found deep flaws in the process, including that the Young Adult Institute and six other nonprofit groups had been granted rate appeals to cover ''excessive administrative costs.''
The report was not received warmly by the nonprofit providers and their allies in Albany. The following year, the commission's budget was slashed by the Legislature.
The Young Adult Institute won more than $1 million in Medicaid appeals over the past seven years for a single group home -- a residence on East 35th Street -- one of the most expensive homes of its kind in the state. For care of the 28 developmentally disabled people housed there, whose needs are among the most acute in the nonprofit system, the organization received $7.2 million in 2010, or $700 per person per night.
Over all, the organization's rates for group homes at the intermediate care level, which require higher levels of care and supervision, rose by 48 percent from 2004 to 2010. Rates for similar group homes run by nonprofit providers around the state increased by 37 percent during the same period, while inflation was 15 percent.
'Medicaid Moguls'
Mr. Castellani, the former Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities official, calls them ''Medicaid moguls'' -- the nonprofit executives who have prospered while providing services to 135,000 developmentally disabled people in New York.
At the top of the class are the executives at the Young Adult Institute. No organization in the field in New York has paid its executives as well. Four of its executives received compensation in excess of $500,000 in 2009; none of its competitors had more than one executive at that level, according to a review by The Times of tax returns of the 100 largest providers.
That year, the last for which tax filings are available, Joel Levy collected more than $1 million and Philip was close behind, with $916,647. The chief operating officers, Thomas Dern and Stephen Freeman, earned $551,682 and $578,938.
Similar-sized nonprofit groups in New York pay an average salary to chief executives of $493,000, according to the Economic Research Institute, an executive compensation consulting company that advises companies, nonprofit groups and the Internal Revenue Service.
The Young Adult Institute also pays for its top executives to lease vehicles for personal and professional use. Accounting obtained by the state showed leases for two Lexuses and a Volvo. A spokesman declined to provide details about the cars, except to say the executives are allowed to select their own vehicles within certain price ranges.
Marcella C. Fava, who led the organization's board for more than 20 years, said the compensation was based on the findings of companies that specialize in compensation analyses.
She said the companies surveyed salaries among nonprofit organizations within the field, but also made allowances for the Young Adult Institute's ''singular'' size and complexity.
''Our retention programs have worked,'' she said, speaking of the broader management. ''We've got a more experienced management team than, I think, any other agency.''
Linda M. Lampkin, research director of the Economic Research Institute, was puzzled by Ms. Fava's explanation, saying her organization's database of tax returns filed by every nonprofit organization in the country shows nothing close to the Levys' compensation.
''If you look at what others are being paid, I don't know where their comparisons are coming from, because I can't find anything,'' she said.
At the Young Adult Institute, there were other elements of compensation within those big numbers, like the tuition compensation: for eight years ending in 2004, the organization directly covered the costs of college for children of several senior-level executives, including Philip Levy and Mr. Freeman.
The existence of the tuition program was discovered in 2009 by the state's Commission for Quality Care during a limited review of the organization in response to a tip. The results were never publicly released but were obtained by The Times under the state's Freedom of Information Law.
After The Times discovered property records showing the purchase of the co-op apartment for Philip Levy's daughter, the organization confirmed that the money from the tuition program had been used to buy her the West 12th Street home.
The Young Adult Institute spokesman declined to say how much was spent on education expenses, but in its final year, the program provided $132,611 to cover tuition for four children of three executives, including Philip Levy.
Ms. Fava said it was viewed as an attractive benefit for top executives. Several were confronting big college tuition bills at about the same time.
''This seemed to be a really nice retention tool,'' Ms. Fava said. ''It had a quality to it, we're going to help you pay for your kids' college. So, sure, we could have increased their salary or given them a bonus. But this had a nicer, you know, cultural component to it.''
The report also noted that a Young Adult Institute affiliate, the New York League for Early Learning, had paid the Levy brothers consulting fees of about $50,000 a year from 2007 through 2009, on top of their salaries. And it questioned other expenses, including lunches and dinners for executives and the $1,468 that Philip Levy spent to stay for two nights at the Beverly Hills Hotel in 2008, which he said was for a meeting with a possible donor.
The commission, which has no enforcement powers, suggested that the organization's board ''consider carefully'' whether certain expenditures ''are compatible with the obligation of the board to act as a faithful steward of public funds.'' More than 95 percent of the organization's revenue comes from government sources, primarily Medicaid.
In June, two days after The Times e-mailed a Young Adult Institute spokesman seeking more detail about the tuition program, the Levy brothers ended their employment there. The organization announced the departures two weeks later in a press release, saying Philip Levy was retiring, but quoting him as saying he was looking forward ''to a new stage of my career.'' The spokesman, Jesse Derris, said that Joel Levy's departure as a consultant had been expected, and that Philip Levy had been unable to come to terms on a new contract with the group's board.
The Levys appear to be financially well prepared for the next phase of their lives. Each received deferred compensation totaling about $1.8 million in 2008 and 2009.
Courtney Burke, commissioner of the Office for People With Developmental Disabilities, last week took a step toward reining in high executive salaries at the nonprofit groups. She sent a one-page letter to them on Tuesday seeking their assistance to develop ''a consistent and rational model of compensation.''
''Given the heightened concerns about the growth of Medicaid and Medicare, this compensation guidance should be established sooner rather than later,'' she wrote.
A spokesman for Ms. Burke said that if the providers were unable to agree on an approach, her office had the authority to write compensation standards into state regulations and contracts with providers.
Whatever concerns exist about executive compensation, the Young Adult Institute clearly has fans among families of developmentally disabled people.
Margaret Puddington said her 30-year-old son, Mark, had been participating in its programs for several years before he moved into a Young Adult Institute group home four years ago. Ms. Puddington said the organization excelled at hiring caring people, investing in training and supervising programs.
''Mark loves his life,'' she said. ''I don't know what higher compliment there could be. He loves his staff. He loves his housemates. He loves his activities. They watch over him very, very carefully all the time.''
During an interview at his office in May, Philip Levy declined to discuss his compensation or that of his brother. He repeatedly said how much he loved his work and said the public money had been well spent on services.
There was no indication during the interview that he would depart weeks later. ''I think one of the things New York has to do is puff out its chest a bit and say, 'We are incredibly proud that we created the best system of care for people with developmental disabilities anywhere in this country,' '' he said.

HEADLINE: To Punish Iran, Seize Its Embassy

BYLINE: By AVI JORISCH. 
Avi Jorisch, a former Treasury Department official, is the author of ''Tainted Money: Are We Losing the War on Money Laundering and Terrorism Finance?''

 BODY:
Washington
LAST week, the Treasury Department accused the Iranian government of aiding Al Qaeda and blacklisted six Qaeda operatives for funneling money through Iran. Although Treasury's announcement, coupled with existing sanctions, has put some pressure on Tehran, much more can be done. Indeed, the White House should take action in its own backyard.
In February, the Obama administration embarked on a real estate project that directly impacts Iran's interests in the United States. The State Department began refurbishing Iran's Washington embassy on Massachusetts Avenue, 31 years after the last Iranian diplomat set foot in it. While the government has thus far respected and protected Iran's property rights and permitted Iranian officials an unparalleled level of freedom, Washington should now seize outright all Iranian assets in the United States and bar as many Iranian officials as possible from our soil. 
Tehran remains the legal owner of several buildings in Washington, although the United States government has taken them over. The State Department has become the legal guardian of the embassy and three residences, renting them out and using the proceeds to maintain them.
In November 1979, Iranians took over the American Embassy in Tehran, leading to a 444-day hostage crisis. For decades, the building has served as a school for the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, a group Washington labels a terrorist organization, and to this day, Iran does not recognize Washington as the property's legal owner.
Likewise, the contrast between the freedom of movement Iranian officials enjoy in the United States and the restrictions on American officials' travel to Iran is stark. Iran has a diplomatic mission at the United Nations and a fully staffed interests section housed in the Pakistani embassy in Washington; Iranian officials come to Washington to attend International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings; and Iranian officials receive visas to attend engagements of prominent international organizations in the United States. The Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, has come to New York several times during his presidency to attend United Nations meetings, from which he cannot be barred. And each time, American taxpayers have been left to foot the bill for his large security detail.
No American president has traveled to Tehran since 1977 and American government officials rarely travel there in an official capacity. If American officials were welcome in Tehran they would need significant security coverage and the Iranian government could not be counted on to provide or pay for it.
As the United States implements robust sanctions against Iran around the globe, we must also take action within our own borders. The government should seize all of Iran's properties in the United States and rent the space to liberal Iranian opposition groups. This would send a clear signal to Iran's government and its citizens that America supports reformers who seek a democratic future in Iran.
Under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the president can respond to an ''unusual and extraordinary threat'' to America's economy, foreign policy or national security. The act also allows him to confiscate the property of any entity he deems to be engaged in hostilities against the United States, and to use those assets to serve American interests. Iran clearly meets this test. Since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iran and its terrorist agents have had a policy of attacking American interests around the globe.
The United States has taken such actions before. In 2003, Washington confiscated valuable Iraqi government property and eventually put $1.7 billion toward the postwar reconstruction effort there. More recently, the Obama administration seized Libyan assets held at American banks and is seeking a way to send that money to Libyan rebels.
American policy makers must make it clear that the United States is serious about forcing Iran to change its behavior. Tehran has yet to develop a nuclear weapon, but sanctions have only delayed its efforts, not quashed its ambitions. Seizing Iran's assets and barring its officials from the United States would send a strong message that Washington aims to stop Iran's nuclear program by any peaceful means necessary.

HEADLINE: For Giffords, House Shows It Can Unite

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER and JEFF ZELENY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With two minutes to go and roughly 20 votes needed to pass a bill to raise the nation's debt limit, a smattering of applause rippled from a corner of the House chamber. After a few seconds of confusion, a flash of teal jacket could be seen almost floating among a sea of Democrats.
There she was, Representative Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona, appearing unexpectedly Monday evening to cast one of the last votes needed to send the measure over the top.
The full chamber erupted in loud applause as Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House whip, flicked his eyes from the vote board to Ms. Giffords. It was the first time she had been in the chamber since she was critically injured in an assassination attempt in January in Tucson. 
As Ms. Giffords walked tentatively to her seat, accepting embraces and kisses from Democrats and Republicans both, the long and bitterly partisan spectacle that has engulfed the nation seemed to melt quietly away. In its place was a vital blink of hope that ideological intransigence -- something Ms. Giffords had little patience for as a lawmaker -- had faded in a Capitol that seemed to be careering toward dysfunction.
''The Capitol looks beautiful tonight,'' Ms. Giffords posted in a message on Twitter, ''and I am honored to be at work tonight.''
The vote board, for minutes stuck near 200, suddenly clicked quickly to the 216 affirmative votes needed to pass the bill to avert an almost certain economic catastrophe.
Ms. Giffords has been following the debt debate from her home, said Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, a close friend, and had told her husband, Capt. Mark E. Kelly of the Navy, that she wanted to be at the Capitol if her yes vote would be needed.
It was not, Ms. Wasserman Schultz said, but in several conversations late into Sunday night, it became clear that Ms. Giffords wanted to come anyway. In the morning, she tagged along with her husband, an astronaut, who had already planned a trip to Washington.
''She decided that even if it's not pivotal, it's important to her constituents that she be there for the vote,'' Ms. Wasserman Schultz said. ''She would be a yes vote, she said, and she wanted to cast a vote.''
Ms. Giffords arrived in Washington shortly before the vote. Only a handful of Congressional leaders knew she was there.
On the House floor, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the minority leader, hailed Ms. Giffords's return. ''There isn't a name that stirs more love, more admiration, more respect,'' she said, adding, ''Thank you, Gabby.''
Ms. Giffords moved her mouth slowly, seeming to speak, and was less than steady on her feet. She wore glasses and had short brown hair -- a contrast from the longer blond hair she wore before being shot in the head -- but her smile was remarkably the same.
''She smiled to me and said, 'I love you,' '' said Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the Democratic whip. ''She's still got a ways to go, but she clearly is on top of things in terms of understanding.''
Her dramatic appearance came after a day in which Republicans initially seemed confident that things were finally turning around in the chamber, beset last week by a near failure to pass their own bill. But around 5 p.m., things started to seem suddenly grim for them. Members of the Armed Services Committee, uncomfortable with a component in the bill that could result in cuts to military spending, began to make it clear that they could not support the bill.
Representative Bobby Schilling, Republican of Illinois, made a quick call to his wife before heading to House chamber to listen to the last hour of debate on the bill, hoping someone on the floor would convince him how to vote.
Mr. Schilling, a member of the Armed Services Committee who struggled until the very last minute to decide which way to vote, was among the scores of headaches for the Republican leadership team, whose members were loath to do a hard sell yet again.
Mr. Schilling whipped out a little chart that showed a reduction in bombers and other weapons programs over recent years. He said the proposed cuts to the military if a new Congressional committee should fail to come up with a deficit reduction plan that passes muster with Congress ''really scares me,'' he said. ''We're on the fringe right now. We can barely defend ourselves.''
One of the last to vote, he ultimately supported the bill.
Staff members from the office of Mr. McCarthy and Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the Republican majority leader, leaned on the aides of on-the-fence members, fuming, at times, said several staff members, that their bosses would not simply commit and move on.
To get the bill to pass, Mr. McCarthy and Mr. Cantor worked the phones, as well as the hallways and the floor of the House.
''All of the sudden they were all sitting here and, whishhhhh, ran back to the back to whip people,'' Mr. Schilling said. ''I better hide! Oh my gosh!''
Rank-and-file members aided the effort. ''Our appropriators believe they will be able to defend our defense spending,'' said Representative Mike Pence of Indiana, who said he was working over his colleagues who were concerned about possible cuts to the military, like Mr. Schilling.
Most of the efforts to whip up votes clearly paid off.
''It always comes to the end,'' said Mr. McCarthy, who received his first whip report of the day around 2 p.m.
The initial shortfall seemed to be coming from Republicans, whose concerns were not only about signing onto a compromise with Democrats, Mr. McCarthy said, but also about being on record supporting the debt ceiling, a lightning-rod issue among conservatives.
For the next three hours, a roster of undecided members was divided among Mr. McCarthy, Mr. Cantor and Representative Peter Roskam of Illinois, the deputy whip, who sequestered themselves in Mr. Cantor's office just off the House floor. They knew they had room for error, but were not sure how much.
''We were trying to grow the vote,'' Mr. McCarthy said.
Even Speaker John A. Boehner cast a vote -- his fourth of the 112th Congress.
A large share of Democrats waited until the end of the 15-minute voting session, hoping to draw out as many Republicans as possible. The look of surprise was clear on the face of Mr. McCarthy, who flicked his hair, rubbed his eyes and his face as he circled the Republican side of the chamber.
When Ms. Giffords entered the chamber, Mr. McCarthy and others around him first heard a rumor that President Obama was on the House floor. It was several seconds before he and others realized that she was making an appearance.

HEADLINE: With Little Time, Deal Was Forged Over Tough Choices and Chinese Food

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES and JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Last Friday night, President Obama called Speaker John A. Boehner just after the Republican House leader had gotten his rebellious Republicans, on the third effort, to pass legislation to address the debt crisis.
''Congratulations on finally getting your bill through,'' Mr. Obama said, according to a Democrat familiar with the conversation. ''You know you're not going to get through the Senate, so now we need to focus on a solution.''
Roughly 48 hours later, at 8:15 on Sunday night, the president again called Mr. Boehner from the Oval Office.
''Do we have a deal?'' Mr. Obama asked, then stopped abruptly. His senior advisers, standing nearby, gathered that Mr. Boehner had interrupted the president, and they braced for confirmation of the worst in Mr. Obama's next words. Instead, there was relief. 
''Congratulations to you, too, John,'' Mr. Obama finally said.
In between those two calls was a weekend of nonstop horse-trading, from a windowless Capitol basement room to the Oval Office, over a deal to increase the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling and reduce future budget deficits. There were flashes of hope and heart-stopping moments when failure -- and a government default on its bills -- seemed inevitable.
Anticipated since Republicans won control of the House last November, the showdown was proving the ultimate test of divided government; success hinged largely on Mr. Boehner's uncompromising House Republicans' providing enough votes to approve the deal and make sure it got to Mr. Obama by Tuesday midnight, the administration's deadline for raising the debt ceiling, or very soon after.
Pivotal to the final deal-making was the Republican minority leader in the Senate, Senator Mitch McConnell, and his back-channel talks with his former Senate colleague, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
Last week Mr. Biden had reached out to Mr. McConnell, but only on Friday morning did he call back -- just long enough to say that they had nothing to discuss until the fate of Mr. Boehner's bill, which would have made a debt limit increase contingent on huge spending cuts and passage of a balanced-budget amendment, was settled. That night, soon after the Boehner bill cleared the House, the Democratic-led Senate rejected it; the next day, the House Republicans in turn rejected a plan that Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, was proposing.
That point, people on both sides recall, was the nadir after months of maneuvering and negotiations. The debt-limit deadline was four days away and the two sides were as far apart as ever, no compromise in sight. Mr. Boehner had moved farther right to win his members' support, and it seemed no one in either party could envision a compromise that could draw enough Republican votes to get through the House.
''Now I'm scared,'' an administration official, speaking only on condition of anonymity, confessed then.
But dread was suspended on Saturday afternoon. At about 1:30, Mr. McConnell called Mr. Biden again, ready to engage. And the vice president was ready with a list of administration ideas for compromise -- worked up while the White House was forced to the sidelines of the partisan Congressional debates. The question was whether Mr. McConnell could speak for Mr. Boehner.
That morning, in the Capitol basement, intentionally far from roaming reporters' eyes, Mr. Obama's chief Congressional lobbyist, Rob Nabors, had broached some of the administration proposals with Mr. Boehner's chief of staff, Barry Jackson, and his policy director, Brett Loper.
In all such talks, officials say, the White House made it clear: which options Mr. Boehner chose would determine how many votes he would get from Democrats to offset his Republican defections, pass a debt-limit deal and avoid blame for a default.
That reality increased the 11th-hour leverage of Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic minority leader in the House. She and Mr. Reid, feeling left out, had been seething as the White House dealt with Republican leaders.
At 3:30 p.m. on Saturday, Mr. Obama had them both to the White House to hear the compromise ideas that three aides -- Gene Sperling, the senior White House economic adviser; Jacob J. Lew, the budget director, and Bruce Reed, Mr. Biden's chief of staff -- had worked up. If both parties later this year did not agree on a 10-year deficit reduction plan -- or approve a balanced budget amendment, which was unlikely -- so-called triggers would automatically impose policies that each party would want to avoid. (Ultimately, both sides agreed that the threats would be deep cuts in military spending -- anathema to Republicans -- and deep Medicare cuts, opposed by Democrats.)
The proposals did not include the administration's previous demands for a trigger that threatened Republicans with the prospect of higher taxes on the wealthy. The White House had concluded Republicans would never accept that, and time was running out. But neither Mr. Reid nor Mrs. Pelosi was ready to concede, say people familiar with events, and remained wary of the Biden-McConnell talks.
When Mr. Reid returned to the Senate after 5 p.m., he went to the floor and angrily contradicted Mr. McConnell's and Mr. Boehner's earlier claims that a deal was near. Back in his office, Mr. Reid and top aides began canvassing other Democratic senators, but with no receptionists working on the weekend, they fumbled to operate the complicated Capitol phone system.
Mr. McConnell, meanwhile, spoke three more times that day with Mr. Biden. That night he strategized with his staff between a series of phone calls, including one with Mr. Boehner. The group ordered Chinese food, and laughed when one fortune cookie advised: ''You may be spending too much money.''
The next morning Mr. McConnell was on two Sunday television shows, expressing optimism. Back at the Capitol, he ordered lunch, zipped back and forth through a back Capitol hallway to Mr. Boehner's office and talked five more times with Mr. Biden, aides say. But at the White House, the optimism of Saturday gave way to worry when the Republicans, especially Mr. Boehner, objected to threatened cuts in military spending.
Mr. Obama spoke to Mr. Boehner that afternoon. For several hours, he and his advisers made calls and shuffled between his office, Mr. Biden's and the nearby suite of William M. Daley, the president's chief of staff, to share intelligence. Mr. Obama jokingly complained, an adviser recalled, about the coffee stains left in the carpet separating the offices by his sleep-deprived advisers.
The Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, commuted from his department, working both on the deal and on contingency plans to allay a financial panic if no agreement emerged. Officials considered what public statement he should make before markets opened on Monday. Mr. Geithner kept the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, updated; the Fed, too, would have to announce its own emergency actions to reassure global investors.
Finally came the call between Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner. Twenty minutes later, Mr. Obama announced the agreement before television cameras.
At the Capitol, Mr. Boehner headed for an elevator to leave. Waiting for the doors to open, he leaned his head against the wall and audibly sighed.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Hopefuls, Less One, Line Up Against Debt Deal

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Courting the party's faithful, the Republican candidates for president in 2012 have embraced Tea Party sentiment and lined up against their leaders in Congress by opposing the debt ceiling compromise reached with President Obama.
All but one of the candidates criticized the agreement reached Sunday by Congressional leaders and the White House as weak and inadequate. Their positions suggest how the field is intent on courting Tea Party supporters as voters begin to form opinions of them.
After initially remaining silent on the agreement, Mitt Romney, who has promoted his experience on the fiscal front, derided the deal as a prelude to higher taxes. 
''As president, my plan would have produced a budget that was cut, capped and balanced -- not one that opens the door to higher taxes and puts defense cuts on the table,'' Mr. Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts, declared in a statement on Monday. ''President Obama's leadership failure has pushed the economy to the brink at the 11th hour and 59th minute.''
Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota; Tim Pawlenty, a former governor of Minnesota; and Newt Gingrich, a former speaker of the House, also criticized the bill.
Those candidates are apparently eager to maintain a sharp contrast with Mr. Obama, especially on his handling of the economy, and are fearful that backing a deal with him would undermine that message. They also seem to be betting that compromise remains a dirty word among voters who are most likely to be fully engaged once primary voting begins.
''There remains, in the eyes of your typical Iowa caucusgoer, a healthy dose of skepticism'' about the budget deal, said Matt Strawn, the chairman of the Republican Party of Iowa.
The candidates' opposition ''does seem to express the sentiment of what I'm hearing from Iowa voters,'' Mr. Strawn said.
Speaker John A. Boehner brushed aside the candidates' criticism, saying: ''Listen, I've got a big job to do here. Those running for president have their own aspirations.''
Only Jon M. Huntsman Jr., a former governor of Utah, expressed support for the deal, calling it ''a positive step toward cutting our nation's crippling debt.'' Mr. Huntsman, who served two years as Mr. Obama's ambassador to China, is trying to appeal to a broader and more moderate Republican electorate and is not campaigning in Iowa, the first state to vote next year.
Political strategists said that for most of the 2012 hopefuls, there was little advantage to be seen as embracing Washington at a time when polls show wide mistrust of the nation's leadership, particularly its handling of the debt crisis, and concern among Republican voters about the growth of federal spending.
''Without question,'' Mr. Strawn said, ''I have heard more than ever from voters expressing concern about not only the debt, but the need for fundamental structural reform of how Washington spends money.''
Mr. Romney, like Mr. Huntsman, has tried to appeal to more moderate Republican voters, but his opposition to the debt deal puts him on the same side of the argument as Mrs. Bachmann, who has been a vocal critic of any plan that includes an increase in the debt ceiling. Mrs. Bachmann returned to Washington on Monday from campaign events in Iowa to vote against the plan.
Alex Conant, a spokesman for Mr. Pawlenty, said the candidate believed that ''this deal is nothing to celebrate.''
''Only in Washington would the political class think it's a victory when the government narrowly avoids default, agrees to go further into debt and does little to reform a spending system that cannot be sustained by our children and grandchildren,'' Mr. Conant said.

HEADLINE: HSBC to Trim 30,000 Jobs in Cost-Cutting Move

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

 BODY:
3:55 p.m. Updated
LONDON - HSBC, the big European bank, said Monday that it was cutting 30,000 jobs, as part of a wide-ranging cost-cutting program to improve profitability.
The large-scale cuts, which would represent about 10 percent of HSBC's work force, are part of the company's strategy to reduce expenses by $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion over the next two years. The layoffs include 5,000 positions the bank has already started to eliminate this year by closing some businesses.
''They are obviously tackling their pretty poor cost-to-income ratio with the job cuts,'' Jane Coffey, head of equities at Royal London Asset Management, said. 
HSBC is the latest bank to announce job cuts amid regulatory uncertainty and global economic weakness. Credit Suisse said last week that it planned to eliminate 2,000 positions, or 4 percent of its jobs. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are also reducing their head counts. (A person with direct knowledge of the HSBC decision put the layoffs at 10,000 on Sunday.)
The job cuts come as HSBC reported decent earnings in the second quarter. On Monday, the bank said that profit rose 36 percent to $9.2 billion in the first six months of this year, up from $6.7 billion in the same period last year. It set aside $5.3 billion for bad loans and other credit risks, 30 percent less than in the first half of last year.
Stuart T. Gulliver, who took over as HSBC's chief executive in January, said he was ''pleased with these results, which mark a first step in the right direction on what will be a long journey.''
Shares of the British bank rose 4.4 percent in London after the bank reported better-than-expected first-half profit.
Most of the job cuts are focused on the more mature markets, including Europe and the United States. The financial firm closed its retail banking operation in Russia and Poland, shut 66 bank branches in Mexico and sold insurance businesses in Britain, Bermuda and Mexico.
HSBC announced Sunday that it would sell 195 of its branches in upstate New York to the First Niagara Financial Group for about $1 billion. The bank is also in talks with potential buyers for its credit card business in the United States. Mr. Gulliver said. Capital One Financial, said analysts, could be among the suitors.
Despite the retreat in the developed countries, HSBC plans to continue hiring in Asia and Brazil. The bank's costs rose to 57.5 percent in relation to revenue in the first half, from 50.9 percent a year earlier, partly because a war for talent in Asia pushed up staff costs. Mr. Gulliver said he expected such expense to remain high despite some signs that China's economy had started to cool.
HSBC's earnings and share price fared better over the last year than its British competitors, including Barclays, because the bank generates a large amounts of profit from fast-growing regions, with more than half of earnings coming from Asia.
Gain in commercial and retail banking operations and its wealth management unit more than compensated for a drop at HSBC's investment banking unit. Pretax profit rose 3 percent to $11.5 billion in the first half from $11.1 billion in the period last year, while earnings at its investment banking unit fell to $4.8 billion from $5.4 billion.
Still, Mr. Gulliver is seeking to reduce costs in light of stricter financial regulation and a difficult economic environment in Britain, its home market, and the rest of Europe. Mr. Gulliver said he expected the economic outlook for Asia and other emerging markets to ''remain positive.''
''Growth in the U.S. and Europe is likely to remain sluggish as long as the impact of high debt levels and government budget cuts weigh on economic activity,'' he said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.
Online Correction: August 1, 2011, Monday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of the story imprecisely described the layoffs. HSBC plans to cut 30,000 jobs through 2013. The bank has previously started to eliminate 5,000 of those positions.

HEADLINE: Fraud Convictions of Five Ex-Insurance Executives Are Overturned

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
8:22 p.m. Updated
A federal appeals court has thrown out the criminal convictions of five former insurance executives, delivering a blow to the Justice Department in one of the prominent cases brought during last decade's corporate accounting scandals.
Ronald E. Ferguson, the former chief executive of General Re, which is owned by Warren E. Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway, was convicted by a jury of fraud and conspiracy in a closely watched trial in 2008. Convicted alongside Mr. Ferguson were the Gen Re employees Elizabeth A. Monrad, Robert D. Graham and Christopher P. Garand; and Christian M. Milton of American International Group. 
A panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan said in an opinion issued Monday that the trial judge had unfairly prejudiced the defendants by admitting certain evidence related to fluctuations in A.I.G.'s stock price.
It is unclear whether federal prosecutors will retry the five former executives. A spokesman for the United States attorney's office in Connecticut, which tried the case, did not return requests for comment.
The trial centered on a complex reinsurance transaction initiated more than a decade ago. In October 2000, Gen Re helped A.I.G. structure an accounting maneuver that the government said had artificially manipulated A.I.G.'s financial statements. The deal increased A.I.G.'s loss reserves - a crucial indicator of performance for insurance companies - by $500 million in 2000 and 2001.
The controversial transaction, combined with other accounting issues at A.I.G., led to the resignation of Maurice R. Greenberg, the insurance giant's longtime chief executive. Mr. Greenberg, who left the company in 2005, was not charged in the case. He still faces a separate civil action brought by the New York attorney general's office.
In Monday's ruling, Chief Judge Dennis G. Jacobs, writing for a unanimous three-judge panel, said that the trial judge erred in admitting evidence showing that news of the reinsurance deal caused a 12 percent decline in A.I.G.'s stock price.
Judge Jacobs wrote that a number of other problems at A.I.G., including accusations that it had manipulated its earnings, could have factored into the company's stock price drop.
By allowing prosecutors to link the decline in A.I.G. shares to the questionable transaction ''prejudicially cast the defendants as causing an economic downturn that has affected every family in America,'' Judge Jacobs wrote.
''The defendants' substantial rights were affected,'' he wrote.
The appeals court also said that the Federal District Court Judge Christopher F. Droney, of Connecticut, had erred in his jury instructions.
The five defendants were sentenced to prison terms of one year to four years but were all on bail pending appeal. Befitting a prominent corporate-fraud trial, the defendants were represented by some of the country's most highly regarded appellate lawyers, including Seth P. Waxman, the former solicitor general of the United States.
''We're very gratified by the decision and we look forward to a new trial,'' said Frederick P. Hafetz, a lawyer for Ms. Monrad.
The 77-page opinion surveyed the history of the prosecution and highlighted a core issue at the heart of the government's case: Was the transaction in question merely an aggressive accounting technique or something more sinister? In detailing a telephone call in October 2000 between Mr. Ferguson and Mr. Greenberg that discussed the potential transaction, the court noted that it may ''have been an unlawful agreement to deceive A.I.G. stockholders.''
Or, said the court, ''it may have been a high-level brainstorming session about using accounting rules aggressively - but lawfully - to achieve an accounting objective.''
In 2006, A.I.G. paid $1.64 billion to resolve government investigations into its accounting practices.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: What We Learned in the Debt Debate

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Leaders Agree on Outlines of Deal to End Debt Crisis'' (front page, Aug. 1):
Today I must prepare myself, once again, to defend President Obama and his concessions to the Republican Party, concessions that will surely hurt the poor and middle class. Aside from the agreed provisions, it is frightening to think what across-the-board cuts might be mandated in 2013 if a proposed Congressional committee's recommendations are not accepted. 
I try to hang on to that magical evening in Chicago in November 2008 when there was so much hope for the future, but it is getting more and more difficult to find hope today. It's true that the Republicans are set on bringing this president down, but perhaps he could at least go down fighting. Please, President Obama, make us believe again!
JENNIFER DORN New York, Aug. 1, 2011
To the Editor:
Re ''After Protracted Fight, Both Sides Emerge Bruised'' (news analysis, front page, Aug. 1):
Oh, you had better believe that this deficit deal will ''increase the challenge of motivating voters in 2012''! But are Americans ready for another kind of challenge, in which they agree to do their homework and research and put party affiliation aside when they choose candidates to support?
Let us not forget that these elected officials got to Washington because of the voting public. A democracy cannot function without an informed public that is able to separate propaganda from fact. It is time for all of us to get busy.
MEL MINTHORN GAIL MINTHORN Wilton, Conn., Aug. 1, 2011
To the Editor:
Re ''The President Surrenders,'' by Paul Krugman (column, Aug. 1):
The deal to increase the debt ceiling has conclusively shown that President Obama is easy prey to extortion exacted by the Republican leadership. It is truly time for the third-party movement recently advocated in columns by Thomas L. Friedman. A weak, failed presidency and a dysfunctional Congress bode ill for the future of democracy in the United States.
HERMAN SCHLOSS Prescott Valley, Ariz., Aug. 1, 2011
To the Editor:
Re ''To Escape Chaos, a Terrible Deal'' (editorial, Aug. 1):
No one seems to be pointing the finger at those most responsible for the debt-ceiling debacle we have witnessed in recent weeks -- the Democrats who chose to sit out the November 2010 election. Low Democratic turnout was an important reason for the extreme right-wing victories in Congressional races.
And now, we are all paying the price. I hope that the lessons learned will be reflected in November 2012.
ELLEN S. HIRSCH New York, Aug. 1, 2011
To the Editor:
While the debt-limit fiasco may rank as the all-time low in Congressional behavior, it has made one thing crystal clear: the Tea Party neither believes in nor trusts America's system of government. Its followers have been willing to obstruct the government's operations and undermine America's credit reputation. While purporting to support the Constitution, they have ignored or misrepresented the government's fiscal responsibilities.
It is time for the American people to hold the Tea Party responsible for the damage it has caused.

HEADLINE: Lawmakers in Both Parties Fear That New Budget Panel Will Erode Authority

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR and CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Lawmakers from both parties expressed scorn on Monday for a central feature of the deficit-reduction deal that creates a powerful 12-member committee of Congress to recommend major changes in entitlement programs and the tax code.
The lawmakers said the panel would usurp their authority to write and revise legislation. 
Under the deal, forged after weeks of tempestuous negotiations, proposals from the new panel, known as the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, would be considered under expedited procedures meant to guarantee an up-or-down vote in each house of Congress by Dec. 23. The proposals could not be amended.
Asked about the panel, Representative Michael C. Burgess, Republican of Texas, said: ''I hate it, I hate it, I hate it with a passion.''
Mr. Burgess, a physician, said he had fought to get to Congress and to join the Energy and Commerce Committee, which has broad authority over Medicaid, Medicare, telecommunications and the environment.
''We are giving away our authority,'' Mr. Burgess said. ''In this new 12-member committee, a seven-person vote can change the world.''
In the last seven decades, Washington has assembled more than a dozen blue-ribbon panels to grapple with fiscal problems. These include the Hoover Commission in 1947-49, the Grace Commission in 1982-84 and the Simpson-Bowles commission, created by President Obama last year.
The panels were often devised as a way to give political cover to policy makers to make unpopular changes. But in most cases, Congress ignored the proposals or deferred action.
''Most of these deficit commissions have ended up exactly the way Simpson-Bowles did: with lots of talk, lots of congratulations and no actual changes,'' said Bruce Bartlett, who was an economic adviser to President Ronald Reagan and the first President George Bush.
The Senate historian, Donald A. Ritchie, said, ''There are not many exact parallels'' to the new committee. Congress, Mr. Ritchie said, has had a number of joint committees, but most lacked the power to write and report legislation. One exception was the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, from 1946 to 1977.
The stated goal of the new joint committee -- composed of equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans from the House and the Senate -- is to reduce federal budget deficits by a total of at least $1.5 trillion over 10 years. If Congress does not promptly enact its recommendations, the government would automatically cut spending across the board in hundreds of military and nonmilitary programs, including Medicare.
Representative Robert E. Andrews, Democrat of New Jersey, supports the overall deal as a way to avoid a default on federal debt obligations. But Mr. Andrews said: ''I am very uneasy about the joint committee for a number of reasons. It takes people decades to learn the nuances of Medicare and Medicaid.''
It will, he said, be difficult for the 12-member panel to recommend changes in the intricate reimbursement formulas used to pay doctors, hospitals, nursing homes and other providers in these programs.
The procedures used to close military bases have been cited as a precedent for the deficit reduction committee. But the mandate of the new panel would be much broader.
''It could deal with the entire U.S. economy,'' Mr. Andrews said.
Representative Keith Ellison, Democrat of Minnesota, said: ''The joint committee usurps the legislative function. I don't think it's prudent or smart.''
Mr. Ellison said he worried that the committee would not adequately protect Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.
Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, said the joint committee was ''very seductive'' to Congressional leaders, who will appoint its members. ''The leaders get to control everything,'' Mr. Sessions said. ''The power to pick is the power to control.''
The Senate majority and minority leaders, the speaker of the House and the House minority leader will each appoint three members.
Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, said the committee would be ''a stacked deck'' because all the Republican appointees would oppose tax increases.
With Democrats insisting on new revenues and Republicans opposed, Mr. Menendez said, ''I do not see how the committee will be successful in making a presentation to Congress.''
Representative David Dreier, Republican of California and chairman of the Rules Committee, said: ''We've had countless commissions over the years that have proposed ideas for cutting deficits. Some ideas have had more merit than others, but their merit has been immaterial because no serious proposal has been afforded Congressional consideration.''
This time will be different, Mr. Dreier said, because the legislation ''ensures that Congress will address the proposals we receive.''
The new committee will include influential lawmakers. If Congress does not accept their advice, the automatic cuts will take effect, and those could be even more distasteful to lawmakers.
On the other hand, one Congress cannot bind another. In the future, Congress could override decisions made this year.
Republicans won control of the House last year by promising a return to regular order and denounced Democrats for cutting procedural corners.
Speaker John A. Boehner said the House must be allowed to ''work its will'' using ''the institutions that have grown up over 200 years of trial and error.''
''We don't need five members sitting behind a closed door writing a bill, like they did with the stimulus or 'Obamacare,' '' Mr. Boehner said in an e-mail exchange with National Journal in March. ''It's nuts.''
Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin and chairman of the Budget Committee, made a similar pledge. ''We're going to have an open and transparent process and allow any member of Congress to amend bills in committees and things like that,'' Mr. Ryan told a newspaper in his district, The Kenosha News, last fall.
Mr. Ryan and other Republicans have denounced an independent agency created by the new health care law to rein in the growth of Medicare. The powers of that panel, the Independent Payment Advisory Board, pale by comparison with those of the new joint committee.

HEADLINE: Spotlight Shifts Back To the Fed

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM and CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Even as Congress escapes from its brush with default, political divisions have all but immobilized the levers of fiscal policy, raising pressure on the Federal Reserve to address the nation's economic lethargy.
Failing to raise the debt ceiling could lead to an economic catastrophe. But even if the Senate on Tuesday joins the House in agreeing to let the government borrow more money, there is mounting evidence that the political turmoil has made a bad economic situation worse.
Manufacturing activity declined in July, a trade group reported Monday. Unemployment is climbing. So is inflation. And the high pitch of partisan rancor in Congress makes it difficult for either party to advance their incompatible economic agendas. 
The deal to raise the debt ceiling would reduce federal spending this year by billions of dollars, exacerbating a broader downturn in federal aid as the stimulus peters out. A payroll tax cut and extended benefits for the unemployed are scheduled to expire at the end of the year.
Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said in the spring that it was time to see whether the economy could stand on its own. Last month he said the Fed would consider new steps if conditions deteriorated significantly. As the Fed's policy-making committee prepares to meet Aug. 9, the drums are beating louder.
''I don't think they can do anything until we see how much was lost and how much we can recoup,'' said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial. ''But if we have persistent weakness, and stagnant employment growth through the third quarter, I just don't see how they can't step back into the game.''
The Fed already is engaged in a vast and unprecedented effort to bolster economic growth. It has held short-term interest rates near zero for almost three years, and amassed more than $2 trillion in Treasuries and mortgage bonds to hold down long-term rates. But since the end of June, when it completed its most recent round of asset purchases, the Fed has chosen to stand pat.
Its available options now are modest steps including replacing its promise to maintain low rates ''for an extended period'' with a more specific commitment, like a six-month minimum. More aggressive steps could include tilting the composition of its investment portfolio toward longer-term Treasury securities, to increase the downward pressure on long-term rates. The most drastic step, which analysts also consider least likely, would be a decision to increase the size of its portfolio.
For the moment, and for as long as possible, the central bank would like to do nothing. There is broad agreement that the unprecedented size of the Fed's portfolio has complicated its ability to control the pace of inflation, and that additional purchases would exacerbate the difficulty.
Mr. Bernanke has said that growth must weaken and price increases abate. A vocal minority of Fed officials has gone further, arguing the central bank has reached the limit of its powers.
''It seems unlikely that the forces limiting the pace at which U.S. growth is recovering are amenable to monetary policy,'' Jeffrey M. Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, said in a speech last week. ''Additional monetary stimulus at this juncture seems likely to raise inflation to undesirably high levels and do little to spur real growth.''
The Fed is even less eager to renew its interventions into financial markets. The central bank has hovered on the edge of the debt ceiling debate like a homeowner riding out a hurricane, hoping for limited damage to the lethargic economy.
''I want to eliminate any expectation that the Fed through any mechanism could offset the impact of a default on the government debt,'' Mr. Bernanke told Congress in July.
Even if the Congress meets President Obama's Tuesday deadline for a debt ceiling deal, the ratings agency Standard & Poor's has warned that it may downgrade long-term Treasury bonds, altering a basic premise of many financial transactions and unleashing smaller but still significant disruptions.
''If a huge amount of harm is being done to the markets and the economy, they will have to consider carefully whether there's anything they can do to help,'' said Donald L. Kohn, who stepped down last June after serving four years as vice-chair of the Fed's board of governors. ''The point of that would be to help the markets get through a chaotic period.''
During a previous debt ceiling standoff, which ran from the fall of 1995 through the spring of 1996, the Fed considered offering loans to banks that did not receive expected payments from the government, and honoring defaulted Treasuries as collateral, according to Alan Blinder, who served as vice chairman of the board of governors at the time.
''We had extensive discussions with the principal clearing banks in New York which then were Chase and Bank of New York,'' said Mr. Blinder, now a Princeton economics professor. ''What we on the board were most worried about was preserving the remnants of the Treasury market because of its central role in providing liquidity to the whole system.''
The Fed also could buy dollars in the event of a downgrade. Uncertainty already is driving investors to other currencies, and a sharper decline could undermine the dollar's role as an international reserve currency -- a status that has significant benefits for the American economy.
Such a step would be taken at the behest of Treasury, because the administration sets currency policy.
But there are strong reasons to doubt the government would try such an intervention. A weaker dollar could bolster growth by making American exports more attractive. In particular, it could improve the balance of trade with China -- while intervening to prop up the dollar would undermine the credibility of American efforts to convince China to stop manipulating its currency.
Perhaps most important, intervening in exchange markets may not prevent the dollar's fall. ''If the dollar were just weak because people had lost confidence in the U.S. government, I don't see why buying dollars is going to restore confidence,'' said Mr. Kohn, now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. ''The cure for that isn't intervention. The cure is the government acting like adults.''

HEADLINE: House Passes Deal To Raise Debt Cap And Defuse Crisis

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE; Jeff Zeleny and Jennifer Steinhauer contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- After months of partisan impasse, the House on Monday approved a budget agreement intended to head off a potential government default, pushing Congress a big step closer to the conclusion of a bitter fight that has left both parties bruised and exhausted.
Despite the tension and uncertainty that has surrounded efforts to raise the debt ceiling, the vote of 269 to 161 was relatively strong in support of the plan, which would cut more than $2.1 trillion in government spending over 10 years while extending the borrowing authority of the Treasury Department. It would also create a powerful new joint Congressional committee to recommend broad changes in spending -- and possibly in tax policy -- to reduce the deficit.
Scores of Democrats initially held back from voting, to force Republicans to register their positions first. Then, as the time for voting wound down, Representative Gabrielle Giffords, Democrat of Arizona, returned to the floor for the first time since being shot in January and voted for the bill to jubilant applause and embraces from her colleagues. It provided an unexpected, unifying ending to a fierce standoff in the House. 
The Senate, where approval is considered likely, is scheduled to vote at noon on Tuesday and then send the measure to Mr. Obama less than 12 hours before the time when the Treasury Department has said it could become unable to meet all of its financial obligations.
The deal sets in motion a substantial shift in fiscal policy at a moment when the economic recovery appears especially fragile. Although the actual spending cuts in the next year or two would be relatively modest in the context of a $3.7 trillion federal budget, they would represent the beginning of a new era of restraint at a time when unemployment remains above 9 percent, growth is slowing and there are few good policy options for giving the economy a stimulative kick.
The precise impact on the economy is a matter of debate. Proponents of spending restraint say that the economy will benefit in the long run from getting the deficit and the accumulated national debt under control, and that failure to act now would risk long-term decline in the nation's economic might. Others say that by foreclosing the option of using government spending to counteract economic weakness, the country is increasing the risk of persistently high unemployment and even another recession.
The negotiations exposed deep fissures within both parties. In the end, 174 Republicans and 95 Democrats backed the deal, and 66 Republicans and 95 Democrats voted against it. But Republicans and Democrats alike made clear they were not happy swallowing the agreement, which was struck late Sunday between the bipartisan leadership of Congress and President Obama.
Top lawmakers characterized the bill as a must-pass measure needed to prevent a potentially crippling blow to the struggling economy.
''The default of the United States is not an option,'' said Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 Democrat.
Mr. Hoyer urged lawmakers to vote not as members of either party, but as ''Americans concerned about the fiscal posture of their country, about the confidence that people around the world have in the American dollar.''
Republicans, while expressing dissatisfaction that the measure did not provide more savings, said it was a modest but useful first step in reversing the government's spending course and claimed they had prevailed by keeping the agreement free of new revenue and offsetting the increase in the debt limit with spending cuts.
''I would like to say this bill solves our problems,'' said Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, a prominent fiscal hawk in the Republican leadership. ''It doesn't. It is a solid first step.''
Worried about defections by conservatives and liberals alike, leaders of both parties gathered their members for briefings to explain the proposal. Speaker John A. Boehner met specially with Republicans on the House Armed Services Committee, an important voting bloc whose members were raising alarms about potential spending cuts for the Pentagon.
Democrats, many disgruntled over what they saw as a White House-negotiated giveaway to Republicans, heard from Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who told House and Senate members in separate meetings that the administration had to cut the deal with uncompromising Republicans to avoid a default.
Mr. Biden spent hours behind closed doors in the Capitol. According to participants in the meetings, he mixed listening and gentle persuasion, urging Democrats to back the plan.
Administration officials fanned out to make a case that the deal's structure -- with a trigger that could force deep cuts in military spending as well as in domestic programs if the two parties cannot agree on how to reduce the deficit further -- provided Democrats with more leverage to push for higher tax revenue as part of the solution rather than relying totally on spending cuts.
But many Democrats said they saw it as a deal negotiated on the backs of poor and working-class Americans, with no sacrifice by the rich in the form of tax increases.
''I wouldn't call it anger, but we are perplexed that it has turned out like it has,'' said Representative G. K. Butterfield, Democrat of North Carolina, grimacing as he left the Biden meeting. ''But we've run out of options and we know the consequences. I've heard horror stories from the Great Depression. I don't want my fingerprints on that.''
In the Senate, some Democrats attacked the plan and joined their House colleagues in complaining that the White House had bent to the will of an ideologically rigid majority in the House.
''This is capitulation to a radical fringe of the Republican Party that will not bend until they break this economy or get their own way,'' said Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey. ''This deal is not fair, and I will not support it.''
Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, acknowledged the unrest as the Senate prepared to follow the House in voting.
''Neither side got what they wanted, but it is the essence of compromise,'' said Mr. Reid, who said most senators ''realize the situation we're in and the alternative.''
House and Senate Republicans, too, raised objections, saying the proposal fell short of what was needed and invested too much power in a new special joint committee that would be charged with finding $1.5 trillion or more in future cuts by Thanksgiving after a first round of $1 trillion called for in the legislation.
''This agreement falls short of addressing our historic economic challenges and does not alleviate the threat of a crippling downgrade in America's credit rating,'' said Representative Steve Southerland, a freshman Republican from Florida.
But Mr. Boehner, who negotiated the deal with the White House along with Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, received two standing ovations in the private party meeting, and the House Republicans rallied around him in the final vote that he said represented a culture change in the nation's capital.
''We are cutting spending,'' Mr. Boehner told reporters. ''We are spending less money next year in discretionary spending than we spent last year. You haven't heard that kind of a statement before around this town.''
Several senators said they were struggling with what they would do, but suggested that if it became a matter of their yes vote or default, they would back the measure.
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut, said that because Republicans would not budge on new revenue and Democrats sought to protect entitlement programs, federal agencies would bear the brunt of the Congressional drive for deficit reduction.
''They are getting whacked,'' Mr. Lieberman said.
He said he remained worried about the impact on the military if the new committee failed to produce deficit-reduction legislation later this year, triggering an across-the-board slice of more than $1 trillion. Half of those savings would come from security-related spending.
Despite such misgivings, members of both parties welcomed the end of the debt-limit clash after months of intrigue, partisan rancor and stop-and-go negotiations that ultimately left Congress voting just hours before a deadline to avoid default.
''On to the next fight,'' said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas.
Lawmakers and aides were already speculating about who might be picked or passed over for the 12-member Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction and were arguing over whether the panel truly had the ability to seek new tax revenue.
But given the energy that had been expended in the fight, most members of Congress simply seemed ready to head home for the summer. The House dispatched lawmakers until Sept. 7. Senators were eager to follow.
''I have a home in Nevada that I haven't seen in months,'' Mr. Reid said wistfully on the floor. ''My pomegranate trees are, I'm told, blossoming.''

HEADLINE: The Tea Party's War On America

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
You know what they say: Never negotiate with terrorists. It only encourages them.
These last few months, much of the country has watched in horror as the Tea Party Republicans have waged jihad on the American people. Their intransigent demands for deep spending cuts, coupled with their almost gleeful willingness to destroy one of America's most invaluable assets, its full faith and credit, were incredibly irresponsible. But they didn't care. Their goal, they believed, was worth blowing up the country for, if that's what it took.
Like ideologues everywhere, they scorned compromise. When John Boehner, the House speaker, tried to cut a deal with President Obama that included some modest revenue increases, they humiliated him. After this latest agreement was finally struck on Sunday night -- amounting to a near-complete capitulation by Obama -- Tea Party members went on Fox News to complain that it only called for $2.4 trillion in cuts, instead of $4 trillion. It was head-spinning. 
All day Monday, the blogosphere and the talk shows mused about which party would come out ahead politically. Honestly, who cares? What ought to matter is not how these spending cuts will affect our politicians, but how they'll affect the country. And I'm not even talking about the terrible toll $2.4 trillion in cuts will take on the poor and the middle class. I am talking about their effect on America's still-ailing economy.
America's real crisis is not a debt crisis. It's an unemployment crisis. Yet this agreement not only doesn't address unemployment, it's guaranteed to make it worse. (Incredibly, the Democrats even abandoned their demand for extended unemployment benefits as part of the deal.) As Mohamed El-Erian, the chief executive of the bond investment firm Pimco, told me, fiscal policy includes both a numerator and a denominator. ''The numerator is debt,'' he said. ''But the denominator is growth.'' He added, ''What we have done is accelerate forward, in a self-inflicted manner, the numerator. And, in the process, we have undermined the denominator.'' Economic growth could have gone a long way toward shrinking the deficit, while helping put people to work. The spending cuts will shrink growth and raise the likelihood of pushing the country back into recession.
Inflicting more pain on their countrymen doesn't much bother the Tea Party Republicans, as they've repeatedly proved. What is astonishing is that both the president and House speaker are claiming that the deal will help the economy. Do they really expect us to buy that? We've all heard what happened in 1937 when Franklin Roosevelt, believing the Depression was over, tried to rein in federal spending. Cutting spending spiraled the country right back into the Great Depression, where it stayed until the arrival of the stimulus package known as World War II. That's the path we're now on. Our enemies could not have designed a better plan to weaken the American economy than this debt-ceiling deal.
One thing Roosevelt did right during the Depression was legislate into being a social safety net to soften the blows that a free-market economy can mete out in tough times. During this recession, it's as if the government is going out of its way to make sure the blows are even more severe than they have to be. The debt-ceiling debate reflects a harsher, less empathetic America. It's sad to see.
My own view is that Obama should have played the 14th Amendment card, using its language about ''the validity of the public debt'' to unilaterally raise the debt ceiling. Yes, he would have infuriated the Republicans, but so what? They already view him as the Antichrist. Legal scholars believe that Congress would not have been able to sue to overturn his decision. Inexplicably, he chose instead a course of action that maximized the leverage of the Republican extremists.
Assuming the Senate passes the bill on Tuesday, the debt ceiling will be a nonissue until after the next election. But the debilitating deficit battles are by no means over. Thanks to this deal, a newly formed supercommittee of Congress is supposed to target another $1.2 trillion to $1.5 trillion in cuts by late November. If those cuts don't become law by Dec. 23, automatic across-the-board cuts will be imposed, including deep reductions in defense spending.
As has been explained ad nauseam, the threat of defense cuts is supposed to give the Republicans an incentive to play fair with the Democrats in the negotiations. But with our soldiers still fighting in Afghanistan, which side is going to blink if the proposed cuts threaten to damage national security? Just as they did with the much-loathed bank bailout, which most Republicans spurned even though financial calamity loomed, the Democrats will do the responsible thing. Apparently, that's their problem.
For now, the Tea Party Republicans can put aside their suicide vests. But rest assured: They'll have them on again soon enough. After all, they've gotten so much encouragement.

HEADLINE: What Real Estate Sweeteners Have You Encountered?

BYLINE: DIANE CARDWELL


HIGHLIGHT: A seller is offering a 2002 Hyundai with 79,000 miles as an enticement to buy his one-bedroom co-op in Brooklyn; surely other unusual inducements are being offered.

 BODY:
This week the Appraisal visits Gary Parker, an administrator at New York University who is offering a free car as an enticement to purchase his one-bedroom co-op in Kensington, Brooklyn. The car is not quite fresh from the dealer's showroom, though: it's a 2002 Hyundai Elantra with 79,000 miles on it. 
Which leads us to this question: Amid all the promises of covered closing costs, a month's free rent or even a brand new Audi if you spend $2 million on an apartment, what are the most interesting, unusual or oddly unimpressive real estate sweeteners you've run across? Please share, and thanks.

HEADLINE: Barclays Reports Profit Plunge and Job Cuts

BYLINE: JULIA WERDIGIER


HIGHLIGHT: Barclays said profit fell 38 percent in the first half of the year because of costs for compensating customers for mistakes in selling some insurance and as earnings at its investment bank declined.

 BODY:
Barclays, one of the largest banks in Britain, said on Tuesday that its profit had dropped 38 percent in the first half of the year, weak results that underscored the financial firm's plan to cut costs and jobs .
 Net income at fell to 1.5 billion ($2.4 billion) in the first six months of 2011 from 2.4 billion in the period a year earlier. Barclays said it was hurt by high costs related to compensating customers who received incorrect advice on payment insurance and by a decline in investment bank earnings. Still, the earnings exceeded analysts' estimates, and its shares rose 2.9 percent in Tuesday trading in London. 
"The numbers are not perfect but it could be a lot worse, with concerns around the European sovereign debt situation, banking regulation reviews and the general economic environment," said Richard Hunter, head of British equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers in London.
The Barclays chief executive, Robert E. Diamond Jr., had pledged in February to review all businesses to find ways to reduce costs and improve profitability. Since then, the bank has decided to put its Russian retail operation up for sale and has been seeking to improve its loan books in Spain and Portugal.
"It's been a very difficult operating environment," Mr. Diamond said in a statement on Tuesday, adding that he expected "the second half to provide the same challenges." He said he was "pleased with the progress made across Barclays."
Like many other banks, Barclays is also in the process of eliminating jobs, about 3,000 this year. Barclays cut 1,400 positions in the first half, and Mr. Diamond said he "would expect the trend of the first half to continue and likely increase somewhat." 
His comments came after another large British bank, HSBC, announced on Monday that it planned to eliminate 30,000 jobs by the end of 2013. Credit Suisse said last week that it would eliminate 2,000 jobs. 
Banks are looking to adjust to slower trading volume as some clients are nervous about government debt levels in Europe and the United States. At the same time, new financial regulations and higher capital requirements have also weighed on profitability. 
Barclays said it had set aside 1.8 billion for bad loans and other credit risks in the first half, a decline of 41 percent from the period a year earlier. Return on equity, a measure of profitability, improved to 9.1 percent from 6.9 percent. Barclays has set itself a goal to reach a return on equity of 13 percent by 2013.
Barclays Capital reported pretax profit in the first half of 2.4 billion, a 9.3 percent drop from the period a year earlier, after demand for its credit, currency and commodities services and products declined. A drop in trading, especially in the second quarter, led income from bonds, currencies and commodities to fall 20 percent.
Mr. Diamond called on the British government and regulators to quickly end uncertainties about financial regulation. He reiterated that he was opposed to some proposals intended to shield retail businesses from investment banking operations, saying they could hurt the availability of credit.
Pretax profit at Barclays' retail banking operation fell to 446 million in the first half from 1.2 billion in the period in 2010 after its operations on the Continent, especially in Spain, widened its pretax loss amid a deteriorating economic environment. It also set aside 1 billion to compensate customers who mistakenly bought payment insurance.
Barclays said it expected its retail business in Western Europe to become profitable in the second half of the year. "It's early days and there's lots of work to do," Mr. Diamond said.

HEADLINE: Tom Colicchio's Secret Farm, Right Next to the F.D.R. Drive

BYLINE: GLENN COLLINS


HIGHLIGHT: A two-week-old farm has found a temporary home in a stalled Manhattan construction site less than 100 feet from the kitchen of Tom Colicchio's Riverpark.

 BODY:
When it comes to produce, there is local, there is hyperlocal, and then there is the Riverpark Farm at Alexandria Center.
This rather formal designation is the name of a two-week-old farm that has found a temporary home in a stalled Manhattan construction site bounded by plywood. It is less than 100 feet from the kitchen of Tom Colicchio's Riverpark restaurant on East 29th Street near the East River, and it is supplying produce for that 245-seat restaurant, as well as a 175-seat 'Wichcraft next door.
" 'Farm to table' now means something very different - we are literally bringing the farm to the table," said Mr. Colicchio, who added, "I'm actually shocked at how much is growing."
That's because the farm has an area of 15,000 square feet, as large as the vast new hydroponic rooftop garden in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, Gotham Greens.
Riverpark Farm is weeded, watered, tended, harvested and replanted by two full-time farmers, with the assistance of chefs from the kitchen, who can be observed sauntering through the garden, clipping herbs at dinnertime. "This week we're taking out 50 pounds of cucumbers a day," said Sisha Ortuzar, Riverpark's executive chef and a partner, "and last week it was zucchini and squash." The menu is changed daily to reflect the harvest. 
The garden is situated in the vacant footprint of the West tower of the Alexandria real estate project, one of hundreds of construction sites stalled by the recession whose permitting status has been legally "frozen" by the city, enabling them to resume construction without obtaining fresh permits when the economy turns around.
Since the farm will ultimately have to be moved, the vegetables are planted in milk crates filled with soil. The planters, 3,400 of them, were seeded and germinated at a farm in New Paltz, N.Y., then trucked down to the city and installed at 5 a.m. several weeks ago.
Currently there are 6,000 plants in 85 crops, including 10 kinds of tomatoes (beefsteak, plum, cherry and seven heirloom varieties); 12 kinds of peppers, from sweet to spicy; five varieties of eggplant; and 30 herbs. "We're also planting crops that are hard to find at the Greenmarket, like bronze fennel, red amaranth and ruby-streak mustard greens," Mr. Ortuzar said.
Jeffrey Zurofsky, Riverpark's managing partner, said, "We wanted to put in a beehive, but the bees have already found us - the garden is covered in local bees."
Mr. Ortuzar added, "The only ones enjoying this more than the bees is the kitchen staff - because we can work with it all."
But in September, the bees must learn to share. Part of the black-and-white plywood will be removed to permit Riverpark customers to dine in the garden at a 12-seat farmer's table. "They'll be able to dine among their produce," he said, "right in the garden."

HEADLINE: Spider-Man Spins a New Secret Identity

BYLINE: DAVE ITZKOFF


HIGHLIGHT: The Marvel Comics hero, at least as he exists in the Ultimate universe, has a new alter ego: Miles Morales, a teenager who is of black and Hispanic descent, and a rare person of color playing a major role in a mainstream publisher's comics.

 BODY:
In addition to possessing the proportionate strength, speed and self-doubt of a spider, the newest incarnation of Spider-Man has the uncommon power to bring some diversity to the superhero pantheon of Marvel Comics.
On Tuesday Marvel announced that issue No. 4 of its Ultimate Comics Fallout series, to be released on Wednesday, would establish a new alter ego for Spider-Man: Miles Morales, a teenager who is of black and Hispanic descent, and a rare person of color playing a major role in a mainstream publisher's comics.
"There's a lot going on in the world that just isn't touched upon in mainstream superhero fiction," Brian Michael Bendis, the author of Ultimate Comics Fallout, said Tuesday in a telephone interview. "I thought this was a grand opportunity for us to open the doors a little bit." 
Mr. Bendis, whose writing portfolio at Marvel also includes Daredevil, The Avengers and Ultimate Spider-Man, got to fulfill the desires of many a costumed villain when he killed off Peter Parker, Spidey's previous secret identity, in the pages of Ultimate Spider-Man No. 160. (This isn't the original, angst-ridden incarnation of Spider-Man that made his debut in 1962, but a version who lives in the Ultimate universe, a publishing line that Marvel created in 2000 for readers who had not kept up with its 50-plus years of superhero continuity.) 
Mr. Bendis said he and his colleagues had discussed killing off Peter Parker for many months before doing the deed. "All we talked about was, if there's someone else playing Spider-Man that isn't Peter Parker, what do they bring to the table?" Mr. Bendis said. "What's new that we're going to learn, what's that we're going to see?"
Then, as Mr. Bendis became more intrigued with the idea of creating a new identity for the character who would be from a minority background, he noticed an Internet campaign that was being waged by Donald Glover, the comedian and co-star of the NBC series "Community," who was semi-seriously hoping to be considered for the lead role in the new "Spider-Man" movie.
"I'm a huge 'Community' fan," Mr. Bendis said, "and I went: 'Why couldn't he be Peter Parker? He'd be a great Peter Parker.' Then I realized I was working on that project already. And I realized we were doing the right thing."
Mr. Bendis said he had also taken a lesson from a black friend who told him that Spider-Man was the only superhero that other children would let him play when he was growing up. "You couldn't see his skin color," Mr. Bendis said the friend told him. "He was any of us, when he was in costume."
Though both Marvel and DC Comics, its chief rival, have featured black and minority superheroes over the years, Mr. Bendis said that changing the identity of Spider-Man, a central character in the Marvel mythology if not its single most recognizable property, was a watershed moment.
"Spider-Man is a jewel in the Marvel crown," he said. "It's just a different story." 
Marvel said that the chronicles of Miles Morales and his new life as Spider-Man would continue in a new series, Ultimate Comics Spider-Man, to be written by Mr. Bendis and released in September.
And while there is no such thing as permanent in comic books, Mr. Bendis said: "This is for the long term. My track record says that once I put my mind to it, I'll hang in there."

HEADLINE: The Liberals' Dilemma

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: How the popularity of entitlements became a policy trap for the left.

 BODY:
If the deficit deal should inspire hawkish conservatives to consider the possibility that refusing tax increases effectively guarantees defense cuts, it should also inspire liberals to realize that by turning entitlement cuts into their own version of tax increases - the red line that they absolutely refuse to cross - they're ultimately putting their own priorities at risk. Here's Mark Schmitt, from a fine piece on this theme:... treating the entitlements as sacred comes at a huge cost in all the other programs. While there's surely waste in domestic discretionary programs, from agriculture subsidies to the occasional National Science Foundation grant that sounds silly, it also includes education, energy research, transportation-and basically everything that constitutes the investment in economic growth that we need far more than we need budget austerity. And while it might make some sense to insist on holding Social Security untouchable (its long-term funding shortfall is self-contained, and won't affect the larger budget picture unless it is still unresolved in two decades), it's very strange to take the same approach to Medicare, which is projected to consume 5.5 percent of GDP by 2035, up from 3.6 percent today, without providing better services or serving significantly more people. Protecting the current Medicare cost curve cannot be considered a fundamental progressive principle ...
Finally, the ultimate victim of a budget deal that holds entitlements sacred is going to be entitlements themselves. For years, advocates of budget austerity such as the billionaire Peter G. Peterson and his eponymous foundation have sought to construct an alliance of the beneficiaries of discretionary programs-advocates for children, education, health research, etc.-to argue that their priorities are threatened by an "entitlement crisis." It wasn't true. But if Medicare spending were protected and allowed to almost double over ten years, while domestic programs were squeezed by the Reid caps, it would certainly become true. The political alliance to cut those programs would become broader and more powerful, and the eventual cuts could be clumsy or destructive. It's the nature of entitlement programs, especially Social Security and Medicare, that the earlier changes are made, the less painful they have to be.Here American liberalism risks becoming a victim of its own longstanding strategy's success. Having insisted on making programs the costly core of the modern welfare state, on the famous theory that "programs for the poor become poor programs," they find themselves defending those universal (and therefore universally-popular) programs at the expense of every other kind of government spending - including, yes, programs for the poor. The insistence on ring-fencing entitlements, then, is a classic example of putting liberal political interests ahead of left-wing policy priorities. It's left Democrats defending programs that often just end up redistributing money from the younger middle class to the older middle class while accepting caps on programs that might do more (both directly and indirectly) to help downscale Americans get ahead. And by postponing any reckoning with the cost of entitlements, it's making it more likely that the inevitable crunch will hit the poorest recipients of Medicare and Social Security harder than it should.
As Ramesh Ponnuru suggests, this is a tension that conservatives should exploit in the negotiations to come:
... the obvious liberal strategy will be to set pro-defense and anti-tax activists against each other. The price of staving off cuts to defense, they will say to defense hawks, is a balanced deal from the supercommittee that includes net tax increases. The price of keeping taxes low, they will say to anti-taxers, is to accept cuts in defense ...
But it seems as though there is an obvious counter-strategy: Pit domestic discretionary spending against middle-class entitlement spending. Liberals know that middle-class entitlement spending is more valuable to them politically, but they care more about discretionary spending. So the Republicans could hold the line on taxes while also advancing entitlement reforms that (1) spare the poor as much as possible, (2) yield savings within the budget window, and (3) don't cross any ideological red lines for the Democrats. I think the Coburn-Lieberman Medicare reforms, though not perfect, would be a good template for Republicans on the commission to work with.
In effect the Republicans would be saying: Accept these entitlement reforms, or we'll let the automatic cuts to both defense and domestic discretionary spending become law and see which side is more likely to get those cuts reversed in the political process.The difficulty with executing this strategy, of course, is that the popularity of universal entitlements makes loath to touch them as well ...

HEADLINE: A Lie That Was 'Literally True'

BYLINE: FLOYD NORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: An appeals court reverses a ruling that let Marc Gabelli, a fund manager, off the hook for concealing that his fund allowed a favored hedge fund to profit at other investors' expense.

 BODY:
Remember market timing?
That was a financial scandal before Wall Street brought on the collapse of the economy. Some mutual funds allowed favored customers to trade mutual funds based on stale prices. In many cases, this involved funds that invest in foreign securities, where a lot of news may have happened after the stocks stopped trading in their home countries but before the 4 p.m. New York deadline. The effect is to transfer money from other investors in the fund to the market timers.
One example was the Gabelli Global Growth Fund, known as GGGF, run by Marc Gabelli, the son of Mario Gabelli, the founder of the Gabelli Funds. He told the fund's board that the fund was diligently seeking to stop investors from market timing, and that was true, with one not-so-minor exception. He allowed a favored hedge fund to do it hundreds of times. That fund made money in the fund; other investors lost money. The hedge fund effectively paid off Gabelli by investing in a Gabelli hedge fund.
When market timing became an issue in 2003, the fund reassured investors that management was on the case, in a memo signed by Bruce Alpert, the chief operating officer of Gabelli Funds, that said market timers were really scalpers: 
For more than two years, scalpers have been identified and restricted or banned from making further trades. Purchases from accounts with a history of frequent trades were rejected. . . . While these procedures were in place they did not completely eliminate all timers.
The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil suit against Mr. Gabelli and Mr. Alpert, only to have a federal judge, Deborah Batts, dismiss the suit. That judge concluded the letter was "literally true," and thus not misleading. After all, some market traders were blocked, and the funds admitted that some succeeded.On Monday the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed that decision, in a ruling by another district judge, Ned Rakoff, who was temporarily sitting on the appellate court:
"The law is well settled, however, that so-called "half truths" -- literally true statements that create a materially misleading impression -- will support claims for securities fraud." 
Judge Rakoff concluded that "a reasonable investor reading the Memorandum would conclude that the Adviser had attempted in good faith to reduce or eliminate GGGF market timing across the board, whereas, as Alpert well knew but failed to disclose, the Adviser had expressly agreed to let one major investor . . . engage in a very large amount of GGGF market timing."
The case will thus be able to go to trial. But I find it amazing that this appeal was necessary. Given the facts as alleged by the S.E.C. (and the judge has to assume they are accurate in considering a dismissal motion), it is hard to imagine a less absurd conclusion than the one reached by Judge Batts.

HIGHLIGHT: Tree-planting programs not only hire parolees, but give them a sense of kinship with nature that may help prevent recidivism.

 BODY:
This spring, James Sweat planted saplings in the grassy shoulder of Jewell Street in New Haven -- English oak, scarlet oak, northern red oak and pink spire crabapple. Wearing a white T-shirt, black jeans and thin wire glasses, he paused to smoke a cigarette and sip a beer. "If you saw me on the street, you know, you wouldn't think I'm a criminal," he said.
With four other former prison inmates, Mr. Sweat, 23, was working for the Urban Resources Initiative, a New Haven nonprofit affiliated with Yale University that marries the goal of reintegrating prisoners into society with urban forestry through its GreenSkills program. The crew of five men planted about a dozen trees a day in New Haven, nudging the city closer to its goal of planting 10,000 new trees by 2014.
To some, the sight of toughened and tattooed men from prison pruning trees, tipping water cans and gently tamping soil may seem a bit incongruous. But Urban Resources Initiative and a growing group of organizations across the country are testing the premise that such efforts can restore urban ecosystems and give inmates a sense of stability and purpose.
The programs are proving all the more pragmatic, advocates say, as cities and states contend with steep budget deficits and prison systems struggle with populations that are far beyond capacity. Last year the national prison population shrank for the first time in 39 years as officials, seeking in some cases to reduce overcrowding, released more than 600,000 inmates.With the unemployment rate above 9 percent, these former inmates are at a greater disadvantage than most in seeking work. "The question is, what are we going to do with all of these people?" said Colleen Murphy-Dunning, the director of Urban Resources Initiative. "What are they going to do with themselves?"
Ex-convicts have an average unemployment rate of 50 percent. James Jiler, former director of a two-acre garden and farm at the Rikers Island jail complex in New York City, says that this remains a central challenge for parolees. "Idle hands are the devil's playground," he said. "If these men and women don't have steady work, they may find ways to occupy themselves that are not so productive."
Recidivism rates top 60 percent in some states. Yet studies of employed ex-convicts have found that their recidivism rate is less than half that of all released prisoners.
Advocates like Ms. Murphy-Dunning and Mr. Jiler say that the work does far more than simply occupy a worker's time and pay a salary, however. "There is something integral about our connection with nature," Mr. Jiler said. Gardening, he said, "offers the peace and tranquility necessary for these folks to get beyond other issues in their lives."
Horticultural therapy is quite literally ancient history: centuries ago, Chinese Taoists lauded the benefits of gardens and greenhouses. In the 1699 edition of "The English Gardener," the writer Leonard Meager declared that "there is no better way to preserve your health" than spend time in a garden.
In 1984 the Harvard entomologist E.O. Wilson coined the term biophilia to describe the innate human "tendency to focus on life and lifelike processes" and to bond with the natural world. "Our existence depends on this propensity," Dr. Wilson wrote. "Our spirit is woven from it, hope rises on its currents."
After years of working in factories, James Cunningham served five years in prison. At age 34, he returned to Newark and began a six-month internship with the New Jersey Tree Foundation, where he is now employed full-time. He cares for thousands of trees, helps maintain a nursery and leads two planting crews of parolees in the spring and autumn. "Now I love getting up and going to work," he said. "This job gives me an overall respect for life."
On days off, Mr. Cunningham occasionally drives through town with his daughter as if through an art gallery, pointing to and naming the trees that he has planted. "I'm proud of that," he said.
In an era of shrinking budgets, such programs can also prove less costly for cities and states than hiring private contractors to plant and maintain trees. It's "a lot less costly than the private sector," Ms. Murphy-Dunning said of groups like hers.
Ben Falk, founder and director of Whole Systems Design, a sustainable landscaping company in Vermont's Mad River Valley, says that such programs are ultimately about "healing the land and the people simultaneously." He is working with the Southeast State Correctional Facility in Windsor, Vt., to redevelop 450 acres of state-owned land as a working farm tended by inmates.
"In our prisons we're not rehabilitating prisoners effectively; on our land we're not growing what we need to live anymore," Mr. Falk said. "We need to move toward a solution that works synergistically with these problems."

HEADLINE: Pentagon Seeks a Few Good Social Networkers

BYLINE: DAVID STREITFELD


HIGHLIGHT: The Pentagon is looking for social networking experts to help it identify and fight future conflicts.

 BODY:
The Pentagon is developing plans to use social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter as both a resource and a weapon in future conflicts. Its research and development agency is offering $42 million in funding to anyone who can help.
Social media will change the nature of warfare just as surely as the telegraph, the radio and the telephone did, and the Pentagon is fearful of being caught short. Some of its goals were laid out in a document being circulated among potential researchers and is to be presented at a briefing on Tuesday in Arlington, Va., at the offices of the military contractor System Planning Corporation.
As social media play increasingly large roles in fomenting unrest in countries like Egypt and Iran, the military wants systems to be able to detect and track the spread of ideas both quickly and on a broad scale. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is soliciting innovative proposals to help build what would be, at its most basic level, an Internet meme tracker.
It would be useful to know, for instance, whether signs of widespread rebellion were authentic or whether they were being created by a fringe group with little real support. Among the tools the successful seeker of government funding might choose to employ: linguistic cues, patterns of information flow, topic trend analysis, sentiment detection and opinion mining.
Social networks can allow the military not only to follow but also to shape the action. In its 37-page solicitation, Darpa described how a would-be high-technology lynching was foiled: "Rumors about the location of a certain individual began to spread in social media space and calls for storming the rumored location reached a fever pitch. By chance, responsible authorities were monitoring the social media,detected the crisis building, sent out effective messaging to dispel the rumors and averted a physical attack on the rumored location." 
(Is this a reference to Osama bin Laden or someone much more obscure? Were the "responsible authorities" trying to put off an attack because the individual was not at the location, or because he was? Darpa officials did not return e-mails requesting comment.) 
The crisis was formed, observed, understood and diffused entirely within social media, the solicitation noted. But the success of the authorities was a fluke, the result of "luck and unsophisticated manual methods." 
All the more urgent, then, is the need to analyze what is happening and to fight back by countermessaging. A successful program would influence attitudes through methods including automatically generating content, formerly known as spam, and "inducing identities," which might be whipping up fake combatants. 
All of this cyberwarfare will, of course, make it even less clear what is real and what is synthetic on the Internet, but that is not the military's problem and was possibly inevitable anyway. As Admiral Nimitz of the United States Navy wrote in 1948, "Technology in warfare, as in all else, has simplified some details but greatly complicated the aggregate."
Interested participants will have to hurry. Preliminary proposals are due in the coming weeks. Darpa warned that projects that were merely evolutionary would be nonstarters.

HEADLINE: Somali Agony and the Outside World

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Considering the roots of Somalia's famine.

 BODY:
Aug. 3, 9:12 a.m. | Updated belowIn absorbing the horrors being inflicted on the people of southern Somalia by their Shabab Islamist tormenters, I was reminded of a meeting I covered in 2008 for an article called "Failed States, Disasters and 'Preventive Action'" and I was irked by recent efforts to link this catastrophe to human-driven climate change. That is an unsupported distraction from the causes, and any talk of addressing this crisis.
First, a look back at the meeting on failed states. The crisis at that time was cholera in Zimbabwe, but the "Center for Preventive Action Symposium" at the Council on Foreign Relations was exploring core issues relevant in Somalia today.
Here are a couple of excerpts from my article: One discussion centered on creating an international mechanism for humanitarian intervention when a malfunctioning nation's leadership fails to address a building crisis like the cholera outbreak in Zimbabwe, or when it consciously abuses its people by conducting or abetting mass killings...
But when the world watches avoidable disasters unfolding in plain sight, what should be done? With global media and Web connectedness, everyone -- to some extent -- bears witness to starvation or genocide or the like. Awareness comes with responsibility....
Former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright proposed an intermediate step through which rich countries could help speed the progress of poorer ones, creating new ways citizens can serve overseas to help foster freedom, economic development, and improve lives.
She summarized that thought quite simply: "There is a vast gap between the Marine Corps and the Peace Corps. We need to fill that gap...." Read her prepared remarks.Now, to human-driven climate change and this crisis.
It's clear the region is seeing an extreme dry spell, but the cause of this famine is the Shabab, as Jeffrey Gettleman explains in The Times: "Much of the Horn of Africa, which includes Kenya, Somalia, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Djibouti, has been struck this summer by one of the worst droughts in 60 years. But two Shabab-controlled parts of southern Somalia are the only areas where the United Nations has declared a famine, using scientific criteria of death and malnutrition rates."
For the moment, the science is mixed on how the greenhouse-driven heating of the planet might affect east African patterns of drought.
The section on African impacts in the 2007 reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded, for example (italics below are mine):More people in eastern and western Africa will be likely to experience rather than an increase in water stress.But a paper published in January in Climate Dynamics found a link between warming of the Indian Ocean and drought patterns in Ethiopia and Kenya. Here's a recent Voice of America interview with one of the authors, Chris Funk, and a description of the work by his co-author A. Park Williams.
Over all, in considering policy options related to African progress, it's vital to keep in mind that the climate history of peri-Saharan regions includes millenniums-long patterns of mega-drought far more extreme than anything experienced in modern times.
Combine that reality with the prospect of populations doubling by 2050 and the persistence of anarchy in vulnerable regions, and any impact from human-driven climate change has to be considered a background issue, at best, compared to the forces already killing thousands and deepening vulnerability of millions more.
Aug. 3, 8:36 a.m. Addendum:
Chris Funk, who is in the Climate Hazard Group at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and is affiliated with the U.S. Geological Survey, has a compelling commentary on the unfolding disaster on the Nature Web site under the headline "We Thought Trouble Was Coming" (unfortunately behind the subscription wall). It describes how his research linking warming Indian Ocean temperatures, when combined with La Nina conditions, to reductions in crucial rainfall from March to June in East Africa. But more important, it describes the value of the integrated analysis being done by the Famine Early Warning Systems Network, organized by the United States Agency for International Development to try to cut the chances of a predicted drought like the present one spawning a famine. 
Funk's piece asks the vital question, "So what went wrong? Why weren't the warnings - before and duringthe drought - enough to avert a food crisis that might turn into famine?"
Noting that politics and the lack of governance are a prime driver of the famine, he also asserts that over-reliance on the climate panel's African analysis above lulled some agencies into discounting drought risks in East Africa, even though observations showed a drying trend in spring. Funk says this could be doubly damaging if present plans to expand agriculture in the region in anticipation of a wetter climate (as discussed in the intergovernmental panel report) run into new drier norms instead.
He points to the lack of close-focus climate analysis in the region, which was a point made in "The Climate Divide," our 2007 special report on the outsize vulnerability to climate change in places like sub-Saharan Africa.
Funk also points to the combination of rapid population growth and low agricultural productivity in the region, which has greatly amplified the potential for starvation. 
Combining all these elements with the tendency toward drying that he links to human-driven warming of Indian Ocean waters and you have what's in the headlines -- with more to come.
He says with improved climate information, increased agricultural productivity and integrated African markets and grain and water storage could boost resilience in the region. 
"Better regional climate-change and forecast models, combined with more effective agriculture in drought-threatened areas will not solve all problems, but they should reduce the need for emergency responses, and make such measures more effective when they are necessary," he concludes.
Of course, none of these steps will be of much use for the suffering people of southern Somalia as long as extremist, exploitative warlords rule their lives.

HEADLINE: Why Would a Fiscal Commission Work This Time?

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: On Capitol Hill, legislators are fuming about being stripped of their power by a bipartisan fiscal "super-committee." But such commissions in the past have been generally powerless.

 BODY:
Here on Capitol Hill, legislators are fuming about being stripped of their power by a new bipartisan fiscal "super-committee." But history shows that such commissions have been generally powerless.
In the last six decades, Washington has assembled more than a dozen blue-ribbon panels to grapple with fiscal problems. These include the 1947-49 Hoover Commission, the 1982-84 Grace Commission and of course most recently, the Simpson-Bowles Commission, a bipartisan panel President Obama created by executive order just last year that included 12 sitting members of Congress. (If I were Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles -- the namesakes of that task force -- I might be a little peeved that my colleagues are effectively repeating the exercise that I spent so much time on last year.)
The panels were often devised as a way to give political cover to policy makers so they could make unpopular changes to things like entitlements and tax rates. In most cases, though, Congress ignored the proposals or deferred action.
Even the panel usually held up as the exception that proved the rule, the 1981-83 Greenspan Commission set up to revamp Social Security, was also largely a failure.
According to an unpublished memoir written by one of the now-deceased members of the commission, the panel deadlocked and then splintered. President Reagan and the House leadership were able to eke out a deal to save Social Security only by engaging in separate negotiations just as the entitlement program was about to go bankrupt.
"Most of these deficit commissions have ended up exactly the way Simpson-Bowles did: with lots of talk, lots of congratulations and no actual changes," said Bruce Bartlett, a former economic adviser to Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush (and regular contributor to this blog).
Many of these commissions have issued the exact same recommendations as their predecessors, he said, only to have them disregarded once again.
"They keep appointing new commissions to reinvent the wheel," Mr. Bartlett said.
And indeed, there are many reasons to believe that Congress's current (and past) fiscal challenges are due less to a lack of economic ingenuity than to a lack of political will, a will that the creation of a commission does nothing to strengthen.
After all, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office publishes an enormous tome of "Budget Options" nearly every year for the primary purpose of letting legislators know what choices they have for fiscal consolidation strategies. Just about every permutation of tax change and spending cut is cataloged, analyzed and scored for deficit savings.
The one design element of the current fiscal super-committee proposal that bodes well is its so-called trigger function.
The only fiscal task force that economists and political historians say worked somewhat reliably was one with a similar model: a commission set up to determine which military bases closed.
Politicians are loath to vote for closing any individual base within their own district, so this commission put together a master list of military bases that were good candidates for being shut down. And if Congress did nothing, every base on the list closed. That meant the onus was on opponents to act to prevent the commission's recommendations from taking effect.
The model was quite effective for many years.
"The deck was really stacked against the plan's opponents then," said Sarah Binder, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a political science historian at George Washington University.
The current fiscal commission requires Congress to approve the commission's recommendations -- but if it does not do so, major deficit cuts will kick in automatically. In other words, like the base-closing commission model, Congress will have to act affirmatively to undo that legislative language if it wants no new spending cuts or tax increases to take effect.
"Expedited procedures count for a lot, and triggers count for a lot, if they can get them to work," Professor Binder said. "All these delegated panels involve kicking the can down the road, but this one tries to make that can explode if gets kicked."

HEADLINE: He's Led a City. Why Not an Orchestra?

BYLINE: SAM ROBERTS


HIGHLIGHT: The mayor is to conduct the Encores! orchestra at the reopening of City Center. Not bad for a guy who quit piano lessons after a year.

 BODY:
He may strike some New Yorkers as a one-man band whose occasional off-key comments can strike a discordant note, but that won't stop Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg from conducting an orchestra Oct. 25 to celebrate the reopening of City Center. Not bad for a guy who quit piano lessons after a year because he hated to practice and whose favorite piece remains the C major scale. 
In homage to the dedication of the West 55th Street building in 1943 by his predecessor Fiorello H. La Guardia, Mr. Bloomberg will conduct the Encores! orchestra at the gala reopening to start a celebratory season at the landmark city-owned hall originally built as the Ancient Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine in 1923.
The renovation cost $75 million, nearly half committed by the city. 
"City Center occupies a special place in the lives of New Yorkers as the diverse and accessible 'People's Theater' founded by Mayor La Guardia," Mr. Bloomberg said in a statement Tuesday. "Generations of New Yorkers flocked to City Center to see performances by many of the world's greatest artists and companies. The city of New York is proud to help City Center remain a vibrant cultural attraction for generations to come." 
The program, still unspecified, includes "performances, reminiscences and tributes by stars of dance and theater."
 The renovation includes a new marquee and facade, a redesigned lobby and a restored auditorium including new seating. 
 Just how authentically the mayor will wield his baton on opening night is open to question. Last year, at the Mayor's Awards for Arts and Culture, he was photographed at the piano in a duet with the actress Meryl Streep, although his hands never actually touched the keys. That apparently was out of deference to the audience at Lincoln Center. ("I love a piano," the mayor once explained, "which is why I don't play it.")
 Andrew Brent, a spokesman for the mayor, declined to elaborate on Mr. Bloomberg's expertise as a conductor, except to offer this comparison: "Do you remember Leonard Bernstein's historic conducting of Verdi's Requiem in 1967? No? Good."

HEADLINE: Corzine for a Washington Job? A 1% Solution

BYLINE: DEALBOOK


HIGHLIGHT: MF Global's offering for five-year notes says it will pay investors more if its chief executive leaves for a federal position by 2013.

 BODY:
Is Jon S. Corzine on the short list to replace Timothy F. Geithner as Treasury secretary? 
A preliminary prospectus filed on Tuesday by MF Global, where Mr. Corzine, the former Democratic governor and senator from New Jersey is now chief executive, suggests that just may be a possibility. 
MF Global is planning to sell five-year notes on Tuesday with an unusual twist: the notes will pay an extra 1 percent in the interest rate "upon the departure of Mr. Corzine as our full time chief executive officer due to his appointment to a federal position by the President of the United States and confirmation of that appointment by the United States Senate prior to July 1, 2013," according to the offering.
The language in the clause -- called a "key man event" -- is more specific than that in Mr. Corzine's employment contract, filed in March, which spelled out his conditions for receiving a retention bonus in 2014. He could receive partial payment if he left to "accept employment at any U.S. Federal, state or local government, any agency or instrumentality of any such government, or a widely recognized non-governmental or public policy organization," according to a company filing.
As Theo Francis of Footnoted pointed out at the time, the clause is "so broadly written, it would seem to apply even if he left for some less august job, such as mayor of tiny Barnegat Light, New Jersey, (pop. 835)." 
So perhaps the filing language has only become more precisely realistic, rather than handicapping his chances. 
Still, Mr. Corzine, as a former senator, might have a better chance of getting through the nomination process than some other possible candidates for Treasury secretary. The New York Post reported last month that President Obama had turned to Mr. Corzine to help raise reelection campaign funds from the financial industry. 
Mr. Obama had campaigned for Mr. Corzine in 2009 during his bid to be reelected governor of New Jersey. Several months after losing the election to Chris Christie, Mr. Corzine was named chief executive of MF Global, a huge commodities and derivatives broker. 
Yet there would certainly be reluctance to nominate a former chief executive of Goldman Sachs at a time when the firm is such a lightning rod for controversy. For that reason, he was not seen as a leading candidate when reports emerged early last month that Mr. Geithner was weighing stepping down after a debt deal was reached. The Treasury Secretary said at the time that he was planning to stay in the job "for the foreseeable future."
The Wall Street Journal online earlier reported the clause in the prospectus.

HEADLINE: Senate Committee Advances C.F.T.C. Nominee

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: The Senate Agriculture Committee on Tuesday approved Mark Wetjen, President Obama's pick for the newest member of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, an increasingly powerful agency at the center of the financial regulatory overhaul.

 BODY:
The Senate Agriculture Committee on Tuesday approved President Obama's pick for the newest member of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, an increasingly powerful agency at the center of the financial regulatory overhaul.
Mark Wetjen, 37, now awaits confirmation from the full Senate. His chances there are uncertain.
The Congressional Democratic aide is popular on Capitol Hill and his bid recently earned a crucial endorsement from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a fierce opponent of many new financial regulations.
But Republican lawmakers loathe giving the commodity commission a win while it is carrying out the Dodd-Frank law's broad mandate. The law requires the commission to write more than 50 new rules for the derivatives market, a leading cause of the financial crisis. 
Republicans complain that the agency's rules are convoluted and overly strict. 
Dodd-Frank is familiar territory for Mr. Wetjen, who helped write the law as a top aide to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada. Before joining Mr. Reid's staff in 2004, Mr. Wetjen worked at a series of law firms. Mr. Obama nominated him to be a C.F.T.C. commissioner in May. 
"He was a lawyer doing extremely well, very productive, making good money," Mr. Reid said last month at his aide's confirmation hearing. "But Mark Wetjen has always wanted to be in some form of public service."
Mr. Wetjen would replace Commissioner Michael Dunn, also a Democrat whose tenure expired in June. Mr. Dunn is planning to stay on at the commission until his spot is filled. 
The agency is run by give commissioners -- two Republicans and three Democrats, including Chairman Gary Gensler.

HEADLINE: For Stocks, Day 7 Since the Walkout

BYLINE: FLOYD NORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: Stocks have fallen every trading day since Speaker John Boehner walked out of the White House talks on July 22. The debt deal that eventually emerged has revived recession talk.

 BODY:
Today was the seventh trading day since John Boehner walked out of talks with Barack Obama at the White House. That move made it clear that the House speaker would not risk alienating the Tea Party and that if a debt default were to be averted, the president would have to capitulate on virtually all issues or defy Congress by claiming the debt limit legislation was unconstitutional. He chose to capitulate.
This is also the seventh consecutive session that the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has declined. The total fall for the seven days is 6.8 percent.
This is something that Wall Street did not see coming. It took for granted that something more reasonable would be worked out. To make it worse, the economic data has turned much bleaker, highlighted by last Friday's revisions in the gross domestic product. In normal times, the politicians would be vying to come up with plans to stimulate the economy. Now that seems to be out of the question, and there is more talk of a double-dip recession than at any time since the last downturn ended. 
The last time I can recall Wall Street's being so wrong about what the government would do was in September 2008. Lehman Brothers was collapsing, but the Bear Stearns precedent provided assurance that the government would not take the risks to the financial system inherent in letting a big bank fail.
Over the seven sessions after the Lehman bankruptcy, the S.&.P fell 5.1 percent. It was a much wilder ride than this one, with two days when the market lost more than 4 percent and two days when it rose more than 4 percent. The market would go on to lose much more. By contrast, the largest decline in this string was today's fall of 2.6 percent.
Wall Street was so very wrong in 2008 because ideology trumped caution in Washington. Sort of like what seems to be happening now.

HEADLINE: Debt Compromise Is Just 'First Step,' Says Obama

BYLINE: MARK LANDLER


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama said Washington should quickly pivot to job creation efforts and that future deficit reduction should include both spending cuts and new tax revenue.

 BODY:
President Obama, speaking minutes after the Senate voted to raise the debt ceiling, said the measure had averted an economic calamity but warned it would do little to revive the lagging economy or create jobs.
Issuing a fresh challenge to an exhausted Congress, Mr. Obama said the two parties would need to work out a second set of deficit-reduction measures that must include both spending cuts and new tax revenue.
"It is an important first step to insuring that as a nation, we live within our means," Mr. Obama said of the agreement, under a sweltering midday sun in the White House Rose Garden.
But he added, "Growing the economy isn't just about cutting spending. That's not how we're going to get past this recession. We're going to have to do more than that."
Mr. Obama recited a familiar list of remedies, ranging from Congressional approval of trade deals, speeding up approval of patent applications, and investment in infrastructure projects. He also called for increased benefits for the unemployed and promised to set out new ideas in the coming weeks.
Looking ahead to the next round of deficit negotiations, Mr. Obama said, "We need a balanced approach, where everything is on the table," including the elimination of tax loopholes and new revenue from an overhaul of the tax code.
Reprising arguments that he used unsuccessfully during negotiations with House Republicans, the president said, "We can't balance the budget on the backs of the very people who have borne the brunt of the recession."
For Mr. Obama, the Senate vote brought to an end a grueling, months-long negotiation in which he conceded some key issues, not least his demand that the package include tax revenues as well as spending cuts. Mr. Obama's tone was grim and betrayed little sense of accomplishment. He said the spectacle of the long negotiations had left American public bewildered and dismayed.
"Voters may have chosen divided government," he said, "but they sure didn't choose dysfunctional government."
The president is counting on a second round of haggling, to be conducted by a Congressional panel this year, to produce measures he failed to get in the initial phase of the package. Now, Mr. Obama must sell the deal to his political base as well as the broader American public. That process will begin on Wednesday in Chicago, when he plans to speak at a Democratic Party fund-raiser, which will also serve as a celebration of the president's 50th birthday, the next day.
By compromising with House Republicans on a plan to avoid a potentially ruinous national default, Mr. Obama will seek to present himself as a responsible leader who rises above partisan politics -- a message tailor-made for independent voters. But the deal left many Democrats angry, and analysts said Mr. Obama would need to devote some of his time to shoring up his political base.
While Mr. Obama said the deal lifted a cloud of uncertainty from the American economy, it could complicate the president's near-term efforts to jump-start the economy, because it cuts government spending and does not include provisions like an extension of the cut in the payroll tax, which could stimulate hiring.

But the deal left many Democrats angry, and analysts said Mr. Obama would need to devote some of his time to shoring up his political base.
While Mr. Obama said the deal lifted a cloud of uncertainty from the American economy, it could complicate his short-term efforts to jump-start the economy, because it cuts government spending and does not include provisions that could stimulate hiring, like an extension of the payroll tax cut.

HEADLINE: Ex-Directors of Failed Firms Have Little to Fear

BYLINE: STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF


HIGHLIGHT: A look at the career paths of onetime Enron directors indicates that the former directors of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers may not have much to worry about.

 BODY:
Do the former directors of the institutions that collapsed during the financial crisis have anything to worry about? If the experience of Enron is any example, the answer is a resounding no.
A look back at the career paths of onetime Enron directors indicates that the former directors of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers will continue their prominent careers.
Enron collapsed into bankruptcy in 2001 amid accusations of accounting improprieties and outright fraud. The scandal sent shock waves through corporate America, but compared with the global financial crisis, it almost seems small and quaint.
Still, in the case of Enron, unlike in the financial crisis, top corporate executives went to prison. Most prominently, Jeffrey Skilling, a former chief executive of Enron, was sentenced to 24 years in prison.
Yet while some Enron executives paid a price for the scandal, it is a different story with Enron's former directors - the people charged with overseeing the company. A search of their current whereabouts shows that they have recovered nicely from the scandal.
Four former Enron directors still serve on public boards. Frank Savage, for example, still heads his own investment firm and serves on the boards of Bloomberg L.P. and Lockheed Martin. Norman P. Blake Jr. serves on the board of Owens Corning, where he is the head of that company's audit committee.
A number have gone back to or entered academia. Wendy Gramm, the wife of the former senator Phil Gramm, vice chairman of UBS investment bank, is still in residence at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University.
Robert K. Jaedicke, who was chairman of Enron's audit committee, teaches at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business. And Lord John Wakeham has remained chancellor of Brunel University in London.
The private sector Enron directors also continued their careers without much of a hiccup. Ken L. Harrison retired as chief executive of the Portland General Electric Company last year. And Ronnie C. Chan has remained chairman of the Hang Lung Group in Hong Kong since Enron's collapse.
Most of the remaining directors have since retired or now work in small private or family businesses, a euphemism for semiretirement.
John Mendelsohn, for example, is to retire next month as head of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.
Then there is Rebecca Mark-Jusbasche. She was named one of the "luckiest persons in Houston" by Fortune magazine. Ms. Mark-Jusbasche left the Enron board in 2000, selling more than $80 million worth of company stock. She now runs family properties in New Mexico and Colorado.
A few of the directors conveniently omit Enron from their biographies, but they do not appear to remain tainted, staying in their chosen professions.
The only court penalty placed upon them was related to a $165 million settlement of shareholder litigation arising from Enron's demise. The directors personally had to pay a relatively large $13 million. The rest was covered by insurance.
The experiences of the Enron directors over the last decade would appear to offer great hope to the directors of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers.
Indeed, many of these directors remain not only as directors of public companies from before the financial crisis, but they have joined new boards. Even Alan Greenberg is still on the Viacom board with a fellow Bear board alumnus, Frederic V. Salerno, who serves on six public company boards. In all, 6 of the 12 Bear directors at the time of the investment bank's collapse are still directors of public companies.
None of the Bear directors have appeared to have career difficulties. The two academics on the board were the Rev. Donald J. Harrington, who remains the president of St. John's University, and Henry S. Bienen, who is emeritus president of Northwestern University. Frank T. Nickell is still chief executive, president and chairman of Kelso & Company, while Paul A. Novelly remains C.E.O. of the Apex Oil Company.
In fact, with the exception of James E. Cayne, none are fully retired or appear to be having trouble finding good positions.
It is the same for Lehman Brothers, with Richard S. Fuld Jr., the former chief executive, bearing the brunt of the public approbation. He is at his own firm, Matrix Advisors, and - fairly or unfairly - remains the focus of blame for Lehman's demise.
As for the other Lehman directors, six of them held directorships as recently as January. Jerry A. Grundhofer was appointed to the Citigroup board after Lehman's fall. He has since resigned from that board, but he remains on the boards of EcoLab and the Midland Company. Roland A. Hernandez joined the Sony board and still remains on the boards of MGM Mirage, the Ryland Group and Vail Resorts.
The rest of the board members were mostly private investors. Roger S. Berlind was and still is a theatrical producer. Michael L. Ainslie, former chief executive of Sotheby's, is a private investor. Christopher Gent is a senior adviser to the consulting group Bain & Company as well as nonexecutive chairman of GlaxoSmithKline.
So the Bear and Lehman directors are returning to public company service even quicker than the Enron directors. In part this reflects the old boy network on Wall Street, which keeps people in the same positions because of friendships. It is not a coincidence that two former Bear Stearns directors serve on the Viacom board.
The trend also underscores the decline in the importance of reputation on Wall Street - even since the time of Enron. Prior bad conduct simply is often not viewed as a problem.
But in the case of the Bear and Lehman directors there is another significant factor. The financial crisis was an enormously complex event, and people will be debating its causes for years to come. Blame can be dispersed, and an executive or director can simply say it was the crisis itself - not poor management or inadequate board supervision - that caused their firm's demise.
I am not arguing that these directors be tarred and feathered or that they should not be able to earn a living, but rather that there should be market penalties for failure - just as Ms. Gramm's Mercatus Center often argues. At a minimum, one would think that other public companies might be more hesitant to keep these failed directors on their boards.
In the end, the directors of companies that failed in the financial crisis will most likely receive an even freer pass than the Enron directors.

HEADLINE: Despite Rising U.S. Sales, Automakers Are Struggling

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
DETROIT -- Sales of new vehicles in the United States rose in July but were still hampered by economic concerns and low inventories of many Japanese models.
Honda and Toyota each reported large declines, as they have each month since production was slowed by the earthquake and tsunami in March. Toyota said it did not expect to post a year-over-year increase until early 2012. Sales fell 28.4 percent at Honda and 22.7 percent at Toyota.
Most other major carmakers reported modest increases, including gains of 7.6 percent for General Motors and 6.1 percent for the Ford Motor Company, which included 2010 sales by the Volvo brand, which it has since sold. Nissan, which avoided significant disruption after the earthquake, said sales were up 2.7 percent and even surpassed Honda to rank as the nation's fifth-largest seller. 
Chrysler's sales rose 20.1 percent, but the head of its United States sales division, Reid Bigland, described the market as ''tougher than a cheap steak.'' Over all, light-vehicle sales rose 0.9 percent.
''The recovery is clearly in a stall mode,'' said Paul Ballew, the chief economist at Nationwide Insurance and a former G.M. sales analyst. ''It's hard to see sales sprinting forward without some help on job and income growth. There's a lot of wind that's really out of the consumer's sails right now.''
The seasonally adjusted, annualized sales rate climbed to 12.23 million in July, the highest since April, according to the industry tracking firm Autodata. The rate, a closely watched indication of the industry's health, was 11.55 million a year ago and 11.45 million in June.
Analysts said they expected sales to rebound somewhat in the coming months but remain below the levels experienced in the first quarter, which would make for a disappointing end to a year that began with considerable promise.
Increases in unemployment and economic fears caused by the debt-ceiling debate in Washington were among the factors deterring car shoppers in July, analysts said. Even though Congressional leaders reached a last-minute deal to avoid a federal default, the issue will continue to cast a shadow on auto sales, said John Hoffecker, a managing director of the restructuring firm AlixPartners.
''What it brought to the forefront in many people's minds is the shape the country is in, and raising the ceiling does not solve those concerns,'' Mr. Hoffecker said. ''We don't see a significant pickup happening between now and the end of the year.''
In addition, the Japanese automakers still are working to replenish inventories of popular vehicles like the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry. Honda has said it expects plants to be essentially back to normal this month, and Toyota has said full output would resume by September.
But Randy Pflughaupt, a group vice president for Toyota's United States sales administration, said dealer inventories would remain below year-ago levels through the end of the year.
Peter Nesvold, an analyst with Jefferies and Company, wrote in a report last week that ''the Japanese companies should start to regain some of the market share lost over the past four months as production and inventory gradually improve.'' Mr. Nesvold forecast that September would be the first month since April in which sales reflected true demand rather than low inventories.
Meanwhile, Toyota and Honda have been piling on discounts in the hopes of encouraging consumers to make a purchase. Incentives on Japanese vehicles were 24.5 percent higher in July than in June, at an average of nearly $2,000 per vehicle, according to Edmunds.com. That compares to an increase of 7.6 percent in incentives on all vehicles.
''With production working its way back to normal, the Japanese are making a strong play for their lost market share and American automakers may need to kick in more incentives as they fight for more consumers,'' said Jessica Caldwell, a senior analyst at Edmunds.com, a Web site that provides car-buying advice for consumers.
Ford and G.M. have been affected by inventory issues, as well. Their most fuel-efficient models, including the Ford Focus and Chevrolet Cruze compact cars, have become scarce as consumers seek refuge from high gas prices, but the companies have been reluctant to add extra shifts given the fragile state of the economy. Instead, they are trying to increase output through lower-cost, less permanent actions like running some plants on overtime.
''We're shipping everything we can to meet consumer demand,'' said Ken Czubay, Ford's vice president for United States marketing, sales and service. ''But consumers are telling us they want two more than we can produce. We're running flat out.''
At the same time, supplies of pickup trucks and larger vehicles have been ballooning, creating concerns among analysts that the companies will start slashing prices to keep dealer lots from growing too crowded.
The uncertain sales environment cut into the second-quarter earnings reported by Ford and Chrysler last week. General Motors is expected to report a second-quarter profit on Thursday.

HEADLINE: On Boards, Little Cause For Anxiety

 BODY:
Do the former directors of the institutions that collapsed during the financial crisis have anything to worry about? If the experience of Enron is any example, the answer is a resounding no.
A look back at the career paths of onetime Enron directors indicates that the former directors of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers will continue their prominent careers.
Enron collapsed into bankruptcy in 2001 amid accusations of accounting improprieties and outright fraud. The scandal sent shock waves through corporate America, but compared with the global financial crisis, it almost seems small and quaint. 
Still, in the case of Enron, unlike in the financial crisis, top corporate executives went to prison. Most prominently, Jeffrey Skilling, a former chief executive of Enron, was sentenced to 24 years in prison.
Yet while some Enron executives paid a price for the scandal, it is a different story with Enron's former directors - the people charged with overseeing the company. A search of their current whereabouts shows that they have recovered nicely from the scandal.
Four former Enron directors still serve on public boards. Frank Savage, for example, still heads his own investment firm and serves on the boards of Bloomberg L.P. and Lockheed Martin. Norman P. Blake Jr. serves on the board of Owens Corning, where he is the head of that company's audit committee.
A number have gone back to or entered academia. Wendy Gramm, the wife of the former senator Phil Gramm, vice chairman of UBS investment bank, is still in residence at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University.
Robert K. Jaedicke, who was chairman of Enron's audit committee, teaches at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business. And Lord John Wakeham has remained chancellor of Brunel University in London.
The private sector Enron directors also continued their careers without much of a hiccup. Ken L. Harrison retired as chief executive of the Portland General Electric Company in 2000. And Ronnie C. Chan has remained chairman of the Hang Lung Group in Hong Kong since Enron's collapse.
Most of the remaining directors have since retired or now work in small private or family businesses, a euphemism for semiretirement.
John Mendelsohn, for example, is to retire next month as head of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.
Then there is Rebecca Mark-Jusbasche. She was named one of the ''luckiest persons in Houston'' by Fortune magazine. Ms. Mark-Jusbasche left the Enron board in 2000, selling more than $80 million worth of company stock. She now runs family properties in New Mexico and Colorado.
A few of the directors conveniently omit Enron from their biographies, but they do not appear to remain tainted, staying in their chosen professions.
The only court penalty placed upon them was related to a $165 million settlement of shareholder litigation arising from Enron's demise. The directors personally had to pay a relatively large $13 million. The rest was covered by insurance.
The experiences of the Enron directors over the last decade would appear to offer great hope to the directors of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers.
Indeed, many of these directors remain not only as directors of public companies from before the financial crisis, but they have joined new boards. Even Alan Greenberg is still on the Viacom board with a fellow Bear board alumnus, Frederic V. Salerno, who serves on six public company boards. In all, 6 of the 12 Bear directors at the time of the investment bank's collapse are still directors of public companies.
None of the Bear directors have appeared to have career difficulties. The two academics on the board were the Rev. Donald J. Harrington, who remains the president of St. John's University, and Henry S. Bienen, who is emeritus president of Northwestern University. Frank T. Nickell is still chief executive, president and chairman of Kelso & Company, while Paul A. Novelly remains C.E.O. of the Apex Oil Company.
In fact, with the exception of James E. Cayne, none are fully retired or appear to be having trouble finding good positions.
It is the same for Lehman Brothers, with Richard S. Fuld Jr., the former chief executive, bearing the brunt of the public approbation. He is at his own firm, Matrix Advisors, and - fairly or unfairly - remains the focus of blame for Lehman's demise.
As for the other Lehman directors, six of them held directorships as recently as January. Jerry A. Grundhofer was appointed to the Citigroup board after Lehman's fall. He has since resigned from that board, but he remains on the boards of EcoLab and the Midland Company. Roland A. Hernandez joined the Sony board and still remains on the boards of MGM Mirage, the Ryland Group and Vail Resorts.
The rest of the board members were mostly private investors. Roger S. Berlind was and still is a theatrical producer. Michael L. Ainslie, former chief executive of Sotheby's, is a private investor. Christopher Gent is a senior adviser to the consulting group Bain & Company as well as nonexecutive chairman of GlaxoSmithKline.
So the Bear and Lehman directors are returning to public company service even quicker than the Enron directors. In part this reflects the old boy network on Wall Street, which keeps people in the same positions because of friendships. It is not a coincidence that two former Bear Stearns directors serve on the Viacom board.
The trend also underscores the decline in the importance of reputation on Wall Street - even since the time of Enron. Prior bad conduct simply is often not viewed as a problem.
But in the case of the Bear and Lehman directors there is another significant factor. The financial crisis was an enormously complex event, and people will be debating its causes for years to come. Blame can be dispersed, and an executive or director can simply say it was the crisis itself - not poor management or inadequate board supervision - that caused their firm's demise.
I am not arguing that these directors be tarred and feathered or that they should not be able to earn a living, but rather that there should be market penalties for failure - just as Ms. Gramm's Mercatus Center often argues. At a minimum, one would think that other public companies might be more hesitant to keep these failed directors on their boards.
In the end, the directors of companies that failed in the financial crisis will most likely receive an even freer pass than the Enron directors.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.
Correction: August 5, 2011, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Deal Professor column on Wednesday, about the career paths of Enron directors after the energy company collapsed in 2001, misstated the year that one former director, Ken L. Harrison, retired as chief executive of the Portland General Electric Company. It was 2000, not last year.

HEADLINE: World Markets Staggered by Weak Consumer Data: Borrowing Costs Rise for Italy and Spain

BYLINE: By LIZ ALDERMAN AND MATTHEW SALTMARSH; Liz Alderman reported from Paris, and Matthew Saltmarsh from London. Jack Ewing contributed reporting from Frankfurt, and Rachel Donadio from Rome.

 BODY:
PARIS -- Just as European markets seemed to resume their normalcy after the tumult of their sovereign debt crises, the wolves are back at the door.
Two weeks ago, the markets seemed to be on firmer footing after the new bailout of Greece was structured to prevent contagion. But on Tuesday, traders renewed their attacks on Italy and Spain pushing their borrowing costs, at least for now, to the tipping point that led Greece, Ireland and Portugal to apply for bailouts.
Some people now fear that Italy and Spain could run out of cash to meet their debt obligations in a matter of months if, like the others, they are shut out of international markets. 
JPMorgan is warning its clients that Italy and Spain have thin margins of safety. The countries ''will run out of cash in September and February respectively, if they lose access to funding markets,'' the investment bank said. Those fears risk leading to ''a self-fulfilling negative spiral,'' the bank added.
The rescue fund negotiated last month as part of the bailout of Greece was intended to increase powers to assist countries that have not been bailed out, like Spain and Italy. It was described by some as a new Marshall Plan for Europe and was supposed to keep those nations safe from the spreading fire and, by extension, cushion the many European and American banks that hold their debt.
However, some skeptics had warned that the fund would not do enough, particularly if larger economies were devoured by the debt crisis. While the economies of Greece, Ireland and Portugal are relatively small, European leaders would face challenges of a different magnitude if Italy and Spain were engulfed by the same forces. For instance, if Italy's economy stalls, higher interest rates could make it too costly to service Italy's heaving debt, which, at 119 percent of gross domestic product, is one of the world's largest.
With many Europeans off for their summer holidays, thin trading conditions may be exaggerating the market's movements this week. Still, the sense of urgency was palpable in Rome, where Giulio Tremonti, Italy's finance minister, held an emergency meeting of the country's financial authorities as interest rates on Italy's benchmark 10-year bond touched a 14-year high of 6.21 percent on Tuesday.
A leadership vacuum at the highest levels of the Italian government has further unnerved investors. Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has been silent on the debt crisis for nearly a month as he battles a sex scandal and grapples with court cases. He was scheduled to address the matter on Wednesday in a speech on the economy before Parliament.
In Madrid, Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero delayed the start of his vacation Tuesday to cope with Spain's problems even as he agreed last week to step down early to take responsibility for Spain's economic crisis.
The yield for the Spanish 10-year bond rose to 6.45 percent, the highest level since Spain joined the euro club, before retreating a bit. The surge is ill-timed because the government needs to raise as much as 3.5 billion euros (nearly $5 billion) in a bond auction Thursday.
The governments of Germany and France, the euro zone's largest economies, can hardly afford a bigger cleanup bill for Europe's debt crisis. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France hinted as much last month, telling Mr. Berlusconi in separate brief conversations that they felt sure he would do the right thing for the economy, according to a person with knowledge of the discussions.
Both Italy and Spain still need to tackle a mountain of debt and show they are making real progress toward straightening out their finances. Until that happens, investors are likely to keep driving their borrowing costs higher.
Markets are also unnerved by the prospect that creditors would share additional pain should other countries go the way of Greece. With German and French politicians pressured to show that taxpayers will not be the only ones saddled with the bailout costs, banks in those countries agreed to take some losses in the most recent bailout of Greece.
But investors have become much more nervous about the capacity of banks to take larger losses on Italian, Spanish, Irish or Portuguese debt, should such a situation arise. That has helped fan the contagion and raised the possibility of a highly expensive bank rescue operation by European taxpayers.
''The problem is we have not stopped the contagion that is putting pressure on Italy and Spain,'' said a senior European finance official involved in the rescue programs, who was not authorized to speak publicly. ''We would be confronted with enormous problems if things got worse.''
Except for German bonds, Italian debt is more widely held by European banks than any other government obligation. A default there could devastate Europe's financial system.
Europe's 90 largest banks collectively hold Italian debt with a face value of 326 billion euros, according to data collected by the European Banking Authority. That sum overshadows the 90 billion euros in Greek debt held by the largest banks. It is also much larger than European banks' holdings of Spanish or United States debt, which in both cases is about 287 billion euros.
Italian banks are by far the most exposed to their country's debt, and many have suffered sharp declines in their share price in the last month. For instance, UniCredit holds 49 billion euros, according to the banking authority.
BNP Paribas in France holds 28 billion in Italian debt euros and in Britain, HSBC has 9.9 billion euros in Italian debt and Barclays has 9.4 billion euros. By comparison, American banks hold $14.38 billion worth of Italian debt.
In a statement after the emergency meeting in Rome, officials blamed ''international uncertainties'' for their problems rather than Italy's economic fundamentals. Declaring the country's banks ''solid,'' they nonetheless said they would keep the situation ''under constant observation.''
Michael T. Darda, the chief economist at the hedge fund MKM Partners, said higher government bond yields could reduce growth in both countries, raising expectations of default, and inviting even higher yields and wider gaps in comparison with German bonds, the European benchmark.
European officials hoped they would at least be able to escape for their August vacations before returning to the line of fire. But with those kind of views spreading, traders in government debt may not give them much time to enjoy themselves.
''There are two types of players in the market, those who move out of fear and those who move out of greed,'' said the senior European finance official. ''And right now, we are seeing all of them move in the same direction.''

HEADLINE: After the High Line, Old Tracks Get Another Look

BYLINE: By KRISTINA SHEVORY

 BODY:
The High Line park, built on an elevated railway trestle in Manhattan, has become both a symbol and a catalyst for an explosion of growth in the meatpacking district and the Chelsea neighborhood.
Now cities around the country, including Chicago, Philadelphia and St. Louis, are working up plans to renovate their aging railroad trestles, tracks and railways for parkland. Cities with little public space are realizing they badly need more parks, and the High Line has taught that renovating an old railway can be the spark that helps improve a neighborhood and attract development.
The High Line's first and second sections cost $153 million, but have generated an estimated $2 billion in new developments. In the five years since construction started on the High Line, 29 new projects have been built or are under way in the neighborhood, according to the New York City Department of City Planning. More than 2,500 new residential units, 1,000 hotel rooms and over 500,000 square feet of office and art gallery space have gone up.
''Cities recognize parks are good for their economies. They're no longer a nice thing to have, but a must,'' said Will Rogers, president and chief executive of the Trust for Public Land, a national conservation group in San Francisco. 
The area around the park, sprinkled with small offices under 200,000 square feet, has become a draw for start-ups and creative companies.
''I think the High Line is a big attraction. It's created a lot more buzz to the area,'' said Matthew Bergey, first vice president at the commercial brokerage firm CB Richard Ellis in New York. ''Like with any destination, people will come if it's cool and has buzz.''
Though plans in many cities have a long way to go before becoming reality, a point in favor of reuse is that it can be cheaper to renovate old rail structures than to tear them down. The Reading Viaduct, an old elevated railway line in Philadelphia, would cost $50 million to demolish versus $36 million to retrofit, according to the Center City District, a business improvement group.
In Chicago, where a 2.65-mile elevated rail line slices through four residential areas, tearing down the line would be prohibitively costly. With 37 bridges and large earthen embankments, the Bloomingdale Trail, as it is now called, snakes east to west across Chicago and is simply too big to go.
''If you've driven around Chicago, you'll have seen it,'' said Beth White, director of the Chicago office of the Trust for Public Land, which is helping to build the trail.
As with other, similar rail lines around the country, passenger and freight trains have not operated on the Chicago line in at least 10 years. The only traffic most of these lines see is an occasional runner or bike rider, even though trespassing is usually forbidden.
The impetus for redevelopment has mostly come from neighbors rather than developers, because the vision is so grand and stretches across entire neighborhoods. ''It's hard for private development to be visionary unless it's a large-scale development where you can create a community,'' said Mr. Rogers, a former Chicago developer. ''Instead, you're responding to a small site and not a larger community.''
After years of grass-roots work, the Bloomingdale Trail is moving forward after Rahm Emanuel, who made completing the trail one of his campaign promises, was elected mayor in February. Over the next year, design concepts and engineering work will get under way. The Bloomingdale Trail will allow bikes and dogs, interconnect with new and existing ground-level parks and cost $40 million to $75 million.
In St. Louis, plans are in the works to renovate a 2.1-mile elevated rail trestle and turn it into a park as part of a larger waterfront revitalization project. The Iron Horse Trestle, estimated to cost $50 million, does not have a timeline. Organizers hope to have the first one-mile phase completed in five years.
''You have to be deliberate if you want this to last. It'll reflect St. Louis and be unique to it,'' said Susan Trautman, the executive director of Great Rivers Greenway District, a public group developing the Iron Horse Trestle.
Despite the High Line's visibility and help in showing donors and residents nationwide what is possible with an abandoned trestle, most cities realize they cannot mimic it. The park runs through Manhattan, the most densely populated area in the country, and attracted large sums of money from celebrities.
''The High Line is not easily replicable in other cities,'' said James Corner, principal of James Corner Field Operations, a New York architecture firm that designed the High Line with Diller Scofidio and Renfro. ''It's not just, 'Build a cool park and they will come.' It's, 'Build a cool park and connect it to a framework.' ''
Developers are hesitant to rely on these potential parks as they assemble new projects. In October, Mike and Matt Pestronk pounced on a 10-story office tower next to the Philadelphia viaduct when it fell into foreclosure and bought it for $5 million. The brothers, who had been watching the building for years and waiting for its price to drop, bought it because it was a good deal. The developers plan to renovate the vacant office tower for $25 million and turn it into apartments.
''The rents we project are that it doesn't happen,'' said Mike Pestronk, principal of Post Brothers Apartments in Philadelphia, referring to the viaduct project. ''If it does, it'll help us get higher rents.''
Still, the brothers are trying to improve the area and have done some ''guerrilla improvements'' to the viaduct, such as weeding and putting down plywood to cover holes, and installing artwork and live video projections on two sides of their building.
Plans for the viaduct are slowly moving ahead after nearly 10 years of grass-roots work. By the end of the year, the City Council is expected to approve a neighborhood improvement district that, among other things, would help oversee construction and fund-raising. As a first step, a small section of the trestle owned by a regional transportation authority would be redeveloped for $5.5 million.
''What we want to do is build the first phase, like New York, and have people say they love it and want to do the rest,'' said Paul R. Levy, the president of the Center City District. ''We do not need the Mercedes-Benz that they built in New York.''
The city is in talks with Reading International, a public company based in Commerce, Calif., that owns most of the viaduct.
James Corner's firm is riding his New York success to other cities, even if their projects only marginally resemble the High Line. In Seattle, an old elevated highway that runs along the waterfront and is at risk of collapse during an earthquake will be torn down and replaced with a series of parks, open areas and new transit. Traffic will be routed away from the area. Final designs and a cost estimate will be ready by the middle of next year.
''We weren't hiring them to come to Seattle to recreate the High Line,'' said Steve Pearce, the project manager of Waterfront Seattle, a civic partnership. Our effort is to create a new front porch for the city, a social mixing chamber.''
Atlanta also hired Mr. Corner to help redevelop a 22-mile rail corridor encircling the city. In the next 25 years, Atlanta plans to add 1,300 acres of parks and green spaces, public transit and trails along the necklace, increasing Atlanta green space by nearly 40 percent. The project's cost is put at $2.8 billion.
''The High Line is a park, and they made a conscious decision not to interact with private development,'' said Ethan Davidson, a spokesman for the Atlanta BeltLine, as the rail corridor is known. ''Atlanta is the kind of city where one project can transform a city. This very much knits the city together.''

HEADLINE: World Markets Staggered by Weak Consumer Data: Dow Slumps 2% on Sour Growth Outlook

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER; Graham Bowley contributed reporting.

 BODY:
As the debt limit drama ended in Washington, storm clouds thickened in the financial markets.
The broader United States stock market dropped 2.6 percent, erasing all of its gains for the year. That capped a string of declines over seven consecutive days, its longest losing streak since October 2008.
Fears of a sovereign default in either Italy or Spain re-emerged, and the interest rates on those countries' bonds soared. United States Treasury yields fell sharply to their lowest level in nearly a year as investors fled to the safety of American assets but also fretted over sclerotic economic growth. Gold, seen as another safe haven, leapt to a record high. 
European markets initiated the descent and the United States soon followed, despite Senate approval of an agreement to lift the debt ceiling and cut more than $2 trillion from federal spending.
The markets and the breaking of the budget impasse have been overwhelmed by bad economic news and the chances of more. On Tuesday, a report showed consumers cut spending the most in nearly two years. Attention turned to Friday's report on unemployment.
Market analysts and economists made clear that even though the debt limit agreement averted a potential default on United States debt, the drawn-out process had taken its toll.
''As the macro data comes out, it seems like we may have more on our hands than just getting the debt ceiling raised,'' said Myles Zyblock, chief institutional strategist and managing director of capital markets research at RBC Capital Markets.
''We get no default, but the bad news is there is a growth trade-off,'' he said. ''They had to agree on fiscal contraction that would weigh on growth.''
Stanley Nabi, the chief strategist for Silvercrest Asset Management Group, said he was starting to hear the word ''recession'' in questions from clients over the last few days.
Recent economic data is already weak, he said, noting the G.D.P. revisions on Friday that indicated the recession was deeper and the recovery more fragile than originally thought. On Tuesday, the Commerce Department said personal spending fell 0.2 percent in June, the first time it has declined since September 2009. And now that the debt ceiling deal has offered up the prospect of lower spending from the government, Mr. Nabi said, ''Who is going to drive the economy?''
''You can't rely on capital spending,'' he said. ''Trade is not strong enough to make that much of a difference. As far as the economy is concerned, what the data is showing is the economy has no momentum.''
Lawrence Creatura, portfolio manager at Federated Investors, said, ''The challenges that we are facing economically are that the hits just keep coming. We do have somewhat of a resolution to our budgetary impasse, but that does not overwhelm the fact that, economically speaking, that the data continues to deteriorate.''
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 32.89, or 2.56 percent, at 1,254.05, erasing all of the gains it had made this year. The Dow Jones industrial plummeted 265.87 points, or 2.19 percent, to 11,866.62, with a big dropoff toward the end of trading. And the Nasdaq index fell 75.37 points, or 2.75 percent, 2,669.24.
As the markets spiraled, analysts sifted through indexes, graphs and numbers, trying to balance risk and opportunity.
Stephen Wood, the chief markets strategist for Russell Investments, noted that the so-called fear index, or Vix, was ''bouncing around a lot.'' It was down at 24.67, below its high for the year, but also up from the last few weeks when it had hit the teens, even as low as 14.62 at the end of April.
''This is a risk-on, risk-off market,'' Mr. Wood said. ''You see waves of risk acceptance, then risk aversion.
''My take on it is volatility will be your constant travel companion,'' he said, listing the recent euro zone problems, the latest debt ceiling debates, talk of a United States credit downgrade and the potential for an economic slowdown ahead.
''A lot of these variables need to be priced in,'' he said.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury was at 2.61 percent, compared with 2.75 percent late on Monday. For the month of July, the note was down 37 basis points to 2.80 percent, compared with 3.17 percent in June.
Analysts said that the yields showed them that even as the instruments might have been in the line of fire of any government default, their price rose, suggesting economic growth concerns were overriding.
''The bond market has a very loud voice,'' Mr. Wood said. ''And the bond market is telling us that the bond market is more worried about the global economic slowdown than it is about downgrade or default.''
One of the largest looming economic indicators in the United States comes on Friday, when the Labor Department releases its national report on jobs, with estimates that the economy added 85,000 nonfarm payrolls in July, according to a Bloomberg News survey, compared with the 18,000 tacked on to payrolls in June.
Keith B. Hembre, the chief economist and chief investment strategist at First American Funds, said the behavior of the market on Tuesday is ''a bit different than the crisis feel.''
''It seems there is an asset allocation change going on oriented around lousy economic data recently, and perhaps there is some prepositioning to that and the expectation of numbers coming in well below the consensus,'' he said, referring to Friday's job report.
Still, one bright spot might be the corporate sector. Second-quarter earnings are on the verge of setting a record, and records are also expected for the remaining two quarters of this year, according to a recent survey by Howard Silverblatt, S.& P.'s index analyst.
But even that could be in flux.
Uri Landesman, the president of Platinum Partners, said that investors were discounting the news of the debt deal and, with such poor economic data, starting to question the viability of corporate earnings for the second half of the year.
''Economic data has been a disaster,'' he said. ''It's clunker after clunker.
''If the economy is desultory, how are the earnings going to excel?''

HEADLINE: Barclays Posts 38% Drop in Profit

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

 BODY:
9:12 p.m. Updated
Barclays, one of the largest banks in Britain, said on Tuesday that its profit dropped 38 percent in the first half of the year, weak results that underscored the financial firm's plan to cut costs and jobs.
Net income fell to 1.5 billion ($2.4 billion) in the first six months of 2011 from 2.4 billion in the period a year earlier. Barclays said it was hurt by high costs related to compensating customers who had received incorrect advice on payment insurance and by a decline in investment bank earnings. 
The earnings exceeded analysts' estimates, but the company's shares fell 0.12 percent in London.
''The numbers are not perfect but it could be a lot worse, with concerns around the European sovereign debt situation, banking regulation reviews and the general economic environment,'' said Richard Hunter, head of British equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers in London.
Barclays' chief executive, Robert E. Diamond Jr., pledged in February to review all businesses to find ways to reduce costs and improve profitability. Since then, the bank has decided to put its Russian retail operation up for sale and has been seeking to improve its loan books in Spain and Portugal.
''It's been a very difficult operating environment,'' Mr. Diamond said in a statement on Tuesday, adding that he expected the second half to provide the same challenges. He said he was ''pleased with the progress made across Barclays.''
Like many other banks, Barclays is also in the process of eliminating jobs, about 3,000 this year. Barclays cut 1,400 positions in the first half, and Mr. Diamond said he ''would expect the trend of the first half to continue and likely increase somewhat.''
His comments came after another large British bank, HSBC, announced on Monday that it planned to eliminate 30,000 jobs by the end of 2013. Credit Suisse said last week that it would eliminate 2,000 jobs.
Banks are looking to adjust to slower trading volume as some clients are nervous about government debt levels in Europe and the United States. At the same time, new financial regulations and higher capital requirements have also weighed on profitability.
Barclays said it had set aside 1.8 billion for bad loans and other credit risks in the first half, a decline of 41 percent from the period a year earlier. Return on equity, a measure of profitability, improved to 9.1 percent from 6.9 percent. Barclays has set itself a goal to reach a return on equity of 13 percent by 2013.
Barclays Capital reported pretax profit in the first half of 2.4 billion, a 9.3 percent drop from the period a year earlier, after demand for its credit, currency and commodities services and products declined. A drop in trading, especially in the second quarter, led income from bonds, currencies and commodities to fall 20 percent.
Mr. Diamond called on the British government and regulators to quickly end uncertainties about financial regulation. He reiterated that he was opposed to some proposals intended to shield retail businesses from investment banking operations, saying they could hurt the availability of credit.
Pretax profit at Barclays' retail banking operation fell to 446 million in the first half from 1.2 billion in the comparable period of 2010 after its operations on the Continent, especially in Spain, widened its pretax loss amid a deteriorating economic environment. It also set aside 1 billion to compensate customers who had mistakenly bought payment insurance.
Barclays said it expected its retail business in Western Europe to become profitable in the second half of the year. ''It's early days, and there's lots of work to do,'' Mr. Diamond said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Cubans Set for Big Change: Right to Buy Homes

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE; Victoria Burnett contributed reporting.

 BODY:
HAVANA -- Jose is an eager almost-entrepreneur with big plans for Cuban real estate. Right now he works illegally on trades, linking up families who want to swap homes and pay a little extra for an upgrade.
But when Cuba legalizes buying and selling by the end of the year -- as the government promised again this week -- Jose and many others expect a cascade of changes: higher prices, mass relocation, property taxes and a flood of money from Cubans in the United States and around the world.
''There's going to be huge demand,'' said Jose, 36, who declined to give his last name, stepping away from the crowd and keeping an eye out for eavesdroppers. ''It's been prohibited for so long.''
Private property is the nucleus of capitalism, of course, so the plan to legitimize it here in a country of slogans like ''socialism or death'' strikes many Cubans as jaw-dropping. Indeed, most people expect onerous regulations and already, the plan outlined by the state media would suppress the market by limiting Cubans to one home or apartment and requiring full-time residency. 
Yet even with some state control, experts say, property sales could transform Cuba more than any of the economic reforms announced by President Raul Castro's government, some of which were outlined in the National Assembly on Monday. Compared with the changes already passed (more self-employment and cell-phone ownership), or proposed (car sales and looser emigration rules), ''nothing is as big as this,'' said Philip Peters, an analyst with the Lexington Institute.
The opportunities for profits and loans would be far larger than what Cuba's small businesses offer, experts say, potentially creating the disparities of wealth that have accompanied property ownership in places like Eastern Europe and China.
Havana in particular may be in for a move back in time, to when it was a more stratified city. ''There will be a huge rearrangement,'' said Mario Coyula, Havana's director of urbanism and architecture in the 1970s and '80s. ''Gentrification will happen.''
Broader effects could follow. Sales would encourage much-needed renovation, creating jobs. Banking would expand because, under newly announced rules, payments would come from buyers' accounts. Meanwhile, the government, which owns all property now, would hand over homes and apartments to their occupants in exchange for taxes on sales -- impossible in the current swapping market where money passes under the table.
And then there is the role of Cuban emigrants. While the plan seems to prohibit foreign ownership, Cuban-Americans could take advantage of Obama administration rules letting them send as much money as they like to relatives on the island, fueling purchases and giving them a stake in Cuba's economic success. ''That is politically an extremely powerful development,'' Mr. Peters said, arguing that it could spur policy changes by both nations.
The rate of change, however, will likely depend on complications peculiar to Cuba. The so-called Pearl of the Antilles struggled with poor housing even before the 1959 Revolution, but deterioration, rigid rules and creative work-arounds have created today's warren of oddities.
There are no vacancies in Havana, Mr. Coyula pointed out. Every dwelling has someone living in it. Most Cubans are essentially stuck where they are.
On the waterfront of central Havana, children peek out from buildings that should be condemned, with a third of the facade missing.
Blocks inland, Cubans like Elena Acea, 40, have subdivided apartments to Alice in Wonderland proportions. Her two-bedroom is now a four-bedroom, with a plywood mezzanine where two stepsons live one atop the other, barely able to stand in their own rooms.
Like many Cubans, she hopes to move -- to trade her apartment for three smaller places so the elder son, 29, can start his own family. ''He's getting married,'' she said. ''He has to move out.''
But despite reassurances -- on Monday, Marino Murillo, a top official on economic policy, said selling would not need prior government approval -- Ms. Acea and many neighbors seemed wary of the government's promise to let go. Some Cubans expect rules forcing buyers to hold properties for five or 10 years. Others say the government will make it hard to take profits off the island, through exorbitant taxes or limits on currency exchange.
Still more, like Ernesto Benitez, 37, an artist, cannot imagine a real open market. ''They're going to set one price, per square foot, and that's it,'' he said.
Of course, he added, Cubans would respond by setting their own prices. And that might be enough to stimulate movement, he said.
He certainly hopes so. Mr. Benitez and the woman he has lived with for nearly a decade broke up 18 months ago. Each is now dating someone new and there are nights, they admit, that get a little awkward. Only a narrow bathroom separates their bedrooms.
Katia Gonzalez, 48, whose parents gave her their apartment before they died (which Cuba allows) said she would consider selling for a fair price. What did she think her two-bedroom just blocks from the ocean, in Havana's best neighborhood, could command? ''Oh, $25,000,'' she said. ''A little more, maybe $30,000.''
In Miami, a similar apartment might cost nearly 10 times that -- which is what many Cuban-Americans seem to be thinking. Jose and several other brokers in Havana said real estate transactions on the black market routinely involved money from Cubans overseas, especially Florida.
''There's always money coming in from Miami,'' said Gerardo, a broker who withheld his full name. ''The Cuban in Miami buys a house for his cousin in Cuba and when he comes here in the summer for a couple of months, he stays in that house.''
Technically, this is a violation of the trade embargo that began under President Dwight D. Eisenhower. According to the United States Treasury Department, deals or investments with Cubans are prohibited. Receiving money or profit from Cuba is also illegal.
But the rules are muddy in practice. Family transactions -- mainly involving recent emigrants -- seem to be expanding with a wink from the White House. Supporting private business is now encouraged under the general license that lets Cuban-Americans visit relatives, and in 2009, President Obama established a new policy letting Cuban-Americans visit the island whenever they want, and send unlimited remittances to relatives.
Beyond that, enforcement against individuals, as opposed to businesses, is practically nonexistent: in the past 18 months, only one American was penalized for violating the sanctions, with a fine of $525, according to a Congressional report published last month.
Experts say the Cuban diaspora has already begun to create a tiered social system in Cuba. Cuban emigrants sent back about $1 billion in remittances last year, studies show, with an increasing proportion of that money financing budding capitalists in need of pizza ovens or other equipment to work privately. Homes would simply expand the bond, experts say, and offers are already arriving.
Ilda, 69, lives alone in a five-bedroom, ninth-floor apartment with views of the sea. A visiting Cuban-American couple -- ''chic, very well dressed,'' she said -- asked to buy her apartment for $150,000, with little care for any bans on foreign ownership.
''I told them I can't,'' Ilda said. ''We're waiting for the law.'' Even when the law changes, she said she would prefer a ''permuta,'' a trade, because she would be guaranteed a place to live.
Her fear of having nowhere to go is common. One recent study, by Sergio Diaz-Briquets, a Washington-based demography expert, found that Cuba has a housing deficit of 1.6 million units. The government says the number is closer to 500,000, still a serious problem.
Mr. Coyula said money from sales might not be enough to fix it, since there is almost no construction industry, permitting process or materials to build with.
Other thorny issues might have to be revisited. ''Evictions haven't happened here since 1939,'' he said. ''There's a law forbidding them.''
For now, though, Cubans are trying to grasp basic details. How will the mortgage system work? How high will taxes be? What's a fair price?
There is even a question of how buyers and sellers will come together. Classified listings are illegal in Cuba, which explains why brokers like Jose, known as corredores, spend their days moving through open air bazaars with notebooks listing apartments offered or desired.
He already has two employees working for him and when the new law arrives, whether his services are legal or not, he expects to hire more. ''We have to get coordinated,'' he said. ''It's coming.''

Once the purchase and sale of property is allowed in Cuba, places like Havana, above, may become more class-conscious.
 Housing is so scarce that many homes, like this one, have been divided to hold more families. (A3)

HEADLINE: AAA Rating Is a Rarity In Business

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Hanging over the debt ceiling negotiations in Washington has been the threat that the United States could lose its AAA credit rating, a coveted measure of the federal government's financial strength. But in corporate America, the top rating long ago became an anachronism.
Scores of big corporations have lost their AAA status in recent years -- only four non-financial companies continue to hold the rating -- as it became seen in board rooms as more of a straitjacket than a path to riches. Just as many consumers relied on their credit cards to finance a higher standard of living, companies took on more debt to reap bigger returns.
The choice did not appear to hurt them. The borrowing costs of companies with AAA ratings and those one level below are not that far apart. Investors, in other words, do not see much difference in quality.
''It's like you are going from a Rolls-Royce to a Mercedes -- not from a Rolls-Royce to a Yugo,'' said Chris Orndorff, a senior portfolio manager for the bond giant Western Asset Management. ''That's nothing to be ashamed of.'' 
More and more, in fact, companies have found that a AAA credit rating is not something worth aspiring to if a more conservative approach means lower profits.
Today, markets often render credit judgments before the rating agencies can take out their pens, so a downgrade has a less noticeable effect. By that time, many of the traditional benefits of being deemed AAA, like lower borrowing costs and reputational glow, have evaporated.
In the early 1980s, around 60 companies had AAA credit. By 2000, the number of AAA companies was about 15. Today just four corporations-- Automatic Data Processing, Exxon Mobil, Johnson & Johnson and Microsoft -- can claim those once-coveted three initials. (Five big insurers and several government affiliated organizations can too.)
Analysts say corporate buyouts and acquisitions accelerated the trend. Many AAA companies lost their ratings when they were taken over and their new owners loaded them with cheap debt to help pay for the deal. Other strategic decisions also triggered downgrades.
UPS, for example, struck a long-term agreement with its union workers in fall 2007 that raised pay and benefits but froze certain pension obligations. Soon after, the ratings agencies started knocking down the company's credit rating to AA because of the new pension arrangement.
''Maintaining a AAA rating is not a financial goal of this company,'' a UPS spokesman said at the time. Investors barely reacted. In the three months after the downgrade, yields on UPS bonds responded by increasing about 0.4 percentage point from 5.32 percent. Today, with borrowers enjoying ultra-low interest rates, the bond yields are back to their levels in late 2007.
Meanwhile, the financial crisis and deep recession laid into several of the sturdiest pillars of American capitalism. Berkshire Hathaway, General Electric and Pfizer all lost their AAA ratings.
Still, a funny thing happened when these companies were sent down to AA. Investors shrugged off the change; the markets had already rendered their verdict. Borrowing costs for General Electric and Berkshire actually fell in the weeks after they were downgraded in spring 2009, amid a broader market rally.
''The rating agencies were late to the party,'' said Mr. Orndorff, the bond investor.
Ratings for companies and countries are viewed differently, even if they are evaluated in much the same way.
For most Americans, the prospect that the government could lose its AAA credit rating is almost unthinkable -- a blow to national pride and consumer confidence that could turn out to be more damaging than any increase in borrowing costs.
That is why even after President Obama signed a law on Tuesday that lifted the debt ceiling, some in Washington were worried that the plan's spending cuts were not deep enough to appease all the major rating agencies.
For now, all three major rating firms continue to give the United States a AAA rating. But on Tuesday, Moody's said its outlook was negative after putting the government on notice last month that it could be downgraded. Fitch said on Tuesday that it planned to complete another review of the government's finances by the end of this month, and Standard & Poor's has warned that the United States might lose its rating if it did not sharply rein in the deficit.
It helps, of course, that the dollar remains the world's leading currency, ensuring that demand for United States debt is strong in spite of the nation's myriad financial challenges.
But the truth is, even as the government maintained its AAA grade, the markets suggested long ago that the United States was no longer deserving of such a high rating.
The credit-default swap market provided one clue. During the financial crisis in early 2009, the price of insurance that would pay off if the United States government defaulted on its debt was similar to that offered for companies ranked just above junk. Even today, the price of insurance on a government default has been higher than that for Colgate Palmolive, the global toothpaste giant, which has a rating two notches below AAA.
The economic data also suggests that the United States has higher debt levels than most AAA corporate borrowers. Today, the United States debt as a percentage of the nation's economic output is 75 percent and could top 84 percent by 2013, according to Standard & Poor's research. The typical AAA-rated country has a ratio of about 11.4 percent.
By contrast, Exxon Mobil and Microsoft each had debt-to-income ratios exceeding 20 percent, while Automatic Data Processing had a ratio of 1.8 percent, according to Capital IQ, a business owned by Standard & Poor's. Johnson & Johnson had a ratio of 92 percent.
But unlike Washington, there is no threat to the AAA credit rating of Johnson & Johnson. That Johnson, the 125-year-old maker of Tylenol and Listerine, could have a better rating than the country in which it resides would be unusual but not a first
Toyota retained its AAA rating for several years after a sluggish economy led the rating agencies to start downgrading Japanese government debt in 1998.
Today, a handful of European corporations, like Portugal Telecom or Helecom of Greece, have received higher ratings than their fiscally troubled homelands. That is because a big portion of their revenue comes from foreign customers. In the last few weeks, the ratings agencies have made it clear that lowering the AAA rating of the United States government was unlikely to cause any AAA-rated American company to lose its rating-- at least in the coming months.
But longer-term, top-flight ratings for American companies could be jeopardized if the government's effort to get its own finances under control caused a slowdown in economic growth.
''What agreement there is on the deficit, and what spending is going to be or not be, will have an impact,'' said John J. Bilardello, the head of corporate ratings at Standard & Poor's.
A downgrade of a country rating can ripple through other entities that rely on the government for support, potentially raising borrowing costs across the economy. These include mortgage bonds issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as debt sold by dozens of states and counties whose local economies have strong ties to Washington. It also could affect about a dozen insurance companies and too-big-to-fail banks, whose ratings benefit from the perception that the government would bail them out if they ran into trouble again.
But could an American company's credit really be more solid than the full faith and credit of the United States? The ratings agencies may say so one day, but lawmakers and citizens might have a reaction like that of Warren E. Buffett, after his Berkshire Hathaway lost its prized AAA status in 2009.
''We're still AAA in my mind,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Islanders' Future Blurred By Rejection of Plan To Pay for a New Arena

BYLINE: By JEFF Z. KLEIN and KEN BELSON

 BODY:
Charles Wang, the owner of the Islanders, said last week there was ''no Plan B'' if Nassau County, N.Y., voters rejected a plan to borrow $400 million to pay for a new arena for his team, a minor league ballpark and new convention space.
He might have to find a Plan B now that the measure was voted down, 57 percent to 43, on Monday. 
''Right now, I have to tell you, it's a very emotional time and we're not going to make any comments on any specific next steps,'' Wang said Tuesday at the county-owned Coliseum, which was built in 1972 and contains few of the luxury boxes and amenities that produce significant revenue for the N.H.L.'s other 29 clubs.
The club has promised to remain at the Coliseum in Uniondale until its current lease expires in 2015. The bond issue defeated Monday was just the latest version of a plan to fix the arena. Wang had proposed an earlier real estate project, which included refurbishing the Coliseum, that fell through last year.
But if a plan to renovate or replace the Coliseum does not succeed between now and 2015, will the Islanders move, and if so, where?
The front-runners at this very early stage are Brooklyn and Quebec City, with Kansas City, Mo.; Hamilton, Ontario; and Seattle regarded as much longer shots.
Wang, a part or full owner of the Islanders since 2000, has left open the option of moving the club, which loses an estimated $20 million per season, after the 2014-15 season.
County Executive Edward P. Mangano, who backed the arena deal, said Tuesday that he was seeking proposals for developing the 77-acre Coliseum site.
''The time is now to explore a new path for economic development opportunities and job growth at the site of Nassau Coliseum,'' Mangano said. ''I encourage all those with a plan to contact the county immediately.''
N.H.L. Commissioner Gary Bettman, who has made several public appearances in support of Wang's Coliseum-related projects, reiterated his support on Tuesday.
''We will continue to work closely with the Islanders to explore whatever options still may be available in light of what obviously is not a positive development,'' Bettman said. ''Our goal is for the team to remain on Long Island and we still hope that objective can be realized.''
The Brooklyn option involves the Nets' new basketball arena, the Barclays Center, that is scheduled to open in September 2012. A revised design of the arena has raised doubts over whether the arena floor, in its present configuration, is large enough to accommodate an N.H.L.-sized ice sheet. But Brett Yormark, the chief executive of the Barclays Center, said the arena ''will have an ice rink that can support professional hockey.''
While the N.H.L. and the operators of the arena have not had talks about bringing the Islanders to Brooklyn, Yormark made it clear that hockey is an option in his arena.
''Due to the venue's design, the capacity for hockey would be several thousand seats less than for basketball,'' he said. ''While we hope to explore hockey opportunities in the future, our primary focus at the moment is to build the best sports and entertainment venue in the world.''
Moving the team 26 miles from Uniondale to Brooklyn would keep much of the Islanders' fan base intact and would help preserve the club's legacy of four straight Stanley Cups in the early 1980s and 19 straight playoff series victories.
It would also provide Wang or whoever owns the Islanders with luxury-box revenue, and more access to public transportation than the Coliseum has.
But a relocation of the Islanders to Brooklyn would do little to solve an underlying problem -- the presence of three N.H.L. teams in the New York area, where hockey is not an overriding passion. Nor will it solve the Islanders' 18-year drought without winning a playoff series, which has led to low attendance and a lack of coverage in the sports media.
''When you have nine professional teams and three in one sport, it can present problems,'' Bettman said in 1995, when the Devils threatened to move to Nashville.
Bettman was quick to add that the glut of teams does not necessarily mean an N.H.L. club has to move from the New York area. But what he said about the Devils in 1995 remains applicable to the Islanders today.
In Quebec, however, hockey is king, and there they are in the middle of a big push to bring back the N.H.L. The Nordiques left there in 1995.
With the Canadian dollar strong, plans are proceeding for the construction of a new $400 million rink, financed by a mix of provincial, municipal and private funds to be completed by fall 2015.
Mayor Regis Lebeaume said last week that he was ''watching the referendum on Long Island.''
Quebec City is probably first in line to get a relocated N.H.L. team, but right now it seems most likely that the Phoenix Coyotes, not the Islanders, will be that team.
The Coyotes, operated as a money-losing proposition by the N.H.L. and still seeking a buyer two years after its previous owner put the team into bankruptcy, are guaranteed to stay at their Glendale, Ariz., arena only through the 2011-12 season.
If Brooklyn or Quebec City are not available, the Islanders may look to Kansas City, where the four-year-old Sprint Center is still seeking an anchor tenant and where the Islanders staged an exhibition game in 2009.
But there has been little public groundswell in support of bringing the N.H.L. to Kansas City, despite the city being proposed as a destination in recent years when the Pittsburgh Penguins and Nashville Predators threatened to move.
Hamilton's problem is that it is too close to Toronto and Buffalo. Neither the Leafs nor the Sabres have indicated they would welcome a new team in their territory.
Last spring Bill Daly, the N.H.L.'s deputy commissioner, confirmed that the league had been approached by a Seattle group about acquiring a club.
Seattle has a long history in hockey -- in 1917 it became the first American city to win the Stanley Cup -- and has supported a team in the junior Western Hockey League since the 1977-78 season.

HEADLINE: Fiscal Worries Fueled Defeat Of Arena Plan

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER; Adriane Quinlan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Like voters everywhere, the people of Nassau County had watched helplessly as Congress and the White House played poker over the nation's debt limit, with a potential fiscal and economic catastrophe hanging in the balance.
Then, on Monday, they were given an opportunity to lash out, close to home, over something more comprehensible but not entirely dissimilar: the suggestion that their debt-ridden, overtaxed county should borrow and tax hundreds of millions of dollars more for a new arena for the once-proud New York Islanders hockey team.
By a wide margin, they said no.
The spectacular defeat for the Islanders' owner, Charles B. Wang, and his allies in county government was caused by an unlikely but broad coalition: Tea Party members and Democratic leaders, elderly residents already worried about the fate of Social Security and Medicare, parents of young children and powerful real estate developers. 
It also raised the prospect that Long Island's only major sports team -- the winner of four Stanley Cups in the 1980s -- might pick up and move in 2015, when its lease at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum expires.
In interviews on Tuesday across a dense slice of suburbia stretching from the 40-year-old coliseum in Uniondale to the county government complex in Mineola, voters still rattled by the federal showdown over the debt limit said they opposed the plan for a new arena. They explained that they were less concerned about the future of a faded hockey franchise than about paying their monthly bills.
''I can't afford a ticket to go to the Islanders,'' said Alessandra de Bellegarde, 54, of Manhasset, a special education teacher. ''I'm constantly watching so I don't go over my budget. I wish politicians would do the same. Why are they saying they want this deal when people are cutting back on food and losing jobs?''
At the Stop & Shop in Carle Place, Pat Marinacci, 68, a retired postal clerk, said property taxes in the county were already high enough. ''I can't imagine what made them think homeowners were going to pay for it,'' she said.
''The last thing we need is a new stadium,'' she added. ''It disregards the entire economic state of the union. It's like, are we on the same planet?''
Others called the proposal a giveaway that the county, whose finances were taken over by a state control board in January, could ill afford.
''I think the people that are interested in the stadium should be able to pay for it,'' said Joseph Gordon, 89, a retired business owner, as he shopped at a supermarket in Carle Place. ''It's a scam.''
The arena plan -- supported by Mr. Wang and the Nassau County executive, Edward P. Mangano -- went not just against public opinion, but also against the tide in stadium construction, which has heavily favored private financing ever since a wave of publicly financed ballparks and arenas failed to generate the promised economic benefits. The San Diego Chargers football team has struggled even to get a ballot measure for a new stadium, and the suburb of Glendale, Ariz., faces lawsuits for trying to bail out the bankrupt Coyotes hockey team in exchange for the team's dropping Phoenix from its name.
Mr. Wang and Mr. Mangano had promised that a new arena, and an adjacent minor-league ballpark thrown in as a sweetener, would create new jobs and local revenues. But with the Islanders' attendance the worst in the N.H.L. last season, they were unable to guarantee it. Rather than raising the $400 million price tag through a revenue bond paid off with incremental sales taxes and concession receipts, they proposed a general-obligation bond, which would be paid off with increased property taxes on county residents for the next 30 years.
Bernie Lowsky, 72, a retired business owner, said he voted for the bond issue because he thought it would stimulate the economy and create jobs. But he confessed to another motive: He wanted a reason to buy season tickets again. ''I was a big-time fan years ago, but now that they're awful, I go considerably less,'' he said.
In hindsight, for Mr. Mangano, a Republican, the referendum campaign looked like a triple dose of political hemlock.
First, he alienated the public workers' unions, which would be a vital constituency in a re-election campaign, by spending $2.2 million on the ballot measure after laying off 128 county workers on July 1. ''Services should come before sports,'' said Jerry Laricchiuta, president of the Nassau civil servants' union, the second-largest in New York State.
Then Mr. Mangano outraged Tea Party groups, whose antitax fervor had secured his narrow and surprising victory over a Democratic incumbent in 2008. That incumbent had proposed an even bigger plan for a new Islanders arena, which would have been paid for by the team, not the public.
And Mr. Mangano also infuriated the island's wealthy and politically connected roster of real estate developers, each of whom wanted a fair chance at building on the coliseum site.
''It's probably the most expensive piece of property on Long Island,'' said Desmond Ryan, executive director of the Association for a Better Long Island, the developers' lobby. ''It's the crown jewel. And to sole-source that property to an individual just because he owned a hockey team made no sense.''
Mr. Ryan's group ran advertisements opposing the plan in weekly newspapers and on the radio. Tea Party members handed out leaflets at train stations. Meanwhile, Mr. Wang, in what some said was a tactical error, bought advertisements on television and in Newsday, appealing to his core supporters but also giving the issue wider exposure.
The proponents of the stadium plan also did not count on the debt-limit showdown in Washington, which appeared to have heightened voters' sensitivity to concerns about borrowing capacity, spending and fiscal responsibility.
Mr. Ryan said that when he heard President Obama warn that retirees' Social Security checks could be endangered if Congress did not vote to raise the debt limit, ''I was sitting in my living room with my wife, saying, 'I could kiss that guy right now.' ''
The result was a voter turnout of 17 percent -- five times what proponents had expected for a Monday in August -- and a rejection of the stadium plan, 57 percent to 43 percent.
By late Tuesday, Mr. Mangano's aides were privately playing down the failure of the proposal, suggesting that Mr. Mangano's goal all along was to be able to say he had done all he could to keep the Islanders in Nassau. Now, if they leave, voters will have only themselves to blame.
Publicly, however, Mr. Mangano was offering to field proposals from any developer interested in a new plan for the coliseum site, with or without a hockey team.

HEADLINE: Spending Fell and Income Barely Rose in June

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Americans cut back on spending in June for the first time in nearly two years, and their incomes grew by the smallest amount in nine months, troubling signs in a barely growing economy. 
The Commerce Department said in a report released on Tuesday that consumer spending dropped 0.2 percent in June. Some of the decline was caused by declining food and energy prices, which had spiked in recent months. When excluding those items, consumer spending was flat.
Income rose 0.1 percent, the weakest showing since September, reflecting anemic hiring this spring, while the personal savings rate rose to 5.4 percent of after-tax incomes, the highest level since August 2010.
The data highlighted that consumer spending weakened during the April-June quarter, which could mean the sluggish economy is worsening. Consumer spending is closely watched because it accounts for 70 percent of domestic economic activity.
''The recent run of weak economic news has made us more concerned that any rebound will be more modest than previously looked likely,'' said Paul Dales, senior United States economist at Capital Economics.
High gas prices and unemployment have squeezed household budgets this spring, leading to tepid overall economic growth in the April-June quarter. The economy expanded at an annual rate of 1.3 percent in the second quarter after only 0.4 percent growth in the first three months of the year. The combined growth for the first six months was the worst since the recession ended two years ago.
Many Americans are cutting back on purchases of cars, furniture, appliances and electronics. Employers have responded by reducing hiring. The economy added just 18,000 net jobs in June, the fewest in nine months. The unemployment rate rose to 9.2 percent, the highest level this year.
The government is to issue its employment report for July on Friday.
The biggest drop in spending occurred in items like food and gasoline. Spending on such non-durable goods fell 5.5 percent, reflecting price declines after increases early this year. An inflation gauge tied to consumer spending dropped 0.2 percent in June, the biggest one-month decline since September 2009. Outside of food and energy, prices were up 0.1 percent.
Still, spending on durable goods, such as autos, also fell in June 1.1 percent. One reason for the decline may be the shortage of popular car models in showrooms. Supply chain disruptions caused by the March earthquake in Japan have limited production of auto and electronic parts.
Declining growth and rising unemployment have raised concerns that the country could fall back into a recession.
Many analysts were still hopeful that growth will rebound in the second half of the year, but the timing of any turnaround is hard to gauge. Manufacturers had their weakest growth in two years in July, according to the Institute for Supply Management.
And gasoline prices remain high, even after coming down from a peak of nearly $4 a gallon in early May. The average price for a gallon of regular unleaded was $3.70 on Tuesday -- 14 cents higher than a month ago and almost a dollar more than in the same month last year.
Some economists have begun to trim their forecasts for the second half of the year. Capital Economics said it had cut its outlook for second-half growth to 2 percent from a previous forecast of 2.5 percent.

HEADLINE: Apollo Group to Buy Maker of Math Courses

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL

 BODY:
Hoping to keep more of its students from dropping out, the Apollo Group, which operates the profit-making University of Phoenix, said Tuesday that it would pay $75 million to buy Carnegie Learning, which offers computer-based math instruction. 
Carnegie Learning, based in Pittsburgh, was founded in 1998 by scientists from Carnegie Mellon University who developed an approach to teaching math that combines classroom work with computer instruction. Its Cognitive Tutor software analyzes students' weaknesses as they work through problems and offers new problems until they are ready to move on.
''Math is a subject where we see a lot of students having difficulty'' at the college level, said Gregory W. Cappelli, Apollo's co-chief executive. ''We think by adding the Carnegie Learning solution into our platform, we'll really help our students to have better outcomes in math.''
Carnegie Learning is one of a number of small- to medium-size companies that offer instructional material for use on computers and tablets and data analysis for schools, a market that has piqued investors' interest in the past year. It says its curricula is used by 600,000 students in grades 6 through 12, in 3,000 schools nationwide.
Dennis Ciccone, Carnegie Learning's chief executive, said sales had increased 20 to 30 percent annually since 2005, although they have slowed this year with the economy. Apollo plans to adapt the Carnegie Learning software for other academic subjects and use it both in traditional classrooms and with online students.
Profit-making colleges like the University of Phoenix have been the focus of government scrutiny in recent years, accused of aggressively recruiting students, especially online students, but saddling them with unmanageable debt and few marketable skills. In June the Education Department tightened regulations, though not as strictly as industry critics had advocated.
Although enrollment at the 400,000-student University of Phoenix has fallen sharply, Apollo's stock hit a 52-week high last month after the release of quarterly results in June that exceeded analysts' estimates.

HEADLINE: Farm to Table, Literally

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
When it comes to produce, there is local, there is hyperlocal, and then there is the Riverpark Farm at Alexandria Center.
This rather formal designation is the name of a two-week-old farm that has found a temporary home in a stalled Manhattan construction site bounded by plywood. It is less than 100 feet from the kitchen of Tom Colicchio's Riverpark restaurant on East 29th Street near the East River, and it is supplying produce for that 245-seat restaurant, as well as a 175-seat 'Wichcraft next door. 
'' 'Farm to table' now means something very different - we are literally bringing the farm to the table,'' said Mr. Colicchio, who added, ''I'm actually shocked at how much is growing.''
That's because the farm has an area of 15,000 square feet, as large as the vast new hydroponic rooftop garden in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, Gotham Greens.
Riverpark Farm is weeded, watered, tended, harvested and replanted by two full-time farmers, with the assistance of chefs from the kitchen, who can be observed sauntering through the garden, clipping herbs at dinnertime. ''This week we're taking out 50 pounds of cucumbers a day,'' said Sisha Ortuzar, Riverpark's executive chef and a partner, ''and last week it was zucchini and squash.'' The menu is changed daily to reflect the harvest.
The garden is situated in the vacant footprint of the West tower of the Alexandria real estate project, one of hundreds of construction sites stalled by the recession whose permitting status has been legally ''frozen'' by the city, enabling them to resume construction without obtaining fresh permits when the economy turns around.
Since the farm will ultimately have to be moved, the vegetables are planted in milk crates filled with soil. The planters, 3,400 of them, were seeded and germinated at a farm in New Paltz, N.Y., then trucked down to the city and installed at 5 a.m. several weeks ago.
Currently there are 6,000 plants in 85 crops, including 10 kinds of tomatoes (beefsteak, plum, cherry and seven heirloom varieties); 12 kinds of peppers, from sweet to spicy; five varieties of eggplant; and 30 herbs. ''We're also planting crops that are hard to find at the Greenmarket, like bronze fennel, red amaranth and ruby-streak mustard greens,'' Mr. Ortuzar said.
Jeffrey Zurofsky, Riverpark's managing partner, said, ''We wanted to put in a beehive, but the bees have already found us - the garden is covered in local bees.''
Mr. Ortuzar added, ''The only ones enjoying this more than the bees is the kitchen staff - because we can work with it all.''
But in September, the bees must learn to share. Part of the black-and-white plywood will be removed to permit Riverpark customers to dine in the garden at a 12-seat farmer's table. ''They'll be able to dine among their produce,'' he said, ''right in the garden.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: On Boards, Little Cause For Anxiety

BYLINE: By STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF. 
Steven M. Davidoff, a former corporate lawyer at Shearman & Sterling, is a professor at the University of Connecticut School of Law. His columns can be found at nytimes.com/dealbook. Follow @StevenDavidoff on Twitter.

 BODY:
Do the former directors of the institutions that collapsed during the financial crisis have anything to worry about? If the experience of Enron is any example, the answer is a resounding no.
A look back at the career paths of onetime Enron directors indicates that the former directors of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers will continue their prominent careers.
Enron collapsed into bankruptcy in 2001 amid accusations of accounting improprieties and outright fraud. The scandal sent shock waves through corporate America, but compared with the global financial crisis, it almost seems small and quaint. 
Still, in the case of Enron, unlike in the financial crisis, top corporate executives went to prison. Most prominently, Jeffrey Skilling, a former chief executive of Enron, was sentenced to 24 years in prison.
Yet while some Enron executives paid a price for the scandal, it is a different story with Enron's former directors - the people charged with overseeing the company. A search of their current whereabouts shows that they have recovered nicely from the scandal.
Four former Enron directors still serve on public boards. Frank Savage, for example, still heads his own investment firm and serves on the boards of Bloomberg L.P. and Lockheed Martin. Norman P. Blake Jr. serves on the board of Owens Corning, where he is the head of that company's audit committee.
A number have gone back to or entered academia. Wendy Gramm, the wife of the former senator Phil Gramm, vice chairman of UBS investment bank, is still in residence at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University.
Robert K. Jaedicke, who was chairman of Enron's audit committee, teaches at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business. And Lord John Wakeham has remained chancellor of Brunel University in London.
The private sector Enron directors also continued their careers without much of a hiccup. Ken L. Harrison retired as chief executive of the Portland General Electric Company in 2000. And Ronnie C. Chan has remained chairman of the Hang Lung Group in Hong Kong since Enron's collapse.
Most of the remaining directors have since retired or now work in small private or family businesses, a euphemism for semiretirement.
John Mendelsohn, for example, is to retire next month as head of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.
Then there is Rebecca Mark-Jusbasche. She was named one of the ''luckiest persons in Houston'' by Fortune magazine. Ms. Mark-Jusbasche left the Enron board in 2000, selling more than $80 million worth of company stock. She now runs family properties in New Mexico and Colorado.
A few of the directors conveniently omit Enron from their biographies, but they do not appear to remain tainted, staying in their chosen professions.
The only court penalty placed upon them was related to a $165 million settlement of shareholder litigation arising from Enron's demise. The directors personally had to pay a relatively large $13 million. The rest was covered by insurance.
The experiences of the Enron directors over the last decade would appear to offer great hope to the directors of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers.
Indeed, many of these directors remain not only as directors of public companies from before the financial crisis, but they have joined new boards. Even Alan Greenberg is still on the Viacom board with a fellow Bear board alumnus, Frederic V. Salerno, who serves on six public company boards. In all, 6 of the 12 Bear directors at the time of the investment bank's collapse are still directors of public companies.
None of the Bear directors have appeared to have career difficulties. The two academics on the board were the Rev. Donald J. Harrington, who remains the president of St. John's University, and Henry S. Bienen, who is emeritus president of Northwestern University. Frank T. Nickell is still chief executive, president and chairman of Kelso & Company, while Paul A. Novelly remains C.E.O. of the Apex Oil Company.
In fact, with the exception of James E. Cayne, none are fully retired or appear to be having trouble finding good positions.
It is the same for Lehman Brothers, with Richard S. Fuld Jr., the former chief executive, bearing the brunt of the public approbation. He is at his own firm, Matrix Advisors, and - fairly or unfairly - remains the focus of blame for Lehman's demise.
As for the other Lehman directors, six of them held directorships as recently as January. Jerry A. Grundhofer was appointed to the Citigroup board after Lehman's fall. He has since resigned from that board, but he remains on the boards of EcoLab and the Midland Company. Roland A. Hernandez joined the Sony board and still remains on the boards of MGM Mirage, the Ryland Group and Vail Resorts.
The rest of the board members were mostly private investors. Roger S. Berlind was and still is a theatrical producer. Michael L. Ainslie, former chief executive of Sotheby's, is a private investor. Christopher Gent is a senior adviser to the consulting group Bain & Company as well as nonexecutive chairman of GlaxoSmithKline.
So the Bear and Lehman directors are returning to public company service even quicker than the Enron directors. In part this reflects the old boy network on Wall Street, which keeps people in the same positions because of friendships. It is not a coincidence that two former Bear Stearns directors serve on the Viacom board.
The trend also underscores the decline in the importance of reputation on Wall Street - even since the time of Enron. Prior bad conduct simply is often not viewed as a problem.
But in the case of the Bear and Lehman directors there is another significant factor. The financial crisis was an enormously complex event, and people will be debating its causes for years to come. Blame can be dispersed, and an executive or director can simply say it was the crisis itself - not poor management or inadequate board supervision - that caused their firm's demise.
I am not arguing that these directors be tarred and feathered or that they should not be able to earn a living, but rather that there should be market penalties for failure - just as Ms. Gramm's Mercatus Center often argues. At a minimum, one would think that other public companies might be more hesitant to keep these failed directors on their boards.
In the end, the directors of companies that failed in the financial crisis will most likely receive an even freer pass than the Enron directors.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.
Correction: August 5, 2011, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Deal Professor column on Wednesday, about the career paths of Enron directors after the energy company collapsed in 2001, misstated the year that one former director, Ken L. Harrison, retired as chief executive of the Portland General Electric Company. It was 2000, not last year.

HEADLINE: Arriving at a Deal, and Reality, Through the Maze of Capitol Hill

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
An alternate reality takes hold once you enter the United States Capitol, a reality with little connection to the everyday life unfolding beyond the boundaries of its fortresslike grandeur. Your sense of direction is thrown off, along with any sense of time or understanding of basic human interaction.
No necktie needed here, but it is required there. That 1 o'clock news conference is now 3 o'clock, or maybe never. To reach the third level from the first, walk down, not up. And here comes Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, engulfed by journalists hoping to record a word of truth, while an aide calls out: ''Be nice, everybody! Be nice! Be nice!''
This unreality seemed keenest in the hours leading up to Monday evening's vote in the House of Representatives for a contentious deficit-reduction deal that will prevent a government default -- a heart-stopping possibility created by some of those who stride these marbled halls, breathing its alternate air. In this hermetically sealed world, tensions were high, faces were set in the rictus of insincere smiles, and everyone was claiming to speak for that complicated constituency known as ''the American people.'' 
Then, quietly, a slight woman walked onto the floor of the House, dressed in a teal jacket, dark pants and running shoes. Carefully she came, one step at a time, as though not wanting to disturb the proceedings. But this surprise appearance by the Arizona congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, her first since being shot in the head by a gunman in Tucson seven months ago, changed the atmosphere.
In came the fresh-air reality of duty to country, and a reminder to all: Do better.
Throughout the day, an interloper in the halls of Congress on Monday struggled to find his bearings, though possibly because there were no bearings to be had. Everything seemed -- uncertain.
You could sense the irritated weariness from the months of squabbling over the country's ballooning deficit, exacerbated by the refusal of some Tea Party Republicans to allow another rise in the debt ceiling, which had become de rigueur in recent decades. The supposed moment when the United States would be unable to pay its bills, a would-be international calamity, was drawing closer by the hour, though a bloody compromise seemed near at hand.
The deal would allow for increases in the debt ceiling past next year's elections and, over all, alter the way the country spends. Gone would be the days of heavy spending on economic stimulus and the military, to be replaced by austere cuts to trim annual deficits approaching a trillion dollars. It was a grin-and-bear-it compromise, though many Republicans allowed themselves slight smiles for winning as much as they did through games of brinkmanship with the Democrat-controlled White House and Senate.
Still, the Republicans first had to secure the votes in the House before the measure could move on to the Senate -- which would overwhelmingly approve it on Tuesday -- and, ultimately, to the White House, to be signed by President Obama. That meant that the Escher-like warrens of the Capitol became the setting for a daylong game of peek-a-boo between reporters and elected officials. Turn here, and run into a gaggle of tourists in shorts and T-shirts; turn there, and suffer the stony gaze of a row of vice-presidential busts; turn another way, and come upon dozens of reporters, waiting, waiting.
Rumors that Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. might have a thing to say created a clot of reporters in one blue-carpeted hallway. Suddenly, from behind, there came the diminutive Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, simply trying to get from Point A to Point B. ''Is it possible?'' he asked. ''I want to get through.''
The media sea parted, the representative passed, and an aide used the moment to give instructions of decorum. ''Everybody, take four steps that way, please,'' she told journalists. ''That's wonderful. That's so much better.''
Then someone said ''Oh, Mr. Vice President,'' even though there was no vice president present, and everyone laughed, without mirth. Meanwhile, around the corner, a lectern and a backdrop of five American flags had been set up, almost as bait for a passing politician. Eight cameras and a dozen reporters waited for a bite.
At 3:30, a group of Republican leaders from the House, led by Speaker John A. Boehner, stepped up to another lectern, in another Capitol cubbyhole, to promote the debt-ceiling deal as imperfect but sea-changing. But Mr. Boehner left the stage without answering the shouted question of whether he had enough votes for passage, while a nearby television monitor announced that the great American sideshow, Donald Trump, considered the deal ''a joke.''
A few minutes later, representatives of the Congressional Progressive Caucus appeared at the Boehner-warm lectern to deplore the plan as an assault on working families and the result of a hostage situation created by Tea Party Republicans. But fewer reporters remained to listen.
With the evening vote less than two hours away, reporters and elected officials bantered in the Speaker's Lobby, where jackets and ties are required for men and a primer in the esoteric language of nuts-and-bolts government would be required for most Americans. Then some representatives gathered on the floor of the House to engage in perfunctory, time-killing debate, where Democrats and Republicans yielded time to one another so their squabbling would have a cordial veneer.
In the gallery above, blocks of colorfully dressed tourists sat down, listened, and left en masse; on the floor below, a few Republicans joked among themselves during a speech by the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi.
Shortly before 7, hundreds of House members began filing in to vote on the historic measure before them; passage looked good, but aides to the Republican leadership were still working the floor, pressing the uncommitted. As time passed, many members looked up to the wall behind the press gallery, where votes were being recorded beside names. A bright green Y for yes; a bright red N for no.
With 8:38 left to voting, there were 157 yes votes and 98 no -- with 216 needed for passage. Men and women gazed up as if calmly watching fireworks, although they knew that defeat of the proposal would upset the world.
With 2:20 left, the count was 182 to 108. And then, from one corner of the chamber, there came applause and shouts of joy that grew louder by the second, decorum be damned. ''I initially thought it was the president,'' recalled Representative Joseph Crowley, Democrat of Queens.
No. Just the representative from the Eighth Congressional District of Arizona: Gabrielle Giffords.
Seven months ago, Ms. Giffords, 41, was performing a fundamental duty of her job -- meeting constituents in front of a supermarket -- when a gunman opened fire, killing six and wounding 13. Critically wounded, she has endured several surgeries and months of rehabilitation with uncommon resolve, and now here she was among us, determined to cast her yes vote.
With that, the days' moments of smallness -- of parsed words and posturing -- evaporated. No matter how one felt about her vote, Ms. Giffords was returning grandeur to the House.
The slight woman, her glasses large, her brown hair cropped short, her presence smaller yet larger, accepted the enveloping ovation. She sat down. She waved. She voted yes on a bill that by now had passed.
After it was over, Mr. Crowley, nearly 6-foot-5 and 255 pounds, carved a path through the crush, leading the way for Ms. Giffords as she walked gingerly, and with assistance, out of the chamber. He still felt the greeting touch of her hand on his cheek.
''Make way, please,'' called Mr. Crowley, now a proud sergeant-at-arms. ''Make way.''

HEADLINE: A Crisis Merely Postponed

BYLINE: By ERSKINE B. BOWLES and ALAN K. SIMPSON. 
Erskine B. Bowles and Alan K. Simpson were co-chairmen of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform.

 BODY:
LAST month, President Obama and Congressional leaders came close to an agreement that could have set our nation on a sound fiscal path, only to see deal after deal, compromise after compromise, collapse.
The debt deal that Congress finally approved on Tuesday, however, is a start. It calls for at least $2.1 trillion in deficit reduction, including, starting in the fall, caps on discretionary spending worth around $900 billion in savings over 10 years, which is not chump change in anyone's book. It represents an important first step toward fiscal sanity, and by taking it we have avoided default and thus a potential financial crisis. We hope to avoid a costly downgrade to our debt as well.
The problem with the plan is that it's just a step forward; it isn't a solution. It leaves more than half of its work -- finding at least $1.2 trillion in savings to avert an automatic set of cuts -- to a new bipartisan Congressional committee. Even if that committee is successful, more tough work will be necessary to avoid, a few years down the road, another crisis over the deficit. 
This country needs a plan to reduce our deficits by no less than $4 trillion in the next decade. It needs a plan to cut more wasteful spending in the defense and nondefense budgets than this deal does. In addition, we must address the unsustainable growth of our entitlement programs and reform the tax code to make it more competitive and more efficient.
The bipartisan committee must take on these challenges. It should find savings of far more than $1.2 trillion to get the deficit on track toward sustainability and to reassure markets, maintain our credibility, keep interest rates down and restore Americans' faith in the political system. To do this, it cannot avoid addressing the ''big ticket'' items -- Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security solvency and tax reform.
If we can't find a way to slow the rapid rise of health care costs, they will drive this country to bankruptcy. We should ask more of health care providers and drug companies through adjustments in payment formulas and increased drug rebates for Medicaid and Medicare, more from beneficiaries through more rational cost-sharing rules that discourage the overutilization of care, and more from lawyers through tort reform. And we need to cap growth in the long run.
If we don't reform Social Security to achieve sustainable solvency, we will not only place an undue burden on future generations, we will leave all beneficiaries with a 23 percent across-the-board benefit cut in 2036. To avoid drastic changes later, we need to make modest changes now -- like gradually increasing the retirement age, slowing the growth of benefits for higher earners and asking them to contribute a little more in payroll taxes. These changes can and should be made in a way that actually improves retirement security for the most vulnerable.
And we must address the tax code. We need new revenue to finance the increasing costs of our health care system and an aging population -- but it should come from reducing or eliminating tax breaks, not from higher rates. The tax code is riddled with annual tax breaks amounting to $1 trillion -- most of which are just government spending in disguise. By reforming them, we can reduce individual and corporate tax rates in a way that keeps the tax code progressive while promoting economic growth and reducing the deficit at the same time.
To do all this, the new committee must be bipartisan and bold. It must resist the temptation to simply recommend the bare minimum necessary to avert the next crisis instead of truly dealing with our long-term fiscal problem. The leaders of Congress must appoint members who will come to the committee with a willingness to reach a principled compromise that puts national interests ahead of partisan ones.
We were co-chairmen of a similar bipartisan group on debt reduction last year, and titled our final report ''The Moment of Truth.'' Of all our prescriptions, the most pertinent today is the one alluded to in the title: we must act now. If our government cannot address these terribly tough issues at a time when the public's attention is fully on them, when will we ever be able to?
The committee must begin its work immediately. We can reform our budget gradually without disrupting a very fragile economic recovery, but reform it we must.

HEADLINE: With Debt Ceiling Fight Behind Him, Obama Promises Action on Jobs

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and JEFF ZELENY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Having ceded considerable ground to Republicans in the debt ceiling fight, President Obama set out Tuesday to reclaim the initiative on the economy, promising a new effort to spur job creation while seeking to position himself as a proven voice of reason in an era of ideological overreach.
After being cloistered in Washington for a month haggling with Congressional leaders, Mr. Obama will embark on a bus tour of the Midwest the week of Aug. 15 -- a chance to show his commitment to reviving the economy in a region of important electoral battlegrounds, and to turn the page from the tangled, often toxic, debate in the capital.
On the policy front, Mr. Obama shifted quickly to pushing Congress to adopt a raft of familiar measures to stimulate the flagging economy, including extending the payroll tax suspension for workers, beefing up benefits for the unemployed, approving trade agreements and investing in infrastructure projects. 
''While deficit reduction is part of that agenda, it is not the whole agenda,'' a grim-faced Mr. Obama said in the Rose Garden moments after the Senate approved the debt limit deal. ''Growing the economy isn't just about cutting spending.'' He later added: ''That's not how we're going to get past this recession. We're going to have to do more than that.''
But the debt ceiling plan, with its emphasis on cutting government spending, underscores the constrained atmosphere in which Mr. Obama is operating. While he promised on Tuesday to present new ideas to encourage companies to hire workers, a senior aide acknowledged that Mr. Obama had no ''magic beads.''
And given the polarized climate on Capitol Hill, winning legislative approval of his initiatives, already daunting in most cases, will be that much more challenging.
Mr. Obama's embrace of deficit reduction provides him an opportunity to help win back the independent voters who were crucial to his victory in 2008. But the president may need to do some repair work with Democrats angered by the deep cuts in the plan -- and a perception, held by some liberals, that Mr. Obama was rolled by the Republicans in the House.
On Wednesday, he will attend a Democratic fund-raiser in Chicago on the eve of his 50th birthday, his first chance since the end of the debt showdown to frame a contrast with the Republicans in a purely political environment.
''There are parts of the base that are discouraged,'' Ted Strickland, a former Democratic governor of Ohio, said in an interview. ''I don't know that it's the result of any personal animosity toward the president, but going forward it's going to be important for him to inspire us, lead us, challenge us and be a real leader.''
White House officials dispute that the president is in trouble with Democratic voters, whom they say support the debt compromise by solid margins. But there was considerable fence-mending among important Democratic constituency groups. On Tuesday morning, Mr. Obama met with leaders of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. at the White House, while other Democrats scrambled to explain the positive aspects of the deal to influence liberal groups.
Compared with previous landmark legislation, Mr. Obama was uncharacteristically low key in the wake of the Senate vote, in effect keeping the deal at arm's length. He signed the bill, known as the Budget Control Act of 2011, into law in the Oval Office, with only a few advisers watching and no Congressional leaders on hand. Only a White House photographer recorded the moment. Aside from his remarks in the Rose Garden, he gave no interviews.
While Mr. Obama is hitting the road, White House officials said he would not promote the deal, about which he himself has said he has qualms. If anything, he seems likely to let the matter drop for at least a few days. As one senior aide said, ''You want to let the acid out of the air after it's over.''
Still, heading into an election year, Mr. Obama's advisers say he will be able to point to his role in the debt negotiations as proof of his ability to be a mature, responsible leader who is able to rise above Washington's relentlessly partisan fray. The president alluded to that on Tuesday, saying it should not take a ''timer ticking down'' to disaster to get Republicans and Democrats to work together.
''Voters may have chosen divided government,'' Mr. Obama said, ''but they sure didn't vote for dysfunctional government.''
David Axelrod, one of Mr. Obama's closest advisers, said the negotiations showed that ''he's been willing throughout the presidency to forgo scoring the cheap political point to serve the larger interest.''
After Labor Day, the White House also plans to hold town-hall-style meetings where Mr. Obama can talk about the issues, like Medicare and Medicaid, that dominated the recent fiscal debate and will resurface again when a Congressional committee convenes to hash out a second set of deficit-cutting measures. The president will also challenge Republicans to propose their own ideas for reviving the job market.
Mr. Obama's willingness to engage in serious deficit reduction, aides said, could buy him credibility for his other economic proposals. But Mr. Obama is unlikely to unveil any major new stimulus proposals, since he has exhausted most of the obvious policy options.
''Did he just find a little bit of oxygen to pursue a portion of his economic agenda?'' said Jared Bernstein, a former chief economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. ''He may be able to move some helpful things, but even if he can't, he can certainly go out and push for them.''
The relief in the corridors of the West Wing that an economic calamity had been averted was palpable. But few officials disputed that the deadlock had been a costly distraction from the administration's agenda. Party surveys show that Mr. Obama has been sullied -- along with all politicians in Washington -- with independent voters.
The vote tally in the House and the Senate, while stronger than many administration officials had expected only days ago, underscored deep divisions among Democrats across the country. In some states, there was a split between urban and rural legislators, while in other battleground states, entire delegations opposed the plan.
But Jim Messina, the manager of the president's re-election bid, said the discord among Democrats in Washington did not reflect what campaign officials were hearing from rank-and-file supporters of the president through nightly telephone calls and door-knocking.
''There's a lot of enthusiasm, and I don't see anything as contentious as this coming down the pike in terms of an intraparty situation,'' said David Plouffe, a senior adviser to the president. ''There will be a unified, motivated and very aggressive Democratic Party supporting the president next year.''

HEADLINE: Senate Leaves F.A.A. in Limbo

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT; Robert Pear contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- After dealing with the debt crisis, Senate negotiators tried and failed on Tuesday to end a stalemate over temporary financing for the Federal Aviation Administration, leaving 4,000 agency employees out of work and relying on airport safety inspectors to continue working without pay.
The partial agency shutdown, which began on July 23 and is likely to continue at least through Labor Day, has also idled tens of thousands of construction workers on airport projects around the country. Dozens of airport inspectors have been asked by the F.A.A. to work without pay and to charge their government travel expenses to their personal credit cards to keep airports operating safely.
Air traffic controllers and airplane inspectors, who are paid with separate accounts, have continued to work, but workers who oversee research on aviation systems, grants for airports and facilities and operations equipment have been furloughed.
If the stalemate continues through Labor Day, the government could lose roughly $1 billion in tax revenues on airline ticket sales. 
Ray LaHood, the transporta-tion secretary, said he firmly believed that passenger safety was not at risk.
''No safety issues will be compromised,'' Mr. LaHood told reporters on a conference call. ''Flying is safe. Air traffic controllers are guiding airplanes. Safety inspectors are on duty and are doing their job. No one needs to worry about safety.''
The House began its August recess on Monday night, and the Senate followed Tuesday, leaving little hope for a resolution until Congress returns in September. President Obama, in remarks after the Senate's passage of the debt ceiling bill, urged Congress to break the impasse, which he described as ''another Washington-inflicted wound on America.''
The impasse centers on disagreements between Republicans and Democrats over a program that subsidizes commercial air service to rural airports. But behind the scenes, a larger fight has been taking place over federal rules on labor elections in the airline industry.
Randy Babbitt, the F.A.A. administrator, said in a conference call with reporters on Tuesday that the agency was depending on the ''professionalism'' of airport safety inspectors to continue their work without being paid, because their jobs are paid for with money that is awaiting Congressional authorization.
Those inspectors are the primary individuals responsible for ensuring that commercial airports comply with federal regulations. They also support runway safety action teams, oversee construction safety plans, investigate runway incursions and ensure that corrective action is taken on safety discrepancies.
''The reason they are out on the job is because of the risk to operational safety or life and property,'' Mr. Babbitt said. ''We can neither pay them nor can we compensate them for expenses. We are depending and living on their professionalism at this point.''
It is unclear how long the inspectors can continue to pay the bills for their own travel and hotel expenses. Typically, each of the roughly 40 regional inspectors travels to up to five airports in each two-week period, F.A.A. officials said.
When F.A.A. financing expired last month, the agency also lost the ability to collect taxes on airline tickets. Those taxes amount to about $30 million a day and are paid into a trust fund that pays for much of its operations.
The House passed a bill last month that would extend F.A.A. financing through Sept. 16 and allow it to continue collecting the ticket tax. Congress has passed 20 such temporary spending bills over the last four years, in part because it has been unable to agree on a larger, long-term authorization of the agency's budget and capital plans.
But the House temporary bill also would end $14 million in subsidies that provided commercial airline service to 16 rural airports. The law was written in a way that appeared to single out for closing airports in the states of prominent Senate Democrats, including the majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada.
Democrats say Republicans are trying to save a few million dollars at the expense of the ticket tax, which would generate roughly $200 million a week.
Some of the airport closings were included in a long-term spending bill passed by the Senate in February. But Senate Democrats, including Senator John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia who is chairman of the committee with jurisdiction over the F.A.A., objected to their inclusion in what they said should have been a ''clean'' temporary spending measure.
Mr. Rockefeller tried to draft a compromise with Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas, that offered to cut $70 million from the rural airport program -- several times more than the amount that the Republican bill sought to cut. That effort was blocked by Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah.
''We are going to lose $1 billion in the aviation trust fund if we leave this Congress for the month of August and we don't extend the F.A.A.,'' Ms. Hutchison said.
Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, accused Republicans of ''hostage taking'' by refusing to approve an F.A.A. spending bill without including the rural air service cuts.
Representative John L. Mica, a Florida Republican who is chairman of the House transportation committee, said the rural air cuts were intended to reduce wasteful spending, like the subsidies of more than $3,700 per passenger that paid for air service in Ely, Nev., that benefits fewer than 500 passengers a year.
''Those 4,000 F.A.A. employees have been furloughed so some in the Senate can protect their own political pork,'' Mr. Mica said.
Mr. Reid said Republicans were using the rural airport issue as cover for an effort to change a recently instituted federal labor regulation that made it easier for unions to organize at airline companies.
The new regulation, instituted by the National Mediation Board, requires an employee vote on labor representation to be approved by a majority of those voting. Previously, the rule required a majority of all affected employees, meaning that employees who failed to vote were counted as ''no'' votes.
Mr. Reid said Republicans were trying to reverse the rule to benefit Delta Air Lines and other companies that have fought against union representation for their workers. A bill passed this year by the House that would grant permanent reauthorization for F.A.A. operations included the labor provision that would change the ruling by the mediation board.
Mr. Hatch said the administration and Democrats in Congress were trying to ''put their thumb on the scale in favor of big labor.''
Senate Democrats had hoped that they could quickly pass a temporary spending bill on Tuesday without the rural airport provision, and offer it to the House during the recess. While House members are gone, the House officially reconvenes every few days for a few minutes, a technical move meant to block recess appointments.
Senate Democrats maintained that the House, in one of those sessions, could adopt a clean spending bill by unanimous consent. But ultimately they were not able to gather the forces to pass a new bill.

HEADLINE: Republicans Seeking Election Remain Unsure About Embracing Tea Party

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The success of Tea Party-backed lawmakers in defining the terms of the debt debate in Washington has further cemented the party's identity as part of a conservative movement insistent on deep spending cuts, lower taxes and smaller government.
But as Republican candidates gear up for 2012, many are struggling with whether to embrace those passions. Opposing the debt ceiling increase and linking arms with the Tea Party may help candidates tap into a reservoir of energy in their party's electorate. But it also threatens to alienate the candidates from independent voters who grimaced at the bickering in Washington this summer and preferred greater compromise on issues like tax increases. 
''The process didn't please anyone,'' said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster, ''but it was very clear that the new congressmen elected in 2010 dramatically shifted the debate from how much more shall we spend to how much shall we cut.''
In the coming 2012 elections, the strategic calculation for Republican candidates weighing Tea Party ties ''depends on the state, depends on the politician and it depends on the particular race,'' Mr. Ayres said.
Evidence of political uncertainty is everywhere, and this week's debt votes in Congress highlighted the Republican soul-searching, doing little to clarify a simple path to Republican victory.
The Tea Party caucus in the House split in half on the final debt ceiling vote. In the Senate on Tuesday, 19 of the chamber's 46 Republicans voted against the bill, while the rest sided with the party leadership in supporting it. Some of those facing Tea Party challenges, like Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, voted no, while others, like Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, voted yes.
The Tea Party had accused both Mr. Hatch and Mr. Lugar of failing to take the movement's conservative principles seriously. But on Tuesday, Mr. Lugar called the compromise bill to raise the nation's debt ceiling and cut federal spending a ''victory for conservative fiscal responsibility.'' He is betting -- or maybe, hoping -- that the Tea Party will agree.
Meanwhile, Mr. Hatch voted against the legislation, perhaps mindful of how easy it would be for conservatives who seek to oust him to turn a ''yes'' vote into an effective bumper-sticker slogan suggesting he is in favor of more government spending.
''Orrin has made the decision to highlight every ultraconservative vote he's ever made, and he's going around saying 'I was Tea Party before it was cool to be Tea Party.''' said Bob Bennett, a former Republican senator from Utah who was defeated by a Tea Party candidate in the Republican primary in 2010.
''I have no way of knowing at this point how that's going to play out,'' Mr. Bennett, now at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said in an interview Tuesday. ''We all agree we want smaller government and less intrusive government. But when you move to specifics, the unanimity breaks down.''
For the Republican lawmakers, their votes represented a complex interplay of ideology and political reality -- like when and against whom they face an election-year challenge. The debate has also put the party's presidential candidates on the spot as they struggle to attract Tea Party support in nominating contests months away, while remaining mindful of a more centrist general electorate.
For the presidential candidates, their stand on the debt ceiling could become a new proxy for their allegiance -- or lack of it -- to the Tea Party. And it could serve as a test of how far a Republican candidate can push back against the movement's all-or-nothing approach to governing, especially during primary season.
Over the weekend, Mitt Romney, who is seeking the party's presidential nomination, condemned the deal after weeks of noticeable silence on the issue, while Jon M. Huntsman Jr., a Romney rival, called it ''a positive step.''
''Jon Huntsman was the only one who said given the choice before us, 'choose to pay our bills,' '' said Mr. Ayres, who serves as the chief pollster for Mr. Huntsman's campaign. ''When you are balancing the future fiscal reputation of the country, one would hope that real leaders would stand up and call for the country to avoid default.''
The other leading presidential hopefuls are betting that Mr. Huntsman's argument will not hold up to scrutiny among Republican primary voters in places like Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. And the candidates are eager to maintain a sharp contrast with President Obama by opposing a high-profile bargain he made.
''Mr. President, the real losers in the budget deal were the American people who will continue to be subjected to your failed economic policies,'' Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota said in a statement Tuesday.
Republican candidates who supported the debt limit compromise face threats of retribution from groups like the Club for Growth. But other conservatives are more forgiving, urging Tea Party members not to turn the 2011 debt-limit vote into a litmus test issue like the 2008 bank bailout vote known as TARP was.
Richard Viguerie, a veteran of decades in the antitax trenches, issued a statement on Tuesday calling the debt vote something on which ''honest conservatives'' could disagree and urging unity.
''This is not the time to start fighting amongst ourselves,'' Mr. Viguerie said. ''Nothing could make the left happier than to see a splintering of the Tea Party movement.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Seeks More Pressure on Syria, but Options Are Limited

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS and NEIL MacFARQUHAR; Steven Lee Myers reported from Washington, and Neil MacFarquhar from the United Nations. Ellen Barry contributed reporting from Moscow.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration is facing intensifying calls to punish Syria more forcefully for its bloody crackdown on protests, but officials say that without broader international support they have few options to increase pressure on President Bashar al-Assad's government.
A group of senators introduced legislation on Tuesday that would impose even stronger economic sanctions against Syria than those already imposed against Mr. Assad and a coterie of senior aides. Italy, meanwhile, withdrew its ambassador to Syria and called on other nations to do so, echoing calls by Republicans for President Obama to do the same. 
In New York, the United Nations Security Council discussed the violence for a second day on Tuesday but remained divided over how strongly to react. A spokesman for the United Nations secretary general issued the organization's sharpest criticism yet, saying Mr. Assad had ''lost all sense of humanity.''
In Washington, administration officials vowed tougher measures but stopped short of announcing any new ones, underscoring how difficult a diplomatic and political challenge the crackdown in Syria has become for Mr. Obama.
The administration plans to expand on sanctions first imposed in May, officials said, but the legal process for doing that has lagged behind Syria's accelerating violence against protesters, including brutal attacks that began on Sunday in Hama and other cities. The conflict has claimed the lives of more than 1,500 Syrians since March, according to the United Nations, which cited human rights groups' reports.
The American ambassador to Syria, Robert S. Ford, testifying before the Senate on Tuesday, said sanctions against senior Syrian officials were beginning to bite. He also disclosed that the administration was discussing additional sanctions with the Europeans that would have a more direct effect, since those imposed by the United States already severely limit American trade with Syria.
Underscoring the administration's clear but not explicitly stated goal of a new government in Syria, Mr. Ford said it was important that any punitive sanctions be calibrated in such a way as to not devastate the economy in a ''post-Assad'' era.
After initially holding out hope that Mr. Assad would heed the protests that have swept the Arab world this year, Mr. Obama has steadily intensified his criticism -- only to watch Syrian security forces respond to protesters with more and more force.
Diplomatically, the administration has concentrated its efforts on solidifying international condemnation of Mr. Assad's government, pressing members of the United Nations Security Council to consider a resolution initially floated by Britain in May but blocked by opposition from Russia and other nations angered in part by the NATO-led military operation against Libya.
''The international community has required more prodding in this case than in the case of Libya,'' a senior administration official said on Tuesday.
The conflict in Libya, in fact, has haunted the administration's handling of Syria in many ways, underscoring the limit of American political influence and military power in the two countries.
While Mr. Obama explicitly called for Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi's ouster, even an American-supported air war backing Libyan rebels has so far failed to bring about his removal. Administration officials say that the United States has even fewer levers in the case of Syria, given that a military option has been all but ruled out and Syria still has support from Arab League members and other countries.
There were signs on Tuesday that the attacks over the weekend had deepened Syria's diplomatic isolation. Russia, an important ally, signaled new support for some Security Council action, though it was unclear how far it would go. ''We are not categorically against everything,'' Sergei Vershinin, a department head within the Russian Foreign Ministry, said in Moscow. ''We are categorically against what doesn't help bring forward a peaceful settlement.''
Other members of the Security Council previously opposed to action -- including Brazil, South Africa and India -- said they would support condemning the violence. But it was unclear whether a resolution or weaker statement would emerge, with negotiations stuck over several issues. Western nations, for example, were adamant that government violence against civilians not be equated with scattered attacks by protesters against security forces. Bartering was set to resume Wednesday.
Mr. Obama's aides have defended what they call the administration's measured approach, saying it was important for the United States to build consensus. On Sunday, Mr. Obama condemned President Assad, saying ''his use of torture, corruption and terror puts him on the wrong side of history.''
The president could still explicitly call for Mr. Assad's removal as part of a deliberate escalation of American efforts, the senior administration official said.
For now, the administration has been scrambling for ways to demonstrate support for the protesters.
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met privately on Tuesday with Syrian and Syrian-American democracy advocates at the State Department. She told them she had ''confidence in the Syrian people's ability to chart a new course for Syria,'' a spokesman, Mark C. Toner, said.
Mr. Ford, the ambassador, testified before the Senate's Foreign Relations Committee as lawmakers considered confirming his appointment, which was blocked last year by members protesting Syria's meddling in Lebanon, forcing Mr. Obama to use a recess appointment to install him.
''It's really important now to give Syrians an ear and to amplify their voices -- especially when the international media is barred from Syria,'' Mr. Ford said. ''I have been trying to draw the attention of the Syrian regime and the attention of the international community to the legitimate grievances the Syrian people have with their government.''
The three senators from across the political spectrum who introduced legislation Tuesday -- Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Mark Kirk of Illinois and Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut -- proposed enacting sanctions similar to those against Iran that would punish international companies doing business with Syria's energy sector.
Danielle Pletka, vice president for Foreign and Defense Policy Studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative advocacy group, said that the administration could do more by, for example, withdrawing the American ambassador, as Italy did.

HEADLINE: Aviation Club Secures a Home on Park Avenue, in a Space With Significance

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE NEGRONI

 BODY:
In the 1950s, when commercial aviation was growing and space travel captured the American imagination, the Wings Club of New York settled into a first-class home. Over the next several decades, it was a congenial gathering spot for aviators, celebrities and even presidents.
Candles glowed on birthday cakes sometimes delivered by beautiful flight attendants. Drinks were served in the club bar. Late-evening songfests were held around the piano. 
But as air travel changed in the last decade, so did the Wings Club. In 2002, high rent and an economic downturn forced the club from its deluxe Manhattan home and left it without a place to call its own.
So the club -- which is part social, part professional and part dedicated to aviation education and related charities -- was happy that it found a new meeting place this summer. And it was doubly pleased that the new address is in the MetLife Building on Park Avenue -- one of the most famous aviation landmarks in the city, from its days as the headquarters of Pan Am.
''This is a place to actually plant the flag,'' said David McKay, the club's president, ''a place that is a symbol, a place for the board to meet, because I think it represents permanence and that's something we want to foster.''
When the club was founded in 1942, it was a tenant at the Yale Club on Vanderbilt Avenue. World War II pilots used the place as a hangout and sometimes as a hotel.
In the 1950s, the club moved into the luxury Biltmore Hotel near Grand Central Terminal.
''In the early years, it was very prestigious to be a member,'' said Harris Herman, general manager of the club and, in the 1990s, one of the committee of 12 that scrutinized each membership application. ''It has always been something that people wanted to be part of.''
By the '70s, the Wings Club had a membership of 1,500, including its first female members, as well as celebrity honorary members like Jimmy Doolittle, Arthur Godfrey and Curtis LeMay. Executives of Pan Am, TWA, Eastern and American -- airlines that were, at that time, based in New York -- were also members.
When the Biltmore Hotel was demolished in 1981, the club moved into equally deluxe accommodations at 52 Vanderbilt Avenue. In the dining room, white linen draped the tables and steak was served on china. In the library, members could order a drink while talking about flying.
The terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, changed much about aviation, and the Wings Club, whose budget comes from dues and corporate donations, was no exception. In 2002, the club closed the doors on its spacious 18th-floor haven and spent the longest time since its founding without a place to call home.
Reopening in the former headquarters of Pan Am is special for the club, which now has a membership of 1,200.
''There's this wonderful connective tissue that just runs through the entire place,'' said Mr. McKay, who is the president of United States Aviation Underwriters, the insurance firm.
The Pan Am Building was once under consideration to be the home of the club, in 1963. Pan Am's most famous executive, Juan Trippe, was a club member, and Mr. Trippe's personal pilot, Albert Ueltschi, founded the aviation training company Flight Safety International. The chief executive of that company, Bruce Whitman, will lead the Wings Club in 2012.
The new club, however, much like the state of contemporary aviation, is a stripped-down version of its former self. Gone are the plush library, the dining room, the wood-paneled bar. With more than a nod to how airlines have eliminated meals and free checked bags, the 2011 Wings Club consists of a boardroom, a kitchen and a workspace for visiting members' use.
Still, some gracious touches remain. On the walls hangs a collection of aviation art by John T. McCoy, Clayton Knight and the famed painter of clouds Eric Sloane. The collection has been appraised at more than $500,000. Framed photos of events at the club are also on display.
John Kent, now retired, lunched regularly at the Biltmore and Vanderbilt Avenue sites when he was an airline pilot based in New York and flying 747s for United Airlines. In the spring of 1987, he arranged a party at the club to celebrate the birthday of the World War I flying ace George Vaughn. Attendees reminisced about Charles Lindbergh, whom some knew personally.
In the new club, photos of Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and George Bush and the pioneering 1930s-era pilot Jacqueline Cochran hang on the walls. They were honored guests, as were the actors James Stewart and Cliff Robertson. Attendees at annual galas have included the astronauts John Glenn and Kathryn Sullivan.
Performing was another part of the club culture, according to a written history that recounts some late-night songfests. For a members' dinner in 1996, Robert Crandall, then the head of American Airlines, appeared in a video playing the piano and singing a satirical version of the song ''My Way'' dedicated to Herb Kelleher, founder of Southwest Airlines.
The club's monthly lunches are still held at the Yale Club, where members have dining and hotel privileges that supplement the limited offerings at the new clubhouse.
''It's not glitzy like it was 30 years ago,'' Mr. Herman said. ''I never thought we'd open this club. In the dark days, when we had to close and move, I thought it would just be too expensive, because I was thinking, dining room, kitchen, bar, library.''
''I don't think it requires a fancy, jazzy thing,'' Mr. McKay rushed to add.
Access to the movers and shakers in the industry is what the club has always been about, Mr. McKay said. ''Being in the roster with Bob Crandall and Herb Kelleher has some value to some people,'' he said. ''If I wanted to pick up the phone and dial Richard Branson, I could. And he would probably pick up the phone. I think that's remarkable. Quite frankly, that's enough.''

C.E.O. RISK PREMIUM MF Global, the commodities and derivatives broker led by Jon S. Corzine, offered to sell five-year notes on Tuesday with an unusual twist: The notes promise to pay an extra 1 percent in the interest rate in the event of ''the departure of Mr. Corzine as our full time chief executive officer due to his appointment to a federal position by the President of the United States and confirmation of that appointment by the United States Senate prior to July 1, 2013,'' according to a preliminary prospectus. 
POISON PILL Talbots has adopted a shareholder rights plan, or a poison pill, a day after a private equity firm disclosed that it had acquired a big stake in the company. The private equity firm, Sycamore Partners, said on Monday that it had accumulated a 9.9 percent stake in Talbots and would seek to talk to management about the retailer's strategy and operations. JEFFREY CANE
EARNINGS RISE Och-Ziff Capital Management, the hedge fund firm run by Daniel S. Och, said on Tuesday that second-quarter earnings, when charges related to its initial public offering are stripped out, rose 19 percent. On the basis of generally accepted accounting principles, however, the company lost $93.4 million, more than the $89.4 million it lost in the period a year ago. AZAM AHMED
BRAZILIAN BEER DEAL Kirin Holdings of Japan agreed on Tuesday to pay $2.6 billion for a controlling stake in Schincariol, one of the largest beer and soft drink producers in Brazil. The already sizable beer and soft drinks market in Brazil promises to benefit from significant wealth and population growth in coming years, Kirin said. BETTINA WASSENER

HEADLINE: Little in Telmex For Shareholders

BYLINE: By ROBERT CYRAN and ROB COX

 BODY:
The Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim Helu's $6.5 billion tender offer for Telmex offers little for shareholders in his America Movil, the large cellphone carrier, to be happy about. America Movil is buying out the remainder of Telmex, the country's shrinking landline business, at a premium valuation relative to its own. That looks like a bad exchange.
As a landline operator, Telmex's best days lie behind it. Customers are going mobile, disconnecting lines and making fewer calls. Data services are growing, but not fast enough to offset declines elsewhere. Revenue at Telmex peaked in 2007 and has fallen steadily since. By contrast, America Movil is growing, even if Latin America is not the virgin market it once was. Revenue was up 8 percent last year. 
Yet America Movil's offer for the 40 percent in Telmex it does not already own comes at an 11 percent premium to where the stock has traded over the last 30 days. That's equal to about 12 times Telmex's estimated 2012 earnings. America Movil, on the other hand, trades at 11 times.
There are some benefits. Telmex should generate about $2 billion of free cash flow this year. While America Movil already consolidates Telmex's results, full ownership would mean it does not have to cede big dividends to outside shareholders. Moreover, since debt is cheap and America Movil is paying in cash, the acquisition could slightly lower the company's cost of capital.
Finally, even though the two companies already work together closely, there may be some operational benefits. Redundant managers can be let go and bundles of services may eventually be offered to existing customers.
If cost savings do not appear, it will take many years of the extra cash flow to compensate for the billions America Movil is paying. Indeed, if Telmex keeps losing business, which seems inevitable, America Movil may never reap an acceptable return on its investment. The $5 billion fall in America Movil's market value on Tuesday suggests minority investors would have preferred a dividend. But with Mr. Slim running the show, it does not really matter what other investors want.
Growing Pains
It's not easy being a Japanese company. The home market is not just economically stagnant, it is expected to shrink by a million consumers a year for the next two decades. So, the logic goes, Japanese corporations must expand abroad. But as the beer giant Kirin's latest takeover of an overseas asset attests, that's a poor story for shareholders.
Kirin is paying 3.95 billion reais ($2.6 billion) for a 50.45 percent stake in Schincariol, Brazil's distant No. 2 brewer after Anheuser-Busch InBev. According to Schincariol's published financial statements, the group made 54 million reais last year. Valuing the whole of the Brazilian group's equity at 7.9 billion reais means Kirin is paying around 146 times earnings. Oh, and those earnings fell 28 percent in 2010 from the previous year.
Kirin spins a different case using more flattering accounting. It gives a valuation of around 16 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. But even that looks like an extravagance. It's about a third more expensive than the average beer deal, and it's also about double the multiple that Kirin fetches for its own earnings.
That might be defensible if Kirin had an edge, like the ability to cut costs or assist in geographic expansion. Kirin has neither. Indeed, until now the company had made clear its desire to focus on Asia and Oceania. Kirin's president, Senji Miyake, on Monday suggested Schincariol was just too good an opportunity to pass up. But even if Brazil's beer market is growing 10 percent a year, his comments smack of adventurism, not focus.
And without overlap, there are no obvious cost savings to be realized from the deal. That stands in marked contrast to the other industry deal currently fermenting, SABMiller's unsolicited $12 billion bid for Australia-based Foster's. SAB offered just 12 times Ebitda partly because it is only able to extract a few hundred million dollars of savings.
So Kirin is overpaying, has no obvious mechanism to extract value and is drifting from its geographic strategy. That pretty well sums up what it's like to be a Japanese company shopping overseas.
Of course, there is an alternative. Two years ago, Kirin nearly merged with a domestic rival, Suntory. The projected cost savings would have been worth nearly as much as Kirin's current $14 billion market capitalization. That would have been a party worth going to.

HEADLINE: The Strike That Busted Unions

BYLINE: By JOSEPH A. McCARTIN. 
Joseph A. McCartin, an associate professor of history at Georgetown University, is the author of the forthcoming ''Collision Course: , Ronald Reagan, the Air Traffic Controllers, and the Strike That Changed America.''

 BODY:
Washington
THIRTY years ago today, when he threatened to fire nearly 13,000 air traffic controllers unless they called off an illegal strike, Ronald Reagan not only transformed his presidency, but also shaped the world of the modern workplace.
More than any other labor dispute of the past three decades, Reagan's confrontation with the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization, or Patco, undermined the bargaining power of American workers and their labor unions. It also polarized our politics in ways that prevent us from addressing the root of our economic troubles: the continuing stagnation of incomes despite rising corporate profits and worker productivity.
By firing those who refused to heed his warning, and breaking their union, Reagan took a considerable risk. Even his closest advisers worried that a major air disaster might result from the wholesale replacement of striking controllers. Air travel was significantly curtailed, and it took several years and billions of dollars (much more than Patco had demanded) to return the system to its pre-strike levels. 
But the risk paid off for Reagan in the short run. He showed federal workers and Soviet leaders alike how tough he could be. Although there were 39 illegal work stoppages against the federal government between 1962 and 1981, no significant federal job actions followed Reagan's firing of the Patco strikers. His forceful handling of the walkout, meanwhile, impressed the Soviets, strengthening his hand in the talks he later pursued with Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
Yet three decades later, with the economy shrinking or stagnant for nearly four years now and Reagan's party moving even further to the right than where he stood, the long-term costs of his destruction of the union loom ever larger. It is clear now that the fallout from the strike has hurt workers and distorted our politics in ways Reagan himself did not advocate.
Although a conservative, Reagan often argued that private sector workers' rights to organize were fundamental in a democracy. He not only made this point when supporting Lech Walesa's anti-Communist Solidarity movement in Poland; he also boasted of being the first president of the Screen Actors Guild to lead that union in a strike. Over time, however, his crushing of the controllers' walkout -- which he believed was justified because federal workers were not allowed under the law to strike -- has helped undermine the private-sector rights he once defended.
Workers in the private sector had used the strike as a tool of leverage in labor-management conflicts between World War II and 1981, repeatedly withholding their work to win fairer treatment from recalcitrant employers. But after Patco, that weapon was largely lost. Reagan's unprecedented dismissal of skilled strikers encouraged private employers to do likewise. Phelps Dodge and International Paper were among the companies that imitated Reagan by replacing strikers rather than negotiating with them. Many other employers followed suit.
By 2010, the number of workers participating in walkouts was less than 2 percent of what it had been when Reagan led the actors' strike in 1952. Lacking the leverage that strikes once provided, unions have been unable to pressure employers to increase wages as productivity rises. Inequality has ballooned to a level not seen since Reagan's boyhood in the 1920s.
Although he opposed government strikes, Reagan supported government workers' efforts to unionize and bargain collectively. As governor, he extended such rights in California. As president he was prepared to do the same. Not only did he court and win Patco's endorsement during his 1980 campaign, he directed his negotiators to go beyond his legal authority to offer controllers a pay raise before their strike -- the first time a president had ever offered so much to a federal employees' union.
But the impact of the Patco strike on Reagan's fellow Republicans has long since overshadowed his own professed beliefs regarding public sector unions. Over time the rightward-shifting Republican Party has come to view Reagan's mass firings not as a focused effort to stop one union from breaking the law -- as Reagan portrayed it -- but rather as a blow against public sector unionism itself.
In the spring, Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin invoked Reagan's handling of Patco as he prepared to ''change history'' by stripping public employees of collective bargaining rights in a party-line vote. ''I'm not negotiating,'' Mr. Walker said. By then the world had seemingly forgotten that unlike Mr. Walker, Reagan had not challenged public employees' right to bargain -- only their right to strike.
With Mr. Walker's militant anti-union views now ascendant within the party of a onetime union leader, with workers less able to defend their interests in the workplace than at any time since the Depression, the long-term consequences continue to unfold in ways Reagan himself could not have predicted -- producing outcomes for which he never advocated.

HEADLINE: Spending Cuts Seen as Step, but Not as a Cure

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- There is something you should know about the deal to cut federal spending that President Obama signed into law on Tuesday: It does not actually reduce federal spending.
By the end of the 10-year deal, the federal debt would be much larger than it is today.
Indeed, both the government and its debts will continue to grow faster than the American economy, primarily because the new law does not address federal spending on health care. 
That is the reason that the ratings agency Standard & Poor's and its rivals still are threatening to remove the United States from their lists of risk-free borrowers, although the other agencies, Moody's and Fitch, both said Tuesday that they would watch and wait for now.
It is also the reason that many conservative Republicans refused to vote for the agreement, calling it a grossly inadequate answer to a pressing problem.
''The current deal to raise the debt ceiling doesn't stop us from going over the fiscal cliff,'' Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, wrote Monday in an open letter explaining his opposition. ''At best, it slows us from going over it at 80 m.p.h. to going over it at 60 m.p.h..''
Proponents of the deal counter that it is an important first step, constrained by the political realities of divided government. Republicans want to reduce the debt solely through cuts in spending, while Democrats favor a mix of cuts and increased revenues.
Both parties are pointing to the 2012 elections as a national referendum on how to proceed.
''Is this the deal I would have preferred? No,'' Mr. Obama said Sunday in announcing the agreement. ''But this compromise does make a serious down payment on the deficit reduction we need, and gives each party a strong incentive to get a balanced plan done before the end of the year.''
The problem facing the nation has been clear for some time. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the federal debt is likely to exceed 100 percent of the nation's annual economic output by 2021, largely because of the rising cost of Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.
Americans will face higher taxes, particularly as investors begin to demand higher interest rates. Economists disagree about the amount of debt a nation can safely carry relative to the size of its economy, but there is widespread concern that 100 percent is too much, and that the weight of debt would begin to suppress economic activity.
Stabilizing that ratio would require about $4 trillion in cuts over the next decade, according to a number of independent analysts. That is also the target that S.&P. declared the nation must meet, and it was the goal of the ''grand bargain'' that Mr. Obama tried to reach last month with Speaker John A. Boehner.
The deal they reached instead contains cuts of at least $2.1 trillion over the next 10 years. By the end of that period, the federal debt could equal as much as 80 percent of economic activity, and rising. That assumes Congress chooses to preserve all of the Bush-era tax cuts, but even if Democrats succeeded in rolling back cuts for the wealthy, the ratio could reach 76 percent, and rising.
''This was a huge missed opportunity,'' said Maya MacGuineas, president of the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. ''Any sensible solution requires that you need to stabilize the debt so that it's not growing faster than the economy.''
Ms. MacGuineas, like many independent observers, also is concerned that the government is cutting back on spending too quickly. The debt-ceiling deal would reduce spending by only a few billion dollars this year. But the two sides could not agree to include extensions of payroll tax cuts or unemployment benefits, both scheduled to expire at the end of the year. Stimulus spending also is winding down.
''We needed to be more aware that we didn't derail the economy in the short run, and we needed more deficit reduction in the long run,'' she said. If the deal undermines the economic recovery, she noted, the decline in tax revenues could worsen the problem.
Although it does not solve the basic problem, the deal would impose real constraints on spending. The law creates a bipartisan commission to identify at least $1.2 trillion in spending cuts by Thanksgiving. It also caps the amounts that Congress can spend over the next decade in a trillion-dollar slice of the federal budget called discretionary spending, which includes, among other things, financing for transportation, basic research and the national defense.
To comply with the law, Congress must reduce appropriations by about $25 billion for the budget year that begins in October. The following year, appropriations can increase by $4 billion. Every year thereafter, spending can grow to keep pace with inflation.
The Congressional Budget Office calculated the financial impact of the plan by comparing it to a situation in which spending kept pace with inflation throughout the 10-year period, and concluded that the government would save about $917 billion -- including interest on money it would not need to borrow.
Assuming that the economy continues to grow, the affected government programs will receive an ever-smaller share of the nation's resources. Moreover, discretionary spending includes the cost of health care for veterans, which, like other health care costs, is climbing much faster than inflation, requiring a larger share of the available money with each passing year.
Proponents describe these constraints as necessary and significant.
''We are actually cutting spending,'' said Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin. ''That's cultural, that's significant, that's a big step in the right direction.''
Critics, however, are skeptical that Congress will follow through. They note that Congress imposed similar limits on spending in the 1980s and '90s, only to grant itself repeated exceptions. They said that cutting specific programs would be a more credible strategy.
''It does nothing to address the real drivers of our debt,'' said Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, explaining his decision to vote against the bill. ''It eliminates no program, consolidates no duplicative programs, cuts no tax earmarks and reforms no entitlement program.''

HEADLINE: The Premier League, Coming Soon to a Continent Near You

BYLINE: GRAHAM RUTHVEN


HIGHLIGHT: The Premier League has been studying ways to extend its brand, not just the reach of its individual teams, to new markets and new continents.

 BODY:
It's perhaps an indication of the ambitions of English soccer's top flight that is does not, in fact, include the word England in its title.
Known as the Premiership after its restructuring in 1992, and now as the Premier League, the omission offers something of a synopsis on the dramatic transformation the league has undertaken.
Then again, why should the word England feature? After all, the Premier League in its current form is no longer strictly English.
Drawing worldwide figures that now amount to the vast majority of the league's overall audience (an estimated 1 billion people were said to have watched Manchester United take on Arsenal last season despite only 1.1 million watching in England), the division has become not just a global interest but also a global brand. So, naturally, it now plans to take its product where demand is highest.
The Premier League already caters heavily for foreign markets and even alters kickoff times to suit overseas viewers -- usually in the Far East, since early afternoon starts in England makes the games available to large audiences in Asia. But now the Premier League's chief executive, Richard Scudamore, has proposed two preseason tournaments organized by the league to be played on two continents as he attempts to capitalize fully on the global appeal of England's top teams.Scudamore's aspirations for a truly global spectacle have been met with fierce opposition before. The infamous 39th game proposal was vetoed by the Premier League's member clubs and their supporters after being put forward three years ago, somewhat putting the buffers on Scudamore's plan for worldwide domination.
But does his latest proposal represent any true extension of the league?
Considering the Premier League already lends its brand name to a preseason tournament -- the Barclay's Asia Trophy is in its fourth year -- Scudamore seems guilty of artful deception. Chelsea and Liverpool have traveled to Asia to participate in various summer tournaments, and Manchester United spent its preseason touring the United States. Such is the appeal of the Premier League that it's not just the biggest teams that are benefiting from lucrative preseason tours; Blackburn, Aston Villa and even the newly promoted Queen's Park Rangers also ventured abroad during the summer months.
It would appear that Scudamore has seen the untapped revenue streams starting to be exploited by individual clubs and now wants to capitalize on these markets by extending the reach of the Premier League as a collective entity, as other leagues have.
The N.F.L. has played an annual regular season game at Wembley Stadium in London for four years running, and the N.B.A. ventured there for the first time last year after staging preseason games everywhere from Beijing to Berlin. Major League Baseball has gone to Japan, and the N.H.L. has wandered all over Europe.
In fact, Formula One's entire business plan revolves around touring the world's most lucrative markets, so much so that in recent years the traditional and spiritual homes of motorsports, such as the Nurburgring in Germany and Silverstone in England, have threatened by state-of-the-art tracks in booming economies (Singapore, India, China, the U.A.E.).
Many experts predict that eventually a European, or even world-wide, soccer super league will materialize, satisfying Scudamore's desire for a truly global game. But will his brand be the ones to pioneer such a division?
Will the omission of England from the Premier League's title look like prudent foresight, or will it remain as a symbol of an unfulfilled plan for domination?

HIGHLIGHT: Imaginary problems abroad, imaginary success at home.

 BODY:
Britain's experiment in austerity is going really, really badly. But the Chancellor of the Exchequer is finding solace in well, fantasy. Interest rates on UK debt are falling, and:
"This is proof that we are now seen as a safe haven, we're not seeing the increase in yields seen in Europe and the US," said Mr Osborne's spokesman. 
Yields in the US have, of course, plunged rather than risen. And they've plunged for the same reason UK yields have plunged: a scarily weak economy suggests that it will be years before the central bank raises rates.
For what it's worth, credit default swaps suggest that perceived risk of a UK default has been low all along, except for a panicky few months after Lehman. 
It's sad, actually: the wolf is at the door, and Osborne thinks it's the confidence fairy.

HEADLINE: The Economic Manifesto of Elliott's Paul Singer

BYLINE: EVELYN M. RUSLI and AZAM AHMED


HIGHLIGHT: In his 14,000-word letter to investors, Paul Singer, founder of the $17 billion hedge fund Elliott Management, attacks government officials in the United States and Europe for fiscal recklessness.

 BODY:
"Stability is not the way of the world."
That is how Paul Singer, founder of the $17 billion hedge fund Elliott Management, describes the current environment in his latest letter to investors, a 14,000-word screed that attacks government officials in the United States and Europe for their fiscal recklessness and portends an end to American hegemony should the ship not soon be righted.
In the colorful and often angry letter, Mr. Singer takes particular aim at the Federal Reserve (a "group of inbred academics," in his view) for their use of artificially low interest rates and quantitative easing to stimulate the economy. The approach, he said, has distorted the price of just about everything.
"The distortions in public policy in the U.S. and Europe have introduced extraordinary undercurrents which are hidden from sight, but they are entirely capable of changing the landscape very quickly, and probably not for the better," he said in the letter, which was obtained by DealBook.
 Mr. Singer, whose fund gained 1.1 percent in the second quarter, released the letter several weeks before Capitol Hill reached a compromise on the contentious debt ceiling issue. That battle does not fully account for the country's long term insolvency issues, he wrote, nor what he calls the "unpayable Big Three" -- Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.
"In both the U.S. and Europe, the budget and balance sheet numbers do not work," the letter said. "When 'off-balance sheet' promises are taken into account, the U.S. and most countries of the Euro zone are insolvent." And by extending reams of credit, the developed nations, he explained, are undermining their credibility, an erosion that -- once complete -- will exact untold consequences.
"As this is written, the prices of financial assets do not seem to take into account the risk of a history-altering reversal of confidence in paper money, the U.S. dollar, the American economy and its political leadership, or the Euro currency block."
"Yet poor policy and incompetent leaders are creating massive systemic risks, and modern markets can concentrate and change their focus instantly -- for all the right reasons, for no apparent reason, or for some combination of the two."
Given the Fed's "increasingly cavalier attitude" toward monetary policy, Mr. Singer said, it is up to the markets to "take away its freedom of action." In that event, Elliott expects a "collapse" in the dollar's exchange rate, a busted bond market and surging commodity prices -- all accompanied by extreme volatility in the equity markets.
And as for how to extract the economy from the depths of whatever reckoning is to come, history does not inspire confidence in the eyes of Mr. Singer. Calling the government's management of the financial crisis "horrendous," Mr. Singer said the stimulus plan was a failure that led to a uniquely feeble recovery and an employment situation that "is simply putrid."
"Instead of addressing the unsound financial system by deleveraging the banks, making them understandable and transparent, and modernizing the regulatory scheme, the bulk of the actions taken by the new government, starting in early 2009, consisted of an ideological wish-list and cronyism. Very little was oriented toward supporting the private sector, except for the surviving banks, which were nursed back to 'health' (that is, mostly as highly-leveraged trading shops) with lavish dollops of close-to-free money and blanket guarantees."
So what would it take to fix the current dilemmas outlined by Mr. Singer, a hardcore conservative?
"Some are consumed with guilt and cry plaintively, 'Tax me more, it feels so good!' But many others will take their jobs, projects and ideas elsewhere, to places where they are not just thought of as sheep to be fleeced. The world, in terms of choices available to educated, ambitious workers and entrepreneurs, is way bigger than just the United States, Japan and Europe."
Instead of raising taxes in a futile attempt to pay for burdensome entitlement programs, Mr. Singer said legislators should be focused on slashing obligations. He admitted that restructuring the health care system would require complex solutions, but Mr. Singer said there were also some easy fixes to trim costs, like lifting the retirement age or changing the way benefits are calculated.
And what to do about the Federal Reserve and its chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, whose confidence in the Fed's ability to control inflation seems "more like careless talk radio rants than expressions containing the prudence and conservatism needed from the guardian of the value" of the dollar? Mr. Singer wants the Fed to ease off the gas pedal and change directions.
"The Fed should state that it has done more than enough, and that fiscal and regulatory policy needs to pick up the responsibility for growth and job creation."
"We should demand that the Fed start commenting -- in their beautiful prose -- on the value of the dollar. They also need to start normalizing interest rates carefully, while developing intelligent policies to deal with the possible resultant decline in many asset prices (possibly balanced by optimism in the increased probability of sound money policies in the future). Until interest rates are normalized, capital will continue to be misallocated throughout the economy, real investment 'risk' will be almost impossible to determine and a firm foundation for solid growth in the American economy cannot be created."
His most bitter medicine is perhaps reserved for Europe, which he chides for propping up Greece -- "a hopelessly insolvent country." Mr. Singer's solution is simple: let Greece fail. He argues that Germany and France can only write so many checks before "elected officials are dragged out of the Reichstag by voters, or until German credit is on the verge of collapse." Although the countries have become the informal lenders of last resort for the continent, Mr. Singer warns that they too are on shaky ground.
"The appropriate course is for Greece (and perhaps others) to have as controlled a default as possible and to exit from the Euro. The 'strong' European countries will then have to ameliorate the severe economic shock which the defaulting countries will suffer, and they will also have to control and limit the damage to their own banking systems which presently hold a significant amount of the 'bad' debt."
So what to make of all the volatility? Mr. Singer shies away from hanging up the Doomsday clock. With a healthy dose of uncertainty, he says he's not sure if the "current market volatility is the start of something big or just a spooky episode." However, if the next financial crisis is indeed brewing, Mr. Singer says, it will not enter as a lamb:
"You should expect surprising transmission mechanisms, the tearing apart of vulnerable market connections and assumptions, and a whole new set of insolvencies and problems. There is no way to predict the shape and timing of it, except our guess is that when the next real crisis (not just a head fake) starts, it will play fast, very fast."
Yet for all the bearish musings in the letter, there is one thing Elliott is bullish on: itself.
The fund said it is still finding significant opportunity in "structured products, readily available at cheap prices from banks that are still under pressure; securities related to distressed real estate in the U.S., Europe and Japan; and discounted claims in the Madoff bankruptcy." 
In defense of its size, Mr. Singer says its returns have not suffered as it has grown. Based on an in-house statistical analysis, the fund achieved its best performance in 2007 and 2009, when it was at its biggest. 
It is also getting bigger. The firm, the letter said, is "currently in the process of raising additional capital."

HEADLINE: Climate Change an Extra Burden for Native Americans, Study Says

BYLINE: JOHN M. BRODER


HIGHLIGHT: Native Americans are particularly at risk because they depend more directly than most other Americans on natural resources and on the bounty of oceans and rivers, a report says.

 BODY:
Because tribal lands are particularly prone to drought, flooding, wildfires and other weather extremes, American Indian tribes suffer disproportionately from the impacts of climate change, a new study from the National Wildlife Federation and other groups reported Wednesday.
American Indians and Alaska natives are more dependent than most other Americans on natural resources and on the bounty of oceans and rivers and thus are particularly at risk from the effects of a warming planet, according to the report, "Facing the Storm: Indian Tribes, Climate-Induced Weather Extremes and the Future for Indian Country." Because many Native Americans live on reservations, they do not have the freedom to move in response to extreme climatic events and are forced to adapt, often with very limited resources.
"The high dependence of tribes upon their lands and natural resources to sustain their economic, cultural and spiritual practices, the relatively poor state of their infrastructure and the great need for financial and technical resources to recover from such events all contribute to the disproportionate impact on tribes," the report states.
The study cites numerous recent extreme weather events, including flooding along the Missouri River, drought in the Southwest, wildfires in Arizona and melting permafrost in Alaska as having particularly damaging effects on the lives and livelihoods of Native Americans.This year has already brought some of the most damaging weather events in United States history, and such extremes are expected to accelerate as carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases accumulate in the atmosphere.
"Extreme weather events can be very destructive for tribes, many of whom are already suffering from lack of resources to begin with," said Amanda Staudt, a scientist at the National Wildlife Federation and a contributor to the report.
Among the study's recommendations are an increase in federal funds for climate adaptation programs on tribal lands; greater exploitation of renewable resources, including solar power, on Indian reservations; and stronger collaboration among tribes on natural resources and climate change programs. The group faulted the Department of Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs for not providing the money needed to help Indians deal with climate impacts they had virtually no part in creating.
Jose Aguto, policy adviser on climate change for the National Congress of American Indians, said that Indians have proved to be highly adaptable over centuries and can draw on that experience in facing the challenges of climate change in coming decades.
"Tribal peoples have lived on the land for centuries and millennia," he said. "These practices have been proven by time."
Other contributors to the report are the Institute for Tribal Environmental Professionals, the National Congress of American Indians, the Native American Fish and Wildlife Society, the National Tribal Environmental Council, the Native American Rights Fund and the University of Colorado Law School.

HEADLINE: Will Oil Consumers Tighten Their Belts?

BYLINE: CLIFFORD KRAUSS


HIGHLIGHT: A Brazilian oil executive predicts that oil demand will be met in coming decades as products get more efficient, cars get lighter, home construction improves and mass transportation gets better.

 BODY:
There's always a lot of concern about energy, especially when very hot weather reminds us of climate change and headlines warn that unrest in the Middle East could drive up oil and gasoline prices again at any moment.
 But Petrobras's chief executive, Jose Sergio Gabrielli de Azevedo, who is in the United States this week talking up his company's new business plan, sees reason for optimism. Petrobras is the growing energy giant in the developing world, and perhaps the single biggest example of Brazil's emergence as a world economic power.
 Brazilians are known to be upbeat, and Mr. Gabrielli de Azevedo is no exception. He sees a "very tight market" for oil in the near term, but over the next 20 years or so, he thinks producers will be able to meet demand. "We are not going to need to end the use of oil," he said. "There is nothing that can give the energy power of oil."
 At first blush, that sounds like what you would expect an oil executive to say and bad news for anyone concerned about the carbon dioxide emissions associated with global warming. But the most optimistic theme in my conversation with Mr. Gabrielli de Axevedo was conservation -- the reason that he believes that new oil production will keep up with the world's needs. 
 "We are going to improve efficiency," he said. "We are going to have lighter cars, we are going to use engines that are going to be more efficient and use less oil, we are going to have better home construction to save energy on heating and air conditioning, we are going to have better transportation mobility systems that can minimize the use of cars with more bus-type of transportation." He said the developing world, where energy demand is increasing more rapidly than in the United States and Europe, could even lead the way. "The biggest growth in solar and wind energy is outside of the developed economies," he said.
 At the conclusion of our conversation, I expressed my surprise at his optimism. 
 "Yes -- otherwise I have to quit my job," Mr. Gabrielli de Axevedo said.

HEADLINE: A Climate Scientist's View of a Famine's Roots

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: A climate scientist lays out the argument for ocean warming underpinning Somali hunger.

 BODY:
Chris Funk, who is in the Climate Hazard Group at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and is affiliated with the U.S. Geological Survey, has a compelling commentary on the roots of the famine in southern Somalia on the Nature Web site under the headline "We Thought Trouble Was Coming" (unfortunately behind the subscription wall).
It describes his research linking a warming Indian Ocean -- when combined with La Nina conditions -- with reductions in crucial rainfall from March to June in East Africa. But more important, it describes the value of the integrated analysis being done by the Famine Early Warning Systems Network, organized by the United States Agency for International Development, to try to cut the chances that a drought like the present one could spawn a famine. If you want to keep track of the drought and food issues in the Horn of Africa, there's no better starting place than this project's East Africa Web page.
Funk's piece asks a vital question: "So what went wrong? Why weren't the warnings - before and during the drought - enough to avert a food crisis that might turn into famine?"
He notes that politics and the lack of governance are prime drivers of the Somali famine. But he also asserts that over-reliance on the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change analysis of impacts in Africa -- which projected more rain in East Africa in a warming world, not less -- lulled some agencies into discounting drought risks there. More recently, the Indian Ocean analysis by Funk and a colleague, A. Park Williams, along with other studies, points to drying -- and a contribution from human-driven global warming.
Funk says the 2007 projection of wetter conditions led some agencies to plan the expansion of agriculture in the region -- plans that could be devastated if drier conditions prevail, as his work implies.
Another problem, he says, is the lack of close-focus climate analysis in the region. This is a longstanding issue that was also emphasized in "The Climate Divide," our 2007 special report in The Times on the outsize vulnerability to climate change in places like sub-Saharan Africa.
Finally, he writes, the combination of rapid population growth and low agricultural productivity in the region has greatly amplified the potential for starvation.
Combine all these elements with the drying linked to recent substantial warming of Indian Ocean waters -- which Funk and other researchers attribute to human-driven global warming -- and you will have more of what's unfolding in Somalia now. Click here for a Google Scholar sift of research on the climate connection.
He says improved climate information, increased agricultural productivity, better storage for grain and water and integrated African markets could boost resilience in the region.
"Better regional climate-change and forecast models, combined with more effective agriculture in drought-threatened areas will not solve all problems, but they should reduce the need for emergency responses, and make such measures more effective when they are necessary," he concludes.
Of course, none of these steps will be of much use for the suffering people of southern Somalia as long as extremist, exploitative warlords rule their lives.

HEADLINE: Facing the Loss of a Home, and a Quirky Experiment

BYLINE: COREY KILGANNON


HIGHLIGHT: A man who turned the Brooklyn house he has owned for decades into a research center for energy conservation owes the city thousands.

 BODY:
These days, there is no shortage of compelling tales of New Yorkers facing foreclosure and battling bureaucracy in a struggle to pay their bills.
Still, the story of Jerome Johnson of Flatbush, Brooklyn, stands out.
Because he owes tens of thousands in overdue property taxes and water bills, Mr. Johnson, 81, may lose his rather unusual home, which he has owned for 50 years. From the outside it looks like some sort of houseboat, and inside it resembles something out of "The Swiss Family Robinson.''
Before there were "green buildings," there was Mr. Johnson's house, which he called one of the city's earliest solar-conscious homes. In 1979, he opened it as a research center, naming it the Johnson Energy Clinic and Cooperative.
"This place is a museum," he said, walking through the house on Monday. "It was the city's first three-dimensional research facility - not a bunch of talk - for conservation and retrofitting a house to harness solar energy."
The place is a testament to Mr. Johnson's innovative spirit and do-it-yourself approach. There are skylights made from plastic lids taken from stereo turntables. Reflective wallpaper on the ceiling refracts heat from electric lights, he said. There is no running water, and rainwater is collected from rooftop basins.
But for all of Mr. Johnson's talent at tapping into the power of natural energy, he has fallen out of harmony with the powers that be.
He owes nearly $21,000 in unpaid property taxes and about $31,000 in water bills. Faced with losing the property, he said on Tuesday that he hoped to pay off the tax bill.
But Mr. Johnson, who lives on $650 a month in Social Security, challenged the water bill, arguing that his house has not drawn a drop of water from the city's supply in nearly 30 years and does not have a water meter.
Mr. Johnson and his wife, Jacqueline - they divorced around 1970 - bought the two-story house in 1961 for $8,000. After the divorce, Mrs. Johnson stayed in the house, but in 1978 she moved out with their three children as crime became more prevalent in the neighborhood.
It was the following year that Mr. Johnson, inspired by the energy crisis, set up the research center. High school and college students and government officials were invited to discuss conservation. The water was shut off in 1982, Mr. Johnson said, and the lack of running water was central to using the house as a model of energy conservation.
Mr. Johnson installed wall-sized windows, using seat-of-the-pants engineering and architectural techniques, but he received citations from the Department of Buildings for not having the proper permits.
Starting in the 1950s, Mr. Johnson designed, manufactured and sold photography lighting equipment from a shop that he ran for years in Times Square. His innovations included products like the Reflectal, an umbrellalike device that diffuses light. In the 1970s his inventions turned toward energy conservation and contraptions that harnessed solar power.
"I'm basically an inventor, but if you tell people that, you're crazy," he said, sitting in his front yard, which is filled with plants and a shopping cart stuffed with compost.
He tweaked his Reflectal design and devised the umbrella food cooker, whose silver cover reflects heat onto a central grill.
"That's my Para-Broiler," he said, pointing to a umbrella with a wire grill where the handle would be. "You put that in the sun right now and you could cook a hamburger or hot dog with it in 45 minutes."
"We only made a sample run of them - sold about 10," he said.
He stepped onto his glassed-in front porch, which can be heated by a small wood-burning stove made from an old propane tank - another Jerry Johnson prototype. There were many more examples of his work inside.
There was a battery-powered skateboard made for his grandson; a solar-powered oven, complete with water-purification system, made but never marketed for use in poor countries; and a series of models on how to build a geodesic home. There were also countless binders filled with handwritten treatises on conservation methods.
Skylights in the roof of the house help heat the air, which is blown by a fan to other rooms. Rainwater collected from the roof drips through pipes to 100-gallon tubs in the basement.
Mr. Johnson, a vegetarian, does his limited cooking on a hot plate. He uses no gas or oil. He does not have a water heater, but if he needs to take a sponge bath, he can warm up his water by running it through a rooftop convection system made of hundreds of old tuna cans that are heated by the sun.
Mr. Johnson has water bills showing that the city has been billing him for almost 250 gallons of water a day. An official at the city's Department of Environmental Protection said that since Mr. Johnson rejected the city's attempts to install a water meter, he was billed at a rate based upon previous usage and the size of his home.
He has been charged a minimum annual fee for using the city's sewage system and being connected to the water supply, and he has accumulated many years of interest and fines for nonpayment.
Mr. Johnson said that the city bungled his application for a Senior Citizen Homeowners' Exemption, which could reduce his annual tax bill and quite likely prevent foreclosure. He said he still hoped to pay his taxes.
"You can see I don't give up," he said.

HEADLINE: Q. and A.: What's So Funny in Brazil?

BYLINE: LARRY ROHTER


HIGHLIGHT: Alvaro Paes de Barros, the general manager for Viacom in Brazil, who is supervising the opening of the Comedy Central network there, talks about the comedian Rafinha Bastos and the rise of Brazilian comedy.

 BODY:
The Brazilian comedian Rafinha Bastos, recently named the most influential person in the Twitter universe, is spearheading a comedy explosion in his home country. He is part of "a new generation of humorists out there who are acid, vibrant and clever," said Alvaro Paes de Barros, the general manager for Viacom in Brazil, who is supervising the opening of Comedy Central there. 
From its beginnings in the United States, Comedy Central has expanded to become a global presence, with channels in countries ranging from Britain and Poland to Israel and New Zealand. But Brazil will be the largest overseas market (200 million people) it has entered and the network's first venture in Latin America. 
Mr. Paes de Barros, 39, spoke with The New York Times about the new generation of comedians that Mr. Bastos leads and cultural gulfs in humor and how to overcome them. Here are excerpts from that conversation: 
Q.
 Do American styles of humor automatically translate to a society like Brazil?
A.
 I don't think so. That's why this channel is going to have a mix, with American and other international product, but also a lot of locally made programming. I can't say yet what the percentage will be, but it's clear that we are a country that, while it looks to the U.S. a lot, is also proud of its own culture. So we have to find a balance between the two. 
Q.
 But you are planning to have both stand-up sessions from the U.S. and the network's two signature shows there, "The Daily Show With Jon Stewart" and "The Colbert Report"
A.
 Yes, both of those and series like "South Park" and "Ugly Americans" too. They will be subtitled rather than dubbed. The idea is to get everything on the air as quickly as possible, before the joke loses its humor. But we're also going to be hiring some very funny Brazilian writers and editors, some of them famous and some not. We're talking to a lot of people because it's our sense of things that comedy is turning into an industry here.
Q.
 MTV Brasil has been very successful, but what made Viacom think that it made sense to bring the Comedy Central brand to Brazil? 
A.
 Well, there's a real boom in humor going on here. It's very fashionable, and there's a new generation of comedians who are very sharp and savvy. Plus, the economy is booming, and the market for cable TV is also growing vigorously. So when you add all of that up, and look at our portfolio, we decided that it made good sense to launch Comedy Central here. It's an idea whose time has come.
Q.
 How would you characterize this new crop of Brazilian comedians?
A.
 They're a very irreverent group, and fearless. They're not afraid to do social criticism and commentary. Really, they are quite gutsy. And they're very politicized, with their antennae out for the way politics is done here in Brazil, the idiosyncrasies of our particular system. Politics is like a high-octane fuel for comedy. The other thing about this group is that they don't do humor in the traditional way, with sketches or stock phrases. They're focused on stand-up, which is something new for Brazil, and are always dealing with current themes, easily identifiable by the audience.
Q.
 When did this comedy boom that you're talking about actually start?
A.
 It's hard to say, but if you want me to pick a point in time, I'd say that it truly started to gain force starting around 2008. For us at Viacom, we've been thinking of this for about a year and a half, and we've done the research that tells us there's an audience for this. It's young, in the age range 24 to 35; it's urban; and it's predominantly male.
Q.
 What makes you think that particular Brazilian audience is going to be receptive to the American programming that you're going to be offering?
A.
 Among other things, the example of shows like "Seinfeld" and "Friends." Those are programs that initially were directed at one particular market or culture, but appeal to an urban, globalized viewing public that has access to cable TV. It's the same thing with "South Park," which has been shown on some other cable channels here. The themes are American, but that young and globalized audience understands what you're talking about and finds the satire to be very humorous.
Q.
 What was your reaction when Rafinha Bastos was designated the most influential person in the Twitter universe
A.
 I didn't know he had that many followers, but I was impressed. He's someone who started out on the Internet and ends up being mainstream. I don't know him personally, but he's been very astute in using these tools, which are available to everyone. They weren't there just for him, and he's really been brilliant in using them. It just goes to show the power of this particular group of comedians. They really operate on a high level -- they're intelligent and perceptive, and I think they are really going to go far. 
I would also add that his ranking confirms the validity of our own approach. There are lessons for all of us about using new and more democratic platforms for people to express themselves. In our case, we see Comedy Central as both a channel and a multimedia platform. When it launches early next year, it's going to have standard and HD, simulcasts, content for the Internet and cellphones and applications. There's a public out there that's really connected, and we want to engage them with all kinds of content on all kinds of platforms.

HEADLINE: Is Dodd-Frank Overdue or Overkill? Senate Hears Dueling Views

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Joseph E. Stiglitz, the Nobel-winning economist, contends Dodd-Frank does not go far enough. Eugene A. Ludwig, a former top financial regulator, warns of "a deleterious drag on capital formation."

 BODY:
Will the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory overhaul thwart a future crisis?
That depends on who you ask.
"While the Dodd-Frank bill improved matters, it went nowhere far enough: the problems continue, and as long as they continue, our economy is at risk," Joseph E. Stiglitz, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, told the Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday. 
Conversely, a former top financial regulator testifying at the Senate hearing cautioned that the law bordered on overkill. Eugene A. Ludwig, the former comptroller of the currency during the Clinton administration, praised portions of the Dodd-Frank Act while warning that it could put "a deleterious drag on capital formation and meaningful job opportunities for our people."
"Like any strong medicine," he said, "if applied incorrectly or excessively, the DoddFrank Act can produce more harm than good."
The debate at the hearing reflected larger partisan wrangling over the law, enacted in response to the financial crisis. 
Democrats largely back Dodd-Frank, saying Wall Street was long overdue for a crackdown. Republicans counter that the law will crimp the banking industry's profit-making engines at a fragile time for the American economy. Conservative lawmakers in the House of Representatives have introduced some two-dozen measures to kill or roll back the law. 
Spanning more than 2,000 pages, Dodd-Frank touches on areas like the $600 trillion derivatives market and weak loan underwriting standards that fed the mortgage bubble. 
But as regulators put the finishing touches on some 300 new rules under Dodd-Frank, tough new capital requirements have emerged as one of the thorniest provisions in the vast new law. 
Under Dodd-Frank, a council of regulators must designate the financial firms - including mutual funds, insurance companies and hedge funds - that pose a systemic risk to the financial system. These firms, and the so-called too-big-to-fail banks like JPMorgan Chase that have more than $50 billion in assets, will face higher capital requirements and broader federal oversight. 
"In the aftermath of the crisis, the banking sector has become more concentrated, and the risk posed by too-big-to-fail banks has, if anything increased," Mr. Stiglitz said.
Banks loathe the thought of tougher capital requirements, calling it a "surcharge." The banks note that the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is already ramping up its own international capital standards. 
"We now have very tough capital requirements and capital levels that significantly exceed previous requirements," Mr. Ludwig, who is now chief executive of the financial advisory firm Promontory Financial Group, said in prepared testimony. "At the end of the day, capital is an important tool in the supervisory toolbox, but it is only one tool. He went on to advise against "any further increases incapital requirements beyond the tough new Basel rules."
Mr. Stiglitz, however, called on regulators to cut the big banks down to size. 
"Excessive leverage has large societal costs," he said in prepared testimony. "Banks, and especially the big banks, need to be restrained."

HEADLINE: State Panel to Review Pay of Leaders at Nonprofits

BYLINE: RUSS BUETTNER


HIGHLIGHT: Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced the creation of a task force to investigate executive compensation at nonprofit organizations that receive subsidies from the state. 

 BODY:
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced on Wednesday the creation of a task force to investigate executive compensation at nonprofit organizations that receive taxpayer subsidies from the state.
The governor said the organizations had "a special obligation to the taxpayers that support them."
"Executives at these not-for-profits should be using the taxpayer dollars they receive to help New Yorkers, not to line their own pockets," Mr. Cuomo said.
An article in The New York Times on Tuesday highlighted salaries at nonprofit organizations that provide Medicaid-financed services to developmentally disabled New Yorkers. It focused on two brothers and the agency they had led since the 1970s, the Young Adult Institute. 
The brothers, Philip and Joel Levy, received close to $1 million a year each at the peak of their earnings. As part of their compensation, the brothers and other executives were allowed to bill the institute for the costs of their children's college educations.
Philip Levy also charged the organization $50,400 for his daughter's living expenses one year, money that went toward her purchase of a co-op apartment in Greenwich Village. Both brothers retired abruptly at the end of June.
The article in The Times appeared with a list of executives of other providers of Medicaid-financed services to developmentally disabled people who were paid more than $500,000, most considerably above the average chief executive salary for similarly sized nonprofit groups in the state.
Mr. Cuomo's announcement called the salaries reported in the article "startlingly excessive."
"There is a whole range of compensation levels and extremes that have existed for too long and must be reviewed," he said in the announcement.
There are no state rules governing executive or administrative compensation at groups that receive state subsidies. The task force will audit current compensation levels and recommend rules to ensure that money is not wasted on "excessive salaries and compensation," the announcement said.
The task force will be led by the New York State inspector general, Ellen N. Biben; Secretary of State Cesar A. Perales; the state Medicaid inspector general, James C. Cox; and the superintendent of the Department of Financial Services, Benjamin M. Lawsky.
The nonprofit groups may lobby against efforts to regulate compensation.
Doug Sauer, chief executive of the New York Council of Nonprofits, suggested that the governor's task force should also examine the compensation of executives at for-profit companies working under state contracts in other areas of government.
Mr. Sauer said that he supported efforts to root out cases in which "charitable resources are used for the private and personal gain of executives," but that such cases were rare and subject to existing Internal Revenue Service guidelines.

HEADLINE: Can the Debt Ceiling Genie Be Put Back in the Bottle?

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Can anything be done to prevent the debt ceiling from becoming a legislative ping-pong ball?

 BODY:
If there was any doubt that Washington's acrimonious debt fight created a new political reality, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky dashed it on Tuesday.
The very real threat of forcing the nation into a first-ever financial default -- along with the potential for economic calamity -- will forever be a powerful tool used by lawmakers and presidents alike, the Senate's top Republican predicted.
"Never again will any president, from either party, be allowed to raise the debt ceiling without being held accountable for it by the American people and without having to engage in the kind of debate we've just come through," Mr. McConnell said moments before the Senate vote on the deal he worked out to raise the debt ceiling by $2.1 trillion.
President Obama had argued repeatedly during the last several weeks that holding up a debt ceiling increase amid partisan political bickering was the equivalent of a hostage-taking, with the global economy at stake.
"The debt ceiling should not be something that is used as a gun against the heads of the American people," the president said.
But Mr. McConnell sees it differently. By his way of thinking, the risk of default was a clarifying kind of moment for lawmakers, who too often refuse to tackle hard problems. (Mr. Obama is often known to agree that lawmakers are too apt to "kick the can down the road" rather than confront difficult issues.)
Mr. McConnell said the just-ended debate in Washington created "an entirely new template" for future attempts to raise the debt ceiling.
"This kind of discussion isn't something to dread; it's something to welcome," Mr. McConnell said. "And while the president may not have particularly enjoyed this debate, it was a debate that Washington needed to have."
Thanks to the legislation that Mr. McConnell and Mr. Obama helped to negotiate, there won't be another such debate during the president's current term. The $2.1 trillion boost in the debt ceiling should make another increase unnecessary until March of 2013, officials said.
But in the long term, it may be impossible for Washington to put the debt ceiling genie back in the bottle.
Why? Because in the end, hostage-taking works.
Future Republicans will no doubt look back on the debt ceiling fight of 2011 as a success. Whether conservative members got everything they wanted or not, it is hard to argue that they did not get more than they would have without the threat of holding up the debt ceiling increase.
"We've had to settle for less than we wanted, but what we've achieved is in no way insignificant," Mr. McConnell said after the vote.
But it's not only Republican members of Congress who might take advantage of the debt ceiling. 
Given the proven power of the issue, it is not hard to imagine a future in which a Democratic minority finds it in their interests to advance a top priority by threatening to hold up a debt ceiling increase for a Republican president.
That would seem rather hypocritical for current Democrats, who all accused their Republican counterparts of playing fast and loose with the American economy. But politicians rarely worry too much about hypocrisy. And given enough time, political realities shift.
Could something be done to avoid such a future, where the debt ceiling is a legislative ping-pong ball? 
It is true that members of the current Congress cannot bind the actions of a future Congress. So any legislative rule that lawmakers would pass today -- even if such a rule could pass -- would be subject to being overturned by future members of Congress.
That leaves the possibility of a constitutional fix.
Democratic lawmakers repeatedly argued over the last several weeks that a little-studied section of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution gave Mr. Obama (and future presidents) the authority to simply raise the debt ceiling without waiting for Congress to act.
"The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payments of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion shall not be questioned," the section reads.
An executive order by Mr. Obama could seek to clarify that section, perhaps written to apply only to future presidents to avoid the impression of a power grab. That might lessen the ability of future Congresses to play games of chicken over the debt ceiling.
Such an order could be overturned, but sitting presidents rarely like giving up power to the Legislature.
Finally, of course, Mr. Obama and his Democratic allies (or even like-minded Republicans) could seek to amend the Constitution to explicitly give the president the power to raise the debt ceiling without the Congress.
That seems highly unlikely given Mr. McConnell's views, which appear to be shared widely in the Republican Party. A constitutional amendment would require approval by two-thirds of the members in each House and then approval by three-fourths of the state legislatures.
Could that be part of a grand constitutional bargain in which the president gets the unquestioned authority to raise the debt ceiling in exchange for a balanced budget amendment sought by Republicans? Given the difficulty that the parties had reaching a "grand bargain" on a 10-year spending plan, that seems rather far-fetched.
In his remarks on the Senate floor on Tuesday, Mr. McConnell quoted Winston Churchill as saying that, "Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; [and] courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen."
It helps to have a debt ceiling, too.

HIGHLIGHT: Highlights from the DealBook newsletter.

 BODY:
Former Directors of Failed Firms Have Little to Fear | A look at how onetime Enron directors have fared in recent years suggests that directors of institutions that collapsed during the financial crisis have little to fear. In fact, the Enron example indicates that the former directors of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers will likely continue their prominent careers.
While top corporate Enron executives went to prison, the company's former directors remain unscathed. Four former Enron directors still serve on public boards. Frank Savage, for example, heads his own investment firm and serves on the boards of Bloomberg L.P. and Lockheed Martin. Others have gone back to or entered academia, including Wendy Gramm, the wife of a former senator, Phil Gramm.

HEADLINE: California Air Resources Board Sees 'Reasonable Compromise' in CAFE Standards

BYLINE: JIM WITKIN


HIGHLIGHT: The board, which sets emissions standards for light-duty vehicles in the state, does not anticipate that automakers would have to comply with both a federal and a California standard.

 BODY:
Proposed fuel economy standards for 2017-25 model-year vehicles, announced last week by President Obama, should reduce greenhouse gas emissions at a pace consistent with targets set by the California Air Resources Board, according to agency representatives.
The board plans to announce its clean-air targets in September, said Tom Cackette, its chief deputy executive officer, in a telephone interview. If these standards are signed into law next summer, automakers can expect to be exempted from having to comply with separate California emissions standards, he confirmed.
This should come as welcome news for automakers and industry groups that have worried about the possibility of complying with separate emission rules, one from the federal government and another from California, the only state granted the authority to set its own air quality regulations under the Clean Air Act.
Increasing fleet fuel economy to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025, as President Obama proposed last week, will reduce greenhouse gas emissions from light duty vehicles to 163 grams per mile, according to the government's calculations.
"We've said all along that we wanted to see a 3 to 6 percent annual improvement in emissions for the fleet from 2016 levels, so the 163 level ends up being a little less than 5 percent, which we think is a reasonable compromise," Mr. Cackette said. He was referring to the current corporate standard, which covers 2012-16 model-year vehicles.
At the federal level, the Environmental Protection Agency has authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, while the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration sets fuel economy standards. Yet given the close link between emissions and fuel economy, Mr. Cackette said that the state worked closely with these federal agencies in the proposals announced last week.
In September, the board's proposal for greenhouse gas emissions will be followed by a rulemaking period during which public comments will be accepted. After this review and any modification made by board members, the proposals will be signed into state law. The federal agencies will go through a similar but longer rulemaking period, which is expected to conclude in the summer of 2012.
Though much can happen over a year, Mr. Cackette does not expect any significant deviations from the federal fuel economy proposals announced last week, provided the final federal rules allow California to achieve its emissions reduction targets through 2025.
"We would develop a provision for automakers allowing the federal standards to account for ours," he said. "We know that's what the car companies want."

HEADLINE: Private Donors, Including Mayor, Save January Regents

BYLINE: SHARON OTTERMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Mr. Bloomberg made a few key calls and, throwing in some of his own money, raised enough to restore the Regents exams that are administered in January.

 BODY:
Over the last several weeks, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg made a series of unusual fund-raising calls to a handful of wealthy New Yorkers. Would they be willing, he asked, to chip in $250,000 each to save some standardized tests?
The state, he told them, had canceled the January administration of the high school Regents exams, endangering the graduation of thousands of city students. Principals were warning of disastrous consequences and more dropouts. To reinstate the exams for next year, the state needed $1.4 million the State Legislature did not provide.
He placed five calls, and all of the donors said yes. Mr. Bloomberg then pitched in $250,000 from his own private philanthropy. So now January exams are back on across the state in what may be the nation's first private effort to pay for standardized testing. 
"They are not trying to court favor with anybody," he said on Wednesday, announcing the gift and explaining why all the donors, with the exception of the mayor, were anonymous. "They just understand that this is the future of our country, our kids, the future of our city."
Principals use the January administration of the Regents for many reasons: practice for students, early graduation, and a second or third chance for students who failed the test before. To graduate, students across the state have to pass Regents exams in five subjects - math, English, science, American history and global history.
After the state canceled the January tests in May, city principals wrote letters to state officials, warned the schools chancellor about plummeting graduation rates and wrote opinion articles in local newspapers. But even the principals most involved in the issue did not know until Wednesday morning that the mayor had started a private fund-raising effort.
"I am very pleased and relieved," said Sarah Scrogin, the principal of East Bronx Academy for the Future, explaining how the January tests last year helped get one of her students, who had given birth in the ninth grade, back on track.
Because the state was $8 million short in its testing budget for next year, it also canceled all foreign language Regents exams, leading to concerns that high schools will now cut classes in those subjects to save money. But because those tests are optional for graduation, the mayor put his foot down when asked if he would make a few calls to save them, too.
"The private sector cannot fill in for the state on everything, nor will we do that," he said. "This is a one-time shot, a chance to save kids."

HEADLINE: Huntsman Steps Up Critiques of Rivals

BYLINE: SHERYL GAY STOLBERG


HIGHLIGHT: Once declining to attack his rivals, Jon M. Huntsman Jr. criticized both President Obama and Mitt Romney for their handling of the debt ceiling fight as he toured New Hampshire.

 BODY:
MANCHESTER, N.H. - Perhaps it was a measure of Jon M. Huntsman Jr.'s struggles in his race for the Republican presidential nomination that when he arrived here for a meeting with Mayor Ted Gatsas, it was the mayor who showed up late.
"Oh well," Mr. Gatsas said with a slightly sheepish shrug, after pulling up his white Mercedes-Benz in his City Hall parking spot, seemingly in a big hurry.
But on the bright side for Mr. Huntsman, who is spending the week here in an effort to gin up some enthusiasm for his nascent campaign, people did seem eager to see him. Once the mayor's promised tour of downtown businesses got underway, several people pledged to vote for Mr. Huntsman. (Some turned out to be Democrats, but the candidate didn't seem to mind. "You've got to get votes to win,'' Mr. Huntsman said, "and the primary in this state is open, last I saw.")
Mr. Huntsman, the former Utah governor who crossed party lines to serve as President Obama's ambassador to China, has worked to cultivate a reputation as "the civility candidate" on the campaign trail for his refusal to attack his opponents. But this week, with his poll numbers stuck in the single digits, he has been stepping up his rhetoric, first against the Republican front-runner in many polls, Mitt Romney, and Wednesday against President Obama.
 On Tuesday, he said his Republican rivals had shown "very little leadership" in the debt-ceiling fight in Washington, and singled out Mr. Romney for not making his views known until the last minute. The silence was "telling," Mr. Huntsman said. Here in Manchester, Mr. Huntsman took aim at the president he once served, saying he had seen nothing from Mr. Obama that addressed the concerns about the economy and jobs.
"There has been nothing in the last two and a half years that has spoken to the most important issue of our time, and that's expanding the economy and creating jobs," he said. Asked if he meant nothing from Mr. Obama, he said, "Well, we do have the health care reform, which is one trillion in added costs."
Mr. Huntsman, who calls himself a "conservative problem solver," is emphasizing his record creating jobs in Utah. He is more moderate than his Republican competitors, and he does not intend to compete in Iowa, a far more conservative state than New Hampshire. Further evidence of that came early this week, when he stood alone among the Republican presidential contenders in praising the debt ceiling deal - comments he echoed here on Wednesday as he strolled along Elm Street, the city's main thoroughfare, for some old-style shoe-leather politicking.
He stopped in pizza joints (including one that the mayor claimed served ketchup-mustard pizza, which Mr. Huntsman said might go well with jalapeno peppers), a Hungarian pastry shop, a U.P.S. office, a Ben & Jerry's ice cream shop (he ordered a cup of Cherry Garcia) and a music store.
At the last stop, Mr. Huntsman could not resist. He is an expert keyboardist who in his younger days quit high school to join a rock and roll band. It took only mild coaxing to get him to play a bit; he broke into the theme song from Charlie Brown. (Nobody pulled the football away.) And he let his humor show during a visit to a hair salon, where a massage therapist volunteered that she could do "Thai massage, Swedish massage, pregnancy massage."
"How about campaign?'' Mr. Huntsman asked.
"Campaign massages," the woman replied. "Yeah, we could do campaign massages."
Some voters had clearly never heard of him. "Who? one asked. Nonetheless, Mr. Huntsman expressed optimism at the end of his hour-long walk around town that things were looking up for his campaign. More and more people are coming to his events, he said, and he made the case that the race will not really begin until Sept. 1. He said he was not paying attention to poll numbers, and vowed to "get to know everybody in this state."
On that score, he may have some work to do. When his campaign sent out a mailer to New Hampshire voters this week, it misspelled his first name, inserting an extra H to make it John. Mr. Huntsman, the son of a billionaire industrialist whose name he bears, tried to laugh it off.
"Well I come from a long line of illiterates,'' he said. "They forgot to put the H in my name, and sometimes it comes back to haunt me.''

HEADLINE: The Truth About Fundamentals

BYLINE: FLOYD NORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: A fundamental law about economic fundamentals.

 BODY:
Herewith I offer a fundamental law about fundamentals:
As you may recall, we heard a lot about fundamentals when the American economy was sliding into recession in 2007 and early 2008. But the immediate impetus for formulating the law comes from Rachel Donadio's article on Wednesday:
ROME - As markets continued to hammer Italy, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi on Wednesday rebutted calls for his resignation, saying Italy's economic fundamentals were strong and pledging that his government was "up to the task" of fostering economic growth.
Mr. Berlusconi went on to declare: "Our economy is healthy. The country is economically and financially solid."

HEADLINE: More Evidence That Supply Matters

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: Advocates of fiscal stimulus keep insisting that supply doesn't matter, and they're wrong, an economist writes.

 BODY:
 
The supply of various types of workers has increased during the recession, continuing an earlier trend. That such trends continue to be associated with trends for employment contradicts the Keynesian claim that supply suddenly stops mattering during recessions and "liquidity traps."
A number of bloggers have pointed out that employment in Texas has been rising and has almost reached prerecession levels. Paul Krugman's explanation is that the supply of people available and willing to work has been increasing in Texas, continuing a previous trend.
One example of that supply is the inflow of immigrants from nearby Mexico; another is the migration of Americans seeking cheaper housing. I might quibble about the details, but I agree that supply trends are crucial for understanding what has happened in Texas.
In previous posts I have pointed out that national employment per capita actually increased among the elderly during the recession. I, and other researchers, concluded that elderly employment deviated so much from the general population because of changes in elderly labor supply. 
In reaction to my post, Dean Baker attributed the elderly increase during the recession to a previous trend. Because the previous trend was itself the result of supply, Dr. Baker's explanation of the recession is essentially a supply increase, too.So we all agree that in at least two cases labor supply increased during the recession, and in each case the result was more jobs for the affected groups, or at least fewer job losses than in the general population.
Recession-era supply episodes like these are important to identify, because they can prove or reject Keynesians' fundamental assertion (so far unproven) that supply does not matter during a recession or a "liquidity trap" such as we've experienced since the recession began.
Consider, hypothetically, an immigration trend that continued even after the recession. In my view, the market would create jobs for many, but not all, of the immigrants and would continue to do so after the recession. 
In the Keynesian view, immigration might create jobs before the recession, but could not create them once the recession began because "what's limiting employment now is lack of demand for the things workers produce," Professor Krugman wrote. "Their incentives to seek work are, for now, irrelevant." 
In the Keynesian view, all that extra supply does during the recession is add to unemployment rather than adding to employment. In other words, supply trends normally affect employment, but Keynesians assert that they cease to affect employment during a recession or liquidity trap.
The chart below shows monthly employment (left scale) and unemployment (right scale) in Texas since 2007. Despite the fact that our nation is in a liquidity trap (near-zero interest rates on Treasury bills, the results of the extra supply in Texas since 2009 have been to increase employment much more than increase unemployment.
Or consider that more recent cohorts have found themselves in careers that involve less manual labor, producing a increasing number of people reaching age 65 and still willing and able to continue their work. In my view, elderly employment would rise and might even be rising enough to more than offset a demand reduction during a recession. 
In the Keynesian view, all that extra supply does during the recession is add to unemployment rather than adding to employment.
When it comes to analyzing specific events during the recession, fiscal stimulus advocates often take the common sense approach that labor supply affects employment. But when it comes to making promises about the anticipated results of a large fiscal stimulus, they insist, without proof, that supply doesn't matter.

HEADLINE: Even Marked Up, Luxury Goods Fly Off Shelves

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
Nordstrom has a waiting list for a Chanel sequined tweed coat with a $9,010 price. Neiman Marcus has sold out in almost every size of Christian Louboutin ''Bianca'' platform pumps, at $775 a pair. Mercedes-Benz said it sold more cars last month in the United States than it had in any July in five years.
Even with the economy in a funk and many Americans pulling back on spending, the rich are again buying designer clothing, luxury cars and about anything that catches their fancy. Luxury goods stores, which fared much worse than other retailers in the recession, are more than recovering -- they are zooming. Many high-end businesses are even able to mark up, rather than discount, items to attract customers who equate quality with price.
''If a designer shoe goes up from $800 to $860, who notices?'' said Arnold Aronson, managing director of retail strategies at the consulting firm Kurt Salmon, and the former chairman and chief executive of Saks. 
The rich do not spend quite as they did in the free-wheeling period before the recession, but they are closer to that level.
The luxury category has posted 10 consecutive months of sales increases compared with the year earlier, even as overall consumer spending on categories like furniture and electronics has been tepid, according to the research service MasterCard Advisors SpendingPulse. In July, the luxury segment had an 11.6 percent increase, the biggest monthly gain in more than a year.
What changed? Mostly, the stock market, retailers and analysts said, as well as a good bit of shopping psychology. Even with the sharp drop in stocks over the last week, the Dow Jones is up about 80 percent from its low in March 2009. And with the overall economy nowhere near its recession lows, buying nice, expensive things is back in vogue for people who can afford it.
''Our business is fairly closely tied to how the market performs,'' said Karen W. Katz, the president and chief executive of Neiman Marcus Group. ''Though there are bumps based on different economic data, it's generally been trending in a positive direction.''
Caroline Limpert, 31, an entrepreneur in New York, says she is happy to spend on classic pieces, like the Yves Saint Laurent tote she has in both chocolate and black, but since the recession, she avoids conspicuous items.
''Over all, you want to wear less branded items,'' she said. ''If you have the wherewithal to spend, you never want to be showy about it.'' Still, she said, she is quick to buy at the beginning of each season. ''I buy things that could sell out.''
The recent earnings reports of some luxury goods retailers and automobile companies show just how much the high-end shopper has been willing to spend again.
Tiffany's first-quarter sales were up 20 percent to $761 million. Last week LVMH, which owns expensive brands like Louis Vuitton and Givenchy, reported sales growth in the first half of 2011 of 13 percent to 10.3 billion euros, or $14.9 billion. Also last week, PPR, home to Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent and other brands, said its luxury segment's sales gained 23 percent in the first half. Profits are also up by double digits for many of these companies.
BMW this week said it more than doubled its quarterly profit from a year ago as sales rose 16.5 percent; Porsche said its first-half profit rose 59 percent; and Mercedes-Benz said July sales of its high-end S-Class sedans -- some of which cost more than $200,000 -- jumped nearly 14 percent in the United States.
The success luxury retailers are having in selling $250 Ermenegildo Zegna ties and $2,800 David Yurman pave rings -- the kind encircled with small precious stones -- stands in stark contrast to the retailers who cater to more average Americans.
Apparel stores are holding near fire sales to get people to spend. Wal-Mart is selling smaller packages because some shoppers do not have enough cash on hand to afford multipacks of toilet paper. Retailers from Victoria's Secret to the Children's Place are nudging prices up by just pennies, worried they will lose customers if they do anything more.
While the free spending of the affluent may not be of much comfort to people who are out of jobs or out of cash, the rich may contribute disproportionately to the overall economic recovery.
''This group is key because the top 5 percent of income earners accounts for about one-third of spending, and the top 20 percent accounts for close to 60 percent of spending,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics. ''That was key to why we suffered such a bad recession -- their spending fell very sharply.''
Just a few years ago, luxury retailers were suffering. Too many items were chasing too few buyers, and high-end stores began cutting prices. As a result, consumers awaited 70 percent discounts rather than buying right away. Sales of luxury goods fell 17.9 percent in October 2008 from a year earlier, SpendingPulse said, and double-digit declines continued through May 2009.
Now, many stores are stocking up on luxury items, as shoppers flock to racks of expensive goods.
''They're buying the special pieces, whether it's the exotic leathers, the more fashion-forward pieces,'' said Stephen I. Sadove, the chairman and chief executive of Saks Fifth Avenue. ''There's a dramatic decline in the amount of promotions in the luxury sector -- we're seeing higher levels of full-priced selling than we saw prerecession.''
In 2008, for example, the most expensive Louboutin item that Saks sold was a $1,575 pair of suede boots. Now, it is a $2,495 pair of suede boots that are thigh-high. Creme de la Mer, the facial cream, cost $1,350 for 16 ounces at Bergdorf Goodman in 2008; it now costs $1,650.
''I think that she's willing to pay whatever price the manufacturer and the retailer deem appropriate, if she sees that there's intrinsic value in it,'' Mr. Katz said.
Part of the demand is also driven by the snob factor: at luxury stores, higher prices are often considered a mark of quality.
''You just can't buy a pair of shoes for less than $1,000 in some of the luxury brands, and some of the price points have gone to $2,000,'' said Jyothi Rao, general manager for the women's business at Gilt Groupe, a Web site that sells designer brands at a discount. ''There's absolutely a customer for it.''
Jennifer Margolin, a personal shopper in San Francisco, said she had noticed changes in clients' attitudes. They ''pay full price if they absolutely love it,'' she said. ''Before it was almost completely shying away, where now it's like, 'O.K., I'm comfortable getting a Goyard bag,' but they get it for the quality.''
Goyard bags, in addition to having a distinctive pattern, will usually run a few thousand dollars. And, yes, they are selling out quickly.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 5, 2011

 CORRECTION:
A picture caption on Thursday with an article about a recent increase in the sale of luxury goods misidentified the brand of shoes that a shopper, Lissette Gutierrez, planned to try on at Bergdorf Goodman in Manhattan. The $1,495 shoes are Christian Louboutin, not Louis Vuitton. And the article referred incorrectly at one point to the president and chief executive of Neiman Marcus Group, who commented on the trend in luxury goods. The executive, Karen W. Katz, is a woman.

HEADLINE: Japan Buys Dollars to Weaken the Surging Yen

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Japan said Thursday that it had intervened in the foreign exchange market, selling yen and buying dollars in a bid to reverse a punishing spike in the value of the Japanese currency. 
Japan has been desperate to bulwark its fragile recovery from the March earthquake and tsunami. But even as companies have raced to repair damaged factories and resume production, they have been hit by a surge in the yen that threatens their business overseas.
A strong yen hurts Japan's export-led economy by making its cars and electronics more expensive overseas, and by eroding the value of overseas earnings when converted into yen.
But the Japanese currency, long considered a safe haven, rose as investors wary of the debt impasse in the United States fled to other currencies. Against the dollar, the yen has surged about 11 percent in the last year, and 4 percent in the last month.
The rise has accelerated an upward trend in the yen that was already squeezing Japanese exporters' profits. Toyota, Honda and Nissan all recently blamed their sharply lower earnings in the latest quarter in part on the strong yen.
Still, the effect of moves to manipulate foreign exchange markets, especially by a single country, has often been short-lived. Japan acted alone in the intervention on Thursday morning, though Tokyo is in touch with other countries over the maneuver, Yoshihiko Noda, its finance minister, told reporters. He also said he hoped that the Bank of Japan would take steps to support the government's move.
The Bank of Japan, which has had a sometimes troubled relationship with the government, appeared to support the intervention. The central bank said Thursday morning it would end its regular policy meeting a day early, a sign it could announce additional policy to support the government's bid to weaken the yen.
In a note to clients, Masaaki Kanno, an economist at JPMorgan Securities, said he expected the bank to announce a further easing of Japan's monetary policy by extending an asset purchase program that would increase the bank's reserves, increasing liquidity and helping to dilute the value of the yen.

ECONOMIC MANIFESTO Paul Singer, below, founder of the $17 billion hedge fund Elliott Management, criticized the economic environment in his latest letter to investors, a 14,000-word screed that attacks government officials in the United States and Europe for their fiscal recklessness and portends an end to American hegemony should the ship not soon be righted.

FEEDER SCHOOL Dartmouth College has long been a prime recruiting spot for some of Wall Street's biggest firms. But one undergraduate is fighting back.
In an op-ed column in Dartmouth's campus newspaper, Andrew Lohse calls the financial recruiting process a brain drain that has ''siphoned off some of our great minds into a dead-end field that sanitizes the intellect, offers almost nothing to human society, and conditions people to act in ways that are decidedly inhuman.'' KEVIN ROOSE
DUELING OVER DODD-FRANK Will the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory overhaul thwart a future crisis? That depends on whom you ask.
''While the Dodd-Frank bill improved matters, it went nowhere far enough,'' Joseph E. Stiglitz, left, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, told the Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday. Conversely, Eugene A. Ludwig, the former comptroller of the currency during the Clinton administration, warned that the law could put ''a deleterious drag on capital formation and meaningful job opportunities for our people.'' BEN PROTESS
EXTENSION The Canadian consortium seeking to acquire the parent of the Toronto stock exchange said on Wednesday that it would extend its offer of 3.8 billion Canadian dollars ($3.95 billion) to Sept. 30.
The offer, from the Maple Group, made up of 13 Canadian banks, pension funds and other institutions, said it would seek regulatory approvals for the deal during the extension.

BYLINE: By KATHRYN SHATTUCK

 BODY:
8 P.M. (Planet Green) DETROIT IN OVERDRIVE Planet Green teams up with General Motors for a three-part program to examine how this city, which once dominated automotive production, is working to rebuild from a devastating economic decline. Part 1 follows creative types like Joe Faris, who moved back home to Detroit from New York to establish Motor City Denim, a fashion line incorporating elements like seat belts and rivets. The items are made in a retrofitted factory that manufactured protective covers for auto-industry robots for more than 30 years. Then there's Badass Beer, which the Grammy-winning rapper Kid Rock devised to bolster employment in his hometown, and First Robotics, an after-school program founded by Dean Kamen, the inventor of the Segway PT, to pique the interest of high school students. 
Part 2, at 9, explores the significance of the arts in Detroit, including an installation by Tyree Guyton (above) focusing on the city's homeless and the Sphinx Organization, which introduces classical music to Latino and black children. And Part 3, at 10, visits with those spearheading local food campaigns and highlights the efforts of Veronika Scott, a fourth-year student at the College for Creative Studies who has designed a heat-capturing coat that turns into a sleeping bag. It is made for the homeless and by the homeless, and has become part of a broader effort to provide housing, food and jobs.
4:30 P.M. (HBO Signature) GREENBERG (2010) In what A. O. Scott of The New York Times called Noah Baumbach's ''funniest and saddest movie'' so far, ''and also the riskiest,'' Ben Stiller plays Roger Greenberg, a 40-year-old former musician who, after a mental breakdown, house-sits in the large Los Angeles home of his vacationing brother. Greta Gerwig portrays Florence Marr, the brother's 25-year-old assistant and Roger's on-again, off-again love interest in his quest to recapture his youth. ''Mr. Stiller, suppressing his well-honed sketch comedian's urge to wink at the audience, turns Roger into a walking challenge to the Hollywood axiom that a movie's protagonist must be likable,'' Mr. Scott wrote. Only at the end does Mr. Baumbach reveal that the film has been ''a romantic comedy all along,'' he said. ''And suddenly a movie about a man who is defiantly difficult to like becomes very hard not to love.'' (Above, Mr. Stiller with Bree Larson, left, and Juno Temple.)
7:15 P.M. (MoreMax) THE INVENTION OF LYING (2009) A mopey screenwriter (Ricky Gervais, who also wrote and directed this film with Matthew Robinson), living in a world where no one can speak anything but the truth, stumbles on a way to get what he wants: he lies. Soon he's rich, successful and close to convincing a beauty (Jennifer Garner, above with Mr. Gervais) that he is worthy of her affections. Writing in The Times, Manohla Dargis said that the main story line was ''generically diverting, but the better, smarter, more ticklish stuff in the movie involves the simple truth that a world without lying is also one without art.'' Mr. Gervais plays his usual character, she added, ''and while that's fine as far it goes, the movie itself would have gone further if he and Mr. Robinson had worked harder on their own sweet lies -- their art.''
9 P.M. (Lifetime) PROJECT RUNWAY The designers must pair up to create attire from materials bought in a pet store. The outfits will be worn by professional stilt walkers in the first outdoor runway show of the series.
9 P.M. (CMT) SWEET HOME ALABAMA Devin Grissom, a student at the University of Alabama who hopes to pursue a public relations career, continues her search for a true love. In this episode she tries to determine whether she's a country girl or a city girl by offering three suitors a romantic trip to New York City and another three a day at the races at the Deep South Speedway in Alabama. Afterward three men will be sent packing. In a new season of ''The Ultimate Merger,'' at 9 on TV One, the television personality Toccara (''Celebrity Fit Club'' and ''America's Top Model'') tries to find love from among 14 men with the guidance of the fitness instructor Harvey Walden and celebrity friends like the crooner Brian McKnight.

HEADLINE: What's Left Behind

BYLINE: By MICHAEL TORTORELLO

 BODY:
CLEVELAND
THIS city contains 20,000 vacant lots, more or less. Probably more. Every year, demolition crews knock down another 1,000 houses. And the housing market being what it is, few souls are returning.
A vacant lot may be a lot of things: an eyesore, a dump, a symbol of American industrial decline. But one thing it is not is vacant. When we leave a yard behind, the bulk of the biomass does not follow us in a U-Haul. Put another way, a dandelion is unmoved by foreclosure. It lingers where it pleases.
And so, on a recent Monday morning, Garrett Ormiston, 29, was taking an informal census of the vegetation occupying an otherwise empty yard on East 93rd Street, just a few miles east of downtown Cleveland.
''Right here is kind of a mix of plants that probably existed as people's landscaping,'' said Mr. Ormiston, a naturalist with the Cleveland Museum of Natural History. ''This here looks like somebody's ornamental rose that has just kind of persisted.'' 
The lot, four-tenths of an acre in size, once comprised four separate parcels. Foreclosure records indicate that in 1991, ''the unknown heirs etc. of Willie James Smedley, a k a James Trask, deceased'' lost title to part of the lot. (They had fallen behind by $4,155.70 on property taxes.) The Living Hope Baptist Church forfeited a different chunk in 2004.
A concrete pad hinted where the buildings might have stood. If the pair of fawns grazing across the street knew anything more than that, they weren't saying.
''This is an old alley,'' Mr. Ormiston said, pointing to a half-buried strip of asphalt. An empty bag of Chester's Puffcorn lay next to a heap of old roofing tile and a blue plastic tarp. A roof will typically stop leaking after you tear down the house.
He walked along a row of shrubs beneath a power line. The neighborhood birds, he said, apparently made a habit of perching here and depositing seeds (and fertilizer), as birds will. ''Whatever they bring, colonizes,'' Mr. Ormiston said. ''You can see all of their favorites.'' There was raspberry, white mulberry, native ''riverside'' grape, Canada thistle (''a really rotten invasive,'' he said), a staghorn sumac and a stand of exotic Norway maple.
With a chain saw and a Bobcat, a homeowner could clear this brush in an afternoon. But no homeowner would be coming this afternoon, or this month, or this summer. To be realistic, it's unlikely that anyone will be coming next summer, either.
One abandoned yard is a mess; 20,000 abandoned yards is an ecosystem. At this scale, Cleveland's vacant land begins to look less like a sign of neglect and more like an ecological experiment spread over some 3,600 acres.
As it happens, a team of local scientists has designated this accidental landscape an Urban Long-Term Research Area -- that is, Ultra. And having won a $272,000 exploratory award from the National Science Foundation, the researchers call their project Ultra-Ex. There's enough turf here for everybody: Ultra-Ex scientists are studying bird and insect populations, watershed systems, soil nematodes and urban farms.
Along with its sci-fi name, Ultra-Ex advances a forward-looking mission: to document the ecological benefits that vacant lots might provide and to redefine the land, from neighborhood blight to community asset.
OF course, Cleveland has no monopoly on vacant land. Tens of thousands of vacancies blot the residential map in major, or once major, Great Lakes cities like Youngstown, Ohio; Flint, Mich., and Buffalo. Some 40,000 parcels are empty in Philadelphia. (New York City does not track the number of vacant lots, according to the Department of City Planning, but 8,902 acres, or 5.8 percent, of the city's land was vacant in 2010.)
And vacancy creates more vacancy, said Bob Grossmann, 66, the director of Philadelphia Green, a program run by the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society, which has pioneered the management of urban vacant land. ''There's a cost to doing nothing,'' he said.
Originally, cities like Cleveland and Flint (and their surrounding counties) assembled vacant tax-forfeited parcels into ''land banks.'' The idea was for these public entities to guide the resale and redevelopment of the land in a strategic fashion.
But with the economy in a coma, private buyers haven't approached the land banks to draw down deposits, said Joan Nassauer, 59, a professor in the School of Natural Resources and Environment at the University of Michigan.
Local governments have been ''left holding many, many, many properties that they would rather not own,'' she said. ''But now they own them, and they've got to manage them.''
The plan that the nonprofit Philadelphia Green has implemented in neighborhoods around the city's core is a kind of ''greening and cleaning'' regime: in TV terms, an extreme makeover. Here, contractors and work crews remove debris, deposit topsoil, plant grass and build a post-and-rail fence. Afterward, they continue to mow the lot.
The nonprofit now maintains 5,200 lots in Philadelphia, at a cost of approximately $800,000 a year. Another $700,000 will go into ''stabilizing'' 500 more lots, in city neighborhoods that show promise for future development.
With city coffers low and its land bank overflowing, Cleveland has been executing a less ambitious plan. City workers attempt to mow the grass before it grows taller than eight inches, at a cost of $3.3 million a year.
For places in straits like these, the question may not be what we can do for our vacant lots but what our vacant lots can do for us. Ms. Nassauer encourages cities to think of ways that open land can clean and replenish the watershed, absorb urban heat and carbon dioxide, and create recreational opportunities.
Would the bare lot on the east side of Cleveland seem more valuable if the neighbors knew it supported perhaps 30 or even 50 species of pollinating bees? What if this disorderly habitat bred a rich diversity of predatory spiders, like wolf spiders, orb weavers, crab spiders and jumping spiders? (O.K., best not to advertise the jumping spiders.)
This summer, Mary Gardiner, 34, an assistant professor of entomology at Ohio State, and her graduate researcher, Caitlin Burkman, 23, have been sampling spider populations in pitfall traps.
The spiders ''kind of walk along, don't notice and then fall in,'' Ms. Burkman said. Soapy water makes it hard to break the surface tension. Then they drown, she said.
''We use some very sophisticated tools,'' Dr. Gardiner added. The trap is ''like a keg cup or something.'' Some traps they bury in empty lots; others go to urban farms. Dr. Gardiner's hypothesis is that the less ''disturbed'' sites (the ungroomed vacancies) may support a broader range of beneficial predatory spiders.
And a tidy lawn would be no place to find the herblike plant that Mr. Ormiston was examining near the ruins of a fencepost.
''This right here is mugwort,'' he said. ''It's in the Artemisia family.'' Mugwort, which shoots up from buried rhizomes, emits a powerful odor and irritates the skin.
''But what's funny is, birds actually collect this plant and weave it into their nests,'' Mr. Ormiston said. ''Its scent repels insects that might bother the nest.''
Before European settlement, some 300 years ago, this area would probably have been a lake plain swamp forest, Mr. Ormiston said. Common trees would have been American elm, shellbark hickory, bur oak, swamp white oak, tupelo and black willow.
We know the original elms won't be coming back. After decades of blight, the trees have retreated from the forest canopy. The swamps and creeks that radiate from Lake Erie have been drained and trapped in culverts. And the climate is getting hotter, or so rumor has it.
In the meantime, poor compacted soils are a welcome mat for invasive plants like Japanese knotweed and Ailanthus.
Still, their lease on the land is not open-ended. Once the city stops mowing (and no one believes Cleveland can mow forever), ''the grasses will grow tall,'' Mr. Ormiston said.
''You'll start to get some wildflowers, things like asters,'' he said. ''Some shrubs like viburnums and dogwoods. But eventually, you'll start getting trees pretty early on: things like cottonwoods and sumacs that colonize really quickly, grow quickly and start paving the way for other trees.''
Terry Schwarz, 47, an Ultra-Ex affiliate who directs the Cleveland Urban Design Collaborative at Kent State University, has heard the worst-case scenario for the city.
''Here in Cleveland,'' she said, ''if you ask people what's going to happen, they'll say: 'Oh, we're going to keep losing population. And Phoenix and Atlanta are going to take our water.' But the truth is, Phoenix and Atlanta have their own expiration date. Every city does.''
Demographers say that the United States population may grow by 120 million in the next 40 years, Ms. Schwarz said. At least a few people, she predicts, will want to live in a temperate central location with an abundant supply of fresh water.
''What happens is one of two things,'' she said. ''Either we reclaim the older industrial cities and repopulate. Or we're going to be building new cities, probably not too far from here.''
In this schema, vacant lots could be the parkland and home sites of tomorrow, if they're managed smartly. In Genesee County, Mich., Ms. Nassauer has developed a list of nine lot treatments to suit different land priorities, like watershed protection and neighborhood resettlement.
One Ultra-Ex project being led by the Cleveland Botanical Garden involves planting a vacant lot in the Buckeye neighborhood with low-mow fescue, a slow-growing pasture grass, and establishing a vegetative fence. Down the block is one of six learning farms that the botanical garden runs through its Green Corps program. With three acres under cultivation and 60 teenage workers, the urban farms will grow and sell or give away 15,000 pounds of fresh produce this summer, said the program's director, Geri Unger.
The Buckeye garden includes raised beds, an herb spiral, a strawberry patch and a hardy kiwi vine snaking up the border fence.
It's easy to convince the neighbors that an orderly, well-tended spot like this one has a civic value. Loraine Ingram, 74, has lived next door for 30 years. Of the community farm, she said, ''I love it.''
Ms. Ingram, a nurse who lost her home health-care job last summer, has a powder blue two-story house with a matching picket fence. While she stood in her driveway, a dog growled savagely from behind a half-boarded-up basement window.
Long before Green Corps moved in, Ms. Ingram recalled, a ''Mr. Owens'' had lived in the house next door. His grandson would take care of him and look after Ms. Ingram's son too. After Mr. Owens died, the house sat empty.
Then, ''four or five years ago,'' she said, ''somebody set it to fire. I came home from work one day, and it was burned.''
The garden moved in last spring. ''I think it's nice,'' Ms. Ingram said. ''I grew up on a farm in Denmark, Tennessee.''
It would be encouraging to believe that urban farms and community gardens could be part of a comprehensive solution. Indeed, the Philadelphia Green program started in the mid-1970s, Mr. Grossmann said, by establishing ''a couple of thousand community gardens.''
But at the same time the program was planting green spaces, other lots were falling fallow. ''People pass away or move out of the neighborhood,'' he said.
Urban farms are labor-intensive, and the initial site cleanup costs can be prohibitive. Ms. Unger, 55, estimates that ''maybe there's 40 to 50 acres under urban farming,'' in Cleveland. ''Maybe up to 100 acres. If we could get up to 10 percent urban farms'' -- some 360 acres -- ''I think we would be doing really great. But that's not going to solve the urban vacancy problem you see.''
A FALLBACK is to do nothing. A group of four vacant parcels on Union Avenue, known to Ultra-Ex researchers as Control Site 6, offers a snapshot of the status quo.
Mobs of thigh-high weeds (mustard green, chicory, Queen Anne's lace) were starting to gather in front of a tumbledown garage. The plan, it appeared, was to wait until no one was looking and then overrun the rest of the yard.
''Last year they were definitely mowing it more,'' said Dr. Gardiner, the Ohio State entomologist. ''A lot of stuff will flower and go to seed if it doesn't get mowed.''
Vacancy begets vacancy. Weeds beget weeds.
At the end of a sloping remnant of pavement, Mr. Ormiston found a patch of mint interspersed with comfrey. ''I think this plant could very well have been here as part of someone's garden and gone wild after it was abandoned,'' he said.
Alvesta McGriff, 79, a retired hospital worker, remembered a vegetable patch growing in the yard. As the afternoon sun harried pedestrians into the shade, she sat on the porch of the house next door, which she has occupied since 1966. Between the hedge and the front stair lay a single Timberland boot.
A grocer used one of the parcels, selling produce fresh out of the ground, she recounted. A TV repair shop with two apartments filled another part of the lot. It belonged, she said, to a ''Mr. John White,'' who had rented it out. ''But he has passed and gone on,'' Ms. McGriff said. And his building with him.
''When I moved in, this neighborhood was beautiful and clean,'' she said. If there was an ecological value to the lot next door, she didn't see it.
''I hate it,'' she said. ''They don't keep it up or nothing. It's in bad shape. This neighborhood has really gone down.''
A man with a straw hat and a brown paper bag -- Eddie Thomas, 55 -- charged across the street. ''When are you going to mow that place?'' he yelled, including a few other words for emphasis. The answer, ''Not today,'' appeared neither to please nor surprise him.
Mr. Thomas lives in Ms. McGriff's house, and Dr. Gardiner had met him in the yard before. ''The first time we came out, he was very nice,'' she said. ''And every time we come back, he gets progressively more frustrated.'' For this, Dr. Gardiner blamed him not at all.
With Ultra-Ex researchers visiting the site every week, ''there's 40 people walking around here, looking in the air, vacuuming the leaves,'' she said. ''He's sick of a lot of people coming up here and doing a lot of things, except the one thing he wants done. Which is to mow the grass.''
Driving away from Site 6 and Cleveland's east side, you can imagine someone like Mr. Thomas cursing the unmown grass every morning and evening, for years on end. Until one day, he will look over from the porch and the grass will be gone. And a wood will have taken its place.

HEADLINE: MasterCard Profits Gain From Customers Abroad

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
MasterCard said second-quarter profit jumped 33 percent, as inflation in the United States lifted spending volume and more international consumers used debit and credit cards.
Its shares rose 13.39 percent, or $39.98, to close at $338.47 on the news. 
MasterCard said signing up two big banks -- SunTrust Banks and Banco Santander's American affiliate Sovereign Bank -- to offer MasterCard debit cards had helped increase revenue in the second quarter. The two banks previously offered Visa debit cards.
MasterCard executives told analysts on a conference call that the company had benefited from overseas customers using debit and credit cards instead of cash to make payments.
United States economic weakness is now translating to slower inflation or even deflation, which could cut into the dollar size of transactions that MasterCard processes in the coming quarters. But analysts said the company's expanding international business can offset any domestic slowdown.
''They're getting strength from other areas,'' said Shannon Stemm, a financial services analyst with Edward Jones.
MasterCard on Wednesday reported second-quarter net income of $608 million or $4.76 a share, up from $458 million, or $3.49 a share, a year earlier.
Analysts had expected $4.23 a share, according to Thomson Reuters. Visa also beat analysts' expectations when it reported quarterly results last week.
MasterCard executives said they would alter their debit interchange fee structure before new industry fee caps were imposed on those charges later this year.
The fees are charged to merchants for processing customers' debit card transactions. The so-called Durbin amendment to the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law placed a cap on those fees and takes effect later this year.
Last week, Visa said it would introduce a flat network participation fee, and lowered the per-transaction rate for processing all United States transactions.
MasterCard's revenue increased 22 percent to $1.7 billion as its cross-border and overseas business grew.
Over all, MasterCard's cross-border transactions rose 19.3 percent, and processed transactions increased 17.4 percent.
The company said it also gained from new processing business in the Netherlands and Brazil.
Total operating expenses increased 20 percent to $782 million. MasterCard said the rise was because of higher personnel costs related to acquisitions.

HEADLINE: Manhattan as Warhol Knew It

BYLINE: By JAN HOFFMAN

 BODY:
ON this summer afternoon, the Andy Warhol's New York City Tour does not begin at any location where the artist lived, worked or partied. Instead, it starts at 1060 Park Avenue.
That is where Truman Capote was living with his mother in 1952, and where a young worshipper from Pittsburgh, Andy Warhol, could once be spotted, standing outside.
''Capote was an overnight sensation,'' said Thomas Kiedrowski, the tour guide. ''Andy Warhol was thinking, 'This guy has my life.' So Andy did what he could to be friends with Capote. He sent him postcards. He became friends with Capote's mother. I could just see Warhol lingering here, waiting to meet him.'' 
To say that Mr. Kiedrowski has a passion for all things Warhol would be an understatement. Bald and beaming, he owns close to 175 books about the artist, who would have turned 83 on Saturday. He has just published his own addition to the pile: ''Andy Warhol's New York City: Four Walks, Uptown to Downtown.'' Vito Giallo, who ran an antiques store frequented by Warhol, contributed illustrations.
The pocket guide is almost as sweet and earnest as Mr. Kiedrowski himself, who, since 2004, has studied phone books from the early 1960s to pinpoint addresses in Warhol's life, immersed himself in the history of those buildings and befriended aging Warholites.
''They have become family to me,'' said Mr. Kiedrowski, who is 37 but seems a decade younger. His meticulous guide reimagines Manhattan as Andy Land.
''Thomas has dedicated his life to finding out arcane facts about Warhol,'' said Eric Shiner, director of the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh. ''He does a very good job of getting to the bottom of mysteries. I love to see the architectural side of Andy articulated.''
Mr. Kiedrowski stood in front of 1342 Lexington Avenue at 89th, an 1889 Northern Renaissance row-house where Warhol lived from 1960 to 1974, much of that time, like Mr. Capote, with his mother.
''It was just sold again,'' Mr. Kiedrowski said. ''A few weeks ago the Realtor was going in and I happened to be here. I said, 'Could you? Could you?' And he said, 'Sure!' I was so excited.''
Although Warhol died at age 58 in 1987, celebrations of his myth-making life as a Pop artist, filmmaker, magazine publisher, music entrepreneur, shopper, scene maker and gossip keep surging. Mr. Shiner said the museum will send exhibits to Singapore, Istanbul and Mexico City. ''Pop!'' a musical about Warhol, played in Washington this summer. Mr. Kiedrowski, who receives about two dozen tour requests a year (warholtour.com), took one Australian fan on a tour that lasted six hours.
Warhol has been a spiritual light for Mr. Kiedrowski since he was a teenager in a blue-collar family just outside of Milwaukee.
''I was a little lonely and I didn't know I was gay till the end of high school,'' he said. An indifferent student, he thought he would become a factory worker. Then he read David Bourdon's 1989 biography of Warhol.
''He was poor and he showed that if you worked hard, you could make something of your life,'' Mr. Kiedrowski said of the artist. ''And he was a loner who learned to get out of his shell, like me.''
After high school, Mr. Kiedrowski followed a boyfriend to Alabama, where he worked in a sock mill. Eventually he returned to Milwaukee, where he graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, majoring in film production. He worked as a go-fer for a C-minus list Hollywood couple. When that position crumbled, he moved to New York, in 2002.
Mr. Kiedrowski found work at companies that produced Web sites. At first, he had few acquaintances. But he kept Victor Bockris's 1989 biography of Warhol on his office desk. He became an Andy-didact, reading about society and art in New York during the Warhol decades. No Warhol film was too eye-glazing for him.
''I watched 'Empire,' '' he said. ''It's eight hours and five minutes. It went by faster than you'd think.''
Although ''fact'' and ''truth'' were plastic toys to Warhol, Mr. Kiedrowski yearned for precision. ''I didn't have enough information about the Silver Factory,'' he said, referring to the first of Warhol's ''factory'' spaces, which was razed in 1969. ''Where was it? How old is the building? I needed to find out.''
He spent Saturdays in the library. ''It had a photo!'' he said. ''It's amazing: 231 East 47th Street, fourth floor. The Holy Grail. That's where he had his '50 Most Beautiful People Party,' where Edie Sedgwick became a star, and so did the Brillo boxes.''
When the Web site company folded two years ago, he collected unemployment and more Warholiana. A fellow Warholite suggested he offer tours. Another prodded him to approach the Little Bookroom, which publishes guides. He was astonished when the company welcomed him, as if Warhol were rewarding him for his hard work.
The tour continued. He stopped at churches where Warhol prayed regularly, paused at his prime address at 57 East 66th Street (completed April 30, 1902, notes his book) and headed downtown, spending a reverent moment before 213 Park Avenue South, which used to be Max's Kansas City, the famous club.
Mr. Kiedrowski arrived at the temporary Andy Monument in Union Square. Tourists gawked at the chrome statue by Robert Pruitt of Warhol carrying a Bloomingdale's Medium Brown Bag. ''Is that Andy from 'Toy Story'?'' a woman asked.
How would Mr. Kiedrowski celebrate Warhol's birthday this Saturday? A party with elderly Warholites had already been held Tuesday evening.
''I'd love to do a tour with people wearing Warhol wigs and glasses,'' Mr. Kiedrowski promptly replied, looking radiant. ''All these Warhols walking around the city? It would be fantastic!''
Correction: August 18, 2011, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Aug. 4 about Thomas Kiedrowski, who conducts Andy Warhol-themed tours of New York City, omitted part of the name of his alma mater. It is the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, one of 13 universities in the University of Wisconsin system; it is not the ''University of Wisconsin.''

HEADLINE: For Disabled Man Left in Van, Cause of Death Is Unclear

BYLINE: By RUSS BUETTNER

 BODY:
The dark Ford Econoline van sat on a busy avenue in East Harlem through a warm morning and well into a hot afternoon on Tuesday, with Alonzo Eason, a developmentally disabled man, slumping in the rear seat, according to police and state officials. 
At 3:30 p.m., with the temperature outside hovering around 90 degrees, someone finally discovered Mr. Eason collapsed and unresponsive in the last row of seats. An ambulance was called, and Mr. Eason, 48, was pronounced dead at the scene, the police said Wednesday.
The medical examiner's office said Wednesday that the cause of Mr. Eason's death was still under review.
Mr. Eason had been living in a 14-bed group home on East Fifth Street run by AHRC New York City, a nonprofit organization contracted by the state to care for developmentally disabled individuals. As on most days, he had been transported uptown on Tuesday to a day program on Lexington Avenue, near 125th Street, also operated by AHRC.
Sometime between 9 and 10 a.m., the other developmentally disabled adults in the van were escorted inside, where they spent the day working on things like communication skills, personal hygiene and money management, according to the State Office for People With Developmental Disabilities, which oversees nonprofit organizations like AHRC.
Mr. Eason was left behind.
''Let me be clear: It is unacceptable that this man's absence went unnoticed for several hours,'' said Courtney Burke, commissioner of the state agency.
Ms. Burke said her agency had demanded ''corrective action'' from AHRC to prevent similar tragedies.
She said she had reminded the agency's providers of attendance verification requirements and was exploring whether new regulations were needed.
Mr. Eason was nonverbal, typically needed assistance walking, and was known for his calm, mostly passive personality, said one person familiar with him who requested anonymity to discuss matters protected by privacy laws. Developmental disabilities include conditions like cerebral palsy, Down syndrome and autism.
AHRC, one of the largest and oldest nonprofit providers of services to developmentally disabled people in the state, has annual revenue exceeding $200 million and runs group homes with nearly 600 beds.
It declined to release details of the death, but issued a statement saying Mr. Eason had spent much of his life in its programs.
''He will be missed by his friends,'' the statement said, adding that Mr. Eason would be ''forever in our thoughts.''
The police will investigate whether leaving Mr. Eason in the van constituted a crime. His death will also be investigated by the Commission on Quality of Care and Advocacy for Persons With Disabilities, a state watchdog agency.
The commission's chairman, Roger Bearden, said, ''This tragedy raises serious concerns as to why no safeguards appear to have been in place to protect this individual.''

HEADLINE: Basics of Accounting Are Vital to Survival For Entrepreneurs

BYLINE: By DARREN DAHL

 BODY:
Few people start a business because they are good with numbers. In fact, the terms ''accounting'' and ''financial analysis'' tend to put business owners to sleep or send them screaming from the room. But to run a business effectively, most owners need to have some understanding of their finances.
It is, for example, entirely possible for a company to be profitable but fail anyway because it does not have enough cash coming in to pay its bills.
''It's like a racecar that goes too fast and runs out of gas,'' said Doug Tatum, a serial entrepreneur who is a visiting professor of entrepreneurship at Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro. Business owners do not necessarily need to know how to prepare a balance sheet, but they do have to know which gauges to watch. 
One obvious step is to work with a bookkeeper or accountant, someone who can help navigate arcane accounting and tax rules and organize your affairs. But owners should understand that accounting is not just about paying taxes or reporting results.
''Small-business owners tend to hate accounting because it's boring,'' said Brian Hamilton, chief executive of Sageworks, a company in Raleigh, N.C., that tracks financial data for privately held businesses. ''The mistake they make is not thinking about how they can use certain numbers as tools to better manage where their business is headed tomorrow.''
What follows is a guide to better understanding the numbers that drive a business. As the examples make clear, even smart people with advanced degrees can become confused by accounting issues. DON'T MISTAKE DEBT FOR PROFIT After earning a master's degree in industrial engineering, Bart Justice figured he would get a job doing computer simulations or technical sales. Then in 2004, he learned about the paper-shredding industry, which was booming because of a rash of new security laws. Mr. Justice obtained a loan from a local bank to buy a mobile shredding truck, hired a truck driver and opened shop in Huntsville, Ala., as Secure Destruction Service.
The company hit $70,000 in sales its first year. Within four years, Secure Destruction had annual revenue of $500,000 and employed six people across two offices, one in Huntsville, the other in Birmingham, Ala.
To finance his growth -- adding a shredding truck, for example -- Mr. Justice kept borrowing money from the bank, not realizing that the more he grew, the more he needed to borrow because his revenue was not covering his expenses. The loans meant he had money in his accounts -- but it was borrowed money.
''I knew how to print a financial statement from QuickBooks, but I couldn't tell you what it meant,'' he said.
It was not until early 2008 when he joined a peer group for Christian business owners called C12, that Mr. Justice was forced to confront the truth. ''They would ask me questions about my numbers, and I didn't know how to answer them,'' he said. ''They told me my business was going to fail unless I got a handle on paying down my debt.''
He hired an accountant and began analyzing how aspects of his business were performing, which led him to sell several pieces of equipment and to stop serving clients if he was losing money on them.
The advice proved timely. As the recession set in, the market for shredding collapsed. But with a leaner and smarter operation, Secure Destruction survived.
MANAGE RECEIVABLES Two years ago, Paul Burns brought on Eric Edelson as a partner to help run Fireclay Tile, which is based in San Jose, Calif., and manufactures ceramic tile using recycled materials. Mr. Edelson, who had left a career as an investment banker in New York to get an M.B.A. at Stanford, knew the business had been struggling, but he was hopeful that he could help.
One number that looked impressive to him was the company's accounts receivable balance, which was more than $100,000. That was money owed to Fireclay by its wholesale clients. ''At first, I thought it was kind of neat since we could count on all that cash coming in,'' Mr. Edelson said. ''But after I started digging into it, I noticed a lot of stale accounts that were more than six months overdue.''
Mr. Edelson hired a third-party company to help Fireclay collect its receivables, but many of the companies had gone out of business. Sensing a lost cause, he changed tactics. After writing off most of the balance, he stopped sending new shipments to customers who had a balance due and started getting more upfront payments and staying on top of customers.
By making sure customers could not buy more tile until they paid for what they had already bought, Mr. Edelson gave his customers an incentive to pay up. That has helped cut Fireclay's receivables balance to less than $30,000.
UNDERSTAND YOUR EXPENSES After he graduated from law school five years ago, Daniel Gershburg, then 24, decided to open a bankruptcy and real estate law practice in Brooklyn. ''I literally didn't know anything about accounting,'' Mr. Gershburg said. The only number he paid attention to was the gross sales he was pulling in through retainers.
He said he believed that to build his fledgling legal business, he needed to spend money on advertising. In fact, even though his revenue was only $5,000 a month, he started spending as much as $4,000 a month on television commercials, Internet ads and search engine optimization.
The result was a vicious cycle: the more revenue he took in, the more compelled he felt to buy more ads to land additional clients. His expenses were increasing faster than his revenue.
Eventually, Mr. Gershburg decided to cut his advertising budget. With fewer clients coming in the door, he raised his prices on current clients because he could now spend more time on their cases. As the quality of his work improved, he began landing more referrals, which did not cost him a dime in advertising.
''By shrinking my practice,'' Mr. Gershburg said, ''I was able to double my profit in a single year.''
TRACK YOUR BREAK-EVEN In 2003, when Todd Campbell decided to start E.B. Capital Markets, which provides research on the stock market to portfolio managers, he focused on building and marketing his product. ''The last thing I wanted to figure out was the nuts and bolts of keeping track of receivables and payables,'' he said. ''I hated accounting.''
He hired a bookkeeper, but he paid attention only at tax time. Then the recession hit, and Mr. Campbell, whose company is based in Durham, N.H., recognized that he needed to get a better handle on how his company was performing, including whether he would be able to make payroll.
That is when he seized upon the notion of tracking his break-even number, the point at which revenue for a given period equals expenses. To do the calculation requires knowing total expenses and gross profit percentage, which is determined by dividing gross profit by sales.
Here's how to do the math: If Mr. Campbell's monthly expenses were $20,000 and if his gross profit percentage was 50 percent, he would divide $20,000 by 50 percent to get a break-even number of $40,000 -- the amount he had to sell to break even.
''It is the single best indicator because it helps you see if the canary in the coal mine is getting woozy,'' Mr. Campbell said. ''Now I know what decisions I have to make today so that I don't have to panic a few months from now.''

HEADLINE: Security Firm Sees Global Cyberspying

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA and KEVIN DREW; David Barboza reported from Shanghai, and Kevin Drew from Hong Kong. John Markoff contributed reporting from San Francisco and Somini Sengupta from Las Vegas.

 BODY:
SHANGHAI -- An American cybersecurity company issued a report on Wednesday saying that it had identified a single perpetrator of cyberattacks that lasted up to five years on a wide range of governments, American corporations and even United Nations groups, and that the pattern of targets suggested the attacker was a ''state actor.''
However, as with a number of other alarming recent reports on computer spying, the study offered few details that would allow independent verification, and it was difficult to immediately assess the damage done. It did not identify the location of the attacking computer system, say what kinds of documents or information were stolen, or offer any direct evidence of a state's involvement. 
The company, McAfee, said it had identified 72 targets -- 49 of them American, including 14 federal, state and county agencies and 11 defense contractors -- and also informed law enforcement agencies, which it said were investigating.
The White House referred questions to the Department of Homeland Security. At a news conference on other matters, that department's secretary, Janet Napolitano, said: ''We became aware of the McAfee report, I think, today, which is when it was released to the press, as well. We obviously will evaluate it, look at it and pursue what needs to be pursued in terms of its contents.''
One of the few named organizations, the World Anti-Doping Agency, cast doubt on the report's assertion that the agency had been subject to a 14-month attack that began in August 2009. In a statement, the director general, David Howman, acknowledged that the agency had experienced an e-mail breach in February 2008, but that ''at this stage, W.A.D.A. has no evidence from its security experts of the intrusions as listed by McAfee and the agency has yet to be convinced that they took place.''
McAfee, which was recently acquired by Intel, said it released the report to coincide with the start on Wednesday of the annual Black Hat technical security conference in Las Vegas. Briefings were scheduled to be delivered at the conference. Details of the study were first published on the Web site of Vanity Fair.
Asked why McAfee decided not to identify most of the corporations that were targets in the attacks, the company said that the corporations were worried about being identified and alarming shareholders or customers.
Cybersecurity is now a major international concern, with hackers gaining access to sensitive corporate and military secrets, including intellectual property. The report comes after high-profile computer network attacks aimed at the International Monetary Fund, Sony and the Lockheed Martin Corporation, America's largest military contractor.
Concern over attacks being carried out by nation-states is rising sharply, particularly after Google said last year that Chinese hackers stole some of the company's source code. Many security experts say the Chinese government has built up a sophisticated cyberwarfare unit and that the government might be partnering with professional hackers. But the list of entities, government or private, suspected of hacking campaigns, is a long one.
Jeff Moss, an Internet security expert who founded the Black Hat Conference, said it would be hard to narrow down the suspects in a broad campaign. ''China is a pretty convenient punching bag,'' he said.
The company's 14-page report, written by Dmitri Alperovitch, McAfee's vice president for threat research, traced the attacks to at least 2006 and said they peaked in 2009. It calls the attacks highly sophisticated and said targets included governments, companies, and organizations in Canada, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Switzerland and Britain.
''After painstaking analysis of the logs, even we were surprised by the enormous diversity of the victim organizations and were taken aback by the audacity of the perpetrators,'' the report said.
McAfee said it identified a single perpetrator in March, when it discovered detailed logs of attacks while reviewing the contents of a server it had discovered in 2009 as part of an investigation into security breaches at defense companies. Joris Evers, a spokesman for McAfee, said the server was in a Western country but that he could not be more specific.
McAfee called the attacks Operation Shady RAT -- RAT stands for remote access tool, a type of software used to control networked computers.
The duration of the attacks ranged from a month to what McAfee said was a sustained 28-month attack against an Olympic committee of an unidentified Asian nation.
What was done with the data ''is still largely an open question,'' Mr. Alperovitch wrote in the report. ''However, if even a fraction of it is used to build better competing products or beat a competitor at a key negotiation (due to having stolen the other team's playbook), the loss represents a massive economic threat.''
Mr. Moss said subjects of attacks should be more forthcoming. ''Companies do the public a disservice by not revealing when these things happen,'' he said.
In mid-May, the Obama administration proposed creating international computer security standards with penalties for countries and organizations that fell short. The strategy calls for officials from the State Department, the Pentagon, the Justice Department, the Commerce Department and the Department of Homeland Security to work with their counterparts around the world to come up with international standards.
Obama administration officials said privately at the time that the hope was that the initiative would prod China and Russia into allowing more Internet freedom, cracking down on intellectual property theft and enacting stricter laws to protect computer users' privacy.
In February, a Canadian federal cabinet minister said hackers, perhaps from China, had compromised computers in two Canadian government departments in early January, leaving bureaucrats with little or no Internet access for nearly two months. The minister, Stockwell B. Day Jr., the president of the Treasury Board, called the attack a ''significant one'' that went after financial records.
Also in February, McAfee released a report saying that at least five multinational oil and gas companies had suffered computer network attacks by a group of hackers based in China. Beijing has strongly denied any role in computer network attacks, and insisted it has been a frequent victim of such attacks itself.
On Wednesday, China's Foreign Ministry did not respond to requests for comment about the latest McAfee report.
But last month, at a regularly scheduled news conference in Beijing, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, Hong Lei, said, ''The Chinese government opposes hacking in all its manifestations.''
He added: ''Hacking is an international issue, with which China also falls victim. China is willing to conduct international cooperation in this regard. We are dissatisfied with some people's irresponsible remarks that link hacker attacks with the Chinese government.''

HEADLINE: Shares Waver, Then Eke Out Gains to End a Losing Streak

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER; Bettina Wassener contributed reporting.

 BODY:
After seven days of losing ground, the stock market made some back on Wednesday.
Stocks on Wall Street fluctuated between gains and losses before technology shares helped to lift the indexes in a final push, ending the longest streak of losses in the broader market since October 2008.
The decline in stocks has played out amid financial markets unsettled by the prospects of weak economic data in the United States and as investors tried to sort through the possible outcomes for the economy posed by the debt ceiling process and the finished plan that was finally hammered out in Washington this week. 
That uncertainty weighed on equities, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index shaving off more than 6 percent and reaching a new low for the year, over the seven consecutive trading days through Tuesday.
On Wednesday, the three main indexes finally firmed. At the close, the S.& P. was up 6.29 points, or 0.50 percent, at 1,260.34, just barely enough to restore the index to positive territory for the year to date once again. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 29.82 points, or 0.25 percent, at 11,896.44, and the Nasdaq rose 23.83 points, or 0.89 percent, to 2,693.07.
Markets have been beset by bad data in recent days even as investors were riding the turbulence set off by the drawn-out negotiations over the debt ceiling. Recent reports in the United States on gross domestic product and consumer spending have done little to ease the outlook ahead of Friday's report on unemployment.
On Wednesday, new data showed that expansion in the services sector was slowing. The Institute for Supply Management index for the nonmanufacturing sector declined to 52.7 in July, the lowest level since February 2010.
Adrian Cronje, the chief investment officer of Balentine, said that as concerns persisted about the euro zone and the United States economy, investors were starting to turn their focus to whether the debt ceiling deal's cuts could create further headwinds for growth and whether earnings, one of the few bright spots, could be sustained.
''People are really taking a step back and saying, 'How long can this period of record corporate profits continue?' '' he asked. ''There is very little room now to stimulate the economy if it continues to underperform expectations.''
Another analyst said that now that the debt ceiling process was in the rear-view mirror, it might actually help alleviate some of the uncertainty. He added that the economic indicators were slowing, partly because of supply problems related to the earthquake and tsunami in Japan and other issues, but not grinding to a halt.
''In general we are seeing by and large it is just less growth,'' said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist of Key Private Bank. ''Our conclusion is a lot of the measures are still backward looking.''
''Consumers will spend more once we get beyond the insanity of Washington and alleviate worries,'' he added, saying that people were worried about the debt ceiling negotiations in addition to the slower economy.
''In general the market tends to be gripped by emotional excess,'' said Mr. McCain. ''There was certainly a lot of disappointment over surprisingly bad news but in the end of it you step back and say, 'We have driven prices remarkably lower,' and the selling excesses exhaust themselves. You get a chance to bounce off the bottom.''
He said the current climate has led him to become more neutral, but not defensive.
''We are just not going to take big bets,'' he said.
But the debt ceiling deal has not completely removed doubts about the impact on the credit rating. ''Bonds are seesawing on whether there still could be a potential downgrade,'' Mr. Cronje said.
The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note slipped 1/32, to 104 12/32, and the yield rose to 2.62 percent from 2.61 percent late Tuesday.
Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings reaffirmed their triple-A rating for the United States, but Moody's put a negative outlook on the country's rating on Tuesday, a sign that a downgrade remains possible. It warned that further fiscal consolidation would probably be needed and that any slowing in United States economic growth also would pose a risk.
Fitch echoed the caution, saying that while the debt ceiling agreement reached in Washington was an important first step, it was ''not the end of the process toward putting in place a credible plan to reduce the budget deficit to a level that would secure the United States' AAA status over the medium-term.''

HEADLINE: The Words We Live By

BYLINE: By DWIGHT GARNER

 BODY:
Among the many things to marvel over in ''Talk to Me,'' a new exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art about how people and objects communicate, is a device called the ''communication prosthesis.'' It's a rigid mouthpiece that stretches the lips wide, exposing the wearer's teeth and gums. It forces timid people to look as aggressive and unhinged as Heath Ledger's Joker in ''The Dark Knight.''
As I stood before this device, it occurred to me that it was, to no small degree, a visual manifestation of the semantic landscape of Manhattan -- a place where words are loud, large, strange, tinnitus-inducing, sometimes beautifully vulgar, straining to be heard. Language here has teeth; it seeks you out; it wants a piece of you. 
I'm a book critic, a person who evaluates words for a living, and the city, surely, offers its own shifting types of poetry, worth pausing to observe and consider. So on a sunny day in July, I spent a day in Manhattan -- along with my two kids, Penn and Harriet -- in search of language on a smaller, more fugitive scale. We walked across the city and took subways and cabs, looking at everyday words: the language of street signs and menus, MetroCards and T-shirts. Our close attention was rewarded. This was a movable feast.
We planned our day around a few of our favorite things: breakfast at Barney Greengrass, the Old World smoked-fish and bialys emporium on the Upper West Side; a visit to MoMA; stops at the Forbidden Planet comics store and the venerable used-book market the Strand (providentially, these are on the same block); lunch in Chinatown; and finally a visit to Economy Candy, the dowdy sweets warehouse on the Lower East Side. If my kids, like my dogs, had tails, even a whispered mention of Economy Candy would make them knock over side tables.
My family recently moved to western New Jersey; a bus trip is a convenient way to reach New York City. The surprises began when, aboard our early-morning Trans-Bridge bus, we decided to read together, for the first time, the small print on the back of our ticket stubs. Here is the sentence we encountered, mandated by the United States Department of Transportation: ''Seating aboard vehicles operated in interstate or foreign commerce is without regard to race, color, creed or national origin.''
Two thoughts leapt to mind. First, is this language necessary 56 years after Rosa Parks? Second, and more alarmingly, what if this bus were traveling between points in New Jersey -- say, Princeton and Asbury Park -- and not ''interstate''? Would discrimination be tolerated? The ticket stub does not mention cellphone abusers. These people should always be exiled to the back of the bus, the despised place that Martin Amis has called -- referring to airplanes -- ''toilet world.''
Barney Greengrass is a half-block from West 86th Street, part of which is also known as Isaac Bashevis Singer Boulevard. We stopped and stared at Singer's street sign. My daughter, who is 12, recently became a vegetarian, and among the details I recalled of this lovely writer's life is that he was a vegetarian as well.
''I did not become a vegetarian for my health,'' Singer said. ''I did it for the health of the chickens.''
On that street sign Singer's name is spelled entirely in capital letters -- in all-caps, as word people say. This turned out to be worth noticing. New York City is in the process of eliminating its all-caps street signs; they turn out to be less legible than those in upper- and lower-case. The New York Observer has called this sign-swapping project, due to be completed in 2018, a ''$28 million copy edit.''
At Barney Greengrass, the pretentious food cretin in me, who likes to eat unusual things partly because of their names, was tempted by something called ''Nova Scotia Heads and Wings Broiled With Onions.'' (Thanks to the obsession with so-called nose-to-tail eating, I await a dish called, after an underpraised Elvis Costello song, ''Pads, Paws and Claws.'') I had the scrambled eggs with sturgeon, an old and reliable friend.
A sonic benefit of being in Manhattan is overhearing atypical conversation. At breakfast we were seated next to a table of academics, all of them philosophers. Among the bits of overheard language, much of it about Hegel, we heard: ''So many monstrous arguments''; ''the guy can't write''; and ''you have to have something weird and surprising to say.''
We wandered outside to read, in the window, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's proclamation of June 18, 2008, as ''Barney Greengrass Day'' in New York City. Here's a line from that proclamation we liked: ''President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered smoked sturgeon from here for his Thanksgiving feast in 1939.''
On the 30-block walk from Barney Greengrass to MoMA, we began to notice the signage that's grown up, like Orwellian kudzu, alerting citizens that they are under video surveillance. Some of these signs are municipal, others private. You begin to realize that, should you commit a bizarre or illegal act, it would be filmed from more angles than a penalty kick in the World Cup. Security cameras have added a time-killing, if eerie, game to my family's repertory; my son, especially, in any kind of store, loves to play ''Spot the Security Cameras.''
Walking, we also began to pay attention to what the writer Alison Lurie, in her book ''The Language of Clothes'' (1981), called ''legible clothing.'' If our research is indicative of anything, tourists have cast off their Gap, Old Navy and Tommy Hilfiger logo T-shirts and are now wearing ones that announce the brand name Aeropostale. I saw only one band T-shirt all day, but it was a classic of tastelessness. A hairy guy wore a vintage shirt that read, ''I'd walk over you to see the Who,'' a reference to a 1979 concert in Cincinnati at which 11 people were crushed in a stampede. Rock on, tasteless hairy guy.
Writing too much about MoMA here would be cheating, to some degree. But do visit the ''Talk to Me'' exhibition. It is possible to listen to the (amplified) sounds made by trees and to see a billboard that both houses bats and translates their language into words. These things are cooler than they sound.
Leaving MoMA, we noted the large brushed-silver letters outside that spelled: ''The Ronald S. and Jo Carole Lauder Building.'' This is a perfect example of a kind of signage that my colleague Charles Isherwood has called, in a brilliant coinage, ''graffiti of the philanthropic class.''
At Forbidden Planet -- a geek nirvana filled with toys, comics, posters, T-shirts and graphic novels -- my kids ogled dolls from ''The Simpsons'' while I considered the purchase of a set of dapper figurines from the Quentin Tarantino movie ''Reservoir Dogs.'' An excellent T-shirt from ''The Big Lebowski'' stared down from one wall, a star-spangled drawing of John Goodman above one of the film's indelible lines: ''I don't roll on Shabbos.'' (Too bad the T-shirt misspells it ''Shabbas.'' One sale lost.)
At the Strand I lingered on a set of stairs, reading clips from years of tabloid gossip pages that mentioned the store, including a report by Liz Smith about the time that Michael Jackson kept the Strand open two hours after closing, wandering around buying biographies of Howard Hughes and Marvin Gaye. There's also an old George Will column framed on the wall, with the vaguely Etonian headline ''Hail to Thee, Old Strand.''
The cab ride to Chinatown did not provide much in the way of reading material, unless you wanted to press your fingers against the greasy screen of the video monitor now installed in each car. (This is where the passenger's bill of rights has been hidden.) Once in Chinatown, we ate at New Yeah Shanghai Deluxe because the menu looked great and because we loved the name. Restaurant names could use some extra exuberance. Per Se Hey!
A visit to the men's room in New Yeah Shanghai Deluxe turned up a sign, taped beside the toilet, that read: ''Please do not throw tissues into toilet bowel. Thank you.'' Some kind person -- surely trying to be, as Henry James put it, ''one of those on whom nothing is lost'' -- had inked over the ''e'' in bowel.
At Economy Candy my children ran wild: I'd given them $12 each to throw to the candy gods. Me? I bought a small box of novelty gum with an inscrutable yet somehow delightful slogan: ''I Blogged Your Mama.''
Those sound like fighting words. Where's my communication prosthesis?
In The Art of Summer, critics for The Times are writing about everyday seasonal experiences.

HEADLINE: Reports Point to Continued Weak Economic Growth

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Service businesses like restaurants, hotels and financial companies experienced their weakest growth in 17 months in July, a new report said Wednesday.
The report, from the Institute for Supply Management, was consistent with other data that show the economy was struggling two years after the recession officially ended. 
The trade group of purchasing executives said its index for services companies fell to 52.7, from 53.3 in June. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion.
The I.S.M. index covers 90 percent of the work force. It reached a five-year high of 59.7 in February, but has fallen since then. The July reading was the lowest since February 2010.
New orders to service companies, an indication of future business, increased but at the slowest rate since August 2009, according to the I.S.M. report. Services firms are still hiring more workers, the report said. But employment growth dropped in July.
The report ''suggests that the economy is not slipping into a recession but instead that growth is very weak,'' said Paul Dales, an economist at Capital Economics.
Separately, the Commerce Department reported that businesses cut orders for airplanes, autos and heavy machinery in June. Factory orders dropped 0.8 percent, the second decline in three months.
Demand for durable goods fell 1.9 percent in June. Durable goods are products that are expected to last at least three years.
An important measure of business investment plans increased slightly, a positive sign amid mostly gloomy data. But business demand for transportation equipment fell 8.6 percent. That was mostly because of a big decline in volatile orders for commercial aircraft. But orders for autos and auto parts also dropped.
The reports follow a stream of dismal economic news in the last week.
Economic growth slowed to less than 1 percent in the first six months of this year, the government said Friday.
Consumer spending, which drives 70 percent of economic activity, fell in June for the first time since September 2009.
And manufacturers recorded their weakest growth in two years in July, according to the separate I.S.M. manufacturing index that was released Monday.
As the economy has slumped, so has hiring. Employers added only 18,000 jobs in June, the fewest in nine months. The unemployment rate rose to 9.2 percent, the highest level this year.
The Labor Department said Wednesday that unemployment rates rose in more than 90 percent of the nation's cities in June, mirroring the national slowdown in hiring.
The I.S.M., a trade group of purchasing executives based in Tempe, Ariz., compiles its service sector index by surveying about 375 purchasing executives across the country.

HEADLINE: The F.A.A., After the Republicans: Their hostage-taking continues, even after they left town

 BODY:
Here is what has happened since the Federal Aviation Administration lost its authorization on July 23, courtesy of House Republicans. The agency has not collected more than $300 million in taxes (money the airlines have mostly pocketed). It has had to furlough some 4,000 workers and halt construction projects worth $11 billion in 241 airports, putting 70,000 more people out of work. 
Salaries for airplane inspectors and air traffic controllers come from other funds. But the F.A.A. had to stop paying 40 airport inspectors, who continue -- incredibly and thankfully -- to do their jobs.
And why is this happening? Republicans, who are experts at such maneuvers, have been holding the reauthorization of the F.A.A. hostage for months, trying to get Democrats in the Senate to agree to weaken transportation workers' rights.
The tale, like so much in Washington, is a convoluted one, but it comes down to this: Last year, the National Mediation Board changed a rule to make it easier for airline and railroad workers to unionize with a straight majority vote. At the behest of the airlines, House Republicans inserted a provision in the F.A.A. reauthorization bill to undo the rule change. The Senate's version kept the rule.
With the two chambers unable to agree, Congress would normally have passed a temporary extension for the F.A.A. (a routine vote that has happened 20 times since 2007). But, last month, the House Republicans inserted a provision to end $16.5 million in federal subsidies to keep airports open in 13 rural communities.
Both parties agree subsidies must be cut. But the list, Democrats note, was written in a way to hit airports in the states of prominent Senate Democrats, including Majority Leader Harry Reid. Representative John Mica, the chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, announced publicly that the subsidy issue was ''just a tool'' to get the Senate to give in on the union issue.
Before leaving Washington on Tuesday, Senate Democrats tried to find a way to extend the F.A.A.'s authority until Sept. 30 -- including proposing an extension bill that included a broader plan to trim subsidies to rural airports. They were blocked by Senate Republicans. Unless the vacationing Congress takes extraordinary action, nothing will change until after Labor Day, at the very least.
By then, the extortion will have cost the government around $1 billion. Thousands of people will have gone without a paycheck for at least four more weeks. And critical repairs at airports will not have been made. There is no excuse.

HEADLINE: For Strong and Weak, Debt Pressures Rattle Europe: Swiss Wrestle With Musclebound Franc

BYLINE: By LIZ ALDERMAN

 BODY:
GENEVA -- The almighty dollar used to be the world's safest refuge in times of trouble. But what do you do when you are worried about the dollar, as many people are now?
Come to Switzerland.
An avalanche of dollars and euros has been tumbling into this Alpine outpost at record rates, as investors see the franc as a haven from the twin debt crises in the United States and Europe. And the Swiss are not happy about it.
On Wednesday, the typically silent Swiss central bank declared the currency ''massively overvalued'' against the dollar and euro, and unexpectedly cut interest rates in an attempt to weaken the franc. The franc retreated slightly but is still too strong, as far as the Swiss are concerned.
''The franc is like the new gold,'' said a Geneva banker who would give only his first name, Dmitri, insisting on the discretion that is the hallmark of this reserved nation. ''It's crazy and it's all anyone is talking about, in the morning, at lunch, at dinner parties.'' 
It was certainly Topic A at the noon lunch hour recently in Geneva, where Dmitri and other dark-suited bankers had emerged from the doors of Credit Suisse, UBS, Goldman Sachs and many other wealthy banks to perch near the broad expanse of Lake Geneva to chew on grilled fish and the issues of the day.
Switzerland is vaunted as a country that attracts money for its secretive bank accounts and the less savory business of tax evasion. But it is also the home of ''le franc fort,'' a muscular currency long seen as second perhaps only to the dollar because this nation -- unlike some others -- tends to have its finances in order.
Now the Swiss franc is second no more.
Despite the passage at long last of a Washington deal to lift America's debt ceiling, the dollar recently plunged to record lows against the Swiss franc on fears the American economy will slow further.
Even after the Swiss central bank's announcement, the dollar was trading at 77 Swiss centimes, down about a third from the level of a year ago.
The euro has fared little better. As Europe succumbed to its own debt troubles last year, the franc took off against the euro. Now, as the latest European bailout for Greece fails to shield big countries like Italy and Spain from the credit contagion, the franc remains strong against the euro.
Despite the Swiss central bank's Wednesday move, a euro will buy 1.10 Swiss francs -- far less than the 1.38 francs that a euro was worth a year ago.
With the rest of the world so untidy, Switzerland looks pristine. Despite a generous safety net, this tiny nation does not have other onerous expenses, like a big military. Its current account surplus is an enviable 15 percent of gross domestic product, and it has low debt. The economy grew 2.6 percent last year; unemployment is around 3 percent.
Still, while it is easy for Switzerland to lure other people's money, there may be such a thing as too much of it. Even for the Swiss.
The Swiss central bank sought to tamp down demand on Wednesday by narrowing its target band for a key rate, the 3-month Libor, to 0.00-0.25 percent from 0.00-0.75 percent to fight the franc's appreciation.
Authorities declared they ''won't tolerate'' a ''tightening of monetary conditions,'' and would take further steps as necessary to curb the franc's rise.
The cost of fine Swiss-made goods, from watches to precision machinery, has gone from eye-popping to eye-watering, and Swiss companies are warning of peril.
''This is bad for the Swiss economy,'' said Thomas Christen, the chief executive of Lucerne-based Reed Electronics, who has started buying cheaper materials to offset his costs.
Everything from a cup of coffee to a Swiss Alpine ski vacation has been priced to the stretching point or beyond reach for many tourists.
Mark Tompkins and Serena Koenig of Boston were stunned during a recent visit. ''A mixed drink at an average bar,'' Mr. Tompkins said, ''was 18 to 20 Swiss francs'' -- $23 to $25 -- ''so two rounds of drinks for four people was crazy expensive.''
In downtown Geneva, where a phalanx of regal storefronts glitter with diamonds and gold, Jean Loichot said his business from Americans and Europeans had slowed to a trickle.
''In 32 years, I never saw it like this,'' said Mr. Loichot, whose boutique, Jean Loichot & Cie, specializes in TAG Heuer watches. ''And in a few months, it's going to be worse.''
Even one of his longtime European clients, a millionaire with a private jet, recently said he would hold off buying a costly watch until the franc's value becomes more reasonable.
''People have money,'' Mr. Loichot said as a metallic silver Ferrari and a black Bentley purred past. ''They're just not buying.''
Swiss people, on the other hand, are snapping up lots of things -- though not necessarily to the benefit of their nation's economy. On the weekends, Swiss families drive into France to load up on wine, food and other goods at hypermarkets where they can buy with the strong franc.
''The parking lots are filled with Swiss license plates,'' said Keith Rockwell, a spokesman for the World Trade Organization who has witnessed Switzerland's ebbs and flows for more than a decade.
Meanwhile local supermarkets like Coop, whose shelves are stuffed with products made outside Switzerland, are practically empty because shopping is cheaper elsewhere. Worried, the store recently asked the government to investigate why importers were not passing on the savings they were making from buying euro-priced goods.
Newspapers regularly lament ''le franc fort,'' and warn that worse is on the way. Last month, when the Tribune de Geneve asked readers in an online poll whether the situation had become ''alarming,'' a majority clicked yes.
''We are in the stratosphere at this point,'' Yves Bonzon, the chief investment officer of Pictet & Cie, a private Geneva-based wealth management bank, said of the currency. He estimates the hit to the economy is the same as if the Swiss central bank had jacked up interest rates to 7 percent from 1 percent.
When the franc first started to surge during the global financial crisis, the Swiss central bank, which manages the currency, fell into a mild panic. It blew 19 billion francs between 2009 and last year in a failed strategy to keep the currency in line. (The bank lost an additional 10.8 billion francs on foreign exchange holdings in the first six months of this year.)
On Wednesday, the bank steered clear of intervention but indicated it was ready to do more.
''There seems to be a consensus that probably the Swiss franc should be more like 1.30 or 1.40 toward the euro,'' rather than near parity, Walter Meier, the spokesman for the central bank said last week. ''But history has shown that these periods of valuation can remain for quite a long time.''
While there has always been a silent Swiss schadenfreude about not joining the European Union, some politicians here have even called lately for pegging the franc to the euro. Still, no one really seems to have ideas for action, aside from hoping that Europe and the United States get their houses in order.
''That would be the most desirable scenario, but we don't build hope on that,'' Mr. Meier said. ''You just have to be prepared for the worst, and if it gets better, you'll take it.''

HEADLINE: Leadership Not in the Detroit Mold Helped Guide Fuel Decision, Says Chrysler Chief

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

 BODY:
TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. -- New leadership from outside Detroit was a deciding factor in the Big Three automakers' acceptance of strict new fuel-economy standards, the chief executive of Chrysler said Wednesday.
In past battles over gas-mileage requirements, the Detroit car companies argued that big increases in fuel-efficiency would be too expensive and cost jobs.
But last week's accord between the Obama administration and carmakers to reach an average of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025 showed how times, and senior executives, have changed in Detroit. 
''These are business people who did not grow up and become conditioned to doing business in Detroit,'' Sergio Marchionne, the head of Chrysler and its parent company, the Italian automaker Fiat, said at an industry conference here. ''They accept the challenge of the new without being afraid.''
Mr. Marchionne, who has dual Italian and Canadian citizenship, took over the top spot at Chrysler when it emerged from its government-sponsored bankruptcy two years ago.
Similarly, the chief executive of General Motors, Daniel F. Akerson, joined the company from the Carlyle Group private equity firm after G.M. came out of Chapter 11. And at Ford, Alan R. Mulally was recruited from the aircraft manufacturer Boeing in 2006 to bring a fresh perspective to the automaker's top ranks.
The three executives, Mr. Marchionne said, were not hamstrung by the litany of past protests by Detroit against tougher fuel rules mandated by Washington.
''This industry had a very bad habit of crying wolf,'' he said. ''Sooner or later, somebody is going to call your bluff.''
Mr. Marchionne's observations were echoed by other attendees at the conference sponsored by the Center for Automotive Research, an industry research group, including environmentalists who locked horns with Detroit over fuel-economy in the past.
''It's become really hard for the companies to say they can't achieve these higher standards,'' said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign, a group working to mitigate global warming. ''I endorse Marchionne's truth-telling. These new guys get it.''
Even the United Auto Workers union has shifted course and backed the new fuel rules, rather than bemoaning the potential job losses resulting from government mandates.
Bob King, who was elected the union's president last year, said the U.A.W. was an ''ally with environmentalists'' and that he expected higher mileage rules to create new jobs in Detroit's factories.
''They recognize that if you are adding technology to these vehicles, it should be their members who are doing it,'' said Mr. Becker.
Still, not everyone in Detroit is as embracing of the new fuel rules, which require automakers to improve the efficiency of their cars by 5 percent annually from 2017 to 2025, and trucks by 3.5 percent each year for the first four years of the cycle, then 5 percent annually for the remainder.
''I personally saw it as political engineering,'' said Sean McAlinden, the Center for Automotive Research's chief economist. He said that government agencies were setting fuel targets based on a ''mass of extrapolated exaggerations'' about the gains that new technology could achieve.
But Mr. Marchionne was more in step with the overall sentiment that car companies need to embrace the new standards instead of criticize them.
''Anybody who surrenders 14 years before the date ought not to be in business,'' he said, referring to the 2025 deadline for the new standards.
He said the government regulations could work if they were ''technology neutral'' and not weighted toward developing electric cars or vehicles powered by hydrogen fuel-cells. The new regulations are expected to offer credits for low-emission technologies, but the precise regulations are still being drafted by the government.
Instead, Mr. Marchionne advocated continued, incremental improvements in the internal combustion engine, including the size of engines and improving transmissions.
He cited the mileage improvements made on Chrysler's new 300 full-size sedan. That sedan has a smaller V-6 engine than earlier models and a new eight-speed transmission, and its mileage has improved from 27 miles a gallon to 31 miles a gallon in the 2012 model, he said.
''The power-train guys are an incredible pool of talent,'' he said. ''Let them do their jobs.''
That view was shared by G.M. executive Charlie Klein, who leads a team of engineers responsible for meeting the new fuel-efficiency rules.
Mr. Klein said in a presentation that G.M. was stepping up work on existing technologies, including direct-injection engines, improved aerodynamic designs, and fuel management systems like engines that shut down when stopped and reactivate when the driver presses the accelerator.
Improving fuel economy is, he said, an open-ended quest that was hardly worth fighting over anymore. ''It's here to stay,'' he said. ''We might as well get used to it.''

HEADLINE: Questioning A Corzine Move

BYLINE: By ANTONY CURRIE, AGNES T. CRANE and ROB COX

 BODY:
Jon Corzine makes no secret of the fact that politics is his passion. Now buyers of debt in MF Global, the firm he runs, are set to get a boost if the former Democratic politico and Goldman Sachs chief should leave the broker-dealer to decamp to Washington.
Investors will get an extra one percentage point of interest on the firm's $300 million bond deal. That might sound encouraging. After all, bondholder activism is worthy of encouragement. But this key man clause seems to benefit Mr. Corzine's image more than creditors. 
Sure, if Mr. Corzine abandons his new post, it would be a setback for the firm. His name has lent credence to the drive to turn MF Global, a business spun off from the scandal-hit Refco, into a broader trading and even investment bank. His predecessor, Bernie Dan, was, like the firm itself, a dyed-in-the-wool futures specialist.
So shareholders would naturally be distressed to see Mr. Corzine depart. But it wouldn't constitute a major credit event. A few senior bankers might leave and earnings might fall for a quarter or two. But it's hard to see how one executive's departure for another, noncompeting job would undermine a firm's creditworthiness.
But let's assume it did. In that unlikely event, bondholders would share among them an extra $3 million a year. That hardly constitutes adequate recompense for increased risk. What's more, if lenders really are concerned about the consequences of Mr. Corzine's departure, they should be insisting on a clause in the debt deal that covers every eventuality, not just the possibility that President Obama might ask him to run the Treasury Department, which is what the deal document essentially implies.
Mr. Corzine's links to both Goldman and the troubled finances of New Jersey, where he was most recently governor, could make for a tough Senate confirmation . The Corzine covenant is at least good public relations for MF Global and its boss. But as protection for bondholders, it's pretty much meaningless.
Bowles for Treasury?
Congress has reached a deal to temporarily avoid default. That gives the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, an opportunity should he wish to step down. What's more, the debt deal's contours suggest a potentially ideal successor: Erskine Bowles.
That's not a name to warm the hearts of the liberal establishment. After all, Mr. Bowles was the co-chairman, with former Republican Senator Alan Simpson, of the commission set up by President Obama that last year called for painful cuts in discretionary spending and reforms to entitlements like Social Security to help right America's fiscal ship.
But if the politics could be overcome, Mr. Bowles is a nearly perfect candidate to take the job. The borrowing and cost-cutting deal signed into law by the president on Tuesday forces legislators to return to the drawing board in just a few months to consider ways to reduce America's debt and close its fiscal deficit. They needn't look much further than the recommendations Mr. Bowles put his name on last December.
True, many of these are going to be political hot potatoes, such as the idea of scrapping the tax deduction for home mortgage interest. But Democrats will need a credible, and confirmable, interlocutor with Republicans to push through any changes that might resemble tax increases. Mr. Bowles's work on the fiscal commission, which recommended some revenue-raising measures alongside expense cuts, gives him some standing.
He can point to his hands-on role as former President Clinton's chief of staff during the economy's most recent golden years. From 1996 to 1998, when he served as the White House's enforcer, the nation's gross domestic product grew at a healthy clip, including a few quarters where the economy expanded at an annualized rate of more than 7 percent.
As a result, Uncle Sam's finances swung from a now quaint-sounding $107 billion deficit to a surplus. And all this happened, as Mr. Bowles would be sure to remind Republicans at the bargaining table, with higher marginal income tax rates than today.
The president snubbed Mr. Bowles when the commission he helped lead revealed its ideas last December. Offering him the Treasury job, however tricky politically, would be one way to make it up to him.

HEADLINE: City Campaign Seeks to Lift Young Black and Latino Men

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO and FERNANDA SANTOS

 BODY:
The administration of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, in a blunt acknowledgment that thousands of young black and Latino men are cut off from New York's civic, educational and economic life, plans to spend nearly $130 million on far-reaching measures to improve their circumstances.
The program, the most ambitious policy push of Mr. Bloomberg's third term, would overhaul how the government interacts with a population of about 315,000 New Yorkers who are disproportionately undereducated, incarcerated and unemployed.
To pay for the endeavor in a time of fiscal austerity, the city is relying on an unusual source: Mr. Bloomberg himself, who intends to use his personal fortune to cover about a quarter of the cost, city officials said. A $30 million contribution from Mr. Bloomberg's foundation would be matched by that of a fellow billionaire, George Soros, a hedge fund manager, with the remainder being paid for by the city.
Starting this fall, the administration said it would place job-recruitment centers in public-housing complexes where many young black and Latino men live, retrain probation officers in an effort to reduce recidivism, establish new fatherhood classes and assess schools on the academic progress of male black and Latino students. 
Mr. Bloomberg plans to announce the three-year program in a speech on Thursday morning in Manhattan, in which he will declare that ''blacks and Latinos are not fully sharing in the promise of American freedom.''
Even as crime has fallen and graduation rates have risen in New York over the past decade, city officials said that black and Latino men, especially those between ages 16 and 24, remained in crisis by nearly every measure, including rates of arrest, school suspension and poverty.
Although the populations of young white, black and Latino men in New York are roughly the same size, 84 percent of those in the city's detention facilities and nearly all of those admitted to children's and family services facilities are black and Latino youth, according to data from the Bloomberg administration. ''The magnitude of the disparities is stunning,'' said Linda I. Gibbs, the deputy mayor for health and human services. ''It's tragic.''
Mr. Bloomberg has put the weight of city government behind large-scale social change before, with public-health campaigns against smoking, sugary beverages and fatty foods.
But now, he is confronting a problem whose intractability and deep-seated causes have bedeviled policy makers for decades. And by focusing so heavily on a subset of city residents, he risks angering those unlikely to be helped by the new resources.
''The success rate, in general, is not that promising,'' said Elijah Anderson, a professor of sociology at Yale, who has written extensively about urban issues.
The challenge, Professor Anderson said, will be persuading New York's businesses to embrace these young men and offer them permanent employment after the city's work is completed. ''Companies have to be much more receptive to these young people and meet people like Bloomberg halfway,'' he said.
The administration's plan, developed after a year of study and debate, spans much of the city's bureaucracy and multiple stages in the lives of the men it is trying to reach, beginning in middle school and ending with career counseling.
In interviews, aides to the mayor said the new measures emphasized the practical needs of the city's most impoverished black and Latino men, many of whom are unable or unwilling to enroll in time-consuming education and training programs unless they are compensated, according to the officials.
So to promote remedial math and literacy classes in the morning, for example, the city would link them with paid internships in the afternoon. The internships would pay $7.25 an hour, but students would be paid only if they participated in the class.
''Working is a big motivator for these kids,'' said Kristin Morse, the director of programs and evaluation at the city's Center for Economic Opportunity.
For the first time, the Education Department would specifically tie the success of black and Latino boys -- measured in part by test scores and graduation rates -- to the grades the city gives schools each year. Those grades can determine whether a school remains open.
Much of the program is intended to prevent young men from entering or returning to the criminal justice system, which has long been a revolving door for many black and Latino youth.
Under the plan, the city's Probation Department would open five satellite probation offices in neighborhoods with the highest crime rates -- like East New York, Brooklyn; Jamaica, Queens; and the South Bronx -- and inside community organizations that offer services from which the young men might benefit, like computer classes to help them prepare for a job or yoga classes to help them control anger. Currently, the city's 524 probation officers work out of central offices in the five boroughs, often disconnected from the communities where the men whom they monitor spend most of their time.
To provide role models for the men on probation, the city said it would recruit from those neighborhoods 900 paid mentors, many of whom used to be troubled themselves, and promote a range of community service programs, like cleaning parks, removing graffiti and painting community centers, said Vincent N. Schiraldi, the city's probation commissioner. He said the goal was to help New Yorkers see these young men ''not as the scary guy in a North Face jacket hanging at the corner, but as men who can have a positive impact in their neighborhoods.''
Aides to the mayor described several of the measures as common-sense solutions that would cost little, if anything, to put in place. The city will try to reduce the barriers to employment for men with criminal convictions by instructing managers not to ask job applicants about those records in the first stage of the interview process.
The city would also encourage men to obtain driver's licenses or state identification cards, after focus groups suggested that a large number of young black and Latino men did not have them, making it difficult for them to apply for jobs. ''They didn't know why they should have it or how to get it,'' said Andrea Batista Schlesinger, a special adviser to the mayor, who organized the program.
Now the city plans to promote such identification in the paperwork given to high-school graduates and during interviews for summer jobs with city agencies.
Mr. Bloomberg urged his aides to study the experiences of black and Latino men in 2010. The aides said he was especially surprised and unsettled by statistics showing how frequently many of the men returned to the city's prisons -- an issue that became personal for the mayor after a stranger pulled him aside on the subway and told him his story: he was 45, black, a convict and unemployed. Mr. Bloomberg asked Dennis M. Walcott, now the schools chancellor, to check in periodically with the man, who was later arrested again.
A few weeks ago, Mr. Bloomberg called Mr. Soros, who has spent millions of dollars on programs to help black men in Baltimore and other cities, and invited him to lunch. The mayor asked the financier to match his donation for a program in New York, and Mr. Soros quickly agreed.
''When the mayor approached us,'' Mr. Soros said, ''he was knocking on an open door.''

HEADLINE: Rivals in G.O.P. Struggle to Woo Bush's Donors

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE; Kitty Bennett, Griff Palmer and Micah Cohen contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The calls come at least once a week these days, with growing urgency: friends of the Republican presidential candidates, aides to the candidates, and often the candidates themselves, wondering if Al Hoffman Jr. might be ready to lend a hand.
''How are you doing? What are you feeling? What are you thinking?'' Mr. Hoffman, a Florida real estate developer who was a co-chairman of George W. Bush's presidential campaigns, said in describing the calls. But Mr. Hoffman, one of the Republican Party's most sought-after fund-raisers, remains unconvinced that he should tap into his extensive network of contacts to raise money for any of them.
''None of the candidates have instantly identified themselves as a leader for the Republican movement,'' Mr. Hoffman said. ''The Bush family were instantly identifiable as leaders.'' 
He is far from alone. Two and a half years after Mr. Bush left the White House, the formidable network of Republican donors he assembled has largely melted away. Fewer than one in five of Mr. Bush's Rangers and Pioneers, the elite corps of ''bundlers'' who helped Mr. Bush smash fund-raising records in his two runs for the White House and remain the gold standard of Republican fund-raising, have contributed to any of the current Republican candidates, according to a New York Times analysis.
Their absence underscores the challenges facing the Republican Party in what could prove to be a protracted primary campaign followed by a hugely expensive general election matchup against an incumbent president.
No Republican candidate for president this year has yet shown the kind of broad appeal that rapidly drew the party's donor establishment to Mr. Bush early in his first run, with only Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, raising enough money in the early going to assure being competitive through this year.
In an economy that has drained pocketbooks and inhibited the emergence of a younger class of wealthy donors, no Republican candidate has yet been able to seize the imagination and loyalty of a new generation of financial supporters. While the eventual nominee will have an opportunity to unite donors now dispersed among the sprawling primary field and benefit from the pools of money backing conservative causes, none of the candidates have yet assembled the kind of big-check network that could be confident of keeping up with the fund-raising machine built by President Obama.
And some large bundlers, unsatisfied with the presidential field, are choosing to place their bets with the party's Congressional wing or with independent expenditure groups, which offer them the ease of writing a single check instead of the grinding work of wrangling contributions from dozens of friends and business associates.
''Nobody is inheriting any kind of apparatus left over from the Bushes at all,'' said Ray Washburne, a Dallas entrepreneur and former Bush Ranger who is backing Tim Pawlenty, the former Minnesota governor. ''Everything's going to have to be recreated. There are new players who want to play, and there are other people tired and done.''
More of Mr. Bush's former supporters could still emerge later in the race or after the party settles on a nominee, as many Rangers and Pioneers did for Senator John McCain of Arizona, the nominee in 2008. Some may be awaiting the entry into the presidential race of Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, though some longtime Bush supporters said there was relatively little overlap between Mr. Bush's network of financial supporters and the one built by Mr. Perry, a powerhouse fund-raiser in his own right.
And no fund-raising machine exists in perpetuity: Large networks of bundlers are built first and foremost on the personal loyalty to specific candidates.
''I tried to retire last time, and I really put my foot down this time,'' said Bradford M. Freeman, a financier who led Mr. Bush's California finance team and was among the top bundlers for Mr. McCain. ''I was a very close personal friend with President Bush. It was a labor of love.''
Some Republicans suggested the Bush fund-raising machine rested on circumstances that would be hard for other candidates to replicate. As the governor of Texas, the son of a former president and brother of a Florida governor, Mr. Bush could tap into three of the party's most robust networks of supporters. In his first campaign, Mr. Bush ran during an economic boom and after eight years of a Democratic administration loathed by his party; during his second, as an incumbent during wartime.
''We put together a fund-raising team that was pretty dang good,'' said James B. Francis Jr., a Texan who organized the Pioneer network during Mr. Bush's first run but has not signed on with any of the current Republican candidates. ''But it's not monolithic. And obviously, when you have a completely different field, and George Bush is not in the race, people are going to go in different directions.''
The fragmentation of Mr. Bush's donor network also reflects a lull in the Bush dynasty. Mr. Bush left office in 2009; his brother, Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, in 2007. No family member currently holds elective office, and the closest thing to a Bush campaign in politics today is Maverick PAC, co-founded by George P. Bush, the former president's nephew, to organize Republican young professionals.
''The day the 2004 campaign was over, you got a tie, and that was it,'' Mr. Washburne said.
Those of Mr. Bush's former top operatives still working in politics are scattered around research organizations, lobby shops and independent expenditure groups, some of which are proving attractive for Republican donors eager to have an impact in the presidential race but unwilling to pick a candidate yet.
A. Jerrold Perenchio, the billionaire founder of Univision, was a Bush Pioneer in 2004 and a national finance chairman of Mr. McCain's 2008 campaign. Mr. Perenchio has not yet donated to any of the Republican candidates, but in April a trust he controls donated $2 million to American Crossroads, a so-called Super PAC founded by Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's former adviser.
Some Bush alumni said they believed many former Bush donors had decided to cast their lots with Mr. Rove early in the cycle, rather than with the still-fluctuating Republican field.
''I don't think the Rangers and Pioneers aren't playing, I think they are playing in a new way,'' said Mark McKinnon, a former Bush strategist. ''My guess is that many of them have determined their money is much better invested and spent in the Super PACs. A lot of them know and trust Karl Rove to give them a good bang for their buck. So that's where their bucks are going.''
Mr. Bush's Rangers and Pioneers are still a prized commodity in Republican presidential politics, their allegiance avidly sought by most of the candidates and -- once won -- quietly advertised to other potential supporters as evidence of viability and establishment support.
Of those Bush bundlers still active in politics, Mr. Romney appears to have drawn the most big names, among them the financier Lewis M. Eisenberg, H. Gary Morse, a Florida real estate developer, and Sam Fox, a former ambassador to Belgium.
Their support has helped Mr. Romney lap the Republican competition: during the three months ending June 30, he raised $18.25 million, four times more than any other candidate.

HEADLINE: For Obama, Turning 50, It's Happy Fund-Raising

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
CHICAGO -- For many men, turning 50 can be a day of reckoning, marked by graying hair, a slowing step and the wistful recognition that you are probably never going to make it to the corner office. What could be better, at such a melancholy moment, than to celebrate at home, among old friends?
But if you are already in the corner office, and it's oval, you get to celebrate your 50th at a fund-raiser in a Chicago ballroom, with Jennifer Hudson singing ''Happy Birthday,'' Herbie Hancock jamming and 100 ''friends'' paying $35,800 a plate to commiserate over dinner, while bankrolling your bid to keep your job. 
''It is true that I turn 50 tomorrow,'' President Obama told the raucous hometown crowd, ''which means that by the time I wake up, I'll have an e-mail from A.A.R.P., asking me to call President Obama and tell him to protect Medicare.''
For Mr. Obama, just about any place would be better than where he spent the last month of his 40s -- pinned down in the wet-blanket heat of Washington, fighting over health care benefits and tax breaks for corporate jets with an insurgent band of House Republicans eager to paint him as a liberal fossil.
The fund-raiser was Mr. Obama's first overtly political event since the deal over the debt ceiling was reached, and he threw a few jabs that offered a preview of his line of attack on the Republicans as Washington catches its breath and girds for another round of debate over how to cut the towering federal debt.
''I hope we can avoid another self-inflicted wound like the one we just saw over the last couple of weeks,'' he said, ''because we don't have time to play these partisan games. We've got too much work to do.''
Mr. Obama warned Democrats that the United States did need to get its fiscal house in order. But he added, ''Economic growth, making ourselves more competitive, isn't just about cutting programs.''
For the most part, though, the mood was celebratory. Mr. Obama was introduced by Chicago's mayor, Rahm Emanuel -- his former chief of staff -- who praised the president's role in bailing out the auto industry.
''When it comes to doing what's right for the country, he never takes the easy road,'' Mr. Emanuel said, adding with a twinkle, ''I can tell you that because I first came to tell him to take the easy road.''
For the Obama campaign, the fund-raiser will help make up for a lost month, when the White House was forced to cancel several events featuring the president because of the debt talks. Obama campaign officials said they expected to raise significantly less money in the third quarter than in the second quarter, when Mr. Obama raised $86 million, far more than any Republican candidate.
Mr. Obama, whose youth and relative inexperience were used against him in the 2008 election, has aged visibly, most noticeably in his hair color, now less salt-and-pepper than a generous dusting of salt. After two and a half years in which he soldiered through the Great Recession and sent a Seal team to assassinate Osama bin Laden, this president stopped seeming young a long time ago.
Yet he can take solace in the fact that he is still younger than any of the Republicans who have declared their candidacy for his job. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota, who turned 50 last November, comes close. But Michele Bachmann is 55, while Mitt Romney, who sent his birthday wishes in the form of a video lambasting the president for letting down everybody who believed in him, is 64.
When asked before a cabinet meeting on Wednesday whether he was ''ready for 5-0,'' Mr. Obama, seated between Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta, 73, and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, 63, joked that he was going to ask his cabinet members for advice on ''how to handle this milestone.''
It is not clear what kind of an answer he would get from Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, who turns 50 this month and has been pleading with the president to release him so can he can go home to New York, where his son is beginning his last year of high school. (Now it looks more likely that he will stay.)

HEADLINE: Indian Pt. May Enlist Giuliani as Defender

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN and DANNY HAKIM; Nicholas Confessore contributed reporting.

 BODY:
This has been a tough year for the long-beleaguered Indian Point nuclear plant. In January, a longtime critic, Andrew M. Cuomo, was sworn in as governor, and proceeded to push for the facility to be shuttered because of its proximity to New York City and its susceptibility to earthquakes and terrorist attacks. Then, in March, a tsunami precipitated a reactor meltdown in Japan, stoking new fears about the safety of nuclear power plants, especially those near population centers.
Now, Indian Point's owners, confronted by that intensified political opposition and public unease, are preparing a public relations campaign. And, seeking a way to counteract the determined governor, they are turning for help to a tough-talking former New York mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani.
The Entergy Corporation, the operator of the two reactors at Indian Point, which generate as much as 30 percent of New York City's power, has been in talks with Mr. Giuliani about headlining a major advertising campaign aimed at allaying public concerns about the facility's safety. The campaign would effectively pit Mr. Giuliani, an erstwhile Republican presidential candidate, against the governor, a Democrat. 
Entergy officials said the campaign was still in the planning stages and could include television commercials. A company spokesman, James F. Steets, would not elaborate on discussions with Mr. Giuliani, who has done promotional work for Entergy in the past.
''We think he's a great voice for Indian Point,'' Mr. Steets said. ''He has been very supportive of the plants because he understands they're safe and secure, and as mayor he knows how important it is to have a reliable source of energy for the city.''
A spokeswoman for Mr. Giuliani's consulting business, Giuliani Partners, declined to comment for this article, and it remained unclear whether Mr. Giuliani and Entergy had reached an agreement.
An advertising campaign would be the most visible sign yet of Entergy's concern that Mr. Cuomo and other opponents pose a serious threat to the future of the plant, which sits 35 miles north of Midtown Manhattan in Buchanan.
The original 40-year operating licenses for Indian Point's reactors expire in 2013 and 2015, and Entergy is asking the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to extend them for 20 years. Mr. Cuomo has vowed to lobby federal regulators to deny the extensions, and one of the governor's top aides met with representatives from Entergy in June and emphasized that Mr. Cuomo was determined to shut down the plant, a blunt message that startled company officials.
The state's attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, has also emerged as an obstacle. Since January, he has repeatedly written to federal regulators raising concerns about safety and security at Indian Point.
Entergy also faces considerable public misgivings. According to a Siena College poll conducted in March, 72 percent of registered voters in New York State were concerned about the safety of the state's nuclear plants, which include three active facilities upstate, in addition to Indian Point.
''I would imagine this has their full attention,'' Paul T. Ridzon, an analyst for KeyBanc Capital Markets, said of Entergy. ''I think if they spend a few million dollars on a campaign, it would certainly be money well spent, because the plant is very profitable.''
The reactors at Indian Point have a capacity of more than 2,000 megawatts -- or about 41 percent of the capacity of Entergy's wholesale nuclear power business. Entergy's nuclear division generated $489 million in income last year, or 39 percent of the company's earnings.
Indian Point has its share of backers, including Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who has questioned whether it would be possible to close the plant anytime soon, given the large share of the city's energy it provides.
But in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Entergy routinely discloses the risk of ''possible shutdown of nuclear generating facilities,'' and in an earnings conference call on Tuesday, the company's chief executive, J. Wayne Leonard, acknowledged the difficult landscape. ''We believe the arguments for license renewal are very strong, and they're supported by the facts,'' he said.
He added, ''We are very early in the process, and as these things typically unfold, sometimes things get better.''
Analysts said that investors had taken note of Mr. Cuomo's tough stance toward Indian Point's relicensing. ''It's an uncertainty,'' said Michael Worms, an analyst for BMO Capital Markets, ''and one thing Wall Street does not like is uncertainties.''
In recent months, proponents of nuclear power have employed advertising and public relations campaigns to emphasize plant safety in the wake of the meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan. The industry's trade association, the Nuclear Energy Institute, has retooled its advertising -- which is directed at Washington-area policy makers -- to strike a reassuring tone.
''Given the images on TV in the spring, that's not surprising,'' said Steve Kerekes, a spokesman for the Nuclear Energy Institute. ''We recognize that right now people want to understand what we do at our facilities to ensure safety.''
Entergy, which is also facing a difficult relicensing battle for Vermont Yankee, a smaller nuclear plant it operates just south of Brattleboro, has adopted a similar strategy. For years, the company has maintained a Web site for Indian Point that emphasizes its safety features and promotes its economic impact in Westchester County. Its tag line is ''Safe. Secure. Vital.''
In March, the company placed advertisements in New York newspapers in which Mr. Leonard warned that opponents of nuclear power would try to ''use the crisis in Japan to escalate the fears of the public in order to further their longstanding goals of closing Indian Point.''
And last week Mr. Steets, the Entergy spokesman, said the company was now seeking to call further attention to Indian Point's safety features.
''A lot's been said about what could happen post-Japan, and we have an important message,'' he said. ''It's really about reassuring people. And we want as favorable an environment as possible for the relicensing. You don't want people to be afraid of the plant.''
For Entergy, a carefully planned public relations campaign would not be without precedent. About a year and a half after Sept. 11, 2001, amid concerns about Indian Point's potential vulnerability to a terrorist attack, the company hired Giuliani Partners to consult on emergency planning and security.
And when Entergy formally announced in 2006 that it would seek to operate Indian Point's two active reactors beyond their initial 40-year licenses, it again enlisted Mr. Giuliani's support. He called Indian Point ''as safe as a facility can be.''

HEADLINE: Pressured by White House, Treasury Secretary Is Expected to Stay at Post

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary and dean of President Obama's economic team, is expected to stay through the president's term after intense White House pressure, according to officials familiar with the discussions.
But Mr. Geithner has not yet notified the White House of his intentions, and family considerations could still win out, advisers say. 
Speculation from Washington to Wall Street has intensified because Mr. Geithner, the only holdover at the center of Mr. Obama's original economic circle, said a month ago that he would decide on his future after the White House and Congress reached a deal to increase the nation's debt ceiling. Mr. Obama signed that deal into law on Tuesday.
Mr. Obama and his chief of staff, William M. Daley, have been urging Mr. Geithner to stay, administration officials say, not only for continuity when the economy has weakened and to avoid an all-but-certain confirmation fight in the Senate over a successor, but also because Mr. Obama has developed a close rapport with Mr. Geithner.
Whether the president persuades Mr. Geithner to stay will be a central development for the White House as it girds for a re-election race expected to turn on the economy and the continuing battle of the budget with Republicans.
Mr. Geithner has been considering an exit since early this year, administration officials say. None would speak directly on what Mr. Obama has said to his Treasury secretary because the two men have private meetings alone once a week.
On Monday, after the previous night's announcement of the debt accord, Mr. Geithner convened advisers to talk about his future agenda, including dealing with the European debt crisis, housing and overhauling the corporate tax code. Aides say they took that as a clue he was staying, only to wonder on Tuesday, when a photographer came in to capture Mr. Geithner watching the final vote for the debt deal, if the photos were intended as a record of Mr. Geithner's final days.
Especially in recent weeks, the issue has become a running joke, officials say: Mr. Geithner and Mr. Daley tease about the ankle bracelet that the White House makes him wear, or Mr. Geithner asks if Mr. Daley has yet read his resignation letter, to which Mr. Daley answers in unprintable language.
But the pressure from the top on Mr. Geithner was more serious one day about two weeks ago, officials say. Mr. Daley has also told Mr. Geithner's top lieutenants -- Deputy Secretary Neal S. Wolin and Mark A. Patterson, the chief of staff -- that he wants them to remain, though Jake Siewert, Mr. Geithner's counselor, is returning to New York as soon as this week.
Neither Mr. Geithner nor Mr. Daley would comment. ''I haven't made that decision yet,'' Mr. Geithner said Tuesday in an interview with ABC. He added, ''We've got a lot of challenges, president's got a lot of challenges, and, you know, I got other pressures on me, too.''
Chief among those pressures are his family. Mr. Geithner's wife and son moved back to New York in June so his son could complete high school there. And Mr. Geithner has been working at a breakneck pace since the early days of the financial crisis in 2007. Formerly president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, he has been among the three top stewards of the economy, along with Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, and the Bush administration Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson.
''He's had a tough job during a tough time, and I think he's really slogged through and made some really tough choices,'' said Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia. ''I can understand why he might want to cash it in.''
But, he added, ''My fear is not only who would you get that would have the experience to grapple with another crisis but also, do we really need a massive confirmation fight?''
From the start, Mr. Geithner's biggest critics have been on the left. But Jared Bernstein, a former member of the administration's economic team and a liberal economist close to some of the critics, said: ''To the extent people vilify Tim as only caring about banks, they're way off. He's always understood that Main Street depends on credit from Wall Street, and I know for a fact that he advocated the steps we took for that reason, not to preserve anyone's capital or profits. I've actually heard him say some pretty nasty stuff about those guys.''
The prospects of being drawn into an election-year confirmation brawl could deter some who might be considered as Mr. Geithner's successor. Among those named by people familiar with administration thinking are Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase; Jeffrey R. Immelt, the chairman of General Electric and of Mr. Obama's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness; Roger Altman, a deputy Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration; and Erskine Bowles, a former White House chief of staff to President Bill Clinton and co-chairman of Mr. Obama's fiscal commission in 2010.
Some Democrats say Mr. Bowles might be one of the few people who could surmount the opposition of Senate Republicans, given his good relations with some of them after his work on the bipartisan fiscal commission. ''In rational times, absolutely'' Mr. Bowles would be confirmed, Mr. Warner said. ''But I'm not sure we're in rational times.''

HEADLINE: Seeking Balance On Mideast

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
Congress periodically showcases the warts of democracy, occasionally even the deformities and disfigurements, and it might seem difficult to top the latest debt ceiling horrors. But there's one area where Congress has been even more obstructionist: the Middle East.
Next month, Palestinians are expected to seek statehood at the United Nations. It's a stunt that won't accomplish much for anybody, but it's more constructive than throwing rocks at Israeli cars -- or, on the Israeli side, better than expanding illegal settlements. A prominent Israeli politician, Isaac Herzog, has shrewdly suggested that Israel actually offer, with conditions, to vote in favor of Palestinian statehood at the United Nations. 
Yet the American House of Representatives voted 407 to 6 to call on the Obama administration to use its diplomatic capital to try to block the initiative, while also threatening to cut the Palestinians' funding if they proceeded to seek statehood.
Similarly, when Israel stormed into Gaza in 2008 to halt rocket attacks, more than 1,300 Gazans were killed, along with 13 Israelis, according to B'Tselem, a respected Israeli human rights group. As Gazan blood flowed, the House, by a vote of 390 to 5, hailed the invasion as ''Israel's right to defend itself.''
Such Congressional tomfoolery bewilders our friends and fritters away our international capital. It also encourages the intransigence of the Israeli government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and reduces the chance of a peace settlement.
In the last few years, a former government official named Jeremy Ben-Ami has been trying to change the political dynamic in Washington with a new organization -- J Street -- that presses Congress and the White House to show more balance. Ben-Ami has just published a book, ''A New Voice for Israel,'' that is a clarion call for American reasonableness in the Middle East.
''If things don't change pretty soon, chances are that the two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will slip through our fingers,'' Ben-Ami writes. ''As that happens, the dream of the Jewish people to be a free people in their own land also slowly disappears.''
Ben-Ami, who worked in Bill Clinton's White House, comes from a long line of Zionists, and his ancestors helped found Tel Aviv. But he's aghast at the way the United States is enabling hard-line Israeli policies that make peace less likely.
American Jews have long trended liberal, and President Obama won 78 percent of the Jewish vote in 2008. Yet major Jewish organizations, like the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or Aipac, embrace hawkish positions.
That's because those Jews who vote and donate based on Israel are disproportionately conservative (the same is true of Christians who are most passionate about Israel issues). Ben-Ami argues that ''the loudest eight percent'' have hijacked Jewish groups to press for policies that represent neither the Jewish mainstream nor the best interests of Israel.
Some see this influence of Jewish organizations on foreign policy as unique and sinister, but Congress often surrenders to loudmouths who have particular foreign policy grievances and claim to have large groups behind them. Look at the way extremists in the Cuban-American community have insisted upon sanctions on Cuba that have helped sustain Fidel Castro's rule.
In the case of Israel, American Jewish opinion isn't the monolith that many assume. A 2008 survey by the American Jewish Committee asked Jews what issue they most wanted presidential candidates to discuss. Most cited the economy; only 3 percent said Israel. There's also some evidence that young American Jews are growing disenchanted as Israeli society turns rightward. (Palestinian extremism feeds Israeli extremism, which feeds Palestinian extremism, which feeds. ...)
''What happens as Israel continues to become more religious and conservative, more isolated internationally and less democratic domestically?'' Ben-Ami writes. ''What happens to the relationship between American Jews and Israel as the face of Israel shifts from that of Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres to that of the national religious settlers and the ultra-Orthodox rabbis?''
To put it another way: When Glenn Beck becomes the best friend of Israel's government and is invited to speak to the Knesset, what do liberals do? Some withdraw. Others join leftist groups like Jewish Voice for Peace, which supports divestment campaigns against companies profiting from the occupation of Palestinian territories.
(Whenever I write about Israel, I get accused of double standards because I don't spill as much ink denouncing worse abuses by, say, Syria. I plead guilty. I demand more of Israel partly because my tax dollars supply arms and aid to Israel. I hold democratic allies like Israel to a higher standard -- just as I do the U.S.)
With the Arab Spring, the United States has a chance for a new beginning in the region. But that will require Washington to adopt a more balanced policy. Maybe, just maybe, J Street will help create the political space to enable that to happen.

HEADLINE: Obama Takes Steps to Help Avert Atrocities

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama, looking for ways to strengthen the American response to genocide and other mass atrocities, on Thursday will announce a ban on visas for people who the State Department finds have been involved in human rights violations, White House officials said. 
Mr. Obama will also issue a presidential directive establishing an Atrocities Prevention Board -- made up of officials from the White House, the State Department, the Pentagon and other agencies -- aimed toward forming an early-warning system of potential genocide and other politically driven humanitarian catastrophes. The panel, administration officials say, will also be assigned with coming up with a range of American responses to atrocities.
Decades after the Holocaust and 17 years after the Rwanda genocide, ''the United States still lacks a comprehensive policy framework and a corresponding interagency mechanism for preventing and responding to mass atrocities and genocide,'' according to a fact sheet provided by the White House. ''This has left us ill-prepared to engage early, proactively and decisively to prevent threats from evolving into large-scale civilian atrocities.''
While American law already bars certain human rights violators from the United States, the visa ban will fill in gaps, White House officials said, by expanding the grounds for denying entry to include war crimes, crimes against humanity and other serious human rights violations like prolonged arbitrary detention, forced disappearances, slavery and forced labor.
The addition of prolonged arbitrary detention to the list of violations could prove diplomatically nettlesome as the United States deals with authoritarian governments like China, and it was unclear whether, and how often, the State Department would seek to use the expanded grounds to prevent people from getting visas.
A senior White House official said one reason Mr. Obama wanted to set up the Atrocities Prevention Board was to avoid a situation in which the president is presented with only two options to respond to a mass atrocity: intervening militarily or doing nothing, the official said, as was the case with former President Bill Clinton and the Rwanda genocide.
''Governmental engagement on atrocities and genocide too often arrives too late, when opportunities for prevention or low-cost, low-risk action have been missed,'' a White House statement on the directive said. ''By the time these issues have commanded the attention of senior policy-makers, the menu of options has shrunk considerably and the costs of action have risen.''
Mr. Obama's action comes as American policy makers are struggling to determine how to handle the worsening situation in Syria, where the government of President Bashar al-Assad has engaged in a bloody crackdown on democracy protesters. Mr. Obama is facing intensifying calls to punish Syria more forcefully; a group of senators introduced legislation on Tuesday that would impose even stronger economic sanctions than those already imposed against Mr. Assad and his senior aides.
Mr. Obama has not called publicly for Mr. Assad to resign, nor has he withdrawn the American ambassador to Syria. Administration officials say they plan to expand on sanctions against the Assad government, but have not yet done so.

HEADLINE: Who Will Help the Syrians? Tougher sanctions, and a united front, are the only hope of ending the killing

 BODY:
As many as 1,600 courageous Syrians have been slaughtered since pro-democracy demonstrations began in March. On Wednesday, after three days of shelling, President Bashar al-Assad ordered his military to storm Hama, the city where his father killed up to 20,000 people three decades ago. 
Where has the international community been? Shamefully paralyzed.
On Wednesday, the United Nations Security Council finally issued a statement condemning ''widespread violations of human rights and the use of force against civilians by the Syrian authorities'' -- but with no threat of sanctions. For two months, Russia, China, India, Brazil and South Africa had blocked any action at all. They have allowed Mr. Assad to believe that he can keep killing and pay no price.
The statement, of course, is better than silence. We would like to believe that even this faint change of heart by Moscow -- a longtime military supplier and patron -- will grab Mr. Assad's attention. But we suspect that he will instead focus on how Russia managed to water down the language in a ridiculous bid for evenhandedness.
The Security Council's statement unfairly blames the protesters when it urges ''all sides to act with utmost restraint, and to refrain from reprisals, including attacks against state institutions.'' And it gives Mr. Assad -- who needs to be gone -- a lifeline by urging his government to implement its now thoroughly discredited ''commitments'' to reform.
It is going to take a lot more pressure to persuade Mr. Assad that his time is up -- or to persuade those enabling him to switch sides. The Council needs to impose tough sanctions, including travel bans and asset freezes on Mr. Assad and all of his top aides. It should refer the Syrian leader and his thugs to the International Criminal Court for a war crimes investigation and direct states to halt investment in Syria's government-run energy sector. More dithering will only mean more killings.
The United States and the European Union have done a much better job, although not as clearly and swiftly as needed. They have imposed several rounds of travel bans and asset freezes on Mr. Assad and his henchmen -- Europe added more names to its list on Monday. They need to ratchet up the pressure.
One idea is for the top consumers of Syrian oil -- Germany, Italy, France and the Netherlands -- to stop buying it. The exports are small enough that a suspension would have little effect on world prices but would still have a big impact on Damascus. There should be no new investments in Syria's energy sector.
Turkey, once one of Syria's closest allies and now a critic, needs to use all of its leverage. Washington, the European Union and Turkey should also be pressing the cowardly Arab League to stand with the Syrian people.
On Tuesday, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met Syrian opposition members. Washington and its allies should do all they can to help lay the groundwork for a democratic, post-Assad Syria. Right now, they need to marshal every possible diplomatic and economic pressure to help the Syrian people topple this brutal regime.

HEADLINE: New Jockeying For Next Phase In Budget Fight

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Republicans and Democrats maneuvered for advantage on Wednesday in the next battle over federal spending, trying to influence the choice of members and frame the agenda for a powerful ''supercommittee'' that is supposed to recommend at least $1.5 trillion of additional deficit reduction measures.
A huge fight has already erupted over how to count the costs of extending tax cuts for high-income people, which are due to expire at the end of 2012. Republicans want to extend the tax cuts, but Democrats want the cuts for more affluent people to expire. 
Congressional leaders have two weeks to name panel members. Names of candidates were circulating Wednesday on Capitol Hill, and some lawmakers have been quietly promoting themselves or their friends for spots on the 12-member panel, which will consist of equal numbers of Republicans and Democrats from the House and the Senate.
Lobbyists scrambled Wednesday to figure out how to influence the new panel to protect the programs and tax breaks from which they benefit. Military contractors and health care lobbyists were particularly active, as they have the most to fear.
The panel, known as the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, will have three months, until Nov. 23, to forge an agreement on divisive issues that have defied solution for decades.
The options on the table have been studied by numerous expert panels, including several in the past year. The problem is not so much determining how to align the government's revenues and spending; it is in reaching a compromise on the specific elements of a plan and then finding the political will to enact the necessary spending cuts, tax increases or both.
Congressional leaders say this panel has a better chance than many of its predecessors because the debt deal creates a strong incentive for bipartisan agreement: If the committee fails to agree or to win approval for a plan from the House and the Senate, the government will automatically cut $1.2 trillion over 10 years from hundreds of military and nonmilitary programs, biting deeply into the priorities of both parties.
Medicaid, which finances health care for more than 50 million people, ''is more at risk of significant cuts than any other entitlement,'' said Ellen Nissenbaum, a lobbyist for the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
The composition of the committee will be an early indication of its prospects. Republicans, in particular, are under intense pressure to choose members who will not compromise in their opposition to any deal that involves increased revenues. And members of both parties are interested in overhauling the tax code to eliminate tax breaks and simplify the laws.
Among the Democrats mentioned as possible appointees to the panel are Senators Max Baucus of Montana and Kent Conrad of North Dakota and Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland. Republican candidates include Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, Representative Dave Camp of Michigan and Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, whose earlier budget plan -- since rejected in the Senate -- called for sizable cuts in Medicare's growth.
The panel is expected to consider a wide range of proposals to slow the growth of entitlement programs like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, along with cuts to military spending and ways to raise more revenue.
The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, said members of the panel must have ''open minds.'' The House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi of California, said her appointees would ''fight to protect'' Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Republican leaders indicated they would not appoint anyone willing to raise taxes.
An immediate question on Wednesday was how to measure the impact of changes in tax law.
In estimating the effects of legislative proposals, the Congressional Budget Office says, it usually assumes that current laws remain unchanged. That means that tax cuts from 2001 and 2003 will expire at the end of 2012, with revenues rising rapidly in the next three years.
President Obama's economic policy coordinator, Gene Sperling, said he hoped the joint committee would not use this starting point.
''The budget legislation specifically calls for deficit reduction -- not simply spending cuts -- and does not anywhere require the committee to work off a current law baseline,'' Mr. Sperling said.
Democrats would prefer to start with what they describe as more realistic assumptions: that the tax cuts will continue for middle-income people but end for those with high incomes.
Mr. Ryan, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, fired back. He said Mr. Sperling was trying to pave the way for tax increases by advancing ''a misguided interpretation of the mandate given to this newly created committee.''
In fact, Mr. Ryan said, the new law ''explicitly instructs the committee'' to follow the standard practice of comparing legislative proposals with current law, which he said ''already assumes tax increases after 2012.'' Mr. Sperling said Mr. Ryan's claim was ''simply false.''
Huge sums are at stake. Continuing the tax cuts for middle-income people could cost $2.8 trillion over 10 years. Continuing the cuts for more affluent people -- individuals with annual incomes over $200,000 and couples over $250,000 -- could cost $800 billion.
Mark J. Tavlarides, a vice president of Van Scoyoc Associates, who lobbies on foreign and military policy, said that in dozens of e-mails this week, lobbyists were asking one another, in effect: ''What kind of cuts can we expect? And what do we do about them?''
Geoffrey C. Peterson, a health care lobbyist, said he was trying to figure out whether his clients would fare better in the joint committee or under the automatic cuts. For hospitals, he said, the automatic cuts would probably be ''more benign,'' because Medicaid is exempt and Medicare cannot be cut more than 2 percent.
Another lobbyist, Michael H. Herson, president of American Defense International, said, ''The defense industry is just coming to grips with the new law -- and the prospect of cuts that could have a devastating impact on jobs, manufacturers and national security preparedness.''

HEADLINE: How Democrats Can Win Back Voters

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Stanley R. Greenberg is telling Democrats to be more like ... Democrats (''Why Voters Tune Out Democrats,'' Sunday Review, July 31). Traditional Democrats, that is, the party that gave the nation the New Deal, the grit and courage of Harry S. Truman, and the vision of John F. Kennedy. 
We Democrats should be the party of working people, not of chief executives and boards of directors. We should be the party of Main Street, not Wall Street -- and we need to show, over and over, why one party cannot represent both.
We should be the party of immigrants, and of those who value their immigrant forebears. We should be the party that values education -- not education bureaucracy. We should be the party of people of color, and of whites who know that a more inclusive society will be a more successful society, socially and economically.
Above all, we need the courage to fight for our principles. We should disdain campaign dollars from corporate political action committees and bankers, and stand up for public financing.
Will our opponents seek to drown us with their campaign cash? Yes. But we should relish the fight, confident that in the end truth and honesty will prevail.
JONATHAN J. MARGOLIS Brookline, Mass., July 31, 2011
To the Editor:
Stanley R. Greenberg makes several good observations. Unfortunately, when it comes to solutions, Mr. Greenberg mistakes policy-wonk issues for issues that really matter to voters.
Mr. Greenberg acknowledges that ''many voters prefer the policies of Democrats to the policies of Republicans,'' but they ''just don't trust the Democrats to carry out those promises.''
Allowing tax cuts for the rich to expire and protecting Medicare and Social Security consistently poll well for the Democrats, and voters respond well when they believe that either party makes a priority of tackling unemployment.
So why does Mr. Greenberg offer campaign finance and lobbying reform, along with other issues that primarily appeal to policy wonks, as his strategy to win the confidence of voters who are skeptical that the Democratic Party will fight for them?
People are focused on lost jobs, lost homes and financial insecurity. If the Democrats continue to divert their attention from those concerns, they can forget about winning back the confidence of those who no longer believe that the Democrats will fight for them after Election Day.
MATTHEW HAWKINS Pittsburgh, Aug. 1, 2011
The writer teaches social work at California University of Pennsylvania.
To the Editor:
What Stanley R. Greenberg and other center-left pollsters need to keep in mind is that the voters whom they claim to know how to reach, especially as you look further left on the political spectrum, have a low tolerance for messages that pander.
We've witnessed the increasingly inauthentic posturing of Democrats who are too busy triangulating issues in pursuit of the perfect recipe for electoral success. A result has been the cynicism and fatigue of progressive voters who feel that the leadership has let them down on reversing staggering economic inequity, protecting social programs and pursuing desperately needed financial reform.
If we're truly fortunate, the coming ''liberal'' anger that Mr. Greenberg hopes will invigorate American politics can be channeled into a viable, progressive third-party challenge to our two-party status quo.

HEADLINE: A Brazilian Touch for Comedy Central

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

 BODY:
From its beginnings in the United States, Comedy Central has expanded to become a global presence, with channels in countries like Britain, Poland, Israel and New Zealand. A comedy explosion in Brazil, brought on by ''a new generation of humorists out there who are acid, vibrant and clever,'' will see that cable channel make its debut early next year in its largest overseas market (200 million people) and establish its first foothold in Latin America. Alvaro Paes de Barros, the general manager for Viacom in Brazil, who is supervising the opening of Comedy Central there, talked with Larry Rohter about the new generation of Brazilian comedians, cultural gulfs in humor and how to overcome them. Here are excerpts from that conversation:
Q. Do American styles of humor automatically translate to a society like Brazil? 
A. I don't think so. That's why this channel is going to have a mix, with American and other international product, but also a lot of locally made programming. I can't say yet what the percentage will be, but it's clear that we are a country that, while it looks to the U.S. a lot, is also proud of its own culture. So we have to find a balance between the two.
Q. But you are planning to have both stand-up sessions from the United States and the network's two signature shows there, ''The Daily Show With Jon Stewart'' and ''The Colbert Report''?
A. Yes, both of those and series like ''South Park'' and ''Ugly Americans'' too. They will be subtitled rather than dubbed. The idea is to get everything on the air as quickly as possible, before the joke loses its humor. But we're also going to be hiring some very funny Brazilian writers and editors, some of them famous and some not. We're talking to a lot of people because it's our sense of things that comedy is turning into an industry here.
Q. MTV Brasil has been very successful, but what made Viacom think that it made sense to bring the Comedy Central brand to Brazil?
A. Well, there's a real boom in humor going on here. It's very fashionable, and there's a new generation of comedians who are very sharp and savvy. Plus, the economy is booming, and the market for cable TV is also growing vigorously. So when you add all of that up, and look at our portfolio, we decided that it made good sense to launch Comedy Central here. It's an idea whose time has come.
Q. How would you characterize this new crop of Brazilian comedians?
A. They're a very irreverent group, and fearless. They're not afraid to do social criticism and commentary. Really, they are quite gutsy. And they're very politicized, with their antennas out for the way politics is done here in Brazil, the idiosyncrasies of our particular system. Politics is like a high-octane fuel for comedy. The other thing about this group is that they don't do humor in the traditional way, with sketches or stock phrases. They're focused on stand-up, which is something new for Brazil, and are always dealing with current themes, easily identifiable by the audience.
Q. When did this comedy boom that you're talking about actually start?
A. It's hard to say, but if you want me to pick a point in time, I'd say that it truly started to gain force starting around 2008. For us at Viacom, we've been thinking of this for about a year and a half, and we've done the research that tells us there's an audience for this. It's young, in the age range 24 to 35; it's urban; and it's predominantly male.
Q. What makes you think that particular Brazilian audience is going to be receptive to the American programming that you're going to be offering?
A. Among other things, the example of shows like ''Seinfeld'' and ''Friends.'' Those are programs that initially were directed at one particular market or culture but appeal to an urban, globalized viewing public that has access to cable TV. It's the same thing with ''South Park,'' which has been shown on some other cable channels here. The themes are American, but that young and globalized audience understands what you're talking about and finds the satire to be very humorous.

HEADLINE: Moving China Up the Value Chain

BYLINE: DAVID BARBOZA


HIGHLIGHT: A conversation with Dan Breznitz and Michael Murphree, authors of "Rise of the Red Queen," who say seeking small innovations in manufacturing, not breakthroughs, would be to China's advantage.

 BODY:
SHANGHAI -- In "Run of the Red Queen," a new book about China's innovation drive, Dan Breznitz and Michael Murphree lay out a contrarian view of this country's path. They argue that China should worry less about coming up with breakthrough technologies and focus more on what it already does best: making incremental innovations in everything from manufacturing to logistics. 
The authors, both at the Georgia Institute of Technology - Mr. Breznitz as an associate professor of international affairs and strategic management, and Mr. Murphree as a doctoral candidate - say China has shown strength in process innovation and creating new manufacturing systems. Rather than trapping China in low-end manufacturing, they say, these capabilities will power the Chinese economy for years to come and eventually allow China to move up the value chain.
Indeed, they argue that the Chinese government's push to compete with the United States and Europe on novel ideas and breakthrough products may be wasteful and inefficient, partly because of government interference but also and because China has not yet reached an advanced stage of development. Here are excerpts from an interview with the two authors.
Dan Breznitz: One thing truly important to understanding China is the defining characteristic of today's globalization: the fragmentation of production. Today, places specialize not in specific industries but specific stages or activities within those industries.
In different places -- Taiwan, the U.S., South Korea -- there are different stages of production in each industry. The next logical step in thinking about innovation, since industries are fragmented, is that different places need different systems and different kinds of innovation. China excels in different kinds of process or manufacturing innovation. This includes design for manufacturing, organization of production, sourcing and logistics.China's companies are extremely efficient at creating new versions, often simpler, cheaper and more efficient, of technologies and products shortly after they are invented and marketed elsewhere in the world. For instance, I can't think of any company in the world that can have over 200,000 people in one location producing a wide array of electronic gadgets for multiple companies other than Foxconn in China.
The American military, the best fighting machine in the world, can hardly move 200,000 people into the exact locations it wants them in months, but this company moves engineers and production workers from line to line and product to product with amazing efficiency. This is production innovation. China does innovate.
In novel-product innovation, China is very weak. There's no way around it. The central government is the main antagonist in the process. The political economic institutions and system in China make it so entrepreneurs can't make profit by developing novel innovation. But this same system makes process and second-generation innovation very profitable and successful.
China doesn't need to crave novel innovation. For China's stage of development, with the amount of people it has, the size of the labor force, and the skills developed by China's education system, this is a vastly smarter utilization of its muscle and brain power.
Michael Murphree: There is a tendency in the business literature and discussions to equate innovation with invention, measured as the output of patents and peer-reviewed articles or new products. From this perspective, if you look at the metrics, it is believed that if you have high numbers then you are innovative and will have growth. If you don't, you'll fade. This leads to a tired dichotomy: either China is already innovating, or it's on borrowed time and will stagnate like other middle income countries.
Innovation is not just invention; it's the whole array of moving and improving inventions so consumers get better, newer, and cheaper products and services. For example, consider the case of Techfaith, a Beijing company that produces innovative products that sell under other brand names but is not a contract manufacturer. A lot of what we think of as innovation is what we notice in the final gizmo, but the innovation is actually in the guts that make the device work.
Mr. Breznitz: Another example might relate more to most people's experiences. Do you own an Apple computer? There's a white power supply box on the power cord. That box has been improved with continuous R.&D. so it doesn't go up in smoke and so it will do what it does ever more efficiently. This is entirely done in China. The company that makes the power supplies is constantly doing research to make them smaller, more efficient, cooler, cheaper, and less energy intensive. This can only be done in China because firms can find high-quality engineers and tell them, 'You will make power supplies better' and the engineers will oblige. What are the chances you can hire someone from an elite U.S. university such as Carnegie Mellon to do that? This gives China power in the global production networks.
Mr. Breznitz: As long as we have a fragmented global system of production, you will need places that specialize in different stages to make "inventions" into real things at a price that people can afford.
Probably, over time, due to its critical mass of production capabilities, China can command more and more of a premium on these activities. Over the next 15 years, we think that China's model is not just sustainable, but that China's power will actually grow. I don't think China needs to worry about indigenous innovation right now.
Mr. Breznitz: What you're trying to do when you create industrial innovation policies is to create agents that produce innovation. Unlike the Japanese or Korean developmental state where they tried to create a car industry where the product, market, and technology is defined, when fostering innovation you don't know what the products will be or what the markets will look like. This means planning has limited effectiveness but does not mean there is not a large role for the state.
Look at the cases of Israel and Taiwan. The state has a role first as financier and stimulator of innovation. This is not done by strategically choosing winners but, in the case of Israel, by making capital available to entrepreneurs and scientists to pursue their ideas. The second role is to create ventures by making an institutional and economic framework in which entrepreneurship is rewarded. In the case of Taiwan, even after new ideas were developed, most businessmen perceived technological entrepreneurship as too risky. Hence the state directly created the first ventures in new industries, creating the model and market. But these were not state-owned or controlled. They were state-created and quickly spun-off private and entrepreneurial ventures.
For the Chinese government to have large projects that are mostly copying ideas or industries already developed elsewhere is not the way to go. Hence megaprojects in building wide-body aircraft or supercomputers may just be costly diversions in terms of innovation.
However, encouraging the diffusion of technology in China is an area the state can and should encourage.
Choosing winners is a dead end. Look at how China has done in rolling out telecom technologies. By trying to develop new technologies by government fiat, there has been a tremendous holdup in adoption of 3G and 4G.
Mr. Murphree: There is a belief, accepted on faith, that markets are organic and dynamic, and that if the government steps away, innovation will blossom. But there is a really clear role the Chinese government should play. At the most basic level, they should clearly define and enforce rules and regulations because markets are created by rules and laws.
Mr. Breznitz: Becoming a regulator and law enforcer is one point. But the reality is more complex. If you are to look at major innovative countries, Finland, Taiwan, Israel, and even the U.S., almost all great new technologies came in large extent thanks to government funding and pushing. Hence, apart from being the regulator, the state often stimulates and steps in. In Taiwan, the government gave training and much more to the semiconductor companies, and taught them how to make a profit. In Israel, without the state channeling money toward R.&D., pushing innovations and lowering the risk that entrepreneurs needed to take in order to do R.&D., there wouldn't have been the Israeli high-tech miracle with its hundreds of companies listed on Nasdaq. So there is an active role for the Chinese government to play.
Mr. Breznitz: The things that will help China have strength, sustain growth and make the country more profitable are to focus on its existing activities in production and development. China should put more R.&D. around those activities and make itself a player in even more stages and activities.
The second problem to address is that the finance system is broken. Improving it would do a lot. Make it easier and more transparent for companies to get financing.
Third, every big company, including Lenovo, now needs to have multiple ownership structures to engage in new and different activities. Trying to balance foreign, state, and private ownership forms and structures within the same organization or group of companies in order to participate in different market segments or economic activities is a drain on resources. Equal treatment for different types of firms would be beneficial.
And then there's the rule of law. Fix that part. Making laws and regulations clear will go a long way. Uncertainly means higher risks.
R.&D., especially novel-product R.&D., is expensive, time-consuming and inherently risky. Uncertainty over political and economic institutions makes it even more risky and discourages investment or entrepreneurship in this area. We're not even talking about intellectual property rights. This is about basic rule of law. Even if laws appear restrictive, having clear and enforced laws will reduce uncertainty and immensely benefit R.&D.-intensive enterprises.

HEADLINE: Pacific Islands Band Together on a Shark Sanctuary

BYLINE: JOANNA M. FOSTER


HIGHLIGHT: The harvesting of sharks and the possession or sale of shark parts will be banned throughout Palau, the Marshall Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, Micronesia and Guam.

 BODY:
As Americans tune in to TV programs like "Top 5 Eaten Alive" and "Jaws Comes Home" as part of Discovery Channel's Shark Week, leaders in the western Pacific have taken a big step toward nurturing the predator, jointly deciding to create the largest shark sanctuary in the world. 
The sanctuary covers two million square miles, roughly equivalent to two-thirds of the continental United States, and is the first joint regional attempt to protect sharks. The move was approved in a joint resolution signed at the 15th Micronesian chief executive summit meeting on the Micronesian island of Pohnpei.
The resolution opens a yearlong process to officially establish the sanctuary. It bans the harvesting of sharks and the possession and sale of shark parts throughout the island nations of Palau, Micronesia, the Marshall Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands as well as Guam.While many of these nations and Guam, a United States territory, already had measures in place to protect sharks to some extent, including Palau, which created the world's first shark sanctuary in 2009, the agreement represents a regional consensus on shark conservation standards and strategy. 
It is the first time that Micronesia and the Marshall Islands, which have exclusive economic control over about 1.5 million square miles of ocean, have taken action to protect sharks in their waters. "This issue is finally gaining traction," said Matt Rand, director of global shark conservation for the Pew Environment Group, which helped draft the agreement. 
In addition to the agreement in the western Pacific, Mr. Rand pointed to sanctuaries created in Honduras, Chile and the Bahamas this year. 
While watching sharks stalk their prey to eerie soundtracks may make for heart- stopping television, the fact is that sharks are responsible for the death of only two to three people each year. Yet people kill nearly 73 million sharks annually, primarily for their fins to meet a demand for shark-fin soup in Asia. Nearly one-third of all shark species are threatened with extinction. 
"Sharks are unlike any other fish," Mr. Rand said. "They grow slowly, reach sexual maturity relatively late in life and only give birth to a few pups. In my opinion, there is no way, even in theory, to harvest them sustainably."
The Pew Environment Group is already turning its attention to Fiji and American Samoa in the hope of expanding the network of shark sanctuaries around the world. Mr. Rand hopes that within five years, shark-hunting will be be banned in most of the Pacific.

HEADLINE: Rates of Wrath

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Things fall apart, the euro cannot hold.

 BODY:
Not good news in stock markets -- but you really have to look at the bond markets to get the full awfulness of the situation.
The US 10-year bond rate is now down to 2.5%. So much for those bond vigilantes. What this rate is saying is that markets are pricing in terrible economic performance, quite possibly a double dip. And it also says that Washington's deficit obsession has been utterly, totally wrong-headed.
Meanwhile, Italy's spread against German bonds is soaring even further. What are markets pricing in here? Default as a real possibility; maybe even euro breakup. The latter certainly sounds a lot more plausible now than it did a few months ago.
Oh, by the way, how do I know that falling rates in America and rising rates in Italy are both bad news? Part of the answer is that you have to look at the context. My old teacher Charles Kindleberger used to say about balance of payments analysis that everyone wanted a single number that told you whether things were good or bad, but what you really needed, always, was a story.
But if that doesn't satisfy you, you can always make sure to look at more than one market. Italian stocks are plunging, which tells you that the rate rise isn't about economic optimism; so are US stocks, which tells you that our rate fall isn't about optimism regarding US solvency.
So things are falling apart all over. Maybe someone should do something?

HEADLINE: Labor's Decline and Wage Inequality

BYLINE: STEVEN GREENHOUSE


HIGHLIGHT: The decline in organized labor's power and membership has played a larger role in fostering increased wage inequality in the United States than is generally thought, according to a new study.

 BODY:
The decline in organized labor's power and membership has played a larger role in fostering increased wage inequality in the United States than is generally thought, according to a study published in the American Sociological Review this month.
The study, "Unions, Norms and the Rise in U.S. Wage Inequality," found that the decline in union power and density since 1973 explained a third of the increase in wage inequality among men since then, and a fifth of the increased inequality among women. 
The study noted that from 1973 to 2007, union membership in the private sector dropped to 8 percent from 34 percent among men and to 6 percent from 16 percent among women. During that time, wage inequality in the private sector increased by more than 40 percent, the study found.
While many academics argue that increased inequality in educational attainment has played a major role in expanding wage inequality, the new study reaches a surprising conclusion, saying, "The decline of the U.S. labor movement has added as much to men's wage inequality as has the relative increase in pay for college graduates." The study adds that "union decline contributes just half as much as education to the overall rise in women's wage inequality."
The study was written by Bruce Western, a professor of sociology at Harvard University, and Jake Rosenfeld, a sociology professor at the University of Washington.The two professors found that the decline of organized labor held down wages in union and nonunion workplaces alike. Many nonunion employers -- especially decades ago, when unions represented more than 30 percent of the private sector work force -- raised wages to help avert the threat of union organizing. 
Moreover, the study argues that when unions were larger and had a far greater voice in politics and society, they played a more influential role in advocacy on wages across the economy, for instance, in pushing to raise the minimum wage.
"In the early 1970s, when one in three male workers were organized, unions were often prominent voices for equity, not just for their members, but for all workers," the two professors wrote. "Union decline marks an erosion of the moral economy and its underlying distributional norms. Wage inequality in the nonunion sector increased as a result."
The two professors note that the decline of unions is part of a common account of rising inequality that is often contrasted with a market explanation that includes technological change, immigration and foreign trade. They argue that the market explanation usually understates the role of organized labor's decline on increased inequality.
The study notes that in the 1970s, some skilled-trades unions and construction unions helped to increased inequality through exclusionary practices that reinforced racial and ethnic inequalities. But the study said that, over all, unions in the United States had been an important force for reducing inequality -- although not as much as unions in Europe, which have more influence in politics and society.
The authors found that the biggest factor in the decline in unions' power and density was job growth outside traditional labor strongholds like manufacturing, construction and transportation. They added that another important reason for the decline of organized labor was that "employers in unionized industries intensified their opposition" to unionization efforts.
They noted that as unions have grown weaker, there has been less pressure on lawmakers to enact labor-friendly or worker-friendly measures. "As organized labor's political power dissipates," the authors wrote, "economic interests in the labor market are dispersed and policy makers have fewer incentives to strengthen unions or otherwise equalize economic rewards."

HEADLINE: Regulators Finalize New Derivatives Rules

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: But many more rules required under the Dodd-Frank Act remain to be written by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

 BODY:
After missing deadlines for new derivatives rules last month, financial regulators are now bearing down on the freewheeling industry. 
On Thursday, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission finalized a fresh batch of regulations governing the $600 trillion market, giving the government new tools to help monitor the financial industry. 
The rules, most notably, enacted plans to collect a battery of data on derivatives deals and created a whistle-blower program to reward tipsters who exposed fraud in the marketplace. 
"The C.F.T.C. has turned the corner toward final rules," Gary Gensler, the agency's chairman, said at a public meeting in Washington. "Today, we are building on this momentum."
Last month, the commodity commission adopted the first in a series of derivatives regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act, the vast financial regulatory overhaul enacted after the crisis. The rules granted the government broad new powers to prosecute fraud and insider trading within the derivatives market. 
The agency has drafted 11 new rules so far this summer, a small dent in its Dodd-Frank duty. Some 40 rules remain on hold, including the most contentious proposals that will spell out which companies are exempt from the overhaul. 
Regulators fell behind on the rules amid complaints from industry lobbyists and Republican lawmakers who have said that the agency was a threat to an economic recovery. In response, regulators agreed in June to holdup many new derivatives regulations until the end of the year, a nearly six-month delay.
Mr. Gensler said on Thursday that his agency was "likely" to take up some thornier rules in the fall, while cautioning that the entire process remained in flux. "I say 'likely' because there's a lot of work to be done and this could easily change," he said. 
For now, Mr. Gensler was satisfied signing off on just the data rules and whistle-blower program. 
The agency, in a 4-1 vote, adopted an array of requirements for so-called swap data repositories. The new entities will collect once-private data about swap trades, a type of derivative contract that is tied to the value of a commodity, mortgage or other asset. Under the rules, the repositories must authenticate and aggregate pricing information and other data electronically so regulators can keep an eye on the market. 
"Leading up to the 2008 financial crisis, swaps operated in the shadows," Mr. Gensler said in a statement. "With this rule, regulators -- for the first time -- will have specific information on the market's scale and risk."
But some on the commission questioned whether the rule was too soft. Michael Dunn, a Democrat like Mr. Gensler, expressed "grave concerns" that the regulation did not require data collectors to feature independent directors.
The whistle-blower rule, also adopted in a 4-1 vote, generated its own controversy.
The program would provide a bounty to whistle-blowers who exposed Ponzi schemes or other wrongdoing. To qualify for the reward, tipsters must turn over new information that spawns a "successful enforcement action" worth more than $1 million. 
Republican commissioners, one of whom voted against the program, complained that it would allow insiders to bypass internal compliance departments and take their tips straight to the government. The criticism echoed concerns recently raised about the S.E.C.'s new whistle-blower program, which was adopted in May. 
But Bart Chilton, a Democrat on the commission, said the whistle-blower program had improved over time. 
"Frankly, this rule wasn't too hot when we first proposed it," he said.
But now, he added, "I think it will be a very important tool in our enforcement arsenal."

HIGHLIGHT: Mayors of New Jersey towns are hoping to revive a bid to host a Formula One grand prix, with Manhattan as a backdrop, as early as 2013.

 BODY:
In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web:
 New Jersey communities reportedly have renewed their ambition to hold a Formula One grand prix in coming years. Though it was not released widely to the motorsports media, the mayors of Weehawken and West New York issued a release this week stating that their offices were in talks with a group of investors about holding a Formula One race in the North Hudson area, perhaps as early as 2013. After a five-year absence, Formula One is scheduled to return to the United States next summer in Austin, Tex. (Formula One blog)
 Second-quarter earnings for General Motors equaled $2.5 billion, an increase of 89 percent over the same period last year, the automaker reported Thursday. The results were driven by strong sales in G.M.'s core North American market, where the company earned $2.2 billion compared with $1.6 billion during the second quarter of 2010. The company said it expected income in the second half of the year to be "modestly lower" than the first half, due to market conditions and the overall industry outlook. (The New York Times)
 Mazda announced Thursday that July sales in Japan of its Demio subcompact, sold as the Mazda 2 in North America, exceeded projections by more than 100 percent. The Demio, which received a facelift and the automaker's Skyactiv efficiency-boosting technology earlier this year in Japan, was delivered to 13,500 customers. Though plans have not been confirmed by Mazda USA to import the Skyactiv-equipped car, the technology is scheduled to appear in the new Mazda 3 and the coming CX-5 compact S.U.V. (Mazda)
 The 2012 Infiniti FX, which arrives at dealers in October, wears a revised front fascia inspired by the Essence concept first shown by Nissan's luxury subsidiary in 2009. The FX is the first confirmed production vehicle to draw from the concept, which Infiniti expects to inform its entire future model line. Pricing is higher for the 2012 FX, with the all-wheel-drive FX35 starting at $44,345, or $850 more than the outgoing model, and $60,245 for the FX50, or $100 more than the 2011 version.

HEADLINE: Stocks Are Still Expensive

BYLINE: DAVID LEONHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: Relative to earnings, stocks still look costly.

 BODY:
The main problem for the stock market is obviously the economy. But it's not the only problem. Stocks are also under pressure because they are fairly expensive right now relative to earnings.
My favorite way to look at stock prices is to compare them to corporate earnings over the previous decade. By this measure, the price-earnings ratio for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index over the last 50 years has been 19.5. After today's market drop, the ratio was 20.7. 
So stocks would have to fall another 6 percent from their current level to return to the 50-year average.
This version of the P/E ratio is not the most popular one. You're more likely to see a ratio based on one year of past earnings or on a projection of future. But the 10-year measure has several advantages over the other versions.
It was first recommended, as far as we know, by Benjamin Graham and David L. Dodd, in their classic 1934 textbook, "Security Analysis." Mr. Graham was an important mentor to Warren Buffett. More recently, Robert Shiller, who correctly called both the dot-com bubble and the housing bubble, has argued for using a measure like the 10-year ratio. The data in this post comes from Mr. Shiller's Web site.
In their book, Mr. Graham and Mr. Dodd urged investors to use a price-to-earnings ratio -- that is, stock prices divided by average annual corporate earnings per share -- based on at least five years of earnings and, ideally, closer to 10. Corporate profits may rise or fall in any given year, depending on the state of the economy, but a share of stock is a claim on a company's long-term earnings and should be evaluated as such.
Future earnings are even more flawed than short-term past earnings, because Wall Street projections have a pretty weak track record.
Of course, saying that the 10-year P/E ratio is historically high is by no means guaranteeing that stocks will fall. Stocks can remain historically expensive or cheap for many years.
But the 10-year ratio does have a pretty good track record. In 2007, when many Wall Street traders and economists were claiming that stocks were still a great buy, the 10-year ratio knew better. Likewise, it helped predict the market's rebound in early 2009, when optimists were not easy to find.
That stocks remain expensive is one more reason to be concerned about the economy.

HEADLINE: Some Advice For Democrats

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: The road to compromise leads through intransigence.

 BODY:
The narrative that Republicans behaved like "terrorists" during the debt ceiling negotiations has become pretty well entrenched among Democratic partisans, and I doubt that any counter-arguments will dislodge it. Before we turn the page on this particular episode, I just want to highlight a few points, all from left-of-center writers, that suggest a slightly healthier way that liberals might look at recent events.
First, William Galston, expressing exasperation at the way that the White House and Congressional Democrats essentially sprang the debt ceiling trap on themselves:
As many critics have pointed out, this man-made crisis was entirely avoidable. The Democrats could have raised the ceiling last December. They chose not to, handing a sword to their adversaries. Senate majority leader Harry Reid wanted to force the incoming Republicans to accept some responsibility for the increase. We've seen how that worked out. And if President Obama genuinely believed that the Republicans would cooperate because it was the right and responsible thing to do, then naivete was the least of his mistakes. (A moment of introspection about his own 2006 vote against increasing the debt ceiling should have sufficed to disabuse him of that notion.)
Then Glenn Greenwald, expressing reluctant admiration for the Tea Partiers:
There is much criticism that can be, should be and has been directed at the Tea Party. But one virtue that must be acknowledged is that elected Tea Party officials have largely stayed faithful to the promises they made to those who sent them to Washington. Those candidates emphatically vowed to block spending and tax increases, avoid business-as-usual compromises, and - echoing the 2008 version of Obama - change the culture in Washington. Destructive though they are, they are succeeding. And many progressives - infuriated yet again by the Democrats' so-called "capitulation" - are likely wallowing in an envious daydream: What is it like to have representatives in Washington actually adhering to their vows and fighting for the principles they claim during elections to embrace.
Finally, Ezra Klein, advising the Democrats to imitate Republican intransigence in the looming debate over the renewal of the Bush tax cuts:
Democrats will have exactly one chance to overcome the GOP's resistance to tax revenue. Next year, the Bush tax cuts expire. If Congress does nothing, we revert to Clinton-era tax rates for everyone, and the federal coffers fill with $3.6 trillion in additional revenue over the next 10 years - enough to stabilize deficits. This is a rare opportunity in which it's Democrats who hold the hostage and Republicans who have to compromise.
His post is entitled: "To govern responsibly, the White House will have to negotiate like Republicans."
The theme running through all of these arguments is simple enough: If Democrats expect to win political battles in an era of divided government, they need to behave as if those battles actually matters to them. If they don't want the Republican Party to demand concessions in exchange for voting to raise the debt ceiling, don't concede their premise (it's an odd sort of hostage situation when the hostage seems to want to be there) and enter into months of negotiation over the size and scope of the deficit cuts; do what Bill Clinton did and actually call the Republicans' bluff. If you want the G.O.P. to agree to a grand bargain on taxes, make it clear that you're as willing to raise taxes as they are (or at least as Paul Ryan and the House Republicans are) to cut entitlements. If they don't want Republicans to use what leverage they have against you, then use what leverage you have against .
During the debt ceiling negotiations, I argued that by passing on a grand bargain today, Republicans were risking a bigger defeat on taxes down the road. The response that I got from more than a few conservatives was telling: They simply didn't believe that the Democrats would muster the political will to actually let the Bush tax cuts expire. And if that assumption is correct, then the Republican refusal to bend on taxes makes all the sense in the world. If you don't think your opposition can actually pull the trigger and fire the bullets in its gun, then why not wait till after the next election to cut a deficit deal? At best, you'll have a Republican president and a better final package; at worst, the same basic bargain will still be on the table, because the Democrats won't have the guts to take it off.
This is the reality that liberals need to face: Much of the Republican "intransigence" and "hostage-taking" and "terrorism" that they deplore is a direct consequence of the fact that Republicans assume that Democrats will always, , cave on taxes. And so long as that assumption keeps getting vindicated by events, there's no incentive for the G.O.P. to accede to sweeping compromises on deficit reduction. Why would you compromise with a party that won't actually fight for the revenues required to pay for the programs it claims to want to protect? Why would you sign off on tax increases that your notionally pro-government opposition doesn't want to sign off on themselves?
Historically, Republicans have had a similar problem with entitlement spending, where they've shied away from the kind of cuts that their vision of government requires. But this was why the Paul Ryan budget was so important: Not because it was ever going to become law, but because it suggested that Congressional Republicans were finally serious about achieving what they consider the correct policy outcome on taxes and spending, even if it isn't the popular one and even if it costs them at the polls. Until Democrats demonstrate a similar seriousness - until they find a way to dig in their heels and hold the economy "hostage" to tax increases the way Republicans just did with spending cuts - the G.O.P. will have no reason to take them seriously as negotiating partners. In the long run, you can't have compromise without intransigence.

HEADLINE: Double Dip or Not, Economy Is Falling Further Behind

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: Leading indicators, like an index of manufacturing activity, have printed poorly, about at the levels that suggest the economy is on the brink of another recession.

 BODY:
While Washington was busy debating whether or not to sabotage the recovery by failing to raise the federal debt ceiling, the economy seemed to be doing everything in its power to demonstrate that it's in feeble health to begin with.
Leading indicators, like an index of manufacturing activity, have printed poorly, about at the levels that suggest the economy is on the brink of another recession. Although bearish economists have been warning about recession risk for some time now -- and looking the wiser for it -- concerns about a double-dip have crossed into the mainstream. The Harvard economist Martin Feldstein thinks there is a 50-50 chance of another recession. We may even be in a recession right now.
In some sense, however, this is beside the point. The American economy lost a ton of ground during the global financial crisis. Slipping back into a recession -- meaning negative growth -- obviously wouldn't help matters at all. But neither, really, would slow growth of the sort we've experienced during the first half of the year. 
In the chart below, I've plotted the United States's gross domestic product, adjusted for inflation, dating back to 1877. The data incorporates the recent substantial downward revisions to G.D.P., which suggested both that the economic crash was even worse than economists had previously believed -- at one point, G.D.P. was declining at an annualized rate of nearly 9 percent -- and that the recovery has been even more timid.
G.D.P. is plotted on a logarithmic scale in the chart, which reflects the fact that, over the long-run, the American economy has been growing exponentially. The rate of growth has in fact been quite steady over the long run: since 1877, the annual rate of G.D.P. growth has averaged about 3.5 percent after inflation. There has also been strong a tendency for these numbers to revert to the mean: periods of above-average growth have generally been followed by periods of below-average (or negative) growth, and vice versa.
So far, however, there hasn't been much of a rebound from the Great Recession. In the next chart, I've plotted how far ahead or below of the long-term trend that the economy is at any given time. Basically, instead of thinking about the economy in terms of the of growth, we're instead thinking about how strong or weak it is in an absolute sense. An economy may technically be out of recession -- meaning, that it is no longer shrinking -- while still being well below its productive capacity. 
Here, you can really see the effects of the Great Depression. In early 1933, G.D.P. was about what it "should" have been based on long-term growth rates. But the economy recovered at a rapid clip over the course of the next decade. In fact, G.D.P. temporarily overshot, exceeding the long-term trend during World War II as America employed all the industry and labor that it could get its hands on to help with the war effort.
By this measure, most post-World War II recessions are barely detectable. They look more like reversions to the mean after years of above-average growth.
The Great Recession, however, is highly visible. G.D.P. had already been a couple of percentage points below the long-term trend before it began, as the recovery from the 2001-2 recession was not particularly robust. But things got much worse in a hurry.
Looked at this way, in fact, not only is the worst not yet over -- the situation is still deteriorating. Every quarter that the economy grows at a rate below 3.5 percent, it loses ground relative to the long-term trend. Although the economy grew at a 3.8 annual percent rate from fall 2009 through summer 2010, over the past year growth has averaged just 1.6 percent, putting us farther behind.
Right now, gross domestic product is about $13.3 trillion dollars, adjusted for inflation -- when it "should" be $15.7 trillion based on the long-term trend. That puts us more than 15 percent below what we might think of as full output, by far the worst number since the Great Depression.
If the economy were to enter another recession and shrink by 1 percent over the course of the next year, we would wind up 19 percent behind the long-term trend. But even if it were to grow at 2 percent, we would still be 17 percent behind.
What we need, instead, is above-average growth -- in fact, quite a lot of it. Even if the economy were to begin growing at a 5 percent annual rate, it would take until 2018 for it to catch up to the long-term trend.

HEADLINE: California Police Warn Against 'Tunneling' on Beaches

BYLINE: J. DAVID GOODMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The rescue of a 17-year-old buried alive for 20 minutes under sand is the latest example of the dangerous summer practice of "tunneling," police in California say.

 BODY:
Matt Mina was digging his way under more than six feet of sand beneath Newport Beach, Calif., on Wednesday afternoon when suddenly the crumbly walls of his makeshift tunnel collapsed. The weight trapped him and, for roughly 20 minutes, he was buried in the sand.
In the chaotic scene that followed, beachgoers and emergency workers dug with any available object -- buckets, shovels, their bare hands -- until finally reaching the trapped 17-year-old, alive but barely conscious.
The beach erupted in applause, but on Thursday the police issued a stern warning about so-called tunneling on beaches, The Los Angeles Times reported. 
"He was doing what we call tunneling, which is a very dangerous operation," said Jeff Boyles of the Newport Beach Fire Department, adding that that when such activities go wrong, they have a "high fatality rate."Indeed, the Newport Beach collapse was far from the first such instance. This year, at least two other teenagers in California have been buried by collapsing sand tunnels, according to KSBW television news in central California, which said that one of the teenagers, a 17-year-old in Danville, remained in a coma after being trapped for nearly 15 minutes. 
And Skip Snead of the surfing magazine Ghetto Juice, who shot the above video of the scene, told the "Today" show that years before, another child who had been buried in the sand on the same beach as Mr. Mina had not been as lucky. 
Events like this have been a regular -- if infrequent -- risk of summer for as long as children have played in sand.
As The New York Times reported in 1914, six children upstate from ages 6 to 10 died in a sand-tunnel cave.
The Robinson boy is supposed to have dislodged the sand which engulfed him and the five girls. They were in a tunnel or cave they had dug into the foot of the bank when they were covered with several feet of sand.
Several years earlier, also in upstate New York, two children met a similarly unfortunate end after what began as normal afternoon for a preteen in 1900:
While searching for crickets with which to fish on Labor Day, Myron Du Bois and Peter Pallen, aged about eleven years, were buried by the caving in of a sand bank and were suffocated late Saturday afternoon.
Several hours later, a group of children who were playing in the sand discovered a shoe sticking up from the sand, but could not lift it. Further examination revealed the fact that the shoe inclosed a foot.
For his part, Mr. Mina may have survived because, as he said on television Thursday morning, "I had a little pocket of air." 
Asked if he knew about the frantic rescue efforts, he said, "I had no clue -- once you're six feet under, you can't really hear anything up top."

HEADLINE: Debt Talk Over, Republicans Head to Iowa

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: For the 2012 presidential candidates, the fun gets under way in earnest this weekend.

 BODY:
After weeks of an all-consuming debt debate in Washington, the political conversation is about to take a sharp turn back to the presidential election as Republicans gather in Iowa for the first real test of momentum and organization.
The Republican candidates for president have had a tough time grabbing the camera lens in recent days as journalists, talk show hosts, bloggers and pundits have been focused on the stalemate on taxes and spending.
But that is starting to change.
Next week, most of the presidential candidates will descend on Iowa, where they will debate on Thursday in the first full-blown exchange involving all of the leading contenders. The next day, they will attend the Iowa State Fair, a rite of passage for presidential candidates. And on Saturday, most will compete in the straw poll in Ames, an early, if flawed, event that will shape the campaign.
There are bus tours planned. (Representative Ron Paul's bus is wrapped in the Constitution.) There will be rallies, town-hall style meetings, meet-and-greets and house parties. And in between will be hours of driving from place to place across the vast expanse of Iowa.
The fun starts this weekend for some of the candidates. But already, with the debt-ceiling debate behind them, the candidates have begun to come out of their shells again.
Here's a sampling:
* Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota began broadcasting a new campaign ad in Iowa on Wednesday, this one featuring her standing in -- where else? -- Ames. In the ad, Mrs. Bachmann notes that she voted no on the debt-ceiling agreement and would stand up to the politicians in Washington who are "looting" the Treasury. 
* Jon M. Huntsman Jr., the former governor of Utah, was in New Hampshire this week, but will be coming to Iowa for the debate. Mr. Huntsman stepped up his criticism of his rivals, accusing them of showing "very little leadership" during the debt fight and singling out Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, as remaining mum about it until the last minute. (Mr. Romney said on Monday that he opposed the deal reached by President Obama and the Republican Congressional leadership. Mr. Huntsman said he reluctantly supported it.)
* Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska, is still not a candidate and will not be in Iowa next week. But she refuses to remain quiet. During an interview on Fox, she blasted Mr. Romney's position on the debt issue, saying that he waited to see which way the political winds were blowing to say what he thought. "Bless his heart, I have respect for Mitt Romney, but I do not have respect for what he has done through this debt-increase debate," she said. Lifting her finger into the air, she added, "He did this. He waited until it was a done deal."
* Rick Perry, the governor of Texas, is also not an official candidate. But most observers believe he is preparing to jump into the race as soon as the straw poll is over. Mr. Perry is slated this weekend to hold a "prayer rally," an event that has drawn some criticism from the Anti-Defamation League and other groups. "Governor Perry has a constitutional duty to treat all Texans equally, regardless of race, religion or ethnicity," the group said in a statement. "His official involvement with The Response, at minimum, violates the spirit of that duty."
* Mr. Romney decided not to compete in the Ames straw poll, but he will be attending Thursday's debate. As the front-runner in the 2012 contest, he continues to ignore his Republican rivals in favor of a laser-like focus on Mr. Obama. A new online ad highlighted the economic situation in Chicago even as Mr. Obama arrived there for a 50th birthday party and fund-raiser on Wednesday night. Mr. Romney's aides also started hinting this week that he would soon become more active on the campaign trail.
* Tim Pawlenty, the former governor of Minnesota, is the hardest-working of the bunch. His campaign has scheduled many days of multiple stops across all parts of Iowa. It is no accident. Trailing in the polls, Mr. Pawlenty and his aides are hoping to do well in the Ames straw poll to give his campaign a boost -- though they continue to try and lower expectations by pointing to the strength of Mrs. Bachmann and Mr. Paul. Next week, Mr. Pawlenty reportedly will stop running the television ads he has been broadcasting in the state and divert money to efforts to turn out his supporters for the straw poll.
* Mr. Paul is set to arrive in Iowa early next week with his son, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, and members of their extended family. Ron Paul, who voted against the debt-ceiling increase, this week called the committee that is to consider more cuts in federal spending "monstrous." That kind of message could play well in Iowa, where Mr. Paul could do well in the straw poll. His campaign has started a new, Ames-specific Web site and is ramping up its campaigning ahead of the event.

HEADLINE: Will Debt Deal Force Higher Taxes on the Rich?

BYLINE: MATT BAI


HIGHLIGHT: Democrats hope the debt deal will mean an end to the Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthy -&#160;but there are significant reasons to think that it won't.

 BODY:
During the 2008 campaign, President Obama and his rivals for the nomination used to talk a lot about how they were going rid the world of both Osama bin Laden and the Bush Administration's tax cuts for the wealthy. Turns out that, of the two, bin Laden is just a whole lot easier to kill.
This is a big reason that White House advisers are now saying that the deal they struck with Republicans over the debt ceiling is better than it appears. Built into the architecture of this arcane compromise, Democrats say, is a "secret trigger" - that is, a stealthy way to finally roll back the tax cuts for the affluent (those earning more than $250,000 annually) that are now slated to cost, by some estimates, about $1 trillion over the next 10 years.
The thinking behind this secret trigger idea goes like this: First, lawmakers on the so-called super-committee - think of them kind of like the Hall of Justice heroes, only flabbier and somewhat less diverse - will almost certainly come up short in their effort to agree on how to find roughly $1.5 trillion in additional savings by the end of this year. 
If that happens, then Congress, under the terms of this week's deal, will face another crisis just after the 2012 election. At that point, members will be forced either to make a new deal on spending reductions or face automatic cuts in the military budget and other popular programs.
That's precisely the same moment when the Bush tax cuts will expire, unless Congress acts to renew them. The administration is betting that the economy will be in somewhat better shape then, which will make higher taxes on the wealthy more palatable than they were when the two parties had this debate at the end of 2010. 
What's more, the White House assumes that Republicans in Congress won't possibly be able to argue for another round of draconian spending cuts while at the very same time advancing a bill to preserve tax cuts for the affluent. And even if they did, and managed to get it through a Democratic-controlled Senate, President Obama could veto the bill.
Hence the perfect moment for Democrats to slay what has become the party's proverbial great white whale. And it might all work out this way-except that there are a few significant reasons to think that it won't. 
For one thing, it should be clear by now that Republicans will happily and without reservation argue both for painful spending cuts tax breaks for the wealthy, all at the same time. It's just what they do.Conservatives have continually argued that tax cuts spur growth and thus create more revenue. It may sound fanciful to most Democrats, but thus far it's proven to be a pretty tenable position politically, and there's really no pressing reason for Republicans to abandon it. 
Second, it's not at all a certainty, were Republicans able get legislation through the Democratic-controlled Senate after the election, that Mr. Obama would veto a bill to extend the tax cuts, no matter what his aides say now. Should Mr. Obama lose in 2012, he's not really the kind of guy you would expect to go out in a blaze of glory, waving around a veto pen after the voters have turned him out.
And if Mr. Obama wins re-election, it's hard to imagine him opening his second term by rushing to raise taxes on the middle class, which is what Republicans would almost certainly force him to do, by including those tax cuts in any legislation he'd be inclined to veto. They might also make the tax cuts part of any new agreement to raise the debt ceiling - which, unfortunately, should be necessary again around the end of 2012.
The point here is this: Democrats should probably stop waiting for this ideal window in which they can raise taxes without anyone really putting up a fight. The whale is never going to just swim up alongside the boat and roll up on its back.
Cutting taxes, as a rule, is easy and relatively risk free. Raising them is hard and takes some combination of courage and salesmanship. This is what George W. Bush and his party understood when they agreed to tax cuts that would eventually "sunset," as if the sun ever actually sets on tax cuts in Washington. 
If Democrats are serious about reversing the policy of the Bush years, then they will probably have to be willing to make a case for eliminating all the tax cuts, not just those for the wealthiest Americans. And they may have to come up with some kind of more comprehensive plan for modernizing the entire tax code, in order to persuade voters that even if some taxes go up, they might still come out ahead.
There's no trigger, secret or otherwise, that can spare Democrats a titanic clash over taxes. In politics, you can't get the whale unless you're ready to face the waves.

HEADLINE: Alan Mulally, Ford C.E.O., Brings the Focus Electric to "Late Show"

BYLINE: NICK KURCZEWSKI


HIGHLIGHT: The executive was welcomed by a surprisingly effusive Mr. Letterman, who took a brief spin onstage in the 2012 Focus Electric.

 BODY:
Alan Mulally, the Ford Motor Company president and chief executive, took his pitch for the electric car to late-night television just after midnight on Thursday, with an appearance on "The Late Show With David Letterman" on CBS.
Introduced by his uncharacteristically effusive host as a "hero" and the man "responsible for rescuing the Ford Motor Company from the brink of bankruptcy," Mr. Mulally took his seat with a smile and a wave to the audience and, beyond it, the country Mr. Mulally hoped to sell on the Focus Electric, a purely electric compact car due in showrooms in 2012.
The conversation began in autobiographical cruise control, as the men swapped remembrances of early jobs bagging groceries and delivering newspapers. Mr. Mulally, at Mr. Letterman's urging, then talked about his 37 years of experience in the aviation industry, specifically at Boeing.
"Nearly 6 billion people have traveled on the 737," said Mr. Letterman, to the applause of the audience. After a few minutes, the perfunctory give-and-take was steered not so deftly by Mr. Letterman into the car world.
Mr. Mulally described the opportunity extended by William Clay Ford Jr., the automaker's chairman, to lead Ford as his chance "to serve a second American global icon." Mr. Letterman then pointed out that Ford weathered the global financial crisis without "government bailout money." Cue a clapping audience and a beaming auto executive.
"When I joined Ford five years ago, Dave, clearly we needed to move very quickly to a different strategy," said Mr. Mulally. "We decided together to get focused on the Ford brand and divested all the other ones." During Mr. Mulally's tenure, Ford sold its Jaguar-Land Rover and Volvo divisions, closed its Mercury brand and significantly divested itself of its holdings in Mazda.
Mr. Mulally sidestepped a question as to why other domestic automakers could not follow Ford's example, before leading Mr. Letterman on a tour of the Focus Electric hatchback, which has a driving range of 80 miles, Mr. Mulally said.
Sliding behind the wheel, Mr. Letterman drove the car from one side of the stage to the other.
Mr. Mulally's sales pitch was on target, but the shared moments of schtick were flat and felt scripted. The appearance felt like a car commercial, which is probably what it was meant to be.

HEADLINE: In Divorce Case, Judge Refuses to Hear Evidence of 'Genius'

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Henry Silverman, the former Cendant chief and Apollo Global executive, believes that he deserves most of the family fortune, which is about $450 million.

 BODY:
It is a high-class problem facing a New York judge: How do you divide $450 million in a divorce? 
That question is at the center of a legal battle between Henry R. Silverman, the prominent New York financier, and his soon-to-be former wife. The litigation, which has dragged on since early 2009, is set to go to trial later this year.
Best known as the former chief executive of the high-flying conglomerate Cendant, Mr. Silverman's resume reads like a guided tour through the rarefied realms of New York high finance. Early in his career he worked under both Steve Ross, the former chief of Time Warner, and Saul Steinberg, the corporate raider. He also served as a senior partner at the private equity giant Blackstone Group and is now a top official at Apollo Global Management, another mega-buyout firm.
His wife, Nancy Silverman, did not work outside the home during their 30-year marriage. 
Mr. Silverman believes that he deserves most of the family fortune, which he acknowledged in court papers to be about $450 million. To buttress his case, he presented the court with a novel legal argument. Mr. Silverman asked the judge to consider expert testimony from three psychologists about his "innate intellectual talents" and "unique personal traits." The psychological evaluations, Mr. Silverman said, provide a scientific basis for establishing a direct correlation between what he called his "personal capital" and the couple's wealth.
But a New York Supreme Court justice, Laura E. Drager, rejected Mr. Silverman's argument, refusing to admit the psychologists' assessments as evidence.
Judge Drager wrote that the psychologists' reports, "in purporting to prove that the success of the business could be attributed solely to the husband's innate genius," would not assist her in distributing the couple's assets. She said that there was no evidence of a "direct and statistically compelling relationship" between Mr. Silverman's "personal attributes" and his financial success. 
In denying Mr. Silverman's motion, Judge Drager cited the New York law of equitable distribution, which divides a couple's assets based on the relative contributions of each party to the marriage. She said that she must consider a variety of factors and use her discretion in splitting the marital estate. The law requires her to assess and balance "each party's contribution not to the business, but to the marital economic partnership," she wrote. "The court cannot relinquish that determination to an expert witness." 
Judge Drager acknowledged that Mr. Silverman "brought to his work innate abilities and acumen that helped cause the business to succeed." But, she added, the court had to consider the contributions of Ms. Silverman. Those include "managing the couples' domestic and social life and raising their daughter, and the social introductions and other efforts she claims to have made that assisted the husband in business," she wrote. 
The judge also noted that the psychologists' assessments "provided insufficient controls for the effect of external forces that may also have contributed to the success of the business, such as personal connections made by third parties or luck."
Lawyers for Mr. Silverman and Mrs. Silverman did not respond to request for comment. The dispute was earlier reported by The Gotham Gazette website and The New York Post. 
Mr. Silverman, who was married once before his marriage to Nancy Silverman, is planning to get married for the third time. In 2009, he got engaged to Karen Hader, with whom he had a baby boy last year. The couple live in a Manhattan townhouse on West 76th Street just off Central Park that he bought in 2010 for nearly $20 million.

HEADLINE: Rick Perry Has Stem Cell Procedure, Then Works to Bring it to Texas

BYLINE: SARAH MASLIN NIR


HIGHLIGHT: Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, a potential Republican presidential candidate, has for the past two months been working toward laying the groundwork for the commercialization of adult stem cell therapy, a highly controversial treatment which Mr. Perry underwent a month ago.

 BODY:
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, a potential Republican presidential candidate, has for the past two months been working toward laying the groundwork for the commercialization of adult stem cell therapy, a highly controversial treatment which Mr. Perry underwent a month ago.
According to the story first reported by the Texas Tribune, in the month before Mr. Perry's procedure, which was performed by Dr. Stanley Jones, a Houston-based orthopedist and a personal friend of the governor, a healthcare bill that authorized the creation of an adult stem cell bank was passed by Texas lawmakers.
And in the weeks since Perry's stem cell infusion, the Texas Medical Board has held a stakeholder meeting - largely at the governor's and Jones' direction - to discuss how to regulate the procedure in Texas.
In addition:
Two days before last week's Medical Board meeting, Perry sent a letter to the board chair espousing the economic and life-altering potential of adult stem cells and asking members to recognize "the sound science and good work that is already being done" as they consider new regulations.
On July 1, after having undergone the back procedure, Mr. Perry posted on Twitter that it "went as advertised," the Texas Tribune reported. 
Little procedure went as advertised. Blessed to be married to the world's best nurse. Thanks for all the prayers!!Sat Jul 2 0:55:19 via Twitter for BlackBerryRick PerryGovernorPerry
But according to the Tribune,
The possible presidential contender didn't reveal that he'd undergone an experimental injection of his own stem cells, a therapy that isn't FDA approved, has mixed evidence of success and can cost upwards of tens of thousands of dollars.
Dr. Jones, the Tribune reported, had never before performed the procedure.
But last year, Dr. Jones and his wife traveled to South Korea and Japan to obtain the same treatment for their own ailments. Dr. Jones told the Tribune his recovery led him to contact Mr. Perry. "I told him, I'm in Korea seeing miracles, and something needs to be done for our fellow Americans."
The South Korean company that cultured Dr. Jones' stem cells has since opened an affiliated lab outside of Houston. Mr. Perry's stem cells were cultured in that Texas-based lab.

HEADLINE: The Stock Market Is the Least of Obama's Worries

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: Is the stock market a concern for Mr. Obama above and beyond the economic fundamentals?

 BODY:
6:53 p.m. | Updated There's some Twitter sentiment to the effect that today's crash in stock prices is bad news for President Obama. That doesn't seem like a terribly controversial conclusion -- but I'm not so sure it's true.
Let's be clear: the economy is struggling, and that's a gigantic problem for Mr. Obama. In my view, his chances of re-election have dropped from perhaps two-in-three as a couple of months ago to more like a toss-up as the economic numbers have deteriorated.
But is the stock market a concern for Mr. Obama the economic fundamentals?
Certainly, markets have good reasons for pessimism on the basis of the recent numbers. And they may have been overvalued to begin with. But today's crash, in particular, came on a relatively newsless day, and reeks, at least in part, of panic.
The paradigm case for an exogenous decline in the market -- that is, one which is not well explained by economic fundamentals -- is Black Monday, the Oct. 19, 1987 crash in which the Dow Jones lost almost 23 percent of its value for reasons that remain poorly understood by traders, economists, and mathematicians. Unlike many other crashes, stock prices did not rebound particularly quickly following Black Monday, instead recovering only a part of their value over the medium-term.
So what happened to the approval ratings of then-president Ronald Reagan?
Nothing at all. When Gallup released a poll on Reagan a week after the crash, his approval rating stood at 51 percent. That was actually two points higher than the 49 percent approval rating Reagan had when Gallup had previously taken his temperature in early September, 1987.
Sure, it's just one data point. But it's a pretty robust one given how steep the 1987 crash was and how divorced it was from the economic fundamentals. It's almost like an experiment a political scientist would dream up to test the effects of the market on presidential approval. And it suggests that the stock market is among the least of a president's worries.
Where the crash could have more effect is on perceptions about the deficit-reduction deal that Mr. Obama and Congress brokered over the weekend, a bill which was already fairly unpopular and which Americans were already concerned could have negative economic effects.
Mr. Obama signed off on the deal. But polls so far have found that Americans assign more of the responsibility for it to Republicans, which makes sense since it was made largely on their terms and since they were more likely to vote for the bill in Congress.
Voters' Pavlovian reaction may simply be that fiscal austerity equals pain, which could complicate Republican messaging in the long-run.
In the short-run -- depending on what happens with the markets over the next several trading days as well as with tomorrow morning's jobs report -- the question becomes whether Mr. Obama attempts to exploit the crisis by calling for stimulative measures that were lacking in the deal he signed with Republicans.
Update: For more of an "it's complicated" view, see this paper by Alison B. Alter and Lucy M. Goodhart suggesting that stock market performance have an effect on views of the president -- or this one, by Michael S. Lewis-Beck and Charles Tien, suggesting that it doesn't. 
It isn't surprising that academics come to different conclusions about this because it's a very difficult question to study. Underlying economic performance (which certainly does matter to a president) and stock market returns are hard to separate out from one another, which creates all kinds of methodological problems.
But what the paper by Ms. Alter and Ms. Goodhart suggests is that stock market performance matters more early in a president's term, when voters have less information to assess the president's handling of the economy. 
In this instance, voters already have strong views about the economy -- they think it stinks. Moreover, we have the somewhat unique circumstance of the market downturn having followed a high-visibility action in Congress, for which Congressional leaders were assigned more direct responsibility than the president, at least according to the polls.
Also of note is that the stock market has performed well on balance while Mr. Obama has been in office. Even after the crash, the S&P 500 is up 41 percent since Mr. Obama was inaugurated. Perhaps that has prevented his approval numbers on the economy from being even worse than they already are. But it may also be that voters are more worried about things like jobs -- they have plenty of other evidence to weigh for and against the president.
So the proper conclusion here is really that we don't know what's going to happen. Which I know isn't terribly satisfying. 
Really, I'd just say to be wary about snap judgments, and keep in mind that voters are assessing not just the president but also the Congress. From a 30,000-foot level, the past few weeks have probably been bad for the re-election efforts of almost everyone in Washington, and today won't have made them better.

HUNGER STRIKE IN CHILE
FOR EDUCATION REFORM
About three dozen high school and university students in Chile have turned to starving themselves to pressure the government of President Sebastian Pinera to reform the country's education system. In the more than two months since education protests began, students have organized rallies drawing up to 100,000 people. PAGE A4
INDIA'S ANTICORRUPTION BILL 
Indian lawmakers took the first formal step toward creating an independent anticorruption agency by introducing a bill in Parliament that would appoint a powerful ombudsman to investigate wrongdoing by government officials. But critics say the bill is too weak because it exempts the prime minister, members of Parliament and many other officials. PAGE A9
NORTH KOREA'S GAMING HEIST
The North Korean leader Kim Jong-il has found a novel way of raising badly needed cash, according to the South Korean authorities: unleashing young hackers on South Korea's immensely popular online gaming sites to find ways to rack up points convertible to cash. Despite its decrepit economy, North Korea is believed to train an army of computer programmers and hackers. PAGE A4
TURKEY BEGINS A NEW ERA
Turkey's civilian leadership appointed four new commanders, decisively strengthening its control over the armed forces less than a week after the military leadership abruptly resigned in frustration over the continuing prosecution of officers accused of plotting to overthrow the government. PAGE A9

REPUBLICANS SET SIGHTS
ON BUDGET AMENDMENT
House Republicans, feeling they have scored significant fiscal victories, are moving on to an even bigger challenge: persuading voters, state legislatures and Democrats to alter the Constitution with a balanced budget amendment, which essentially stipulates that government cannot spend more than it takes in.

RETURN TRIP TO JUPITER
Sixteen years after one of their probes crashed into Jupiter, NASA is attempting a return trip to the big planet to look for the clues to the origin of the solar system. The agency is launching a spacecraft that is due to reach Jupiter's orbit in five years. PAGE A12
RULING MAY AFFECT PRESS
Proponents of press freedom have praised a ruling last week by a federal judge who protected a writer from being forced to testify in court about his sources for a book on the Central Intelligence Agency. But her opinion included a little-noticed passage suggesting that many journalists could be charged with a felony. PAGE A14

IN COURT AND IN ADMISSION,
A DISPASSIONATE DEFENDANT
Levi Aron pleaded not guilty to charges of kidnapping and murdering 8-year-old Leiby Kletzky. At the arraignment, the Brooklyn district attorney's office submitted to the defense Mr. Aron's handwritten confession, in which he admitted to killing and dismembering the boy in clinical detail. PAGE A16
Business
KRAFT FOODS ANNOUNCES
IT WILL SPLIT IN TWO
The food giant Kraft Foods said that it planned to split into two businesses. The company is essentially letting shareholders choose between its fast-growing snacks business or its grocery business, which generates a lot of cash and enjoys strong profit margins despite its lower growth. PAGE B1
G.M. EARNINGS CLIMB
General Motors, the nation's largest automaker, built surprisingly strong second-quarter results on the most basic automotive arithmetic -- higher prices plus lower incentives. The company earned $2.2 billion in its home market before interest and taxes, primarily because it was able to increase base prices twice this year and rein in rebates. PAGE B3

DESPITE PRISON AND INJURY,
BURRESS SAYS HE'S READY
Plaxico Burress suffered a minor injury to his left ankle while running routes, which kept him from what would have been his first full workout since 2008. Still, Burress, who served two years in prison after shooting himself in the leg, says he feels better than he has in a long time. PAGE B13
FAMILIAR FORMULA FOR BRAVES
The Braves dominated the National League in the 1990s with a stable of star pitchers, and now Atlanta again has a wealth of talent on the mound. It's a good thing their pitching has been so strong, because their position players are slightly below average across the board, writes Sean Forman. PAGE B12

FOR MET'S NEXT BLOCKBUSTER,
A MONUMENTAL PHARAOH
A colossal statue of pharaoh Amenemhat II weighing more than nine tons is heading to the Met by ship from Germany. When it arrives in New York in the next 10 days, it will go on view in the museum's Great Hall. The Egyptian Museum in Berlin has agreed to lend the pharaoh to the Met for 10 years. PAGE C23

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths MOORE, DAVID E

 BODY:
MOORE--David E. Born June 10, 1923 in Bar Harbor, Maine, the son of William Scoville Moore and Edith Pulitzer Moore; died at home in Rye, New York on August 2, 2011, after a short illness. He is survived by his wife of 63 years, Katherine Cromwell Moore; his sons Richard, David, Jr., and Timothy; their wives Barbara, Leni, and Debby; seven grandchildren, and one great-grandchild. His daughter Kate predeceased him. A graduate of St. 
Marks School and Harvard College, he served as a lieutenant in the 70th Armored Infantry Battalion, 20th Armored Division in Europe during WWII. After his marriage to Katherine in 1948, he worked with the Marshall Plan in London and as Executive Officer of the mission to Portugal in Lisbon. Following their return to the United States, they settled in Rye in 1951. As a grandson of newspaper publisher Joseph Pulitzer, and with journalism in his blood, he soon went to work as a reporter, first at Greenwich Life, a new weekly paper in Greenwich, Connecticut, and then at the Port Chester Daily Item, where he covered sports, police, and local government. In 1961, he founded the Harrison Independent, a weekly newspaper serving that Westchester community. Three years later, he acquired a countywide weekly, renamed it the Independent Herald of Westchester, and changed its focus from social to business news. He then merged it with the Westchester Business Journal and soon thereafter launched the Connecticut Business Journal. He remained editor-in-chief of the latter two publications until 1987. In a further publishing venture, he founded Northeast International Business magazine in 1987, which he later expanded to International Business magazine. In 1979, he was the first journalist to receive the Service to Exporters Award from the Connecticut-Rhode Island District Export Council. In 1980, the U.S. Department of Commerce presented the Connecticut Business Journal with the prestigious President's E Award, in recognition of its contribution to increasing U.S. trade and investment abroad. He served as Chairman of the Connecticut and Rhode Island District Export Council from 1982-1995. He was a director and officer of other trade groups, including WestConn International Trade Association, the largest such organization in New England, and the Westchester World Trade Council. He also served as a director and member of the executive committee of the Pulitzer Publishing Company for many years. Always willing to give of his time and energy, his local civic activities included serving as a Rye City Democratic Committee district leader, a director and treasurer of the Westchester Urban League, a trustee of Rye Country Day School, founder and first chairman of the Rye Art Center, a member of the board of directors of the Westchester Council for the Arts, and board chairman and director of the Westchester-based social service agency FIRST. Other volunteer work included Business Leaders for Sensible Priorities, Port Chester Hope House, and Children's Village in Dobbs Ferry. He also served on the boards of New York Community Media Alliance, Westchester Community College Foundation, Port Chester Carver Center, and Doolittle Lake Company, and was a founding trustee of the Pulitzer Center for Investigative Journalism. Throughout his life, he pursued his passionate interests in freedom of the press and in international economic development, which latter he considered the hope of the world. His wide-ranging interests also included international travel, political history, tennis, the outdoors and painting. He was much loved and will be sorely missed by both family and friends. A memorial service is planned for Friday, September 16 at 11am at Christ's Church, Rye, NY. In lieu of flowers, donations may be sent to Westchester Community College Foundation Scholarship Fund, Hartford Hall, 75 Grasslands Road, Valhalla, NY 10595, or Port Chester Carver Center, 400 Westchester Avenue, Port Chester, NY 10573.

HEADLINE: Joining Switzerland, Japan Acts to Ease Currency's Strength

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- As global investors flee the dollar and euro for refuge in stronger currencies, those havens have started to send out a message: enough.
Demand for currencies like the Japanese yen and Swiss franc, seen as relatively safe assets to hold in turbulent times, have surged in recent weeks, driving up their value as investors have dumped dollars and euros as a result of debt worries in the United States and Europe.
Declaring the yen's rise to be a threat to the economy, Japan's Ministry of Finance moved on Thursday to reverse the trend, a day after the typically sedentary Swiss bank unexpectedly cut interest rates in an effort to weaken the franc.
A strong currency might sound like a validation of investor confidence in the performance of an economy. But for trade-dependent Japan and Switzerland, a sudden jump in the value of their currencies can wreak havoc by making their exports uncompetitive. 
By intervening, though, Japan and Switzerland risk criticism that they are inciting what some market players call ''currency wars,'' where countries compete to devalue their currencies.
Both countries also devalued their currencies last year. South Korea and Brazil intervened in foreign exchange markets earlier this year. And China has long purchased dollar- and yen-denominated assets in an effort to keep its renminbi weak enough to sustain its export economy.
''In a dream world where the Ministry of Finance and Bank of Japan could dictate exchange rates, they certainly won't mind to see the yen weaken to 85-90 yen against the dollar,'' Takuji Okubo, chief economist in Tokyo for Societe Generale, wrote in a note to clients. ''However, with all the developed economies in the world suffering, trying to grow through a weaker currency is likely to encounter resistance.''
But Japan right now sees itself having little choice.
''The recent rise in the yen in currency markets has been one-sided and unbalanced,'' the finance minister, Yoshiko Noda, said on Thursday as he announced the start of the intervention. ''If this trend were to continue, it would harm the Japanese economy, even as we do all we can to recover from our natural disasters.''
On Thursday, Japanese authorities delivered a one-two punch. First, the Finance Ministry said it had begun selling yen and buying dollars. Then the Bank of Japan announced that it had further expanded its program to buy government and corporate bonds, a form of monetary easing aimed at increasing liquidity and helping to dilute the value of the yen.
The yen weakened steadily throughout the day, from 77.15 yen to the dollar to about 80 yen on Thursday evening in Tokyo. This week, the yen came close to a record high of near 76.25 yen to the dollar. At midday Thursday in New York, the yen was trading at 78.96 to the dollar.
''We judged that rises in the yen have economic costs, including the risk of damaging corporate sentiment and encouraging companies to shift production overseas,'' the governor of the Bank of Japan, Masaaki Shirakawa, said at a news conference.
Japan, which had taken a laissez-faire approach to currency policy from about the middle of the last decade, has over the last year become more willing to intervene. Last Sept. 15, with concerns over the American economy mounting, it spent 2.1 trillion yen in its biggest one-day intervention ever.
On March 18, a week after an earthquake, tsunami and subsequent nuclear crisis, the Group of 7 industrialized economies came to Japan's aid by staging a joint intervention, coordinating efforts to sell the Japanese yen on global currency markets. Traders had attributed the yen's surge to Japanese companies repatriating funds to finance recovery back home.
But since then, the dollar has again slumped against the yen, falling 5 percent in the last month as investors wary of the debt impasse in the United States fled to other currencies. Even after lawmakers in Washington struck a deal on Tuesday to avert a default or downgrade of United States debt, fresh concerns over the economy again weighed on the dollar.
Japan did not disclose the size of its intervention on Thursday, but traders estimated that the government had spent more than a trillion yen on the maneuver, according to Reuters. Asian central banks, Japanese retail investors and exporters bought into the dollar's rally, helping to buoy the American currency, Reuters said.
The central bank followed with its announcement that it would seek to raise liquidity by increasing its asset purchase program, including Japanese government and corporate bonds, to 15 trillion yen from 10 trillion yen announced previously.
The bank said it would also expand its credit facility -- its pool of funds available to buy up assets from banks and other businesses -- to 35 trillion yen, from 30 trillion yen. The bank also kept its benchmark interest rate near zero.
Still, the effect of moves to influence foreign exchange markets, especially by a single country, has often been short-lived. Japan acted alone in the intervention, though Tokyo was in touch with other countries over the maneuver, Mr. Noda said.
What Japanese policy makers could aim for, Mr. Okubo of Societe Generale said, was to hold the yen at the current level in the hope that the American economy showed ''some kind of strength soon.''
Japan has been desperate to shore up its fragile recovery. Even as companies have raced to repair damaged factories and resume production, they have been hit by a surge in the yen that threatens their business overseas.
The March disaster struck an economy that, despite its strong currency, was even more fragile than that of the United States. The Japanese economy has shrunk in two of the last three years, and its debt is twice the size of its economy. Japan's sovereign debt rating, AA-, is three notches below that of the United States.
On the other hand, most of Japan's debt is held domestically, and the country runs a current account surplus -- factors that help to make the yen a haven currency for investors in times of turmoil on global markets.
The recent rise in the yen is, to a large extent, the continuation of a trend that began several years ago with the global economic crisis, which caused investors to flee to the yen. Since the start of the crisis, the yen has strengthened by 30 percent against the dollar.
The muscular yen has been squeezing profits among Japanese exporters, making their cars and electronics more expensive overseas, and eroding the value of overseas earnings when converted into yen. Toyota, Honda and other exporters all recently blamed the strong yen, in part, for their sharply lower earnings in the latest quarter.
And so the nation's exporters welcomed Thursday's intervention.
''It was a really aggressive appreciation,'' Kazuo Hirai, executive deputy president at Sony, said of the yen's recent moves. ''The fact that the government decided to intervene was a good thing for Japanese industry as a whole.''

HEADLINE: The Wrong Worries

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
In case you had any doubts, Thursday's more than 500-point plunge in the Dow Jones industrial average and the drop in interest rates to near-record lows confirmed it: The economy isn't recovering, and Washington has been worrying about the wrong things.
It's not just that the threat of a double-dip recession has become very real. It's now impossible to deny the obvious, which is that we are not now and have never been on the road to recovery. 
For two years, officials at the Federal Reserve, international organizations and, sad to say, within the Obama administration have insisted that the economy was on the mend. Every setback was attributed to temporary factors -- It's the Greeks! It's the tsunami! -- that would soon fade away. And the focus of policy turned from jobs and growth to the supposedly urgent issue of deficit reduction.
But the economy wasn't on the mend.
Yes, officially the recession ended two years ago, and the economy did indeed pull out of a terrifying tailspin. But at no point has growth looked remotely adequate given the depth of the initial plunge. In particular, when employment falls as much as it did from 2007 to 2009, you need a lot of job growth to make up the lost ground. And that just hasn't happened.
Consider one crucial measure, the ratio of employment to population. In June 2007, around 63 percent of adults were employed. In June 2009, the official end of the recession, that number was down to 59.4. As of June 2011, two years into the alleged recovery, the number was: 58.2.
These may sound like dry statistics, but they reflect a truly terrible reality. Not only are vast numbers of Americans unemployed or underemployed, for the first time since the Great Depression many American workers are facing the prospect of very-long-term -- maybe permanent -- unemployment. Among other things, the rise in long-term unemployment will reduce future government revenues, so we're not even acting sensibly in purely fiscal terms. But, more important, it's a human catastrophe.
And why should we be surprised at this catastrophe? Where was growth supposed to come from? Consumers, still burdened by the debt that they ran up during the housing bubble, aren't ready to spend. Businesses see no reason to expand given the lack of consumer demand. And thanks to that deficit obsession, government, which could and should be supporting the economy in its time of need, has been pulling back.
Now it looks as if it's all about to get even worse. So what's the response?
To turn this disaster around, a lot of people are going to have to admit, to themselves at least, that they've been wrong and need to change their priorities, right away.
Of course, some players won't change. Republicans won't stop screaming about the deficit because they weren't sincere in the first place: Their deficit hawkery was a club with which to beat their political opponents, nothing more -- as became obvious whenever any rise in taxes on the rich was suggested. And they're not going to give up that club.
But the policy disaster of the past two years wasn't just the result of G.O.P. obstructionism, which wouldn't have been so effective if the policy elite -- including at least some senior figures in the Obama administration -- hadn't agreed that deficit reduction, not job creation, should be our main priority. Nor should we let Ben Bernanke and his colleagues off the hook: The Fed has by no means done all it could, partly because it was more concerned with hypothetical inflation than with real unemployment, partly because it let itself be intimidated by the Ron Paul types.
Well, it's time for all that to stop. Those plunging interest rates and stock prices say that the markets aren't worried about either U.S. solvency or inflation. They're worried about U.S. lack of growth. And they're right, even if on Wednesday the White House press secretary chose, inexplicably, to declare that there's no threat of a double-dip recession.
Earlier this week, the word was that the Obama administration would ''pivot'' to jobs now that the debt ceiling has been raised. But what that pivot would mean, as far as I can tell, was proposing some minor measures that would be more symbolic than substantive. And, at this point, that kind of proposal would just make President Obama look ridiculous.
The point is that it's now time -- long past time -- to get serious about the real crisis the economy faces. The Fed needs to stop making excuses, while the president needs to come up with real job-creation proposals. And if Republicans block those proposals, he needs to make a Harry Truman-style campaign against the do-nothing G.O.P.
This might or might not work. But we already know what isn't working: the economic policy of the past two years -- and the millions of Americans who should have jobs, but don't.

HEADLINE: Learning To Live With Debt

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Debt can kill. But you can't live without it.
Seldom have those twin realities been as stark as they are now. It was excessive debt brought on by too-easy credit that brought down the American economy and allowed some European countries to borrow money they will never be able to pay back. It is fear of debt that threatens to keep the United States from doing much to prevent a double dip recession.
A considerable part of the current economic strain stems from the fact that the credit overhang continues to haunt borrowers around the world. The lenders may have been bailed out, but the borrowers were not -- or at least not enough to return them to health. Millions of Americans remain underwater on mortgage loans. Countries that lack printing presses for their own currency find themselves unable to borrow from private lenders.
In the long run, inflation may be a significant part of the solution, enabling borrowers to pay back dollars and euros that are worth a lot less than the ones they borrowed. The soaring price of gold, now around $1,650 an ounce, makes sense only if you assume something like that is going to happen. 
But for now, such inflation is not on the horizon. To get by, the sad reality is that those who can raise capital may need to do so for the benefit of others. Germany has grudgingly moved toward that with the latest bailout of Greece, but the United States -- which now pays 2.4 percent to borrow money for 10 years, more than a percentage point less than it paid six months ago -- seemingly has no desire to try to save its own economy, let alone anyone else's.
The effort to slash spending with the possibility of a new recession looming may be foolish. Larry Summers, the economist and former Treasury secretary, pointed out in The Financial Times this week that tax receipts over the next decade would be about $1 trillion lower -- and debt that much larger -- if economic growth were shaved by half a percentage point a year. That is about the same amount that the bill passed this week claims it will save.
It appears that not much of that saving will be in the next couple of years, although the further cuts promised late this year could change that.
What is needed now is both a willingness to spend to offset the impact of the last debt debacle and a determined effort to ensure it does not happen again. But those efforts are stalling. Banks are lobbying with some success in both the United States and Europe to delay and weaken capital requirements.
And the American government shows no interest in doing anything about the incentives in current law that favor borrowing over equity. If you buy a house with the largest mortgage possible, you will pay lower taxes than if you borrowed less. Companies pay interest on loans out of pretax income, so the more they owe, the less they pay in taxes. But dividends are paid out of after-tax money.
''The U.S. tax system encourages household leverage and bank leverage, even though both are potentially destabilizing,'' is the way Narayana Kocherlakota, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, put it in a recent speech. He offered a rather modest suggestion: lower the proportion of interest payments that are deductible.
There are, of course, claims that both tax policies produce greater good for the society, by encouraging homeownership and corporate investment. He suggested ''replacing the mortgage interest deduction with a tax credit that offsets part of a buyer's down payment toward a home purchase. Such a tax credit would encourage homeownership without simultaneously providing more incentives for households to accumulate more debt.'' And lower corporate income tax rates, he said, could offset reductions in the deductibility of interest ''without simultaneously providing incentives for corporations to acquire leverage.''
The fact that those suggestions have virtually no political support reflects one of the great political and economic challenges of this era: Governments now feel a need to encourage economic growth, but don't want to spend money. Encouraging leverage seems like a good idea.
But it does have major risks. ''A financial system with dangerously low capital levels -- hence prone to major collapses -- creates a nontransparent contingent liability for the federal budget in the United States,'' said Simon Johnson, an M.I.T. economist and former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, in Congressional testimony last week. ''This can only lead to further instability, deep recessions, and damage to our fiscal balance sheet, in a version of what the Bank of England refers to as a 'doom loop.' ''
In plain English, he means Uncle Sam will get stuck with the debt when banks blow up. The fact that happened in the recent cycle is a major cause of the rising debt that seems so alarming to those who demand immediate cuts in spending totally unrelated to the financial crisis.
To hear banks tell it, every extra dollar of capital that they are forced to hold is one dollar less they can lend, and one dollar less of economic growth that the world desperately needs.
Economically, that may not make much sense. Anat Admati, a Stanford economist, argues that capital rules may force banks to change the mix of financing, but not the level. They can, she argues, simply issue more equity and have the same amount of money available to lend. And, she suggests, they will be a lot safer.
Such a strategy would reverse decades of growing leverage on bank balance sheets, and it could mean lower returns on equity, which is often the measure banks use in setting executive compensation. It would make bank failures much less likely, but ''too big to fail'' institutions may see little need for it.
Bank capital rules historically were a cause of the problem at least as much as they were an effort to deal with it. It is not only the level of required capital that matters, but the way it is computed. The rules allow banks to measure ''risk-adjusted assets,'' so they have to hold little or no capital against low risk assets. That may make sense in theory, but in practice it was possible for banks to game the system by loading up on assets that were measured as very low risk even if they were not.
That was one reason so many banks thousands of miles away from the United States owned large amounts of securities backed by American subprime mortgages. The rating agencies said they were AAA, so profits could be earned at no cost to capital. Whoops.
Similarly, the old rules said that banks could lend to their own governments with zero risk. In Europe, that was extended to include all governments in the European Union. Now there is much hand-wringing over the fact that banks have huge exposures to Greece and other peripheral euro zone countries, and must raise large amounts of new capital.
You might think new rules would do something about that. But bank regulations are set by governments, and governments want to be able to borrow as cheaply as possible. On July 20, the European Commission proposed new rules for bank capital. Those rules specified that loans to member states should be treated as having zero risk, so long as the country was borrowing in its local currency.
That was one day before a European summit ended in an agreement that will cause banks to take substantial losses on euro-denominated loans to Greece.
In Europe they want to pretend that some risky assets are really perfectly safe. In the United States, fear that this country could somehow be a new Greece was whipped up to justify inaction in the face of evidence that the economy could be in danger of sliding into a new recession. Stock markets sold off around the world over the last two weeks, with Thursday the worst day yet.
Charting a course that ameliorates the problems left by the last leverage fiasco while minimizing the chances for a new one was never going to be easy. So far, neither Europe nor the United States is doing a very good job.

HEADLINE: Retreating on Every Front: Time to Say It: Double Dip May Be Happening

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Double dip may be back.
It has been three decades since the United States suffered a recession that followed on the heels of the previous one. But it could be happening again. The unrelenting negative economic news of the past two weeks has painted a picture of a United States economy that fell further and recovered less than we had thought.
When what may eventually be known as Great Recession I hit the country, there was general political agreement that it was incumbent on the government to fight back by stimulating the economy. It did, and the recession ended. 
But Great Recession II, if that is what we are entering, has provoked a completely different response. Now the politicians are squabbling over how much to cut spending. After months of wrangling, they passed a bill aimed at forcing more reductions in spending over the next decade.
If this is the beginning of a new double dip, it will have two significant things in common with the dual recessions of 1980 and 1981-82.
In each case the first recession was caused in large part by a sudden withdrawal of credit from the economy. The recovery came when credit conditions recovered.
And in each case the second recession began at a time when the usual government policies to fight economic weakness were deemed unavailable. Then, the need to fight inflation ruled out an easier monetary policy. Now, the perceived need to reduce government spending rules out a more accommodating fiscal policy.
The American economy fell into what was at first a fairly mild recession at the end of 2007. But the downturn turned into a worldwide plunge after the failure of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 led to the vanishing of credit for nearly all borrowers not deemed super-safe. Banks in the United States and other countries needed bailouts to survive.
The unavailability of credit caused a decline in world trade volumes of a magnitude not seen since the Great Depression, and nearly every economy went into recession.
But it turned out that businesses overreacted. While sales to customers fell, they did not decline as much as production did.
That fact set the stage for an economic rebound that began in mid-2009, with the National Bureau of Economic Research, the arbiter of such things, determining that the recession ended in June of that year. Manufacturers around the world reported rapidly rising orders.
Until recently, most observers believed the American economy was in a slow recovery, albeit one with very disappointing job growth. The official figures on gross domestic product showed the United States economy grew to a record size in the final three months of 2010, having erased the loss of 4.1 percent in G.D.P. from top to bottom.
Then last week the government announced its annual revision to the numbers for the last several years. New government surveys indicated Americans had spent less than previously estimated in 2009 and 2010 on a wide range of things, including food, clothing and computers. Tax returns showed Americans even cut back on gambling. The recession now appears to have been deeper -- a top-to-bottom fall of 5.1 percent -- and the recovery even less impressive. The economy is still smaller than it was in 2007.
In June, more American manufacturers said new orders fell than rose, according to a survey by the Institute for Supply Management. The margin was small, but the survey had shown rising orders for 24 consecutive months. Manufacturers in most European countries, including Germany and Britain, also reported weaker new orders.
Back in 1980, a recession was started when the government -- despairing of its failure to bring down surging inflation rates -- invoked controls aimed at limiting the expansion of credit and making it more costly for banks to make loans. Those controls proved to be far more effective than anyone expected, and the economy promptly tanked. In July the credit controls were ended, and the economic research bureau later determined that the recession ended that month.
By the first quarter of 1981 the economy was larger than it had been at the previous peak.
But little had been done about inflation, and the Federal Reserve was determined to slay that dragon. With interest rates high, home sales plunged in late 1981 to the lowest level since the government began collecting the data in 1963. Now they are even lower.
There is, of course, no assurance that a new recession has begun or will do so soon, and a positive jobs report on Friday morning could revive some optimism. But concerns have grown that the essential problems that led to the 2007-09 recession were not solved, just as inflation remained high throughout the 1980 downturn. Housing prices have not recovered, and millions of Americans owe more in mortgage debt than their homes are worth. Extremely low interest rates helped to push up corporate profits, but companies have hired relatively few people.
In any other cycle, the recent spate of poor economic news would have resulted in politicians vying with one another to propose programs to revive growth. President Obama has called for more spending on infrastructure, but there appears to be little chance Congress will take any action. The focus in Washington is now on deciding where to reduce spending, not increase it.
There have been some hints that the Federal Reserve might be willing to resume purchasing government bonds, which it stopped doing in June, despite opposition from conservative members of Congress. But the revised economic data may indicate that the previous program -- known as QE2, for quantitative easing -- had even less impact than had been thought. With short-term interest rates near zero, the Fed's monetary policy options are limited.
Government stimulus programs historically have often appeared to be accomplishing little until the cumulative effect suddenly helps to power a self-sustaining recovery. This time, the best hope may be that the stimulus we have already had will prove to have been enough.

HEADLINE: The Tea Party and a Struggling Economy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''The Tea Party's War on America,'' by Joe Nocera (column, Aug. 2):
Why is anyone surprised that the Tea Party delegation in Congress is opposed to revenue raising? Its members don't believe economists, who are virtually unanimous in teaching that government stimulus is needed now and that failure to provide it returns us to the mistake of 1937, when, as Mr. Nocera wrote, ''Franklin Roosevelt, believing the Depression was over, tried to rein in federal spending.''
Many Tea Party supporters also do not believe scientists who warn about global warming or biologists who teach evolution. It is all of a piece: austerity, no climate change and creationism. The pity is not that we differ in opinions, but that facts are disregarded, to be subsumed by faith, not in houses of worship but in our body politic. 
SAMUEL K. ROSEN New York, Aug. 2, 2011
To the Editor:
Joe Nocera claims that President Franklin D. Roosevelt's ''cutting spending'' in 1937 made the Depression worse. It was not budget cuts but costly liberal court rulings that shrank the economy in that year.
In 1937, the Supreme Court upheld anti-business legislation that had been struck down by lower courts, like the National Labor Relations Act, in decisions like National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation. That made unions more powerful, led to a wave of costly strikes and discouraged hiring. The increased wages demanded by unions resulted in employers' laying off many workers instead of modestly trimming wages.
If government spending alone could end a recession, then why did the Great Depression deepen under Herbert Hoover, who increased government spending to $4.7 billion from $3.1 billion?
HANS BADER Senior Attorney Competitive Enterprise Institute Washington, Aug. 2, 2011
To the Editor:
I believe that the majority of Americans see that austerity is exactly the wrong fix for the economy and that we should be spending more, not less, to create jobs and tax revenues. But we must feel confident that Congress will have the fortitude to ease up on spending when the economy starts to improve, so as to address our undeniably frightening long-term budget problem.
Politicians, especially progressives, have a dismal record of ever cutting spending. As Joe Nocera rails at the Tea Party, we should ask whether the left's relative indifference to fiscal reality has played a part in giving the Tea Party its power.
MARK ROSENMAN Montclair, N.J., Aug. 2, 2011
To the Editor:
Everyone has a favorite culprit to blame for the unnerving debt-ceiling debate. Jacob S. Hacker and Oona A. Hathaway (''Our Unbalanced Democracy,'' Op-Ed, Aug. 1) reflect the opinion of many others in saying that we face ''a democracy crisis,'' that our system of government is ''dysfunctional.''
The difficulty of reaching an agreement on the debt ceiling undoubtedly justifies a review of some characteristics of Congress, like the routine use of the threat to filibuster in the Senate and the short two-year term of members of the House of Representatives, which makes them campaign continuously. But wholesale assertions that the system is dysfunctional cannot help us address solvable problems.
In historical perspective, the most unusual aspect of the debt-ceiling debate was the unwillingness of a large group of newly elected representatives aligned with the Tea Party to participate in the normal legislative process. Only the voters can deal with that problem.
GERHARD LOEWENBERG Iowa City, Aug. 1, 2011
The writer is professor emeritus of political science at the University of Iowa.

Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.
Museums
American Folk Art Museum: 'Super Stars: Quilts From the American Folk Art Museum' (through Sept. 25) This location is featuring 20 quilts in which stars figure in some way, whether as pieced-together geometric forms or as little tufts of thread that suggest a distant galaxy. American Folk Art Museum Lincoln Square Branch, 2 Lincoln Square, Columbus Avenue at 66th Street, (212) 595-9533, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)
- Asia Society and Museum: 'Ai Weiwei: New York Photographs 1983-1993' (through Aug. 14) The Chinese artist-provocateur Ai Weiwei, provisionally released from detention by the Chinese government in June, took the photographs in this exhibition while living in living in Manhattan for a decade. He moved there from China initially to study art, then casually began recording his daily life with a camera and ended up documenting his East Village neighborhood as it erupted in class warfare. The activist-artist under threat in China today was formed in New York then, as these coming-of-age photographs attest. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400, asiasociety.org. (Holland Cotter) 
- Brooklyn Museum: 'Lorna Simpson: Gathered' (through Aug. 21) Much of Lorna Simpson's photo-based work has been about African-American identity approached from an oblique and elusive perspective. She returns to that theme in new ways in the two installations and video that make up this small show, which includes some 300 framed photographs hung in grid formation on a long gallery wall. Roughly half the pictures are vintage 1950s pinup images of young black women (and a few men) alluringly posed in domestic settings. The rest are of Ms. Simpson herself, posed and dressed like the figures in the photographs, as if to suggest overlooked connections between the present and the past. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Cotter)
- Brooklyn Museum: 'Vishnu: Hinduism's Blue-Skinned Savior' (through Oct. 2) Hindu sculptures are no ordinary things. Concentrations of spiritual energy so dense as to turn physics inside out, they funnel light from other universes into our mundane world. The light takes a little time to penetrate this show, dauntingly crowded with objects, ideas and information. But it shines through in the end as we trace the many earthly forms taken by one of Hinduism's greatest gods and arrive at the spiritual matinee idol named Krishna. With his sapphire skin and sweet flute songs, he radiates devotional love, and everyone falls for him, including us. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Cotter)
Guggenheim Museum: 'The Hugo Boss Prize 2010: Hans-Peter Feldmann' (through Nov. 2) Mr. Feldmann, the septuagenarian German artist who was the surprise pick for the Boss Prize honors, has decided to exhibit his prize money in the form of 100,000 $1 bills, pinned to the wall of one of the Guggenheim's Tower galleries. What sounds on paper like a conceptual stunt or a riff on Warholian materialism becomes overpoweringly physical in person, thanks to the smell of the used bills and the traces of their circulation. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
Guggenheim Museum: 'Lee Ufan: Marking Infinity' (through Sept. 28) This five-decade retrospective fills the museum with about 90 works in a Zen-Minimalist, be-here-now vein by a Korean artist who lives in Paris and Japan. Sculptures consist of ordinary, pumpkin-size boulders juxtaposed with sheets and slabs of dark, glossy steel. Paintings made of wide brush strokes executed in gridded order on raw canvas exemplify tension between action and restraint. In its always near-perfect composure, Mr. Lee's art teeters perilously between art and decor. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Ken Johnson)
- International Center of Photography: 'Elliott Erwitt: Personal Best' (through Aug. 28) Like Henri Cartier-Bresson, Mr. Erwitt seeks ''the decisive moment,'' an instant in real time when people, animals or objects appear before the camera in surprising, funny and illuminating ways. The Henny Youngman of photographic one-liners, he delivers visual humor with such economy and grace that it is easy to overlook just how excellent an artist he is. This show presents more than 100 of his favorite images from the past seven decades. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Johnson)
International Center of Photography: 'Hiroshima: Ground Zero 1945' (through Aug. 28) The contact prints and photographs in this show were made in connection with the 1947 United States Strategic Bombing Survey of Hiroshima and depict the cataclysmic devastation in unflinching detail. The survey texts that accompany the images may appear shockingly clinical. The caption on a picture of a library, or what remains of it, reads: ''Interior first story showing contents damage and spalling of cement plaster by fire. Note all books reduced to ashes.'' 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Rosenberg)
Jewish Museum: 'Collecting Matisse and Modern Masters: The Cone Sisters of Baltimore' (through Sept. 25) This exhibition samples the extraordinary trove of European art amassed by two American spinsters in the first half of the 20th century, work now owned by the Baltimore Museum of Art. Although some major collection highlights are absent, the pieces here -- presented in the order of acquisition -- generate a compelling portrait of the Cones as collectors. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3337, thejewishmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'The Andean Tunic, 400 B.C.E.-1800 C.E.' (through Sept. 18) This small show celebrates the festive yet functional garments woven south of the equator. To the modern eye, they're wearable paintings; lovers of Keith Haring and Elizabeth Murray will find much to admire. So will anyone interested in the complex relationships among art, clothing, ritual and power. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Anthony Caro on the Roof' (through Oct. 30) No one in the 1960s produced groovier abstract sculpture than the British artist Anthony Caro, five of whose heavy metal assemblages grace the Met's Rooftop Garden. But only one of these works has that startling, newborn feeling. Sporting a new coat of shiny, taxicab-yellow paint, ''Midday'' (1960) has the look of a jaunty, industrial dinosaur. The others, dating from 1968 to 2010, show a development toward an increasingly conservative, ponderous monumentality. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Frans Hals in the Metropolitan Museum' (through Oct. 10) This small but potent show gathers the Met's 11 confirmed works by the great 17th-century Dutch painter, appending them with two outstanding loans and a selection of contextualizing works. It gives a remarkably full account of his talent and the painterly realisms -- vivacious to relatively restrained -- that he formulated. It also reveals an artist who viewed his subjects with a nonjudgmental equanimity, whether he depicted them singly or in groups, in dignified repose or unbridled revelry. As a result, a strange kind of gravity and sympathy for the human condition emanate from these works, raw as they can sometimes seem. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Mother India: The Goddess in Indian Painting' (through Nov. 27) Sculptures, paintings and drawings from the Met's collection represent manifestations of Devi, the Great Mother goddess who is thought to be the most popular of all Indian deities. Among works dating from the first millennium B.C. to 1990 are pieces of exceptional beauty, including a small, 12th-century argillite sculpture depicting the 16-armed Durga slaying her most fearsome opponent, Mahishasura, after he emerges from the lopped neck of his buffalo disguise. Carved in extraordinarily refined detail, it is a marvel of formal and metaphorical concentration. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Night Vision: Photography After Dark' (through Sept. 18) It wasn't until the gelatin dry-plate process was introduced in the late 1880s that exposure time was lowered enough for photographs to be taken regularly after dark. Alfred Stieglitz was among the first to photograph New York at night. His work is shown alongside Berenice Abbott's spectral ''Nightview, New York'' from 1932, taken from the window of a skyscraper; Brassai's nocturnal views of Paris; and Weegee's high-contrast picture of a crime scene. Diane Arbus, Bill Brandt, Robert Frank, Garry Winogrand and Kohei Yoshiyuki are among the other artists included in this modest, lovely show of 40 black-and-white photographs drawn from the museum's collection, which stops a couple of decades short of the present. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Poetry in Clay: Korean Buncheong Ceramics from Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art' (through Aug. 14) This beautiful exhibition presents bottles, vases, bowls and dishes made by 15th- and 16th-century Korean artisans. In shades of gray, from creamy and opalescent off-whites to deep, warm blacks, the anonymous craftsmen covered vessels with loosely rendered images of flora and fauna and fine-grained patterns of dots and tiny blossoms. These infectiously lively works look as if they'd been made not centuries but only decades ago. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Richard Serra Drawing: A Retrospective' (through Aug. 28) Few artists have pushed drawing to such sculptural and even architectural extremes as Mr. Serra, so it makes sense that his adamantine pursuit of the medium, surveyed in an installation that he largely designed himself, is not quite like anything seen at the Met before. There are moments of off-putting starkness on Mr. Serra's side and some of the usual architectural infelicities on the Met's, but as a demonstration of this august institution's willingness to engage with genuinely radical, physically unsettling art of recent vintage, the show is cause for hope. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
- MoMA PS1: Ryan Trecartin: 'Any Ever' (through Sept. 3) This game-changing show of seven related videos, viewed amid eccentric seating arrangements procured mostly from Ikea, reflects the combined imagination of a supertalented young artist and his band of merry, cross-dressing pranksters. The results teeter giddily at the intersection of art, reality television and social networking; forge an integration of video and installation art, not to mention a blend of actual life and animation undreamt of by Walt Disney; and evince an aspirational faith in the potential of uninhibited self-expression, both individual and collective, to counter the mounting materialism of everyday life. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, Queens; (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Smith)
MoMA PS1: 'Nancy Grossman: Heads' (through Aug. 15) Anyone passingly familiar with American art of the past half-century will recognize the eerie, erotically menacing, leather-clad heads that Nancy Grossman began producing in the late 1960s. Often including zippers, buckles, straps and chains, these lovingly made sculptures most immediately evoke S&M bondage wear. As presented in this strikingly elegant installation, 14 examples resonate on other metaphorical levels, too. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)
Morgan Library & Museum: 'The Age of Elegance: The Joan Taub Ades Collection' (through Aug. 28) This small but engrossing exhibition presents about three dozen works dating from the mid-17th to the late 19th centuries by European artists, each in his own way a draftsman of consummate skill. Some names, like Boucher and Millais, are familiar; most will be known only to art historical specialists. Ranging from postcard to laptop size, including portraiture, still-life and mythological scenes, they exemplify the fine but now endangered art of drawing at its best. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, Ext. 560, themorgan.org. (Johnson)
Morgan Library & Museum: 'Illuminating Fashion: Dress in the Art of Medieval France and the Netherlands' (through Sept. 4) Medieval illuminations -- so rich in narrative, embellishment and religious expression -- can display sartorial trends that can help experts date manuscripts and discern the subtleties of a figure's status or character. There are many examples here, as well as mannequins in full-scale model attire -- say, a splendid hunting ensemble of gold-embroidered blue velvet and lilac wool felt for the men, and for the women, a princessy gown of yellow silk trimmed in black crushed velvet, accessorized by a turret. This lively show will teach you to scrutinize centuries-old manuscripts as you would a style magazine. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, Ext. 560, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)
- El Museo del Barrio: 'El Museo's Bienal: The (S) Files 2011' (through Jan. 8) Because of a long renovation of El Museo del Barrio's Fifth Avenue building, four years have passed since the museum's last biannual survey of new Latino, Caribbean and Latin American art. As if to make up for lost time, the new edition is the biggest so far, including work by 75 artists spread over seven shows in four boroughs, with the main event at El Museo itself. The ''S'' this year is for ''Street,'' which covers everything from graffiti to junk sculpture to painted cityscapes, and some of the work has problems with focus. Yet taking the street as a subject opens the possibility to at least think about other subjects, like money for artists, and the lack of it. Other segments of the show are now on display at Socrates Sculpture Park in Long Island City, Queens, and Lehman College Art Gallery in the Bronx; a Brooklyn show is scheduled to start in November. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org. (Cotter)
Museum of Arts and Design: 'Otherworldly: Optical Delusions and Small Realities' (through Sept. 18) In the age of the flat screen, a show about the diorama sounds charmingly naive. Yet ''Otherworldly'' circles back to the two-dimensional image in ways that feel very sophisticated. A good number of the show's more than 40 artists build model homes, cities and landscapes mainly to photograph them. At times the exhibition feels like a Hollywood film-studio tour in miniature. 2 Columbus Circle, (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: 'I Am Still Alive: Politics and Everyday Life in Contemporary Drawing' (through Sept. 19) This show of contemporary drawings (most acquired since 2005) is anchored by a group of telegrams sent by the Japanese artist On Kawara to friends and associates; each one bears the message ''I am still alive.'' The artists seem to be in a permanent state of wariness and suspicion, which is sometimes the result of political instability and at other times more innate. But their efforts to process matters of life and death in short bursts of creative activity feel very of the moment. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Boris Mikhailov: Case History' (through Sept. 5) This exhibition's visceral photographs of homeless people in Ukraine are not for the squeamish. The 19 photos, large-format examples from a series of more than 400 images produced in the late 1990s, portray people in grungy rooms or in wintery outdoor sites naked or pulling aside their clothes to expose parts of their bodies. Thus Mr. Mikhailov protests a society that allows people to fall into such substandard states and conditions. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
- Museum of Modern Art: 'Talk to Me: Design and the Communication Between People and Objects' (through Nov. 7) This broad, ambitious survey of interactive design is made for the texting, tweeting, social-networking, app-downloading, smartphone-wielding museumgoer. Its nearly 200 projects include not only crowd-pleasing video games, robots and chattering objects but also some surprisingly seductive interfaces, charts and information systems -- each with its own hash tag. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)
- New Museum: 'Ostalgia' (through Sept. 25) This tough, absorbing exhibition fills all five floors of the New Museum with contemporary art from, or about, Russia and former Soviet bloc countries of Eastern Europe. A fair number of the artists are unfamiliar to New York; some have difficult, even harrowing histories. But a show that could have been a surveyish introduction to them is something more. It's an extended essay about what happens when art and life meet not because it's a cool idea, but because they have no choice: they either join forces or lose everything. New Museum, 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Cotter)
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Cory Arcangel: Pro Tools' (through Sept. 11) This solo turn from Mr. Arcangel, the digital wunderkind, artist-musician and inveterate hacker, seems a trifle scrubbed clean, sanitized and austere. Containing work almost entirely from 2011, it tells us little of his funkier early digital efforts or artistic development. A few pieces reflect his longstanding interest in television and video games; in others he tries too hard to establish his formalist bona fides with wry riffs on abstract painting and sculpture. Mr. Arcangel seems guided by a somewhat callow faith in the avant-garde, striving to perpetuate its tradition, dating from Duchamp, of laying claim to new areas of nonart for art's sake. Sometimes he succeeds, but not always. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Breaking Ground: The Whitney's Founding Collection' (through Sept. 18) In anticipation of its move to a new home in 2015, the Whitney is cooking up a series of six back-to-back experimental permanent collection shows at its present location. The first of them is a sampler of the earliest work in the holdings, and as a summary of the institution's initial view of American Modernism, what a curious thing it is. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Cotter)
- Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Lyonel Feininger: At The Edge of the World' (through Oct. 16) This overdue survey is a eye-opener, especially for the rapturous storybook street scenes that Feininger (1871-1956) painted from 1907 to 1911 -- fresh off his triumph as a comic-strip artist and with a big assist from Fauvism's heated palette -- and for the hand-carved and painted toylike figures and buildings that may be his most original response to Cubism. But the show diligently emphasizes the stiltedly mystical Cubified landscapes into which Feininger's painting style hardened after 1918. There's too little evidence of the photographs, woodcuts and pencil sketches that, with the carved sculptures, kept his natural, urbane lightness alive. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)

- Lyonel Feininger: 'Drawings and Watercolors from the Julie Feininger Estate' (through Oct. 15) On the occasion of the Feininger retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art, a gallery long involved with his career presents a parallel survey of works on paper from his widow's estate. It compensates for some of the museum show's shortcomings, most impressively with a gratifying profusion of small, lively woodcut prints from 1918-23 that will be unfamiliar to most viewers. Moeller Fine Art New York, 36 East 64th Street, (212) 644-2133, moellerfineart.com. (Smith)
Galleries: 57th Street
Leo Villareal: 'Volume' (through Aug. 19) You might just want to sit and gaze in blissful stupefaction at ''Cylinder,'' the single-light sculpture featured here. It consists of 160 12-foot-long lengths of shiny stainless steel, each with 140 light-emitting diodes, or LEDs, along one edge, hanging in five concentric circles to create a cylindrical volume nine feet in diameter. The thousands of computer-controlled lights flicker in the darkness, generating all kinds of patterns and a fascinating beauty. Gering & Lopez, 730 Fifth Avenue, near 57th Street, (646) 336-7183, geringlopez.com. (Johnson)
Galleries: Chelsea
Sol LeWitt: 'Arcs and Lines' (through Aug. 26) This extraordinary show features three gridded wall drawings by the eminent Conceptual-Minimalist Sol LeWitt (1928-2007), most prominently the airy and ebullient ''Wall Drawing #122'' from 1972, a spare work in blue crayon that wraps almost perfectly around the gallery's large central space. Featuring combinations of two straight, wavy, curved or broken lines in each compartment of the grid, its vaulting composition evokes Matisse's blue nudes, brisk Alpine views and even the blinking sweep of a radar screen, exemplifying both the economy and rich suggestiveness of LeWitt's art. Paula Cooper Gallery, 534 West 21st Street, (212) 255-1105, paulacoopergallery.com. (Smith)
'Perfectly Damaged' (through Aug. 17) The works by 20 artists in this evocative exhibition are only apparently damaged. Graham Collins subtly alters old, beat-up boards. Valerie Hegarty's portrait of George Washington looks as if it survived a house fire. Michael DeLucia pairs a real, much dented washing machine with a plaster simulation of its undamaged state, suggesting a comparison of the imperfectly real and the Platonic ideal. Derek Eller Gallery, 615 West 27th Street, (212) 206-6411, derekeller.com. (Johnson)
- Jason Polan: 'Living and Working' (through Aug. 12) This solo debut introduces an artist who is more or less drawing his way through life, as well as his own show. He will continue adding works to the display, which includes, among much else, a ''life-size'' drawing of the head of King Kong, a decorated but useable table-tennis table and (my favorite) a wall covered with smudgy drawings of dense black circles, large, medium and small. Nicholas Robinson Gallery, 535 West 20th Street, (212) 560-9075, nrgallery.com. (Smith)
- 'Sigmar Polke: Photoworks, 1964-2000' (through Sept. 3) If this genius of postwar German art, who died last summer at 69, had made no paintings, his wide-ranging photographic work would have assured him a prominent place in history. As proven by this generous survey -- the first in New York devoted to Polke's photography, the medium perfectly suited his mercurial sensibility. He exploited its ease, immateriality and darkroom processes; spiked it with his works in other mediums (as well as himself); and used it to make his every activity an occasion for making art. His talent for making something from nothing is never more magical. Leo Koenig Inc., 545 West 23rd Street, leokoenig.com, (212) 334-9255. (Smith)
- Jo Ractliffe: 'Terras do Fim do Mundo (The Lands of the End of the World)' (through Aug. 13) At first glance, this South African photographer's black-and-white shots of sun-baked Angolan landscapes look random and bland: rocks, dirt, scrubby trees; some handwritten signs but no people. Only when you read some of the titles -- ''Mass Grave at Cassinga,'' ''Minefield Near Mupa'' -- do you learn where people are, or once were, and the pictures snap into expressive focus. The Walther Collection Project Space, 526 West 26th Street, Suite 718, (212) 352-0683, walthercollection.com. (Cotter)
'Soft Machines' (through Aug. 26) This intermittently interesting show includes a video by the young Chinese artist Ma Qiusha, in which she tells how her parents pressured her to succeed as an artist; it ends with her removing a bloody razor blade from her mouth. A painting by Holton Rower resembles a giant tree slice with psychedelically colorized rings. And Sterling Ruby's pair of pointy-toothed mouths made of stuffed, stars-and-stripes-patterned fabric is like a Bread and Puppet theater prop. Pace, 545 West 22nd Street, (212) 989-4258, thepacegallery.com. (Johnson)
Galleries: SoHo
'The Atomic Explosion: A Collection of Vintage Photographs' (through Sept. 2) This show gathers 66 images of American nuclear tests and detonations, most of them conducted at the Nevada Test Site and on the Marshall Islands during the 1940s and '50s. The massing mushroom clouds in these images, photographed from miles away, are made to seem benignly organic. A giant portobello rises over Bikini Atoll; slender enokis sprout in Nevada. The news-service captions on many of the prints feel just as innocuous; one compares a double-capped cloud to ''a giant dumbbell.'' Peter Blum SoHo, 99 Wooster Street, (212) 343-0441, peterblumgallery.com. (Rosenberg)
Galleries: Other
- 'The Medicine Bag' (through Aug. 12) In this group show of tough little delicacies, differences between self-taught art, outsider art and well-schooled-insider art are pretty much indistinguishable, and artists of different generations, from Joseph Cornell and Lee Godie to youngsters like Paul Lee and Charles Harlan, look like contemporaries. Maccarone, 630 Greenwich Street, West Village, (212) 431-4977, maccarone.net. (Cotter)
'North by New York: New Nordic Art' (through Aug. 19) Emotional restraint is the rule with this diverse selection of works by 15 contemporary Scandinavian artists. Gunnel Wahlstrand's big, black-and-white, photorealistic ink drawing of a boy in jacket and tie reading at his bedroom desk is technically impressive and coolly depressing. Most engaging is a half-hour video like a home-movie scrapbook called ''My Life'' by Marja Viitahuhta. In a laconic voice-over, a fictional female narrator mentions significant events for each of her 99 years, ending with the stoic statement, ''I die.'' Scandinavia House, 58 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, (212) 779-3587, scandinaviahouse.org. (Johnson)
Public Art
'Mark di Suvero at Governors Island: Presented by Storm King Art Center' (through Sept. 25) With 11 works spanning more than three decades, this show organized by Storm King Art Center -- the 500-acre sculpture park in the Hudson Valley -- is Mark di Suvero's biggest New York City survey since 1975. The all-outdoor exhibition works alongside the island's packed calendar of activities and festivals, offering bike riders and picnickers culture by osmosis. Plan to spend some time along the island's southern end, where four of Mr. di Suvero's best sculptures engage the waterfront and one another in invigorating ways. Governors Island, govisland.com. (Rosenberg)
Eva Rothschild: 'Empire' (through Aug. 28) At the southeast entrance to Central Park stands a colorful, tubular structure resembling a swing-set frame designed by spiders on LSD. Touching ground at 10 points on the cobbled plaza, its red, green and black striped posts rise at different angles into an airy web over 18 feet at its highest point. A playful riff on the ancient form of the triumphal arch, ''Empire'' will be a required photo-op for tourists and other visitors. Doris C. Freedman Plaza, Central Park, 60th Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 223-7800, publicartfund.org. (Cotter)
Out Of Town
- Neuberger Museum of Art: 'Art in Cameroon: Sculptural Dialogues' (through Aug. 14) With 30 sculptures, two from the Neuberger's holdings, this show isn't large, but some of the pieces are spellbinders, given plenty of room to work their magic. Highlights are two figures, one of a man, the other of a woman, both elderly, found in the same area of Cameroon in 1910, taken to different collections in Europe and reunited here, in silent conversation, after some 75 years.

Last Chance
'Katherine Bernhardt, Alfred Jensen, Chris Johanson, Chris Martin, Andrew Masullo, Judith Scott' (closes on Friday) Among the group shows emphasizing abstract painting and paintinglike abstraction in Chelsea right now, this selection of works by six artists has an unusual cohesion, even though it lacks a catchy, encapsulating title. Its connecting tissues include strong color, loosely enforced geometries, a tactile use of materials and a high tolerance for reference and allusion to other two-dimensional conventions, including map making and weaving. A lively pictorial back and forth ensues. Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 534 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 744-7400, miandn.com. (Smith)
'Color Field Revised' (closes on Friday) More than two dozen works in this exhibition expand the view of a movement from a decade that had psychedelia, Asian spirituality and quantum physics infusing collective consciousness with mind-boggling new ideas about the nature of reality. Thomas Downing's stained Op Art; Karl Benjamin's luscious stripes; Darby Bannard's blue circle; and works by Kenneth Noland, Jules Olitski and Frank Stella project a spirit of perceptually charged hedonism. Loretta Howard Gallery, 525-531 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 695-0164, lorettahoward.com. (Johnson)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty' (closes on Sunday) A triumph for this British fashion designer -- who died at 40, by his own hand, last year -- and for the curator Andrew Bolton of the Met's Costume Institute, this career retrospective is ethereal and gross, graceful and manipulative, and poised on a line where fashion turns into something else. The operatic spectacle is pushed along by soundtrack of wind, Handel and orgiastic moans and has a holographic image of Kate Moss spinning like a moth in a flame at the center. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)
MoMA PS1: 'Laurel Nakadate: Only the Lonely' (closes on Monday) Laurel Nakadate might be on the cusp of a great new career. She is known for disconcerting, sad and sexually provocative videos that she enlisted older, worse-for-wear men to participate in, but in the past three years she has made two feature-length films. Included in this enthralling survey of her 10-year career, they focus with lingering, heart-aching care on adolescent girls, lost souls looking for love and only getting into trouble. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)
Neue Galerie: 'Vienna 1900: Style and Identity' (closes on Monday) One of history's more fraught fin-de-siecle efflorescences of art and thought is recounted in a shifting kaleidoscope of paintings, drawings, architectural models, posters and several species of decorative arts. Among paintings by Gustav Klimt, Oskar Kokoschka and Egon Schiele, there is also a re-creation of Freud's psychoanalytic couch, an eye-popping tribute to the Vienna Secession and a crowded face-off between the designer-theoreticians Josef Hoffmann and Adolf Loos. Over all, it resembles a tasting menu with enough rich and disparate flavors that the gaps and omissions can be overlooked. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Smith)
'Wu Tsang' (closes on Friday) Transgender identity, long the basis of a lifestyle, now the muscle behind a political movement, is finding a voice in mainstream art. The young artist Wu Tsang is one of its most visible representatives. Born in 1982, living in Los Angeles and self-identified as a ''butch queen in heels,'' he mixes art and politics in about equal proportions. A short film, set in a bar and called ''Damelo Todo'' (''Give Me Everything''), is the main event here. Clifton Benevento, 515 Broadway, near Spring Street, SoHo, (212) 431-6325, cliftonbenevento.com. (Cotter)
- B. Wurtz: 'Works 1970-2011' (closes on Friday) This wryly beautiful, morally invigorating retrospective highlights the playful, plain-spoken sculptures and wall pieces of the artist known by the gender-vague signature B. Wurtz. Cobbled together from carefully selected scraps of wood and wire, plastic grocery bags, food packaging, buttons, shoelaces and the occasional porcelain sink leg, his acts of ingenious recycling channel Duchamp and Calder while bringing existing materials and artistic thought into an unusually clear, mutually enhancing alignment. Against the profligacy of so much of today's art world, they constitute a quiet refusal, a rebellious act of abstinence that results in its own kind of fullness. Metro Pictures, 519 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-7100, metropictures.com. (Smith)

GRAPHIC: PHOTO: INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'ELLIOTT ERWITT: PERSONAL BEST': (through Aug. 28) Like Henri Cartier-Bresson, Mr. Erwitt seeks ''the decisive moment,'' an instant in real time when people, animals or objects appear before the camera in surprising, funny and illuminating ways, as in ''Florida Keys,'' above, from 1968. The Henny Youngman of photographic one-liners, he delivers visual humor with such economy and grace that it is easy to overlook just how excellent an artist he is. This show presents more than 100 of his favorite images from the past seven decades. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org.

HEADLINE: This Astronomical Recession

BYLINE: By JENNIFER FINNEY BOYLAN. 
Jennifer Finney Boylan, a professor of English at Colby College and the author, most recently, of ''Falcon Quinn and the Crimson Vapor,'' is a guest columnist. David Brooks is off today.

 BODY:
Belgrade Lakes, Me.
If the decrepitude of Neptune caused me to briefly lose my faith in America, it was the ingenious rings of Saturn that restored it for good.
Two weeks ago, on the day of the very last shuttle landing on Earth, I drove along Route 1, taking a good look at the Maine Solar System Model. This would be a scale mock-up of our cosmic neighborhood unveiled in 2003 and devised by Kevin McCartney, a geology professor at the University of Maine at Presque Isle, who built the thing because it ''seemed like a good idea'' at the time.
Driving the 40 miles from the Sun (at the university's science museum), to Pluto (in nearby Houlton), also struck me as a good way, as the government likely prepares to cut the nation's safety nets, to gauge the impact of the recession on Aroostook County, the state's northernmost county and one of its poorest. 
I saw plenty of signs of economic ruin -- boarded up businesses, burned-out houses. But there were signs of life as well, like the tough-looking farms surrounded by fields of yellow-white potato blossoms and, on a mountain range between Saturn and Uranus, the swiftly rotating sails of a brand-new wind farm.
''We built it ourselves,'' said Professor McCartney, meaning the universe. ''Around here we sort of take care of ourselves.''
Hardship is nothing new for ''The County'' (as everyone in Maine calls it). ''This area was never rich in the first place,'' explained the professor's wife, Kate, who runs a bed and breakfast. The county took its hit in the '90s when Loring Air Force Base closed. ''It's not as if things are so much harder than they were. They've never been easy in the first place.''
As I headed away from the three-story-tall cross-section sculpture of the Sun, the inner planets came swiftly. Each mile represents one astronomical unit, the distance between the Earth and the Sun; I passed the silver model of Mercury in 0.4 miles, followed by a red and white Venus outside the Budget Traveler Inn. There, Stephanie McIntosh, a desk clerk, said occupancy was down except during snowmobiling season and the Maine Potato Blossom Festival. The best part of the festival, she said, is the mashed potato wrestling contest.
A cloudless planet Earth, about the size of a navel orange, sat on the top of a pole outside of Percy's Auto Sales. Brian Rackliffe, a salesman there, told me sales have improved since the dark days of 2008. ''But they have a long, long way to go before we're back to normal.''
I found Mars by the ''Welcome to Presque Isle'' sign on the way out of town. From there, it was a long way to Jupiter. I passed fields of potatoes, hay and broccoli, and in a ditch near a lot filled with construction equipment, a model of Ceres that represented the asteroid belt.
Jupiter was by a sign marked ''Moose Crossing.'' Five miles beyond was Saturn, which had its own parking lot. It was hard not to be impressed by the planet, with its beautiful rings, built by students at local schools. ''Saturn weighs over a ton,'' Professor McCartney told me.
Next was Uranus, at the Bridgewater rec center, where a sign read, ''Congratulations Chloe Wheeler. 2011 Pre-Teen Miss Potato Blossom.'' Then there was Neptune, a blue basketball-size sphere another 12 miles down the highway, in front of a large garden of what looked like squash or pumpkin vines. Potatoes are still Aroostook County's No. 1 agricultural crop, but the industry has been in decline for years, the result of shifting consumer tastes and competition from other states, particularly cursed Idaho. As I looked up at Neptune, it was clear that the planet had been through a few rough years itself. Paint was flaking around its equator.
I'd been wondering how the people of Aroostook County would handle Pluto, since it had been downgraded from planet to dwarf planet in 2006. Professor McCartney admitted that the demotion had hit him hard. With a Mainer's mix of cussedness and generosity, he reacted to Pluto's degradation by putting up a second Pluto. He also added a model for Eris, another dwarf planet.
At the second Pluto, I met a woman who said she'd spent her whole life in Aroostook County. ''My son's the son of a potato farmer,'' she said, ''but he had to leave. Now he's a sea captain. It's always a problem, keeping the young people from going away.''
Earlier in the day, I had driven up to Limestone, Me., on the Canadian border, to the old Air Force base. Once it was a weapons storage area and home to the 42nd Bomb Wing. Now the whole area is called the ''Loring Commerce Centre,'' a name that I tried hard not to find ironic. As a storm came on, I drove past ruined, rusted hangars, fields of decommissioned military vehicles and a rotting structure with four towers resembling desolated, ruined minarets. After a couple of wrong turns, I accidentally wound up on the vast, wind-swept runway, as rain blew horizontally past my car and lightning struck the ground.
The skies cleared on my way to Eris. Driving, I saw the St. Croix River off to the east, and the green forests of Canada beyond, and a black Labrador retriever with a snake in its mouth.
When I finally found the dwarf planet, it was across the street from a shuttered general store and next to a veterans' memorial with a flagpole and no flag. But there was a new store a few doors down, selling fishing lures and cheeseburgers. Loggers were pulling their trucks into the parking lot, their rigs full of newly hewn timber.
I cast a glance north, toward the distant model of the Sun, and remembered something Kate McCartney had told me. ''People always think the end of the universe is coming,'' she said, referring not only to deadly asteroids but to the American economy as well. ''But we're more resilient than that. You drive the Maine Solar System Model, the speed of light is seven miles per hour.'' She smiled. ''At that speed, you have to believe everything is going to be all right.''

HEADLINE: Filmmakers Head to the Country, in Several Countries

BYLINE: By MIKE HALE

 BODY:
During my teenage years -- most of which I spent living and working on a quarter-section, corn-and-soybeans, last-of-a-dying-breed Iowa family farm -- I began to notice that my particular reality was not often reflected on screen.
When actors and directors did visit the country, it was flattering, but the results usually weren't very edifying. Reruns of ''Green Acres'' and ''Petticoat Junction,'' popular on local television stations, were guilty pleasures, watched with an embryonic, rural version of hip detachment. (For something closer to the real country experience, we had ''Hee Haw.'') 
From those early days I adopted a critical, perhaps even reflexively scornful, view of Hollywood's attempts to depict farm life. As an adult, in a packed theater in Des Moines, I watched Kevin Costner carrying a shovel in ''Field of Dreams'' -- a scene actually filmed outside Dyersville, Iowa -- and I didn't think, ''Nice corn.'' I thought: ''A shovel? In a corn field? What the heck is he going to do with a shovel in a corn field?'' No one around me seemed to be bothered by this, but what can you expect from city people?
Despite a clutch of slightly more realistic treatments during the farm-crisis period of the early 1980s (''Country,'' the TV movie ''Bitter Harvest''), I've remained mostly disappointed over the years. So it was with interest and hope that I examined the schedule of independent, heartfelt productions that make up the Rural Route Film Festival, running through Sunday at the Museum of the Moving Image in Astoria and the Brooklyn Grange Rooftop Farm in Long Island City, both in Queens.
The festival, which includes five features and several programs of shorts, has an elastic definition of ''rural,'' loose enough to include something like ''Our Footloose Remake,'' a D.I.Y. homage to the 1984 small-town teenage-rebellion musical ''Footloose,'' put together by 54 filmmakers. The films that are actually about agriculture range around the world, from Africa to Asia to the New Jersey Meadowlands and Red Hook, Brooklyn.
The lives of ethnic Tibetan nomads may seem remote from the row crops and feed lots of the American Midwest, but Lynn True and Nelson Walker's documentary ''Summer Pasture'' resonated with my own experience in some central respects. The economics of herding yaks apparently resemble those of growing corn: the prices you get keep coming down while the prices you pay keep going up. And just as the children of American farmers are always leaving for New York, the children of Chinese herders are decamping to Xining.
''Summer Pasture,'' a highlight of the festival (the film is scheduled to open on Aug. 15 at the Maysles Cinema in Harlem), is both an elegy for a dying way of life and a portrait of an amazingly resilient marriage. The real takeaway for a farm kid, though, was that all the rashes I got from handling chemical fertilizers didn't seem so bad once I had watched a Tibetan woman spreading out, by hand, huge piles of yak manure to dry.
Closer to home -- to my current home, anyway -- is Warner Wada's 30-minute ''Muskrat John,'' filmed hard by the New Jersey Turnpike in the ditches and marshes of what its subject, John Rohweder, still calls the Hackensack Meadows. It has nothing to do with farming, but once again it hits the entwined notes of necessity and change. For 30 years Mr. Rohweder trapped muskrats during the day while working on the railroad at night because he needed the money. Now he traps for love, in what little animal habitat remains after the encroachments of freeways, truck depots and football stadiums.
When it comes to American farm life, the primary vision put forward here is still not very familiar to a rural Midwesterner -- from my time or, I suspect, from today -- though it's doubtlessly sincere, and growing. My hopelessly old-fashioned response to a film like Severine von Tscharner Fleming's ''Greenhorns,'' a documentary tour of sustainable-agriculture enterprises, most of them covering an acre or two and none of them in the Midwest, is that it's about gardening rather than farming. For better or worse, it represents a conception of agriculture that's partly about economics and ecology, and partly about locavore cooking and all-around good taste.
That mix of practical and romantic notions is taken to an extreme in Ian Cheney's ''Truck Farm,'' in which he records his effort to create a working farm in the bed of a half-ton pickup parked on a Brooklyn street. There's a lot of forced whimsicality: toy animals filmed in stop motion, songs by the Fisherman Three that sound like children's rock. But Mr. Cheney also includes an interview with the locavore chef Dan Barber, who takes a baggie of greens and peppers for $3 -- Truck Farm transactions bear a strong resemblance to drug buys, only cheaper -- and then says of the project, ''It's probably a way too simplistic answer to a very complex problem.''
I finally found an analogue for my own farm-town experience, though with a lot more nudity, among the festival's copious shorts: Danny Wilcox Frazier's ''Driftless: Stories From Iowa,'' an online-video and photography project (at mediastorm.com) that is also shown as a 30-minute film. Mr. Frazier's black-and-white interview-and-photo collages have an artsy, self-conscious bleakness that comes from somewhere else (they're heavily influenced by Robert Frank and Bruce Weber) and occasionally seem to be staged. But they get to the heart of an anomie and a sense of endlessly declining fortunes that were as true 30 years ago as they appear to be today.
Nothing in the festival will ring more true for generations of former farm children than the offhand comment of a young woman in ''Driftless'': ''Moving from Iowa to Denver was just as easy as changing the brand of mascara I use.''
