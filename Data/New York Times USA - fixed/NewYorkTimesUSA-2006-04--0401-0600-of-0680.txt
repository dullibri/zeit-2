Oil Prices Reach Another Record Amid Concerns on Iran and Nigeria
The price of oil futures surged to a record yesterday, settling above $70 a barrel amid concern over Iran's nuclear program and production shortages in Nigeria. While there was no single reason for the increase in prices, oil traders have been responding to incremental developments from producers. With very little slack left in global oil supplies, small disruptions can have a large impact on the market. [Page C1.] 


Surging energy and gold prices dragged stocks lower. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 63.87 points, at 11,073.78. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 3.79 points, 1,285.33. The Nasdaq fell 14.95 points, to 2,311.16. [C11.]

An Era Ends as Weill Retires From Citigroup
Today, at the annual Citigroup shareholder meeting at Carnegie Hall, Sanford I. Weill will cross the stage and take his final bow as chairman. At a time when Wall Street seems to be increasingly dominated by the rise of hedge funds and private-equity firms run by nameless, faceless yet undoubtedly powerful financiers, Mr. Weill is a throwback. He is one of the last classic deal makers who broke many of the rules and rewrote history on Wall Street. Mr. Weill's successor, Charles O. Prince III, the chief executive, assumes the post of chairman today. [C1.]

New Services Field Aims to Keep Jobs in U.S.
To help educated young Americans find good jobs that will not be shipped off to India or China, more universities, corporations and government agencies are becoming involved in what is called services science.

After four years of criminal trials and accounting investigations, Tyco International agreed to pay a $50 million fine to the Securities and Exchange Commission to settle claims that the company inflated profits by more than $1 billion from 1996 through 2002. Two former Tyco executives who were implicated in the fraud -- L. Dennis Kozlowski, above, and Mark H. Swartz, Tyco's former chief financial officer -- were convicted last year of grand larceny, conspiracy, securities fraud and falsifying business records. They were sentenced to 81/3 to 25 years in prison and ordered to pay close to $240 million in fines and restitution. They are appealing the convictions. [C3.]

HEADLINE: New Chief of Staff Sends Message: The White House Exits Are Open

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 17 

 BODY:
The new White House chief of staff put the West Wing and official Washington on notice on Monday about potentially substantial changes in the way the White House is staffed and operates.
 Meeting first thing Monday with senior White House aides, the new chief, Joshua B. Bolten, said it was time to ''refresh and re-energize'' President Bush's team, the White House press secretary, Scott McClellan, said. Mr. Bolten also said anybody who was considering leaving within the year should step forward now, according to Mr. McClellan's account of the meeting.
Mr. McClellan, who faced questions from reporters about his own future, said Mr. Bolten did not ask directly for anybody's resignation. 
 But Mr. Bolten's decision to address the prospect of personnel changes so directly on his first full weekday at work, and the decision to make his message public, appeared to be a signal that he would move quickly to address Republican complaints that senior staff members were burned out and off their stride.
 Senior White House officials had spent months playing down the need for any substantial overhaul of administration personnel. Mr. Bolten's message seemed to suggest that Mr. Bush had now come around to the idea that his presidency needed some fresh faces, if not a fresh start. But it is not yet clear how wide and deep any changes will be, and whether they will portend new policy approaches or be limited to bringing in new voices to sell existing policies. 
 If the announcement sent a strong signal to restless party members that real change was coming, it also set off a round of what White House officials routinely deride as an inside-Washington game of personnel speculation. 
 In this case, the speculation extends to the senior levels of Mr. Bush's cabinet, including Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, who in the face of mounting criticism has received a ringing vote of confidence from Mr. Bush, and Treasury Secretary John W. Snow, who has not.
 As chief of staff, Mr. Bolten would conceivably have a say in their fates, as well as those of the 13 other cabinet secretaries and the 30 or so members of the president's leadership team.
 Republican allies said they welcomed the signal from the administration, not only the sentiment Mr. Bolten conveyed but also the way the White House shared it publicly. Mr. McClellan described the meeting, without prompting, speaking with reporters Monday. 
 ''It's a smart, savvy move,'' said Kenneth M. Duberstein, a Republican lobbyist. ''It's the symbolism and it's the message and it's the reality: they're serious about a revitalized, re-energized team.''
 Mr. Duberstein was part of another White House reorganization, in 1987, when President Ronald Reagan tapped him and several other seasoned Washington hands to revitalize his White House, then listing under low approval ratings, looming scandal and Congressional unrest. He went on to become chief of staff to Reagan.
 The Bush White House has had unusually low staff turnover and notably few public squabbles. One of the few messy personnel moves of his presidency, the firing of Paul H. O'Neill as Treasury secretary in 2002, was handled by Vice President Dick Cheney. But Mr. Bush is no stranger to the hatchet; he played a pivotal role in the forced resignation of his father's chief of staff John H. Sununu late in his father's term. 
 But Mr. Sununu's successor, Samuel K. Skinner, moved deliberately -- afraid to be too abrupt as Mr. Bush prepared for his re-election campaign -- and complaints continued into the last year of his term that the White House was beset by internal rivalries, squabbling and poor communications.
 Mr. Bolten has indicated he is not about to make the same mistake, though he is unlikely to be able to move with complete impunity. Unlike President Bill Clinton, whose inner circle changed continually given his political needs of the moment, Mr. Bush is known for loyalty and has kept his circle nearly intact since his days as Texas governor. 
 Still, Mr. Bolten's message Monday seemed certain to heighten the anxiety within the White House among some staff members worried about their own positions. Mr. McClellan said the president had given Mr. Bolten wide latitude to pursue staff changes as he saw fit. 
 Asked if Mr. Bolten had leeway to make decisions affecting cabinet posts, Mr. McClellan said, ''The president has given him the full authority to do what he needs to do, and what he believes is in the best interest of this White House and this president.'' 
 Beyond changes to the composition and structure of the West Wing staff, Mr. Bolten, along with other members of Mr. Bush's inner circle including Vice President Dick Cheney, will have to decide what to do about the two senior cabinet members most in the line of public fire right now, Mr. Rumsfeld and Mr. Snow.
 Mr. Snow has expressed an interest in stepping aside this year, and Republicans with ties to the White House have been floating the names of possible successors. Mr. Bush has strongly defended Mr. Rumsfeld against criticism from some former generals and a few Congressional Republicans that he mismanaged the war in Iraq. 
 Mr. McClellan said there were obvious places for Mr. Bolten to get started, like suggesting a successor to himself at the Office of Management and Budget. 
 Several Republican officials close to the White House, who were granted anonymity to speak freely about personnel decisions, said Mr. Bolten would also quickly turn his attention to two areas that are widely considered to be pressing problems: the White House's frayed relationships with Republicans on Capitol Hill and the troubles it has had communicating its message to the public and the news media.
 Mr. Bolten has some other jobs to fill, including that of domestic policy adviser, which was vacated last month by Claude A. Allen after he was arrested on charges of stealing from retailers. Filling that position could give him an opportunity to rethink the White House's domestic and economic policy operations, which have had trouble pushing Mr. Bush's agenda forward and have been criticized by some Congressional Republicans as not putting forward enough new initiatives.
 Mr. McClellan was asked during two news briefings on Monday whether he would resign.
 ''Are you trying to tempt me here?'' he replied jokingly at his afternoon briefing.
 After saying that his general policy of avoiding comment on what he terms ''personnel matters'' held for himself, as well, Mr. McClellan added, ''Two years in this position is a long time; I'm very mindful of that.''

HEADLINE: Profit Up for Wachovia and SunTrust

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Two large banks posted higher first-quarter profit yesterday, as strength in investment banking and trading offset slowing growth in consumer banking. 
 The Wachovia Corporation posted a 7 percent increase in profit, its lowest growth in five years, while SunTrust Banks reported an 8 percent gain, its smallest increase in more than two years.
SunTrust topped Wall Street forecasts, while Wachovia matched estimates.
 ''Results so far are consistent with strength in capital markets,'' said Mark Batty of PNC Advisors in Philadelphia. ''There is significant strength overseas, and volatility in interest rates and commodities is presenting attractive opportunities for trading.''
 Wachovia fell 80 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $55.05, and SunTrust fell 21 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $73.60. 
 Net income at Wachovia, based in Charlotte, N.C., rose to $1.73 billion, or $1.09 a share, from $1.62 billion, or $1.01. Excluding special items, profit was $1.12 a share, matching analysts' average forecast. Revenue rose 9 percent, to $7.06 billion, topping forecasts.
 ''We continue to see excellent sales production and robust pipelines'' despite a ''pretty tough interest rate environment,'' the chief executive, G. Kennedy Thompson, said.
 Lending income rose just 2 percent, but commercial loans increased 12 percent.
 Fees like commissions and service charges rose 17 percent, including a 30 percent jump in investment banking fees and a doubling of trading profit.
 Net income for SunTrust, based in Atlanta, rose to $531.5 million, or $1.46 a share, from $492.3 million, or $1.36. Analysts on average expected $1.43.
 Revenue was up 9 percent, to $2.05 billion, topping forecasts of $2.01 billion.

HEADLINE: Iceland's Fizzy Economy Faces a Test 

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

DATELINE: REYKJAVIK, Iceland, April 13 

 BODY:
It didn't take long for the 300,000 residents on this windswept fishing island to adjust to their mini-titan economy, where boutiques now sell Dior cosmetics and Gucci handbags and the flow of international money has been fueling a red-hot housing market and a crop of wealthy entrepreneurs. 
 Now, some of their new-found growth may be ebbing. It is a familiar situation to Icelanders, who have often experienced cycles of feast or famine in their fishing economy. But the downturn has caught the attention of critics from outside the country who argue that Iceland faces a financial disruption that could have repercussions far beyond its 40,000 square miles .
Iceland has undergone one of the fastest, fizziest economic transformations in the world in recent years. For the four years before last year, it was the best-performing Western stock market, and its growth rates had soared. Its large business interests have spread throughout Scandinavia. 
 But Iceland is facing fresh challenges. Some hedge funds and other global investors in the last several months have been concerned that the economy has overheated, and so they have withdrawn money from Icelandic markets. This pullback has caused the main stock index, the Icex 15, to fall 18 percent, and the currency, the krona, to weaken by about the same amount. 
 These declines, some analysts say, run the risk of driving away other investors, who had been lured by Iceland's attractive interest rates. This could prompt a downward spiral with larger repercussions. If nothing else, the analysts say, Iceland's own economy could be in for a rough patch, serving as a cautionary tale for other emerging markets.
 With a population on a par with a midsize American city and a gross domestic product of around $10.3 billion, or just below that of Rwanda, Iceland would not seem to be on the radar screen of many financial experts. But analysts from Merrill Lynch, Danske Bank, Fitch, Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service and many economists have weighed in with concern. Others say fears of an Icelandic meltdown are overblown.
 Nicolas Bouzou, the chief economist of Institut Xerfi, a research concern in Paris, feels that Iceland could be the ''butterfly's wing'' that sets off serious ripples in capital markets elsewhere in the world. 
 Mr. Bouzou said that ''many countries have the same macroeconomic configuration of Iceland,'' and if investors lose a great deal more money in Iceland, they could also pull out of other countries with similar economic structures. That configuration, he said, included a ''real estate bubble, very strong credit expansion and a very high commercial deficit.'' The same could be said of New Zealand, Australia and even the United States, he said.
 It is often a small event, Mr. Bouzou said, that sets off what he called ''systematic crashes.'' In this case, he said, the event could be a further decline in Iceland's currency or stock markets, or the country's inability to pay off some of its debt, which some believe is a possibility.
 The concern is ''not that Iceland directly causes other problems,'' said Brad Setser, a senior economist with RGE Monitor, a research firm in New York. Instead, Iceland could remind investors that ''things can turn around'' in countries with a big current account deficit, a hot housing market and an overvalued currency.
 For policy makers in Iceland who are new to the global economic stage and unaccustomed to being the focus of international criticism over their finances, the negative attention is prompting a mixture of soul-searching and defiance. Still, the state of Iceland's economy is better than it appears, said Thordur Fridjonsson, chief executive of Iceland's stock exchange. 
 Various countries around the world are experiencing similar adjustment pains, as institutional investors comb new markets for high yields, pumping liquidity into areas that have rarely if ever been the destination of outside money.
 One particular set of investors is stepping back: those who have taken advantage of Iceland's high interest rates by borrowing money in low-rate environments like Japan and purchasing higher-yielding Icelandic bonds. Their debt buying has helped Iceland's total corporate and household debt to double since 1990 to 350 percent of gross domestic product.
 None of Iceland's financial experts dispute that the economy is likely to slow, but they bristle at the notion that the situation could reach crisis level. They point to factors that make the country much less likely to succumb to a meltdown than others: The average age in Iceland is one of the lowest among developed nations, while its huge pension funds are 120 percent of its gross domestic product, a higher ratio than in Norway, which built up one of the world's largest pension funds from its oil wealth.
 About 65 percent of the profits from its largest companies come from outside of Iceland, tempering the effect of swings in the value of the krona. Iceland's financial regulator recently stress-tested its banks, and found they would still be solid after loan losses of 20 percent. Personal debt levels are very high, but so are homeownership rates.
 And local volatility, Icelanders argue, is a tradition. Fish harvests, after all, would be up one year and down the next, causing the krona and local fortunes to swing wildly.
 ''Only 10 years ago, when you had a good fishing year, everything was great,'' said Skarpheoinn Eiriksson, a salesman at Reykjavik's new Mercedes dealer. ''If you had a bad year, you wouldn't buy a car that year.''
 The Mercedes dealership sold eight of its most expensive sport utility vehicles last year, packed with extras. They each retail for about 10 million kronur, or $131,200, and most customers pay in cash.
 ''No one thinks things in Iceland can continue'' to grow as they have, said Halla Tomasdottir, the managing director of Iceland's chamber of commerce. But even with the slowdown, ''we do believe in our ability to handle it.'' The government has been raising interest rates to slow the economy and, it is hoped, borrowing.
 ''I do think we could deal with criticism more gracefully,'' she added.
 Iceland's harshest critics have come from Denmark, which for centuries held it as a colony until Iceland declared independence in 1944.
 ''Iceland looks worse on almost all measures than Thailand did before its crisis in 1997, and only moderately more healthy than Turkey before its 2001 crisis,'' Danske Bank analysts wrote in a report last month.
 Among the bank's main concerns is the current account deficit, or the difference between what Iceland sells and buys abroad.
 The Danske Bank report has earned the analysts who wrote it notoriety among Icelanders, a sarcastic cartoon in a local paper and scores of angry e-mails. Many Icelanders posit that the Danish report is payback by a former colonial ruler for the country's outsized recent successes, including the purchase in November by a group of Icelandic investors of Magasin du Nord, a department store that was one of the crown jewels of Danish business.
 The authors of the Danske Bank report were invited to Reykjavik last Wednesday to expand on their arguments and answer questions. The chief executive of Iceland's stock exchange, the central bank's chief economist and the head of research for its largest bank were on hand to provide their side of the story.
 About 300 people attended a shrimp and fish lunch in the Grand Hotel Reykjavik, a four-story concrete building. 
 Lars Christensen, one author of the Danske report, briskly summarized his thesis. ''Markets are increasingly focused on the financing of imbalances,'' he said, because ''global liquidity is getting tighter.'' And the countries with the biggest imbalances, he said, are Hungary, New Zealand and Iceland.
 ''I don't think Iceland is doomed,'' he said with a tight smile. ''With every good party there is a hangover.'' He pleaded with Iceland's banks to pull back on lending, the better to ''be able to start another party.''
 The question is when that new party will start, and whether the institutional investors who are now selling their Icelandic holdings will come back or more will depart. Global institutional investors sometimes move in skittish and highly unpredictable herds. Some embrace volatility; others find it makes them uneasy.
 Despite the concerns, Iceland's companies show no signs of backing down from the world stage. Take Straumur-Burdaras, a Reykjavik equity fund turned investment bank that invested in the Magasin du Nord purchase.
 The bank hopes to provide one-stop financial advice and lending for the midsize companies it serves. This year, it opened an office in Denmark and plans to expand throughout Scandinavia. The bank is modeling itself, said Thordur Mar Johannesson, the chief executive, on ''the largest investment banks in the world.''

HEADLINE: Russia Called Too Reliant On Petroleum

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

DATELINE: MOSCOW, April 17 

 BODY:
Russia's economic growth is masking signs of trouble that are characteristic of a petroleum-based economy, according to a World Bank report released Monday. 
 The report, though generally upbeat, reinforced warnings that Russia is relying too heavily on oil exports while allowing its manufacturing sector to wither. The country is the world's second-largest oil producer, after Saudi Arabia. 
The report found that the energy sector and consumer sales were strong but industrial output was leveling off, having reached a plateau after a few years of growth fueled by favorable exchange rates that resulted from the Russian economic crisis of 1998.
 The bank estimated Russia's gross domestic product grew 6.4 percent in 2005 compared with 7.2 percent a year earlier. Industrial production, however, increased only 4 percent compared with 8.3 percent the previous year.
 ''The vast majority of manufacturing sectors showed marked slowdowns in economic growth in 2005 relative to 2004,'' according to the report, the latest in a series released by the bank's Moscow office. 
 Underlying the troubles is the ruble's new strength. It is suddenly a rock solid currency because of Russia's oil exports. Factory directors now must pay workers and buy supplies in expensive rubles, undermining their competitiveness. Also, the oil economy is igniting inflation, which was 10.9 percent last year. 
 This paradox of good times is known as the Dutch disease for what happened in the Netherlands in the 1960's after the discovery of natural gas in the North Sea; Monday's report suggested symptoms are already appearing here. 
 The industrial slowdown also indicates a lack of investment, a separate problem gnawing at the economy for many years because of political uncertainty and high corporate taxes, according to the report and to independent economists. 
 For example, the average age of equipment in the electrical grid in Russia is 25 years, compared with 7 in the United States, said Yaroslav D. Lissovolik, chief economist at the United Financial Group, a Moscow broker. The inefficiency, breakdowns and higher maintenance costs all contribute to slower industrial growth. 
 ''The industrial sector was hit hard by lack of investment,'' Mr. Lissovolik said. 
 But Russia is accumulating cash as a result of its petroleum income. The country has created a windfall fund by setting aside any profit from oil sales at prices higher than $27 a barrel. 
 The bank recommended Moscow put the windfall fund into stocks and bonds outside of Russia. The pile of money, which reached $61 billion on April 1, is now kept in a ruble-denominated account in the central bank. 
 It is sometimes described as a safety net for the Russian budget if oil prices tumble. Also, Russian authorities have been reluctant to invest overseas for fear the money could be frozen by a foreign court in a lawsuit, the World Bank report said. 
 By investing the fund in stocks, a model followed by Norway, Russia could earn an additional $818 billion by 2030 when the fund would be worth $2.3 trillion, the bank estimated, following an economic model that predicts oil prices will drop gradually to $40 a barrel. 
 ''Future textbooks on Russian history will likely evaluate the economic policies of the current government to a large extent on how effectively it manages the country's growing oil wealth,'' the report noted.

HEADLINE: Giving Sacramento Good Reason to Have New Orleans on Its Mind

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA DREIFUS

 BODY:
Like many Californians, Jeffrey Mount, a geologist, has done a lot of thinking about water. 
 He grew up in Los Angeles and remembers trying to save neighbors' homes with sandbags during winter floods in 1969. As a young professor at the University of California, Davis, he watched a severe 1986 storm inundate Yuba City and Marysville.
''The surface of the earth is shaped by flood events,'' Dr. Mount, 51, said in an interview at this year's meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in St. Louis. ''However, it's mighty inconvenient when that water comes rushing through your backyard.''
 Avoidance of such calamities has been a central focus for Dr. Mount. In 1995, the University of the California Press published a textbook highly critical of river management practices in his state. Five years later, Dr. Mount became a maverick member of California State Reclamation Board, which oversees parts of the state levee system. 
 Last fall, after Dr. Mount publicly suggested that the city of Sacramento might be vulnerable to a Hurricane Katrina-like disaster, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger dismissed all the board members, Dr. Mount said. None had been appointed by him.
 Appointments ''are at the pleasure of the governor,'' said Sabrina Demayo Lockhart, deputy press secretary for the governor, adding that he had named ''a wide variety of individuals who have extensive knowledge about California's water management.''

Q. If you were making a bet, where would you say the next New Orleans will be?

A. I'd say the Sacramento area. The common denominator is concentrated urban development in the shadow of flooding and levees.
 You have around 400,000 people at risk from flooding, and the number will grow in the next few years because of intense development. 
 The city's main problem is that it is situated between the American and the Sacramento Rivers and at the base of the 12,000 foot Sierra Nevada range. Both rivers are prone to flooding. Additionally, powerful storms come in from the Pacific, slam against the mountains and dump heavy precipitation that ends up very quickly in the rivers. 
 Yet, around Sacramento -- the capital of the seventh largest economy in the world -- there's intense building on the flood plains. 
 Twenty miles downstream is the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, a maze of leveed islands and channels that flow into San Francisco Bay. Because of past agricultural practices, the delta is sinking. Parts are 20 feet below sea level, lower than anything in New Orleans. Still, there are proposals to put up 130,000 new homes in the delta.

Q. Why is there so much development in risky places?

A. Because the new gold rush in California is real estate. Moreover, local governments are often reluctant to exert controls over developers because of the tax revolution.
 Do you remember Proposition 13 in 1978, which limited increases in property taxes on existing homes? It decimated the ability of localities to fund services. So money for basic services that people expect is now raised through growth. 
 Many municipalities have become very aggressive about development. I heard a Northern California county supervisor say that his county needed development on its flood plain to fund flood control projects. 

Q. New Orleans was inundated after its levee system was breached by floodwaters. How strong are the levees around Sacramento?

A. They offer a very low level of flood protection, probably the lowest for any major metropolitan area in the country. That assessment comes from the Army Corps of Engineers.
 The New Orleans levees were rated as having a 200-year level of flood protection. That's a 1 in 200 chance that the levees will be overwhelmed in a given year. Sacramento's levees are rated at less than half of that.

Q. You are a geologist by trade. How did you get appointed to the California State Reclamation Board?

A. About 10 years ago, I wrote a textbook, ''California Rivers and Streams.'' In it, I discussed some of the unwise ways we try to manage our rivers in my home state. I think the book may have been part of why, in 2001, Gray Davis appointed me to the board. It oversees flood control for roughly half the state.
 Once there, I questioned the wisdom of putting so much new housing behind levees and onto flood plains. My colleagues and I did something that Reclamation Board members hadn't before done: we asked to see environmental impact statements for some of these developments. 
 We said, ''If you're going to build all these houses in flood-prone areas, show us your flood protection plans.'' I was especially concerned about planned housing developments in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta because a large part of California's water supply flows through it. If you had a disaster there, the drinking water of 23 million Californians would be at risk. 
 No one in the governor's office -- not Davis or Schwarzenegger -- ever told us to shut up. 
 But after a while you heard local officials and developers grumbling that our board was antigrowth.

Q. Are you still a member of this Reclamation Board?

A. Nope. We got terminated by the Terminator, all six board members.
 After Hurricane Katrina, I got media calls, asking, ''Could this happen here?'' I answered, ''We have much in common with New Orleans -- except Sacramento has less than half the level of flood protection that New Orleans supposedly had.'' 

Q. Weren't you appointed by Governor Schwarzenegger's predecessor?

A. Yes. And the governor certainly has the right to appoint his own people to state entities.
 Interestingly, since Katrina he's been speaking about the need for strengthening the levee system, which I take as a sign that the board's questioning did get some issues into the public square.

Q. Do you believe that strengthening the levees is a good idea?

A. In principle, yes. A lot of our levees are in terrible shape -- full of beavers and squirrels and rot. They were originally put up to protect farms. They were never built to protect big population centers. I am concerned, however, that strengthening the levees might spur the development of environments that probably should be left alone -- like the delta.
 When prospective homeowners see levees behind property, they feel satisfied that someone has addressed flooding dangers. They naively believe that the government wouldn't let them live where it wasn't safe. 
 Few comprehend that the levees don't prevent flooding; they just reduce its frequency. Levees often give people a false sense of security.

Q. Do you regret your service on the Reclamation Board?

A. Not at all. We've got to get more scientists involved in this sort of thing. Before I sat on this board, I had no idea how flood policy worked. I thought I did, but everyday reality is very different. It's a series of compromises. It's messy.
 And it's good for scientists to get into that. If nothing else, it's good for scientists to be present when the professional staff comes before the board and gives the facts, as they know them. Scientists can ask the technical questions that might not otherwise get raised. So regrets? Nope! Besides, I still have my day job at the University of California, Davis. There, I've got tenure!

HEADLINE: I Love My Hybrid, Even on the Highway

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Life in the Green Lane,'' by Jamie Lincoln Kitman (Op-Ed, April 16), about the pros and cons of hybrid cars: In contrast to Mr. Kitman's portrayal, my Honda Civic Hybrid gets exceptional fuel economy on the highway if I drive ''patiently.'' 
 I own both hybrid and nonhybrid Honda Civics. The nonhybrid gets 30 to 38 miles per gallon, doing much better with highway driving than in stop-and-go traffic.
But my hybrid does very well on the highway, as long as I keep the speed about 56 miles per hour. At this speed, I get 46 m.p.g. This is as good or better than my fuel economy with city driving. 
 But when the speed approaches 70 miles per hour, my fuel economy drops to about 39 to 40 m.p.g., barely better than my nonhybrid.
 One feature that helps the Honda Civic and Toyota Prius hybrids in the city is that their engines quietly shut off when you come to a stop. It is remarkable how much gas is wasted at stoplights and in gridlock.
 In Seattle, we joke that hybrids are the only cars that go below the speed limit.

HEADLINE: I Love My Hybrid, Even on the Highway

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Jamie Lincoln Kitman's April 16 Op-Ed article points clearly to the need for Congress to act before hybrid technology is corrupted. 
 If Congress were to raise the corporate average fuel economy, or CAFE, standards, the auto industry would receive a clear, unambiguous signal from our elected officials that this country is serious about kicking our addiction to oil.
 Of course, maybe Congress believes that kicking our oil addiction is a political slogan, not a desired national policy.

HEADLINE: Death, Alienation and Rural Deprivation, but With Style 

BYLINE: By KEN JOHNSON

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, April 14 

 BODY:
Near the end of ''Andrew Wyeth: Memory and Magic,'' an exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, hangs a painting unlike any other in the show. It depicts a girl in a thickly padded, leather-upholstered seat of a private airplane, looking down through an oval porthole and a rift in the clouds to a white house and barn on the ground.
 A wall label explains that the airplane in the painting is used by the Wyeth family to commute between homes in Pennsylvania and Maine. This reveals something about one of America's most widely beloved painters that his art mostly conceals: that he is a wealthy landowner who lives in a well-insulated world of financial ease and privilege. 
The world evoked in the rest of the exhibition is rather different. Finely painted in muted greens and browns with stark contrasts of lights and darks, it is a place stripped bare of the comforts of money and modern convenience, where crusty, hardworking farmers and fishermen endure the hard facts of life and death with stoic grace. Mr. Wyeth's vision of honorable rural deprivation ostensibly runs in opposition to much of what counts as the successful good life in modern America. 
 More an introduction to Mr. Wyeth's seven-decade career than a full-scale retrospective, the exhibition was organized by Anne Classen Knutson for the High Museum of Art in Atlanta in conjunction with the Philadelphia Museum. Some of Mr. Wyeth's most famous pictures, like ''Christina's World,'' are missing, but the 58 paintings and about 40 watercolors and drawings give a good sense of what he has been about.
 Impressive technique and cinematic compositions have a lot to do with the perennially healthy market for reproductions of Mr. Wyeth's paintings. Going through this exhibition, you would have to be a pretty determined Wyeth opponent to resist his Magic Realism and his cannily economical ways of composing scenes and telling stories.
 A wonderful 1944 picture of a furtive lobster poacher, hauling a trap on an inky black night by the glow of the phosphorescent water, reminds you that Mr. Wyeth learned his trade from one of America's great illustrators: his father, N. C. Wyeth.
 ''Groundhog Day,'' from 1959, shows Andrew Wyeth at the height of his powers. In the foreground is a table set with a white plate, cup and saucer and knife on a flat table. Wintry light spills through a window just behind, and through the window you see brown grass, a barbed-wire fence and a huge log with a jagged end and a chain wrapped around it. A remarkable orchestration of light, space and texture, it is also richly symbolic: outside there is violence and death; inside a sacramental order and the light of an austere divinity. The window, a recurrent motif in Wyeth, both connects and separates the realms of inner culture and outer wildness. 
 One reason Mr. Wyeth's work may remain popular despite its often foreboding astringency is that it is always elegantly stylish. ''Groundhog Day'' would make a fine illustration for a Pottery Barn ad. Insert a model in rugged clothes, and you would have a Ralph Lauren ad. (People in his portraits, to which a room in the exhibition is devoted, look like fashion models: handsome but opaque and, though painted with much detail, somehow unreal.) 
 Mr. Wyeth is preoccupied with death. A picture painted in 1942, when Mr. Wyeth was associated with Magic Realist painters like Paul Cadmus and Ivan Albright, depicts a dead crow among weeds and grasses painted with an extreme lucidity. A painting from 1982 showing a bearded man lying in profile in a white-planked dory at sea is one of a number of portraits of dying friends in the exhibition. But the scary and ugly facts of death are erased in Mr. Wyeth's pictures in favor of a mournful poetic beauty. 
 Call it Martha Stewart existentialism. Mr. Wyeth's paintings conjure a vision of rustic life in which bleakness is more than offset by attractive design. He creates an imaginary place where viewers can experience an authentic, elemental and meaningful simplicity that is hard to find in ordinary life. The art historian Michael R. Taylor notes in his catalog essay that admirers who visit ''Wyeth country'' in reality are often disappointed to discover ''telephone poles, modern houses and cars, rather than the unspoiled countryside they expect.'' 
 Only one painting in this show evinces social consciousness. ''Public Sale'' (1943) is a sad, distant view of a crowd gathered for the auction of a neighbor's home after his wife's death; it is like an understated Thomas Hart Benton painting. But nowhere else here is there a sense of community or politics, as there almost always is in the art of that other immensely popular American painter, Norman Rockwell. 
 That Mr. Wyeth edits out a lot of information is not in itself a problem. All artists edit, select and abstract from their observations or fantasies. In the work of Edward Hopper, whom Mr. Wyeth admires above all other American artists, the elimination of distracting detail enhances the dreamlike mystery of his lonesome rooms and houses.
 Mr. Wyeth's editing does serve to generate melancholy and otherworldly moods. But when you view a lot of his paintings together, the world he constructs starts to seem too airlessly tasteful and imaginatively closed up, like the inside of a house kept so neat and tidy that it suggests nobody lives there.
 In addition to the airplane picture, one other painting, from 1999, lets in a bit of the outside world. From the windows of an old widow's walk, the lights of cars streaming through the night along a distant highway are visible. The traffic is a breath of fresh air. At 88 Mr. Wyeth is not likely to change, but wouldn't it be interesting if he were to explore the vulgar modernity that his romantic isolationism ordinarily keeps at bay? 

''Andrew Wyeth: Memory and Magic'' remains at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, 26th Street and the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, through July 16; (215) 235-7469.

HEADLINE: Markets Slide as Prices of Energy and Gold Move Higher

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Surging gold and energy prices dragged stocks lower yesterday as inflation fears curbed Wall Street's enthusiasm over solid first-quarter earnings from Citigroup.
 Although Citigroup's upbeat results fed optimism about corporate earnings for the latest quarter, investors again focused on inflation and interest rates after comments from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago president, Michael H. Moskow, indicated that he felt the central bank must remain ''vigilant'' with its policy of raising rates to stem price increases.
Without new data to gauge the economy's health and only a handful of earnings reports, Wall Street turned its attention to the commodities markets, where oil prices topped $70 a barrel and gold lingered at a 25-year high. But despite the threat of rising raw material costs, the inflation picture has remained somewhat positive recently, said Russ Koesterich, portfolio manager at Barclays Global Investments. 
 ''Core inflation has stayed relatively contained,'' Mr. Koesterich said, adding that this week's reports on wholesale and consumer inflation should indicate where prices are increasing and draw a reaction from Wall Street.
 At the close of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 63.87 points, or 0.57 percent, at 11,073.78. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 3.79 points, or 0.29 percent, to 1,285.33. And the Nasdaq composite index sank 14.95 points, or 0.64 percent, to 2,311.16.
 Bonds rebounded from last week's slide, with the 10-year Treasury note rising 10/32, to 964/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, slipping to 5 percent from 5.04 percent late Thursday. The dollar was mixed against other major currencies, and gold prices soared past $600 an ounce.
 Political tension in Iran and Nigeria and concerns about shrinking gasoline reserves in the United States drove crude futures to their highest levels since hurricanes shut down much of Gulf Coast production late last summer. A barrel of light crude jumped $1.08, to settle at $70.40 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 Aside from data on home building and inflation this week, investors will be focused on corporate earnings. About half the Dow Jones industrials are scheduled to report this week and investors will be looking for clues as to how companies have dealt with higher interest rates and the upswing in oil prices.
 ''It's ultimately going to come down to how companies are responding'' to all of these pressures, said Jack Caffrey, equities strategist for J. P. Morgan Private Bank. ''It's worth noting that second- and third-quarter expectations have ticked higher over the past week or so.''
 Citigroup's earnings grew 3.6 percent, to $1.12 a share for the quarter, with strength in stocks and fixed-income returns helping it beat analysts' average estimate of $1.02 a share. Citigroup added 30 cents, to $48.35.
 Elsewhere in the sector, the Wachovia Corporation said its quarterly profit gained 7 percent on higher overall revenue and fees. Adjusted earnings of $1.12 a share matched Wall Street's target, but Wachovia slid 80 cents, to $55.05.
 The discount broker Charles Schwab posted a 68 percent increase in quarterly earnings, to 19 cents a share, as revenue climbed to its highest levels since the dot-com era. Charles Schwab dropped 25 cents, to $17.34.
 Tyco International said it had agreed to pay regulators $50 million to settle accounting fraud charges, but did not admit any wrongdoing. Tyco fell 8 cents, to $25.93.
 Following are the results of yesterday's auctions of three- and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: Weld's Income Fell in 2005; House Sale Raised Pataki's

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 17 

 BODY:
William F. Weld lost a bundle in Kentucky last year while Gov. George E. Pataki made a mint in Florida, according to tax returns the two Republican politicians released on Monday. 
 Mr. Weld, the former Massachusetts governor, who is campaigning to succeed Mr. Pataki, lost all of a $530,000 investment in Decker College, a Kentucky trade school that fell into bankruptcy last year shortly after Mr. Weld resigned as its president. Decker is mired in a federal fraud investigation in connection with student loans.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Weld, Andrea Tantaros, said on Monday night that a $327,524 capital loss listed on Mr. Weld's return was also related to Decker, through a stake owned by his investment firm, Leeds Weld & Company. 
 Mr. Pataki and his wife, Libby, reported record taxable income last year of $775,169, up 47 percent from the year before, thanks to a windfall profit from the sale of a property in West Palm Beach, Fla. 
 The Patakis bought the Florida home in May 2004 for $360,000 and sold it last October for $675,000, for a gross profit of 88 percent in 17 months.
 A spokesman for the governor said Mr. Pataki had no connections, political or otherwise, to the buyer, Peter Clarke of Fairfax Station, Va. ''The Patakis didn't know the person that they bought it from and didn't know the person that they sold it to,'' said the spokesman, David M. Catalfamo. 
 Mr. Pataki's real estate agent, Chip Lubeck, did not return a telephone call seeking comment, nor did the only Peter Clarke listed in Fairfax Station. 
 Chappy Adams, president of Illustrated Properties, an independent real estate company in Palm Beach County, said Mr. Pataki's timing ''was probably pretty good.''
 ''In May '04 it was starting to get heated up, and last October was probably when the market was just starting to cool off,'' Mr. Adams said.
 Such a quick strike is not unheard of, he added, but ''definitely above average,'' even in Palm Beach's overheated market of the recent past. 
 Mr. Weld and his wife, Leslie Marshall, a writer, reported taxable income of $540,077 in 2005, a sharp falloff from almost $2 million a year earlier. Their total federal tax bill was $130,781.
 The drop in income was related to various factors, including the sale of an apartment in 2004 that increased Mr. Weld's income that year. His salary and the proceeds from his wife's business were also higher that year.
 Regarding Decker, which led to more than $850,000 in combined capital losses in 2005, Mr. Weld has said he had no knowledge of wrongdoing. ''I'm not aware that anyone has asserted that I did anything improper,'' he said in December, ''or that I condoned anyone else doing anything improper.''
 The Patakis reported total income of $889,123, including nontaxable income.
 That dwarfs their income before Mr. Pataki was elected to the first of his three terms as governor. A dozen years ago, the Patakis' taxable income totaled $121,000 from Mr. Pataki's work in the State Assembly and as a lawyer. Inflation adjusted, that is equivalent to nearly $160,000 today, a bit less than their federal tax bill alone. 
 Today, they own four properties in New York State, including their main residence in Garrison and a farm in Essex County. They also are investors in office buildings in Albuquerque and Atlanta. 
 Mrs. Pataki, who lists her occupation as ''consultant/adviser,'' reported income of $222,665. That included $70,000 from a charity, the Wheelchair Foundation, and $80,000 from a company controlled by the philanthropist Ronald S. Lauder, who has been a supporter of Mr. Pataki. She also earned $17,300 for two speeches, one to a California company called Inland Energy and the other to the Orange County Conference for Women, also in California.
 Mr. Pataki saw his side career as a paid speaker blossom: the return says he gave 10 speeches for a total of $144,210 to audiences outside the state, including the law school of the University of Southern California and the Greater Miami Jewish Federation. 
 Not everything worked out for the Patakis last year. Mrs. Pataki's children's book, ''Madison in New York,'' featuring a dog named New Yorkey, was something of a fiasco. The owner of a Yorkshire terrier who created a character named the Real New Yorkie for a line of greeting cards threatened legal action, and Mrs. Pataki agreed to not write any more New Yorkey books. 
 About $2,000 in legal bills connected with the book outstripped the $367 in proceeds.

HEADLINE: Justices Weigh Whether Railroad Retaliated Against Worker

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 17 

 BODY:
There was no disagreement in the Supreme Court on Monday about what happened to a railroad maintenance worker named Sheila White after she complained to a manager that she was being sexually harassed by her immediate supervisor.
 Ms. White, the only woman working in the maintenance department at the Tennessee Yard of the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway in Memphis, was reassigned from her job operating a forklift to the dirtier and less desirable job of repairing track. Soon after that, after she filed a complaint for retaliation with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, she was suspended for insubordination and went without pay for 37 days before a union grievance procedure led to her reinstatement with back pay.
The question for the Supreme Court in a lively three-way argument was whether that sequence of events amounted to retaliation by the railroad against Ms. White in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Title VII of that law, which protects workers against discrimination on the basis of race and sex, also prohibits retaliation against those who complain about discrimination. But neither the statute nor Supreme Court precedent offers a definition of retaliation. 
 There is ''no more vexing set of issues'' in employment law than those presented by retaliation cases, Carter G. Phillips, the lawyer for the railroad, told the justices. He noted that retaliation complaints filed with the E.E.O.C. have doubled in the last 10 years, now accounting for some 30 percent of the agency's docket. The definition of retaliation is ''plainly a fundamentally important question,'' Mr. Phillips said.
 The case found the players in unusual positions before the court.
 It was the railroad that brought the Supreme Court appeal, after losing to Ms. White in a jury trial and being ordered to pay her $43,500 in compensatory damages for retaliation. Yet the railroad is embracing the definition of retaliation that the jury used and that the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit invoked in affirming the verdict: that to establish retaliation, a worker must have suffered ''a materially adverse change in the terms of employment.'' The railroad's argument was that the appeals court had misapplied the standard, and that Ms. White suffered no such significant change.
 Ms. White's lawyers, while asserting that she could prevail under any standard, are arguing that the appeals court set the threshold too high. They say that any retaliatory action should be prohibited without having to rise to any particular level of significance.
 In giving employees protection against retaliation, Ms. White's lawyer, Donald A. Donati, told the court, ''Congress anticipated only that retaliation would be as varied as the human imagination.''
 ''I worry about that,'' Justice Antonin Scalia interjected. ''That is the problem. Juries can have wonderful imaginations.'' He asked Mr. Donati: ''Is there no test that eliminates the trivial action,'' like a hypothetical retaliation suit based on a manager's failure to say ''good morning'' to an employee who had made a discrimination complaint.
 Mr. Donati said there should be a general test of ''common sense'' and context. It was common sense, he said, to conclude that it was a change for the worse for Ms. White to go from operating a forklift to ''pulling up railroad ties.''
 Mr. Donati urged the justices, under whatever standard they adopt, to refrain from announcing a ''bright line rule'' under which some retaliatory practices would be deemed automatically lawful. That would give employers a ''safe harbor'' and create ''serious harm to the underlying primary rights,'' he said.
 At the time the case was litigated, the E.E.O.C. applied an employee-friendly standard of its own, defining retaliation as ''any adverse treatment'' that had a retaliatory motive and was ''reasonably likely to deter'' employees from making complaints in the future.
 But in its brief in this case, Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Company v. White, No. 05-259, the Bush administration repudiated that standard, which the agency had adopted during the Clinton administration. There must be a ''materially adverse change in the terms, conditions or privileges of employment,'' the solicitor general's office told the court. 
 But while this appeared to be a position that favored the railroad, the administration also argued that Ms. White's case in fact met that standard, and that she should prevail. It appeared likely that she would, one way or another, but that whatever standard the court adopts may have a greater impact when applied in a future case.
 Mr. Phillips, the railroad's lawyer, who was making his 50th argument before the court, ran into resistance when he tried to argue that neither Ms. White's reassignment nor her temporary suspension amounted to prohibited retaliation. 
 ''She wasn't hired as a forklift operator,'' he said, making the point that both her old and new duties fell within the description of her job category and so should have offered no basis for complaint. Ms. White suffered ''no direct economic effect,'' Mr. Phillips observed.
 Justice David H. Souter was skeptical. ''So any employer would be well advised to have one really nice job and one really rotten job within a category,'' he said, adding: ''Isn't there a difference between sitting on a forklift and picking up steel rails with your bare hands? Do you agree that 'direct economic effect' can't be the only criterion?''
 Mr. Phillips acknowledged that under the Supreme Court's precedents, an atmosphere of harassment can be so ''pervasive and severe'' as to amount to a change in an employee's working conditions, even in the absence of a ''tangible'' action by the employer. But that was not this case, he said.
 Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg noted that Ms. White suffered severe stress and had to seek medical help during her 37-day unpaid suspension. Even though she eventually received back pay, Justice Ginsburg said, ''nothing compensated her'' for that experience.
 Mr. Phillips said Ms. White's anxiety did not count as a ''tangible employment act.'' The back pay ''cured'' the problem as a legal matter, he said.
 While Title VII covers both discrimination and retaliation, the two fall under separate provisions that are worded somewhat differently. An underlying question in the case is whether Congress intended the same legal standard to apply to both, as the railroad and the solicitor general argued, or whether the retaliation provision was meant to be more open-ended, as Ms. White's lawyer argued.

HEADLINE: The Fire This Time: A General's Report

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:

The Battle for Peace
A Frontline Vision of America's Power and Purpose
By Gen. Tony Zinni and Tony Koltz
Illustrated. Foreword by Tom Clancy. 233 pages. Palgrave Macmillan. $24.95.
 No one was more prescient about the problems that could ensue from the present Bush administration's invasion of Iraq than Gen. Tony Zinni, the former commander in chief of United States Central Command (Centcom) and Mr. Bush's former envoy to the Middle East.
As early as 1998 (when neoconservatives began agitating for the removal of Saddam Hussein), General Zinni was warning that ''a weakened, fragmented, chaotic Iraq'' could be ''more dangerous in the long run than a contained Saddam.'' And in 2002, as the war drums beat louder and louder in Washington, General Zinni warned that invading Iraq could create more enemies for America in the Middle East, stretch the American military too thin, strain relations with allies and cost billions of dollars for reconstruction. 
 General Zinni, who as commander of Centcom had prepared contingency plans for the possible fall of Mr. Hussein, also recommended that if an invasion of Iraq were pursued, it should rely upon ''overwhelming force,'' and that a comprehensive plan for reconstruction be adopted before the war. His outline of such a plan (dealing with the protection of infrastructure, the sealing of borders, political fallout and an assortment of economic and social issues) was dismissed at the Pentagon, the New Yorker writer George Packer has reported, on the grounds that its assumptions were ''too negative.'' 
 In ''Battle Ready,'' the 2004 nonfiction book he did with Tom Clancy, General Zinni reflected that ''in the lead-up to the Iraq war and its later conduct, I saw, at a minimum, true dereliction, negligence and irresponsibility; at worst, lying, incompetence and corruption.'' And given the general's outspoken comments in recent public appearances -- he was one of the first in a widening circle of retired generals to call for Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld's resignation -- the reader might well expect his new book, ''The Battle for Peace'' (written with Tony Koltz), to be peppered with lots of provocative, news-making observations.
 It's not. General Zinni reiterates some of the criticisms he has voiced in speeches and interviews: at one point, comparing the wars in Iraq and Vietnam, he draws an analogy between the Gulf of Tonkin incident and Mr. Hussein's alleged weapons of mass destruction. But for the most part he soft-pedals particular complaints about the administration's conduct of the war. 
 For instance, in writing about national security strategy, General Zinni sidesteps questions about the Bush doctrine of pre-emptive intervention, noting only that it has been ''applied inconsistently and haphazardly.'' And in discussing the Pentagon's efforts to effect a ''transformation'' of the military, he does not delve into Mr. Rumsfeld's determination to streamline forces and his fateful decision to go to war in Iraq with far lower troop levels than many experts (including General Zinni) recommended.
 The bulk of this book is willfully focused on the big picture -- on long-term strategies for dealing with global crises and emerging threats. Although General Zinni manages to anchor his more abstract arguments in knowledge he has acquired on the ground -- leading troops in Vietnam, commanding rescue operations in Somalia, heading a special operations section of the Marines, in addition to serving as Centcom commander and special envoy to the Middle East -- he often leaves the reader wanting more specifics and more close analyses of situations he knows firsthand (like the one in Iraq and the Israeli-Palestinian standoff).
 His central theory is that the world changed not on Sept. 11, 2001, but in 1989, with the end of the cold war, which created seismic changes (comparable to those left in the wakes of World War I and World War II) and a dangerous new environment of global instability. ''We expected a new world order of peace and prosperity,'' he writes of the collapse of the Soviet Union. ''We could not have been more wrong. Instead of global peace and prosperity, all the snakes came out, with consequences that are still unfolding.'' 
 Change and flux, he reminds us, accelerated in the closing decade of the 20th century and the opening years of the 21st. Globalization held out the promise of worldwide economic development but also threatened to increase economic inequalities and feelings of exploitation on the part of the third world. At the same time, old ideas of sovereignty were being challenged by a proliferation of ''non-state entities'' (like terrorist networks and drug cartels), while old ideas of nationalism were being challenged by religious, ethnic and tribal identities.
 The real threats to the United States, General Zinni writes, come not from military forces or violent attacks; nor do they derive ''from an ideology (not even from a radical, West-hating, violent brand of Islam).'' Rather, they come from ''instability and the chaos it generates,'' which, he says, will sooner or later ''wash onto our shores.'' 
 As General Zinni sees it, the United States is not only slow to react to burgeoning problems around the world, waiting for crises to metastasize before taking action, but is also hobbled by an outmoded ''governmental system, organizational structure and national strategy that had served admirably and successfully during the 50 years of cold war but had not evolved to adapt to the changes that swept in after its collapse.'' 
 In the course of this volume General Zinni offers some suggestions for remedying this situation: from forming ''an integrating agency'' that ''would be responsible for monitoring unstable areas, destabilizing conditions and emerging threats'' to creating more multilateral initiatives involving other countries, international agencies and nongovernmental organizations. Though many of these recommendations sound sensible and are articulated in clear, no-nonsense language, they are presented in only the sketchiest and most general terms.
 ''The Battle for Peace'' feels, in the end, less like a full-scale analysis than a warning, a warning that deserves serious consideration, given General Zinni's Cassandra-like foresight on matters like Iraq.
 With the end of the cold war, ''violence may hit us -- as it hit London in 2005, and as it hit us in 2001,'' he writes. ''But the violence will not be a World War III knockout blow.'' Instead, there will be ''hundreds of little'' blows (ranging from terrorist attacks and global health epidemics to job losses and oil shortages), fueled by the growing instabilities of the world. 
 ''We're now in the position of the man who slept with a cobra,'' he argues. ''The cobra is gone. Now the room is full of bees. Could those bees kill him? Possibly. Possibly not.'' But they present the specter of a ''death of a thousand stings.''

HEADLINE: Fed Signals Policy Shift On Rates

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 18 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve hinted Tuesday that it might stop its campaign to raise interest rates as early as next month, a possibility that set off a surge in stocks even as crude oil prices rose above $71 a barrel.
 According to a summary released Tuesday of the Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Markets Committee meeting in late March, ''most members thought that the end of the tightening process was likely to be near, and some expressed concerns about the dangers of tightening too much.''
The overall tone of the summary, or minutes, also suggested that Fed officials were fairly confident that underlying inflation pressures would remain low despite high energy prices and a relatively low unemployment rate of less than 5 percent. 
 Stock and bond investors reacted as if a burden had been lifted. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 195 points, or 1.76 percent, to close at 11,268.77. The Nasdaq composite index jumped 45 points, or 1.95 percent, to 2,356.14. [Page 8.]
 Officials suggested that, after nudging up short-term interest rates 15 times in nearly two years, the increase in May might be the last one for some time. Since June 2004, the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks has climbed from 1 percent to 4.75 percent. 
 To be sure, Federal Reserve officials carefully hedged almost all their assessments with cautionary warnings and the need for continued vigilance against rising prices. They also kept their options open, reiterating their intention to base decisions on incoming economic data.
 At one point during the March meeting, some policy makers expressed concern that investors might misconstrue their message and infer that the central bank would raise interest rates several more times.
 Indeed, in recent weeks, many investors had been betting that the central bank would raise them two more times, once in May and once in June, largely because economic growth and job creation rebounded sharply in the first three months of 2006.
 But the minutes from the March meeting, by contrast, indicate that Fed officials were not alarmed about overheated economic growth and a spiral of wage and price increases.
 According to the minutes, officials noted that ''the labor market was now showing some signs of tightness.'' They also saw ''few signs that any added tightness in product and labor markets was adding to inflation pressures'' and suggested that wages and prices were being held down by foreign competition.
 ''Some meeting participants expressed surprise at how little of the previous rise in energy prices had appeared to have passed through to core inflation measures,'' the summary of the meeting recounted.
 Janet L. Yellen, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and a voting member of the Fed's policy-setting committee, voiced a similarly relaxed view in a speech on Tuesday.
 ''Although inflation is in the upper portion of my comfort zone, it appears to be well contained at present, and my best guess for the future is that it will remain well contained,'' she said in remarks released by the Federal Reserve. 
 In a clear indication that the long series of rate increases was nearing an end, Ms. Yellen added that the overnight federal funds rate ''is close to a neutral stance, one that neither stimulates the economy nor restrains it.''
 Federal Reserve officials primarily worry about the pace of ''core'' inflation, which excludes the volatile price fluctuations of food and energy, and the core rate of inflation remains below 2 percent. 
 On Tuesday, the government reported that producer prices, the prices charged by wholesalers, climbed at a rapid pace of 0.5 percent in March. 
 But most of that jump was the result of gasoline prices surging 9.1 percent. 
 Excluding energy and food, wholesale prices climbed only 0.1 percent last month.
 Laurence H. Meyer, a forecaster at Macroeconomic Advisers and a former Fed governor, said the central bank was sending two messages: first, that it was almost ready to stop raising rates; but second, that it would make its decisions on the basis of incoming economic data. 
 The focus on incoming economic data has increased steadily over the last year, as the Federal Reserve has pushed interest rates back up from the rock-bottom lows in 2004. At that time, Fed officials made it clear that rates were far too low to allow for sustainable growth without inflation. 
 But as the central bank gradually pushed up borrowing costs to levels more in line with historical norms, each additional decision to raise rates has become somewhat more dependent on the signs of growth and inflationary pressure.
 In minutes from the Fed's policy meeting on Jan. 31, which were released in late February, officials offered a comparatively oblique hint about ending the rate increases by noting that ''policy seemed to be fairly close to where it needed to be.'' 
 The minutes from last month's meeting, by contrast, bluntly recount that most members of the policy-setting committee thought the end of the ''tightening process'' was near and some warned about the dangers of ''tightening too much.''

Stocks Rise as Federal Reserve Suggests That It May Stop Increasing Interest Rates
The Federal Reserve hinted that it might stop its campaign to raise interest rates as early as next month. According to a summary released yesterday of the Fed's policy meeting in late March, ''most members thought that the end of the tightening process was likely to be near, and some expressed concerns about the dangers of tightening too much.'' [Page C1.] 


Stocks rallied after the Federal Reserve minutes suggested that its 21-month-old policy of higher interest rates might be coming to an end. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 22.32 points, to 1,307.65. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 194.99 points, to 11,268.77. The Nasdaq composite index increased 44.98 points, to 2,356.14. All three indexes had their biggest increase since April 21 of last year. [C8.]

McDonald's Dollar Menu Raises Sales and Concerns
The enormous success of the McDonald's Dollar Menu has helped stimulate positive comparable-store sales growth at the company for 36 consecutive months. In three years, McDonald's revenues have increased 33 percent and its shares have rocketed 170 percent, a remarkable turnaround for a company that only four years ago seemed to be going nowhere. But there may be a hidden cost. McDonald's has marketed the Dollar Menu -- which includes double cheeseburgers, the fried McChicken sandwich and French fries among its choices-- to teenagers, young adults and minority groups that are already plagued with an especially high incidence of obesity and related health problems like diabetes.

HEADLINE: Political Clout In the Age Of Outsourcing

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
A FEW years ago, stories about a scary new kind of outsourcing began making the rounds. Apparently, hospitals were starting to send their radiology work to India, where doctors who make far less than American radiologists do were reading X-rays, M.R.I.'s and CT scans. 
 It quickly became a signature example of how globalization was moving up the food chain, threatening not just factory and call center workers but the so-called knowledge workers who were supposed to be immune. If radiologists and their $350,000 average salaries weren't safe from the jobs exodus, who was? 
On ABC, George Will said the outsourcing of radiology could make health care affordable again, to which Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York retorted that thousands of American radiologists would lose their jobs. On NPR, an economist said the pay of radiologists was already suffering. At the White House, an adviser to President Bush suggested that fewer medical students would enter the field in the future.
 ''We're losing radiologists,'' Representative Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat, said on CNN while Lou Dobbs listened approvingly. ''We're losing all kinds of white-collar jobs, all kinds of jobs in addition to manufacturing jobs, which we're losing by the droves in my state.''
 But up in Boston, Frank Levy, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, realized that he still had not heard or read much about actual Indian radiologists. Like the once elusive Snuffleupagus of Sesame Street, they were much discussed but rarely seen. So Mr. Levy began looking. He teamed up with two other M.I.T. researchers, Ari Goelman and Kyoung-Hee Yu, and they dug into the global radiology business. 
 In the end, they were able to find exactly one company in India that was reading images from American patients. It employs three radiologists. There may be other such radiologists scattered around India, but Mr. Levy says, ''I think 20 is an overestimate.''
 Some exodus.
 URBAN myths feed off real fears, and this myth caught on because Americans don't know quite what to think about globalization. There is no doubt that trade makes countries richer, but it also creates victims. And since the country is doing almost nothing right now to ease the burden of those victims -- the people whose jobs really have gone to India or another country -- it is easy to become scared. 
 Radiologists seem like just the sort of workers who should be scared. Computer networks can now send an electronic image to India faster than a messenger can take it from one hospital floor to another. Often, those images are taken during emergencies at night, when radiologists here are sleeping and radiologists in India are not.
 There also happens to be a shortage of radiologists in the United States. Sophisticated new M.R.I. and CT machines can detect tiny tumors that once would have gone unnoticed, and doctors are ordering a lot more scans as a result. 
 When I talked last week to E. Stephen Amis Jr., the head of the radiology department at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, he had just finished looking at some of the 700 images that had been produced by a single abdominal CT exam. ''We were just taking pictures of big, thick slabs of the body 20 years ago,'' Dr. Amis said. ''Now we're taking thinner and thinner slices.''
 Economically, in other words, radiology has a lot in common with industries that are outsourcing jobs. It has high labor costs, it's growing rapidly and it's portable.
 Politically, though, radiology could not be more different. Unlike software engineers, textile workers or credit card customer service employees, doctors have enough political power to erect trade barriers, and they have built some very effective ones.
 To practice medicine in this country, doctors are generally required to have done their training here. Otherwise, it is extremely difficult to be certified by a board of other doctors or be licensed by a state government. The three radiologists Mr. Levy found in Bangalore did their residencies at Baylor, Yale and the University of Massachusetts before returning home to India. 
 ''No profession I know of has as much power to self-regulate as doctors do,'' Mr. Levy said.
 So even if the world's most talented radiologist happened to have trained in India, there would be no test he could take to prove his mettle here. It's as if the law required cars sold here to have been made by the graduates of an American high school. 
 Much as the United Automobile Workers might love such a law, Americans would never tolerate it, because it would drive up the price of cars and keep us from enjoying innovations that happened to come from overseas. But isn't that precisely what health care protectionism does? It keeps out competition.
 For now, the practical effect on radiology is small. At its highest levels, the United States health care system may be the best the world has ever known. India doesn't even have many radiologists today, let alone a large number who measure up to American standards. 
 But that's going to change. Eventually, Indian doctors will be able to do the preliminary diagnoses that are a big part of radiology. Something similar will happen in accounting, architecture, education, engineering and the law, as Mr. Levy and his colleagues suggest in the coming Milken Institute Review. 
 These fields tend to be regulated already, giving them noble excuses -- like certification, client privacy and legal accountability -- to put up trade barriers. But the real reason will usually be a simple desire to protect jobs and salaries.
 When factory workers have asked for that kind of protection, the country has told them no. So why does the answer change when the request comes from a wealthier, more influential group of workers?

HEADLINE: Boys Are No Match for Girls In Completing High School 

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
Nationwide, about 72 percent of the girls in the high school class of 2003 -- but only 65 percent of the boys -- earned diplomas, a gender gap that is far more pronounced among minorities, according to a report being released today by the Manhattan Institute. 
 The report, ''Leaving Boys Behind: Public High School Graduation Rates,'' found that 59 percent of African-American girls, but only 48 percent of African-American boys, earned their diplomas that year. Among Hispanics, the graduation rate was 58 percent for girls, but only 49 percent for boys. 
''It's a fairly large difference, particularly when you consider that unlike differences across racial and ethnic groups, boys and girls are raised in the same households, so it's not so easy to explain the differences by their community, or their income level,'' said Jay P. Greene, an author of the report. 
 Mr. Greene helped set off widespread national alarm with findings several years ago that almost one in three high school students, and almost half the African-American and Hispanic students, did not complete high school. His research has been widely embraced by policy makers, though some researchers argue that his method overstates the dropout problem over all and among minorities in particular. 
 Mr. Greene's new report found that New York ranks third from last among the states, with 58 percent of its students graduating. (Georgia and South Carolina are lower.) New York also has the lowest African-American graduation rate, 38 percent, and the lowest Hispanic graduation rate, 29 percent.
 The report compiles data on high school graduation, by school district, state, race and sex. The researchers say it is the first study to offer such a complete picture of the gender gap, in part, because information broken down by sex has only recently been available. 
 Among educators, it is common knowledge that girls outperform boys in high school and are more likely to go on to college. But Mr. Greene's study is among the first to compile broad data on the trend in high school completion by district, state and race. 
 ''This is the first time we've been able to compile this by our method,'' Mr. Greene said. ''We've seen that high school girls outperform boys on other measures, and they're all symptoms of the same disease.''
 By Mr. Greene's calculations, none of the nation's 10 largest school districts, which together educate more than 8 percent of American public school children, graduate more than 60 percent of their students. 
 Among the nation's 100 largest school districts, the Manhattan Institute report found, New York City had the third lowest overall graduation rate, 43 percent. The two lower districts were Detroit and San Bernardino, Calif. 
 In New York City, 47 percent of the girls and 39 percent of the boys graduated from high school. Among Asian-American high school students in New York, 68 percent of the girls and 54 percent of the boys got diplomas, as did 43 percent of the African-American girls and 33 percent of the African-American boys, and 37 percent of the Hispanic girls and 30 percent of the Hispanic boys. 
 Graduation rates have long been one of the most slippery topics in education, with districts choosing their own ways to account for, or ignore, students who drop out, are pushed into equivalency programs or simply leave the district. 
 Mr. Greene's findings are based on school districts' data that states report to the federal government. His findings have come under fire from other researchers, including Lawrence Mishel of the Economic Policy Institute. Mr. Mishel emphasizes that he, too, believes that African-American and Hispanic graduation rates are alarmingly low, but he says that Mr. Greene's work seriously exaggerates the problem. 
 In a recent opinion article in Education Week, Mr. Mishel estimates that 73 percent of African-Americans get high school diplomas. He bases his calculations on data from census surveys. He also cites studies from New York City and Florida finding graduation rates at least 10 percentage points higher than Mr. Greene finds. Mr. Mishel says high school graduation rates have been improving, especially among blacks. In contrast, Mr. Greene says graduation rates have been relatively flat for years. 
 The disagreement among the researchers is partly about different sets of data. It also mirrors political differences between the conservative Manhattan Institute, which favors school choice, and the liberal Economic Policy Institute, which has strong ties to unions. 
 ''They're using two different types of data, and each has its own problems,'' said Claudia Goldin, a Harvard economics professor who does her own education research. ''The truth lies somewhere in between.''

HEADLINE: Salads or No, Cheap Burgers Revive McDonald's

BYLINE: By MELANIE WARNER

 BODY:
On a recent afternoon at McDonald's in Union Square in Manhattan, Chris Rivera and Shamell Jackson reviewed the menu, which includes a variety of healthy options, including salad and fruit. Then they each ordered the usual: two McChicken sandwiches from the Dollar Menu, fries and a McFlurry shake. 
 The two 15-year-olds, like many of their classmates at the nearby Washington Irving High School, go to McDonald's often. And it is customers like Mr. Jackson and Ms. Rivera, consistently ordering the cheaper and more fattening items on the menu, who have fueled a remarkable resurgence at McDonald's.
 ''When I was younger, my mom never used to let me come here,'' said Mr. Jackson, standing in a register line 15 deep and filled with teenagers. ''She thought it was nasty. But I've got my own money now.'' 
 The enormous success of the Dollar Menu, where all items cost $1, has helped stimulate 36 consecutive months of sales growth at stores open at least a year. In three years, revenue has increased by 33 percent and its shares have rocketed 170 percent, a remarkable turnaround for a company that only four years ago seemed to be going nowhere.
 McDonald's has attracted considerable attention in the last few years for introducing to its menu healthy food items like salads and fruit. Yet its turnaround has come not from greater sales of healthy foods but from selling more fast-food basics, like double cheeseburgers and fried chicken sandwiches, from the Dollar Menu. 
 While that may have helped many low-income customers save money, there could be a heavy health cost. McDonald's has marketed the Dollar Menu to teenagers, young adults and minorities who are already plagued with an especially high incidence of obesity and related health problems like diabetes.
 Many nutritionists say fast food is one of the worst things in the American diet, because of its calories, trans fats, lack of fiber and added sugars and processed carbohydrates. ''If you're looking at the Dollar Menu in terms of how much food you get it really appears as a good bargain,'' said Connie Schneider, a nutrition adviser for Fresno County in California. ''But if you're looking at it as how many nutrients are you getting for a dollar, it's the least economical.''
 McDonald's says it seeks to provide options for its customers, at both low and higher prices. ''We're proud of the choices we offer customers,'' said Bill Lamar, chief marketing officer for McDonald's United States business. ''You can come in and order Apple Dippers, salads with low-fat dressing, yogurt, or you can order an Egg McMuffin, which is a very nutritious sandwich. People can make the decisions about how to eat for themselves.''
 True, McDonald's has persuaded millions of mostly female customers to buy its healthier, higher-priced salads. ''We are improving our relevance with products like salads, which cast a favorable glow over our brand and the rest of our menu,'' boasted McDonald's chief financial officer, Matthew Paul, in a conference call with analysts in July 2004.
 In 2005, salad sales totaled 173 million units, about even with salad sales in 2004. Per month, however, sales have slipped from 14.7 million salads in 2003 to 9.6 million in 2006. 
 And every day, McDonald's moves a lot more double cheeseburgers than either salads or the new Premium Chicken Sandwich -- most versions of the sandwich have more calories and more sodium than a double cheeseburger. Richard Adams, a former McDonald's executive who now works as a consultant for franchisees, says the average store sells roughly 50 salads a day and 50 to 60 Premium Chicken Sandwiches, compared with 300 to 400 double cheeseburgers from the Dollar Menu. 
 Reacting to the success of McDonald's Dollar Menu, Wendy's and Burger King both started promoting their versions of low-priced deals. Wendy's, which in 1989 was the first burger chain to experiment with menu items for $1, lowered prices on its Super Value Menu to 99 cents in January. And in February, Burger King started offering its own version of a dollar menu, including the Whopper Jr. and cheeseburgers.
 The Dollar Menu became a permanent part of McDonald's menu in the United States in late 2002. It offers items like a double cheeseburger, the fried McChicken sandwich, French fries, a hot fudge sundae, pies, a side salad, a yogurt parfait and a 16-ounce soda. 
 Since McDonald's started advertising the Dollar Menu nationally, the double cheeseburger has become the chain's most ordered item. Even priced at $1, double cheeseburgers bring in more revenue than salads or the chicken sandwiches, which cost $3.19 to $4.29.
 McDonald's executives say the Dollar Menu has driven enormous additional traffic into the stores, primarily young men and women aged 18 to 24. ''The Dollar Menu appeals to lower-income, ethnic consumers,'' said Steve Levigne, vice president for United States business research at McDonald's. ''It's people who don't always have $6 in their pocket.''
 Just three and a half years ago, McDonald's was struggling mightily. Its stock had tumbled 56 percent in 10 months and the company had reported its first quarterly loss. Sales at existing stores in the United States, by far McDonald's biggest market, were not growing and in many instances were declining. 
 Stung by obesity lawsuits and criticism from books like ''Fast Food Nation,'' the company's brand seemed passe and the high-calorie, high-fat, high-sodium cuisine appeared poised for a long decline. 
 But that did not happen. Today, McDonald's business, both in the United States and globally, is growing; the chain gets some one million more American visitors a day than it did just a year ago.
 Other factors have contributed to this turnaround, which has been surprisingly speedy for such a large company. McDonald's has been opening fewer stores and sprucing up restaurants and improving service. The chain has placed a greater emphasis on breakfast and introduced a successful global marketing campaign with the ''I'm Lovin' It'' tagline. But McDonald's says one of the most important factors in its newfound success has been its low-priced staples. 
 Dollar Menu ads aimed at young blacks and Hispanics often focus on how much hearty food can be bought for just $1, a message many young consumers are eager to hear. 
 ''The problem here is that you're dealing with a segment where you have these huge obesity issues and you're making eating Big Macs and double cheeseburgers look like it's fun and exciting,'' said Jerome Williams, a professor of advertising at the University of Texas, Austin, and one author of an Institute of Medicine report last year on the marketing of junk food to children and teenagers. 
 David Ludwig, director of the obesity program at Children's Hospital in Boston, calls marketing fast food to blacks and Hispanics a ''recipe for disaster.''
 ''Fast-food consumption has been shown to increase calorie intake, promote weight gain and elevate risk for diabetes,'' Dr. Ludwig said. ''Because African Americans and Hispanics are inherently at higher risk for obesity and diabetes, fast food will only fuel the problem.'' 
 According to an analysis of government data published this month in The Journal of the American Medical Association, 45 percent of non-Hispanic blacks and 36.8 percent of Mexican-Americans aged 20 and over are obese, as opposed to 30.6 percent of non-Hispanic white adults. 
 Blacks and Hispanics are also more likely to suffer from obesity-related diseases. Blacks are 1.8 times as likely to have Type 2 diabetes than whites, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Mexican-Americans, the largest Hispanic subgroup, are 1.7 times as likely. And 42.9 percent of blacks have cardiovascular disease, while 33.3 percent of whites do, according to the American Heart Association. 
 Obesity and related diseases also carry a high financial cost. Problems created by obesity increase the nation's health care costs by $93 billion a year, mostly from Type 2 diabetes and heart disease, according to a 2003 study done by RTI International in North Carolina. 
 McDonald's agrees that Hispanics and blacks are core customers. The company gets 17 to 18 percent of its sales from each group. In the overall United States population, blacks represent 12 percent and Hispanics 14 percent, according to the Census Bureau. 
 Mr. Lamar, McDonald's marketing executive, points out that the company has worked with Dr. Rovenia Brock, a popular African-American fitness guru, to promote physical activity. Mr. Lamar also says the company market its salads to black women, who have the highest rates of obesity of any segment of the population.
 Last May, the company ran a commercial featuring four African-American women talking about the McDonald's fruit and walnut salad and getting their ''fruit buzz.'' The ad ran on BET, the Black Family Network and ''Girlfriends'' on UPN.
 But Professor Williams at the University of Texas says the majority of McDonald's ads aimed at blacks feature Quarter Pounders With Cheese, Big Macs and French fries. McDonald's says that it advertises all its products equally across all markets and that over the last three years the most advertised menu items were Premium Chicken Sandwiches, McGriddles breakfast sandwiches and premium salads. 
 Marketing experts say McDonald's, which has long been proud of its inclusive advertising, is among the most shrewd when it comes to reaching blacks and Hispanics. The company's ads aimed at black consumers tend to be stylish and use hip contemporary language and music.
 ''Look who's trying to add some flavor to her life,'' says a young black man wearing an earring, silver chain and baseball hat that match his sweatsuit as he eyes a black woman dressed in a business suit ordering a Spicy Chicken Sandwich. The ad, which ran on BET, the TV One cable network and ''The Bernie Mac Show'' on Fox, was created by Burrell Communications, the Chicago-based agency that does most of McDonald's advertising for black consumers.
 Rick Mariquen, director of Hispanic consumer marketing at McDonald's, says ads aimed at Hispanics in both Spanish and English often feature groups of friends or families gathering at McDonald's. ''They come to the stores in large groups, often families, and see the experience as a social one,'' said Mr. Mariquen, whose parents are from Guatemala. 
 In the last four years, McDonald's has increased its advertising spending on Spanish-language television by 60 percent, to $57.4 million a year, according to Nielsen Monitor-Plus. 
 But to people like Ms. Schneider, the nutrition adviser in Fresno County, all those ads only make her job more challenging. Through a federally funded program run with the University of California, Davis, she offers free nutrition education classes in heavily Latino communities. Many of the classes, she says, are attended by people who are overweight with a host of health problems. 
 Ms. Schneider says she does not think it is realistic to instruct people to stop going to fast-food restaurants. But she says the program encourages students to go less frequently or make different menu choices. 
 ''Restaurant advertising looks very fun and social,'' Ms. Schneider said. ''But fast-food ads don't show you what happens when you're in your 40's and your cholesterol's high and your heart has to work really hard to pump.''

HEADLINE: China's Rising Need for Oil Is High on U.S. Agenda

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 18 

 BODY:
The competition for access to oil is emerging high on the agenda for President Hu Jintao's visit to the White House this week. President Bush has called China's growing demand for oil one reason for rising prices, and has warned Beijing against trying to ''lock up'' global supplies.
 With crude oil selling for more than $70 a barrel and American motorists paying $3 a gallon for gasoline, American officials say the subject cannot be avoided at Thursday's meeting in the Oval Office, as it was sidestepped when Mr. Bush visited Beijing last fall.
China's appetite for oil also affects its stance on Iran, where a growing confrontation with the United States over nuclear programs has already unsettled oil markets. China has invested heavily in Iran, and as a permanent member of the Security Council, its position on the question of sanctions is crucial. 
 Even as Mr. Hu arrived in Seattle on Tuesday, Chinese and American negotiators were debating a proposal for the two presidents to announce a joint study of both nations' energy needs as a way to ward off conflict in coming decades, when China's rapidly expanding need for imported energy to sustain its growth may collide with the needs of the United States, Europe and Japan. 
 In 2004 China used some 6.5 million barrels of oil a day and overtook Japan as the world's second largest user of petroleum products. The largest, the United States, consumes about 20 million barrels a day. 
 The administration's focus on China's quest for oil was signaled when it published a revised National Security Strategy last month, approved by Mr. Bush, that contained a pointed new entry about China. 
 That country's leaders, the document declared, are ''expanding trade, but acting as if they can somehow 'lock up' energy supplies around the world or seek to direct markets rather than opening them up, as if they can follow a mercantilism borrowed from a discredited era.''
 Mercantilism was a post-feudal doctrine of national economic health through protectionism, foreign trade and exports, but administration officials have repeatedly used it to describe China, just as they once used it in the 1980's to describe Japan's approach to global trade. 
 In the case of China, the term is increasingly employed to paint a picture of a 21st-century version of the Great Game, the 19th-century maneuvering for primacy in Central Asia, in which China's search for oil is merging with its desire for greater influence, from Africa to Latin America to the Middle East.
 ''They are buying long-term supplies wherever they find them, including in unsavory places like Sudan, Iran and Burma, where we won't buy,'' said Michael J. Green, a Georgetown University professor who directed policy on China at the National Security Council until late last year. ''They say it is benign, because they don't interfere with the internal affairs of other nations. And we say it is anything but benign, because it finances these regimes' bad behavior.''
 The public discussion began in September, when the deputy secretary of state, Robert B. Zoellick, urged China to become a ''responsible stakeholder'' on the world stage. He suggested that China should rethink a policy of buying oil from the Burmese or the Sudanese simply because it could. ''China's involvement with troublesome states indicates at best a blindness to consequences, and at worst something more ominous,'' Mr. Zoellick said at the time.
 Nonetheless, Chinese officials said they liked much of his commentary because it suggested an equality between China as a rising power and the United States as an established one. So far, however, the officials have not responded to the administration's call to rethink their policy.
 In an interview on Tuesday, Mr. Zoellick said that he did not mean to suggest that China was deliberately trying to funnel oil from world markets, but rather that its vast energy bureaucracy was racing along that path in response to commands to keep the economy growing. 
 During the visit of Mr. Hu, he said, ''we are seeking to steer them from a narrow perspective to a recognition that together we need to expand sources of supply, including non-oil and gas, and increase efficiency.''
 The issue is likely to come to a particular head over Iran. Sinopec, China's state-owned oil giant, signed a $70 billion deal with the Iranians in November 2004 to develop the Yadavaran oil field. The United States Department of Energy believes the field could ''eventually produce 300,000 barrels a day.'' 
 China's interest in keeping that investment healthy, officials say, is one reason it has refused to support sanctions against Iran for defying the Security Council over the country's enrichment of uranium. 
 A senior administration official, briefing reporters at the White House on Monday on the condition that he not be identified, said, ''I think the Chinese have come around to a point of realizing that we need to stand firm on the issue of the Iranian nuclear program.'' 
 But two other officials expressed doubts, saying China's sensitivity about its own oil supplies was one reason President Bush had rejected any sanctions against Iran that would be aimed at its oil sector. ''Getting the Chinese to come around on Iran,'' said one of the officials, who has been preparing for the meeting of the two leaders, ''is going to be the great test of whether we're getting through on these issues.''
 Outside experts warn that the competition can be overblown. 
 ''I sense that there is a diversity of views on this among the Chinese I speak to, and there are some who are questioning this mercantilist policy,'' said Elizabeth C. Economy, of the Council on Foreign Relations, and the author of ''The River Runs Black,'' a study of the environmental impact of China's growth. 
 ''If China has a prayer of continuing to grow at this rate, they have to move to far more efficient ways of using energy,'' she said, making a point that President Bush has made repeatedly in recent weeks. 
 Bates Gill, a China scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies here, warned recently that the United States had ''thus far tended to over-exaggerate this issue of energy in our ever desperate search to find yet another major competitor with which to pick a fight.''
 With huge coal reserves, China imports only about 12 percent of its energy, Mr. Gill noted. It is rapidly expanding its use of nuclear power, though most experts believe it cannot meet its goals for the construction of new plants. 
 Mr. Bush's aides counter, however, that the growth in the Chinese automobile market is causing a surge in oil imports; the Energy Department estimates that China's demand will more than double, to 14.2 million barrels a day, by 2025. More than two-thirds of that will be imported, the department estimated last year. The United States currently imports about 60 percent of its daily 20 million barrels. Such figures led the White House to order a study last year of the potential political effects of that rise in demand. 
 Mr. Green, who left the National Security Council in December, recalled a visit from a senior Chinese official who tried to explain that China was only seeking business deals, and was not trying to influence countries where it was doing business.
 ''He used the example of Sudan and he said, 'Look, you know, we don't care about internal issues like genocide, we only care about the oil because we need the resources.' '' 
 ''And I said, 'Well look, that's mercantilism.' And the Chinese translator had trouble translating ''mercantilism'' and they had a big debate about it, and we figured it out. And then they had a big debate about whether I meant that as a good thing or a bad thing.''

HEADLINE: Benefits Threatened, Auto Workers Line Up for Elective Procedures

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM; Jeremy W. Peters contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
The auto industry's efforts to rein in employee health costs is drawing an expensive reaction, as union workers and their spouses hurry to Michigan doctors for knee replacements and other elective procedures before they lose their comprehensive medical benefits. 
 Hospitals, doctors and insurers have all noticed a surge in demand for elective surgery since last year when Rick Wagoner, the chief executive of General Motors, led a public relations campaign to prepare auto workers for health care cutbacks, and Delphi, the G.M. parts supplier, filed for bankruptcy protection. Hip, knee and shoulder replacements at the Henry Ford Health System were ''up 20 percent in the second half of last year and remain strong,'' said Robert Riney, chief operating officer of the system, the largest hospital group in the Detroit area. 
''In the last six months, we've noticed a significant increase in people seeking elective surgical procedures in anticipation that they might be losing their health benefits,'' Mr. Riney said. He would not say how much his health system was billing the auto industry because of the last-minute rush to have elective procedures performed. 
 Among smaller medical systems, the William Beaumont Hospital in suburban Royal Oak, Mich., said it had had several hundred more surgical operations of all types since Jan. 1, compared with the same period in 2005.
 Mickolynn Schacher is among those determined to take advantage of generous health benefits while she can. Fearing that her husband, Ronald, an electrician at Delphi, may soon lose his health coverage, Mrs. Schacher, 56, is rushing to have artificial knees implanted while he still has full benefits under his United Automobile Workers union contract. 
 ''I had my right knee replaced Jan. 31 and scheduled my left knee for June 12,'' Ms. Schacher said. ''I'm trying to get them both in before my husband retires or whatever happens.'' The combined cost, at McLaren Regional Medical Center in Flint, Mich., will be about $28,000. 
 Her husband's company is seeking approval for drastic cuts in wages and benefits, in a three-way negotiation with the auto workers' union, General Motors and a bankruptcy judge. 
 Meanwhile, under an agreement with the union in December, G.M. and Ford retirees will start paying monthly health care premiums, annual deductibles and co-payments for some services. Whether current workers take buyout packages and in many cases voluntarily give up health benefits, or hang on and risk eventually losing jobs and benefits anyway, there are no guarantees. 
 ''It's like a roulette wheel you bet on in Las Vegas,'' said Uwe E. Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton University. ''It's an agonizing decision.''
 General Motors is offering $140,000 to hourly employees with 10 years of service who agree to drop their health care benefits. Ford has offered $100,000 in a similar deal to workers in several of its plants. Analysts said that, depending on the worker's age, the General Motors offer might cover only about half of future health care costs for typical workers, assuming they did not find another job with at least some medical coverage.
 Company and union officials have been holding meetings at 85 G.M. plants. Richard Shoemaker, a U.A.W. vice president, said workers were being told, ''If you don't have a spouse that has health insurance or is covered some other way, you need to think long and hard about taking the buyout.''
 He added, ''You can go through $140,000 with amazing quickness.'' 
 Thus the rush to get expensive elective procedures completed while someone else is picking up most of the bill. 
 Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, which insures 4.7 million people, including thousands of auto workers, pays from $13,000 to $15,000 for knee or hip surgery to hospitals, on average, and typically $1,800 to $3,300 to doctors, said Helen Stojic, a Michigan Blue Cross spokeswoman. Hospitals typically receive $10,000 for shoulder surgery, while doctors' fees average $1,400.
 Ms. Schacher's surgeon, Dr. Sidney N. Martin at Family Orthopedics in Flint, has seen a steady stream of patients with problems in his specialties: shoulders and knees. ''We live in an area that is heavily penetrated with the sort of cradle-to-grave kind of health care that G.M. used to give people,'' he said ''The concern they have is 'What's going to happen to me down the road?' '' 
 Mrs. Schacher's husband has been at Delphi for 31 years, 24 of those at General Motors before G.M. spun off Delphi as a separate company in 1999. ''We're hoping that if he retires he will still have some insurance,'' she said. ''It's more than likely we will pay much more than now.''


CORRECTION-DATE: April 22, 2006

 CORRECTION:
A chart in Business Day on Wednesday with an article about the auto industry's efforts to rein in health care costs misstated the severance alternatives for some workers at General Motors. (The error also appeared in a chart on March 23.) Hourly workers nearing retirement who leave immediately will receive up to $2,900 a month until they reach their 30th anniversary of service. They must retire at that point and will receive a full pension. They cannot work in the interim, and the money is not in addition to their regular pay.

HEADLINE: Chinese Leader Focuses on Business as 4-Day U.S. Visit Begins in Washington State 

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: SEATTLE, April 18 

 BODY:
The Chinese president, Hu Jintao, began courting major American business leaders on Tuesday, kicking off a four-day United States tour intended to soothe qualms about China's surging trade surplus and rising political power.
 Mr. Hu, who on Thursday will make his first visit to the White House since becoming China's top leader more than three years ago, landed in Everett, Wash., north of Seattle, and plunged into meetings with local officials and business executives, including Gov. Chris Gregoire and the Starbucks chairman, Howard D. Schultz.
He later visited the headquarters of the software giant Microsoft in Redmond, and his evening plans included dining with local dignitaries at the Medina mansion of Bill Gates, the company's chairman. On Wednesday, Boeing will be his host at its aircraft factory in Everett. 
 At Microsoft headquarters, Mr. Hu lavishly praised the company. Microsoft has struggled to find a firm foothold in China, which is widely accused of pirating software on an industrial scale, but has recently signed deals with Chinese companies that could lead to a sharp increase in sales of its Windows operating system. 
 ''I admire what you have achieved at Microsoft,'' Hu told Mr. Gates in front of reporters. ''You, Mr. Bill Gates, are a friend of China, and I'm a friend of Microsoft.'' 
 He added, ''I am dealing with the operating system produced by Microsoft every day.''
 The business focus follows a tradition set by Deng Xiaoping on his first visit to the United States in 1979, when he communed with American capitalists just as China began to shed its Maoist legacy and open up to the outside world. 
 Beijing has since treated close ties to American business leaders as vital to its overall relations with Washington, because the two countries are much more integrated economically than politically, diplomatically or culturally. 
 Still, direct dealings with corporate leaders is a novelty for Mr. Hu, who, unlike his predecessors, almost never meets foreign business leaders in Beijing and remains aloof from the commercial dealings of the Chinese government.
 Mr. Hu, 63, has made multiple trips to Europe, Russia, East Asian neighbors, and even Latin American and African countries, since assuming China's top political posts, head of the Communist Party and president, in 2002 and 2003. At least initially he put less emphasis on forging tighter links to the United States, which he has criticized in domestic speeches as a potential threat to China's ruling Communist Party.
 But Chinese officials and analysts say he has since made clear that internal priorities -- maintaining rapid economic growth and tamping down a wave of unrest over corruption, governmental land grabs, and severe pollution -- are better served if Beijing cultivates cordial relations with Washington.
 He is also eager to head off a backlash in Congress over China's record $203 billion trade surplus with the United States last year. Two proposals in Congress call for imposing sanctions against China unless it allows its tightly controlled currency to rise against the dollar, reducing the cost advantage of Chinese exports in the American market.
 At home, Mr. Hu also hopes a high-profile mission to the United States, with the pomp of a 21-gun salute on the South Lawn of the White House and an elaborate reception at the home of Mr. Gates, the world's richest man, will shore up his standing both within the Communist Party hierarchy and in the eyes of the general public in China.
 ''His relative status in the leadership is strengthened when he focuses on foreign policy, where he is clearly the No. 1,'' said David Bachman, a China specialist at the University of Washington.
 Mr. Hu arrived amid intensive security on Tuesday morning, with access to his downtown luxury hotel blocked on all sides.
 Several hundred local residents lined the streets along his hotel. They were divided between members of Chinese patriotic groups, many carrying paired Chinese and American flags, and anti-Beijing protesters, especially members of the Falun Gong movement, which is outlawed in China, and supporters of Taiwanese independence. Falun Gong supporters used sound trucks to blast messages into Mr. Hu's hotel, accusing China's internal security forces of torture, organ harvesting and other atrocities. They also appeared near Microsoft's headquarters.
 Mr. Hu's visit, brokered in part by Gary Locke, a Chinese-American lawyer and Washington's former governor, came as a boon for Seattle's leading corporations. Even local farmers got a plug for their produce, as beef with Walla Walla onions, Granny Smith apples and local asparagus were on the menu for the gathering at Mr. Gates's home.
 Boeing, which will show Mr. Hu a production line and allow him to operate a flight simulator, earlier signed an agreement to sell 80 of its single-aisle 737 aircraft to China in a purchase valued at $4.6 billion.
 Microsoft, which gave Mr. Hu a tour of a hyper-technological home of the future, was reaping the rewards of a new regulation requiring all Chinese-made computers to preinstall a copyrighted operating system to prevent piracy.
 In the past two weeks, Microsoft has signed four agreements with Chinese computer manufacturers to preinstall Windows. The largest came Monday, when the Lenovo Group said it would spend $1.2 billion over the next year on Windows.
 Craig J. Mundie, Microsoft's chief technical officer, said he hoped the visit by Mr. Hu signaled that China now views protection of intellectual property, including software, as vital to its own development.
 ''I think Chinese leaders have now made that conceptual leap -- that they need this if they are going to make the transition to a knowledge economy from a manufacturing economy,'' Mr. Mundie said. ''It is also true that Microsoft will be a natural beneficiary.''

HEADLINE: Prices Paid To Producers Gain Slightly

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 18 

 BODY:
Producer prices outside the volatile food and energy categories posted their smallest gain in four months in March, and housing starts tumbled, the Labor Department said Tuesday. 
 The agency said its overall price index, a gauge of prices received by farms, factories and refineries, climbed 0.5 percent last month as energy prices resumed an upward march. But so-called core prices, which exclude food and energy, rose just 0.1 percent. 
The Commerce Department reported that groundbreaking for new homes fell 7.8 percent, to a pace of 1.96 million units, from an upwardly revised rate of 2.126 million units in February.
 Prices for government bonds rose and the dollar fell as traders saw the data as bolstering the case for the Federal Reserve to move to the sidelines after what is likely to be a final rate increase at the coming May meeting of its policy-making committee.
 ''It suggests the Fed will do less rather than more,'' said David Sloan, an economist at 4Cast in New York.
 Some analysts, however, said the news on tame inflation could be overshadowed by a renewed run-up in oil costs, which hit a record $72.64 a barrel in London on Tuesday on concern that a showdown over Iran's nuclear program could disrupt supplies.
 The Labor Department said energy prices, which had fallen 4.7 percent in February, climbed 1.8 percent in March. Food prices increased 0.5 percent after a 2.7 percent drop in February.
 The rise in energy prices reflected a 9.1 percent increase in the cost of gasoline, the biggest since November 2004. Natural gas costs fell 0.5 percent, residential electricity prices slid 0.7 percent and home heating oil dropped 3.6 percent.
 Over the past year, producer prices have risen 3.5 percent, largely because of surging energy costs. But excluding food and energy, they are up just 1.7 percent.
 A fading of last year's energy price pressures had pulled producer prices down at a 2.5 percent annual rate in the first three months of this year, but the renewed surge in oil costs could make that inflation relief temporary.
 Central bank officials will keep a close eye on inflation data due out this week after expressing concern that lofty prices for energy could heighten inflation. The Labor Department is scheduled to release its closely watched consumer price index for March on Wednesday.
 The latest signs of cooling in the housing market, however, suggest that a slower pace of economic growth ahead may help keep inflation pressures tamped down.
 The drop in the pace of housing construction in March was sharper than economists had expected. The report showed that more sluggish single-family home construction easily offset strength in the pace of groundbreaking on multifamily units.
 New construction of single-family homes fell 12 percent, to a pace of 1.591 million units, after dropping 2.3 percent in February, to a rate of 1.807 million units. Multifamily starts rose 15.7 percent, to a pace of 369,000 units, after tumbling a revised 30.3 percent in February.
 Permits for future groundbreaking, an indicator of builder confidence, dropped 5.5 percent in March, to a pace of 2.059 million units, from 2.179 million in February.

HEADLINE: Shares Soar as Hopes for Rate Relief Outweigh Oil Prices 

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks staged their biggest rally in a year after the latest Federal Reserve minutes encouraged speculation that the 21-month-old policy of higher interest rates might be coming to an end.
 Commodity producers including Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold and Exxon Mobil set the pace as oil and metal prices reached records.
Minutes from a Fed policy meeting showed that the central bank might soon stop raising rates after doing so 15 times since June 2004. The release of the minutes extended a rally that started after a government report showed prices paid to producers, excluding food and energy, rose less than forecast in March. 
 ''Moderate growth and moderate inflation is what the Fed is telling the market it is seeing,'' said Joseph Quinlan, chief market strategist at Bank of America Capital Management in New York. ''That's a bullish scenario for stocks.''
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 22.32 points, or 1.74 percent, to 1,307.65 and the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 194.99 points, or 1.76 percent, to 11,268.77. The Nasdaq composite index increased 44.98 points, or 1.95 percent, to 2,356.14. All three indexes had their biggest increase since April 21 of last year.
 The Russell 2000 index, a benchmark for smaller companies, rose 2.7 percent, to 769.81, its best gain since December 2003.
 Energy stocks rallied as crude oil touched a record of $71.60 a barrel in New York. Metal producers surged as copper had the largest one-day advance since 1996 and Freeport-McMoRan reported that first-quarter profit soared. More than seven stocks rose for every one that fell on the New York Stock Exchange, the broadest rally since May 2004. 
 ''Most members thought that the end of the tightening process was likely to be near, and some expressed concerns about the dangers of tightening too much given the lags in the effects of policy,'' according to the minutes of the meeting, which was Ben S. Bernanke's first as Fed chairman. ''Members also recognized that in current circumstances checking the upside risks to inflation was important.''
 Janet Yellen, head of the Fed's San Francisco bank, added to the enthusiasm after saying in a speech in San Jose, Calif., that she is ''highly alert'' to the chance the central bank will raise interest rates by too much. 
 The Goldman Sachs commodity index rose to a record as concern over Iran's nuclear program sent the price of oil surging and speculation about higher demand in China stoked buying of metals. 
 Gold for June delivery reached $623.30 an ounce in New York, the highest since December 1980. Copper for delivery in three months rose as much as 5.9 percent, to a record $6,500.30.
 Freeport-McMoRan shares jumped $4.38, or 6.7 percent, to $69.57. Profit after payment of preferred dividends climbed to $1.23 a share, while sales rose 35 percent to $1.09 billion. Analysts, on average, expected 88 cents and $927.4 million, respectively, according to Thomson.
 Concern that a dispute over Iran's nuclear program may lead to a military conflict and disrupt supplies lifted oil and natural gas shares. An index of energy shares rallied 2.5 percent. Exxon Mobil rose $1.49, to $63.54. 
 Interest rates were lower, with the 10-year Treasury bill slipping to 4.98 percent from 5 percent late Monday and the price, which moves in the opposite direction from the yield, rising 5/32, to 96 9/32.
 Following are the results of yesterday's auction of four-week Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: New York Building Workers Rally Against a Wage Freeze

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE; Sarah Garland contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
The chief negotiator for New York City's real estate industry said yesterday that the two sides remained far apart as the union representing 28,000 apartment-building workers continued to threaten a strike for Friday. 
 The industry's negotiator, James F. Berg, called on doormen, elevator operators and other workers to accept a one-year wage freeze. But at a boisterous rally in Central Park, many union members said they would rather strike.
Mr. Berg, the president of the Realty Advisory Board on Labor Relations, which represents owners of rental buildings, condominiums and cooperatives, said a wage freeze was warranted because the industry had already pumped $175 million into rescuing the union's health fund. He said that buildings were under financial strain because of higher taxes, fuel prices and health costs.
 ''The cost of operating apartment buildings has skyrocketed,'' he said at a news conference. He said the apartment-building workers should agree to what 25,000 office-tower workers who belong to the same union agreed to 18 months ago: a wage freeze in exchange for an industry bailout of their health fund.
 But at the rally, sponsored by Local 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union, the workers were in no mood to accept a wage freeze. Several police officials estimated that more than 5,000 demonstrators attended the rally, which filled the 79th Street Transverse from Fifth Avenue to Central Park West. The road was closed to traffic.
 ''I don't want to go on strike, but if we don't get a raise, we will have to,'' said William Courtney, a doorman at 955 Fifth Avenue. ''We live in the richest city in the world. How can they justify that?''
 Jose Gonzales, a doorman at 455 Central Park West, said: ''I'm not worried about striking. I'm just worried about winning.''
 The two sides held repeated negotiating sessions yesterday at the Sheraton New York Hotel and Towers as part of what officials predicted would be feverish talks before the Friday deadline. The negotiators reported minor progress on noneconomic issues but no progress on the three main economic issues: wages, health insurance and pensions.
 The industry wants workers to pay 15 percent of their health insurance premiums, which total $9,700 a year. The union has rejected that proposal.
 Mr. Berg said many of the 3,500 buildings that faced a strike had prepared for a walkout by hiring security guards to replace doormen and by making arrangements for garbage.
 Michael Fishman, the union president, criticized the proposals. ''We want a decent life,'' he said. ''We're not going to take a step back.''

SECTION: Section D; Column 1; Sports Desk; PRO BASKETBALL -- NENAD KRSTIC : THE PROTEGE; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 898 words

HEADLINE: Nets' Spare Piece Becomes Part of Nucleus

BYLINE: By JOHN ELIGON

 BODY:
Those who know him well seem to agree on what has allowed Nenad Krstic to succeed in the N.B.A.: hard work. He is known for being the first player to arrive at Nets practice and the last to leave. It has been said that his coaches have had to pry Krstic off the court.
 He developed that work ethic while growing up in a time of war in Serbia, where his parents slept in the living room so that Krstic and his sister could have the comfort of the apartment's only bedroom. 
That upbringing most likely contributed to Krstic's quiet humility. He plays down how much he has meant to the Nets in recent weeks. Although their 14-game winning streak is over, the improvements the 7-foot Krstic made on both sides of the ball during that stretch have not been forgotten.
 Through March 6, Krstic averaged 12.6 points, 5.7 rebounds and 0.7 blocked shots. From March 7 through April 9, as the Nets won 15 of 17 games, Krstic averaged 16.1 points, 8.6 rebounds and 1.1 blocks. It was a coming-out party of sorts.
 Krstic, 22, has become the Nets' big fourth.
 That notion was made clear in a new billboard near Continental Arena, the team's home in East Rutherford, N.J. It features an image of Krstic alongside his teammates Jason Kidd, Vince Carter and Richard Jefferson, who are referred to as the big three.
 The ad is perhaps indicative of the Nets' hope that Krstic will give them the inside presence they need to contend in the Eastern Conference for seasons to come.
 ''I think in the next couple years he can be an All-Star-caliber player,'' Chicago Bulls Coach Scott Skiles said before a recent game against the Nets. ''He's got great moves, hands, nice touch.''
 Krstic was born in Kraljevo, then part of Yugoslavia, and was 8 when war broke out. Though he did not live in the line of fire, Krstic said, Serbia was stricken financially.
 He said that his father, who worked in construction, and his mother, who was a nurse, each earned about $10 a month in the mid-1990's. They always had food, he said, but the portions were small.
 Those struggles seem to have helped Krstic mature much faster than some might have expected.
 Krstic ''grew up in a very tough environment -- the economy and the war,'' said Vlade Divac, the most popular player to come out of Serbia, who retired last year after 16 seasons in the N.B.A.
 ''When I grew up, it was nice; it was a beautiful country,'' Divac, who is an international scout for the Los Angeles Lakers, said in a telephone interview. ''I didn't have those problems,'' Many have compared Krstic to Divac because they took the same path to the N.B.A. Like Divac, Krstic moved to Belgrade as a teenager to play for Partizan, Serbia's top club. Krstic is becoming a recognizable face in his home country, and Divac is one of the most popular players ever in Europe.
 Krstic was a lanky 11-year-old when he started playing basketball and joined the club in his hometown. He did not have much money, so he wore a cheap pair of Converse sneakers.
 Basketball kept Krstic out of trouble, and his parents made sure he did things the right way.
 ''They teach me how to respect other people,'' Krstic said. ''If you respect other people, you respect yourself.''
 He competed on Serbia's highest professional level from the time he was 17.
 ''I saw that with Krstic, that these older centers would try to manhandle him,'' Nets General Manager Ed Stefanski said of the first time he saw Krstic playing in a tournament with the club Partizan. ''And they were physically stronger and they could push him around, but he just kept coming back for more.''
 Krstic spent four seasons in Belgrade with Partizan before joining the Nets for the 2004-5 season, two years after they selected him with the 24th pick in the draft. Krstic did not come straight to the N.B.A. on the advice of Divac, a former president of Partizan. Spending those two seasons in Europe helped Krstic sharpen his skills and learn basketball tactics, said Aleksandar Dzikic, a former assistant coach with Partizan.
 ''I think that time he spent with us helped him to become a better team player,'' Dzikic, now an assistant with the Minnesota Timberwolves, said by telephone. ''He was a quick learner, very quiet, very coachable.''
 With the Nets, Krstic has had the benefit of working with the assistant coach Bill Cartwright, who had a 15-year N.B.A. career.
 Under the tutelage of the 7-1 Cartwright, Krstic has gained floor awareness. On offense, he is learning how to go up against bulkier players and to dominate smaller ones. 
 But Krstic's biggest asset on offense may be his confidence. He is a threat from the outside and has shown no fear in attacking the basket.
 Despite his improved statistics, Krstic remains a liability on defense because, at 240 pounds, he does not have the bulk to hold his ground. Jason Collins, who is 7 feet and 255 pounds, is usually charged with defending the opposing team's best interior player. 
 To make up for his lack of size, Krstic relies on good positioning to provide help on defense and grab rebounds. But the Nets are hopeful that with more conditioning, Krstic will become a formidable defender.
 Divac said he was optimistic that Krstic would grow into a dominant player.
 ''Nenad is much stronger,'' Divac said. ''He works hard. He doesn't make a lot of mistakes. I would say he has a chance to be an even better N.B.A. player than I was.''

HEADLINE: 2 Banks Post Record First-Quarter Profits

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Two banks, Wells Fargo & Company and U.S. Bancorp, posted record first-quarter profits yesterday, shrugging off a recent home mortgage slowdown caused by rising interest rates. 
 Profit at Wells Fargo, which is based in San Francisco, rose 9 percent to $2.02 billion -- the first time in the company's 154-year old history it passed the $2 billion mark. U.S. Bancorp posted a 7.7 percent increase in profit to $1.15 billion.
For both banks, diversification was crucial to the higher returns. Both leaned on acquisitions and an expansion of their retail branch network to increase lending revenue despite the cooling of the mortgage market.
 ''We had solid, broad-based and, in many businesses, accelerating revenue growth, with revenue in businesses other than home mortgage up a combined 17 percent from a year ago,'' the chief financial officer of Wells Fargo, Howard Atkins, said in a statement. Wells Fargo reported that earnings rose to $1.19 a share from $1.08 in the year-ago period.
 Revenue totaled $8.56 billion, a 6 percent increase from $8.09 billion a year ago.
 The company's home mortgage division posted revenue of $853 million, a 44 percent drop from $1.52 billion last year.
 Accounting adjustments to Wells Fargo's home mortgage servicing portfolio contributed to the erosion.
 Profit at U.S. Bancorp climbed to 63 cents a share, from 57 cents, or a total of $1.07 billion, a year earlier.

HEADLINE: A City Hall Feeling Its Way In a Renewed Battle on Poverty

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL; Sewell Chan contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
After four years of near silence on the issue, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg declared his own war on poverty during his re-election campaign. Soon after his victory, he pledged in his State of the City address to help the poor, and even convened a high-profile commission to strategize on how to fulfill that promise.
 But when his aides moved recently to ease rules for obtaining food stamps for a small but significant population, he blocked them, leaving advocates for the poor and elected officials mystified. 
Mr. Bloomberg said yesterday that his decision not to seek a federal waiver that would have allowed some able-bodied adults ages 18 to 49 to receive food stamps for longer periods of time was simply part of a fair-minded refusal to reward people who were able to work but not employed.
 ''I'm a believer that people should have to work for a living,'' Mr. Bloomberg told reporters at a Queens hospital. ''You have to have a penalty if there's a requirement to work, and this penalty is one that's appropriate,'' he added. ''The city has a whole host of programs to make sure that nobody goes without food.''
 But some outsiders say they see something else at work in the decision: a deep ambivalence toward anything that carries even the faintest whiff of welfare, a program that Mr. Bloomberg's predecessor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, famously moved to restrict.
 ''Everything has existed in the shadow of the Giuliani approach,'' said Bill de Blasio, chairman of the City Council's General Welfare Committee. ''Early on it was clear that Bloomberg wasn't trying to be Giuliani or even Giuliani Lite,'' he continued, adding that the administration had actively pursued certain programs to help the poor. ''But the closer it gets to public assistance, the more there seems to be a fear of seeming permissive.''
 Indeed, even though Mr. Bloomberg holds some socially liberal ideals dear -- he favors gay marriage, supports abortion rights and is pro-gun control -- he has seemed far less comfortable championing the immediate needs of the poor, preferring to focus on longer-term goals like economic development, affordable housing and education reform.
 In the 2005 mayoral race, for instance, he did not talk aggressively about the city's poverty rate, which has been climbing, until after Fernando Ferrer, his Democratic rival, made it a campaign issue.
 ''The Giuliani administration was hostile towards public benefits programs, and this administration has been ambivalent all along,'' said Joel S. Berg, executive director of the New York City Coalition Against Hunger, which represents 1,100 food pantries and soup kitchens, adding that in Mr. Bloomberg's major speech on welfare reform in his first term, ''there wasn't a peep about food stamps.''
 ''It's been a really significant omission all of these years that they haven't seen food stamps as work support,'' Mr. Berg continued, meaning a public support that helps people to secure and keep jobs. 
 Both Mr. Bloomberg and his human resources commissioner, Verna Eggleston, have been opposed to seeking the waiver in the past, apparently out of a sense that to receive a public benefit like food stamps, people who can work should. But as the city has continued to move people off the welfare rolls, social service officials appear to have shifted their thinking about who is truly capable of working.
 ''Some people have barriers that make it impossible, or very difficult, for them to find jobs,'' Robert McHugh, a spokesman for the city's Human Resources Administration, said earlier this week.
 But the shift among city officials toward easing eligibility for food stamps -- a change endorsed by Commissioner Eggleston -- has not yet been embraced in the highest reaches of city government.
 Mr. Bloomberg's chief spokesman, Stu Loeser, said the gap over the issue grew out of both the mayor's governing style and substance. Given that Mr. Bloomberg thinks that a frequent fault of government is to avoid trying new things out of a fear of failing, Mr. Loeser said, ''it's not surprising that we have people within the administration who are exploring different ways of doing things -- it's what we want.'' 
 At the same time, he continued, Mr. Bloomberg is the one who is accountable to voters and who has to make choices about how to focus the city's resources. ''Are we changing our policy, or do we still have more to do in terms of reaching out to people who are currently qualified for food stamps?'' Mr. Loeser asked rhetorically. ''The mayor's decision is to focus on that.'' 
 This internal debate is playing out even as the Bloomberg administration pursues its own agenda of increasing the number of eligible people receiving food stamps by making it easier to apply. 
 Meanwhile, City Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn plans to make that issue a prominent part of the City Hall budget negotiations, and she outlined her initiatives yesterday. Elected officials like Representative Anthony D. Weiner are making noise about hunger on the way to a likely 2009 mayoral campaign, and advocates for the poor are paying close attention to the shifting thinking within the administration. 
 ''The fact that Bloomberg is focusing on poverty and the fact that we are even having this discussion,'' Mr. Berg said, ''means that people in the administration are talking about this very seriously.'' Despite the problems he sees with the administration's approach, he said, ''there are a lot of really positive signs.''

HEADLINE: The Greening of a Landmark of Urban Blight

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

 BODY:
In the South Bronx, vacant lots achieve a kind of fame, if not infamy.
 President Jimmy Carter's visit in October 1977 to an abandoned lot at Charlotte Street and Boston Road transformed an anonymous stretch of New York City into a national symbol of urban blight.
A couple of blocks away, a small patch of land became notorious as both Hollywood backdrop and neighborhood dumping ground. The five-story buildings that sat on the triangular lot at Louis Nine Boulevard and Intervale Avenue were torn down around 1980. The remaining mound of debris was used to set the mood for a bleak scene -- the one where a prostitute kills two police officers -- in the 1981 movie ''Fort Apache, the Bronx.'' The lot has been vacant ever since, home to burned-out cars, trash, broken television sets and blackened soil from a 40-square-foot diesel spill. 
 It is here, of all places, that Nancy Biberman is planning to build big -- and green. The empty lot will be the site of a $45 million, 174-unit housing complex for low-income families. A groundbreaking ceremony is to take place today.
 Amid the concrete and grit of a neighborhood near the rattling elevated trains on Southern Boulevard, the red brick building will be surrounded and shaded by nearly 100 trees. By using high-efficiency boilers, it will use 85 percent less natural gas to generate heat and hot water than typical low-cost housing in the city, according to a project consultant. The paints, glues and other materials used in construction will be low in the pollutants known as volatile organic compounds. Four to 18 inches of soil will cover most of the roof, part of a green roof system of shrubs and small trees to reduce air pollution and absorb storm water runoff.
 Ms. Biberman is president of the Bronx nonprofit group building the complex, the Women's Housing and Economic Development Corporation, known as Whedco, which is hoping to create an intricately designed, energy-efficient home for families earning $28,000 to $39,000 a year, with one-bedroom apartments renting for $660 a month. The building will offer a touch of elegance and sophistication -- each unit will have a computer and be wired for high-speed Internet access -- in one of the nation's poorest Congressional districts.
 On Monday afternoon, Ms. Biberman took a walk around the lot, once owned by the city, to see the transformation firsthand. For now, it remains a rocky, weed-covered area. But workers have been digging out what remained of the demolished buildings left to rot for more than two decades. The oil spill at the front of the nearly one-acre lot was cleaned up, but at the back of the site, a machine was busy scooping up contaminated soil and dumping it onto trucks for removal.
 Debris that was buried in the ground or dumped on the surface was scattered. There were clumps of bathroom tile, a rusty oil tank, a flattened Rheingold can. The machine clawed the earth along Louis Nine Boulevard, working in the same spot where the scene in ''Fort Apache, the Bronx'' was filmed.
 ''This lot has been vacant and rubble-strewn, and just a reminder of bad times,'' Ms. Biberman said. The new building, she added, is ''symbolic in a way of the rebuilding of the Bronx.''
 Whedco plans to start renting out the building, which will also include commercial storefront space, in the fall of 2007. It will be one of the few low-cost housing developments in New York to have a major environmentally friendly focus, and it will be built with a combination of city, state, federal and private funds in a section of the city where asthma and air pollution have long been a problem.
 There will be a sculpture garden designed by the Bronx Museum of the Arts, interior motion-sensor lights and 42 trees planted in sidewalk plots about four times bigger than most such pits, to give the roots more oxygen and water.
 Ms. Biberman said the choice to build green was about more than the environment. The building's tenants, she said, ''do not have the money to take a break from city life and be in a place that's green and quiet and beautiful. If people can't afford to go there, then we're going to bring it to them.''

HEADLINE: Facing the Threat of a Nuclear Iran

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''New Worry Rises on Iranian Claim of Nuclear Steps'' (front page, April 17): 
 By invading Iraq, ignoring North Korea and continuing to arm Israel, the Bush administration has done everything possible to encourage Iran to go after a nuclear deterrent.
As for the argument that nuclear energy is a wasteful use of resources for an oil producer like Iran: before the 1979 overthrow of the shah, the American administration argued the opposite, that nuclear power would both provide for the growing needs of Iran's economy and free remaining oil reserves for export or conversion to petrochemicals.

LENGTH: 1277 words

HEADLINE: A Struggle to Keep Equipment Going 

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: HOUSTON, April 19 

 BODY:
The worldwide thirst for stuff from the ground -- materials as diverse as copper and coal, gold and oil -- has set off a stunning boom in just about every commodity market. But there is one item that lately has dealers in the global mining industry really scrambling: the supersize tire.
 Mining companies are complaining about a shortfall in the supply of the giant tires that go on large dump trucks and other heavy equipment. These outsize tires stand as tall as 12 feet tall and can spread 4 feet wide.
They are used prominently everywhere from the Canadian tar sands to open-air coal mines in the United States and China, but lately they have become almost as precious as gold and silver: prices have quadrupled for some of them in the last year to more than $40,000 a tire. 
 ''This has never happened in the 35 years I've been in this business,'' said Michael Hickman, 63, who, together with his son, owns H & H Industries in Oak Hill, Ohio, one of the nation's largest retreaders of used mining tires. 
 ''Right now the entire mining industry is going berserk, and we're feeding into it,'' said Mr. Hickman, whose company has tripled its work force to 160 in the last two years. 
 There are several reasons for the tire shortage. Demand is soaring, with greater needs by the military for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and by construction firms rebuilding the hurricane-ravaged Gulf Coast. 
 But mining companies and tire manufacturers say the biggest reason is the rapid industrialization of China, India and other developing countries, which is expanding the appetite for basic commodities. 
 The outsize tires have historically been a specialty business, so there was rarely an abundance of production capacity. Making a large tire requires a curing process in which the tire is cooled in a mold, and that can take as long as 24 hours. Factories normally produce just two to three large tires a day. 
 And with existing factories already running flat out, there is little hope for much increase in the supply of new tires anytime soon. At Michelin, the French tire company, its large-tire manufacturing plants have been ''saturated,'' according to Prashant Prabhu, its president for earthmover tires. He said all of the plants were operating at full capacity 24 hours a day, or near that level in countries where labor laws restricted flat-out production. 
 ''Our customers are very upset,'' Mr. Prabhu said. ''We cannot accommodate them at the rate they want.'' 
 Michelin, together with Goodyear of Akron, Ohio, and Bridgestone and Yokohama, both of Japan, rank among the largest manufacturers of heavy tires. 
 In many ways, the tire shortage both reflects the soaring commodities prices and contributes to it. The price of copper, which is used in electrical wiring and pipes, has climbed 45 percent this year, closing at $2.9595 a pound on Wednesday. Nickel, used to make stainless steel, is up 37 percent during the same period, while gold is up 23 percent and zinc is up 65 percent. 
 In an attempt to cash in on the commodities rally, mining companies have been reactivating old mines and expanding existing operations. But time and again, these firms have been stymied by a lack of available tires. 
 Some companies have been forced to idle their heavy equipment or alert investors of the impact of the tire shortage. For instance, Fording, one of Canada's largest coal producers, has repeatedly warned in recent months that the tire shortage could reduce its coal output. Production capacity at its mines in British Columbia and Alberta is 28 million tons a year, but output this year could fall to less than 25 million tons, company said. 
 Some newsletters in the mining and construction industries have speculated about the possibility of a black market or even outright thievery of heavy tires, but such talk appears premature. In the meantime, salvage firms are doing a thriving business in discarded tires and companies that retread tires are struggling to keep pace with demand, with used tires in some cases fetching higher prices than new tires. 
 Michelin is investing $85 million to expand its tire factory in Lexington, S.C., a move that will eventually expand production there by 50 percent. It is also building a new $550 million plant in Campo Grande, Brazil. 
 These moves and plant expansions by other tire manufacturers, however, will do little to ease the tire shortage until late 2008 or thereafter. The heavy equipment used to make the tires is relatively difficult to procure, which means that the earliest any new plants could be operating is more than two years from now.
 Tire manufacturers were largely caught off guard by the surge in demand for heavy tires, which began to heat up in 2004 after several flat years in the industry. The largest companies say they have been hesitant to increase prices by larger amounts -- despite pleas from some mining companies for tires at almost any price -- out of concern for angering long-time customers. 
 Tire companies complain they are also squeezed by rising prices for raw materials, with natural rubber prices rising nearly sixfold, to about $2 a pound since 2002, the last weak period for heavy tire sales. High crude oil and natural gas prices are also adding a burden to tire companies, which use petroleum in large amounts to produce the carbon black needed for tire carcasses and threads. 
 ''The larger the tire, the more difficult it is to source,'' said Shawn Rasey, executive sales director for off-the-road tires at Bridgestone North America. ''I don't see the shockwave of demand peaking until 2009 or 2010.'' 
 Faced with such tight tire supplies, mining companies are doing everything they can to extend the life of their tires, which typically are made to last from 4,000 to 7,000 hours. 
 Phelps Dodge, the Phoenix-based company that produces commodities like copper and molybdenum, carefully monitors its trucks and heavy equipment to achieve the optimum life for its tires. This is especially important in the Arizona heat, according to Kenneth Vaughn, a spokesman, who explained how Phelps is even using truck simulators at its mines to train drivers in ''hazard avoidance'' techniques, like gently avoiding rocks on the road.
 Some companies go even further, laying down a plastic covering, called geo-textile, on moist roads to provide a smoother ride. Newmont Mining of Denver has done that at its gold mines in Nevada, Indonesia and Peru, said Lee Krugerud, vice president of North American business affairs at Newmont. 
 Mr. Krugerud said Newmont has also been scouring other countries in an attempt to find alternate supplies of tires. Executives visited Belarus, where they found a manufacturer that still produces large, old-style ''bias-ply'' tires, which are less durable than the more popular radial tires. ''We need to have a safety option, even though those tires won't last as long,'' said Mr. Krugerud. ''The other option, parking our trucks, is not something we want to do.'' 
 Given the stress the commodities boom has unexpectedly created in an arcane area of the mining supply chain, some experts suggest that the tire shortage may keep prices higher longer than expected by limiting the ability of mining companies to meet the explosive demand for their products. But in the end, they say, there is little to worry about. 
 ''This tire issue is, I believe, more a symptom of the mining industry's strength than its weakness,'' said Tibor Rozgonyi, head of the mining engineering department at the Colorado School of Mines. ''It may be an acute concern at this moment, but the market has a way of taking care of these imbalances.''

HEADLINE: Boston Archdiocese Opens Books, Including Abuse Details

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK; Katie Zezima contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: BOSTON, April 19 

 BODY:
The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston opened its books on Wednesday, releasing what experts and church officials say is the most detailed financial accounting any diocese has made available.
 The reports show that the archdiocese has a $46 million deficit, the largest any diocese has ever had, according to two national experts on church finances.
 The archdiocese has paid out more than $150 million in legal settlements related to accusations of sexual abuse by priests. Archdiocesan officials said they planned to address the deficit in part by cutting 50 administrative positions, consolidating departments, reducing the number of cabinet secretaries and most likely selling more property and cutting programs. 
 Cardinal Sean P. O'Malley and other officials made it clear that they also hoped that the frankness of the report would inspire parishioners to increase donations, which have fallen off by several million dollars since the abuse crisis began in 2002.
 ''I think it's quite obvious that our situation is urgent, is dire,'' Cardinal O'Malley said at a news conference. ''The bleeding that's been going on with deficit spending is something that needs to be dealt with urgently.''
 Cardinal O'Malley, who will distribute pamphlets about the finances in every parish, said he hoped that as a result of the report, released a few weeks before the archdiocese's annual fund-raising drive begins, ''people will understand what our finances are and how we're using it, and hopefully will want to help us continue the mission of the church.''
 The cardinal said that a key to instilling confidence in parishioners was releasing information about the costs of the sexual abuse crisis and the sources of the money that paid for it.
 Although archdiocesan officials have repeatedly said parish collections and other donations would not be used to pay for legal settlements to abuse victims, some parishioners have remained skeptical. They have also distrusted assurances that the money generated by the closing of 62 of the 357 parishes in the archdiocese would not finance the abuse settlements.
 The new information sought to end those concerns. The reports showed that through June 30, 2005, $150.8 million was spent on the abuse crisis, including $127.4 million in legal settlements, $8.8 million in counseling and prevention programs and $8.3 million in legal and professional costs related to the settlements.
 Of that money, $68.8 million came from selling the archbishop's residence and other administrative buildings, with the rest from insurance and selling other properties not related to the closed parishes.
 ''There's been so much talk about the finances of the archdiocese and so much mystery and questions raised,'' Cardinal O'Malley said. ''We're not trying to keep secrets from people. We're not trying to deceive them. We are trying to use the limited resources that we have for the mission of the church, and we want people to be on board about that.''
 The cardinal and lay leaders of committees he appointed to examine the finances and propose improvements characterized the situation as serious, but not irrevocable. They said the cause of the problems was not the abuse settlements per se, but declining donations as a result of the abuse crisis, pension funds hurt by declining stock prices, skyrocketing health care costs for priests and the expensive maintenance for old parish buildings.
 ''We're in a difficult financial position,'' said John H. McCarthy, an accountant who led the committee that prepared the reports, which covered from July 1, 2003, to June 30, 2005. The biggest liability was $135 million in unfunded pensions for clergymen, Mr. McCarthy said.
 An investment banker who led the organization and management review committee, James F. O'Connor, said that the management of the archdiocese required a ''substantial overhaul,'' and that he hoped that the church could achieve a balanced budget in 18 months.
 Charles Zech, an economics professor at Villanova University, said that might be optimistic.
 ''Eighteen months seems to me like a relatively short time,'' Dr. Zech said. ''An operating deficit of $46 million, even for a diocese as large as Boston, that is high.''
 Francis J. Butler, president of Foundations and Donors Interested in Catholic Activities, said he believed that the deficit was the largest of any diocese. 
 ''If they restore the trust of the rank-and-file donor in their policies,'' Mr. Butler said, ''I would be optimistic that they would be able to address this.''
 Mr. Butler and Dr. Zech said they were impressed by the extent of the disclosure, which included not just the central operations, but also 43 affiliated entities like schools and Catholic Charities.
 ''They've gone way beyond the standards,'' Mr. Butler said.
 Dorothy Kennedy, president of the Boston chapter of Voice of the Faithful, a lay reform group, said, ''It's a step in the right direction.'' 
 Ms. Kennedy added that the release would probably inspire her to resume donations to the annual appeal. 
 ''I think we will have full fiscal recovery if we have full financial transparency on all levels,'' she said. ''I think it will encourage people to come back. There are many people not donating because they don't feel secure where money is going.''
 Jon Rogers of St. Francis Cabrini in Scituate, which closed in October 2004 but has been occupied by parishioners hoping to persuade the archdiocese to reopen the church, said he was very pleased with the disclosure.
 ''Americans are funny,'' Mr. Rogers said. ''You ask them to help, and they will basically crawl over each other to make sure the situation is rectified.''

HEADLINE: Immigrant Groups Plan Campaign to Bring Legal Changes

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 19 

 BODY:
Leaders of the demonstrations that drew hundreds of thousands of immigrants into the streets last week announced Wednesday that they were planning voter registration and citizenship drives across the country in an effort to transform the immigrant community into a powerful, organized political force. 
 But the leaders of immigrant advocacy groups remain sharply divided over whether immigrants should demonstrate their economic strength by staying away from their jobs, schools and local shops on May 1 in what organizers are calling the Great American Boycott of 2006. 
In Washington, the leaders of the National Capital Immigration Coalition, an alliance of immigrant, labor and business groups, is urging immigrants to ignore the boycott and to participate in voter registration drives and other activities after attending school or going to work. 
 In Los Angeles, the leaders of some immigration advocacy groups are appearing on Spanish-language radio stations and warning listeners to consider the consequences of skipping work and keeping their children out of school, particularly because dozens of immigrants were fired after participating in last week's rallies. As an alternative, organizers are planning a five-mile march that people can take part in after work. 
 Cardinal Roger Mahony of Los Angeles issued a statement opposing the boycott, saying, ''Personally, I believe that we can make May 1 a win-win day here in Southern California: go to work, go to school and then join thousands of us at a major rally afterwards.'' 
 Anjelica Salas, executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, said she and others preferred to focus on events that would win over the American public, suggesting that a national economic boycott might unnecessarily alienate ordinary people and decision makers. 
 Ms. Salas and others are proposing a national day of community service, in which immigrants, some of whom are in the country illegally, would make repairs in local schools and paint community centers to demonstrate their value to the community and commitment to the country. The date for that demonstration has not been set. 
 ''It is critical for us, that we really, as we move forward, take actions that are embraced by the American public, that touch the hearts and minds of the American public, that they get to know us, that they understand who we are,'' Ms. Salas said at a news conference here. 
 The debate over how to harness the emerging immigrant activism comes as politicians, church leaders and advocacy groups continue to marvel at the large numbers of immigrants, most of them Hispanic, who have turned out in recent weeks to demonstrate against a House bill, which was passed in December, that would criminalize illegal immigrants and those who help them. 
 Senate legislation that would have legalized most of the roughly 11 million illegal immigrants believed to be living in the United States collapsed this month amid partisan bickering over parliamentary procedure. The Senate is expected to take up immigration again when it returns from its spring recess next week. 
 Cecilia Munoz, vice president of the National Council of La Raza, said immigrants had demonstrated that they were looking for action from Congress and the White House, not partisan bickering. 
 Joshua Hoyt, executive director of the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, said that this summer would be ''an immigrant freedom summer,'' with citizenship and voter registration drives in various cities to ensure that immigrants would vote in Congressional elections this year and in the presidential election in 2008. 
 Advocates for immigrants also acknowledged that they differed with groups promoting an economic boycott, like the March 25th Coalition, the alliance of immigrant, church and business groups that organized the rally in Los Angeles in March that drew about 500,000 people.
 Oscar Sanchez, who handles public relations for the March 25th Coalition, said his group was undeterred by the concerns raised by the other advocacy groups. Mr. Sanchez said he expected the May 1 boycott to be a national success, with participation in at least 90 cities. 
 ''We don't want to hurt the United States economically,'' Mr. Sanchez said in a telephone interview from Los Angeles. ''We want to show them the buying power of the immigrant consumer. Right now, the campaign is planning a boycott and a voter registration drive on the same day, May 1. We are flexing our economic power to gain political power.''
 Gustavo Torres, executive director of CASA of Maryland, an advocacy group, countered that the timing was not right for a boycott. Mr. Torres, who is a leading proponent of the community service day, said he and others wanted to see first how the Senate responded to the calls for legalization before taking such a step. 

Immigration Crackdown
 WASHINGTON, April 19 (AP) -- Immigration agents arrested seven executives and hundreds of employees of a manufacturer of crates and pallets on Wednesday as part of a crackdown on employers of illegal immigrants.
 The authorities raided offices and plants of the company, IFCO Systems, in at least nine states, the culmination of a yearlong criminal investigation, law enforcement officials said.

HEADLINE: Not Out Of the Woods Just Yet

BYLINE: By Don Melnick and Mary Pearl. 
Don Melnick is a professor of conservation biology at Columbia University. Mary Pearl is president of Wildlife Trust.

 BODY:
OUR forests are the heart of our environmental support system. And yet, in the 36 years that have passed since the first Earth Day, on April 22, 1970, we have lost more than one billion acres of forest, with no end in sight.
 The people most vulnerable to the disappearance of forests are the poor: nearly three-quarters of the 1.2 billion people defined as extremely poor live in rural areas, where they rely most directly on forests for food, fuel, fiber and building materials. But those of us in the developed world are hardly immune. Smaller forests mean fewer predators keeping insects and rodents in check in the Northeastern United States, a phenomenon linked to the spread of Lyme disease and West Nile virus, among others. 
Everywhere, forests prevent erosion, filter and regulate the flow of fresh water, protect coral reefs and fisheries and harbor animals that pollinate, control pests and buffer disease. That is why the single most important action we can take to protect lives and livelihoods worldwide is to protect forests. And one of the best ways to do that is to change how we think about their economics.
 First, we must connect local, informal foresters, who harvest timber and other forest products for a small fraction of their value, to better markets. A good example is in Papua New Guinea. A community there receives about $13 for a cubic meter of tropical hardwood. That same cubic meter of wood, transferred through a series of intermediaries, shows up in New York Harbor with a new price tag, $700. Minimally processed into thin veneer, it sells for $2,300. That same cubic meter, fully finished, goes for over $3,000. Small forest holders who receive just pennies on the dollar for a valuable natural resource can hardly be expected to practice sustainable forestry. Opening access to regional and global markets at fair value will create strong incentives for sustainable forest management.
 Second, we must recognize the importance of forests in maintaining water and soil by encouraging their preservation along rivers. Markets can help here, as well. Costa Rica's hydroelectric power companies pay upland farmers to keep land forested to prevent the companies' dams from filling with silt. The cost is shared between a power company and its customers. Logic dictates that those who benefit when forests stop erosion should return some of those benefits to those who protect forests.
 Third, we must seek a global trade agreement that promotes legally, sustainably harvested timber. We should not tolerate the forest destruction abetted by most countries, which will neither monitor what is extracted at home, nor place conditions on imports. When we first visited Sumatra and Borneo fewer than 20 years ago, there were vast tracts of forest. Recent estimates indicate that these two islands, among the six largest in the world, could be largely clear-cut by 2012. With those trees will go people's livelihoods, communities, cultural values and health, as well as the forests' unexplored biological diversity. 
 Finally, we must protect the role that forests play in mitigating global warming by absorbing carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. Markets for trading carbon dioxide emissions credits must expand to all sources and all nations. They already exist in the developed world, where yesterday morning carbon credits from efficient factory operations and tree re-planting projects were traded at roughly 30 euros per ton. 
 If a company in Belgium can own carbon credits because it has reduced its factories' carbon emissions, then a forest owner in the Central African Republic should be able to trade the carbon credits he earns by not cutting down its trees. To the atmosphere, a ton of carbon is a ton of carbon. By opening trade in carbon credits to all countries, we provide economic opportunity to developing nations and create a very powerful incentive to conserve forests. 
 Together, these measures have the potential to reverse rates of forest loss. Sustainable forests, in turn, can form the basis for the health and economic well-being of the poorest among us, while benefiting everyone else as well. What could be a more satisfying vision for Earth Day 2006?

HEADLINE: Hamas Denies It Hid Arms Inside Jordan

BYLINE: By GREG MYRE

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, April 19 

 BODY:
Hamas on Wednesday denied accusations by Jordan that it had hidden a cache of weapons inside Jordan's borders.
 Jordan said Tuesday that it had uncovered Hamas's weapons, prompting it to postpone a visit by the Palestinian foreign minister, Mahmoud Zahar, who is also a senior Hamas leader. Hamas, which now controls the Palestinian government, said it regretted the decision to delay talks. 
A Jordanian government spokesman, Nasser Joudeh, told the Petra news agency on Tuesday that the Hamas weapons cache, found at an undisclosed site in Jordan, included rocket launchers, explosives and automatic weapons. Jordanian newspapers ran front-page photos of the arms on Wednesday.
 ''These activities contradict the positive commitment by the new Palestinian government not to use the Jordanian arena for any purposes that harm Jordan's security or for meddling in its internal affairs,'' Mr. Joudeh said Tuesday.
 Mr. Zahar planned to visit Jordan this week as part of his tour of Arab states. He is seeking money for the Palestinian Authority government, which faces a worsening financial crisis since Hamas, a radical Islamic group, assumed power last month.
 Mr. Zahar's visit would have been the most prominent one by a Hamas official since Jordan expelled several Hamas leaders in 1999. Jordan accused Hamas of secretly engaging in military training there and of working with Islamic opposition groups in Jordan.
 Sami Abu Zuhri, a Hamas spokesman, said Jordan was now using the allegations of hidden weapons ''to justify the canceling of the visit by the foreign minister.''
 Hamas has long insisted that it does not interfere with the internal affairs of Arab countries and says it fights only against Israel. However, Hamas does use neighboring countries to smuggle money and weapons into the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, according to Israel.
 Jordan, a moderate Arab state with a peace treaty with Israel and close relations with the United States, strongly backs the Palestinians as well. Much of Jordan's population is of Palestinian origin.
 However, Jordan has sought to prevent the turmoil of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from spilling into its territory and has had friction with Hamas in the past.
 In the 1999 expulsion, Jordan tossed out several top Hamas leaders, including Khaled Mashal, who is now the overall leader of the group. Mr. Mashal has been based in Syria since he was forced to leave Jordan.
 Hamas considers its relations with Muslim and Arab states crucial because it has been ostracized by the West. The United States and the European Union regard it as a terrorist group and are not providing money directly to the Palestinian Authority now that it is dominated by Hamas.
 Hamas is calling on Muslim countries to step in and provide additional assistance, but so far the response has been tepid.

HEADLINE: Populist Movements Wrest Much of Latin America From Old Parties

BYLINE: By JUAN FORERO

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, April 14 

 BODY:
The past is always on display at the imposing headquarters of the Popular Action Party. Meeting halls are adorned with black-and-white pictures of party leaders, men whose hold on Congress was once indisputable.
 But in a trend mirroring the sagging fortunes of traditional political parties across Latin America, Peruvians elected only four Popular Action candidates to the 120-member Congress this month, and the party's candidate for president finished a distant fifth.
 From Venezuela to Argentina, many of the traditional parties that built dynasties through patronage and hard-knuckle politics -- but also offered stability, a clear ideology and experienced functionaries ready to govern -- are disintegrating. Disillusioned by corruption and a failure to deliver prosperity, voters are increasingly captivated by new, mostly leftist movements promising to redistribute wealth, punishing traditional parties and turning political systems on their heads.
 The upheaval has come as Latin Americans have grown frustrated with Washington-backed economic prescriptions like unfettered trade and privatization. The new leaders and movements they bring to power, though, threaten to create a political free-for-all that could weaken already unstable countries. 
 ''There's a crisis in the political system in Latin America that goes hand in hand with the economic crisis,'' said Ivan Hinojosa, a political analyst at Catholic University in Lima. ''Some parties recuperate, but many do not, and in their place you have all these new, unpredictable movements.''
 In Peru, voters in the recent presidential election gave the most votes to Ollanta Humala, whose Nationalist Party was formed just last year. Mr. Humala, 43, said traditional politicians simply had not delivered, leaving voters looking ''not just for a new message but a new messenger.''
 ''These people are the same candidates from 20, 30 years ago,'' he said in an interview, speaking of traditional politicians and their parties. ''They are grayer, a little fatter, but they are the same people, and they've destroyed the country.''
 The change is seen as far south as Argentina, where one of two longtime governing parties, the Radical Civic Union, has been on the margins of power since its leader, Fernando de la Rua, resigned as president in 2001 as the economy collapsed. As far north as Costa Rica, the Social Christian Unity Party has been left in disarray by corruption scandals that enveloped two of the party's former presidents.
 In Venezuela, Democratic Action and Copei, two parties that divided the spoils of an oil-producing economy for 40 years, have been so debilitated by Hugo Chavez's seven-year presidency that they backed out of parliamentary elections in December and lost all representation in the 167-seat National Assembly. 
 But it is in the five Andean countries where traditional parties have been most buffeted, and where the alternatives have been the most unpredictable.
 In Bolivia, the election in December of Evo Morales, an Aymara Indian, as president signaled the obliteration of one traditional party and upheaval for three others that had dominated politics since the country's return to democracy in 1982. Even the once omnipresent National Revolutionary Movement, which led the country's epic 1952 revolution, won just a handful of congressional seats.
 Colombia's two traditional parties have been so battered by President Alvaro Uribe's influence that one of them, the Liberals, lost 12 of their 29 Senate seats in elections in March, while the other, the Conservatives, have been co-opted into a coalition of pro-Uribe movements.
 Across Latin America, the political tumult has gathered momentum with the introduction of decentralization, which since the 1990's has permitted voters in several countries to choose their own mayors and other local leaders for the first time. Increasingly aggressive and sometimes independent news media have also heaped scorn on old parties, while lending visibility to new movements.
 Chris Sabatini, senior director of policy at the Americas Society-Council of the Americas, said the shifting political terrain had given voice to long-ignored regions and made issues like schools, crime and public works crucial in local elections. 
 ''We shouldn't romanticize the old parties,'' Mr. Sabatini said. ''They were not democratic, and they were patronage-driven. They were tied to the economic elite old order, and they were simply not up to the task of adapting.''
 But the new movements often lack the cohesion and direction of traditional parties and, in many cases, much of an ideology.
 Some movements, like Mr. Chavez's Fifth Republic Movement in Venezuela or Mr. Uribe's U Party in Colombia, are beholden to the cult of personality built around their leaders. Many lack capable technocrats that the most successful traditional parties drew on to fill crucial government posts.
 Moreover, the new movements sometimes appear and disappear so quickly that voters are never really able to determine what they are offering, aside from nebulous promises of change. In Peru there are now 36 parties, or one for every 450,000 voters, and only six of them are more than a decade old, said Rafael Roncagliolo, who studies political parties for the Lima-based Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance.
 Even Mr. Humala's movement, which is expected to become the largest bloc in Congress once votes are tabulated from the April 9 election, is such a loose assortment of politicians that desertions are considered inevitable.
 ''They do not have a doctrine to support a plan of governance,'' said Gaston Acurio, 75, a former senator and member of Popular Action since 1956, when it was founded. ''You don't know what you're going to get with these movements. If there's no ideology, then the politician does what he wants.''
 Lloyd Axworthy, who led the election observers here for the Organization of American States, said having so many movements could make reform difficult. ''You've got to get to a point where you have 3 or 4 parties, not 21,'' Mr. Axworthy said. ''You have to get majorities to pass law.''
 Nonetheless, the resentment, even fury, at the old-line parties is so great that Latinobarometro, a Chilean public opinion group that surveys political attitudes across the continent, says political parties ranked last, with only a 19 percent confidence level, among Latin American institutions.
 In Peru, the breakdown of the parties began with Alberto K. Fujimori, who won the presidency 16 years ago by railing against the party system and, within two years, dissolved Congress.
 After Mr. Fujimori's government collapsed in scandal in 2000, many parties felt that the parties would regain legitimacy. But as regional parties won big victories, some of the traditional parties were left with little representation in rural Peru.
 Now, after the April 9 general elections, Peru's political landscape has been further redrawn. The party of President Alejandro Toledo, Peru Possible, once the majority party in Congress, is virtually gone. In its place are Mr. Humala's movement and others like the Alliance for the Future, which is led by Keiko Fujimori, the former strongman's daughter.
 Valentin Paniagua, who was Popular Action's candidate for president, said traditional parties had become easy scapegoats for populists looking to score points with voters. 
 The adjustment is not easy for Popular Action, the party that is famous in Peru for its founder, Fernando Belaunde Terry, who was twice president and renowned for bringing infrastructure to the countryside. The party's politicians know they have less influence, and they have a harder time raising money to keep the party operating.
 ''There are leaders who, through their own jealousies and selfishness, did not let in new leaders, and you can see the results in the latest voting,'' said Yohny Lescano, a Popular Action congressman.

HEADLINE: Uzbeks Ship Bomb-Grade Waste to Russia

BYLINE: By C. J. CHIVERS

DATELINE: MOSCOW, April 19 

 BODY:
The United States National Nuclear Security Administration said Wednesday that it had completed the removal of about 139 pounds of weapons-grade nuclear fuel from a small reactor in Uzbekistan and transferred the material to a secure storage site in Russia.
 The transfer, completed in secrecy late Wednesday in Chelyabinsk, Russia, was the first return of spent fuel from a reactor in a former Soviet republic to Russia, where the fuel originated during the Soviet era. Previous transfers have involved fresh reactor fuel, which is easier to handle. 
The move was one of four such transfers from Uzbekistan underwritten by the United States since January, and it capped an unusual instance of intensive cooperation between the countries. Relations have soured since Uzbek security forces and armored vehicles opened fire on escaped inmates and antigovernment demonstrators last year in the northeastern city of Andijon.
 ''This kind of cooperation is important, and is especially important when times are tough politically,'' Jon R. Purnell, the American ambassador to Uzbekistan, said in a telephone interview. 
 The return of the fuel cost about $11 million. American officials say fuel repatriation programs, supervised by the National Nuclear Security Administration with the cooperation of Russia and the International Atomic Energy Agency, are an important element of international nonproliferation efforts, consolidating widely scattered collections of dangerous materials.
 Highly enriched uranium fuel in large enough quantities could be made into a crude nuclear bomb, and there was enough in this case. 
 Moreover, spent nuclear fuel, stored at many reactors around the world at various levels of security, is often highly radioactive. If it is stolen or illegally sold, terrorists could combine the material with conventional explosives to make a so-called dirty bomb that could spread the radioactive waste over a wide area. 
 The spent fuel in the current transfer accumulated for decades in storage pools beside a research reactor at the Institute of Nuclear Physics outside Tashkent, the Uzbek capital. Its removal was made public after the last of the material, packed into shipping casks, arrived at its destination in Russia. 
 Retrievals of fresh fuel, begun in 2002, have been conducted from several countries, including Bulgaria and the Czech Republic, formerly part of the Soviet bloc, and Latvia, a former Soviet republic. But the mission in Uzbekistan was an example of a post-Soviet nation that has poor relations with the United States quietly cooperating on a security issue.
 Uzbekistan's Foreign Ministry did not reply to written questions about the fuel repatriation. But the collaboration appeared to reflect a shared sense of pragmatism and not a larger shift in relations; there has been no public sign of a breakthrough on the main issues that have undermined the ties between the countries. 
 Survivors of the bloodshed in Andijon say that hundreds of unarmed people were killed by indiscriminate Uzbek fire, including many women and children, during the crackdown on political opposition last May. Since the crackdown, Uzbekistan's diplomatic relations with the West, especially with the United States, have sharply deteriorated.
 President Islam A. Karimov has publicly accused Washington of deploying Islamic terrorists to destabilize Uzbekistan, and the Uzbek security services, which sit atop an authoritarian police state, have cracked down further on civil society. 
 Independent organizations have been shuttered, opposition figures and human rights advocates arrested and jailed, and independent journalists beaten, detained or harassed.
 Most Western journalists have been denied entrance to the country, often repeatedly, and news organizations that had a longstanding presence there, including the BBC, have left under official pressure.
 Late last year American forces vacated a military airfield in southern Uzbekistan that they had been using since 2001. Many of Mr. Karimov's top security officials have faced punitive sanctions from the European Union.
 Despite the poor state of the relationship, the United States went to lengths to thank the Uzbek government for its cooperation on nuclear nonproliferation, as it did Russia and Kazakhstan, which allowed the shipment of the spent fuel across its territory by train.
 Ambassador Purnell and Andrew Bieniawski, the American nuclear administration official who supervised the Uzbek fuel repatriation, said the United States had further plans for collaboration with Uzbekistan, including underwriting the conversion of the reactor so that it will use low-enriched uranium, which carries fewer risks.
 In spite of its public stance against the United States, Uzbekistan has accepted other forms of aid and collaboration, including help with border control. It has also accepted about $4 million this year from the United States Agency for International Development for health care programs, including H.I.V. and tuberculosis care and prevention and maternal health, as well as another $2 million in economic aid, including microcredit for small businesses, the embassy said.

HEADLINE: Storm Evacuees Placing Strains On Texas Hosts

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

DATELINE: HOUSTON, April 15 

 BODY:
To the long list of adjectives used to describe Texans since last summer's hurricanes -- munificent, intrepid, scrappy -- add one more: fed up. 
 Seven months after two powerful hurricanes blew through the Gulf Coast, elected officials, law enforcement agencies and many residents say Texas is nearing the end of its ability to play good neighbor without compensation.
Houston is straining along its municipal seams from the 150,000 new residents from New Orleans, officials say. Crime was already on the rise there before the hurricane, but the Houston police say that evacuees were victims or suspects in two-thirds of the 30 percent increase in murders since September. The schools are also struggling to educate thousands of new children. 
 To the east of here, Texans argue that Hurricane Rita, which took an unexpected turn away from Houston shortly after Hurricane Katrina last fall to wreak havoc from Jasper to the northeast to Sabine Pass near the Louisiana border, has been forgotten in the swirl of attention given to the devastation in New Orleans. 
 In fact, they say, the nation never really took notice of the 77,000 homes made uninhabitable by Hurricane Rita's force, 40,000 of which were not insured, or the piles of debris and garbage that still fester along the roads. ''Personally I am sick of hearing about Katrina,'' said Ronda Authement, standing outside her trailer in Sabine Pass, where she will live until she can get the money and the workers to put her three-bedroom house back on its foundation. ''I would like to throw up, frankly, hearing about Katrina.''
 In its frustration, Texas has thrown its hat in the great Congressional money game, arguing vociferously for federal money to help pay for new police officers in Houston, where the force has dwindled in recent years, and to repair homes in East Texas, where many poor residents lack the means and the insurance to do it on their own. 
 Though the state has requested $2 billion in federal aid to pay for law enforcement, education and housing, state officials say they have received only $22 million so far.
 ''We were told we would be taken care of by everybody on the federal level,'' said Chris Paulitz, a spokesman for Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas, who recently helped get $380 million in aid added to President Bush's latest supplemental request for Texas. ''But clearly that isn't the case. Texas opened its doors and hearts, and that is something we will continue to do today. However, we need to be reimbursed.''
 Houston's relationship with its added population is subtle and at times ambivalent. Residents, atomized over a broad swath of land with few interneighborhood connections, seem at one level to be dedicated to helping their neighbors, and are quick to cite numerous examples of continued volunteerism and the improved lives of children who they say are getting a better education than they received in New Orleans.
 But they are also keenly aware of spikes in crime, especially in Southwest Houston, where the majority of the poorest New Orleanians settled. 
 ''The city of Houston bent over backwards for these people, and I am glad we did it,'' said Scott Wilson, 43, who lives in the Montrose section. ''But now we are absorbing some of their problems.''
 Evacuees have been victims of or accused of committing 39 of the 235 murders in Houston since last September, said Houston's police chief, Harold Hurtt. In January alone, there was a 34 percent rise in felonies over the previous year in the city. 
 ''I can't tell you what percentage of that group is evacuees,'' Chief Hurtt said. ''But I am sure they are really represented in that group.''
 Chief Hurtt said that some of the gangs that once operated in New Orleans housing projects had relocated to Houston, a city plagued with its own gang problems. 
 In response, the city moved 100 officers working in city jails to high-crime areas, and greatly increased overtime, a tall order for a department that has lost 800 officers to retirement over the last two years.
 The city has asked the federal government for $77 million to hire 560 officers over five years. At Senator Hutchison's request, the Department of Justice recently sent the Police Department $20 million to help pay for patrolling high-crime areas.
 The Houston public school system, with about 208,000 students, also wants money to pay for more teachers, additional facilities and tutoring help for its roughly 30,000 evacuee children. The New Orleans schools, surrounded by far greater poverty than Houston, are among the nation's most troubled. 
 Houston's school system has also experienced fighting between local and New Orleans students in its schools -- 27 students from the two sides were arrested in one melee -- but school crime is down over all.
 ''It has been a challenge,'' said Terry Abbott, a spokesman for Houston Independent School District, ''but generally the vast majority of the children are well behaved and many are grateful to be here.'' 
 But results on standardized tests suggest that ''the students from Louisiana were substantially behind the Texas kids,'' Mr. Abbott said. 
 ''We have asked the state government for resources to get them up to speed,'' said Mr. Abbott, with an eye toward regulations of the federal No Child Left Behind law. ''That will be a concern, but these children are ours now, and we don't look at them in any other way.''
 In East Texas, state officials are seeking roughly $1 billion in new federal block-grant money to house people whose homes were destroyed by Hurricane Rita. 
 Texas officials concede that their coast was not pummeled nearly as badly as their neighbors in Louisiana, but they argue that their residents did not evacuate and were now trying to live in squalid, mold-infested conditions. 
 ''I have been to the Ninth Ward,'' said Mark Viator, chairman of the Recovery Coalition of Southeast Texas, speaking of the most devastated neighborhood in New Orleans. ''There is debris in the Ninth Ward, but you don't have people. We say, send the money where the people are.''
 Henry Bowie, who lives in Port Arthur, a city with high unemployment and many poor residents, is the sort of person Mr. Viator thinks should get federal housing money. His house is a patchwork of broken roofing, and light is visible through the floorboards because the house is off its foundation. Black mold grows up the sides of the walls, but Mr. Bowie, who undergoes dialysis three times a week, remains there with his wife and teenage son. 
 Not everyone is sympathetic to the needs of Texas, where oil refinery businesses continue to take in millions of dollars in profits monthly, even though state officials say they do not have enough workers because of a housing shortage. In testimony at a recent appropriations hearing, Senator Christopher S. Bond, Republican of Missouri, said he did not believe Texans needed housing money. 
 ''Texas, in the best role of traditional Judeo-Christian charity, provided benefits,'' Mr. Bond said. ''I think it's time we get back to being a good neighbor and not a paid companion.'' 
 Senator Hutchison, who spoke next, was not amused. 
 Mayor Guy N. Goodson of Beaumont, where thousands of homes were damaged, said he would like to see federal reimbursements for debris removal there rise to 90 percent of costs from 75 percent, equaling what it was in Louisiana. Mayor Goodson said his area suffered inattention because its residents had done the right thing: evacuating and rebuilding without complaint after Hurricane Rita cut its path. 
 ''There is a great disjoinder in people's minds about disaster,'' he said. ''You see wildfires, you see a tornado, and who can forget the pictures of the Ninth Ward. A vast majority of our area is wind damage. And unfortunately from a sensory standpoint, people just don't coordinate these two very similar disasters.''


CORRECTION-DATE: April 22, 2006

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Thursday about strain on government services in Texas caused by hurricane evacuees misstated the number of evacuee children in Houston public schools and the amount of Federal aid the state has received. The most recent count, in late February, showed 5,475 students, not 30,000. The aid is $222 million, not $22 million.

The chief executive, Hank McKinnell, said Pfizer would buy back $1 billion of its shares in the second quarter after buying $1 billion in the first. Pfizer also raised its 2006 earnings forecast, citing lower expenses because of its plan to cut $4 billion from annual costs by 2008. [C13.]

HEADLINE: A Peaceful Call to Arms

BYLINE: By Paul Kane. 
Paul Kane, a Marine who served in Iraq and a fellow at the Kennedy School of Government, is writing a book about national service and sacrifice.

DATELINE: Cambridge, Mass. 

 BODY:
THE American public needs to be prepared for what is shaping up to be a clash of colossal proportions between the West and Iran.
 President Franklin D. Roosevelt masterfully prepared Americans before the United States entered World War II by initiating a peacetime draft under the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940.
Now, President Bush and Congress should reinstitute selective service under a lottery without any deferments. 
 This single action will send a strong message to three constituencies in the crisis over Iran's nuclear intentions -- Iran, outside powers like China and Russia and Americans at home -- and perhaps lead to a peaceful resolution.
 Iran's leaders and public will see that the United States is serious about ensuring that they never possess a nuclear weapon. The Chinese and Russian governments will see that their diplomatic influence should be exercised sooner rather than later and stop hanging back. But most important, America's elites and ordinary citizens alike will know that they may be called upon for wartime service and sacrifice.
 President Bush has the perfect credentials overseas to execute this move, and little political capital at home to lose at this stage. Polls confirm that a wide majority of people in many countries view him and the United States as the major threat to global peace. Why let them down on this count? Go with the flow.
 President Ronald Reagan was the past master of using this strategy during the cold war. Reagan capitalized on his image as the madman at the helm to keep the Russians off balance, using the signs of war to dissuade our foes and avert actual war. President Bush should take a page from Reagan's playbook.
 Iran's leaders are highly sensitive to Iranian public attitudes about the nuclear program. That, at least, is the impression one gets from a speech given behind closed doors to Iran's Supreme Cultural Revolution Council by Hassan Rowhani, the former chief nuclear negotiator with the Europeans. In the text of his remarks published last year by an Iranian policy journal, Mr. Rowhani said the nuclear issue had already created too many headlines, and that ''whatever we do, we must have the support of the public.'' 
 Engaging Iranian public opinion at a deeper level can only enhance the prospects for a peaceful settlement. By signaling to Iranians that the cost of a clandestine nuclear program will be expensive -- in blood, treasure, time and standing -- reinstitution of selective national service in the United States will alter the calculus of the crisis with Iran.
 As it now stands, we have an American administration that is determined to deny the Iranians nuclear weapons but needs time to effect regime change in Tehran. Iran's hard-line leadership, meanwhile, needs time to solve the technological challenge of enriching enough uranium to make an atomic bomb.
 Unfortunately, with time in short supply for both sides, the clash of national wills is escalating, and a military conflict seems more likely.
 President Bush should therefore consult with Congress about reinstituting selective national service by lottery for all young males and females. After 9/11, President Bush missed an opportunity to ask America's citizenry to make sacrifices in the form of military service, homeland defense and conservation that many would have accepted. Instead, he asked people to continue shopping to prop up the flagging economy.
 We should not fumble the opportunity now to begin selective service again, while the Iranians and others are watching. It may be our last best chance to avoid war with Iran.

HEADLINE: Grant Will Revive Planning To Develop New Orleans 

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Louisiana officials plan to unveil an organization today that will revive the process of creating a New Orleans rebuilding plan, using $3.5 million newly pledged by the Rockefeller Foundation. 
 The ambitious effort calls for six months of work by urban planners, architects and other experts, along with public meetings in New Orleans's 13 community districts and in the four cities that have taken in the greatest number of the displaced: Atlanta, Baton Rouge, Dallas and Houston.
Billions of dollars in federal community development grants cannot be released until a comprehensive rebuilding plan for the state is in place. Sean Reilly, a member of the board of the Louisiana Recovery Authority, which is readying the statewide plan, said the other affected parishes had completed their basic planning, leaving Orleans Parish as ''the last and most important piece of the puzzle.'' The city's Bring Back New Orleans Commission was putting neighborhood-by-neighborhood planning in place when federal financing dried up.
 The new group, the Community Fund Support Organization, will be managed by the Greater New Orleans Foundation, a local public charity. The full budget for the planning process has been estimated at $7.9 million. The portion not covered by the new Rockefeller Foundation pledge is to be raised from public and private sources.
 Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco of Louisiana applauded the grant and the planning process that it will produce.
 ''What people need is to get the right kind of information to make smart decisions for themselves, and it's the one ingredient that they have not been given,'' Ms. Blanco said in an interview. ''They just hear noises out there, but nobody has sat down in the various neighborhoods, and it has to be done that way.''
 The Rockefeller Foundation, which has already provided $3 million to Louisiana since Hurricane Katrina, is one of the nation's largest foundations, with assets of more than $3 billion.
 The sum it is providing for the planning effort is unusually large, said Darren Walker, director of the foundation's domestic program. Holding some public meetings outside the state will add to the time and expense required, Mr. Walker said, but it is essential that the people of New Orleans have a voice in the process, wherever they are.
 ''Everyone has a role to play,'' he said, adding that the effort ''marries the best of urban planning with the wisdom and local knowledge and authentic voice of community residents.''
 ''We owe it to ourselves as a nation,'' Mr. Walker said, ''to not allow this opportunity to pass.''

HEADLINE: How Dare They Use Our Oil!

 BODY:
How's this for nerve? The leader of a country that consumes more than 20 million barrels of oil a day is warning the leader of a country that consumes some 6.5 million barrels not to try to lock up world oil resources. When President Bush welcomes the Chinese president, Hu Jintao, to the White House today, the American complaint will be that China's appetite for oil affects its stance on Iran, Sudan and other trouble spots. 
 In other words, China is acting just like everyone else: subjugating its foreign policy to its energy concerns. The United States does it, too -- witness its long-running alliance with Saudi Arabia.
Still, the size of China's population -- 1.3 billion people -- puts things into an alarming context. China recently overtook Japan as the world's second-biggest consumer of oil. Its real gross domestic product is growing at 8 to 10 percent a year, and its need for energy is projected to increase by about 150 percent by 2020. China's move from bicycles to cars has accelerated its oil consumption; by 2010, China is expected to have 90 times the number of cars it had in 1990, and it will probably have more cars than America by 2030.
 That leaves the world with two options. The first is to manage energy resources better. The other is to look for another planet. Simply continuing the current trends isn't viable, especially with the growing needs of India, with its one billion people and a growing economy of its own. 
 The United States doesn't have the right to tell a third of humanity to go back to their bicycles because the party's over. Clearly, Mr. Bush and Mr. Hu must tackle energy in a real and meaningful way. That can be done only if the United States both helps China find alternative energy sources and shows that America is doing the same thing itself.
 The best possible course would be for China to leapfrog an oil-based economy and head toward sustainable alternative fuels, just as other countries are jumping past the construction of land lines for telephone service and going straight to wireless systems. China has a lot of biomass -- crops, forests and wood products -- that could be converted into ethanol. 
 China, like America, has a lot of coal. But the world can't afford for it to go ahead with a proposal to build hundreds of coal-fired power plants; that would be an environmental disaster. The United States can help stave that off by sharing clean coal technology.
 None of this cooperation will work unless the United States provides leadership by making sacrifices of its own. Asking other countries to lay off the world's oil supply so America can continue to support its gas-guzzling Hummers doesn't really cut it.

HEADLINE: China's Leader, in Seattle, Tells U.S. Not to Dwell on Divisive Issues

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN; Leslie Wayne contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: SEATTLE, April 19 

 BODY:
Gamely donning a Boeing baseball cap and mingling enthusiastically with local business executives, President Hu Jintao of China said Wednesday that his nation and the United States ''enjoy extensive common interests'' and could avoid major problems in their relationship if they ''avoid politicizing'' the issues that divide them.
 Mr. Hu, on the second day of his first visit to the United States as China's top leader, continued a charm offensive directed mainly at commercial interests and offered an overview of economic relations that broke little new ground but displayed a prodigious memory for statistical data. 
In a lunchtime address to 600 local officials and business leaders at a Boeing plant in Everett, Wash., Mr. Hu, only occasionally consulting his notes, recited the number of fixed-line telephone users in China (740 million), the installed capacity of nuclear power plants there (30,000 megawatts), China's export volume in 2005 ($1.4221 trillion) and the number of foreign-invested enterprises that have set up shop there since 1979 (530,000, including 49,000 linked to the United States), as examples of the boundless opportunities the two countries share.
 He will meet President Bush at the White House on Thursday. While their talks are likely to cover a variety of topics, including the Iranian nuclear program, religious freedom and energy policy, Mr. Hu on Wednesday mainly took aim at a recent surge of protectionist pressure in Congress and defended the mutual benefits of open trade.
 He cited research conducted by the American Chamber of Commerce in Beijing and Morgan Stanley, the investment bank, that he said underscored how trade with China was overwhelmingly beneficial to the United States.
 ''According to Morgan Stanley, in 2004 alone, high-quality yet inexpensive Chinese goods saved U.S. consumers $100 billion, and trading with China created over four million jobs in the United States,'' he said. ''The fast-growing bilateral business ties have delivered great benefits to our peoples.''
 Mr. Hu acknowledged that some problems existed in ties between the countries, calling them ''hardly avoidable.'' But unlike the Bush administration, which has laid out concerns about China's military spending, currency policy and quest for oil in considerable detail, Mr. Hu offered mostly oratorical platitudes. 
 He did not signal that he planned to reach major new accords with Mr. Bush. He stood firm on China's management of its currency, repeating the now standard line that Beijing intends to keep the exchange rate ''basically stable,'' even as he promised to move toward greater flexibility down the road. The Bush administration and Congressional leaders have said the yuan is greatly undervalued and gives China an artificial trade advantage.
 ''China and the United States are fully capable of settling the problems that have occurred in the course of business growth and keeping their business relations on a sound track,'' Mr. Hu said.
 Earlier in the day, he met a group of Chinese and American former officials and scholars who were convened in Seattle to discuss Chinese-American relations and China's rising power.
 Although the participants included former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger; William J. Perry, a former secretary of defense; and many other notables from both countries, Mr. Hu delivered a few remarks about China's ''peaceful development'' strategy and did not engage in any dialogue, participants said. 
 At the Boeing lunch, he selected two written questions from a pile submitted by people in the audience, both of which turned out to be gently worded requests for him to expand on his vision for bilateral ties.
 Before his lunch speech, Mr. Hu toured the Boeing site in a golf cart, met privately with company executives and visited a mock-up of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, a next-generation airplane. China has said it will buy 60 of the new twin-engine, widebody jets, becoming what Boeing calls a ''launch customer'' for the line of aircraft.
 As he did at Microsoft on Tuesday, Mr. Hu turned on the charm when talking about China's enthusiasm for Boeing products. He sounded at times like a Boeing salesman, rattling off statistics about past deliveries and current orders for Boeing planes, the number of Boeing aircraft Chinese airlines now fly, 542, and the amount of money China has spent buying Boeing planes since Richard Nixon's historic visit in 1972, $37 billion.
 ''Boeing is a household name in China,'' Mr. Hu said. ''When Chinese people fly, it is mostly in a Boeing plane. I'm pleased to say that I came to the United States on a Boeing plane.''
 Mr. Hu actually arrived in Seattle on Tuesday and flew to Washington on Wednesday from Paine Field, Boeing's private airport. His Air China 747-400 stood on the tarmac outside the Future of Flight museum where he spoke at lunch. 
 Alan R. Mulally, president of Boeing's commercial aircraft division, introduced Mr. Hu to a group of 5,000 Boeing workers in an event that had the aura of a pep rally. After Mr. Hu made a glowing tribute to Boeing's tradition of innovation, Mr. Mulally said simply, ''China rocks.''

HEADLINE: Rising Yuan Pushes China Upmarket

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: GUANGZHOU, China, April 19 

 BODY:
If the United States persuades China to push up the value of its currency, there could be some unintended consequences: imports of $300 shoes and computer-controlled machine tools from China instead of T-shirts and plastic toys. 
 In the short run, a stronger currency may encourage China to buy more General Electric turbines and Microsoft computer programs from the United States. That is why officials in Washington have pushed China for several years to allow the currency, the yuan, to rise sharply in value. The topic is likely to be near the top of the agenda when President Hu Jintao of China meets President Bush in Washington on Thursday. 
 A currency appreciation would make Chinese exports more expensive in foreign markets and foreign goods more competitive in China. 
 The yuan has risen against the dollar by 3.3 percent since July, and already there are side effects: businesses across China are concluding that their survival may depend on following Japanese and South Korean companies up the economic ladder as quickly as possible, selling more advanced products with fatter profit margins. 
 As a result, China is gradually moving from competing with countries like Thailand and Indonesia to vying with South Korea, southern Europe and eventually, with the likes of Germany, Japan and the United States. 
 The Hunan Huasheng Industrial and Trading Company, a 15,000-employee manufacturer in central China that produces shirts, pants and skirts made from linen and ramie, has invested in better sewing and cutting equipment. Higher quality has allowed it to shift from supplying Wal-Mart to manufacturing for Gap, Perry Ellis and Liz Claiborne, said Jeff Mo, Hunan Huasheng's vice president. ''We are competing with the Koreans,'' he said.
 Guangzhou Light Holdings Footwear, a large maker of shoes from synthetic material, is stepping up the quality and output of its genuine leather shoes. ''Our future competitors will be the Italians because they occupy the high-class market,'' said Leo Cheng, the company's deputy general manager.
 Guangdong New Zhong Yuan Ceramics in a nearby city, Foshan, has started advertising its most expensive ceramic tiles around the world in competition with Spanish and Italian products. Making less expensive tiles has become less attractive, partly because the yuan has risen, but also because wage increases have been running at 10 percent a year. ''That's why we're switching to higher-value-added products,'' said Stephen Huo, the general manager of its export department. ''If we stuck to the low-end products, we won't make profits.''
 The biggest industry, automaking, is preparing for a similar shift. Until the last year, China mainly exported extremely cheap cars, costing under $5,000 apiece, to Africa and the Middle East, especially Syria.
 But last summer, Honda started sending compact cars to Europe from a factory on the outskirts of Guangzhou, while a range of Chinese companies including Chery, Geely, Lifan and Shanghai Automotive are preparing to start shipments to the United States and Europe in the next two years.
 While the shift toward more valuable products poses a competitive challenge to industrial nations, it may help start to solve another American issue that is likely to be a priority during President Hu's visit: the protection of copyrights, patents and other intellectual property. Chinese companies may want to protect the valuable brands and designs they are developing themselves.
 Hunan Huasheng used to overproduce when it received orders for brand-name merchandise from Western companies and sell the extra shirts and other garments locally. But the company increasingly appreciates the power of a brand name in commanding clothing prices well above the cost of production. It has stopped overproducing and does not even add brand labels to many garments at the factory.
 Instead, Hunan Huasheng arranges for them to be sewn on later to reduce the risk that the garments will be misappropriated before they leave the country, Mr. Mo said.
 Guangdong New Zhong Yuan Ceramics is registering its tile designs with foreign governments. ''When we have a new product, we apply for a patent before we produce it,'' Mr. Huo said.
 American officials have lately been talking less about currency values and more about intellectual property. But in China, the value of the currency remains a bigger concern, and President Hu called again on Wednesday for a ''basically stable'' currency.
 China revalued the yuan by 2.1 percent on July 21, and has allowed it to appreciate by a further 1.2 percent since then, a pace of change that critics describe as glacial. But even this much has affected industries with already slender profit margins, like garment manufacturing, in which a few big Western retailers like Wal-Mart can play off companies and countries against each other to find the best price.
 ''We are in despair'' because of the yuan's appreciation, said Sherman Wang, general manager of the Hangzhou Kailai Neckwear and Apparel Company, in an interview on Wednesday at the Canton Fair, a big trade exposition that attracts businesses from across China. ''It's difficult for us to raise prices.''
 Many experts contend that higher wages would force China to move toward higher-priced goods, even if the yuan did not gain value. Indeed, that may already be happening, if only gradually. At Hunan Huasheng, Mr. Mo said that wages in Changsha, an inland city in central China where Hunan Huasheng is based, were climbing 15 percent a year although only now reaching $100 a month for factory workers. 
 ''They're going to go to higher-end goods whether they revalue or not,'' said Peter Morici, a business professor at the University of Maryland.
 And if the yuan did not rise, then Chinese exporters would have even more profits to invest in developing high-end goods, Mr. Morici added.
 But many executives say the appreciation of the currency, and especially the uncertainty over how much further the yuan will climb, seems to be giving this shift an extra push.
 Of course, Chinese companies that raise prices and lose sales in response to an appreciating yuan could eventually help close the American trade deficit with China. The United States currently imports six times as much from China as it exports there. Economists say that a nation's overall trade balance is more important than any single deficit or surplus with an individual country. 
 China ran a global surplus of $23.18 billion in the first quarter of this year, up from $16.48 billion in the quarter a year earlier. In contrast, the United States ran an overall trade deficit of $134.33 billion for January and February combined and has not yet released data for March.

HEADLINE: The Bank of Mom and Dad

BYLINE: By ANNA BAHNEY

 BODY:
AT 23, Jason McGuinness lives a postcollege life in Manhattan that is very nearly typical. He works as a media research analyst, making about $30,000 a year. Sharing a two-bedroom apartment on the fourth floor of a walk-up building with a roommate on the Upper East Side, his portion of the rent is $1,100 monthly. 
 The walls are decorated with pennants and posters from Syracuse University, his alma mater. He orders takeout dinners, carries peanut-butter sandwiches to work and occasionally takes in a Mets game with friends.
And like many of his peers -- educated, employed, urban-dwelling young adults -- he receives monthly assistance from his parents, in the form of a $300 check and the payment of his cellphone bill. 
 This is not the largesse of wealthy families doled out through trust funds. Nor is the money a couple of $20 bills tucked into a card at the holidays. Mr. McGuinness and others like him are the beneficiaries of an increasingly common subsidy arriving regularly from Mom and Dad, something like a family fellowship. 
 It helps to pay for housing, bills and travel expenses, and the support has been increasing for the past two decades as education is extended, marriage is delayed and young people take the scenic route from adolescence to adulthood. 
 ''Everybody I know is supporting their children in some way,'' said Gail Horowitz, Mr. McGuinness's mother, a vice president of the Zlokower Company, a public relations firm in Manhattan. Unlike young adults who ''boomerang'' back home to live with their parents -- the subject of the recent comedy ''Failure to Launch'' -- these young people live independently. But they need help to make ends meet, or put another way, to maintain a middle-class way of life. 
 The bottom line is that the assumption that financial obligations to children ended after graduation from high school or college is going the way of the pay phone. Today, parents are finding that they are on the hook for more, sometimes much more -- contributions of thousands of dollars a year to help young men and women get on their feet economically, often into their 30's. 
 The economic dilemmas facing young adults were chronicled in two recent books: ''Generation Debt'' by Anya Kamenetz and ''Strapped: Why America's 20- and 30-Somethings Can't Get Ahead,'' by Tamara Draut. Both explore how paychecks have stalled, housing costs have risen, education costs have skyrocketed and credit has become so available as to be dangerous. 
 Ms. Draut, the director of the economic opportunity program at Demos, a New York think tank, said students now leave college with an average of $20,000 in loans, which ''added to these flat-lined paychecks and high costs of living, tips people over the edge.''
 While economic stresses may be exacerbated in cities like New York, people in other areas of the country are feeling the pressures as well. Nationally, 34 percent of those between 18 and 34 receive cash from their parents annually, according to a study by the Institute of Social Research at the University of Michigan published in ''On the Frontier of Adulthood'' in 2005. Cash is only part of the picture; parents also make generous presents of clothes, cars and help with down payments.
 ''We have not seen any signs of it decreasing,'' said Bob Schoeni, an associate professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan, who is an author of the study. ''Certainly over the last couple of decades it has been increasing.'' 
 Middle-income parents earning less than $72,600 a year can expect to spend $190,980 on a child through age 17, according to 2005 government statistics. But Dr. Schoeni said that parents can plan on paying almost 25 percent of that amount again over the next 17 years, or $42,280 in 2005 dollars. This sum includes higher education but also much more.
 Parents pay $2,323 a year to help support children 25 and 26 years old, said Dr. Schoeni, and $1,556 annually for offspring 33 and 34. (All amounts are in 2001 dollars and reflect support to children living both independently and at home.)
 Nearly half of children between 18 and 34 also receive aid in the form of their parents' time -- driving them home to the city after a visit, doing laundry, taking care of grandchildren -- that has financial value. Time assistance from parents averages about 367 hours a year, or nine weeks of full-time work.
 Although some may argue that the willingness of parents to subsidize adult children is prolonging their coming of age, Dr. Schoeni said his study suggests that extended education, the exploration of career options and delayed marriage are the causes of the long transition to self-sufficiency. Parental support ''is not the driver of a delayed transition, it is a response to it,'' he said.
 Other experts say that young adults with material support from families make a smoother transition into adulthood than those struggling entirely on their own. 
 ''It may mean that they don't have to take the first job available,'' said Jeffrey Jensen Arnett, a developmental psychologist and the author of ''Emerging Adulthood: The Winding Road from the Late Teens Through the Twenties.'' 
 Parental support allows adult children to explore careers with low earning potential, to make career shifts or to maintain a quality of life. 
 ''So many of the things that I'm able to focus on now are great career-wise, but they are not monetarily rewarding,'' said Daisy Press, a singer who performs classical and avant-garde music. At 27, Ms. Press has just completed eight years of college, four at Sarah Lawrence and four more at the Manhattan School of Music. ''I wouldn't be able to do this without them,'' she said.
 That would be her parents, Reinhold and Linda Press, who are also musicians. As a bassist and singer, respectively, they have toured with Neil Diamond for the past 30 years. In addition to paying for her education, they bought her a one-bedroom apartment on the Upper West Side and are supplementing the income she receives from teaching music history part time.
 Mr. and Mrs. Press said they believe their daughter's energy and thoughts should be on her education, and now that she is pursuing a music career they want her to have the best chance possible in an unforgiving field. ''What if she had to stop and spend her days at Starbucks?'' said Mr. Press, who lives with his wife in Laguna Niguel, Calif. 
 Mrs. Press is careful to say the money is not endless; she is 57 and her husband is 68. ''It is the hard work and the passion that makes us want to help Daisy,'' she said. ''She's not a lazy slug with no direction. She keeps moving forward.''
 Like other young people in her position, she has mixed feelings about accepting money from her parents. ''I think the down side, if I can even say there is a down side, is not necessarily feeling like an adult,'' Ms. Press said. ''There is a part of me that feels like I'm 19 or 20. I don't have the emotional experience of knowing what I cost and earning what I spend. I can only imagine what it may feel like.''
 Alanna Lopez, 27, knows very well the value of money. After leaving college before graduating and returning to Manhattan to be with the man who is now her husband, Benjamin Lopez, she began working in hotel management. Then 14 months ago, she had a baby, Abigail. 
 ''Customer service was draining,'' Mrs. Lopez said. ''I would be getting home very late. It was going to be 5, 6 or 10 more years until I had a major promotion.''
 She decided to quit and study art history and education at Hunter College. But losing her income put the self-sufficiency she and her husband, a hospital receptionist, had achieved in peril. Her mother, Suzanne McGrattan, came to the rescue.
 ''She is paying for my education and a monthly stipend to cover my portion of the bills,'' Mrs. Lopez said. She'll also watch Abigail and she recently renovated the couple's kitchen and helped to furnish the apartment. ''I'm thrilled she's going back to school,'' Ms. McGrattan, a lawyer, said. ''She saw she didn't have a life. She wants to spend more time with the child.''
 Dr. Arnett, the psychologist, said young people are ambivalent about receiving money because it represents parental power. Most young people, he said, are striving for independence, to feel they have reached adulthood.
 ''But they are also generally quite ambivalent about adulthood, in general,'' Dr. Arnett added. ''You feel grown up. You have more status, more position. But it is annoying, too. You have to pay your own bills, and take on all these responsibilities.''
 While some parents earmark contributions for food and rent, others expect their children to take care of the basics while they pick up special expenses like a vacation. 
 ''I'm enjoying watching them spend their inheritance,'' Judy Maysles, a real estate agent in Manhattan, said about the support she provides to two grown children, John, 30, who works with a hedge fund in New Jersey, and Celia, 27, a filmmaker. ''I'd rather spend it now and watch them and enjoy it with them. I think that a lot of my generation feel that way.''
 She bought her daughter appliances for a house in Portland, Ore. Now the proceeds from selling that property are enabling Celia Maysles to make a documentary about her late father, the documentary filmmaker David Maysles.
 Eventually, most children outgrow the need for a stipend. But the instinct of parents to give -- and of children to receive -- can linger on. When John Maysles got a dog four years ago, his mother told him he couldn't leave it alone all day.
 ''So I pay for doggy day care,'' she said. ''It is $16 a day. Probably he could afford it, but it has been on my credit card and I haven't changed it.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Prices Rise More Than Expected

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
Rising prices of energy, shelter and clothing pushed inflation higher in March, reviving fears on Wall Street that the Federal Reserve might keep ratcheting up interest rates after its May meeting.
 The jump in the price of gas at the pump was the main contributor to an overall increase in the Consumer Price Index of 0.4 percent last month, compared with a modest 0.1 percent gain in February.
But while the impact of rising fuel costs was mostly expected, analysts were more troubled by the 0.3 percent increase in core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices. It was the largest monthly rise for the index in a year. 
 ''It's not a bad inflation report,'' said Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist for the PNC Financial Services Group in Pittsburgh. ''But it is a slap in the face reminding everybody that inflation is still on the Fed's mind.''
 The change in core inflation over the entire year remained at 2.1 percent, roughly the same level it has been for the last year but right on the edge of the upper limit of the range Fed officials have said they consider to be acceptable.
 And the sharp monthly rise, which exceeded Wall Street expectations, gave some pause to economists and investors who were encouraged just a day earlier by Fed minutes that suggested the central bank was leaning toward ending its two-year sequence of rate increases with just one more rise to 5 percent, from 4.75 percent.
 On Tuesday, the minutes from the last meeting of the Fed's policy-setting committee, in late March, were released, indicating that most of its members thought the end of the rate increases ''was likely to be near.'' Investors were further soothed by the report that prices at the factory door -- also excluding food and energy -- increased by only 0.1 percent, their slowest pace since November.
 But a day later, the news was not as comforting. Long-term interest rates rose. The price of the 10-year Treasury bond fell and its yield -- which moves in the opposite direction -- increased to 5.02 percent from 4.98 percent. Stocks dived briefly before edging back up, but the price of gold rose to more than $640 an ounce, up from about $621.
 Even so, many analysts remained convinced that the new inflation report, by itself, does not change the overall outlook for interest rate moves at the central bank.
 ''Our Fed watchers say there's a consistent story that the Fed is one and done,'' said Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at the Bank of New York. ''Today's data doesn't change this story.''
 The jumpiness in financial markets over the economic reports this week underscored how it is becoming more difficult for investors to read the Fed's intentions as it nears the end of its tightening cycle.
 In part, that's because the Fed has not made clear exactly what information -- actual data on consumer and commodity prices or other indicators, like unemployment and factory utilization, which can put pressure on wages and prices -- will determine whether it is satisfied that inflation will remain under control. 
 ''The Fed doesn't know when it's going to stop, so unlike the past couple of years it can't give signals in advance to markets,'' said Nigel Gault, chief economist for the United States at Global Insight. ''The Fed's actions will be dependent on incoming data, so as data comes in it will shift around the market's expectations of the Fed's actions.''
 Besides gasoline, the rise in the price measure was also driven by the cost of shelter: apartment rents, hotel prices and, most important, what the Labor Department statisticians call homeowners' ''equivalent rent,'' which altogether make up about a quarter of the basket of goods and services used to measure consumer prices.
 Some economists said this might portend a troubling new inflationary trend in rental markets as potential homeowners deterred by high housing prices decided to rent instead.
 The price of clothing also added to overall inflation. But it tends to be particularly volatile, depending on holiday schedules and weather, which led several economists to predict that apparel prices will go back down in April.
 Now that rates have risen from their extraordinary lows of the early years of the decade, the Fed faces tougher choices as it seeks to find what it considers a ''neutral rate'' for borrowing costs, a level that neither stimulates nor retards economic growth.
 For one thing, it is still unclear how much the housing market will soften, slowing construction activity and taking some air out of household spending. 
 For another, the cooling effect of the Fed's 15 interest rate increases since June 2004 has not yet finished working its way through the economy.
 ''There's tightening in the pipeline that has not yet been manifest,'' said Richard J. DeKaser, chief economist at National City in Cincinnati.
 At the meeting in March, some members of the Fed's policy-setting meeting expressed worries that they might go too far in raising rates and risk squelching economic growth. 
 ''The Fed,'' Mr. Gault said, ''must decide whether it is confident that the slowdown will bring inflation down on its own.''

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Asia: Japan: Trade Surplus Narrowed in March

BYLINE: REUTERS

 BODY:
Japan's trade surplus narrowed in March from a year earlier as high oil prices raised import costs, but healthy export growth reinforced views that the economy was on a modest but sustainable recovery path. The trade surplus fell 11.9 percent in March from the same month a year earlier, to 978.1 billion yen ($8.34 billion), data by the Ministry of Finance showed. Exports rose 18.1 percent from a year earlier, to 6.8 trillion yen, helped in particular by vehicle exports to the United States. Exports to the United States rose 16.4 percent compared with a year earlier, while exports to China, Japan's biggest trading partner, rose 32.4 percent. Imports surged 25.2 percent, to 5.84 trillion yen.

HEADLINE: Electronic Giants Lend Hand, and Cash, to Start-Ups 

BYLINE: By James Flanigan

 BODY:
WITH a brash confidence that recalls the early days of Silicon Valley, entrepreneurial companies in San Diego are pushing the technological frontiers of cellular telephones around the world. 
 Communications industries everywhere are challenged to meet demands from hundreds of millions of people, in Asia particularly, for phones that seamlessly combine voice, data and multimedia abilities, so that cellphone users can watch longer videos and mini-movies, play interactive online games and communicate worldwide.
The industry's revealing name for the cellphone these days is ''the fourth screen,'' as in movie, television, computer and now cellphone screen. ''The dream of total communications that are with you at all times is evolving into reality,'' said David R. Shepard, president of Sequoia Communications, a semiconductor company in San Diego.
 It is an evolution carried forward by relatively small companies financed by larger electronics concerns and by venture capital funds. To be sure, the global communications industry is led by giants, including network providers like China Unicom and the largest telecom company in India, Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd., as well as AT&T, Verizon and others familiar to Americans. The cellphone makers Nokia, Motorola, Samsung and others vie for a market that is now passing one billion devices worldwide. 
 But the heartland of technological innovation lies with venture-backed companies in San Diego, as they try to advance the limits of radio frequency technology, electronic circuitry and computer software.
 One such company is the Continuous Computing Corporation, a developer of an Internet multimedia system that allows cellphones to receive and transmit voice, data and pictorial transmissions. The system is analogous ''to a personal computer's ability to offer built-in functions for numerous applications,'' explained P. J. Go, president and co-founder. 
 Mr. Go, who came from the Philippines to study at Occidental College in Los Angeles and earned an electrical engineering degree from the California Institute of Technology, sees enormous potential in Asia.
 Venture capital funds have invested $52 million in Continuous, including Intel Capital, the division of Intel, the semiconductor giant, that backs start-ups in new technologies.
 Intel is also backing the Peregrine Semiconductor Corporation, which says it recently achieved a breakthrough by implanting radio frequency in a single powerful microchip that can advance the capabilities of cellphones. The commercial product is adapted from technology developed for military satellites that Peregrine's chief executive, James S. Cable, worked on years ago for the military contractors Hughes Microelectronics Center and TRW Inc. To bring military technology to a commercial product that is smaller and sells for much less money, ''was even harder than the original work,'' Mr. Cable said. 
 Peregrine continues to supply electronics for military and space satellite uses, but the breakthrough with cellphones could make it a much larger company. Mr. Cable and his senior staff believe that Peregrine could one day have $1 billion in annual revenue, from $50 million today. The company is backed so far by investments of $141 million from nine venture funds. 
 Financing America's advanced technology with venture capital, which looks for big returns within five to seven years, is a departure from the last half-century, when the Defense Department and big corporations like Bell Laboratories, then part of AT&T, paid the bills. An expert on such times is Andrew Viterbi, a San Diego resident and the scientist who created the Viterbi algorithm, the computation that enables digital transmissions to avoid interference. That discovery not only contributed mightily to military communications but was responsible in part for the invention of the cellphone.
 ''Yes, for more than 30 years the military was a good supporter of research and development,'' Mr. Viterbi said in a recent interview. It helped him to found the Linkabit Corporation, a military contracting company, in 1968, and then to co-found Qualcomm Inc., a major source of cellphone operating systems, in 1985. 
 Yet such budgetary support for technology, which began after World War II, ''might have petered out were it not for the cold war,'' Mr. Viterbi said. ''Today we live in different times.'' Indeed, Mr. Viterbi, retired from Qualcomm, has become a venture capitalist through the Viterbi Group, a family investment firm that backs fledgling companies in San Diego and elsewhere. 
 The shift in support has not been that drastic -- ''basic research is still undertaken by universities and government laboratories,'' said James Montgomery, whose investment banking firm, Montgomery & Company, arranges financing for high-tech start-ups. ''Venture capital mainly supports the 'D' in R.& D., the development of products and applications,'' he said. 
 It is a brisk business. Montgomery & Company's annual technology conference, held recently in Santa Monica, drew 150 small companies to make half-hour presentations to some 500 managers of institutional investment and venture capital funds. 
 One presenter was Sequoia Communications, founded by John Groe, an electrical engineer from the University of Southern California, who had worked on satellite communications at TRW and then at Nokia, among other places. At Sequoia, Mr. Groe and fellow engineers have developed a microchip that can work with all the world's operating standards, thus eliminating difficulties in communicating between phones on global system mobile, originated in Europe, and code division multiple access, the standard in greater use in the United States. 
 To achieve that breakthrough, Sequoia has been backed by $38 million from four venture capital funds and from Motorola, which uses Sequoia chips in its Razr cell handsets. ''It makes sense for big companies to finance small firms trying for innovations,'' said Mr. Shepard of Sequoia. ''A big firm can't take time and effort from the products it must turn out for its customers to pursue leads that may not pan out.'' 
 Still, there is no denying widespread anxiety about America's technological leadership, particularly as high-tech work seems to migrate inexorably to the growth markets of Asia. 
 Continuous Computing, for example, now has half of its 400 employees in India and China. ''The architecture of our systems and marketing is done in San Diego,'' Mr. Go said, while software programming and circuitry -- which he calls ''implementation'' -- are performed in those countries.
 For Mr. Go, and for Continuous's co-founder, Ken Kalb, it is a matter of the company benefiting at home from business in large markets overseas.
 Mr. Kalb, a classic entrepreneur who is starting a new communications company called 4LikeMinded, sees America's continuing technological leadership as secure because of ''our political institutions that support entrepreneurial people who can come here, raise money and start a business. No other country does that.'' As a prime example, he cited an early investor in Continuous Computing -- Mr. Viterbi, who came as a child from Italy in 1939.
 As if echoing the thought, Mr. Viterbi, noted that ''information technology has propelled our economy for the last 50 years, and now we have competition.
 ''But still,'' he said, ''I'm reasonably optimistic because we're the only ones who can effectively use talented people.''

HEADLINE: Enter the Neuro-Economists: Why Do Investors Do What They Do?

BYLINE: By Tyler Cowen. 
Tyler Cowen is a professor of economics at George Mason University and is co-author of a blog, www.marginalrevolution.com. E-mail: tcowen@gmu.edu.

 BODY:
LAS VEGAS uses flashing lights and ringing bells to create an illusion of reward and to encourage risk taking. Insurance company offices present a more somber mood to remind us of our mortality. Every marketer knows that context and presentation influence our decisions. 
 For the first time, economists are studying these phenomena scientifically. The economists are using a new technology that allows them to trace the activity of neurons inside the brain and thereby study how emotions influence our choices, including economic choices like gambles and investments. 
For instance, when humans are in a ''positive arousal state,'' they think about prospective benefits and enjoy the feeling of risk. All of us are familiar with the giddy excitement that accompanies a triumph. Camelia Kuhnen and Brian Knutson, two researchers at Stanford University, have found that people are more likely to take a foolish risk when their brains show this kind of activation. 
 But when people think about costs, they use different brain modules and become more anxious. They play it too safe, at least in the laboratory. Furthermore, people are especially afraid of ambiguous risks with unknown odds. This may help explain why so many investors are reluctant to seek out foreign stock markets, even when they could diversify their portfolios at low cost. 
 If one truth shines through, it is that people are not consistent or fully rational decision makers. Peter L. Bossaerts, an economics professor at the California Institute of Technology, has found that brains assess risk and return separately, rather than making a single calculation of what economists call expected utility.
 Researchers can see on the screen how people compartmentalize their choices into different parts of their brains. This may not always sound like economics but neuro-economists start with the insight -- borrowed from the economist Friedrich Hayek -- that resources are scarce within the brain and must be allocated to competing uses. Whether in economies or brains, well-functioning systems should not be expected to exhibit centralized command and control.
 Neuro-economics is just getting started. The first major empirical paper was published in 2001 by Kevin McCabe, Daniel Houser, Lee Ryan, Vernon Smith and Theodore Trouard, all economics professors. (Professors McCabe, Houser and Smith are colleagues of mine at George Mason University.) A neuro-economics laboratory at Cal Tech, led by Colin F. Camerer, a math prodigy and now an economics professor, has assembled the foremost group of interdisciplinary researchers. Many of the early entrants, who have learned neurology as well as economics, continue to dominate the field.
 Investors are becoming interested in the money-making potential of these ideas. Imagine training traders to set their emotions aside or testing their objectivity in advance with brain scans. Futuristic devices might monitor their emotions on the trading floor or in a bargaining session and instruct them how to compensate for possible mistakes.
 Are the best traders most adept at reading the minds of others? Or is trading skill correlated with traits like the ability to calculate and ignore the surrounding caldron of human emotions?
 More ambitiously, future research may try to determine when a short-term price bubble will collapse. Does the market tide turn when people stop smiling, adjust to their adrenalin levels or make different kinds of eye contact? 
 Not all of neuro-economics uses brain scans. Andrew W. Lo, a professor at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, applied polygraph-like techniques to securities traders to show that anxiety and fear affect market behavior. Measuring eye movements, which is easy and cheap, helps the researcher ascertain what is on a subject's mind. Other researchers have opened up monkey skulls to measure individual neurons; monkey neurons fire in proportion to the amount and probability of rewards. But do most economists care? Are phrases like ''nucleus accumbens'' -- referring to a subcortical nucleus of the brain associated with reward -- welcome in a profession caught up in interest rates and money supply? Skeptics question whether neuro-economics explains real-world phenomena. 
 The neuro-economists admit that their endeavor is in its infancy. It is difficult to identify brain modules and their roles. Even if one part of the brain is active at a particular moment, how is that incorporated into a person's broader method for making decisions?
 The number of people scanned in any study is typically small, if only because the hookups cost about $500 an hour and require access to an expensive machine. Furthermore, the setting may matter. Perhaps we cannot equate choices made on the New York Stock Exchange trading floor with choices made under a hospital scanner, where the subject must lie on his back, remain motionless and endure a loud whirring, all the while calculating a trading strategy. 
 That said, neuro-economics will make huge strides as technology allows researchers to identify more brain regions and read brains more accurately and at lower cost. It is a growth area in a profession that knows human feelings matter, but does not always know what to do with them.
 The next step? Perhaps neuro-economics should turn its attention to political economy. Do people use the same part of their brains to vote as to trade? Is voting governed by fear, disgust or perhaps the desire to gain something new and exciting?

HEADLINE: Worries About Inflation Are Soothed by Earnings

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks rose modestly yesterday as solid earnings from companies including Yahoo and United Technologies offset worries about inflation.
 Technology shares scored the strongest gains. Yahoo jumped $2.24, or 7.2 percent, to $33.54. Investors were relieved that earnings were in line with expectations and that the company stood by its outlook for the year.
A government report showed the core Consumer Price Index, a gauge of inflation at the retail level, rose in March at its fastest pace in a year. That undermined enthusiasm from Tuesday when minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting supported views that the Fed was close to ending its rate-raising campaign. 
 The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note climbed back above 5 percent yesterday. The yield rose to 5.02 percent, from 4.98 percent on Tuesday. The price, which moves in the opposite direction from the yield, fell 10/32, to 95 31/32.
 The Fed's minutes on Tuesday helped give stocks their best day of gains in about a year. However, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Janet L. Yellen, speaking on CNBC after midday yesterday, expressed concern about the inflationary impact of high energy and commodity prices over the next few quarters. This created some negative sentiment.
 ''Right now, the mood is basically accentuating the positive and eliminating most of the negatives,'' said Al Goldman, chief market strategist at A. G. Edwards, adding that expectations for first-quarter earnings remained strong.
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 10 points, or 0.09 percent, to end at 11,278.77. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 2.28 points, or 0.17 percent, at 1,309.93. The Nasdaq composite index was up 14.74 points, or 0.63 percent, at 2,370.88.
 After the closing bell, shares of eBay, the Web auctioneer, fell 4.8 percent, to $38.40, after it posted a decline in quarterly profit. The stock ended the regular session at $40.35, up 3.8 percent, or $1.47, on Nasdaq, before the earnings report.
 During regular trading, the solid earnings gave investors reason to believe that the economy is healthy and took the edge off some of the anxiety about core consumer price inflation.
 ''Earnings are definitely coming in strong, and there's a lot out there with companies to be excited about,'' said Warren Simpson, managing director at Stephens Capital Management in Little Rock, Ark.
 The Dow average got its biggest lift from the industrial conglomerate United Technologies, which reported stronger-than-expected earnings and raised its full-year profit outlook. United Technologies shares climbed 6.6 percent, or $3.90, to $62.80, on the New York Stock Exchange.
 Exxon Mobil rose 1.2 percent, or 76 cents, to $64.30. Shares of other energy companies also climbed, with the oil equipment and servicing company Schlumberger up 5.1 percent, at $67.75. 
 Crude oil for May delivery hit a record high for the second consecutive day, climbing to $72.40 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange after government data showed a surprising drop in crude inventories. May crude settled 82 cents higher at $72.17 a barrel. 

Profit for NYSE Group
By Reuters
 The NYSE Group, owner of the New York Stock Exchange, said yesterday that its quarterly profit rose nearly 17 percent, in its first earnings report since going public. Net income was $30.3 million, or 24 cents a share, against $26 million, or 22 cents a share, a year ago.
 The figure includes a $37.7 million charge, mainly related to a compensation to employees during the merger, and a $20.9 million gain on the sale of an investment in the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation.

HEADLINE: Panel Calls on Governments To Reveal Derivatives Risks

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
After watching hundreds of towns, school districts, power utilities, port authorities and other government bodies plunge headlong into the derivatives markets over the last few years, accounting rule makers have decided those governments should reveal the extent of their involvement with the exotic instruments, and spell out what risks they may pose for taxpayers and bondholders.
 Once used almost exclusively by corporate risk managers, derivatives have recently become a popular tool for local governments seeking to reduce their cost of borrowing. Instead of simply issuing bonds, as they did in the past, governments now often issue bonds and simultaneously enter into derivatives contracts, usually of a type known as interest rate swaps. 
The swaps are supposed to protect governments from adverse interest rate swings. Their popularity soared in the recent economic downturn, when tax revenues dwindled and governments were looking for new ways to raise money. Experts say that enough time has elapsed for a fading of memories of the disastrous encounter that Orange County, Calif., had with derivatives in 1994.
 Some of the renewed enthusiasm was apparently kindled by swap contracts that included big upfront payments to the governments -- a powerful temptation for officials struggling to balance their budgets. 
 When swaps perform as advertised, they do indeed make it cheaper for governments to borrow. But when something goes wrong, they can wreak havoc.
 Experts say blowups are the exception. But because governments are not required to report the details of their swap activity, no one knows for sure the extent of the total exposure, or where the trouble spots may lie.
 ''The public needs to better understand the nature of these transactions,'' said Robert H. Attmore, chairman of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board, an independent group that writes accounting rules for state and local governments.
 The seven-member board voted Tuesday to proceed with a project to make governments provide much more information about their use of derivatives.
 One example of what can go wrong is now playing out at the Delaware River Port Authority, which handles bridges, railroads and other transportation services near Philadelphia for Pennsylvania and New Jersey.
 In 2001, the port authority was planning to sell $358 million of bonds. Officials wanted to economize by using a floating interest rate, much as a home buyer might choose a variable-rate mortgage because it has a lower interest rate than a fixed-rate mortgage.
 But the port authority also wanted to protect itself from future interest rate increases. So it struck a side agreement with UBS Securities, involving a type of derivative called an interest rate swap option, or swaption.
 The swaption gave UBS an option which, if exercised, would start streams of payments between the port authority and UBS. The terms meant that UBS would get the larger payment if interest rates fell below a certain point, and the port authority would get larger payments if rates rose above it. The swap was thus meant to serve as a hedge for the port authority, with the possible stream of payments from UBS offsetting the rising amounts it would have to pay its bondholders if rates moved up. 
 The concept may have been sound, but in the real world things turned out differently. Before the bonds could be issued, the governors of Pennsylvania and New Jersey had a falling-out over plans to dredge a long stretch of the Delaware River. That caused a split on the port authority's board, making it impossible to issue the bonds. Meanwhile, interest rates have remained low, prompting UBS to exercise its swap option and start collecting its money. 
 Now the authority must make payments to UBS every month, even though the bonds were never sold.
 Officials of the port authority confirmed these details but declined to comment further.
 The port authority's recent financial statements do not show that the problems were looming. In 2003, the port authority did disclose, in its footnotes, that it had entered into several interest rate swap options in exchange for upfront payments totaling $40 million from three financial services firms. The footnotes explained that the port authority would be exchanging a stream of payments with UBS for many years if UBS exercised its option. But they did not show how big the payments might be, or explain the risks.
 Randal J. Finden, who is managing the accounting board's derivatives project, said interest rate swaps can be tricky to evaluate because they sometimes go through periods when they look like losers, only to recover when interest rates change. He has been trying to devise a series of tests that would identify swap agreements that are irretrievable failures. 
 In his approach, governments that find they are caught in unsuccessful swap contracts would be required to show the failures on their balance sheets. They would report a liability in the amount that it would cost to buy out of the swap contract. 
 Getting out of a failed swap can mean making a huge payment. 
 The port authority's swap with UBS would probably fail the tests Mr. Finden is devising, because the swap is not serving any valid hedging purpose. 
 The accounting board has no regulatory power, and Mr. Finden, the derivatives project's manager, said the board was not trying to discourage governments' use of derivatives.
 Still, public finance experts say that fuller disclosure would bring failed derivatives out into the open quickly. That, in turn, could motivate governments to cut their losses when a swap contract fails, rather than pouring more money into an unsuccessful transaction in hopes that interest rates will eventually turn in their favor. 
 Peter L. Block, a director in Standard & Poor's government ratings division who has been analyzing governments' use of swaps, said analysts like him were eager to see what would show up once the new accounting procedures come into force. 
 Mr. Block said he was guessing that most swaps would pass the coming accounting test.
 ''If 98 percent are stable,'' he said, ''you want to know about the 2 percent that aren't, because you might have big exposure to them.''

HEADLINE: It's Pitching-In Time for Tenants as Looming Strike Forces Self-Help

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT; Steven Greenhouse contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
The denizens of several thousand New York City apartment buildings have launched into that triennial rite of spring -- volunteering for doorman duty, garbage detail and elevator operation in anticipation of a possible walkout by building service workers, which may (or may not) happen at 12:01 a.m. tomorrow when their current three-year contract expires.
 In 3,500 cooperative, condominium and rental buildings where the 28,000 workers are members of Local 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union, residents went through the familiar motions yesterday, lining up conscripts to clean floors, sort mail, haul trash and work lobster shifts at the front door in the lonely hours before dawn. 
If anyone was ruffled, it was not apparent. Some even reminisced fondly about the last strike, which lasted 12 days in 1991, and which they recalled as one of those felicitously benign New York City disruptions in which people neither die nor lose their shirts but instead share cabs, barbecue on sidewalks and congratulate themselves on their indomitable spirit.
 ''It was like a big party,'' recalled Michael Lorimer, a classical guitarist and president of the board of a 16-floor, prewar co-op on Amsterdam Avenue and 73rd Street with an elevator still manually operated. ''People were running the elevator and there was like a real feeling of community and we're-going-to-get-through-this.''
 Andrew Rubin, who owns a co-op on West 67th Street in a 270-unit building with a staff of 18, said that every one-hour shift for front-desk duty had already been filled for the first two days if there is a strike. A nonunion security guard has been retained. Nine hardy residents have signed up to lug trash from the basement to the curb.
 Extra garbage bags have been stockpiled so residents can take their own trash to the basement. A list will be posted in the lobby soliciting volunteers to vacuum halls, hose sidewalks, sweep the basement -- jobs Mr. Rubin, a member of the co-op board, said he was planning to do every evening after returning home from the gym.
 ''I'm ecstatic to say we've done many things,'' said Mr. Rubin, the chief operating officer for the New York University School of Medicine's faculty group practice. ''I feel we're pretty much as ready to go as any building in the city could possibly be.''
 The union and the building owners and managers remained divided yesterday over wages, pensions and health coverage. James F. Berg, the chief negotiator for the industry, said shortly before 6 p.m. that the two sides had made little progress on core economic issues. Sounding slightly more optimistic than on Tuesday, he said, ''We've had productive discussions that have brought us closer together, but there is still a gulf between us.''
 The industry group, the Realty Advisory Board on Labor Relations, continued to demand a one-year pay freeze, saying it was justified by the large outlays the industry had made to bail out the union's health insurance fund.
 Meanwhile, in a union-sponsored news briefing, Hugh Kelly, an expert in real-estate economics, said the industry could easily afford wage and benefit increases at a rate higher than that of inflation. Mr. Kelly, who runs a consulting firm, said that rents were soaring and that the industry was not as hard-pressed as it claimed.
 At a City Hall news conference, the city comptroller, William C. Thompson Jr., cautiously backed the union while trying to avoid offending the owners. He said: ''Year round, they take care of New York families and keep our apartment buildings clean, safe and secure. Now it is time to ensure they receive a fair share so that they can provide for their own families.''
 For residents, there has been no shortage of guidance on how to prepare, including booklets with titles like ''In the Event of a Strike'' (Ninth Edition, March 2006), from the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums, and ''Residential Building Preparedness Information'' from the Realty Advisory Board. Both are replete with sample job assignment charts, sample notices to residents and sample signs.
 They also include advice on topping off oil tanks in advance, checking boilers and water tanks, printing identification cards for residents, setting up a committee to check on the frail and elderly, collecting mail from the post office if necessary, talking to service contractors in case of emergencies, arranging for package delivery and more.
 ''We have to go through the same routine every three years and prepare buildings as if there were going to be a strike,'' said Dan Wurtzel, chief operating officer of Cooper Square Realty.
 Management companies have been dispatching communiques to co-op boards and residents for weeks. Paul J. Herman, an executive vice president and director of management at Brown Harris Stevens, said his firm would have ''command center'' staffed round the clock to handle emergencies.
 Residents have been warned that all renovation projects will halt for the duration of a strike. Plans to move in or out of buildings will be postponed. Laundry room hours may be limited. Tenants will be expected to cancel large furniture deliveries and meet all guests and takeout delivery people in the lobby.
 Fredi Weintraub Baer, a member of the board of directors of her East 72nd Street co-op and a strike-committee member, was in the lobby at dusk this week signing up volunteers. ''I've headed the committee, but I've never been through a strike,'' Mrs. Baer said. ''Hopefully, my record will not be broken.''

HEADLINE: Unified Financial Plan Is Presented for Ground Zero

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
After months of political bickering and false starts, officials from the Pataki, Corzine and Bloomberg administrations said last night that they were finally in agreement on a workable financial plan to rebuild at ground zero and have the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey take control of the Freedom Tower.
 The officials said the plan amounted to a blueprint for rebuilding the entire 16-acre World Trade Center site by 2012, with the authority providing $100 million for the Sept. 11 memorial.
Kenneth J. Ringler, the authority's executive director, and Anthony R. Coscia, its chairman, met last night with the developer Larry A. Silverstein, who controls the site, to formally present the unified offer. Mr. Silverstein faces a hard choice: agree to the plan and give up control of about a third of the site or, perhaps, head to court. 
 The unified plan was put together by Gov. George E. Pataki, Gov. Jon S. Corzine and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg after nearly three weeks of wary negotiations. 
 If Mr. Silverstein accepts it, the officials said a deal would signal a major realignment at ground zero, clearing the way for construction to begin on the $2 billion Freedom Tower, the biggest, costliest and most symbolic skyscraper planned for the site. That, in turn, could restore public confidence in the project and allay fears that the money will run out before the work is finished. 
 For Governor Pataki in particular, who is leaving office and may harbor presidential ambitions, a deal could put an end to the embarrassing squabble over a project to which he has tied his legacy, the Freedom Tower.
 Details of the plan were described by officials from the city, both New Jersey and New York State, and the Port Authority. They included Mr. Ringler and Mr. Coscia from the authority; John P. Cahill, Mr. Pataki's chief of staff, who now oversees Lower Manhattan redevelopment; and Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff. They insisted that the proposal was fair to Mr. Silverstein, who will retain the right to build three office towers on the most valuable parcels, though on a strict timetable. The Bloomberg administration and the Port Authority are also offering to lease 1.2 million square feet in the buildings.
 Until now, the rebuilding process has been held up by political differences among the government agencies, questions about the financial prospects of the Freedom Tower and uncertainty over Mr. Silverstein's ability to finish the $7 billion project when only $2.9 billion in insurance money was available. 
 ''We're now in agreement on how to move forward,'' said Charles A. Gargano, vice chairman of the authority and Mr. Pataki's chief economic development official. ''I'm hopeful that the Silverstein Properties will accept the recent offer, so we can start building the Freedom Tower as quickly as possible.''
 Senator Charles E. Schumer, who has been supportive of Mr. Silverstein and critical of the political maneuvering at ground zero, embraced the proposal last night.
 ''This sets the parameters for the best deal possible under the circumstances,'' Mr. Schumer said. ''I urge Larry Silverstein to accept it, if the numbers work.''
 Bud Perrone, a spokesman for Silverstein Properties, said: ''We welcome the government's willingness to resume negotiations. The Silverstein team will undertake a thorough review of the proposal.''
 The latest impasse arose with the groundbreaking for the Freedom Tower, which had been planned for this month. There was also a growing realization that there was not enough money to rebuild the entire site, although Mr. Silverstein insisted that he could do the job. 
 Mr. Pataki had championed the Freedom Tower, the largest of five proposed towers, as a way of restoring New York's skyline with a symbol of resilience. But the skyscraper is widely considered to be too big, in the wrong place and nearly impossible to lease to corporate tenants, who consider it a potential terrorist target. 
 Mr. Bloomberg raised the possibility that Mr. Silverstein would build only two towers before running out of money in 2009, defaulting on his lease and walking away from the project with hundreds of millions of dollars. Better to deal with the problem now, he said. 
 Mr. Coscia of the Port Authority also called for a new arrangement with Mr. Silverstein, who leased the trade center from the authority in July 2001, six weeks before it was destroyed.
 In negotiations over the past four months with Mr. Cahill, Mr. Silverstein tentatively agreed to a deal in which the Port Authority would take control of building the Freedom Tower and one other building. But City Hall, New Jersey and authority commissioners on both sides of the Hudson felt that the Pataki administration's plan shifted all the risk to the authority while enriching Mr. Silverstein.
 Mr. Silverstein has blamed government ineptitude for the gridlock. But now government officials are claiming a breakthrough.
 ''We believe that this proposal represents a significant turning point,'' Mr. Coscia said. ''It provides a fair platform for all the parties to cooperate on rebuilding. It creates an opportunity to accelerate and energize the process.''
 Under the unified government plan described yesterday, the Port Authority would take control of the Freedom Tower project, using $1.7 billion in tax-free Liberty Bonds and about $970 million in insurance money. Mr. Silverstein would be paid to build it. The Pataki administration would provide $250 million and has pledged to secure leases for about one million square feet from federal agencies, which would enable the authority to obtain additional financing. Mr. Schumer said last night that federal customs officials were interested in a large block of the space. 
 The authority would also take control of a site on Greenwich Street, which it would probably sell to a residential developer.
 Mr. Silverstein, in turn, would develop three office towers along Church Street, between Vesey and Liberty Streets. To ensure that he builds quickly, the city and the Port Authority are offering to lease 1.2 million square feet at market rates, according to Mr. Coscia and Mr. Ringler, and the city would provide Liberty Bonds for financing. But his development fee would be restricted to 2.5 percent, not the 5 percent he originally demanded.
 In the coming months, the authority would design plans with Mr. Silverstein for a shopping mall that would be part of two of his towers, then sell it to him and a retail developer. In addition, Mr. Silverstein would be required to adhere to strict construction schedules and contribute at least $140 million toward the cost of common infrastructure.
 If Mr. Silverstein decides that the arrangement does not work for him, Mr. Coscia said he would be offered an alternative: he would be paid $50 million and given what is known as Site 5, a parcel valued at $300 million that could be the site of a residential tower.
 ''The unified offer from the public sector will ensure full financing and the build-out of the site on an expedited timetable and a deal that's fair to all the parties,'' Mr. Doctoroff said.

HEADLINE: Chief's Tone Reflects Change At Wal-Mart in the Last Year 

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

DATELINE: ROGERS, Ark., April 19 

 BODY:
A year ago, at Wal-Mart's first conference for journalists, the company's chief executive struck a feisty, at times defiant, tone toward critics of the company's health care benefits and wages. 
 Describing newspaper headlines that said, in effect. ''Wal-Mart's low prices come at too high a cost,'' the chief executive, H. Lee Scott Jr., said, ''I'd suggest a better headline: 'Wal-Mart is great for America.' ''
That conviction may not have changed, but at this year's media conference, which concluded on Tuesday, Mr. Scott's tone certainly did, a reflection of how life has changed for Wal-Mart over the last year. 
 Mr. Scott called Wal-Mart a company ''in transformation'' and offered what a year ago would have seemed an unthinkably long list of changes under way at the company, the nation's largest retailer. 
 In just the last six months, the company has expanded health insurance to the children of part-time workers, committed to sweeping reductions in energy use and is planning to support local businesses, including competitors, near its proposed urban stores. 
 To be sure, the changes may help Wal-Mart's bottom line, but Mr. Scott said his goal was ''to be better for our communities, better for our customers and better for our associates,'' as Wal-Mart calls its employees.
 Why so much change so quickly?
 Wal-Mart is loath to credit its critics with influencing the company, but Mr. Scott's message of change -- he used the word ''transformation'' five times in his speech -- coincides with the one-year anniversary of the formation of two union-backed groups, Wal-Mart Watch and Wake Up Wal-Mart, which have helped turn the company into a social, political and economic issue. 
 Organized union-backed opposition to Wal-Mart has existed, in one shape or another, for at least a decade, but it escalated sharply in 2005. Wake Up Wal-Mart and Wal-Mart Watch have staged protests, organized news conferences, set up Web logs and dug up and circulated internal company documents -- all intended to prod Wal-Mart to change. 
 ''If real, substantive change on important issues is what it will take to mute Wal-Mart criticism, then we are happy to be muted,'' said Nu Wexler, a spokesman for Wal-Mart Watch, who said Wal-Mart still needed to improve its wages and health insurance. 
 Wal-Mart says the changes are a response to the needs of its 1.3 million employees and scores of shoppers, who are increasingly concerned not just with low prices but with the company's image. 
 At times Tuesday, Mr. Scott revealed some of his impatience with Wal-Mart's critics, particularly those backed by unions. 
 In his harshest criticism of state health care mandates so far, he said a Maryland law aimed at the company was ''ridiculous'' and that it would not change Wal-Mart's plan to open up to 370 stores this year in the United States. The law, passed in January, received strong union support. 
 ''It is going to be tough to legislate Wal-Mart out of a community,'' Mr. Scott said at the close of a two-day media conference here, just a few miles from the company's headquarters in Bentonville, in northwest Arkansas.
 The Maryland law requires Wal-Mart to spend 8 percent of its payroll on health insurance. A retail trade group, which has Wal-Mart as a member, has filed a legal challenge. 
 Power over Wal-Mart's future, Mr. Scott said, ''is not with the legislature,'' but with more than 100 million Americans who shop at the company's 3,500 stores every week. 
 And, as he did last year, Mr. Scott described Wal-Mart as the first and crucial rung on the economic ladder, giving power to people worldwide, from Costa Rican farmers to retail clerks in Japan. ''In one word,'' he said, ''Wal-Mart means opportunity.''
 Not all of the changes Mr. Scott covered in his speech related to issues like health insurance and the environment. Wal-Mart being Wal-Mart, much of the focus was on growth. One new market that Wal-Mart will focus on intensely is Hispanic consumers, who Mr. Scott said ''have a greater affinity for Wal-Mart stores than any other part of the U.S. population.'' 
 Wal-Mart data shows that last year's sales at 275 stores that serve predominantly Hispanic communities rose 9 percent, far exceeding the roughly 4 percent growth in sales at individual stores in the chain. 
 In a shift, the company has begun developing stores with those customers in mind, expanding the Spanish-language music and food departments, creating a variety of Hispanic-themed gift cards and sponsoring World Cup Soccer events. 
 Mr. Scott, invoking the advice of Wal-Mart's founder, Sam Walton, said Wal-Mart had to transform itself. ''Everything around you is always changing,'' he said, reciting a line posted inside Wal-Mart offices around the world. ''To succeed, stay out in front of that change.''

HEADLINE: The High Cost of the Korean Mea Culpa

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, April 19 

 BODY:
Wednesday was a day of public apologies and acts of contrition.
 Lone Star, the Dallas-based investment firm, apologized Wednesday in response to accusations of embezzlement and other controversies that surround its multibillion-dollar investments in South Korea. The firm, which is expected to make an estimated $4.4 billion when it sells its stake in Korea Exchange Bank later this year, then said it was donating 100 billion won (about $106 million) to social programs in South Korea.
That apology and donation came hours after a similar gesture from the Hyundai-Kia Automotive Group. 
 Hyundai apologized for an escalating corruption scandal and said that as an act of contrition, the family that runs the conglomerate would donate about 1 trillion won ($1.06 billion) for social welfare programs. 
 In South Korea, donations and public apologies have become typical ways of expressing contrition. The public gestures carry a lot of weight. Politicians and business executives make such gestures in hopes of reducing possible legal punishment for their wrongdoing. 
 ''They are trying to turn around the negative public opinion and affect investigations with money; this is not right,'' Na Seong Lin, an economist at Hanyang University, said. 
 As South Korea tries to sell itself as a financial hub of Northeast Asia, the donations have raised questions about the way businesses are allowed to settle their problems in South Korea. 
 Last year, facing a problem similar to Lone Star's, the investment fund Newbridge Capital donated 20 billion won to programs to help small companies. In February, Samsung, South Korea's largest conglomerate, donated 800 billion won as it was engulfed in a corruption scandal. 
 Critics accuse the government of condoning, if not encouraging, public animosity toward foreign investors and the often unpopular family-controlled conglomerates. Mr. Na said the government had helped create an environment where the companies felt pressured to donate.
 They said donations from Lone Star and from Hyundai might appease voters in an election year. 
 But government regulators said their investigations would not be influenced by the donations. Indeed, a senior government official suggested that Hyundai and Lone Star were making the donations to try to escape their predicaments. 
 ''It's a premodern behavior to try to influence public opinions with money,'' said the official, Kwon Oh Seong, who heads the Fair Trade Commission, referring to Hyundai. ''Now, Lone Star also says it will donate some money. I consider this a slight to the South Korean people.'' 
 Hyundai's apology came a day before prosecutors planned to call in for questioning Chung Eui Sun, 35, president of Kia Motors and the son of Chung Mong Koo, chairman of the parent company, Hyundai Motor. Prosecutors are expected to question the senior Chung next week.
 In the last three weeks, prosecutors have raided offices and interviewed executives of Hyundai's affiliates. The prosecutors were investigating accusations that Hyundai created slush funds to bribe bank executives and politicians and that the company had engineered questionable deals to help Mr. Chung pass corporate control to his son. 
 Hyundai's ''statement to the people'' said the father and son would donate their 60 percent stake, worth 1 trillion won, in the Glovis Company, a logistics affiliate that delivers cars and parts shipments for Hyundai and Kia. Glovis is reportedly at the heart of Mr. Chung's effort to help his son take over the conglomerate. 
 Three hours after Hyundai's announcement, Lone Star's chairman, John Grayken, called a news conference, confirming that Lone Star had told the government that it was donating 100 billion won ''as a gesture of good will'' to South Koreans. Mr. Grayken also acknowledged that Steven Lee, the buyout firm's former South Korea manager, had embezzled ''millions of dollars,'' causing the firm to break tax rules. 
 ''We deeply regret this embarrassing and shameful episode,'' Mr. Grayken said, ''and to the Korean people and government, we apologize.'' 
 Mr. Lee, who quit Lone Star and left South Korea in September, was not available for comment. 
 But Mr. Grayken denied that Lone Star was involved in falsifying documents of Korea Exchange Bank to ease the $1.2 billion takeover of the bank in late 2003. 
 Lone Star is negotiating to sell Korea Exchange Bank to another South Korean lender, Kookmin Bank, for $6.6 billion. The firm's expected $4.4 billion gain has come to symbolize the large profits from such sales by foreign investment firm and has helped fuel negative public sentiment, particularly because Lone Star's transactions were done through subsidiaries in tax havens and did not entail paying taxes in South Korea. 
 The government, however, has promised to find a legal way to levy taxes on Lone Star's profit from its deal with Kookmin Bank. 
 Mr. Grayken said that in making its donation, Lone Star had no other motives besides showing its appreciation to the South Korean people. 
 But 20 people from Korea Exchange Bank disagreed. As Mr. Grayken walked out of the news conference, they chanted, ''Let's destroy foreign vulture funds.''

HEADLINE: A Glimmer of Hope in Iraq

 BODY:
Ibrahim al-Jaafari's agreement yesterday to step aside and let his Shiite bloc consider a new nominee for prime minister should finally break the stalemate that has been paralyzing Iraqi politics since last December's parliamentary election. 
 The most likely replacement nominees now being talked about are far from ideal. But the only conceivable path to a better future than civil war and chaos in Iraq is lined with distasteful compromise and leaps of faith. No one believes that success is certain.
A new prime minister will at least have a chance to make a fresh start and begin undoing some of the costly mistakes Mr. Jaafari has made since taking office last April. These include, most prominently, his willingness to allow sectarian militias, death squads and torturers to infiltrate the security services and his failure to insist on professional management of the oil industry and other essential economic sectors. Iraq's hopes for democracy, and even its existence as a single nation, could probably not have survived a second Jaafari term. 
 That is why the Jaafari nomination was subjected for weeks to a diplomatic full court press by the United States and Britain. What finally seems to have persuaded Mr. Jaafari to yield was not so much foreign jawboning, but the unforgiving arithmetic of Iraq's new Parliament. 
 To its credit, the main Kurdish party supported Sunni Arabs in refusing to vote for Mr. Jaafari in Parliament, thereby denying him the two-thirds support he would effectively need there to form a fully functioning government. That eventually caused even key Shiite allies to withdraw their support. But his critics' victory is only partial. The price of Mr. Jaafari's withdrawal seems to have been an understanding that his replacement will come from his own lackluster Dawa party, which, besides being fundamentalist and pro-Iranian, has formed a bloc with the most violence-prone and anti-American Shiite faction, led by Moktada al-Sadr. 
 No nominee sponsored by this Dawa-Sadr axis seems likely to be very enthusiastic about keeping militias out of the security services or cronies out of the key ministries. It will be up to the Kurdish and Sunni Arab parties that hold the balance of power in Parliament to insist on such steps as a condition for confirming a new government.
 That process now needs to move forward expeditiously. Iraqi voters who were forced to wait so long for democracy deserve to see its fruits. Much of last year was wasted under Mr. Jaafari's inept and blundering rule. The first four months of this year have been consumed in endless maneuvering over his bid for a second term. Meanwhile, sectarian tensions have risen, militias have entrenched their power, and public morale has plummeted. 
 A new start is desperately needed.

HEADLINE: Can Unused A-Plant Become a Princess?

BYLINE: By JESSICA KOWAL

DATELINE: ELMA, Wash. 

 BODY:
The stillborn Satsop nuclear plant, a product of cheap-power fantasies run amok here a quarter-century ago, stands ominously on a hill in this economically depressed corner of western Washington.
 Because local officials cannot afford to tear the plant down, they are trying to market their nuclear lemon as job-creating lemonade. Sometimes, though, even they sound doubtful.
''It takes a whole lot of elbow grease, funding and faith, I think, to believe there is something worth developing here,'' said Tami Garrow, chief executive of the public corporation that owns what is now optimistically called the Satsop Development Park. 
 A new marketing plan promotes the 440-acre site in the shadow of two reactors -- one nearly finished and the other a concrete shell -- as an ideal, if unusual, location for high-tech call centers, administrative offices, data storage and even manufacturing. 
 Supporters say the equipment once installed to serve an isolated nuclear plant, private sewers and abundant supplies of electricity and water are all perfect for businesses that seek security from natural disasters or terrorists. There has never been radioactivity because the plant was never in use. 
 The corporation that Ms. Garrow leads, the Grays Harbor Public Development Authority, took possession of the site in 1999 from the Bonneville Power Administration, a federal agency that markets electricity in the Northwest, and the former Washington Public Power Supply System, an agency often referred to as Whoops.
 The two Satsop reactors were among five that the Washington system began building in the late 1970's in the mistaken belief that regional economic growth would demand a huge increase in the supply of electricity. For a lucrative half-decade, the regional work force benefited from high-paying round-the-clock construction work. 
 But after spending billions of borrowed dollars, the public system collapsed and defaulted on $2.25 billion in municipal bonds. Electricity rates soared as utilities struggled to manage leftover debt. Four unfinished projects, including the two Satsop reactors, were mothballed by 1983 without ever producing a volt of power. The fifth reactor, in Richland, continues to operate. 
 Unlike the situation in much of the rest of the Northwest, where the economy is roaring back from recession years, this densely forested rain-soaked area at the base of the Olympic Peninsula desperately needs jobs. At 7.6 percent, the unemployment rate in Grays Harbor County in February was two percentage points higher than the statewide figure. 
 Scandinavian immigrants came to this area a century ago and built a vibrant logging industry. They cut the wood that helped rebuild San Francisco after the 1906 earthquake. 
 But logging has declined sharply since the 70's, hobbled by overseas competition and legal battles over the northern spotted owl. 
 A handful of mills still operate in towns near Elma, down from nearly 36 in the late 80's, said LeRoy Tipton, president of the Grays Harbor Chamber of Commerce. The Satsop plan offers some hope for replacing lost jobs, said Mr. Tipton, who calls the project ''our shining light on the hill.''
 The Grays Harbor development authority secured $15 million from the plant's former owners to modernize and beautify what it inherited, including two concrete cooling towers, each 496 feet tall. The authority planted trees and flowers, paved roads, built offices and installed fiber-optic lines.
 One cooling tower, which is functional, is available to industrial tenants. The inside of the other tower has been liberally sprinkled with grass seed, and there is talk of turning it into a public park. A cavernous steel dome, once intended to top a reactor building, has been splashed with orange paint and lent to girls' softball teams for indoor batting practice. 
 To empty the leftover knickknacks from the nuclear plant, an outside company is selling every generator, motor, crane, nut and bolt from the reactor and turbine buildings. On a recent day, workers with blowtorches in a dusty concrete-chilled building sliced steel pipe into scrap and cut down a 40-foot-high storage tank for emergency coolant. 
 The development park keeps 25 percent of gross receipts, $1.6 million so far. 
 ''We feel sort of like an organ donor,'' Ms. Garrow said.
 The reincarnation has had spotty success. Among the tenants, which employ 300 to 400 workers, are a call center, a boat builder, a door manufacturer, fire district administrators and companies that run voice and data services through the Satsop telecommunications lines.
 Other companies have come and gone. Boise Cascade, now known as OfficeMax, hired 70 people to manufacture home siding in a new factory, but closed it when the company shifted its focus to office products. A departed Internet security business left behind cubicles, desks, chairs and a palm-recognition entry system. 
 Few people seem to think that the windowless five-story reactor buildings with three-foot-thick walls will attract much interest, unless Hollywood comes calling. And many residents in the valley below the plant cannot envision it as anything other than wasteful excess. 
 At the Elma Airport Diner, where customers have a clear view of the cooling towers from outdoor picnic tables, Erin Hall, 42, a waitress, said she had been hired as a shredder operator at the Boise Cascade plant. 
 ''Nothing lasts up there,'' Ms. Hall said. 
 The diner's cook, Ron Ramey, 43, has found one way to put the plant to good use. When he hunts elk and deer in the woods, Mr. Ramey said, he watches the flashing red lights atop the cooling towers so he does not become lost. 
 ''It's like my Space Needle,'' he said.

HEADLINE: First Bank To Settle I.P.O. Suit

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH and JENNY ANDERSON

 BODY:
J. P. Morgan Chase said yesterday that it would pay $425 million to settle its part of a class-action lawsuit that contends dozens of banks cheated investors out of hundreds of millions of dollars from initial public offerings during the 1990's market boom.
 J. P. Morgan is the first to settle of the 55 investment banks named as defendants, and its agreement may prompt other Wall Street firms to follow. Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs are among the largest investment houses involved in the case. 
But with only a small fraction of the overall damages at stake, J. P. Morgan's eagerness to settle early may reflect the lessons learned last year from paying $2 billion, the most of any bank, as the last to resolve a class action stemming from the collapse of WorldCom.
 ''It's probably safe to say J. P. Morgan learned a lesson from the WorldCom settlement, which encouraged them to settle the I.P.O. litigation early on,'' said Robert G. Heim, a former enforcement lawyer for the Securities and Exchange Commission who now works for Meyers & Heim.
 The size of the settlement and the timing of yesterday's announcement seemed to catch some securities lawyers and other big banks by surprise, and it could set the stage for a multibillion-dollar total settlement.
 ''This will definitely put pressure on the remaining defendants to settle the litigation,'' Mr. Heim said. ''When the first settlement reached is so large, it sets the bar very high for future settlement.'' 
 Joseph Evangelisti, a J. P. Morgan spokesman, said yesterday that the bank had reached ''an agreement in principle'' but that it continued to deny the lawsuit's allegations. He added that there would also be no impact on future financial results because of adequate legal reserves. 
 The announcement was made after the stock market closed. Earlier, shares of J. P. Morgan slipped 2 cents, to $42.60. The agreement needs the approval of two federal judges.
 The deal is a badly needed victory for the New York law firm of Milberg Weiss Bershad & Schulman, which led a group of plaintiffs' lawyers. The firm and several partners have been the targets of a federal criminal investigation into allegations that illegal tactics were used in shareholder lawsuits.
 The lawsuit against the banks contends that during the technology bubble, the banks awarded shares of hot initial offerings to favored clients in return for lucrative investment banking business. It also contends that the banks made deals with investors so that they would buy shares in the aftermarket to drive up prices artificially and created misleading research to lure investors into buying.
 In 2001, Melvyn I. Weiss and other plaintiffs' lawyers originally sued, on behalf of hundreds of investors, the 55 banks as well as nearly 300 companies for practices related to the boom in initial offerings; another group of lawyers filed hundreds of similar complaints on antitrust charges.
 ''We are out to prove the tech bubble wasn't irrational exuberance, but the product of manipulative Wall Street firms,'' Mr. Weiss said in an interview yesterday. But when asked about possible settlements with the other banks, he said, ''We are not close.''
 Among the big investment banks that are have not resolved the litigation are Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, Lehman Brothers and Citigroup. 
 Officials at all of those firms declined to comment yesterday.
 For J. P. Morgan, the agreement brings with it the certainty of costs that eluded it last year after it waited to settle the WorldCom litigation. The bank has also moved quickly to resolve other legal cases over the last few months.
 The class action was not the first time allegations of misbehavior had surfaced concerning initial offerings. A number of the banks named have settled similar allegations with the S.E.C. Credit Suisse, whose technology franchise won it a coveted lead role in many of the hottest initial offerings, paid $100 million in January 2002 to settle charges that it received kickbacks from investors, in the form of inflated commissions, in exchange for doling out shares in initial offerings.
 In April 2003, 10 top Wall Street firms paid $1.4 billion to settle civil charges that they misled investors with research aimed at winning banking rather than educating investors.
 In late 2003, J. P. Morgan paid $25 million to settle charges that it violated Regulation M, a rule that essentially prohibits underwriters, during the quiet period before an offering, from bidding up shares, or inducing others to bid up shares in the offering aftermarket. Regulation M violations are not as serious as ''laddering,'' the practice of agreeing to buy shares at a set price in the aftermarket with the purpose of driving up the price.
 As is customary, the banks in those cases admitted no wrongdoing. But the 55 banks in the initial public offering case received two major setbacks.
 First, they tried to have the case dismissed and failed. Then, in early 2005, Judge Shira A. Scheindlin of the Federal District Court in Manhattan approved a $1 billion settlement between the nearly 300 companies and the investors who said they were defrauded. 
 If the investors recover more than $1 billion from the investment banks, the companies will have to pay nothing; if the amount is less than $1 billion they will pay the difference. 
 The companies agreed to cooperate with the investors' lawyers, leaving the banks as the main target.
 ''To the extent that we recover the money from the underwriters, most of it is credited against the $1 billion,'' Mr. Weiss said.
 This, he added, ''starts the ball rolling.''

Broadway

* 'AWAKE AND SING!' Dreams and disappointments, hopes and fears, encouraging words and bitter put-downs clash by day and night in Clifford Odets's turbulent comedy-drama about a Jewish family struggling to stay afloat in the 1930's. A gifted roster of performers -- including Mark Ruffalo, Lauren Ambrose, Zoe Wanamaker and Ben Gazzara -- manage to locate the dreaming centers of their characters, buried beneath layers of political sloganeering, everyday gripes or street slang. And even when the focus occasionally blurs in Bartlett Sher's ultimately moving revival, Odets's zesty dialogue, in which jazzy period colloquialisms are slung around like punches at a prize fight, is a joy to hear (2:30). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)

'BAREFOOT IN THE PARK' For a work that celebrates the liberating force of spontaneity, this revival of Neil Simon's 1963 comedy doesn't have one scene that feels organic, let alone impromptu. Directed by Scott Elliott, and starring Patrick Wilson and a miscast Amanda Peet as newlyweds in Greenwich Village, this ''Barefoot'' has the robotic gait of Frankenstein's monster (2:20). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)

* 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' The arrival of Jonathan Pryce and his eloquent eyebrows automatically makes this the season's most improved musical. With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'FESTEN' An intensely staged, indifferently acted production of David Eldridge's adaptation of a 1998 Danish film about a grim family reunion, which was a big hit in London under the same director, Rufus Norris. While the mise en scene remains unsettlingly stark, the Broadway cast (which includes Michael Hayden, Julianna Margulies, Jeremy Sisto and Ali MacGraw) registers the tension and testiness of people suffering from a collective bad hair day. Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

* 'THE PAJAMA GAME' Sexual chemistry in a Broadway musical? Isn't that illegal now? If it were, then Harry Connick Jr. and Kelli O'Hara -- the white-hot stars of Kathleen Marshall's delicious revival of this 1954 musical -- would be looking at long jail terms. This intoxicating production, which features a charming supporting cast led by Michael McKean, allows grown-up audiences the rare chance to witness a bona fide adult love affair translated into hummable songs and sprightly dance (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)

'RING OF FIRE' The man in black turns sunshine yellow in a show that strings songs associated with Johnny Cash into a big, bright candy necklace of a musical revue, created and directed by Richard Maltby Jr. In the current bio-flick ''Walk the Line,'' Cash wrestles demons; ''Ring of Fire'' wrestles with a really bad case of the cutes (2:00). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THREE DAYS OF RAIN' (2:30). In this revival of Richard Greenberg's slender, elegant drama of family disconnectedness, Julia Roberts is stiff with self-consciousness, glancingly acquainted with the two characters she plays and deeply, disturbingly beautiful. Otherwise, it is almost impossible to discern the virtues of the play itself in this wooden and splintered production, directed by Joe Mantello and also starring Paul Rudd and Bradley Cooper, who have little chance of capturing the audience's attention (2:30). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

* 'WELL' Lisa Kron's sparkling autobiographical play about illness, integration and her mother (portrayed with majestic warmth and weariness by Jayne Houdyshell) helps restore the honor of that tarnished literary form, the memoir. Though it shows the strain of scaling up for Broadway, this singular work, which stars Ms. Kron as herself, opens windows of insight and emotion found in no other show (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

Off Broadway

'BASED ON A TOTALLY TRUE STORY' A chatty, autobiographical comedy by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa about a writer for comic books who moonlights as a screenwriter and playwright. Juggling his two jobs, the busy writer begins backsliding in his unofficial third, ''being a loving, giving, emotionally available boyfriend.'' Minor-key angst ensues in this perky two hours of comic navel-gazing (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood)

'DEFIANCE' The second in John Patrick Shanley's cycle of morality plays that began with ''Doubt,'' this ambitious tale of racial relations and the military mindset on a North Carolina marine base feels both overcrowded and oddly diffuse. If ''Doubt'' has an elegant and energy-efficient sprinter's gait, ''Defiance'' progresses with a flustered air of distraction. The excellent Margaret Colin, as an officer's wife, provides a welcome shot of credibility (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, Theater 1, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley)

'ENTERTAINING MR. SLOANE' Miscasting is the mother of invention. Or so it proves to be for Jan Maxwell, who re-tailors an ill-fitting part and makes it as snug as a glove in this underpowered revival of Joe Orton's scandalous 1964 comedy. Scott Ellis's production of Orton's great farce of sexual hypocrisy, which also stars Alec Baldwin, is breezy, often funny and rarely convincing. (2:00). Laura Pels Theater at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)

'GEORGE M. COHAN TONIGHT!' The all-singing, all-dancing Jon Peterson summons the spirit of this legendary Broadway entertainer in this engaging one-man musical, devised and directed by Chip Deffaa (1:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (George Hunka)

'GREY GARDENS' As the socialite in limbo called ''Little'' Edie Beale, Christine Ebersole gives one of the most gorgeous performances ever to grace a musical. Unfortunately, she's a pearl of incalculable price in a show that is mostly costume jewelry. Adapted from the Maysles brothers' 1975 cult documentary movie, a camp favorite, and directed by Michael Greif, with the excellent Mary Louise Wilson as Edie's bedridden mother (2:40). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley)

'GUARDIANS' Peter Morris's play juxtaposes the moral decline of two disparate characters caught up in the destructive tailwinds of the American invasion of Iraq: a cold-blooded tabloid journalist in London and a soldier in the United States Army. Lee Pace and Katherine Moennig give persuasive performances as the sleazy hack and the scapegoated grunt, but Mr. Morris's play is more flashily provocative than truly thoughtful (1:30). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 253-9983. (Isherwood)

'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Rodney Hicks) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best. (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

* 'LANDSCAPE OF THE BODY' This terrific revival, directed by Michael Greif, identifies the unbearable wistfulness of being in John Guare's delirious heartbreaker of a comedy from 1977. The top-flight cast is led by Lili Taylor and Sherie Rene Scott as sisters -- one living, one a singing ghost -- who move in and out of a lyrical and sordid world where tabloid prurience has become a religion. Signature Theater's Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Brantley)

'MACRUNE'S GUEVARA' The Young Mirror arm of Mirror Repertory revives John Spurling's odd 1969 play about an artist who left behind a wall full of drawings of Che Guevara and the man who saw something profound in them. Parts of the play read today like a funny sendup of art critics who see too much brilliance in outsider-art gibberish; other parts seem a bit like gibberish of their own (2:15). St. Clement's, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger)

'RED LIGHT WINTER' A frank, occasionally graphic story of erotic fixation and the havoc it can wreak on sensitive types. Written and directed by Adam Rapp, this play is both a doomy romantic drama and a morbid comedy about the anxieties of male friendship. Although somewhat contrived, it features a lovely performance by Christopher Denham as a lonely soul starved for intimacy (2:25). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'A SAFE HARBOR FOR ELIZABETH BISHOP' The life of a great poet becomes the stuff of stale prose in this one-woman bio-play by Marta Goes, starring Amy Irving (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)

'SANDRA BERNHARD: EVERYTHING BAD AND BEAUTIFUL' Sandra Bernhard was a proverbial rock star long before headline-making folks in even the most prosaic walks of life were being referred to as such. Her new show, a collection of songs interspersed with musings on her life and on public figures ranging from Britney Spears to Condoleezza Rice, is casual to the point of being offhand. That said, it's invigorating to be in the presence of a true original (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, at Union Square, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'SHOW PEOPLE' Paul Weitz's eyebrow-pencil-thin comedy about a man who hires actors to impersonate his family feels like one long, occasionally amusing party game whose players don't know when to call it a night. The excellent four-member cast, led by Debra Monk and directed by Peter Askin, finds charm and energy amid the vaporous bait-and-switch plot reversals (2:00). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. (Isherwood)

* 'STUFF HAPPENS' Daniel Sullivan's sharp, invigorating production of David Hare's journalistic drama about the road to war in Iraq is conducted on the modest scale of a town-hall meeting. The characters (who have names like Bush and Blair) seem less like destiny-shaping gods than the ego trippers in your office. If that means they're too close for comfort, then ''Stuff Happens'' is doing its job (2:50). The Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* '[TITLE OF SHOW]' Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell are the authors, stars and subject matter of this delectable new musical about its own making. The self-consciousness is tempered by a wonderful cast performing with the innocence of kids cavorting in a sandbox. It's a worthy postmodern homage to classic backstage musicals, and an absolute must for show queens (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 353-0303. (Isherwood)

'TRYST' A suspense drama of a distinctly old-fashioned stamp about the romance between a handsome cad (Maxwell Caulfield) and a lonely spinster (Amelia Campbell). Will the wily predator seduce and abandon the mousy milliner? Karoline Leach's play springs a few twists that lack psychological credibility but keep the plot on the boil (2:00). Promenade Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

Off Off Broadway

'CHAMPION' and 'THE STUTTERING PREACHER' Two new one-act plays, one a well-drawn family drama and the other a brash and ribald romantic comedy, from the New Federal Theater and Black Spectrum Theater. Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, (212) 279-4200. (Hunka)

'LITTLE WILLY' A slickly produced and paper-thin character study of Hitler's nephew, who moved to Long Island before World War II (1:05). Ohio Theater, 66 Wooster Street, between Spring and Broome Streets, SoHo, (212) 279-4200. (Jason Zinoman)

'SCREWMACHINE/EYECANDY OR: HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE BIG BOB' David Calvitto is fun and scary as a television game-show host who turns sadistic, and Nancy Walsh and Bill Coelius are suitably airheaded as his contestants, but the play, by C. J. Hopkins, feels like a familiar comic skit that takes aim at an easy target (1:15). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Genzlinger)

Long-Running Shows

'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)

'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)

'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) John Patrick Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions in the clash between the head of a parochial school and the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 307-4100.(Lawrence Van Gelder)

'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

Last Chance

'FAHRENHEIT 451' A visceral version of Ray Bradbury's 1953 novel, staged by the Godlight Theater Company. No, firefighters don't burn books these days, but still you end up saying, ''Dang, that man had vision'' (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closing Sunday. (Genzlinger)

'MEN OF CLAY' In a play that Jeff Cohen, the author, says is based on his father, four Jewish men gather to play tennis in early-1970's Baltimore and watch their way of life disappear. The play seems to want to generate nostalgia, but since these four are racist, sexist pigs, it's hard to wish them anything but ill (2:15). June Havoc Theater, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 268-4444; closing Sunday.(Genzlinger)

'ON THE LINE' In a theater culture that is more likely to produce a play set in a well-heeled living room than on a factory floor, Joe Roland's unflinching portrait of a strike in New Jersey is a refreshing anomaly (1:30). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200; closing Sunday. (Zinoman)

'THE PRIVATE LIFE OF THE MASTER RACE' Bertolt Brecht's middle-period classic in a robust new translation by Binyamin Shalom and a spare and powerful production by the Roust Theater Company, directed by James Phillip Gates (2:45). Walkerspace, 46 Walker Street, between Church Street and Broadway, SoHo, (212) 868-4444; closing tomorrow. (Hunka)

Movies

Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.

'ATL' (PG-13, 103 minutes) A couple of rap stars make respectable starts on acting careers in this tale of black teenagers in Atlanta, despite a script marred by cliches and predictability. Tip Harris -- the rapper T. I. -- is intriguing as a young man who takes on the responsibility of raising his younger brother when their parents are killed, and Antwan Andre Patton -- Big Boi from OutKast -- makes a terrific drug lord. (Neil Genzlinger)

'BASIC INSTINCT 2' (R, 120 minutes) A joyless calculation, starring Sharon Stone and directed by Michael Caton-Jones, that is also a prime object lesson in the degradation that can face Hollywood actresses, especially those over 40. (Manohla Dargis)

* 'THE BEAUTY ACADEMY OF KABUL' (No rating, 74 minutes, in English and Dari) In the summer of 2004, a group of volunteer American hairstylists arrived in Kabul to open a school. In ''The Beauty Academy of Kabul,'' the director Liz Mermin documents the hilarious, moving and sometimes fractious meeting of diametrically different cultures, one having suffered unimaginable horrors and the other believing a good perm is the answer to everything. (Jeannette Catsoulis)

'CRASH' (Academy Award, Best Picture) (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collide, sometimes literally, within an extremely hectic 36 hours. Well intentioned, impressively acted but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism. (A. O. Scott)

* 'CURIOUS GEORGE' (G, 90 minutes) In a refreshing departure from the animal heroes of most recent children's movies, this Curious George doesn't rap, punch out bad guys or emit rapid-fire commentary on pop culture. George is all monkey -- a quality that will not only appeal to children, but also come as a great relief to parents who grew up with the classic stories by Margret and H. A. Rey. With top-drawer voice talent, including Will Ferrell, Drew Barrymore and Dick Van Dyke; original songs by Jack Johnson; and old-fashioned two-dimensional animation, ''Curious George'' is an unexpected delight. (Dana Stevens)

'DEVIL AND DANIEL JOHNSTON' (PG-13, 110 minutes) The romantic cliche that all artists are a little bit mad is put through its paces (if never seriously questioned) in this documentary about Daniel Johnston, a mentally ill songwriter whom Kurt Cobain, the lead singer for Nirvana, once called the greatest living. Jeff Feuerzeig, who won the best director award at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival, cobbles together a moving portrait of the artist as his own ghost, using a wealth of material provided by Mr. Johnston, from home movies to audiocassette diaries to dozens of original, and often heartbreakingly beautiful, songs. (Stevens)

* 'DON'T COME KNOCKING' (R, 122 minutes) The visually majestic but dramatically inert reunion of Sam Shepard (who stars) and the director Wim Wenders, 22 years after their auspicious collaboration on ''Paris, Texas,'' might be described as a magnificent ruin. (Stephen Holden)

* 'DRAWING RESTRAINT 9' (No rating, 135 minutes) Most of this stately film of few words, conceived and directed by the artist Matthew Barney, who stars with his wife, Bjork, takes place on a Japanese whaling ship afloat in Nagasaki Bay. Steeped not only in Japanese seafaring lore but also in centuries-old traditions of Japanese ritual, the film could be described as Mr. Barney's ''Moby-Dick.'' (Holden)

'ICE AGE: THE MELTDOWN' (PG, 93 minutes) Creative exhaustion haunts ''Ice Age: The Meltdown,'' as the characters from 2002's ''Ice Age'' face global warming and the submersion of their valley. While the animals head for safety in a giant, arklike boat, the director, Carlos Saldanha, indulges in biblical imagery and bad science. Over all, a flat and uninspired follow-up to a vastly superior movie. (Catsoulis)

* 'INSIDE MAN' (R, 128 minutes) The latest from Spike Lee takes a familiar setup -- in this case, a Wall Street bank heist that mutates into a hostage crisis -- and twists it ever so slightly and nicely. Among the film's most sustained pleasures are its holy trinity -- Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Jodie Foster -- and the best lineup of pusses and mugs outside ''The Sopranos.'' (Dargis)

'KINKY BOOTS' (PG-13, 106 minutes) In this silly, quasi-inspirational British comedy, a staid shoe factory in Northern England avoids ruin by switching from the manufacture of men's dress shoes to that of thigh-high, stiletto-heeled boots worn by drag queens. The recipe for this feel-good movie, which cries out to be made into a musical, comes from the same cookbook that gave us ''The Full Monty.'' (Holden)

'LA MUJER DE MI HERMANO' (R, 93 minutes, in Spanish) Zoe (Barbara Mori) is a gorgeous, vapid wife who longs for children, but her distant spouse (Christian Meier) makes love only on Saturdays. Enter the rebellious brother-in-law (Manolo Cardona), a smoldering artist whose schedule is less regimented. Bubbling with incest, adultery, religion and homosexuality, ''La Mujer de Mi Hermano'' is an overheated telenovela that considers procreation more important than honesty, and what we want more important than who we are. (Catsoulis)

* 'L'ENFANT (THE CHILD)' (R, 100 minutes, in French) The latest from the Belgian brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne involves a young thief (Jeremie Renier) who one day sells his newborn son for a fat envelope of cash. What interests the Dardennes -- what invests their work with such terrific urgency -- is not only how a man would sell a child as casually as a slab of beef, but also whether a man like this, having committed such a repellent offense, can find redemption. (Dargis)

'LOOK BOTH WAYS' (PG-13, 100 minutes) Written and directed by the Australian animator Sarah Watt, ''Look Both Ways'' follows a group of disparate and desperate characters over the course of one of the most depressing weekends in movie history. The principal sufferers are Meryl (Justine Clarke), a morbid illustrator, and Nick (William McInnes), a terminally ill photographer, who discover that a mutual fixation on catastrophe can be quite the aphrodisiac. Bogged down by stylistic gimmickry, ''Look Both Ways'' aims for existential drama but succeeds only in reminding us that misery loves company. (Catsoulis)

'LUCKY NUMBER SLEVIN' (R, 110 minutes) This star-studded jigsaw puzzle of revenge and mistaken identity thinks that it's terribly smart, although it amounts to an empty, self-satisfied imitation of ''Pulp Fiction'' that reputable actors like Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley can't salvage. (Holden)

* 'THE NOTORIOUS BETTIE PAGE' (R, 91 minutes) With the help of her charmingly enthusiastic star, Gretchen Mol, the director Mary Harron unwraps the great 1950's pinup queen Bettie Page, who for years was a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside a web of expertly tied rope. (Dargis)

'ON A CLEAR DAY' (PG-13, 99 minutes) Set in and around the dockyards of Glasgow, ''On a Clear Day'' follows Frank (the great Peter Mullan), a laid-off shipbuilder who decides to fix his life by swimming the English Channel. Despite a familiar crop of lovable eccentrics and a predictably inspirational thrust, the movie balances the sentimentality with excellent performances and a healthy dose of working-class vulnerability.(Catsoulis)

'SCARY MOVIE 4' (PG-13, 83 minutes) This parasitic franchise is back to feed on last year's disposable distractions, proving, if nothing else, that there's a laugh or two left in ''Brokeback Mountain'' parodies and Viagra overdoses. (Nathan Lee)

'SHE'S THE MAN' (PG-13, 105 minutes) ''Twelfth Night'' is recast as a hysterically peppy romantic comedy about a she-jock penetrating the boys' soccer team. Because girls can do anything boys can do, although their ultimate ambition is to put on a nice dress and go steady with a stupid jock. (Lee)

'SISTERS IN LAW' (No rating, 106 minutes, in English and pidgin) Grass-roots feminism thrives in a Cameroon village, thanks to the pair of warmhearted, tough-minded women of law profiled in this excellent verite documentary. (Lee)

* 'SLITHER' (R, 96 minutes) A horror film about an extraterrestrial monster with a hunger for flesh that slaloms from yucks to yuks, slip-sliding from horror to comedy and back again on its gore-slicked foundation. The writer and director James Gunn knows his icky, scary stuff. (Dargis)

'TAKE THE LEAD' (PG-13, 108 minutes) Hip-hop and ballroom dancing styles fuse in a South Bronx high school at which a dance teacher, Antonio Banderas, turns gawky ducklings into gliding swans. It's sloppy but mildly endearing. (Holden)

'Thank You for Smoking' (R, 92 minutes) The director Jason Reitman has made a glib and funny movie from Christopher Buckley's glib and funny novel about a Big Tobacco lobbyist, but the real attraction here is the hard-working star, Aaron Eckhart. (Dargis)

'Tsotsi' (R, 94 minutes) (Academy Award winner for best foreign film.) Written and directed by Gavin Hood, from a novel by Athol Fugard, this South African film centers on a 19-year-old thug who steals a baby and finds redemption. You don't have to read crystal balls to see into Tsotsi's future; you just need to have watched a couple of Hollywood chestnuts. (Dargis)

'V for Vendetta' (R, 131 minutes) James McTeigue directs this D-for-dumb future-shock story about a masked avenger (Hugo Weaving) and his pipsqueak sidekick (Natalie Portman) at war against a totalitarian British regime. (Dargis)

'THE WILD' (G, 94 minutes) Filled with softness and texture, ''The Wild'' follows Samson the lion (voiced by Kiefer Sutherland) as he escapes from the zoo to rescue his cub, who has stowed away on a ship bound for Africa. With inspired voice work from Eddie Izzard as a pukka koala and William Shatner as a menacing wildebeest, the movie also finds time to explore the travails of single fatherhood and the evils of oppression. (Catsoulis)

Film Series

COMEDY FORTNIGHT (Through Wednesday) The Two Boots Pioneer Theater's festival offers nightly screenings of ''Blackballed: The Bobby Dukes Story,'' starring Rob Corddry of ''The Daily Show'' as a disgraced paintball champion, and two more ''Best of First Sundays: A Hilarious Retrospective'' programs of film shorts.

BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; $10. (Gates)

Pop

Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.

THE ATARIS (Tuesday) The Ataris play pop-punk at its most suburban and apple-cheeked. They have been around since 1997, but their concerns haven't evolved much beyond those of the harmless skateboard rats next door. 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $15. (Laura Sinagra)

JOE BATAAN (Tonight) Since the 1970's, this keyboardist has been playing Latin soul that mixes mambo and jazzy R & B. 9, BAMcafe, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn; no cover. (Sinagra)

DAN BERN, KAKI KING (Tomorrow) Dan Bern is a wry singer-songwriter. Like Loudon Wainwright III, he puts his bitterness in the foreground, usually in the service of a pointed joke with a lefty edge. Kaki King is a multifaceted guitarist whose style is grounded in driving yet intricate rhythms. 8:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. (Sold out.) (Sinagra)

BLACK EYED PEAS, FLIPSYDE, PUSSYCAT DOLLS (Tonight) The Black Eyed Peas make lightweight hip-hop that revolves around the brash sexiness of the singer Fergie. Flipsyde is a socially conscious rap crew that incorporates some alt-rock. The Pussycat Dolls, a burlesque crew turned hit dance-pop act, make enticingly sassy boasts about their man-stealing skills. 7:30, Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $39.50 to $54.50. (Sinagra)

MARSHALL CHAPMAN, JENNY SCHEINMAN (Tonight) The songwriter Marshall Chapman has been at it since 1973, and her songs, from ''Betty's Bein' Bad'' to ''Last Mango in Paris'' have been recorded by the likes of Crystal Gayle and Jimmy Buffet. The violinist Jenny Scheinman leads a combo with the guitarist Bill Frisell and the bassist and guitarist Tony Scherr. 7:30, Housing Works Used Book Cafe, 126 Crosby Street, near Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 334-3324; $20. (Sinagra)

CHIMAIRA, GOD FORBID (Wednesday) The hard-core metal band Chimaira mixes macabre themes with Greek mythology. God Forbid offers waves of apocalyptic thrash. 6 p.m., Avalon, 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 777-6800 or ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $20. (Sinagra)

THE DRESDEN DOLLS (Tomorrow) Combining bash and chatter with Weimar-style cabaret, the singer and pianist Amanda Palmer and the drummer Brian Viglione play feisty call-and-response punk. Doors open at 6 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600, $25. (Sinagra)

ELECTRIC SIX (Tuesday and Wednesday) Three years ago this Detroit garage band generated buzz with the smirking but rocking song ''Danger! High Voltage.'' Its latest album, ''Senor Smoke'' (Warner), never achieves dance-punk command, but the histrionic singer Dick Valentine and his boys know how to be manic. Tuesday at 9 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $12. Wednesday at 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $10. (Sinagra)

BANNING EYRE WITH COUMBA SIDIBE (Tomorrow) The playing of the guitarist, author and African-music scholar Banning Eyre takes its cues from the fluid, nimble style of the West African guitarists who populate his CD ''In Griot Time.'' Tomorrow he will be joined by the deep-voiced Malian singer Coumba Sidibe and will play as part of her backing combo. 8 p.m., Barbes, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; $10. (Sinagra)

BELA FLECK & THE FLECKTONES (Tonight) Bela Fleck, a banjoist, has moved far beyond bluegrass technique. His own tunes feature odd meters and tricky structures, though his band can make them sound briskly mechanical. He has also applied his technique to the classical repertory for one more kind of crossover. 11:30, B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $35. (Jon Pareles)

KIRK FRANKLIN (Tomorrow) Kirk Franklin is a preacher, not a singer, but that hasn't kept him from selling millions of albums. He leads a troupe that meshes P-Funk grooves with messages of uplift, putting hip-hop rhythms behind the old-fashioned gospel dynamics of wide-open belting and jubilant choir singing, updating the music without sacrificing it to slickness. 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212) 632-4000; $37 to $65. (Pareles)

GHAZAL (Tuesday) Kayhan Kalhor, who plays a spike fiddle, and Shujaat Husain Khan, who plays sitar, weave classical Persian and Indian styles into improvisatory jams.

GHOSTFACE KILLAH, DJ PREMIER, SLICK RICK (Tomorrow) There is lots of rapping lately about drugs and dealing, but the Wu Tang Clan alum Ghostface Killah brings a particular pathos to the rap game on his new ''Fishscale'' (Def Jam), cutting pure thrill with whiffs of regret. He is joined on the bill by the jazzy DJ Premier and the smooth storyteller Slick Rick. 7 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $33. (Sinagra)

GUSTER (Tonight) Guster, a band from Boston, has followed the Dave Matthews Band's playbook for building an audience: touring constantly and singing unabashedly earnest folk-rock songs about the painful uncertainties of friendship, love and growing up. 7, Hiro Ballroom, 366 West 17th Street, Chelsea, ticketweb.com or (866) 468-7619. (Sold out.) (Pareles)

SEU JORGE (Thursday) This Brazilian singer may be best known here for his lilting samba covers of David Bowie songs in the movie ''The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou'' and his role as Knockout Ned in ''City of God.'' His music avoids the traditional Brazilian styles, favoring crowd-pleasing funk-pop and loverman R & B. 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan; (212) 777-6800; $25 in advance, $30 at the door. (Sinagra)

HUGH MASEKELA (Tuesday) The South African flugelhornist Hugh Masekela has more to offer than his international hit ''Grazing in the Grass.'' For decades, he has brought together the three-chord lope of South African pop with the zigzagging possibilities of jazz. 8 and 10:30 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940; $25 in advance, $30 at the door. (Pareles)

VAN MORRISON (Monday) Van Morrison has flirted with country music before, but his latest album, ''Pay the Devil'' (Lost Highway), offers his slanted take on songs like Hank Williams's ''Your Cheatin' Heart'' and Rodney Crowell's ''Till I Gain Control Again.'' He's better at his own classic, agitated R & B but can certainly work up a surly-cowboy pique. 7:30 p.m., Theater at Madison Square Garden, 3 (212) 307-7171; $79.50 and $149.50.(Sinagra)

NOUVELLE VAGUE (Tonight) These French multi-instrumentalists have hit upon a lucrative shtick, covering jittery post-punk gems like Joy Division's dark, swirling ''Love Will Tear Us Apart'' as bossa nova chill-out music. 9, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $20. (Sinagra)

SCISSOR SISTERS (Tomorrow and Sunday) These performance-artist glam rockers have both a healthy sense of irony and pop chops. Their exuberant ''Take Your Mama Out'' gained them a mainstream following. Tomorrow at 10 p.m., Sunday at 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. (Sold out.) (Sinagra)

SECRET MACHINES (Wednesday) This psych-rock act harks back to both Led Zeppelin-style pummel and the ragtag explorations of the Flaming Lips, prizing epic live sound as much as headphone spaciousness. 9 p.m., Hiro Ballroom, 363 West 16th Street, Chelsea, ticketweb.com or (866) 468-7619. (Sold out.) (Sinagra)

SUPERSUCKERS (Thursday) The Supersuckers play amiable Satanist speed-metal patterned on Motorhead's ''Ace of Spades.'' 7 p.m., Avalon, 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 777-6800 or ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $16.50. (Sinagra)

TAKING BACK SUNDAY (Tuesday) These Long Island screamo boys shout their romantic confessions over punk rock that's tinged with radio-friendly metal. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $25. (Sinagra)

BEN TAYLOR (Tomorrow) The son of James Taylor and Carly Simon, Ben Taylor has his dad's voice, his mom's kookiness and his own Northeastern hippie affect. 10:45 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $13 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sinagra)

TOOTS & THE MAYTALS (Tonight) Toots Hibbert was the first Jamaican singer to put the term reggae in a song title; his ''Do the Reggay'' came out in 1968, when the rhythm was brand-new. He is reggae's long-running soul man, applying the gruff, gospel exuberance of Otis Redding to tales of prison, love, dancing and redemption. 8 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $27.50. (Pareles)

ALLEN TOUSSAINT (Sunday) This legendary New Orleans songwriter, producer and pianist has spent the months since Hurricane Katrina performing largely for the benefit of the continuing relief efforts in the Crescent City. Noon, Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $30. (Sinagra)

JOHN VANDERSLICE (Thursday) A collaborator of the Mountain Goats' clever songsmith John Darnielle, the strummy singer-songwriter Mr. Vanderslice also writes his own ruminative, though less clever songs. 10 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $12. (Sinagra)

VIKKU' VINAYAKRAM'S SAPTHAAKSHARA (Wednesday) The percussionist T. H. Vinayakram, known as Vikku, has made his name accompanying other Indian artists on the ghatam (clay pot), as well as working with John McLaughlin and Zakir Hussain in the group Shakti. He is joined here by an ensemble that includes his three sons for a program of South Indian drumming. 10 p.m., Allen Room, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 258-9958; $35. (Sinagra)

Cabaret

Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.

* KAREN AKERS (Tonight and tomorrow, and Tuesday through Thursday) The regal cabaret singer and the brassy songs of Kander and Ebb that she is offering in her new show may not be an obvious fit. But Ms. Akers locates the heart inside the brass and sass. 9 p.m., with additional shows tonight and tomorrow night at 11:30, Algonquin Hotel, Oak Room, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; cover, $60, with a $20 minimum; $60 prix fixe dinner required on Thursdays and at the early shows tonight and tomorrow. (Stephen Holden)

BARBARA CARROLL (Sunday) Even when swinging out, this Lady of a Thousand Songs remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. 2 p.m., Algonquin Hotel, Oak Room, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; $55, including brunch at noon. (Holden)

BLOSSOM DEARIE (Tomorrow and Sunday) To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. The songs date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit. Tomorrow at 7 p.m., Sunday at 6:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $15 minimum, or $54.50 for a dinner-and-show package. (Holden)

BABY JANE DEXTER (Tonight) This booming pop-blues contralto may not be demure, but she is tasteful in a smart, regal, big-mama way, and she is astute in her choices of often obscure soul, blues and jazz songs that play to her contradictory mixture of the lusty and the philosophical. 7 p.m., Helen's, 169 Eighth Avenue, near 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-0609; $20, with a $15 minimum. (Holden)

* MARY CLEERE HARAN (Tonight and tomorrow, and Tuesday through Thursday) A wonderful no-frills singer with a sophisticated wit, Ms. Haran has a remarkable talent for simultaneously interpreting standards in the spirit in which they were written and looking at them through 21st-century eyes. 8:45 p.m., with additional shows tonight and tomorrow night at 10:45, Cafe Carlyle, at the Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600; $60 tonight and tomorrow; $50 Tuesday through Thursday.

ANNIE ROSS (Wednesday) Cool, funny, swinging and indestructible, this 75-year-old singer and sometime actress exemplifies old-time hip in its most generous incarnation. 9:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $12 minimum. (Holden)

Jazz

Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.

* AFRO-LATIN JAZZ ORCHESTRA AND BALLET HISPANICO (Tonight and tomorrow night) ''Palladium Nights,'' a new ballet choreographed by Willie Rosario, aims to recreate the electricity of that legendary ballroom during mambo's 1950's heyday. A similar time warp occurs every time the Afro-Latin Jazz Orchestra performs Chico O'Farrill's ''Afro-Cuban Suite,'' as it plans to do here. 8, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 721-6500; $30 to $130. (Nate Chinen)

(Chinen)

JOAO BOSCO (Tuesday through April 30) Known in his early career as a hit-making songwriter for the Brazilian songbird Elis Regina, Mr. Bosco has been a popular singer on his own merits for some 20 years.

(Chinen)

MICHEL CAMILO TRIO (Tuesday through April 30) A percussive, often cathartic pianist, Mr. Camilo recently released a recording of Gershwin's ''Rhapsody in Blue'' (Telarc) with a 95-piece symphony orchestra. His trio, with the bassist Charles Flores and the drummer Dafnis Prieto, can sometimes seem nearly as expansive. 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $35 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum.

(Chinen)

BILL FRISELL QUINTET (Through Sunday, and Tuesday through April 30) On his latest Nonesuch releases -- ''East/West'' and ''Further East/Further West,'' both partly recorded at the Village Vanguard -- the guitarist Bill Frisell conjures a compelling hallucination of the American popular songbook, with Tony Scherr and Kenny Wollesen on bass and drums. The addition of the saxophonist Greg Tardy and the trumpeter Ron Miles alters the ensemble's chemistry as well as its size. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $20; $25 on Fridays and Saturdays; with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

MONCEF GENOUD (Tonight) Tunisian-born, Swiss-raised and blind from birth, Mr. Genoud applies an uncommon perspective to his acoustic piano playing, as he demonstrates on a strong new album, ''Aqua'' (Savoy). He performs here with a trio, his most comfortable setting. 8, 10 and midnight, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

ROBIN HOLCOMB (Tomorrow) Ms. Holcomb seeks out meditative spaces as both a pianist and a singer, and she softens her experimental urges with an enveloping sort of lyricism. For this rare unaccompanied performance, she revisits old pieces and introduces some new ones. 8:30 p.m., Location One, 20 Greene Street, between Canal and Grand Streets, SoHo, (212) 219-8242; cover, $15. (Chinen)

DAVE KIKOSKI QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) A well-rounded pianist in the modern mainstream, Mr. Kikoski often does his best work as an accompanist, which is only one reason to applaud this group's inclusion of the tenor saxophonist Seamus Blake. 8 and 9:45, Kitano Hotel, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, (212) 885-7119; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

PAT MARTINO QUINTET (Through Sunday) The guitarist Pat Martino's new Blue Note album, ''Remember: A Tribute to Wes Montgomery,'' does exactly what it purports to do. And it works, because of the untroubled self-assurance of the emulation and the simple satisfaction of a hard-swinging band. 8 and 10 p.m., with an 11:30 show tonight and tomorrow night, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum.

RENE McLEAN (Tonight) Mr. McLean, a saxophonist, leads an acoustic quartet in memory of his father, the alto saxophone legend Jackie McLean, who died three weeks ago. 7, Rubin Museum of Art, 150 West 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 620-5000, ext. 344, www.rmanyc.org; $20. (Chinen)

MYRA MELFORD (Tonight) Ms. Melford's solo piano playing is a study in subtle coloration and shifting grain, but it can also deliver the solid punch of the blues. 8:30 p.m., Location One, 20 Greene Street, between Canal and Grand Streets, SoHo, (212) 219-8242; cover, $15. (Chinen)

FRANK MORGAN QUARTET (Through Sunday) Now in his 70's, the alto saxophonist Frank Morgan is one of the last survivors of the bebop era (and in his case, survivor is truly the appropriate term). He leads a sympathetic group consisting of John Hicks on piano, Curtis Lundy on bass and Victor Lewis on drums. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen)

MY EARS ARE BENT (Tuesday) This three-piece band, consisting of Ted Reichman on acoustic piano and electronics, Mary Halvorson on guitar and Ben Perowsky on drums, fashions an engrossingly layered chamber-music aesthetic that suggests more than a passing interest in independent rock. 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, www.thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)

ROY NATHANSON (Wednesday) ''Sotto Voce'' (Aum Fidelity), the new recording by the saxophonist Roy Nathanson, makes full use of his unusual skills as a conceptualist and raconteur. All the members of his band double on vocals, occasionally suggesting a literate and subversive barbershop quartet; one of them, Napoleon Maddox, provides the beat-box percussion that hustles the music along. 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; cover, $15, with a two-drink minimum. (Chinen)

JENNY SCHEINMAN (Tonight and Tuesday) Ms. Scheinman is that rare jazz violinist who embraces her instrument's folksier side without making concessions to genre. Tonight she plays and sings in a group featuring Bill Frisell and Tony Scherr on guitars, and Peter Scherr on bass, as part of the ''Live From Home'' series at the Housing Works Bookstore; on Tuesday she plays with yet another guitarist, Adam Levy, along with the pianist Art Hirahara and the bassist Matt Penman. Tonight at 7:30, Housing Works Bookstore, 126 Crosby Street, between Houston and Prince Streets, SoHo, (212) 334-3324, www.housingworks.org/usedbookcafe; cover, $20. Tuesday at 7 p.m., Barbes, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8. (Chinen)

SIMONE: A TRIBUTE TO NINA SIMONE (Tonight) An intensely personal tribute on the third anniversary of Nina Simone's death, featuring her daughter, the accomplished Broadway actress known simply as Simone, and her closest musical partner, the guitarist Al Shackman. The setting is Town Hall, site of a pivotal concert in her early career. 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824; $32.50 and $37.50.(Chinen)

TIERNEY SUTTON /LOSTON HARRIS (Thursday through April 29) Ms. Sutton's clear, sweetly sonorous voice isn't inherently a jazz timbre, but she is irrefutably a jazz singer, as she has demonstrated on a number of recent engagements. She shares a bill with Mr. Harris, a singer and pianist with a style patterned after Nat King Cole. 7:30 p.m., Allen Room, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 721-6500; $40 to $130. (Chinen)

TERRASSON-OKEGWO-PARKER TRIO (Tuesday through April 30) Throughout the latter half of the 1990's, the pianist Jacky Terrasson led one of jazz's fresher-sounding acoustic piano trios, distinguished not only by his fluid pianism but also by the resonant bass tone of Ugonna Okegwo and the pared-down percussive drive of Leon Parker. Regrouping here, the musicians present themselves as a collective, which could well have positive implications for the music. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with additional 11:30 shows next Friday and April 29, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $25; $30 next Friday and April 29. (Chinen)

CHARLES TOLLIVER'S MUSIC INC. CONTINUUM (Tomorrow) In the 1970's, Music Inc. was a heavy-gauge quartet designed to showcase the exertions of a blazing young trumpeter named Charles Tolliver. This reincarnation features Mr. Tolliver, whose recent re-emergence has been a welcome bit of news, and Cecil McBee, his original bassist; the continuum comes in the form of two youngbloods, the pianist Robert Glasper and the drummer E. J. Strickland. 9 and 10:30 p.m., Sista's Place, 456 Nostrand Avenue, at Jefferson Avenue, Brooklyn, (718) 398-1766 ; cover, $20. (Chinen)

* RANDY WESTON AND THE GNAWA MASTER MUSICIANS OF MOROCCO (Tuesday) Mr. Weston, the leading practitioner of a distinctly African approach to jazz piano, has a history of serious collaboration with the Gnawa Master Musicians of Morocco. This free concert aims to capture the fire of a performance in Mr. Weston's native Brooklyn seven years ago, which has been issued on CD as ''Spirit! The Power of Music'' (Sunnyside). 7 p.m., World Financial Center Winter Garden, 220 Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 945-0505; free. (Chinen)

Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.

 Opera

'LA BOHEME' (Sunday) James Robinson's City Opera production punts the Puccini favorite forward by some 80 years, placing the action in the opening months of World War I and lending an extra tug of pathos. Yunah Lee sings Mimi, Eric Fennell steps in as Rodolfo, Jennifer Black is Musetta, and Philip Torre sings Marcello. David Wroe conducts. 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; sold out. (Jeremy Eichler)

'CARMEN' (Tomorrow) On opening night at the New York City Opera, Kate Aldrich came through in the title role, capturing not only Carmen's devilish seductiveness but also her radical protofeminist pride in her own independence. Unfortunately, there was scant chemistry between her and Robert Breault as Don Jose. 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; sold out. (Eichler)

'DON GIOVANNI' (Tonight) The second cast will offer the season's final performance of Mozart's nearly perfect opera at City Opera. Timothy Kuhn, new to the company this season, sings the title role; also making a debut on this stage is Claudia Waite, as Donna Anna. 8, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; sold out. (Anne Midgette).

* 'DON PASQUALE' (Tonight and Tuesday) The veteran Austrian director Otto Schenk, who is also an acclaimed comic actor in his homeland, understands that the way to make a rich comic opera like Donizetti's ''Don Pasquale'' work is to treat it seriously. In his wonderful new production for the Met he accomplished this vividly. The cast is splendid, especially the charismatic soprano Anna Netrebko, the dynamic young baritone Mariusz Kwiecien and, in the title role, the stylish Italian bass Simone Alaimo. Tonight at 8, Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $205 tickets remaining tonight, $175 on Tuesday. (Anthony Tommasini)

'LOHENGRIN' (Monday) While Wagner's sprawling opera is playing at the Met, the Alliance Players offer the New York premiere of ''Lohengrin'' by the Italian avant-gardist Salvatore Sciarrino. This one-act opera is entirely introspective, based on what the composer calls the ''invisible action'' unfolding inside Elsa's mind. In his music, Mr. Sciarrino often paints with the finest of brushes, hinting at deep emotion through compressed whispers and the rustling of wind. For adventurous listeners, his interiorized postscript to Wagner promises to be fascinating. 8 p.m., Florence Gould Hall, 55 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100; $35. (Eichler)

'MISS LONELYHEARTS' (Wednesday) Juilliard has done much commissioning to celebrate its centennial this year, including a new opera that's been in progress for some time. Lowell Liebermann's piece is based on Nathanael West's novella, with a libretto by J. D. McClatchy, who has written or helped write librettos for significant works -- Tobias Picker's ''Emmeline,'' Lorin Maazel's ''1984,'' Ned Rorem's ''Our Town'' and Elliot Goldenthal's ''Grendel'' (opening at the Los Angeles Opera next month). Andreas Delfs conducts. 8 p.m., Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 155 West 65th Street, Manhattan, (212) 769-7406; $20, $10 for students and 65+. (Midgette).

* 'LE NOZZE DI FIGARO' (Tomorrow and Thursday) After five months' absence, Jonathan Miller's handsome production has returned to the line-up at the Met with an almost entirely new cast. The soprano Andrea Rost and the bass-baritone John Relyea are endearing as Susanna and Figaro. And the mezzo-soprano Alice Coote, in her first appearances at the Met, has been winning praise for her rich-voiced portrayal of the hormonal page boy Cherubino. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $220 remaining tomorrow, $26 to $175 on Thursday. (Tommasini)

'SUSANNAH' (Tonight through Sunday) It's easy to poke fun at Carlisle Floyd's opera for its folksy score, run through with hymn tunes, square dances and Appalachian ditties. Yet the opera, more sophisticated than it appears, about a sensual young woman in rural Tennessee who inadvertently stirs up envy and desire among the townspeople, has been moving audiences since its premiere in 1956. The Dicapo Opera Theater presents a 50th-anniversary production, directed by Michael Capasso and conducted by Steven Osgood. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 4 p.m., 184 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-9438 ext. 10; $47.50. (Tommasini)

'TOSCA' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) Floria Tosca, opera's quintessential diva, is not a role for the fainthearted. Deborah Voigt, still searching for the perfect fit, role-wise, for her silvery voice, is taking it on at the Met for the first time. Franco Farina and James Morris can match her volume-wise if not with stylistic elegance. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; sold out tomorrow, $175 tickets remaining on Wednesday. (Midgette)

Classical Music

ALEXANDER STRING QUARTET (Tuesday and Wednesday) With lots of Beethoven under its collective belt, this San Francisco-based ensemble is no stranger to marathon performance cycles, and this coming week, it begins another lightning traversal, this time of Shostakovich's 15 string quartets. Tuesday's performance features Nos. 1, 2 and 3; Wednesday brings Nos. 4, 5 and 6. The five-concert series runs through May 1. 8 p.m., Baruch College Performing Arts Center, 55 Lexington Avenue, at 25th Street, (646) 312-4085; $25. (Eichler)

AXIOM (Tonight) Jeffrey Milarsky conducts this newly hatched new-music chamber ensemble in Takemitsu's ''Tree Line,'' Birtwistle's ''Tragoedia,'' Webern's ''Konzert'' (Op. 24) and Steve Reich's ''City Life.'' 8, Studio 309, Juilliard School, 60 Lincoln Center Plaza, (212) 769-7406; free. (Allan Kozinn)

OLGA BORODINA and ILDAR ABDRAZAKOV (Tuesday) The creamy-voiced, languid Russian mezzo-soprano Olga Borodina is one of the best we have today, although her gifts as a recitalist are mixed; the voice is beautiful, the presentation has been somewhat passive. Her husband, a bass, joins her for a program of Russian music, including songs and arias by Glinka, Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninoff, Rimsky-Korsakov, Borodin and others. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $24 to $85. (Midgette)

BROOKLYN PHILHARMONIC (Tomorrow) Michael Christie, this orchestra's new music director, leads his charges in a program of symphonic pieces and songs celebrating contemporary urbanity, with the German cabaret star Ute Lemper as his soloist. Mr. Christie offers classic works by Bernstein, Gershwin, Copland, Eisler and Piazzolla, as well as more recent pieces by Heiner Goebbels, Kander and Ebb, and Chava Alberstein and Ms. Lemper's ''Ghosts of Berlin.'' 8 p.m., Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100; $20 to $60; $10 for students. (Kozinn)

CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER (Sunday and Tuesday) ''Discoveries and Masterworks'' is the name of this two-part program that combines staples of the repertory with less-known works. Sunday's program juxtaposes Schoenberg and Brahms, Kurtag and Schumann; Tuesday's, Brahms's Piano Quartet in G minor with Chausson and Boccherini. Sunday at 5, Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5788; $28 to $49. (Midgette)

* EMERSON STRING QUARTET (Thursday) Among the great composers of the 20th century, Shostakovich was the most inscrutable. But in his 15 string quartets he came closest to showing his hand. These works are like entries in a diary, and he never imagined that they would become as popular as they are today. The Emerson Quartet plays these seminal works compellingly and has recorded them complete. The quartet will perform them all, in chronological order, on five programs starting on Thursday. 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $60. (Tommasini)

* MIDORI (Tuesday) Is Midori maturing into an adventurous performer? Her hefty contemporary program -- Judith Weir's ''Music for 247 Strings,'' Isang Yun's Violin Sonata, Lutoslawski's Partita and works by Gyorgy Kurtag and Alexander Goehr -- suggests a willingness to leave the instant crowd pleasers behind and take some chances. Her longtime accompanist, Robert McDonald, is at the piano. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $48 to $54. (Kozinn)

* NEW JUILLIARD ENSEMBLE (Monday) Joel Sachs leads his expert student ensemble in their final concert of season. The program, like many of Mr. Sachs's adventures, is international and far-flung, with works by Andrew Ford, from Australia; Ryan Francis, from the United States; Bernd Franke, from Germany; Jose Maceda, from the Philippines; and Milica Paranosic, from the former Yugoslavia. 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 769-7406; free, but tickets are required. (Kozinn)

* NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Today and tomorrow) Mstislav Rostropovich approaches the music of Shostakovich with more authority and close personal knowledge than just about anyone. He returns to the Philharmonic to lead the composer's 10th Symphony and his gripping First Violin Concerto, with Maxim Vengerov as soloist. Today at 2 p.m., tomorrow at 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $33 to $104. (Eichler)

'POCKET CONCERTOS' (Tomorrow) It's one thing to commission a new concerto; it's another to commission 12 of them. This weekend, Miller Theater introduces the first concert in a three-year project conceived to create works for soloists and sinfonietta by some of the theater's favorite composers. Two of the concertos on this first program are for piano -- John Musto will perform his own, and Ichizo Okashiro's will be played by his sister, Chitose -- one is for accordion, by Julia Wolfe; and Benedict Mason has written a double concerto for bass and tuba. George Steel, who runs the theater and conceived the project, conducts. 8 p.m., Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799; $25. (Midgette)

CHARLES ROSEN (Sunday) Not many pianists can give their own preconcert lecture with the erudition that Charles Rosen will very likely muster as he concludes his series on ''Mozart Within History.'' The theme of this third installment is Mozart's influence on later generations of Romantic composers. The talk begins at 1:30 p.m., followed by the recital at 3 p.m., with works by Mozart, Schubert, Chopin and Liszt. Fred Sherry (cello) and David Bowlin (violin) join along the way. 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500; $35. (Eichler)

* VOICES OF ASCENSION (Wednesday) This superb church choir, led by Dennis Keene, goes ecumenical in a program devoted to Hebrew sacred settings, namely Bernstein's ''Chichester Psalms'' and Ernest Bloch's ''Avodath Hakodesh,'' a setting of the Sabbath morning service. 8 p.m., Church of the Ascension, Fifth Avenue at 10th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 358-1469; $10 to $45. (Kozinn)

More details: marthagraham.org. (John Rockwell)

HEDWIG DANCES (Thursday) From Chicago, this august modern-dance troupe will perform work by Jan Bartoszek (the company's artistic director), Jan Eckert and Maray Gutierrez that has been inspired by themes ranging from Goya's ''Caprichos'' to the intimate rules of the bath. (Through April 30.) 8 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, between Houston and Prince Streets, (212) 334-7479; $18; $15 for students and 65+. (Dunning)

(Through April 30.) 8:30 p.m., Danspace Project, St, Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194 or www.danspaceproject.org; $15. (Jack Anderson)

Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.

 Museums

* American Folk Art Museum: 'WHITE ON WHITE (AND A LITTLE GRAY): FEMALE RESPONSES TO THE CLASSICAL IDEAL IN AMERICAN DECORATIVE ARTS,' through Sept. 17. The importance of neo-Classicism to early American architecture, silver and fine furniture is not exactly news. This small, beautiful show follows its spread into more personal corners of visual culture: often exquisite, strikingly dimensional white-work bedcovers; luminously grisaille, sometimes wacky marble-dust drawings; and print-work embroidery mourning pictures. Few exhibitions this size (35 pieces) present quite such a vivid and rewarding picture of artistic assimilation and transformation. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith)

* BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 13. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and cast-off clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to, and settlement in, the United States, from early times to the present, in a garrulous, very personal way. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000. (Grace Glueck)

* Brooklyn Museum: WILLIAM WEGMAN: 'FUNNEY/STRANGE,' through May 28. Descended from Marcel Duchamp and Buster Keaton, Mr. Wegman has straddled high and low for more than three decades, using his signature Weimaraners to make the art world's funniest videos, as well as television commercials, calendars and children's books. His popular success has tended to obscure his originality and influence, along with a multifarious production that includes wittily captioned drawings, wonderfully irreverent paintings and a host of nondog photographic work. This thorough and thoroughly entertaining retrospective highlights not only the accessibility of his richly human art, but also its dedication to the 1970's notion that art should not look like art. (See above.) (Smith)

* FRICK COLLECTION: 'GOYA's LAST WORKS,' through May 14. This compact show is sublime. The most humane portraits are mixed with sketches, like diary entries, in which society is an irredeemable mob of lunatics and murderers. In exile in Bordeaux, Goya spent his last days in physical misery, lamenting man's essential evil while experimenting with the new medium of lithography and inventing the most exquisite, luminous paintings on tiny chips of ivory. Like the late works of Titian or Rembrandt, Goya's late works achieve a whole new level of freedom and depth, haunted by death but exalted. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Michael Kimmelman)

* Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum: 'David Smith: A Centennial,' through May 14. David Smith is best known for his worst work, bulky sculptures of the ''important'' kind that museums and banks like to buy. Much (though not all) of that material has been excised from this survey in favor of smaller, earlier, nonmonumental pieces that the curator, Carmen Gimenez, presents with plenty of air and light. The result is exemplary as a David Smith experience, an American Modernism experience and a Guggenheim Museum experience. (212) 423-3500. (Holland Cotter)

* International Center of Photography: 'Snap Judgments: New Positions in Contemporary African Photography,' through May 28. If Martians tuned into our television news broadcasts, they'd have a miserable impression of life on Earth. War, disease, poverty, heartbreak and nothing else. That's exactly how most of the world sees Africa: filtered through images of calamity. The Nigerian-born curator Okwui Enwezor offers a bracing alternative view in this show of recent photography from Africa. He isn't interested in simply exchanging an upbeat Africa for a downbeat one, smiles for frowns, but in engineering a slow, complex, panoptical turn in perspective, one that takes in many moods and directions. The results are stimulating, astringent, brimming with life. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Cotter)

METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'HATSHEPSUT,' through July 9. Can a queen be a king, too? Consider the case of Hatshepsut, an Egyptian ruler of the 15th century B.C. She assumed the supreme title of pharaoh and ruled Egypt in that powerfully masculine role until her death. Hatshepsut is the subject of a celebratory show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, one that commemorates the 100th anniversary of the Met's department of Egyptian art. Organized by the Met and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, it includes many objects from the Met's own extensive holdings, excavated at its digs in the 1920's and 30's. But it isn't so easy to follow Hatshepsut's trail in this ambitious show, what with the number of relatives, subordinates, minor officials and such who also have a place in it, along with scarabs, jewelry, pottery, furniture and other artifacts. (212) 535-7710. (Glueck)

Met: KARA WALKER AT THE MET: 'AFTER THE DELUGE,' through July 30. The Metropolitan Museum of Art's first foray into artist-organized shows is a small tour de force of curatorial creativity. Inspired partly by Hurricane Katrina, Ms. Walker has combined works from the Met with examples of her own art, connecting shared themes of race, poverty and water to illuminate contemporary art's inevitable dialogue with past art. The show has as many crosscurrents and undertows as a river. (See above.) (Smith)

THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'EDVARD MUNCH: THE MODERN LIFE OF THE SOUL,' through May 8. This affecting, full-scale retrospective is the first survey of this Norwegian painter in an American museum in almost 30 years. Its more than 130 oils and works on paper cover Munch's entire career, from 1880 to 1944. (212) 708-9400. (Glueck)

* The Museum of Modern Art: 'Without Boundary: Seventeen Ways of Looking,' through May 22. This excellent group show considers what ''Islamic'' means in the work of several contemporary artists, and it means many things, none simple. Just to see the uses made of calligraphy by Shirazeh Houshiary, Rachid Koraichi and Shirin Neshat is to understand the lesson in variety put forward here. At the same time, the show is far from didactic. It's beautiful, sexy and, in the case of Raqib Shaw's painting and Kutlug Ataman's video of Sufi meditation, ecstatic. (See above.) (Cotter)

National Academy Museum: 'Treasures from Olana: Landscapes by Frederic Edwin Church,' through April 30. Exquisite small landscape studies by the best of the Hudson River School painters. They are from the collection at Olana, the Persian-style Victorian mansion -- now a museum -- that Church built on an upstate hill overlooking the Hudson River. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880. (Ken Johnson)

NEUE GALERIE: 'KLEE AND AMERICA,' through May 22. For a long time, the Swiss-born artist Paul Klee (1879-1940), regarded as a leading Modernist figure in Europe, didn't believe his delicate, chimerical work had much of a future in the United States. Yet, thanks to artists, collectors and dealers with close contacts in Germany who had begun to discover his work, by the early 1920's, Klee's impact began to be felt here. This show of more than 60 paintings and drawings assembled exclusively from American holdings covers the wide spectrum of Klee's work. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200. (Glueck)

P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center: 'The Thirteen: Chinese Video Now,' through May 1. A snappy roundup of recent video, a favored medium among young artists in a digitally savvy 21st-century China, this show has two fine pieces by Cao Fei, who has garnered much attention recently. It is also the occasion for several worthy New York debuts. Some of the art is light, slight, and MTV-ish, but artists like Cui Xiuwen, Xu Zhen, Li Songhua, Xu Tan, Meng Jin and Dong Wensheng give us a lot. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084.(Cotter)

* The Studio Museum In harlem: 'Energy/Experimentation: Black Artists and Abstraction, 1964-1980,' through July 2. During one of the most radical periods in 20th-century American politics, the Black Power era, a group of African-American artists was working in one of the most radical forms of 20th-century art, abstraction. This show is stylishly installed (one gallery bursts with color, another has a cool platinum shimmer); the 15 artists are intensely individualistic and part of an important history. One, the sculptor Tom Lloyd (1921-96), opened the Studio Museum with a solo show in 1968. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Cotter)

Whitney Museum of American Art: 'WHITNEY BIENNIAL 2006: DAY FOR NIGHT,' through May 28. This biennial will provoke much head-scratching by uninitiated visitors. A hermetic take on what has been making waves, it's packaged -- branded might be the better word -- as a show long on collaboration and open-endedness: several shows under one roof, including a revival of the 1960's ''Peace Tower,'' which rises like a Tinker Toy construction from the Whitney courtyard, with contributions by dozens of artists. As a counter to the image of the art world as rich, youth-besotted and obsessed with crafty little nothings, the ethos here is provisional, messy, half-baked, cantankerous, insular -- radical qualities art used to have when it could still call itself radical and wasn't like a barnacle clinging to the cruise ship of pop culture. That was back in the 1970's. And much of what's here (including works by bohemians and other senior eccentrics around then) harks back to that moment. (800) 944-8639 or www.whitney.org. (Kimmelman)

Galleries: Uptown

* ECHOES FROM THE STEPPES: MONGOLIAN 17TH-, 18TH- AND 19TH-CENTURY BRONZES AND PAINTINGS The bronzes represent the four styles of Mongolian religious sculpture, but the main event is the 77 sakhuis paintings -- small, finely wrought, richly colored portraits of Buddhist priests and protective or wrathful deities that the nomadic Mongols wore, framed in silver, as amulets. E. & J. Frankel, 1040 Madison Avenue, at 79th Street, (212) 879-5733, through May 6. (Smith)

'1968: All in a Dream' In 1968 the photographer Lenny Gottlieb saved 30,000 snapshots that were supposed to have been thrown out at the photographic processing lab where he was working. Approximately 500 of them are on view here; collectively, they offer an enthralling cross-section of American life during a year of tremendous change. Andrew Roth, 160A East 70th Street, (212) 717-9067, through April 29. (Johnson)

Galleries: 57th Street

Darren Almond /Janice Kerbel: 'The Impossible Landscape' Nothing is obvious in this handsome show of works by two London-based Conceptualists. The connection is that both make visible things that are in different ways impossible. Ms. Kerbel's elegantly abstracted designs for gardens in an office, a Laundromat and other unlikely places are meant to be imagined but never actually built. Mr. Almond's sumptuous, subtly eerie landscape photographs were shot at night using long exposures, making visible what would be invisible to the naked eye. The Horticultural Society of New York, 128 West 58th Street, (212) 757-0915, through May 5. (Johnson)

Galleries: SoHo

'When Artists Say We' This timely sociological experiment of a show features 17 artists or artist groups who were invited to create wall-diagrams or mini-exhibitions reflecting on the social networks out of which contemporary art emerges. Artists Space, 38 Green Street, (212) 226-3970, through April 29. (Johnson)

Other Galleries

'B-Side' This engaging group show includes Tim Spelios's beautifully made Surrealistic drum set in which the components are square rather than round; Matt Freedman's life-size sculpture of a boy with a lion's teeth and elephant eyes; Mary Carlson's crocheted works, resembling splats of blood on the wall; Joyce Pensato's expressionistically painted clown face; Judith Page's ghoulish and viscous small portraits; Meredith Allen's funny and scary photographs of dogs; and a painting by Jim Torok that declares: ''You have no worries. Things are going well. Don't wake up.'' Sarah Bowen, 210 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 302-4517, through April 30. (Johnson)

'Zoo Story' A clay gorilla by Daisy Youngblood, a bronze she-wolf by Kiki Smith, a flock of concrete sheep by Francoise-Xavier Lalanne and works about animals by more than 20 other artists, including John Baldessari, Katharina Fritsch, Ross Bleckner and Rebecca Horn, turn the first floor of this sleek, three-story private museum into a diverting menagerie. Fisher Landau Center for Art, 38-27 30th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 937-0727, through Oct. 16. (Johnson)

Last Chance

PETER BEGLEY Parisian esprit enlivens Peter Begley's latest multipanel paintings. Their motif is the cornice: a ubiquitous emblem of Baron Haussmann's grand boulevards, which, abstracted and made delicately ornate, permits Mr. Begley to add illusory depth to his usual richly worked, waxy fields of warm color. Partly the filigree, partly the gentle rapture with his recently adopted city give to these new works a bit of the elan of old Raoul Dufy. Salander-OReilly, 20 East 79th Street, (212) 879-6606; through tomorrow. (Kimmelman)

'JANE FREILICHER: NEAR THE SEA: PAINTINGS 1958-63 The beautifully relaxed, nearly abstract paintings that were Jane Freilicher's initial response to the vistas of eastern Long Island add a surprising piece to the unruly puzzle of late-1950's art and sharpen your sense of her ambition and achievement. Tibor de Nagy Gallery, 724 Fifth Avenue, near 57th Street, (212) 262-5050; through tomorrow. (Smith)

NAN GOLDIN: 'CHASING A GHOST' A riveting if flawed three-screen video projection titled ''Sisters, Saints & Sibyls'' hauntingly details the trauma that drives Ms. Goldin's invasive, yet oddly solitary photographs, as well as her lifelong battle with addiction.Its unalloyed honesty offers extreme evidence that most art begins in an attempt to heal a deep psychic wound. Matthew Marks Gallery, 522 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 243-0200; through tomorrow. (Smith)

Markus Hansen: 'Other People's Feelings Are Also My Own' In high-definition video projections of pairs of photographs, Mr. Hansen, a Paris-based German artist, dresses like and adopts the facial expression of the man, woman or child in the picture next to his. Whatever his project means to say about modern identity, it is absorbing to study how closely he is able to match other people's feelings. Virgil de Voldere, 526 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 343-9694; through tomorrow. (Johnson)

* MARK LECKeY: 'DRUNKEN BAKERS' This cinematically gifted British artist raises his game with a stop-action animation made by simply shooting a raunchy, well-drawn comic strip for adults in close-up, turning its speech balloons into spoken dialogue and adding realistic sound effects. Shown in an increasingly grubby white-on-white cube, the work is elegantly efficient, funny and dark. GBE @ Passerby, 436 West 15th Street, Chelsea, (212) 627-5258; through tomorrow. (Smith)

Susie Rosmarin Proving that Op Art still is not dead, Ms. Rosmarin creates densely layered, gridded compositions of thin colored bands. The tautly frontal, vibrating patterns and pulsating spots of light engender a gripping retinal intensity. Danese, 535 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 223-2227; through tomorrow. (Johnson)

HEADLINE: Democrats Eager to Exploit Anger Over Gas Prices 

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 20 

 BODY:
Democrats running for Congress are moving quickly to use the most recent surge in oil and gasoline prices to bash Republicans over energy policy, and more broadly, the direction of the country.
 With oil prices hitting a high this week and prices at the pump topping $3 a gallon in many places, Amy Klobuchar, a Democratic Senate candidate in Minnesota, is making the issue the centerpiece of her campaign. Ms. Klobuchar says it ''is one of the first things people bring up'' at her campaign stops.
To varying degrees, Democrats around the country are following a similar script that touches on economic anxiety and populist resentment against oil companies. 
 ''It's a metaphor for an economy that keeps biting people despite overall good numbers,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Mr. Schumer said Democratic candidates in 10 of the 34 Senate races this year had scheduled campaign events this week focusing on gasoline prices.
 Officials at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which advises House candidates, said they sent a memorandum to candidates on Thursday offering guidance on using the issue to their advantage. The memorandum includes a ''sample statement'' that recommends telling voters, ''Americans are tired of giving billion-dollar tax subsidies to energy companies and foreign countries while paying record prices at the pump.''
 Increasing gasoline prices have put Republicans on the defensive at a time when they are counting on the economy to help offset the myriad other problems they face, starting with the Iraq war.
 Republicans say they have spent years advocating policies that would reduce the reliance on imported oil, largely by promoting more domestic energy production, and they point to the energy bill that President Bush signed last August as a step in that direction. They said that the law encouraged conservation and greater use of ethanol in gasoline and that it would have done more for domestic oil supplies if Democrats had not fought so hard against drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
 Mr. Bush tried to get ahead of the issue in January in his State of the Union address, saying that the nation is addicted to oil and urging steps to reduce reliance on energy imports.
 The White House and Republicans on Capitol Hill have worked closely together for months on a campaign to highlight what they say is the strength of the economy, partly to offset what administration officials acknowledge are the negative psychological effects of high oil and gasoline prices on consumers. A Washington Post/ABC News poll this week found that 59 percent of Americans rated the economy ''not good'' or ''poor,'' despite solid economic growth and declining unemployment.
 ''The better we are at getting out the overall message that the economy is growing and the reasons behind it, the better we'll be able to deflect the silly political attacks from the Democrats,'' said Brian Nick, a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. 
 Democrats are tailoring campaign messages to pierce any economic good news by focusing on other aspects of the energy law, chiefly the subsidies worth nearly $15 billion for gas and oil companies and the bill's lack of a more muscular approach to conserve energy and reduce the dependence on foreign oil. 
 While Democrats are eagerly laying blame for the situation on the Republicans, they did little to advance energy measures in eight years under President Bill Clinton. Democrats remain split to some degree over how to proceed, but in general favor greater investment in ''clean fuel'' technologies, more incentives for driving fuel-efficient vehicles and stronger steps toward reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. Those positions were included in a measure sponsored last year by more than 30 Democratic House members who opposed the Republican version of the energy bill. Even so, 75 Democrats in the House and 25 in the Senate voted with the Republicans to pass Mr. Bush's bill.
 The recommendations of the memorandum to Democratic candidates include holding a campaign event at a gas station ''where you call for a real commitment to bringing down gas prices and pledge that, as a member of Congress, you will fight for families in your district, not the oil and gas executives for which the Republican Congress has fought so hard.''
 A survey by Public Agenda, a nonpartisan research organization, in the latest issue of Foreign Affairs magazine suggests that the message could not be more timely. The survey said voters now believed that fears over energy independence rivaled the Iraq war as the leading foreign policy issue for the nation.
 Daniel Yankelovich, chairman of Public Agenda, said the survey found that 90 percent of Americans viewed the lack of energy independence as a risk to security, that 88 percent said problems abroad were endangering supplies and increasing prices and that 85 percent believed that the federal government could do something if it tried.
 In a similar survey six months earlier, Mr. Yankelovich said, just Iraq generated those levels of concern.
 ''If Democrats can make an explicit connection that Senator So-and-so could have done more but didn't, the message will resonate among voters,'' he said. ''This has really become a hot-button issue.''
 If voter anger stays high, Democrats, as the minority party, stand to benefit most, said Amy Walter, a political analyst for The Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan newsletter.
 ''Angry voters are motivated voters,'' Ms. Walter said. ''If the message in November is one of change, this is helping to make the case for Democrats.''
 The spotlight on energy also provides environmentalists and liberals generally opportunities to make broader points. Amid a blaze of publicity, former Vice President Al Gore is about to release a documentary about global warming that urges, among other points, more aggressive steps to cut tailpipe emissions.
 Even as high gasoline prices create an incentive to conserve -- something environmentalists have sought to achieve through proposals like higher taxes on energy -- the impact of high-priced gas hits hard in suburban and rural districts, where families are forced to drive greater distances for routine needs. Many of those regions are predominantly Republican.
 In Minnesota, the leading Republican candidate for the open Senate seat, Representative Mark Kennedy, a three-term congressman, said he also heard voters' anger and frustration. 
 Reflecting the dangers facing his party over fuel costs, Mr. Kennedy said he told voters that the energy bill was not enough and pointed out that he is a co-sponsor, with Representative Mark Udall, Democrat of Colorado, of a bill that calls for taking back tax credits from energy companies and doubling investments in ethanol and other renewable fuels.

HEADLINE: BUSH AND HU VOW NEW COOPERATION 

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 20 

 BODY:
President Bush and China's president, Hu Jintao, pledged to cooperate more closely on fighting nuclear proliferation and reducing trade imbalances on Thursday, but broke no new ground on the most delicate issues that divide the two nations.
 The meeting, the first at the White House between the men since Mr. Hu became China's top leader in 2002, was plagued by gaffes that upended months of painstaking diplomacy over protocol and staging.
Though administration officials said significant progress was made, especially on the economic front, the session also underscored the intractable nature of a long list of grievances between the world's richest country and its fastest rising rival. 
 No new agreements were announced after Oval Office negotiations and a working lunch.
 The occasion was disrupted when a member of the Falun Gong spiritual sect, accredited as a reporter for a sect-run publication to cover the ceremony at the White House, interrupted Mr. Hu's address and upset the elaborate choreography the Chinese delegation had regarded as the most important trophy of Mr. Hu's visit. Screaming, ''President Bush, make him stop persecuting Falun Gong,'' the ethnic Chinese woman, Wenyi Wang, partly drowned out Mr. Hu. She continued shouting for more than a minute before security officers removed her.
 Mr. Bush later apologized to Mr. Hu for the incident, White House officials said. But Chinese Foreign Ministry officials traveling with Mr. Hu canceled an afternoon briefing. One delegation member, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the subject publicly, described his superiors as outraged by the breach.
 Compounding the gaffe, a White House announcer introducing the national anthems at the same ceremony mistakenly referred to China as the Republic of China, which is the formal name of its archrival, Taiwan. Mainland China is the People's Republic of China. China treats American support for Taiwan, a separately governed island that China claims as its sovereign territory, as the biggest irritant in bilateral relations. Even minuscule changes in the wording of diplomatic statements on the subject are often viewed as transformative on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.
 While it is unclear whether the Chinese will interpret the two incidents as simple mistakes or as overt efforts to embarrass Mr. Hu, there was no indication that they derailed the private discussions between the presidents that followed.
 The two men emerged from the Oval Office and agreed to accept several questions from the news media, a rarity for Mr. Hu, an aloof leader who almost never interacts with the press. 
 Mr. Bush said the countries would ''deepen our cooperation in addressing threats to global security, including the nuclear ambitions of Iran, the genocide in Darfur, Sudan, the violence unleashed by terrorists and extremists and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.''
 He acknowledged that the two men ''do not agree on everything'' but said, ''We're able to discuss our disagreements in a spirit of friendship and cooperation.''
 Mr. Hu also acknowledged that ''different opinions or even frictions'' had complicated the relationship. But he emphasized that China believed that the areas of agreement outweighed the differences.
 ''China and the United States share extensive common interests, and there is a broad prospect for the mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries,'' he said.
 Mr. Bush said he discussed with Mr. Hu the possibility of passing a United Nations Security Council motion against Iran that would permit imposing sanctions ranging from economic penalties to military strikes. China has repeatedly rejected the idea as an unnecessary escalation of the nuclear standoff.
 Mr. Hu emphasized that China would only support steps that enhanced dialogue and did not suggest any inclination to embrace Mr. Bush's idea.
 Mr. Hu said multinational talks to end North Korea's nuclear program had run into difficulties, but he did not outline new steps that China would take to bring North Korea back to the bargaining table. Mr. Bush urged him to do more to use China's ''considerable influence'' to get results after years of inconclusive diplomacy.
 Bush administration officials were more upbeat about the discussion on economic issues, including China's incipient steps to allow its currency, the yuan, to appreciate and efforts by Mr. Hu to reduce China's reliance on exports and stimulate domestic demand as a source of growth.
 As it has many times before, China has promised to buy more American goods and to crack down on industrial-scale piracy of American copyrights and trademarks. But after announcing a broad commitment to those goals earlier this month, China presented no new measures.
 Mr. Hu did emphasize China's intention to undertake a structural shift in its economy, which has tended to favor investment- and export-driven growth during its heady rise over the past quarter century. 
 Citing steps China has taken as part of its five-year economic plan, Mr. Hu said Beijing would seek to stimulate more consumer-led growth, in part by improving the social safety net so that consumers felt comfortable spending money rather than saving it at record high levels for health, education and retirement.
 ''China is pursuing a policy of boosting domestic demand, which means that we'll mainly rely on domestic demand to further promote economic growth,'' Mr. Hu said.
 On human rights, Mr. Hu refused to make concessions on any cases on a list that Mr. Bush presented to him last September, when they met during a session at the United Nations. Dennis Wilder, the acting senior director for East Asian affairs at the National Security Council, said Mr. Bush presented the same list to Mr. Hu again this time.
 Mr. Hu did get a big part of what Chinese analysts said he came for: images of him with the American president on the White House lawn, as Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin, his predecessors, had posed for.
 The pomp included an elaborate honor guard, a military band, a fife and drum corps and the full 21-gun salute given visiting heads of state.
 But the protocol for the meeting was already a sore point for the Chinese, who argued for months that Mr. Hu's first trip here as president must be a full state visit. The White House declined to offer him a state dinner, however, and has called the session a ''working visit.''
 The heckling by the protester is likely to exacerbate the spat over protocol. Chinese television viewers will now almost certainly get a censored view of the event. Mr. Wilder said he did not expect the incident to have significant repercussions. But, he said, ''I'm not going to stand here and say they are not upset.''

HEADLINE: The Great Revulsion

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
''I have a vision -- maybe just a hope -- of a great revulsion: a moment in which the American people look at what is happening, realize how their good will and patriotism have been abused, and put a stop to this drive to destroy much of what is best in our country.'' 
 I wrote those words three years ago in the introduction to my column collection, ''The Great Unraveling.'' It seemed a remote prospect at the time: Baghdad had just fallen to U.S. troops, and President Bush had a 70 percent approval rating. 
Now the great revulsion has arrived. The latest Fox News poll puts Mr. Bush's approval at only 33 percent. According to the polling firm Survey USA, there are only four states in which significantly more people approve of Mr. Bush's performance than disapprove: Utah, Idaho, Wyoming and Nebraska. If we define red states as states where the public supports Mr. Bush, Red America now has a smaller population than New York City.
 The proximate causes of Mr. Bush's plunge in the polls are familiar: the heck of a job he did responding to Katrina, the prescription drug debacle and, above all, the quagmire in Iraq. 
 But focusing too much on these proximate causes makes Mr. Bush's political fall from grace seem like an accident, or the result of specific missteps. That gets things backward. In fact, Mr. Bush's temporarily sky-high approval ratings were the aberration; the public never supported his real policy agenda.
 Remember, in 2000 Mr. Bush got within hanging-chad and felon-purge distance of the White House only by pretending to be a moderate. In 2004 he ran on fear and smear, plus the pretense that victory in Iraq was just around the corner. (I've always thought that the turning point of the 2004 campaign was the September 2004 visit of the Iraqi prime minister, Ayad Allawi, a figurehead appointed by the Bush administration who rewarded his sponsors by presenting a falsely optimistic picture of the situation in Iraq.)
 The real test of the conservative agenda came after the 2004 election, when Mr. Bush tried to sell the partial privatization of Social Security.
 Social Security was for economic conservatives what Iraq was for the neocons, a soft target that they thought would pave the way for bigger conquests. And there couldn't have been a more favorable moment for privatization than the winter of 2004-2005: Mr. Bush loved to assert that he had a ''mandate'' from the election; Republicans held solid, disciplined majorities in both houses of Congress; and many prominent political pundits were in favor of private accounts.
 Yet Mr. Bush's drive on Social Security ran into a solid wall of public opposition, and collapsed within a few months. And if Social Security couldn't be partly privatized under those conditions, the conservative dream of dismantling the welfare state is nothing but a fantasy.
 So what's left of the conservative agenda? Not much. 
 That's not a prediction for the midterm elections. The Democrats will almost surely make gains, but the electoral system is rigged against them. The fewer than eight million residents of what's left of Red America are represented by eight U.S. senators; the more than eight million residents of New York City have to share two senators with the rest of New York State.
 Meanwhile, a combination of accident and design has left likely Democratic voters bunched together -- I'm tempted to say ghettoized -- in a minority of Congressional districts, while likely Republican voters are more widely spread out. As a result, Democrats would need a landslide in the popular vote -- something like an advantage of 8 to 10 percentage points over Republicans -- to take control of the House of Representatives. That's a real possibility, given the current polls, but by no means a certainty. 
 And there is also, of course, the real prospect that Mr. Bush will change the subject by bombing Iran.
 Still, in the long run it may not matter that much. If the Democrats do gain control of either house of Congress, and with it the ability to issue subpoenas, a succession of scandals will be revealed in the final years of the Bush administration. But even if the Republicans hang on to their ability to stonewall, it's hard to see how they can resurrect their agenda. 
 In retrospect, then, the 2004 election looks like the high-water mark of a conservative tide that is now receding.

HEADLINE: An Old Presidential Predicament: China Proves Tough to Influence

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 20 

 BODY:
Just about every American president since Richard M. Nixon has confronted the fact that his influence over China is far more limited than he once hoped. President Bush is now facing that reality midway through his second term, at a moment when the Chinese clearly sense his weakness.
 Mr. Bush's predicament was on display during his encounters on Thursday with President Hu Jintao, in which Mr. Bush made it clear that the status quo was unacceptable -- that America's $200 billion annual trade deficit is ''unsustainable,'' that Iran needs to face sanctions to force it to halt its nuclear program, and that China must ''use its considerable influence'' to make sure North Korea is disarmed. 
Mr. Hu acknowledged that each of those issues needed attention, but deflected every effort to commit China to concrete action. It was the fifth time that the two men have met in the past year. The mood was friendly, yet the tension was unmistakable.
 ''Each side leaves with frustrations, and you could particularly hear that in President Bush's tone,'' said Kurt Campbell, an Asian expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. 
 The United States was unhappy with progress on issues critical to the American agenda; the Chinese were unhappy that Mr. Hu has rarely been out of the earshot of protesters.
 Arriving in Seattle earlier in the week, Mr. Hu was greeted as the leader of a huge and growing customer. In Washington, Mr. Bush referred instead to China as a ''stakeholder,'' a word intended as a message that it must use its power for more than commercial gain. Mr. Bush made clear that in his view Beijing must stop regarding places like Iran and Sudan as suppliers of the oil China needs to fuel its growth, and start regarding them as international problems that China needs to help solve. 
 During his 2000 campaign, Mr. Bush described Beijing as a ''strategic competitor'' whose ambitions for global influence must be contained. Now he prefers to say America's relationship with the Chinese is ''complicated,'' reflecting a conversion that he took a step further on Thursday to declare that ''China and the United States share extensive common strategic interests.'' 
 Perhaps that should have been no surprise. Like Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton before him, Mr. Bush came to office convinced that if he set tougher rules about engaging China, the Chinese would change their behavior. They quickly came to abandon that view. 
 ''A number of presidents since Nixon have come to office with negative views of the Chinese,'' said Brent Scowcroft, national security adviser to President Bush's father. ''They always end up supporting the thrust of the policy established by President Nixon,'' one of engagement.
 But for this President Bush, whose first dealings with the Chinese involved recovering American airmen whose spy plane was forced down off the Chinese coast, it has been a slow transition, and an unhappy one. 
 And now, some members of his administration concede when promised anonymity, Mr. Bush needs a breakthrough in the relationship -- on North Korea, where China has the most influence, or Iran, where it is a major oil customer, or on the trade deficit that has grown so large, with no end in sight.
 He appears increasingly unlikely to get that breakthrough. 
 Mr. Bush clearly thought his biggest opportunity was on the Korean crisis, where he decided to engage all of North Korea's neighbors, with the Chinese as host, in an effort to convince Kim Jong Il, North Korea's leader, that he has no choice but to give up a small arsenal of nuclear weapons. Those talks have stretched on for more than two years. 
 Mr. Bush frequently notes that the Chinese share his goal of a nuclear-free Korean peninsula, and Mr. Hu affirmed that on Thursday. But the reality, officials acknowledge in background conversations, is that the Chinese are not unhappy with the status quo, because the last thing they want is chaos on their border with North Korea, or a collapse of that government.
 Iran has proved only slightly less frustrating for Mr. Bush. Again the Chinese say they share the long-term goal of making sure Tehran does not get a nuclear weapon, but they have opposed any use of sanctions, or even discussion of a military option if diplomacy fails. So when Mr. Bush raised the possibility of pressing Iran by using a section of the United Nations Charter that allows for enforcement, Mr. Hu stayed silent. 
 Mr. Hu has given slightly more on the issue of freeing China's currency so that its value rises, a way of curbing the trade deficit because the price of Chinese goods would gradually rise. But it has been a painfully slow process, leaving Congress frustrated and threatening to take action. 
 Mr. Bush had hoped for better. When Mr. Hu took office, one of Mr. Bush's top foreign policy advisers said that since the two men were of the same generation, they should be able to communicate easily. 
 Mr. Hu was viewed as a technocrat, not an ideologue; a reformer willing to acknowledge, as he did Thursday, that his country's modernization had to be accompanied by some level of democratization.
 But he has made clear to Mr. Bush that his focus is on keeping the peace at home, where economic change to a more market-based economy has been wrenching. And so for the Chinese, the status quo works: China is growing, its influence in Asia is expanding, its military ascendancy along the coast facing Taiwan is striking, and its economy is on a path toward overtaking Japan's. 
 Mr. Hu apparently no longer feels, as past Chinese leaders did, that he must come to the United States bearing gifts. And the Chinese, ever sensitive to questions of status, made clear they felt slighted by Mr. Bush's decision not to offer up a full state dinner for the leader of 1.3 billion people; instead, Mr. Hu got lunch. 
 And in return, Mr. Bush got vague promises that China would continue doing what it is already doing -- at its own pace.

An Architect Of the Sepulchral Rises to the Surface
 Perhaps only an architect plagued with bad luck his entire professional life would develop a passion for designing tombs. Virtually unknown in America until recently, the British architect Joseph Gandy (1771-1843) was a Romantic visionary, inspired architectural illustrator and connoisseur of what came to be known as sepulcher architecture.
 Some of Gandy's imaginary landscapes will be on view from Wednesday through July 22 at the Richard L. Feigen gallery, at 34 East 69th Street in Manhattan. The show includes a watercolor of a sepulchral chamber, a pen-and-ink study for ''The Tomb of Merlin'' and an ''Architectural Idea of the Hall of Pandemonium From Milton's 'Paradise Lost.' ''
The guest curator is Brian Lukacher, a Gandy scholar and professor of art history at Vassar College, who worked with Dr. Ann Guite of the Feigen gallery. The show coincides with the publication of Mr. Lukacher's book ''Joseph Gandy: An Architectural Visionary in Georgian England'' (Thames & Hudson). The paintings and drawings are loans from private collectors and museums including the Getty, the Yale Center for British Art and Sir John Soane's Museum in London. 
 In 1983, while writing his dissertation on Gandy, Mr. Lukacher organized an exhibition of Gandy drawings at the Architectural Association in London. ''After that, I finished my dissertation and put Gandy aside,'' he said. ''Then I came back to him.'' His book is the first large-scale monograph on the architect.
 Gandy was a man of unfulfilled promise, a talent praised by critics and ignored by the public (and patrons). The painter John Constable called him a genius of architecture, but he died penniless in an insane asylum in Devon, England, on Christmas Day in 1843, leaving behind a wife and six children (three others had died). It is not known where he is buried.
 He came from humble beginnings. Born in London, he was one of 12 children of Thomas and Sophia Gandy. Thomas Gandy was a waiter at White's, an elite men's club, from 1779 to 1797. In 1787, Thomas showed some of Joseph's untutored drawings to James Wyatt, a popular country-house architect. Wyatt took the precocious 16-year-old into his office and taught him the techniques and conventions of architectural drawing.
 In 1789, undoubtedly with Wyatt's support, Gandy entered the Royal Academy's art school. There he copied bookplates of archaeological discoveries and neo-Palladian pattern books, and took lessons from a topographical watercolorist. From 1790 to 1794, he exhibited original schemes for monumental mausoleums, an ancient bath and a public library. 
 In 1790, Sir Joshua Reynolds, the president of the academy, awarded Gandy a gold medal, its highest honor, for his design of a triumphal arch. Between 1789 and 1838, Gandy had at least 113 pictures shown there. Mr. Lukacher said more than a third of them were yet to be discovered.
 After his schooling, with the help of an affluent backer, Gandy set off for Italy, a must for any serious 18th-century architect who felt he needed to assimilate the vocabulary of ancient architecture firsthand. 
 Gandy was quite active during his three years in Rome, making hundreds of studies and architectural drawings of the Pantheon, the catacombs, the ancient tombs of Roman heroes lining the Appian Way and Roman monuments in the Forum. A few of these sketches are in the Feigen show.
 He also did landscape watercolors as a visual diary, combining architectural renderings with Poussin-inspired pastoral scenes.
 Mr. Feigen has some small Gandy landscape watercolors for sale (they are not part of the show), at prices ranging from $6,000 to $12,000. Gandy never signed his work, but on some of the paintings he noted the place, month and time of day they were made. They have the freshness of Turner's atmospheric, light-filled sketches. (Turner was younger than Gandy, but they knew each other -- Turner got the job teaching perspective at the Royal Academy that Gandy coveted.)
 Gandy's luck started running out when Napoleon's troops occupied Rome in 1796. The city became chaotic and unsafe, and Gandy was not able to take his notebooks with him when he escaped the city in 1797.
 He arrived home in London with no money, no patrons and no prospects. England was in the middle of an economic recession. As Gandy wrote in his third-person autobiography, ''On his return he found himself alone in the greatest metropolis in the world; the ideal castles, palaces and mansions he had fostered in his mind, and in which he dwelt with so much pleasure on the Continent, and fondly hoped to rear in England, were vanished.'' 
 Like New York architects short of work in the 1980's, Gandy began creating ''buildings of the mind,'' among them his macabre ''Design for a Cast-Iron Necropolis,'' which would store the dead in tiny metal cylinders. His ''Sepulchral Chamber'' of 1800, at the Feigen gallery, depicts a dark, shadowy Greek temple with a carved sarcophagus mysteriously illuminated in a circle of light.
 Such visionary works drew praise. A contemporary critic at The Literary Gazette called Gandy ''an artist full of the learning of his profession, imbued with the richest memories of Greece, and a man of Genius,'' adding: ''Mr. Gandy must have been distinguished wherever his noble art found honor. He would have been eminent in the time of Louis XIV Leo X Pericles.''
 But not in the time of George IV. The king had no interest in Gandy's grand designs for new Houses of Commons and Lords or a proposed residence for the Duke of Wellington to commemorate the Battle of Waterloo (complete with sepulchral garden). Gandy retreated into occult scholarship, and kept busy by illustrating scenes from mythology and classical literature. He went to debtors' prison twice before his family delivered him into an asylum. Today, his descendants reportedly continue a tradition that Gandy's son Thomas instigated: No one should ever go into the fine arts.
 Mr. Feigen has been interested in Gandy since 1993, when he spotted a Gandy painting in a Vienna auction house's catalog. ''I bought it, and then I got more into him,'' he said. ''I have a tendency to react to things I feel are on the cutting edge -- or were when they were done. They carry forward an excitement.
 ''In Gandy I see an artist taking risks,'' Mr. Feigen continued. ''I react to his eccentric Romanticism. His work is scarce, though I have sold Gandy watercolors to the Met and the L.A. County Museum. With this exhibition, I'm trying to make Gandy better known.''

HEADLINE: 2 Airlines Say Sales Rose 20% in Quarter

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Southwest Airlines said yesterday that first-quarter net income rose, while Continental Airlines narrowed its losses as sales at each carrier rose about 20 percent.
 Southwest's net income increased 3.4 percent, to $61 million, or 7 cents a share, from $59 million, also 7 cents a share, a year earlier, the airline said yesterday. Continental said its loss narrowed to $66 million, or 76 cents a share, from a loss of $184 million, or $2.77 a share, a year earlier. 
The carriers were able to raise fares because of stronger passenger demand, helping counter jet-fuel prices that were 26 percent higher than last year. Southwest, which is based in Dallas, benefited from hedges that protected it against rising fuel costs. Continental, based in Houston, reduced labor expenses to stem losses.
 ''The revenue performance is the strongest that we've seen since 2000,'' said William Warlick, a Chicago-based analyst for Fitch Ratings.
 Airlines raised fares three times in the first quarter, with Southwest leading one of the moves in its largest increase in 25 years. ''So far, demand has really held up,'' said Helane Becker, an analyst in New York for the Benchmark Company. ''We'll see what happens when prices continue to go up.''
 Southwest said sales rose 21 percent, to $2.02 billion, from $1.66 billion. Southwest is raising ticket prices as it loses the benefit of fuel hedges. Even with such protection, Southwest said its first-quarter fuel costs rose 80 percent, to $501 million, helping push overall expenses up by 21 percent, to $1.92 billion.
 ''It's a real concern,'' Mr. Warlick said. ''We're going to be looking at more fuel cost pressures for Southwest over the next couple years.''
 The cost increase also reflected the airline's 9 percent growth in airline capacity, or available seats, and an 11 percent increase in passengers.
 Continental's sales rose 18 percent, to $2.95 billion from $2.51 billion, as its passenger traffic climbed 12 percent. The rise in traffic came as the airline carrier increased flight capacity 11 percent. Customers paid fares that were about 4.1 percent higher on average.
 Costs for the quarter rose 9.6 percent, to $2.9 billion, with a 41 percent rise in fuel expense, to $661 million. Labor expense, the biggest cost, declined 6 percent, to $672 million. The company this year reached a labor agreement with its flight attendants' union, completing a round of new contracts with its labor groups to save $500 million annually.

HEADLINE: Leading Indicators Decline; So Do Jobless Claims

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
A gauge of future economic activity slipped for a second month in March, hinting at slower growth ahead, while separate data showed that mid-Atlantic factory activity rose in April despite higher costs. 
 A third economic report suggested strength in the job market.
 The data supported analysts' expectations that strong first-quarter growth would cool to more sustainable levels, although the tight labor market and high commodity prices would keep the Federal Reserve on watch for inflation pressure.
 The Conference Board, an independent research group, said its index of leading economic indicators, which is aimed at forecasting economic activity, fell 0.1 percent in March after a downward-revised 0.5 percent decrease in February.
 ''With the price of a barrel of oil rising above $70,'' said Ken Goldstein, the board labor economist, ''and with interest rates slowly increasing, the global economy isn't likely to be picking up steam soon.'' 
 Wall Street economists surveyed by Reuters had expected the March index to be unchanged.
 Steven Wood, chief economist at Insight Economics, commented: ''The leading indicators have been much more volatile since Hurricane Katrina. However, the trend has been generally flat over the past six months, at levels that are well below where they were 12 to 18 months ago. 
 ''This suggests that economic growth in the year ahead should be weaker than in the past year. But it doesn't suggest that growth will be extremely sluggish or will turn negative.''
 The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said its business activity index rose to 13.2 in April, from 12.3 in March, below Wall Street estimates of 14.0, while surging commodities prices pushed inflation readings higher.
 New orders dropped sharply in April, as did inventories, suggesting that manufacturers would need to rebuild supplies in coming months. 
 In addition, data from the Labor Department showed that new claims for jobless benefits fell by 10,000 last week, slightly more than expected. The benefit claims declined to 303,000 in the week ended April 15, from 313,000 the previous week.
 ''Over all, it does suggest that labor market conditions are very tight still,'' said Jeff Cheah, fixed-income strategist with RBC Capital Markets in Toronto, ''and the Fed probably still has one more tightening to do because recent rhetoric suggests monetary policy will get more and more data- dependent.'' 
 Weekly jobless claims have hovered around 300,000 since early in the year, a level that economists generally consider to be noninflationary while pointing to job growth.

HEADLINE: Dow Climbs to 6-Year High, But Broad Market Is Mixed

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks closed mixed yesterday after earnings reports from General Motors and Merck pushed the Dow Jones industrial average to a six-year high, while the Nasdaq composite index fell along with eBay.
 Google's first-quarter earnings, reported after the close of the regular session, sent the stock sharply higher in after-hours trading and pointed to greater investor enthusiasm today.
Oil futures retreated from record highs. A barrel of light crude hit a record of $72.49 in trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange before falling to $71.95, down 22 cents from Wednesday. 
 ''The message this week is pretty simple: People are looking for an excuse to buy stocks rather than sell stocks,'' said Ryan Larson, equity trader at Voyageur Asset Management, a subsidiary of RBC Dain Rauscher. ''A year ago, $70 oil would have been the death of us; today, the market is able to digest it and look for positives.''
 The Dow rose 64.12 points, or 0.57 percent, to 11,342.89, its highest close since Jan. 20, 2000.
 Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 1.53 points, or 0.12 percent, to 1,311.46, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 8.33 points, or 0.35 percent, to 2,362.55.
 The advances masked underlying weakness in the market. Declining issues led advancers by roughly 8 to 7 on the New York Stock Exchange.
 Economic data continued to point to moderating growth. The Conference Board, a private research group, said its index of leading economic indicators dropped to 138.4 in March from 138.5 the previous month. The declines in the index, a closely watched gauge of future economic activity, followed four consecutive months of rising readings.
 New applications for unemployment benefits dropped by 10,000, to 303,000, according to the Labor Department. The figure was the best showing since the beginning of April, suggesting that the labor market is maintaining decent momentum, but reviving fears of wage inflation.
 The day's earnings were, for the most part, strong. ''The market was relieved about the earnings coming out and mildly surprised about G.M.,'' said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at the Hartford Financial Services Group, the Connecticut-based insurance company.
 General Motors rose $2.07, to $22.64, after it reported a first-quarter loss of $323 million. While this was the company's sixth straight quarterly loss, the company did say its revenue rose 14 percent, to a record $52.2 billion, up from $45.8 billion a year ago.
 Merck's profit rose despite nearly flat sales, buoyed by higher interest income and revenue from its cholesterol drug joint venture. Merck rose 60 cents, to $35.
 The chip maker Intel fell 11 cents, to $19.45, after it reported a 38 percent decline in first-quarter profit as personal computer sales slowed. The company sharply cut its revenue forecast for 2006, blaming rising inventories of its products held by PC makers and market share losses. But investors were encouraged by its $1 billion in planned spending cuts.
 EBay, the online auction company, fell $3.58, or 8.9 percent, to $36.77 after it reported earnings that matched analysts' estimates for the first quarter and reiterated its outlook for the remainder of the year. 
 Apple Computer gained $1.98, to $67.63, after its second-quarter profit rose 41 percent, beating Wall Street estimates.
 Google said that its earnings rose 60 percent and that its revenue climbed 79 percent. The stock rose $4.50, to $415, in regular trading before the earnings report, then climbed another $33, or 8 percent, to $448 in after-hours trading.
 Bonds were lower, with the price of the benchmark 10-year note declining 4/32, to 95 27/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.04 percent, from 5.02 percent on Wednesday. The dollar was higher against most major currencies. Gold prices were lower, retreating from 25-year highs.

HEADLINE: In the Race for Ohio Governor, All Sides Agree on a Need for Change 

BYLINE: By IAN URBINA

DATELINE: COLUMBUS, Ohio, April 14 

 BODY:
In a state where the governor has been caught up in a corruption scandal and where the only thing leaving faster than manufacturing jobs is young people, candidates for governor are jockeying for the mantle of reform. 
 ''The zeitgeist is clear,'' said the likely Democratic nominee, Ted Strickland, a six-term congressman, before a packed room of donors the other day at a bar in downtown Columbus. ''People in this state want change. They're tired of scandal. They want to turn things around, and that's just what we are going to do.''
The next day, at a breakfast gathering of young professionals, the front-runner in the Republican primary, Secretary of State J. Kenneth Blackwell, sounded a similar note.
 ''We rank 47 in job creation,'' he said. ''Venture capital has increased around the country by about 10 percent but dropped in Ohio by the same amount. We've fallen on real bad times, and I want to change that.'' 
 Ohio is widely viewed as a bellwether for the 2008 presidential contest. No Republican has ever won the presidency without carrying the state, and many Democrats say the first step to larger ambitions is to break the 16-year Republican hold on the governor's mansion. Primaries for governor will be held on May 2.
 Polls give Mr. Strickland a slight edge over either Mr. Blackwell or the other Republican candidate, State Attorney General Jim Petro. But pundits are keeping a particularly close eye on Mr. Blackwell, who, in an effort to unify fiscal and religious conservatives, is melding his strong opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage with an aggressive plan to control state spending. An African-American, he also hopes to win black votes that usually go to Democrats.
 For their part, the Democrats hope to cash in on growing frustration with Republican scandals in Columbus and Washington.
 ''The governor's race is going to be the Democrats' first real test of their 'culture of corruption' argument, which they're using in races throughout the country,'' said John C. Green, director of the Ray C. Bliss Institute of Applied Politics at the University of Akron. ''It may not work everywhere, but if it's going to work anywhere, it's going to be Ohio.''
 Term limits forbid Gov. Bob Taft's re-election, though the chances he would have run otherwise are uncertain at best: Mr. Taft, son of a United States senator, grandson of another and great-grandson of President William Howard Taft, pleaded no contest in August to charges of failing to report thousands in gifts to him.
 The charges stemmed from an investigation of Mr. Taft's friend Thomas Noe, a coin dealer and prodigious Republican fund-raiser who in the past has contributed to both Mr. Blackwell and Mr. Petro. In February, Mr. Noe was charged with stealing at least $1 million from a coin investment that he managed for the Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation, and his trial, which promises to keep the scandal on voters' minds, is scheduled for August.
 ''We've had an inept, incompetent, corrupt and sometimes criminal political leadership,'' Mr. Strickland said at the recent fund-raiser, ''and in '06, with your help, we will give Ohio back to the people of Ohio.''
 Another issue is demographics and the economy. State officials estimate that Ohio has lost more than 175,000 manufacturing jobs in the last 10 years and that an average of 65 people ages 25 to 39 leave the state every day. Mr. Strickland says he wants to make Ohio more competitive through investments in broadband networks, and has proposed using unspent federal welfare money for a $50-million-a-year expansion of state-financed preschool.
 The congressman, an ordained Methodist minister, also says his experience representing a conservative district makes him equipped to move Ohio into the blue column. 
 His Democratic opponent, former State Representative Bryan E. Flannery, is trailing him by more than 40 points in the polls. But so far Mr. Strickland's biggest asset has been the acrimonious battle unfolding between the Republican candidates, whose war chests are nearly as full as his. [On April 20, the secretary of state's Web site said Mr. Strickland had raised $4.1 million since January of last year, Mr. Blackwell $3.8 million, Mr. Petro $3.4 million, and Mr. Flannery $146,000.]
 A former college football player, Mr. Blackwell is an imposing figure who seasons his speeches with references to his up-from-poverty past. (''And who would have imagined that the kid whose job it was to say 'peanuts here, get your fresh roasted peanuts' in front of the stadium would one day become a partial owner of the Cincinnati Reds?'')
 Mr. Blackwell leads Mr. Petro in the polls by about seven points and has been hammering him in speeches and television advertisements, saying that he has failed to offer a plan to control spending and that he only recently became an opponent of abortion.
 Mr. Petro, the state auditor for eight years before becoming attorney general, replied in an interview: ''Ken Blackwell's claims are just goofy. I've always been a reformer, and I've been the one promoting real cost-saving methods while his office was spending far in excess of any other in the state.''
 Mr. Petro has proposed eliminating 11,500 state employees through attrition and early retirement, a step he says would save about $1 billion a year. That money would be used, he says, to reduce in-state tuition at Ohio's public universities, which is about 50 percent higher than at public universities in neighboring states. He has also tried to win over evangelicals in recent weeks by running advertisements in which, holding a Bible, he talks about his faith.
 Further, he has won endorsements from the state's largest newspapers, mostly in reaction to a proposed constitutional amendment, offered by Mr. Blackwell, that would limit annual state and local spending increases to 3.5 percent or the sum of the rates of inflation and population growth, whichever was higher. Critics, including Senators Mike DeWine and George V. Voinovich of Ohio, both Republicans, say this would straitjacket state and local governments' ability to finance needed programs. 
 Mr. Petro has proposed an alternative amendment, which he says would not affect local governments, to limit state tax revenue to 5.5 percent of Ohioans' personal income.
 Whatever the endorsements, ''Blackwell has a formidable grass-roots and church backing,'' said Dr. Green, the Akron political scientist, who estimates that 25 percent of Ohio voters are Christian conservatives. ''The test will be whether he can get them all to the polls now, and again in November.''

HEADLINE: G.M. Cut Loss In Quarter, But Increased Its Inventory 

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 20 

 BODY:
General Motors sharply reduced its loss in the first quarter, providing a much-needed breakthrough for a company battered by accounting missteps and doubts about the fate of its chief executive and of the automaker itself.
 Investors pushed G.M. shares higher Thursday, but analysts expressed concern about G.M.'s inventories, which are at higher-than-normal levels, and about the impact that rising fuel prices could have on the automaker's new sport utility vehicles and pickups, whose success is critical to its turnaround.
G.M. reported a first-quarter loss of $323 million, or 57 cents a share, compared with a loss of $1.25 billion, or $2.22 a share, in the period a year ago. The year-ago loss, originally $1.1 billion, was restated earlier this year, along with G.M.'s loss for all of 2005 and its results for several other quarters.
 Rick Wagoner, G.M.'s chief executive, called the performance ''a significant milestone'' in G.M.'s restructuring efforts. 
 Earlier this month, G.M.'s board issued an unusual statement of support for Mr. Wagoner, after a number of analysts questioned whether he should remain in his job.
 The first-quarter improvement sent G.M. stock up 10 percent, to $22.64, in regular trading; shares fell 4 cents in after-hours trading. 
 The shortfall was G.M.'s sixth consecutive quarterly loss. The company cautioned that the first-quarter numbers were preliminary and could be adjusted later this year as it takes other charges and adjustments for issues like its retiree health care program.
 G.M., which lost $10.6 billion in 2005, its biggest loss since 1992, has been on a push to revamp its operations. Late last year, G.M. said it would close all or part of a dozen plants and eliminate 30,000 jobs.
 To hasten the cuts, G.M. has offered a sweeping buyout plan to all 113,000 of its hourly employees in the United States, as well as 13,000 employees at Delphi, the auto parts supplier that G.M. spun off in 1999. G.M. is liable for pension and health care costs for former G.M. workers at Delphi, which filed for Chapter 11 protection last fall.
 On Thursday, G.M. officials declined to project how many workers would choose the buyouts, which range from $35,000 to $140,000, depending on how many years the person has spent at G.M. or Delphi.
 During the first quarter, G.M. said it took a pretax charge of $1 billion, or $681 million after taxes, reflecting health care expenses for its retired hourly workers.
 The company and the United Automobile Workers union agreed last year on a program that will require workers to pay more for their medical coverage. 
 Long term, the plan will reduce G.M.'s health care spending by about 25 percent, to $45 billion, but the company is required to contribute to a health care benefits fund in 2006, 2007 and 2011. Including a portion of the health care charge, G.M. said it lost $946 million on its North American automotive business.
 That was down from a $1.5 billion North American loss last year. General Motors credited the improvement to strong early sales of new versions of its S.U.V.'s, which it said were selling for up to $7,000 more than the vehicles they replaced. 
 G.M. also said it was spending $1,100 less per vehicle on incentives, in large part because it cut prices on about three-quarters of its vehicles in January.
 But G.M.'s auto sales fell 5.2 percent during the first quarter, when its share of the car market in the United States dropped by 1.6 percentage points, to 24.1 percent, according to statistics from Autodata Inc.
 Several analysts said they were concerned that General Motors ended the first quarter with an 85-day supply of cars, well above the industry average of 67 days, according to Autodata. 
 That is a higher supply than General Motors had on hand at this time last year, when it started a program offering its employee discounts to consumers. Though the program helped empty G.M. showrooms during the summer, sales fell sharply during the fall once the special deals went away.
 ''Watch out for production cuts,'' John Murphy, an auto analyst with Merrill Lynch, said in a research note.
 But G.M.'s chief financial officer, Frederick A. Henderson, said no widespread cuts were anticipated. He explained that General Motors would convert seven plants in Canada, the United States and Mexico to produce its new pickups during the next few months. With those plants temporarily shut, G.M. does not want dealers to be caught short of vehicles, he said.
 ''We think our inventories are quite reasonable,'' Mr. Henderson said during a conference call with analysts and reporters.
 Mr. Henderson said G.M. was concerned about the impact that rising gasoline prices, which have spiked above $3 a gallon in some parts of the country, could have on sales of its new models. But he said that G.M. took higher gas prices into account when it set sales targets for the S.U.V.'s and pickups. 
 The company is not counting on the robust sales that the industry saw in 2002 and 2003, when sport utilities were at their peak in popularity, Mr. Henderson said. 
 He said the better fuel economy of the vehicles, compared with their predecessors, gave G.M. confidence that it could meet its sales targets. Some buyers, he said, ''still want the versatility of a full-sized sport utility.''
 Meanwhile, results fell at the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, the company's lending division, which earned $605 million in the first quarter, compared with $728 million a year ago. G.M. said the drop stemmed from lower earnings at its mortgage finance operations.
 In March, G.M. announced it would sell a 51 percent stake in G.M.A.C. to a group of investors led by Cerberus Capital Management. The sale is expected to be completed by the end of the year. G.M. also sold a controlling interest in its commercial real estate business.
 In one bright spot, G.M. said it earned money during the first quarter in all of its regions outside the United States. That included an $88 million profit in Europe, which Mr. Henderson ran before becoming chief financial officer in December. It was only the second quarter of profits so far this decade for G.M. Europe, which lost $92 million in the first quarter of last year. 
 G.M., which is on a push to become the dominant automaker in China, said it earned $81 million in the Asia-Pacific region, up from $70 million last year. And it earned $56 million in Latin America, up from $31 million a year ago.
 Mr. Henderson said the company was not easing up. For one thing, G.M. expects to fall short of its goal of cutting $1 billion from its costs for materials like fuel, copper and precious metals. 
 Mr. Henderson, meanwhile, declined to say when G.M. would end its string of unprofitable quarters.
 ''There is still a lot more work ahead of us to get the turnaround accomplished,'' he said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Presses Other Nations To Penalize Iran on Arms 

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 21 

 BODY:
The Bush administration called Friday for Russia and Europe to penalize Iran over its suspected nuclear arms program if no agreement on sanctions can be reached soon at the United Nations Security Council. 
 Seeking to press Iran at a time when prospects for Security Council action appear doubtful, R. Nicholas Burns, under secretary of state for political affairs, said individual countries should work together ''for the purpose of isolating the Iranians diplomatically and economically'' if the Council cannot act in a ''reasonable'' time period.
Mr. Burns said the administration preferred to work through the Security Council but, failing that effort, ''it's not beyond the realm of the possible that at some point in the future'' countries would act on their own ''to take collective economic action or collective action on sanctions.'' 
 Despite Mr. Burns's comments, it was not clear that the Europeans or the Russians were interested in establishing penalties without the United Nations Security Council's authorization. European officials, who had to be promised anonymity before they would discuss their countries' stances in such delicate negotiations, said they would resist this approach except as a last resort.
 Some went further, doubting whether actions by individual nations without Security Council backing would be effective against Iran, because Iran could just get what it needed from nations with which it still did business.
 Mr. Burns's comments, at a news conference, came after weeks of faltering diplomacy on Iran, with both Russia and China resisting administration efforts to get quick Council action. Last week, Mr. Burns was in Moscow meeting with French, German, British, Chinese and Russian envoys, but came away without a specific agenda beyond the general need to increase pressure on Iran. 
 But Mr. Burns said there was hope that after a report by the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna next week, most likely finding that Iran refuses to comply with requests to suspend critical uranium enrichment activities, the matter would again be brought before the Security Council in May.
 The United States wants a Council resolution declaring Iran's flouting of such requests as a threat to international peace and security, implying the imposition of sanctions if Iran continued on its course.
 But American and European officials are growing increasingly worried that their pressure on Iran has simply caused it to speed up its nuclear activities. ''In terms of activities on the ground in Iran, it's fair to say, I believe, that the Iranians have put both feet on the accelerator,'' Robert Joseph, the under secretary of state for arms control and international security, said at the news conference with Mr. Burns.
 He cited Iran's claim that it had 110 tons of uranium hexafluoride, a precursor for nuclear fuel in a civilian reactor but also potentially enough for 10 nuclear weapons. Iran's additional claim that it had enriched uranium to a level of 3.5 percent meant that it was on its way to higher levels for use in weapons.
 The Bush administration has sought to organize a widening circle of countries to press Iran, including the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and the so-called Group of Eight leading industrial democracies. But the price of bringing Russia, China, India and other countries into this consensus has been going along with their refusal to consider penalties. 
 In the last two weeks, American officials say they are pleased that at least economic sanctions are being more widely discussed. The week before last, Javier Solana, the European Union's principal foreign affairs envoy, proposed possible penalties on Iran that won approval in Washington. They included stricter export controls on high technology shipments to Iran and revocation of visas for any Iranian officials linked to the nuclear program.
 In addition, the European list implied that there might be a freeze of personal assets for certain officials and a halt in military-related contracts for Iran, which some European countries continue to honor.
 But another senior European official noted that Mr. Solana listed the steps as ''options for reflection'' rather than ''options for action.''
 Mr. Burns also acknowledged that Russian officials rebuffed an American request that Russia halt the sale of antiaircraft missile equipment to Iran.

HEADLINE: A Town Where Wal-Mart Is Most Surely Welcome

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN RUETHLING

DATELINE: EAST DUNDEE, Ill., April 18 

 BODY:
Paul Nicholson was entirely in the dark when a real estate broker asked him last month what was happening with the Wal-Mart store here.
 So the broker e-mailed Mr. Nicholson, the interim village manager, an advertisement offering the store for lease and announcing, ''Wal-Mart Vacating in the Winter of 2007!''
The advertisement, by a commercial real estate firm, was premature, Wal-Mart says, and was pulled almost immediately. But ''the cat was out of the bag,'' says Mr. Nicholson, who was left thinking, ''How could that corporate decision be made with no dialogue or notice to the municipality?'' 
 While community opposition has kept Wal-Mart from opening stores in other places, officials in this village of 2,955 people 40 miles northwest of Chicago want to know how they can encourage the company to stay. They are nervously waiting for Wal-Mart executives to answer questions about the local store, which provides some 23 percent of the village's sales tax revenue.
 ''We're really dependent on them,'' said Michael Ruffulo, a village trustee, who added that Wal-Mart had been a good neighbor, among other things sponsoring community events, over the 15 years or so it has operated here. ''We need to impress upon them how important they are to us.''
 East Dundee is not alone in its dependence. The store here could join the hundreds of Wal-Marts that have shut down over the last 20 years as the company closes older, smaller discount stores and opens larger ''supercenters,'' often in nearby communities competing for the local retail tax base.
 The number of supercenters, which average 187,000 square feet, has grown to a nationwide total of 1,980 this year from 1,066 in 2002, according to Wal-Mart's annual report to shareholders, while the number of older discount stores, averaging 102,000 square feet, has dropped to 1,209 from 1,647. At present, 318 Wal-Mart stores are for sale or lease, the company says.
 Some municipalities have tried to rein in Wal-Mart's ability to shut down and open up. Five years ago in Evanston, Wyo., for instance, the City Council restricted the company's plans to uproot and build a supercenter in a different part of town. The Council required the store to be built behind the existing Wal-Mart, preventing sprawl and protecting businesses that had popped up around the old store and fed off the traffic.
 But the case of East Dundee is different. Its officials fear that Wal-Mart could leave town entirely, moving to a nearby community like larger West Dundee, which already has a big shopping mall and a Target store.
 ''When you have a small tax base, everything is important to you,'' said Thom McNamee, owner of a variety of local businesses, who added that communities were often forced to compete against each other by offering better incentives to lure companies. ''East Dundee's in a poker game. They don't have enough chips to play.''
 Frank Scarpelli, a village trustee in East Dundee, agreed that West Dundee had attracted most of the retail dollar in the competition between the two towns.
 ''East Dundee does not really have in my eyes a true retail-designated area other than probably the Wal-Mart store,'' he said. ''Wal-Mart seems to be loved by us because it's really the only true retailer.''
 That sounds familiar to Kenneth E. Stone, emeritus professor of economics at Iowa State University, who since 1988 has studied Wal-Mart's effects on small towns.
 ''For many small communities, having a Wal-Mart store is a big plus because it keeps their town viable as a retail center,'' Professor Stone said. ''Without question it is bringing to our attention that this could be a big problem when you put all your eggs in one basket, so to speak.''
 Village officials welcomed Wal-Mart with a tax break when it arrived in East Dundee, where its 210-employee store is surrounded by an amusement park, a grocery, a movie rental store and half a dozen car dealerships. Officials say that even before they got wind that Wal-Mart might move, they were discussing among themselves other tax incentives that would encourage business development in the Wal-Mart area. They also say they know of property owners with larger tracts if space is what the retailer wants.
 For now, Wal-Mart is apparently not sure what it wants, though the signs could be considered ominous. ''We are actually in the process of determining what plans we have for East Dundee,'' said John Bisio, a spokesman for the company. ''It could very well be that we would serve East Dundee from a nearby location.''
 To be sure, some in East Dundee would not mourn Wal-Mart's departure. Paul Gray, who owns a music store here, said that his sales had dropped with the rise of competition from big-box stores and that a move by Wal-Mart would probably work to his advantage.
 Joe Zeller, another local store owner, said, ''If Wal-Mart goes, I'd never even notice it,'' explaining that there were now so many other big-box stores for shoppers to choose from.
 Village officials are still trying to schedule a conference call with executives at Wal-Mart's headquarters in Bentonville, Ark., to discuss plans for its store here. Of the advertisement that surprised Mr. Nicholson last month, Jerald Bartels, the village president, said: ''One would want to believe that it's just a mistake, but it was a fairly professionally produced ad. I would want to believe that Wal-Mart would come talk to us about a significant change like that.''

HEADLINE: A Penny for Your Thoughts, and 1.4 Cents for the Penny

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
WHAT happens if a penny is worth more than 1 cent?
 That is an issue the United States Mint could soon face if the price of metals keeps rising. Already it costs the mint well more than a cent to make a penny. 
This week the cost of the metals in a penny rose above 0.8 cents, more than twice the value of last fall. Because the government spends at least another six-tenths of a cent -- above and beyond the cost of the metal -- to make each penny, it will lose nearly half a cent on each new one it mints.
 The real problem could come if metals prices rise so high that it would be economical to melt down pennies for the metals they contain.
 Appearances aside, pennies no longer contain much copper. In the middle of 1982, after copper prices rose to record levels, the mint starting making pennies that consist mostly of zinc, with just a thin copper coating.
 But these days, zinc is newly popular. Rising industrial demand and speculation have sent the price rocketing. Since the end of 2003, zinc prices have tripled. Gold, by contrast, is up only about 50 percent.
 ''What is really new in the commodity world is the extent to which hard commodities have been converted to financial assets through exchange-traded funds and hedge funds,'' said Ed Yardeni, the chief investment strategist of Oak Associates. 
 ''In the late 90's,'' Mr. Yardeni added, ''my hedge fund friends were all experts in technology. Now all they talk about is zinc, lead and oil. There is a lot of money that has poured into these areas.''
 That may mean that a bubble is brewing, but Mr. Yardeni thinks the run is not yet over.
 Asked if the mint had a backup plan for what it will do if zinc prices rise far enough that it could pay to melt down pennies, a spokesman said that such issues were for Congress to decide. Perhaps the mint could go back to making steel pennies, as it did during World War II when copper was needed for the war effort.
 Pennies, meanwhile, are in high demand. Last year, the mint made 7.7 billion of them -- more than the number of all the other coins it produced. In the first three months of this year, the pace of penny production rose to an annual rate of 9 billion -- the highest since 2001.
 Why so many? Perhaps there is now some hoarding in expectation that metal prices will keep rising, but mostly it is an issue of sales taxes, which in most states are added to the retail price and assure that the total price of many items will require pennies to be given in change if a customer pays with dollar bills. That helps explain why the idea of eliminating the penny has gone nowhere.
 So retailers demand pennies from their banks, the banks demand them from the Federal Reserve, and the Fed orders them from the mint. Many of the people who get the pennies in change throw them into a jar, where they may sit for years, requiring the mint to make more and more of them.
 And, at these prices, lose money on every one.

HEADLINE: Group of 7 Chides China on Currency

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 21 

 BODY:
Finance chiefs from the world's most powerful nations on Friday singled out China as a country that needs to pursue more exchange rate flexibility to help restore balance in the global economy. 
 In a final communique and in a separate one-page annex, the finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of 7 turned up the heat on Beijing to let its currency, the yuan, rise.
 ''In emerging Asia, particularly China, greater flexibility is critical to allow necessary appreciations, as is strengthening domestic demand, lessening reliance on export-led growth strategies, and actions to strengthen financial sectors,'' the officials said in the annex on how to solve dangerous global trade distortions.
 The G-7 -- the United States, Canada, Britain, Italy, France, Germany and Japan -- also welcomed a bigger role for the International Monetary Fund as a global currency watchdog at a time of heightened anxiety about a potential dollar fall.
 In their communique, officials cited several risks to a generally sunny global outlook. These included record high oil prices, a threat of protectionist policies and the danger that global trade imbalances could lead to economic upheaval.
 ''We underscored that global economic adjustment is a shared responsibility,'' the communique stated -- a phrase the United States favors to back its claim that G-7 partners in Europe and Japan must spur growth and encourage more domestic consumption to help United States exports.
 The G-7 officials said they ''supported the strengthening of I.M.F. surveillance, including through increased emphasis on the consistency of exchange rate policies with domestic policies'' -- language effectively backing a monetary overseer role for the fund.
 With oil prices topping $75 a barrel Friday, some 23 percent above levels a year ago, the officials urged oil-producing nations to release more information about their reserves, production and inventories.
 Still, they said oil prices had not yet created a flare-up in inflation.

HEADLINE: All Eyes on the Fed as Gas Prices and Inflation Rise 

BYLINE: By Mark A. Stein

 BODY:
OIL prices climbed even higher this week, setting a nominal record on the New York Mercantile Exchange and stoking concern about inflation. After jumping on reports earlier in the week that the Federal Reserve might soon stop raising interest rates, the stock market retreated on the assumption that inflation would force the Fed to continue reining in the economy.

DICEY PRICES -- Led by soaring gasoline prices, the inflation rate spiked last month, and for the first time some analysts detected evidence that volatile energy prices were beginning to seep into the rest of the economy and push up the cost of living generally.
Over all, the Consumer Price Index rose 0.4 percent last month, compared with just 0.1 percent in February. Even the so-called core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices, rose 0.3 percent in March, the largest monthly rise in a year. 
 That was enough to more than offset earlier news that wholesale prices, also excluding food and energy, increased by only 0.1 percent, the slowest pace since November. The mixed signals illustrate how difficult it has become to anticipate the Fed's intentions, particularly as many analysts say the central bank appears to be close to the end of its tightening cycle.
 The Conference Board may show whether these concerns are unnerving the nation as a whole when it reports its consumer confidence index on Tuesday.

CORPORATE BOOM -- Companies as diverse as International Business Machines, United Parcel Service, Google, Wells Fargo and Pepsi Bottling all reported better-than-expected profits in the first quarter, affirming other signs of strong economic growth. As the numbers rolled in, the Dow Jones industrial average rose to a six-year high.
 Even General Motors posted encouraging results, reducing its loss in the first quarter to $323 million from $1.25 billion in the period last year. The year-ago loss, originally $1.1 billion, was restated recently, along with G.M.'s loss for all of 2005.
 The news was not so good at another manufacturing titan, Ford. It said it lost $1.19 billion in the first quarter, dragged down by a $2.9 billion loss in its North American operation, as sales flagged and its latest restructuring effort began. It was Ford's worst quarter since 2001.
 Companies scheduled to report earnings next week include AT&T, Lockheed Martin and Microsoft.

REGULATION ROLLBACK -- An advisory committee appointed by the Securities and Exchange Commission has concluded that thousands of smaller companies should be exempted from significant parts of a four-year-old law that imposed new auditing rules.
 The committee has concluded that the law, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, is too expensive for small businesses. It will propose exempting publicly traded companies with market capitalizations of less than $787 million; that would exclude about four-fifths of companies whose shares trade on public stock markets.
 The change has been championed by the United States Chamber of Commerce and other business groups that have sensed a changing climate in Washington. The law, which has forced companies to disclose hundreds of examples of serious accounting and auditing problems, was adopted in 2002 after the scandals at Enron, WorldCom, Adelphia, HealthSouth, Qwest and other companies.
 The committee is expected to present its recommendation to the full S.E.C. on Monday.

DAY IN COURT -- Jeffrey K. Skilling, the former chief executive of Enron, got a chance to tell his side of the story behind the collapse of the company, which was one of the country's biggest before an accounting scandal in 2001.
 Under often hostile questioning by prosecutors, Mr. Skilling staunchly maintained his innocence and avoided major gaffes. But he also revealed to the jury that he had steered his employees to tell him what he wanted to hear rather than the unvarnished truth about how the company really operated.
 In 2001, for example, while discussing Enron's role in California's newly deregulated electricity market, he said to an Enron lawyer ''We're pure as the driven snow, right?'' When the lawyer told him about strategies that traders had used, many of them later found to have served to manipulate the market. ''O.K.,'' Mr. Skilling said. ''So we're as pure as the driven snow?'' 
 Enron's other former chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay, is scheduled to take the stand on Monday.

SETTLING UP -- J. P. Morgan Chase agreed to pay $425 million to settle its part of a class-action lawsuit that contends dozens of banks cheated investors out of hundreds of millions of dollars from initial public offerings during the 1990's market boom. Of 55 investment banks named as defendants, J. P. Morgan is the first to settle, and its agreement may prompt other Wall Street firms to follow. Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs are among the largest investment houses involved in the case. Lehman Brothers and Citigroup are also involved.
 The size and speed of J. P. Morgan's settlement could add momentum for an overall multibillion-dollar settlement by all the banks involved, lawyers said. 

HEADING OUT -- Sanford I. Weill stepped down as chairman of Citigroup, the worldwide financial supermarket he had meticulously and single-mindedly stitched together through dozens of mergers and acquisitions.
 Before his last appearance as chairman at a Citigroup shareholder meeting -- held at Carnegie Hall, which has named a recital hall after him and his wife, Joan, in acknowledgment of their support -- he went to a party at the Temple of Dendur in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, another beneficiary of his charity.
 Mr. Weill's successor as Citigroup's chief executive, Charles O. Prince III, also succeeded him as chairman.
 Mr. Weill, who earned almost $1 billion in salary, bonuses and options gains over the last decade, will now receive a pension worth more than $1 million a year. He will earn $3,846 a day under a 10-year consulting contract with Citigroup.

HEADLINE: It's Too Easy To Turn Home Into an A.T.M.

BYLINE: By M. P. Dunleavey

 BODY:
THE other day I received yet another teaser letter with a simulated credit card glued to it. On closer inspection, this was not the typical pitch for an ordinary Visa or MasterCard; it was for a J. P. Morgan Chase EquityCard. It functions just like a credit card, except that it would allow me to spend the equity in my home.
 ''Pay off bills,'' the letter exhorted me. ''Make home improvements. Get CASH -- up to $65,621.'' 
I felt my stomach churn at the notion of using plastic -- backed by my home-- as an instrument of payment. I already have a home-equity line of credit with my mortgage lender. Most such lines of credit are variable-rate, interest-only loans -- just about the slipperiest slope a borrower can be on, as I know from the rapidly rising interest rate on my own line of credit.
 Being given instant access to your equity via a credit card would seem like a serious financial hazard, especially because these loans are structured so that the bigger your line of credit, the lower the interest rate. When I called J. P. Morgan Chase to inquire about a theoretical $10,000 line of credit, the representative suggested that I take a $25,000 line of credit instead, because of the better interest rate: 8.75 percent versus 9.75 percent for the smaller loan. 
 A Chase spokesman said there were fixed costs associated with setting up any loan, so the larger the line of credit, the more the bank stands to make. Thus, it can offer a more favorable rate to bigger borrowers.
 Of course, the customer service person reminded me, ''If you take the $25,000, it in no way suggests you have to use the $25,000.'' 
 Easy for him to say. An awful lot of Americans have gotten into the habit of seeing their homes as virtual cash machines. Whereas using a credit card is truly spending borrowed money, cashing out equity can seem more like using funds you (or your house) have ''earned.''
 In 1995, according to Freddie Mac, homeowners cashed out $11.2 billion in equity; the estimated amount for 2005 is $243 billion. Those figures do not include the additional money people have borrowed through lines of credit.
 That may have been fine while home values were soaring and interest rates were not. But the last thing homeowners need now is the temptation to leverage themselves even further with home-equity cards, spending cash that ultimately might not be covered by their home's appreciating value. 
 Genie M. Driskill, chief operating officer at Synergistics Research in Atlanta, disagrees. First, she points out, these cards are not new. About 41 percent of lenders offer them and only about 7 percent of homeowners use plastic to obtain access to their lines of credit. She also feels that most homeowners are cautious about using creditlike cards to tap their equity. ''There is an overriding sense that this is my home, and people are very conservative.''
 According to the Synergistics telephone survey in 2005, the top two ways consumers spend their home equity are on home improvements (56 percent) and debt consolidation (32 percent).
 Ms. Driskill pointed out that fewer than 10 percent of homeowners tapped their equity for something like a vacation. But I don't think it matters whether you spend the money at Home Depot or with a luxury cruise line. True, putting in a new kitchen enhances your home's value, but the danger either way is the temptation to spend yourself into a hole that might be harder to climb out of than it looks. 
 If I signed up for a $25,000 Chase EquityCard -- which I did qualify for -- and spent $10,000 on my bathroom, I would be biting my nails until the property values in my small town had risen high enough to cover the loan, and still give me the profit I'm counting on when I sell.
 Amy Crews Cutts, deputy chief economist at Freddie Mac, says that home-equity lines of credit can be a tremendous blessing for those who need the savings stored in their home in the event of an emergency, like a job loss. But she is concerned about too easy access to that money in the shape of a credit card ''that looks just like every other credit card.''
 ''It's a net plus for the American homeowner to have the opportunity for that credit,'' Ms. Crews Cutts said, ''but it can turn into a nightmare if they aren't able to keep their finances under control.''

HEADLINE: A Wild Week for Oil, Which Passes $75 

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
Oil futures surged yesterday to a new high, above $75 a barrel, capping a record-breaking week on commodity markets. 
 The rise in oil prices, which ended with a $5 jump this week alone, came amid heightened concerns over Iran's nuclear program, interruptions in Nigeria's oil production and fresh fears about gasoline shortfalls in the United States this summer.
While yesterday's price was the highest reached on the New York Mercantile Exchange since oil futures began trading there in 1983, it is still lower than the inflation-adjusted record reached in 1981 of about $85 a barrel in today's dollars. But it's getting close. 
 Crude oil for June delivery rose to $75.17 a barrel, up $1.48. Futures touched an intraday trading high of $75.35 a barrel. Oil prices, up 23 percent this year, have more than doubled in two years. 
 ''It's been a wild week on top of the previous wild week, coming after a wild year,'' said Thomas Bentz, an oil broker with BNP Paribas in New York. ''And it seems like there's no slowing this thing down.''
 The continued gain in oil prices, and fears of inflation that it fueled, helped quiet Wall Street yesterday, with the markets giving up early gains. [Page C6.]
 While there is still enough oil to go around, oil markets remain tight. With worldwide demand at 85 million barrels a day, the level of spare capacity -- or additional oil production that can quickly be brought on the market -- is 1.5 million to 2 million barrels a day, or about 2 percent of total demand. In the 1980's, the percent of spare capacity was in the double digits and oil prices were in the low $20's.
 In this context, many analysts fear that the diplomatic standoff between Western powers and Iran over its nuclear program could spin out of control and affect Iran's oil exports. Iran, the No. 2 producer within OPEC, after Saudi Arabia, produces about 3.4 million barrels a day.
 Adding to the market's nervousness, Hugo Chavez, the president of Venezuela, predicted on Thursday that oil prices would shoot to $100 a barrel if the United States invaded Iran. While that prospect remains distant, it is the sort of headline news that feeds the speculative frenzy.
 In Nigeria, another OPEC producer, rebels have threatened new attacks against energy operations.
 Since the beginning of 2006, attacks by militants in the Niger Delta have forced oil companies to cut production by about 500,000 barrels a day, over 20 percent of output.
 ''You have all the elements to push the price up: high demand, tight supplies, tight refining capacity, interruptions in supplies, geopolitical tensions, Iran, Nigeria, etc.,'' said Roger Diwan, a partner at PFC Energy, an consultancy in Washington. ''The upside is bigger than the downside, so the money is piling in.''
 That has encouraged more speculative buying from hedge funds and other players, according to the latest industry report published yesterday. 
 In recent years, financial investors, hedge funds and long-term pension funds have greatly contributed to the rise in oil futures, which also allows them to hedge against other investments, like currencies, inflation or even Chinese growth.
 The value of speculative investments in crude, gasoline and heating oil markets jumped to $50 billion last week, up from $15 billion in 2003. These figures are just the tip of the iceberg, since they do not take into account the options, over-the-counter traders and positions held by oil traders and brokers or oil companies, for which data is incomplete.
 ''Oil is no longer negotiated between oil companies and consumers,'' Mr. Diwan said, ''but it's become a financial instrument, an asset class of its own.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Judge Backs I.R.S. Ruling Invalidating Tax Shelter, Possibly Aiding U.S. Criminal Case 

BYLINE: By LYNNLEY BROWNING

 BODY:
A federal judge has upheld an Internal Revenue Service finding that a questionable tax shelter known as Son of Boss is invalid, possibly bolstering the government's case against professionals and firms that created and sold similar shelters. 
 The decision on Tuesday by Judge David Laro of the United States Tax Court is the first instance of a court's ruling on the Son of Boss shelter and may be the first court ruling on any of the questionable shelters created in the 1990's that helped wealthy investors shield billions of dollars from taxes.
Lawyers for professionals accused of promoting questionable shelters -- including 16 former employees of the accounting firm KPMG -- have argued that their clients did nothing illegal, noting that no court had found the shelters improper. 
 The 16 former KPMG employees, and an outside lawyer and an investment adviser, face trial in Federal District Court in Manhattan on conspiracy and fraud charges in creating and selling four types of tax shelters, including three viewed by the I.R.S. as close cousins to Son of Boss.
 The ruling this week ''seems to take away one of the defense's arguments,'' said Professor Joseph Bankman, who teaches law and business at Stanford University. 
 But Russell Gioella, a lawyer representing one of the KPMG defendants, said yesterday that Judge Laro's ruling would have no impact on his client's criminal case. 
 To be sure, there is a big difference between finding in a civil court that a tax shelter is improper and proving it in criminal court. 
 Still, Gary V. Mauney of Charlotte, N.C., a tax lawyer who represents investors suing the firms that sold them tax shelters, said that ''the ruling buttresses the government's case that these strategies are not lawful as designed and carried out.''
 The ruling involves Randall J. Thompson, the founder and former chief executive of a day-trading firm in Omaha, R. J. Thompson Holdings. Mr. Thompson sold his firm to TD Waterhouse of Canada in June 2001 for $13 million in cash, not including various bonus and incentive payments.
 Mr. Thompson, through a partnership, first sued the I.R.S. last June after the agency disallowed more than $20 million in tax losses stemming from his use of a Son of Boss shelter in 2001. The case was set to go to trial in Los Angeles on Monday. 
 But Judge Laro granted the I.R.S.'s motion for summary judgment in favor of the government's position that the shelter was invalid. The ruling means that Mr. Thompson owes the full losses claimed, plus a penalty of 40 percent. 
 Calls yesterday to Mr. Thompson and his lawyer were not returned.
 Technically, the judge did not rule on the merits of Son of Boss. The government contends in court papers that Son of Boss lacked economic substance and business purpose, and was ''a sham formed for the sole purpose of generating artificial losses.'' Those are three I.R.S. definitions of tax shelters that are abusive. 
 The term Son of Boss refers to a variety of aggressive tax shelters that closely resemble each other and that are variously known as flip, opisblips and mld, or market-linked deposits, among other names, according to the I.R.S.
 Son of Boss, which the I.R.S. formally disallowed in 2000 and has never considered valid, involves creating artificial losses that are then used to offset legitimate gains. 
 In 2004, the agency offered to reduce penalties owed if investors in the shelter came forward and paid the taxes owed. About 1,200 investors took advantage of the offer, paying $3.8 billion. But some 600 investors did not come forward, with some, like Mr. Thompson, choosing to challenge the I.R.S. in tax court.

HEADLINE: New Labor Group Beginning Drive for Higher Pay

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
In their first major initiative since quitting the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the breakaway unions are beginning a drive to increase the wages of, and perhaps unionize, 50 million service workers. 
 The effort will focus on workers whose jobs cannot be shipped overseas -- hotel maids, nursing-home aides, school bus drivers, truck drivers at seaports and others -- with the goal of assuring them affordable health insurance, retirement security and higher wages.
The new federation, named Change to Win, has been largely quiet since the service employees, Teamsters and several other major unions left the A.F.L.-C.I.O. in July. With their new campaign, called Make Work Pay!, the seven unions in the new federation are trying to gather momentum and public attention in an effort to help workers at a time when wages for most Americans have failed to keep up with inflation.
 ''There are 50 million workers in this country who work hard every day and who play by the rules, but they can't make ends meet,'' the president of Change to Win, Anna Burger, said. ''Our unions came together because we believe we have to organize workers again in our country so they can have a loud-enough voice to have their work valued.''
 The campaign is ambitious -- some critics say unrealistically so -- and starts as many unions are struggling to reverse declines in membership. The effort to unionize millions of workers is likely to face intense opposition from companies.
 Over the next month, the Change to Win unions, which have more than five million members, are planning 40 demonstrations to mobilize support. Next week, the federation will hold rallies in Seattle for port truck drivers, in San Diego for workers at Children's Hospital, in Kansas City for immigrant construction workers and in Chicago to demand higher wages for Wal-Mart workers.
 The new federation kicks off its campaign tomorrow with television advertisements criticizing the gap between the pay of chief executives and that of average workers. 
 The group said yesterday that two cable networks, MSNBC and Comedy Central, had refused to broadcast the advertisement, which says that chief executives' pay increased 27 percent last year, to an average of $11.3 million, while that of most workers languished.
 Spokesmen for the two networks said they had rejected the advertisement because of policies against issue-advocacy advertisements. 
 When the Change to Win unions broke from the A.F.L.-C.I.O., they said it was doing too little to unionize workers. A.F.L.-C.I.O. officials asserted that the departing unions were hurting labor's solidarity and image and were doing little different from its member unions.
 The seven unions in Change to Win are the Teamsters, the carpenters, the service employees, the laborers, the United Farm Workers, the United Food and Commercial Workers and Unite Here, which represents hotel, restaurant and apparel workers. Of the seven unions, just the laborers have not quit the A.F.L.-C.I.O.

HEADLINE: Nigeria Pays Off Its Big Debt, Sign of an Economic Rebound

BYLINE: By LYDIA POLGREEN

DATELINE: DAKAR, Senegal, April 21 

 BODY:
Nigeria said Friday that it had paid the last of its multibillion-dollar debt to the Paris Club of creditor nations. 
 ''Nigeria will not owe anybody in the Paris Club one kobo,'' President Olusegun Obasanjo said in a statement earlier this week, referring to a Nigerian unit of currency much like the penny.
 Nigeria reached a deal last October with the Paris Club, which includes the United States, Germany, France and other wealthy nations, that allowed it to pay off about $30 billion in accumulated debt for about $12 billion, an overall discount of about 60 percent. 
 The government said it paid a final installment of $4.5 billion on Friday, Reuters reported. It plans to use the money it saves to develop the country and reduce poverty.
 Nigeria committed to using foreign reserves, salted away as oil prices soared, to cancel its debt, which had been racked up during decades of military rule.
 The repayment is the latest sign that Nigeria's economy, long hobbled by corruption and dominated by a single product -- oil -- is on the rebound. The banking sector, which was crowded with small banks of questionable reliability, was recently consolidated to form about two dozen banks with stronger capitalization. 
 Earlier this year, two credit-rating agencies rated Nigeria's credit as BB-, which is below investment grade but puts it on a par with developing nations like Turkey, Ukraine and Brazil.
 Debt relief has become a central issue in the fight against poverty. Nigeria, which owed about $36 billion in overall debt, is one of the most indebted nations in the world. With a population of about 130 million, it has more impoverished citizens than any other African nation; per capita gross domestic product stands at roughly $1,000 a year. 
 Yet Nigeria had not been among the nations that have received write-offs or discounts on their debts, as several poor countries have. In part that is because of its reputation for corruption, earned by a succession of military governments that plundered the state treasury, and because Nigeria, with its oil wealth, is seen as being able to pay. 
 Groups that have campaigned for debt cancellation said that the debt Nigeria owed was accumulated under military rulers, and that the current Nigerian government, which was democratically elected and has made fighting corruption a priority, should not be forced to pay. But Nigeria's debt was largely accumulated under civilian governments, and left unpaid by military rulers. 
 Nigeria's vast oil reserves make it one of the world's largest oil producers and the fifth biggest supplier to the United States. Recent political violence in the Niger Delta, an oil-rich region where militants are fighting for greater autonomy, has reduced output by 20 percent. 
 The group, the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, claimed responsibility for a car bombing that killed two soldiers on Wednesday. 
 Earlier this week, Mr. Obasanjo announced a huge development project to provide jobs for Niger Delta youths and build a $1.6 billion highway in the region. 

Wolfowitz Says Debt Deal Is Close
By The New York Times
 WASHINGTON, April 21 -- The World Bank president, Paul D. Wolfowitz, announced on Friday an important step toward providing $37 billion in debt relief to 17 of the poorest countries, most of them in Africa. He said he had enough votes from donor countries on the board of the International Development Association, the bank arm that provides very low interest loans, to approve the measure.
 The 17 countries will begin receiving the relief, worth close to $1 billion a year over 40 years, on July 1. They are Benin, Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guyana, Honduras, Madagascar, Mali, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.

HEADLINE: Labor Deal With Doormen Is Chalked Up to Compromise on Both Sides

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE; Colin Moynihan contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
James F. Berg, the chief negotiator for the city's building owners, said he was still convinced, some eight hours before a strike deadline, that the union representing 28,000 apartment-building workers would stage a walkout. 
 But in the end, about an hour after the initial deadline of 12:01 a.m. yesterday, management and the union reached a deal, with both sides making concessions that they had said they would never make and both sides still able to claim victory.
Negotiators for the city's rental, co-op and condominium buildings had long demanded that their workers accept a one-year wage freeze, as workers at the city's office towers did 18 months ago. Just as emphatically, union leaders insisted that they would never accept wage increases lower than the inflation rate, especially with the real estate market booming. 
 But when the exhausted, yet smiling, negotiators announced a four-year deal at 1:10 a.m. yesterday, management had not obtained a one-year pay freeze and the union had to acknowledge that its raises were lower than the inflation rate.
 ''Every agreement is a process of compromise and both sides did that,'' said Mr. Berg, president of the Realty Advisory Board on Labor Relations, which negotiates for the city's building owners.
 For the union, the biggest compromise was accepting raises averaging 2.1 percent a year, well below the 3.4 percent inflation rate of the past year. 
 Michael Fishman, president of the doormen's union, Local 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union, defended this compromise on wages by noting that management had in exchange agreed to kick in an extra $297 million to the union's health plan during the contract's four years.
 ''It's important to fund good health benefits and pensions,'' Mr. Fishman said. ''Those are just as important as wages. If you don't have good health care, that's money out of your pocket.''
 Mr. Fishman can boast that the increases in wages and benefits, combined, will top 4 percent a year, greater than the inflation rate. He can also boast that, thanks to management's stepped-up health outlays, the union has achieved a central goal of persuading the building owners to drop their demand that the workers begin paying part of their health insurance premiums. 
 Management had demanded that the workers, who now pay no premiums, bear 5 percent of their annual health costs. The industry contributes $9,700 per worker for health coverage, and the accord calls for the industry to increase its annual health outlays by $1,000 each year, rising to $12,700 in 2009.
 Some union members praised the agreement, especially for health coverage. ''I'm happy with the deal,'' said Guarien Estrella, 55, a doorman at 155 Second Avenue between 10th and 11th Streets. ''I think the health care was most important. It costs a lot of money for medical, and we also have families to support.''
 Until the final hours of the bargaining, management's negotiators had insisted on health insurance premiums and a one-year pay freeze. They argued that both were warranted to compensate the industry for making an emergency $175 million contribution to rescue the union's health fund from insolvency slightly more than a year ago. They also argued that they needed concessions because building owners were plagued by soaring taxes and fuel costs.
 In announcing the settlement, Mr. Berg claimed a partial victory because the industry had obtained a six-month wage freeze, though not a one-year freeze. 
 The deal calls for the doormen, handymen, porters, superintendents and elevator operators to receive no raise now, but a 1.4 percent raise in six months.
 The union insisted that this six-month delay should not be construed as a freeze because the raise means an annual increase in each employee's base pay. The workers earn $37,300 a year on average.
 ''We got a calendar wage increase every year, and that was our goal,'' Mr. Fishman said. 
 In an interview yesterday afternoon, Mr. Berg said a freeze was not the essential point. ''Whether you call it a freeze or a delay, we got some delayed increases that made the package economically acceptable to us,'' he said. ''From the employers' standpoint, it's the bottom line that really matters, and the fact is this doesn't provide for anything more than a modest wage increase.'' 
 Ferdinand DeLaRosa, 36, a doorman at 200 East 15th Street, was unhappy about the provision on wages. ''They're telling us we won because we didn't get a 12-month wage freeze,'' he said. ''But a six-month wage freeze isn't winning.''
 Mr. DeLaRosa praised the deal's health and pension provisions, however. The industry abandoned its proposal that less generous 401(k) plans replace the union's traditional pension plan.
 Mr. Berg said that management's decision to drop its demand to have the workers pay health premiums made sense because management obtained something more important: cost containment.
 Traditionally the building owners pay all their employees' health costs, no matter how much they soar, but the accord will, in its third year, for the first time set a cap on how much the industry spends on health coverage. 
 ''The important thing that we got was an absolute cap on benefits in the third year,'' Mr. Berg said. ''One of our major goals was certainty with respect to any future benefit contributions.''
 The Realty Advisory Board's board of directors approved the tentative contract yesterday. Local 32BJ will soon send out ballots by mail to the workers. 
 Negotiators from both sides say they hope the workers will ratify the deal.
 ''To some degree,'' Mr. Berg said, ''there was something for everybody here, which is not unusual in any labor negotiation.''

HEADLINE: McDonald's Earnings Fall; Tax Gain Last Year Cited 

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: CHICAGO, April 21 

 BODY:
The McDonald's Corporation posted its largest quarterly earnings decline since 2002 on Friday, a 14 percent drop that reflected a big tax gain a year ago and came even though customers continued to spend significantly more money at its restaurants. 
 Sales at stores open at least 13 months rose 5.2 percent worldwide, and the United States business was still resurgent, helped by new products, later hours, stronger breakfast business and cashless pay options.
McDonald's executives said more new menu items like a big breakfast burrito are being planned and they promised a big push in China, where the company plans to build drive-thrus at a rapid pace to take advantage of the explosive growth in car ownership and traffic.
 Sales have now risen for 35 straight months at restaurants open at least 13 months, which are the vast majority of its 31,000 restaurants.
 An analyst, Leigh Ferst of Fitch Ratings, said there was no sign of growth slowing anytime soon and noted that McDonald's had both abundant cash and the ability to generate more to finance a variety of initiatives.
 ''I think they have plenty of room to keep the streak growing,'' she said. ''They've been very responsive to consumer tastes and they've improved the restaurants.''
 The next big focus for McDonalds is China, where the company said building drive-thrus was much more expensive but also more lucrative, generating sales as much as 80 percent higher than at restaurants without them.
 The earnings were in keeping with a preliminary announcement by the company last week. Net income was $625.3 million, or 49 cents a share, down from $727.9 million, or 56 cents a share, a year earlier when results were helped by several one-time items.
 Revenue was $5.1 billion, up 6 percent from $4.8 billion.
 The drop in year-over-year earnings was the largest since the fourth quarter of 2002, when there was a net loss of $344 million, McDonald's first as a publicly traded company.
 McDonald's remains under pressure from consumer advocates to offer healthier food, a trend it has tried to lead. 
 A Morningstar analyst, John Owens, called the quarter another solid one despite some continuing problems with lagging sales in Britain. He said the 35-month string of increasing sales ''shows that they're still making progress on this remarkable turnaround.''

HEADLINE: Sabbaticals Aren't Just for Academics Anymore

BYLINE: By HILLARY CHURA

 BODY:
In an age of job hopping, a perk to reward loyalty -- sabbaticals for those with five years or more on the job -- is taking on increased importance.
 Though the academic world initiated sabbatical programs, they have been embraced by the government and the private sector, including companies as varied as McDonald's, Nike, Boston Consulting, Goldman Sachs and Silicon Graphics as well as law and accounting firms. Some companies restrict time off to educational forays and charitable projects, while others encourage everything from beachcombing, family time and travel. Leaves can be paid or unpaid and can last weeks or months.
At Intel, employees are given eight weeks of paid leave, in addition to vacation, after seven years. Catherine Cotier, 49, an administrative assistant, took her first two-month paid sabbatical in 2004. An archaeology buff, she went to the Mediterranean island of Malta to study archaeology and take part in a dig, but she also spent time fixing up her home in Tempe, Ariz., visiting family and beginning the process of returning to school to study anthropology. Ms. Cotier said the respite left her refreshed, centered and ready to start something new at work. She is planning her second sabbatical in four years. 
 About 23 percent of businesses in this country offer paid or unpaid sabbaticals, according to a 2005 report from the Society for Human Resource Management, with unpaid sabbaticals the more prevalent. As a way to retain employees, induce them to work harder or keep them around in bad times, sabbaticals build good will.
 ''In my mind, it is the best benefit, rivaled only by health care,'' Ms. Cotier said.
 While employees are enjoying me-time, their jobs are covered by employees who may not be at their skill level but can learn on the job. Intel's program started in the early 1990's; last year, about 4,400 of 60,000 full-time Canadian and United States employees went on sabbaticals. 
 Measuring return on investment is almost impossible, but companies with such plans seem as enthusiastic as any sabbatical taker. They discount fears that those taking leave will use the time to find other employment. 
 ''A lot of times, people think it's just for the employee, but it is a tremendous advantage that we get as a company,'' said Richard Floersch, chief people officer and executive vice president for worldwide human resources at McDonald's. ''It's re-energizing that lasts more than a day. Depending on what they do while they are gone, they come back even more skilled and talented than when they left.''
 McDonald's program began in the 1960's and provides eight weeks of paid time off, in addition to vacation, after every decade of work. All full-time employees are eligible as well as some at the restaurant level. A leave taker's job may be filled by someone with lesser experience, so the company can evaluate people in new positions without committing to promotions. 
 ''There are no senior executives who do not appreciate the critical importance of keeping your best people motivated and energized,'' said Hugh Simons, chief financial officer for the Boston Consulting Group, which offers sabbaticals to partners every five years. 
 Some programs began as a response to the tight job market in the 1990's, though only a handful of companies seem to have pulled back when the economy tightened. Last year, 23 percent of companies offered sabbaticals -- 17 percent unpaid, 6 percent paid -- according to the Society for Human Resource Management. That number has held fairly steady since 1997, when the group started measuring sabbaticals. 
 A spokesman, Frank Scanlan, predicted that the numbers could gradually increase as companies seek to retain baby boomers who are approaching retirement age and want time off but do not want to sever ties to employers. He said organizations must be cognizant of that, noting it is less expensive to retain an employee than to recruit a new one. 
 Even so, Carol Evans, president and chief executive of Working Mother Media, said that while the issue seems to be coming up more, sabbatical programs are beyond the reach of most American companies. 
 In addition to keeping employees productive and preventing burnout, sabbaticals can also help companies keep their most valued employees in slow times. Rather than lay them off, a top performer may receive reduced pay and a sabbatical until business picks up and he or she can resume full salary, said Donna Klein, president of Corporate Voices for Working Families. 
 ''Companies find they have to be more strategic in the way they make decisions about manpower allocation and staff,'' Ms. Klein said.
 The printing company Quad/Graphics started its program in 1999. Full-time employees who have been with the company for 25 years are eligible for four weeks with pay. The program was created to help longtime employees re-examine their commitment to the company, decide if they want to do something else or transition into retirement. So far, 60 of 12,000 employees at Quad/Graphics have taken the leave.
 John Lill, a 57-year-old manager in Quad's direct marketing group, and his wife traveled to Italy and found relatives in September 2005. He has been with Quad for 26 years and said his adjustment back was easy.
 ''A week's vacation, you have a pile of messages and e-mail, and you just have to get into it,'' he said. ''With my contacts knowing I'd be gone for a month, it wasn't as hectic as being away for even a week.'' 
 Besides, he added, ''living out of a suitcase for a month is wonderful, but I wanted to get back to a stable routine, and I came back completely energized.''
 Some companies require relatively few years of service but are pickier in how they allow employees to spend their time. The outdoor clothing company Timberland, for example, began its program in 2002, allowing employees who had been with the company for three years to apply for a three- to six-month paid sabbatical with a nonprofit group of their choice; the employee must have had a prior relationship with the group. Six employees so far have taken advantage of the program. This year, Timberland will reduce the requirement to just one year of full-time employment. 
 Rose Stanley, benefits manager at WorldatWork, a professional association for compensation, benefits and work-life practitioners, said that since time had become the new currency, employees value days off as much as or more than dollars. 
 ''Companies are starting to see that there are benefits to offering their employees time,'' Ms. Stanley said. ''As they begin to discover and train employees -- managers, especially -- to value that and to see the benefit to that, then they can see how it comes back to them with creativity, rejuvenation and loyalty.''
 Martha Barber, a 52-year-old partner at the law firm of Alston & Bird, took three months and rented a furnished condo on the ocean at Lauderdale-by-the-Sea, Fla., in early 2005. 
 ''I lived there with nothing in mind but to shut out the noise, to get away from our crazy multitasking ultra-scheduled lives,'' said Ms. Barber, who lives in Charlotte, N.C. For three months, she did not read a newspaper, watch TV news or check her BlackBerry. ''I essentially shut it all out.''
 Since 1986, her law firm has made sabbaticals available to its 300 or so partners who have been with the firm for five years. Not including vacation, those in their 30's get an additional month, with an extra month coming each decade thereafter. Partners in their 60's can earn up to four extra months off, plus vacation, per decade. Ben F. Johnson, managing partner, said the firm, which is based in Atlanta, benefited from sabbaticals because they made executives work together.
 ''It encourages partners to develop groups of people who can attend to the client's needs when they are not going to be present,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Democrats Looking to Use New Orleans as G.O.P. Used 9/11

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, April 21 

 BODY:
Howard Dean, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, toured a house on Friday that the Hurricane Katrina floods wrecked, picking up debris, lamenting the federal response and leaving little doubt of the powerful symbolism his party sees in the ruined neighborhoods here. 
 As Mr. Dean's well-covered hurricane-cleanup mission suggested, New Orleans may well become for Democrats in 2006 and 2008 what New York was for Republicans after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, an evocative metaphor rooted in tragedy that can potentially be turned to electoral advantage. 
Where Republicans looked to the imagery of a battered but resilient New York to project a tough president standing up to the dangerous world, Democrats are looking to this city as the symbol of an administration that is at once incompetent and heartless.
 ''It brings back home the notion that there is a difference with the two parties,'' said Donna Brazile, a Democratic leader whose family home was ravaged by the flooding.
 The Democratic National Committee gathered this week on the edge of the French Quarter for its spring meeting. Talk is in the air of staging the 2008 nominating convention here, though that would require scaling considerable logistical obstacles.
 For now, the backdrop has proven politically irresistible to the party. Mr. Dean was one of 100 Democratic committee members who volunteered for community work projects with names like Dems in Blue Jeans, gutting houses, working in parish kitchens and distributing food.
 In the Lower Ninth Ward, Mr. Dean put on a white hazardous-materials suit and, more than a little winded, helped gut a house. He needed barely a nudge from reporters to declare the federal effort here a disgrace that would cost Republicans control of the government.
 ''This is a searing, burning issue,'' Mr. Dean said, ''and I think it's going to cost George Bush his legacy, and it's going to cost the Republicans the House and the Senate and, maybe very well, the presidency in the next election. People will never forget this.''
 Pointing to two abandoned hulks of cars, he added, ''I hate to be partisan at a time like this, but this is why the Republicans are going to be out of business.'' 
 Even some Republicans view the events here as, at the least, politically potent.
 ''There's no question that it has refocused attention on issues of race and economics and the poor and a number of domestic issues,'' said Mark McKinnon, who as Mr. Bush's media adviser incorporated Sept. 11 imagery into advertisements for Mr. Bush's re-election campaign. ''There's a possibility that New Orleans has transformed the politics of the nation.''
 Still, the parallels that Democrats are looking for may extend this week just so far. For one factor, Sept. 11 put the entire nation on edge about the threat of terrorism. By contrast, the hurricane catastrophe was confined to one region. As a symbol, it may be powerful, but perhaps not as enduringly powerful as what occurred in New York and at the Pentagon. 
 As the White House saw in 2004, there are risks to being perceived as manipulating emotional images for political gain. A spokesman for the Republican National Committee, Tracey Schmitt, was quick to accuse Democrats of ''exploiting a human tragedy'' after learning of Mr. Dean's remarks.
 A senior adviser to Mr. Bush's presidential campaign, Matthew Dowd, argued that Democrats were vulnerable to criticism if they criticized the hurricane response without offering their ideas about what to do, drawing a contrast with how the White House responded after Sept. 11.
 ''For Republicans, it would probably have come back to bite them if the only thing they had was the negatives,'' Mr. Dowd said. ''But what was beneficial was we had the right folks and the right policies to address the aftermath of the crises. If it looks like a partisan thing they are just using for an election, it can easily backlash on them.''
 For all the criticism the White House took for pressing the imagery of Sept. 11 in the political campaign, it never backed down. The party's convention in New York was a nonstop blur of invocations of the attack. 
 Since Mr. Bush's victory, his advisers have argued that they were helped by the backlash from the advertising because it drew more attention to the issue that they saw as central to his re-election, a point of view that Democrats have come to accept.
 Ms. Brazile rejected the notion that Democrats were exploiting a tragedy.
 ''We're highlighting the incompetence of the government,'' she said. 
 Ms. Brazile said she never agreed with Democrats who criticized Republicans for using Sept. 11.
 ''Oh no,'' she said. ''We should have used it, too.''

HEADLINE: Scared of Global Warming and Eager to Spread the Fright

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE

 BODY:
''I am terrified,'' Laurie David said between bites of her Cobb salad, avocados on the side. ''I'm terrified. I'm terrified. And fear is a great motivator.''
 Ms. David was talking about her fears of global warming. Not exactly an aid to digestion, but talk of global warming is what she does, as the reigning media queen of the issue. She has chatted about weird weather on ''The Oprah Winfrey Show,'' recently shepherded two TV projects on the issue onto Fox News and TBS, and is the executive producer of the global warming primer ''Too Hot Not to Handle,'' to be broadcast on HBO today, Earth Day. 
Tall, elegant and intense, Ms. David was also the guest editor of the May issue -- ''The Green Issue'' -- of Elle magazine. (''Clean up your act with eco-chic fashion, travel food.'') And she is a producer of ''An Inconvenient Truth,'' a documentary film based on former Vice President Al Gore's decades of research on global warming. The film had its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in January and will be in theaters in New York and Los Angeles on May 26. You might have caught Ms. David (who seems not at all like the TV wife of her husband, Larry David) on ''The Bold and the Beautiful,'' a soap opera. In an episode in January she played herself, trying to talk a shipping magnate into making some changes in his business to cut back on global-warming pollution. 
 ''Yes, that was the low point of my life,'' Ms. David said. ''Not because of the soap opera, but because of my hideous acting. But guess what? I got to talk about global warming on the No. 1 soap opera in the country.'' 
 For the near future, at least, Ms. David has resolved to stay behind the camera, and her latest endeavor, ''Too Hot Not to Handle,'' is a sober documentary, full of leading scientists and statistics explaining how global warming is already upon us. If it's scary, she said, then good. 
 Early in ''Too Hot,'' Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of Geosciences and International Affairs at Princeton, intones, ''We're headed toward a completely different world than the one we're used to.'' 
 The film provides ''a non-wonky'' explanation of what, exactly, global warming is, Ms. David said. When you add junk into the atmosphere, blocking some of the energy exchange between the Earth and space, it traps heat near the Earth's surface, a Stanford scientist explains.
 Besides watching scenes of hurricanes, heat waves and parched fields, viewers learn that heat waves lasting four days or more have almost tripled in the last 50 years; that moderate rains have decreased while heavy rains have increased. According to the film a quarter of the plant and animal species could face extinction by the end of the century, because of global warming. 
 If that doesn't grab you, yet another ''Too Hot'' authority talks about the commonplace ways global warming will be felt: leaves will change color at odd times of the year, ski resorts won't get snow, spring geese will no longer come in the spring. 
 ''And by the way, you know, global warming is good for one thing: bugs and pollen,'' Ms. David said, tucking into her salad.
 ''I do not want to be talking to the converted,'' she said of the film. ''We want to talk to people who say: 'O.K., wait a second. What the heck is this and why should I care? And you know, hey, when my kids come home, we're going to all watch it tonight.' ''
 Her own family is, of course, environmentally correct. Mr. David drives a Toyota Prius, a so-called hybrid car (which runs on both a gas engine and an electric motor) on ''Curb Your Enthusiasm,'' the HBO show in which he plays a curmudgeonly comedian with a tolerant wife. The real-life Davids both drive a Prius, too, and live in Los Angeles with their 10- and 12-year-old daughters. She's a model-thin, sparkly 48-year-old, and Mr. David is 10 years older.
 The Davids are well aware that in some quarters Ms. David is caricatured as a celebrity do-gooder. She was infamously labeled a ''Gulfstream liberal'' in a 2004 article in The Atlantic magazine that noted that she chartered private planes even as she pressed for improved fuel-economy standards. An article in The Hollywood Reporter this week said that Ms. David has become ''a symbol to some of showbiz grandstanding at its most self-righteous.'' 
 Ms. David said she only occasionally uses a private plane and the majority of her air travel is commercial. ''This comes from people trying to marginalize celebrity, trying to marginalize Hollywood,'' she said of the criticism. ''It comes from people not wanting you to be effective. Celebrities who lend their names to causes to raise lot of money for important issues should be admired and not marginalized and made fun of.''
 She grew passionate about global warming, she explained, when her first daughter was a baby. She felt lost and isolated after leaving a hot career of managing comedians, and when she met some big brains with the Natural Resources Defense Council, she recognized her calling. She now sits on the board of the council, which is dedicated to protecting the public health and the environment. 
 Frances Beinecke, the council president, gives Ms. David credit for changing the public perception of environmentalists as somewhat overwrought tree huggers and for playing an enormous role in moving the global warming conversation ''off of the science page and squarely into the middle of American popular culture.''
 For instance, Elle magazine, which reaches a huge audience of avid consumers of the fashionable and the trendy, is ''green'' for May. Roberta Myers, Elle's editor in chief, approached her about being a guest editor, Ms. David said. Vanity Fair also has a ''green issue'' for May, Ms. David noted.
 ''This is her great passion, she knows a lot about the environment, she's the fulcrum for a lot of activity,'' Ms. Myers said of Ms. David. ''It was just important to us that we get her voice.'' 
 Ms. David started her professional life as a talent coordinator for the David Letterman show (which is how she met Larry David) and now juggles her roles as wife, mother and activist from a home office. She travels extensively but generally limits her time away to three days. At 6 p.m., without fail, the whole family eats dinner together. 
 ''I have taken advantage of my husband, to the extent that I even got HBO to do a documentary with me,'' she said. ''He won't even promote his own show, and I'm like, 'Honey, ''Nightline's'' coming tomorrow, and you have to talk to them for a couple of minutes.' He went on Oprah with me, which I begged him to do. He's shy.''
 But you don't have to be famous to help, Ms. David said. Her easy to-do list of suggestions includes buying recycled paper products, unplugging appliances not in use and joining a virtual march on Washington against global warming at www.stopglobalwarming.org. 
 ''I'm completely and totally optimistic,'' Ms. David said of the green movement, betting that she will win new converts when ''Too Hot'' is broadcast. 
 Ms. David called global warming a disaster that must be halted before the crash is too intense. ''It's better to be in a car accident at 5 miles per hour,'' she said, ''than one at 60 miles per hour.''

HEADLINE: AirTran's Scrappy Rise In Atlanta

BYLINE: By JEFF BAILEY

 BODY:
In the battle for Atlanta -- between the upstart AirTran Airways and the long-dominant Delta Air Lines -- routes and air fares are not always weapons enough. 
 Last month, Delta issued a statement crowing that its recent on-time performance had beaten AirTran's. The smaller airline shot back, ''AirTran Airways would like to congratulate Delta on its accomplishment, but why stop there?'' AirTran went on to list other measures of performance -- canceled flights, lost bags, bumped passengers -- on which it said Delta had done more poorly.
 The competition is among the most spirited in the airline industry. It promises to become only more so now that Delta, operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, has reached a tentative labor agreement with its pilots that averted a strike that could have driven Delta out of business.
 Written off as doomed nearly a decade ago, when it was known as Valujet, AirTran is one of the most unlikely success stories in the airline industry. It has eaten into Delta's position in Atlanta, the country's busiest airport, and is adding to its already sizable 15 percent market share there. 
 Delta, said David Cush, a senior vice president in charge of global sales at American Airlines, has ''got a hub on their hands in Atlanta being taken apart by AirTran.''
 AirTran has done it with a sampler of airline strategies. It has low costs, like Southwest Airlines. But unlike Southwest, AirTran offers both business and coach classes, with assigned seating, striving to appeal to business travelers. AirTran has newer planes, like JetBlue Airways, but is not buying so many that rapid growth stretches its financial resources. And like Delta, AirTran operates an old-fashioned hub, with nearly 70 percent of its traffic passing through Atlanta's airport.
 Even if bankruptcy allows Delta to shed some problems -- wages it says are too high, underfunded pension obligations and a substantial amount of debt -- AirTran's growing strength could limit Delta's ability to recover quickly.
 The airlines' battle has been waged mostly with low fares, one big reason Delta piled up $12.3 billion of losses in the last five years. AirTran reported profits in four of those five years, though mostly meager ones.
 AirTran's chairman and chief executive, Joseph B. Leonard, hopes the competition turns less destructive. ''We would much prefer to compete with a profitable Delta,'' Mr. Leonard, 64, said in a telephone interview. ''Delta has run itself into bankruptcy trying to run us out of business. When you're losing $1 billion a year, it doesn't matter if you lose $1.1 billion or $1.2 billion'' by cutting fares to punish a competitor like AirTran, Mr. Leonard asserted. 
 ''If you've got a chance to make $300 million, you work pretty hard to make $350 million,'' he said, and that probably means raising fares rather than lowering them.
 That prospect and AirTran's low costs and steady growth have pushed its shares up about 50 percent in the last 15 months. They closed yesterday at $14.61, down 41 cents. 
 Ten years ago next month, a Valujet DC-9 crashed in the Everglades, killing all 110 people aboard. The airline was grounded by the government for three months. After restarting operations, it tried for a year to restore public confidence. In 1997, it merged with tiny AirTran and dropped the Valujet name.
 Mr. Leonard joined the company in 1999, raised capital and acquired an entirely new fleet of Boeing 717's and, more recently, 737's. 
 Before 1999, he said, AirTran entered some markets, met stiff resistance as bigger airlines added flights and reduced fares on its routes, and retreated with its tail between its legs. That only encouraged the bigger airlines to think they could run AirTran out of a market, he said.
 So, in 1999, ''we made a blood oath to ourselves: if we ever enter a market, we would never withdraw,'' Mr. Leonard said. Mr. Leonard estimated that AirTran, now in about 50 cities, had withdrawn from only four. ''We made our point.''
 AirTran, of course, is not immune to problems. Rising fuel prices are pinching its profits. Increasingly, it competes not just against Delta and other older airlines but also against low-cost carriers like Southwest and JetBlue. And any economic downturn could sap demand for air travel and send the entire industry into a decline.
 Along with JetBlue, which also competes against Delta on the East Coast, AirTran represents the new generation of low-cost airlines: well capitalized, with new planes rather than old, and with service that sometimes exceeds that found on traditional carriers.
 Last Sunday night, David Spurlock, chief executive of EOS Airlines, a new luxury carrier that flies from New York to London, took AirTran from Atlanta to White Plains, he said, sitting in business class. ''It was a tremendous, smooth experience.''
 For the low-cost airlines, growth itself helps keep costs down because new planes and new employees are less expensive than older ones. Low-cost airlines are approaching a combined 30 percent share of domestic air travel and compete with traditional airlines on about 85 percent of domestic routes. 
 And they are forcing older airlines -- Delta, Northwest Airlines, United Airlines and American -- to shed billions of dollars in labor and other costs to compete. Older carriers have also reduced the size of their fleets, cutting supply in the industry and helping all carriers raise fares.
 AirTran operates mostly short-haul flights around the Southeast, but it also flies into the Midwest, New York and the West Coast. In its markets, estimated David Strine, an analyst at Bear Stearns, competitors' capacity in the first quarter was about 16 percent below year-earlier levels. Delta's domestic capacity, the number of seats available, was 13.5 percent lower for the quarter, as it gave up some planes to lenders and shifted others overseas.
 Mr. Leonard of AirTran said, ''All of these things are really helping.''
 After Delta emerges from bankruptcy, Mr. Strine said, AirTran will still have a substantial operating cost advantage. He went on, ''There will be a pricing umbrella for AirTran to operate under and continue to grow.'' He said he doubted that Delta would start a fare war. AirTran's operations are large enough that it can defend itself competitively, Mr. Strine said.
 Mr. Leonard said: ''Somebody wants to come in and lose another $1 billion a year, I guess they can do that. We're still here and the other guy is in Chapter 11.''
 Mr. Strine said he expected profit of about $54 million this year at AirTran, or 60 cents a share, versus roughly break-even results last year. Mr. Leonard would not comment on profit projections.
 Growth also makes for a happier work force that can focus more on customers rather than worry about pay and job cuts.
 The travel manager at a large Atlanta employer, asking not to be identified because the company does business with both AirTran and Delta, said the company's fliers generally preferred AirTran. 
 AirTran operates only 717's, similar to the old DC-9, on some routes on which Delta flies a combination of larger jets and smaller regional jets, the manager said. And AirTran workers are friendly. ''There's just a feeling that they want the business more,'' the travel manager said.
 Delta would not comment on AirTran. A spokeswoman, Chris Kelly, said Delta plans to ''compete vigorously'' after it emerges from bankruptcy. ''Nowhere is this commitment stronger than in our hometown of Atlanta,'' she said.
 Mr. Leonard enjoys the fray. In October, he publicly praised rising fuel prices for ''forcing these inefficient carriers to get capacity out.'' 
 An AirTran ad promises, ''Our planes are newer than most airlines' snacks.''

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence At Risk

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
WALL STREET may be guided this week by a series of round numbers and their effect on another crucial statistic measuring April consumer confidence, predicts Russ Koesterich, senior portfolio manager at Barclays Global Investors. 
 Long-term interest rates are hovering around 5 percent, gasoline is approaching $3 a gallon, and polls estimate that fewer than 40 percent of Americans approve of the job President Bush is doing. That trifecta may result in a confidence number on Tuesday that is lower than the market expects, Mr. Koesterich said.
A Bloomberg News poll of economists expects a reading of 106.2 in the consumer confidence report by the Conference Board, down from 107.2 last month.
 ''Consumer confidence is definitely something to keep an eye on,'' Mr. Koesterich advised. ''We're starting to see some changes in the economy, and the question is how they're going to affect consumers. Expectations are for a minor dip, and my guess is the risk is to the down side.''
 Not long ago, a weaker reading might have bolstered the stock market by reassuring investors that the Federal Reserve's moves to raise interest rates were nearing an end. But that appears to be factored into share prices already.
 ''The market came to that conclusion dramatically'' last Tuesday, Mr. Koesterich said, when the Dow Jones industrial average rose nearly 200 points -- another round number -- after a summary of the Fed's meeting in late March showed that some members of its policy-setting Open Market Committee were concerned about raising rates too much.
 So weaker confidence in April may be taken as evidence that the Fed has overdone it with rate increases and set the stage for a period of weak economic growth.
 ''The economy is leveraged to the consumer,'' Mr. Koesterich said, and a report that fails to meet expectations is a sign that ''the consumer is getting worried.''

DATA WATCH -- Reports on Tuesday and Wednesday will offer clues to the housing market's health in March. The Bloomberg poll predicts a decline in sales of existing homes, followed by a gain in sales of new homes.
 Such a discrepancy would make sense to Mr. Koesterich, who would see it as a sign of a softening market. Individual homeowners are disinclined to lower their asking prices when buyers demur, and their stubbornness shows up as a reduction in sales, he explained. Builders, on the other hand, cannot leave houses sitting empty for too long. ''Inventories and mortgage rates are rising,'' he said, ''so it's reasonable to assume we're going to see a slowdown in traffic.''

HEADLINE: Old Mills That Aren't Run of the Mill

BYLINE: By LISA CHAMBERLAIN

DATELINE: Easthampton, Mass. 

 BODY:
IN urban areas across the country, former manufacturing buildings have been undergoing renovation for some time. But in an outpost like western Massachusetts, the heart of the Industrial Revolution in America, where the economy still struggles and the population has dwindled since its heyday, urban revitalization is just now arriving at the doorstep.
 Old industrial mills built on a system of rivers and canals have dotted the picturesque landscape for 150 years, but now these cavernous hulks of bricks and mortar are in the early stages of being renovated and reoccupied as large-scale mixed-use complexes and residential lofts. In other words, these historic structures are at the heart of a different revolution: the changing landscape of how Americans live, work and play -- and not a moment too soon for the Pioneer Valley.
Easthampton, a town of 16,000 people about 100 miles west of Boston, has been struggling to revive itself for decades, after manufacturing jobs left the area en masse. 
 The first evidence of such a revival, however, seems to have happened almost accidentally. Will Bundy, a mill-conversion pioneer, bought an old Fuller Brush building in 1997 for $650,000 and renamed it Eastworks with plans to turn the space into a cluster of large-scale arts-related industries. It didn't quite work out that way. ''We put off residential until we realized it was the hottest part of the property,'' Mr. Bundy said on a tour of what is now an almost completely renovated 500,000-square-foot mill that overlooks a significant local landmark, Mount Tom. (Mr. Bundy initially owned the property with a partner whom he later bought out.) 
 ''Initially, we were going to only have commercial and rent to large-scale tenants,'' Mr. Bundy said. ''But everyone wanted smaller spaces. Just as soon as we converted some of the space to accommodate smaller users, they immediately began asking about live-work space. So it evolved.''
 Mr. Bundy is now overseeing the final phase of the building's transformation into a mix of ground-floor retail space, a second floor of arts- and industry-related businesses, and a top floor of apartments. He is completing 17,000 more square feet of studio space, as well as 15 more loft-style apartments, in addition to the 32 already built.
 Eastworks is home to an eclectic mix of businesses and residents, from law offices to a comic book collector and illustrator, a fabric designer, photographers and painters, a meditation center and massage studio, a handbag designer, a jeweler, a book collector and a software designer. A vast majority of them could not exist in an outpost like Easthampton without the reach of the Internet to sustain their businesses.
 Julius Ford, who moved to the area from Harlem with his wife, Debora Ferreira, three years ago, knew they wanted to move with their 2-year-old son, Phoenix Ryzen, from their traditional place in Amherst as soon as he saw Eastworks in September 2005. 
 ''It really is the perfect mix of city life and country life,'' said Mr. Ford, an artist and small-business owner, who works from home as an events planner and human relations consultant.
 ''We pay $1,300 a month for 2,600 square feet with huge windows that face Mount Tom,'' Mr. Ford continued. ''But here I have an office at home and a small gallery space, so it's no problem for people to come up and look at my artwork. Downstairs, I can get groceries or go to the restaurant, which is really nice in the winter. And the kids here love it, running up and down the wide factory hallways and visiting with neighbors. You wouldn't think it would be conducive for family life, but it works.''
 Paul Kuhn and Van Outlaw opened their business, Men of Iron, where they make architectural home and garden fixtures in a shop on the second floor in Eastworks. Soon afterward, they moved into a loft apartment that they have since fixed up, while keeping their shop.
 ''I didn't have the imagination to expect that people would become multiple tenants,'' Mr. Bundy said.
 Another development in Easthampton, Paradise One, is a gay and lesbian retirement community that is being planned for an old mill just a stone's throw from Eastworks.
 Heather and Nancy Whitley had been working on their dream of such a community, with high-tech amenities and 24-hour concierge service, for two years when they came across an old mill for sale. The owner, David L. Murphy, had taken over a troubled loan on the building and planned to sell it when he was approached by the Whitleys about becoming the developer for their idea of a retirement community. 
 ''We have a vision, but we're not developers,'' said Nancy Whitley, ''so we partnered with David. We want to augment human caregiving with technology, and develop a retirement community for people who might not have as many family members to help them in their elder years.'' 
 Renovations will begin later this summer on the 120,000-square-foot mill, which will become approximately 80 condominium units. The development, in partnership with Intel, the chipmaker, will offer health-care-related technology, like bed sensors that monitor weight and mobility and send information wirelessly to health workers. 
 Paradise One is expected to open in 2008. 
 Down the road from Easthampton is Holyoke, an early planned industrial city, incorporated in 1850. It was once home to some of America's richest citizens but is now the poorest city in Massachusetts. Built on a system of canals that draw water from the Connecticut River, the city can accommodate 200,000 people but now has a population of only 40,000. Most downtown residential housing is subsidized units for low-income families. Yet, there are rumblings of a revitalization.
 The very first mill built in the area is slowly being transformed into a huge mixed-use complex by John Aubin, whose father bought the property in 1969. Several years ago, Mr. Aubin, an architect, moved from New York City to fulfill his father's dream of bringing the 700,000-square-foot building back to life. 
 Located on eight and a half acres along one of the main canals, the building, which still gets some of its power from historic waterwheels, is now home to 45 businesses, from an educational theater company to a Hispanic-owned bilingual newspaper (42 percent of Holyoke's residents are Hispanic), a marketing firm, a children's furniture designer and several technology-related businesses.
 ''The area is underperforming economically,'' Mr. Aubin said. ''So this would absolutely not be possible to develop on my own without the reach of technology and the Internet. We're recreating a whole community here that could not otherwise exist.'' 
 In addition to setting aside 5 percent of the building's space for subsidized artists' studios, Mr. Aubin is planning residential units as well as a hotel, which he hopes to begin work on within a year. 
 Across the canal from that development is a 50,000-square-foot mill owned by Eric Shuher, who grew up in the area and has been developing commercial real estate in western Massachusetts for years. The mill's renovation will be his first wholly residential project, which he is beginning slowly by first building a model unit to gauge interest and help him decide if it should be rental or condo.
 ''Holyoke is ready to transform itself,'' Mr. Shuher said. ''There's a natural progression under way, and getting market-rate housing downtown is critical.''

TREES LOUNGE (1996)
Tuesday at 7:15 a.m. and Saturday at 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. on Sundance
When Steve Buscemi wrote and directed this wrenching portrait of blue-collar suburbia, he could not have cast a better man in the lead: himself. Mr. Buscemi (above, right, with Bronson Dudley) plays Tommy Basilio, an unemployed car mechanic (he ''borrowed'' $1,500 from his boss and got caught) whose life is sliding slowly into an abyss. He spends most of his time at a bar. He mourns the loss of his girlfriend (Elizabeth Bracco), who is now married to his best friend (Anthony LaPaglia) and pregnant, although the paternity of the child is questionable. Reduced to driving an ice cream truck, he finds himself flirting with an under-age neighbor (Chloe Sevigny) and that's a mistake. 


MASH (1970)
Wednesday at 8 p.m. and Thursday at 3 p.m. on AMC
Robert Altman didn't invent Hawkeye Pierce, Trapper John, Radar O'Reilly and Hot Lips O'Houlihan (Richard Hooker did, in his novel), but his direction and Ring Lardner Jr.'s screenplay brought them to unforgettable life. Hawkeye (Donald Sutherland) and Trapper (Elliott Gould, at far left with Mr. Sutherland) are adorably hip, irreverent, martini-drinking surgeons at a mobile army hospital in this very dark Korean War comedy. (The theme song is ''Suicide Is Painless.'') When it was released, the film seemed like a comment on the insanity and waste of the Vietnam War, and its message hasn't changed. Happily, after all these years, the film's humor still feels daring. Lardner won an Oscar; Mr. Altman took home the Cannes Film Festival's Palme d'Or.

THE AMERICANIZATION OF EMILY (1964)
Wednesday at 8 p.m. on TCM
Speaking of antiwar movies - if you needed an irreverent script written in the mid-20th century, there was no better man to do it than Paddy Chayefsky, known best for his television work. In this sharp, cynical Chayefsky screenplay, directed by Arthur Hiller, Lt. Cmdr. Charles Madison (James Garner) is a World War II American naval officer in London during the buildup for D-Day. Charlie, a bachelor who prizes his freedom, soon falls in love with an Englishwoman (Julie Andrews, above, with Mr. Garner). A widow, she doesn't think much of Charlie's belief that there's nothing noble about dying a hero.

ROCK SCHOOL (2005)
Wednesday at 9 p.m. and Wednesday/Early Thursday at 1 a.m. on A&E
Paul Green, who operates the Paul Green School of Rock Music in Pennsylvania, is not every parent's idea of a dream teacher. He uses four-letter words, tells his students (including Madi, left) exactly what he thinks of their abilities, talks about Satan a lot and jokingly threatens to kill their families if they don't shape up. Mr. Green's approach with his students, he says in this lively documentary directed by Don Argott, is to ''see what they can do once you strip away the fear and the laziness.'' Sometimes the kids are adorable just for trying. Occasionally one of them is great.

HEADLINE: The Bases Are Loaded 

BYLINE: By DAVE CALDWELL

 BODY:
AS recently as 1993, the New York area was a backwater for minor league baseball. After all, it had the Yankees and the Mets, who between them played a total of 162 home games a year.
 There was one minor league team -- the Red Sox in New Britain, Conn. -- in an area embracing Connecticut, New Jersey and a chunk of New York, including Long Island and Westchester and Dutchess Counties.
Last year the Yankees and the Mets drew a total of 6.9 million fans, 2.7 million more than in 1993. But these days 16 minor league teams share that same swath of land, and at least 3 more are on the way, leading some fans to wonder: How much of a good -- and sometimes not-so-good -- thing can even the most ardent baseball fan stand?
 The fact is, New York City and its suburbs have become a hotbed for minor league baseball, saturating the region with more clubs any other part of the country. And if a trip to a Yankees or Mets game is akin to taking in a Broadway play, then heading to a minor league game is like a trip to a neighborhood cineplex. 
 ''It's Hometown U.S.A.,'' said James P. Molinaro, the borough president of Staten Island, which is home to the Yankees' New York-Penn League team. ''And it gives the parent an opportunity to go out and see some baseball with his family without spending $400.''
 Tickets, as well as peanuts, popcorn and hot dogs, are substantially less expensive in the minors than in the big leagues. The best seat in the house for a Staten Island Yankees game costs $11, compared with a seat at the top of the upper deck of Yankee Stadium, which is $20.
 Of course, players in the minor leagues are far less polished than their big-league counterparts, but most people who go to a game already know that. The quality of play is not much better than it is at, say, a local college game. And the age of most of the players is similar. Only one of the 26 players on the current roster of the BlueClaws, the Philadelphia Phillies' Class A affiliate in Lakewood, N.J., has celebrated his 24th birthday. 
 Still, minor league officials like to say they have built an audience by emphasizing the notion that a night of baseball in Coney Island or Central Islip is affordable family entertainment.
 It is an appeal that has resonated. 
 In 2005, the 16 minor league teams in the area drew a total of 3,835,689 fans, or slightly fewer than the record 4,090,440 the Yankees drew last year while playing in a stadium about 10 times the size of an average minor league park.
 While minor league fans will not see Alex Rodriguez swatting a home run for the Yankees or Pedro Martinez pitching to perfection for the Mets, they might get to cavort with a fuzzy mascot or participate in a three-legged race between innings.
 ''If people leave the park without knowing who won or lost the game, then we have done our job,'' said Jim Beaudoin, the general manager of the Connecticut Defenders of the Eastern League.
 Indeed, minor league baseball has become such a cottage industry that it is now regarded as a way to lure families and large groups into redeveloped areas where baseball is just one attraction. Retail shops, restaurants, office space and hotels are often other parts of the package.
 But a minor league ballpark does not guarantee that the area around it will be developed. For instance, KeySpan Park on Coney Island, where the Brooklyn Cyclones, a Mets farm team, have played to capacity crowds since 2001, does not appear to have changed its surroundings much.
 ''If a ballpark is not part of a larger urban redevelopment, it's not going to be successful,'' said Mary-Jane Foster, a real estate developer who with her husband, Jack McGregor, owns and operates the Bridgeport Bluefish, an Atlantic League team in Connecticut. The couple bought the team in December.
 That lesson has not been lost on Mr. McGregor and Ms. Foster, who own one of three Atlantic League expansion teams on the drawing board. In their case, a ballpark in Yonkers is to be the jewel of a $3.1-billion downtown renovation project.
 The two other proposals for the Atlantic League, which was founded in 1998 and is made up of independent teams with no major league ties, call for new stadiums to be built as part of the redevelopment of the Nassau Coliseum property in Uniondale, and in the Meadowlands Xanadu, a shopping center and entertainment complex going up in the Meadowlands Sports Complex in New Jersey
 For now, Steven B. Kalafer -- a developer and owner of about 30 automobile dealerships who at one time had a stake in every team in the Atlantic League except the Atlantic City Surf -- also owns a New Jersey franchise called the Bergen Cliff Hawks, which he planned to have play at a ballpark at Xanadu. But for now, the financially troubled developers of Xanadu have failed to produce a plan for the park, and Mr. Kalafer is suing them. 
 The Nassau County team, which still does not have a name, will be operated by Frank Boulton, the founder and commissioner of the Atlantic League and the owner of three of its teams, including the Long Island Ducks. The Ducks have played to capacity crowds at the 6,002-seat Citibank Park in Central Islip since the league began in 1998.
 Mr. Boulton does not seem to be concerned that his new team will play its home games just 25 miles west of the Ducks, who drew 429,218 to 70 home dates last season. He conceded in a recent interview that the landscape could become too cluttered with minor league teams, but he insisted that point had not yet been reached. 
 As Mr. Kalafer said, ''The region was simply under-served.''
 That is not to say that owning a minor league team in the region is a ticket to success. 
 Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College who is a leading authority on the business of sports, said in a telephone interview that in general, it was hard to have too many minor league teams, since fans prefer to travel only minutes to a game. But he said the New York area might be nearly saturated. 
 ''I'm exaggerating here, but it's a little bit like having a bowling alley in each community,'' said Mr. Zimbalist, the author of ''In the Best Interests of Baseball? The Revolutionary Reign of Bud Selig'' (John Wiley & Sons, $24.95), about the commissioner of Major League Baseball. 
 ''It sounds to me like 16 is too many,'' Mr. Zimbalist said of New York's crop of teams. ''You can certainly have a glut.''
 Take the New Jersey Cardinals, a farm club of the St. Louis Cardinals. At the end of last season, it moved from Sussex County, N.J., to a new ballpark in State College, Pa., where the team will be called the Spikes. 
 Or the Ravens, an Eastern League affiliate of the Toronto Blue Jays, who left New Haven, Conn., for Manchester, N.H., where a new ballpark was completed after the 2003 season.
 ''Yale Field did not have some of the amenities you'd like to have in a modern ballpark,'' said Charlie Dowd, the former general manager of the Ravens, who is now general manager of the Bridgeport Bluefish.
 But just as quickly as teams move to other homes, new ones take their place. Sussex County and New Haven quickly lured franchises from the Can-Am League, another independent league. 
 Those teams have to win over the jilted fans of the previous tenants, of course. ''When a team leaves a city, they're not really anxious to give their love away again,'' said Marie Heikkinen Webb, the general manager of the new team in New Haven, the Cutters. ''We had to earn these fans back.''
 Although the Ducks have always attracted large crowds, some other Atlantic League teams have struggled. The Nashua Pride, in New Hampshire, switched to the Can-Am League during the off-season, obliging the Atlantic League to find a new eighth team to balance its schedule. The new team, the Road Warriors, does not yet have a home field. 
 Another of Mr. Boulton's teams, the Atlantic City Surf, averaged 2,018 fans a game last year at its 5,900-seat stadium, the Sandcastle, and the Newark Bears, owned in part by Mr. Kalafer until late last year, averaged 2,709 at their 6,200-seat home park. 
 And the Bridgeport Bluefish averaged only 3,036 fans a game last season at the 5,300-seat Ballpark at Harbor Yard. Mr. Dowd, the general manager, said the team did not have enough money to advertise last year, a crucial component to success in the minors. 
 Ms. Foster, one of the new owners of the team, said the push is on to make the Bluefish enticing to suburban mothers, who usually make the entertainment decisions for their families.
 ''It has not made money,'' she said of the club. ''But we also believe that it can.''
 Indeed, Ms. Foster says she is so sure of the drawing power of minor league teams that she and her husband plan to run an Atlantic League team in Yonkers starting in 2008. ''We were really amazed at how Yonkers has turned itself around,'' she said.
 At first, the mayor of Yonkers, Philip A. Amicone, simply wanted a minor league park built downtown, surrounded by new shops. But the ballpark plan has become part of a full-fledged redevelopment project for the city of 200,000.
 Even though downtown Yonkers is less than 10 miles from Yankee Stadium and less than 20 miles from Shea, Mayor Amicone says the team will not compete for customers with New York's two big-league teams.
 ''To travel to Yankee Stadium and Shea Stadium costs a fortune for a family,'' he said. ''Now, Yonkers is going to be a place where people want to come again.''
 The project, privately financed, is being overseen by a group of developers including Louis Cappelli, a Yonkers native.
 ''They're trying to position Yonkers as a real city -- a 24-hour city,'' said Geoff Thompson, a spokesman for the developers.
 The 6,500-seat ballpark was designed by George Hibbs -- an architect for the Trenton-based firm Clarke Caton Hintz -- who had already designed ballparks in Trenton and Camden.
 The ballpark in Yonkers includes one design element that is substantially different from the stadiums Mr. Hibbs has already designed: It will sit atop a three-story parking garage that will be used during the off-season and when the team is not in town.
 ''It's not taking up additional space somewhere else in town,'' Mr. Hibbs said.
 As for the park itself, Mr. Hibbs said architects of ballparks are somewhat limited in that they all have three bases and a home plate. The challenge is to make them fit in, he said, as he did in Camden, where the two towers in front of Campbell's Field look like the abutments of the adjacent Benjamin Franklin Bridge, which links Camden and downtown Philadelphia. 
 Mr. Hibbs said the Yonkers site is unique because of its proximity to City Hall.
 ''It's a classic approach for a ballpark now, which is to blend it into its surroundings,'' he said. ''Each one has been designed to fit specifically into its locale.''
 The ballparks on the drawing board for the Meadowlands and in Nassau County will not be in the middle of existing urban areas, but the goal is the same: to draw those seeking affordable family entertainment to a site that also has offices, shops and restaurants.
 In fact, a ballpark was not originally included in Charles B. Wang's plan to renovate Nassau Coliseum, the home of his two pro franchises, the Islanders of hockey and the Dragons of arena football. 
 In addition to a refurbished arena and a sports technology center, Mr. Wang, the founder of Computer Associates, wants to build office towers, hotels, apartment buildings and town houses on the site.
 Mr. Wang and Reckson Associates, his development partner, were awarded the project last month over a rival bid by the owners of the Mets, in part because they added a minor league ballpark to their plan to match the one the Mets proposed.
 When he announced that the Wang and Reckson partnership had won, Thomas R. Suozzi, the Nassau County executive, declared, ''There must be baseball.''
 And so there will be a 6,000-seat ballpark on the Mitchel Field athletic complex at the edge of the redevelopment site. More review needs to be done before construction begins, but Mr. Boulton has already signed up to put an Atlantic League team there.
 ''We didn't want to have baseball just for the sake of having baseball,'' Scott Rechler, the chief executive of Reckson Associates, said in a recent interview. ''We wanted to have baseball in a family-entertainment sort of way.''
 The Meadowlands Xanadu development is no less ambitious. Besides a luxury hotel and office buildings, the Mills Corporation, the lead developer of the site, has vowed that Xanadu will be a 4.8-million-square-foot ''entertainment destination.''
 What Bergen County stands to gain -- if a ballpark is ever built there -- is a team that it truly can call its own.
 ''It's a community builder, it's something that can bring pride to a community,'' said Steve Cohen, the general manager of the Brooklyn Cyclones. ''We realize that not everyone who comes to a Cyclones game is a die-hard baseball fan.''
 As Mr. Cohen put it: ''For every two people who, walking in, are baseball fans, there are two people who aren't. But they leave with a smile on their faces, just like the baseball fans do.''

Leagues of Their Own
 When it comes to minor league baseball, it's hard to tell the teams in the region apart without a scorecard.
 Today, along with Long Island's one minor league team, there are two in New York City, one in Dutchess County upstate, four in Connecticut and eight in New Jersey, representing five leagues. Three of those leagues -- the Eastern, South Atlantic and New York-Penn Leagues -- consist of farm teams of major league clubs.
 The Eastern League is a Class AA league, meaning that its players are two steps from the majors, and the South Atlantic League is Class A, three steps away. Teams in each league play a 140-game season that opened earlier this month. 
 The New York-Penn League is a short-season Class A league, and its teams -- made up largely of players who tend to be younger and less skillful than in a long-season Class A league -- play a 76-game schedule beginning in June. 
 In addition, two independent leagues, the Atlantic and the Can-Am, have teams in the area. Neither has ties to the majors, but big-league clubs often raid independent teams to acquire players. 
 Of the two leagues, the Atlantic, which plays a 136-game schedule that opens this week, tends to have players who have accomplished more as professionals. The Long Island Ducks belong to the Atlantic League.
 The most notable Atlantic League player in recent years was Rickey Henderson, the former Yankees and Mets outfielder and the major league career leader in stolen bases, who played for the Newark Bears in 2003 before signing a contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers midway through the major league season. 
 The Can-Am League, which plays a 92-game schedule that begins in late May, features younger players who hope to impress scouts from major league teams looking to fill the rosters of their farm teams.

HEADLINE: Trans-Atlantic Traffic Lanes Are Getting Busy

BYLINE: By Michelle Higgins

 BODY:
As the peak European travel season approaches, a number of major airlines are adding flights across the Atlantic. 
 Next month, Continental Airlines plans new flights from Newark to Cologne, Germany; Barcelona; and Copenhagen (above), bringing the total of European cities it flies to from Newark to 26. It is also adding flights on existing Newark routes, including to Edinburgh and Glasgow, and Manchester, England. 
With new service from Atlanta to Dusseldorf, Copenhagen, Athens and Edinburgh, among others, by summer, Delta will have more than 50 flights daily to 26 European cities. This summer, Lufthansa plans 227 flights a week from the United States to Germany, site of the World Cup, up from 214 last year. 
 Though the number of British Airways flights is only up slightly from last year, it is using bigger planes on certain European routes. On its three daily flights from Boston to London, for example, it is replacing Boeing 777's with 747's, raising capacity about 8 percent. 
 In all, the number of departures to Europe for June, July and August is rising about 7 percent to 35,223, according to Back Aviation Solutions, an industry-consulting firm, with Delta offering more than any other carrier. The number of seats to Europe is up 5.7 percent. 
 Despite the added capacity, fares are higher than last year. The average roundtrip economy fare from the United States to Europe booked in early April for summer travel was $898, up from $882 in the same period last year, according to Harrell Associates, an air-fare analysis firm. And with demand high, don't count on a major price drop.

HEADLINE: Worried About Noisy Children, and Hedge Funds, Too

BYLINE: By BEN STEIN. 
Ben Stein is a lawyer, writer, actor and economist. E-mail: ebiz@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
FOR my sins, I travel constantly. I enjoy it most of the time, except for going through security lines, which is always hell. But I have come to notice a few new travel horrors that I feel duty-bound to share.
 First, because of the spread of mass prosperity or the accumulation of frequent-flier miles, more and more families with small children are flying in first class. (Don't bother writing to tell me that I am a bad person because I like to fly in first class. I have done my time in coach.) These small children often cry, to their parents' indifference, or, if the children are a bit older, have to be read to and played with at loud volume for five or six hours at a time. Nicht gut.
Second, and again because of the mass prosperity of Bush America (and don't bother telling me I am a creep because I like President Bush and think he's done a great job with the economy -- we do have a great economy, after all), there seem to be renovations in progress at every hotel where I stay. For reasons of sheer idiocy, construction seems to start at daybreak. This is insanely inconsiderate to us as guests, and I recommend long prison sentences for anyone involved. 
 Anyway, as I say, I travel a lot and I keep seeing men and women who are plumb worn out from hard work, early-morning flights, long days on the road and the burden of the BlackBerry, which, though it weighs just a few ounces, is as heavy as a cinder block in terms of how much it burdens its owner with responsibility while on the road. It endlessly occurs to me that I hope the teenage children of these men and women appreciate how hard their parents struggle to keep them in BMW's and whale belts. To me, traveling business executives are among the least-appreciated specimens on the planet, mostly by their own families. I just want you to know, Mr. and Ms. Traveler, that while the airlines don't care if you live or die (and neither does your teenager), I feel your pain. You see, I have a teenage son. 
 Well, this is all a digression. What I really wanted to say was that hedge funds are largely, but not always, a snare and a delusion. Hedge funds -- so called originally because they can hedge, or sell short -- started like gangbusters in the 1960's, died off, then came back with a rush when the tech bubble burst. They came back because they could make money by selling the technology stocks as they collapsed. In those days of ashes for Silicon Valley, hedge funds manufactured money.
 But the long-term record of most hedge funds is not at all impressive. Research by Burton G. Malkiel, a professor at Princeton, and Atanu Saha, a principal at the Analysis Group, found that over long periods hedge funds significantly underperform index funds, like those based on the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. 
 For openers, the hedge funds they looked at -- starting with 604 in 1996 and rising to 2,700 in 2003 as the funds proliferated -- earned less than an S.& P. index fund in the period he studied, 1996 to 2003: an annual average return of 9.3 percent, compared with 9.4 percent for the index fund (and 10.1 percent for a simple stock-and-bond portfolio). But hedge funds also create much more tax liability because they trade so often and have so much short-term taxable income, compared with a tax-efficient index fund. And, as is well documented, they have far higher fees than index funds. 
 It is easy to buy an index fund that charges a management fee of only about 20 basis points -- two-tenths of a percentage point -- of the amount invested. A hedge fund takes an astounding fee of one to two full percentage points of net assets off the top, and then 20 percent of any profits. This cuts hedge fund returns to significantly less than those of broad-based index funds. 
 Dr. Malkiel and Dr. Saha calculated that even if hedge funds earned almost 50 percent more than market returns, the higher taxes and fees that hedge funds pay would whittle away their net return to investors to 20 percent less than index funds.
 Other commentators, including my pal and colleague, Phil DeMuth, say that even these results overstate hedge fund results. For one thing, there is survivorship bias -- always a problem in the back alleys of finance -- because only the hedge funds that survive report at all. If you take into account the ones that fail, the results would be worse. 
 Then there are problems of self-selection, in which only the funds that feel like it report at all, and instant-history bias, in which hedge funds that are brand new and have just had one good spurt can skew all the results. And because many assets of hedge funds are illiquid, the managers can put any price they want on them for any period until they sell them (and maybe even after that). This can be used to greatly underreport volatility because the assets in question can be reported at any price the managers wish, even while comparable liquid assets are gyrating wildly.
 To be sure, some hedge funds do well. Some do incredibly well, but rarely do any of them do incredibly well for a long time. As far as I can tell, in the past few years, almost none have done as well as the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Index fund, the Dimensional Fund Advisors' U.S. Micro Cap Portfolio, Dimensional's Emerging Markets Portfolio or the wildly popular Fidelity Contrafund, all of which cost almost nothing to invest in -- although the Contrafund is being closed to new investors at the end of the month, and its glory days may have passed in any event).
 HEDGE funds, as Phil DeMuth says, are not necessarily a great investment, but they are a great compensation program for hedge fund managers. Warren Buffett, a true god of investments, says much the same thing eloquently in his most recent annual report for Berkshire Hathaway. His estimates of how much of America's corporate profits are sucked out of the system's owners, the shareholders, and diverted to investment managers is breathtaking and depressing.
 So, weary travelers, worry about bad hotels. Worry about parents who will not do a thing to quiet noisy children. And worry about the sad fact that your teenagers probably don't appreciate you. (Have I mentioned this already? I wonder why.) But don't feel bad if you're not in a hot hedge fund. Hardly anyone else is, either.

HEADLINE: Are Rich Politicians Selfless Politicians?

BYLINE: By DANIEL ALTMAN

 BODY:
CONSIDERING the nation's muddled campaign finance system, it's hardly a surprise that voters have taken a shine to a few wealthy entrepreneurs. There is an abiding American respect for people who build and manage big businesses, and rich politicians can also claim to avoid conflicts of interest by financing their own campaigns. But does experience back them up?
 The question is worth considering, said Amitai Etzioni, a professor at George Washington University, given the millions of dollars that candidates raise, even for relatively minor Congressional races. 
''If you are not affluent yourself, then you have to raise that money, and you spend a lot of time on courting people who have deep pockets and then attending to their special interests,'' Professor Etzioni said. ''Those with deep pockets at least can act virtuously if they wanted to. The others can't, because they have to be paying off special interests.''
 That feeling helped to elect billionaires like Michael R. Bloomberg, the mayor of New York; Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister of Italy who last week was contesting an apparent defeat at the polls; and Thaksin Shinawatra, who resigned as prime minister of Thailand this month. Yet some recent research suggests that while wealthy businesspeople in politics may not cater much to others, the markets certainly expect them to take care of their own private interests.
 Mara Faccio, an assistant professor of management at Vanderbilt University, looked at the cases of 109 capitalists and entrepreneurs who were elected to political office in 47 countries. She chose politicians in two categories: those who owned at least 10 percent of the shares of a publicly traded company (which many economists consider a controlling interest), and those who had been chief executive, president or vice president of such a company.
 In a paper published in March in The American Economic Review, Ms. Faccio reported that the politicians' companies experienced a 2.3 percent increase in their share prices, on average, around the time of their electoral victories. If a politician entered the executive branch of government, the effect was larger -- up to a 12 percent lift for companies associated with new presidents, prime ministers and other top officials. 
 ''The results suggest that the politician is acting in the interest of the company,'' Ms. Faccio said in an interview by telephone. ''And the effects were much larger in countries with high corruption.''
 In another twist, Ms. Faccio found that when a politician's company was part of a larger business group where he yielded significant voting control, the share prices of the other companies in the group often fell at the time of his victory. ''The value of companies he controls directly goes up, but the value of other companies in the group tends to go down,'' she said. As a reason, Ms. Faccio suggested that a politician might work to benefit his own company, while leaning on the rest of the business group to supply services to his campaign.
 In the United States, it may take a lot of wealth to buy you independence. According to financial disclosures, about half of senators are millionaires, said Chellie Pingree, president and chief executive of Common Cause, the ethics watchdog group. But virtually all of those senators still raise money for their campaigns rather than paying their own way.
 Ms. Pingree herself ran for the Senate as a Democrat in Maine, losing to the Republican incumbent, Susan M. Collins, in 2002. ''You're spending the majority of your time raising money, so you're either on the telephone all the time like a telemarketer or you're at events,'' Ms. Pingree said. To avoid the fund-raising entirely, ''you practically have to be a billionaire.''
 The experience of legislators running companies may be overrated as well, Ms. Pingree said. ''You take somebody like Bill Frist, whose family made millions and millions of dollars with HCA, the hospital company,'' she said. ''Has he been able to use those skills to reform the health care system? Do we have less of a budget deficit because he's leading the Senate?''
 She added, however, that executive experience might be more important for a mayor, governor or president. ''You could argue that there are times when the skills that make you a better executive in those positions,'' she said, ''are the skills that come from having started or run a business, because it is different -- you're the boss.''
 Professor Etzioni disagreed. ''Politics is really not about good management,'' he said. ''Politics is about taking conflicting interests, conflicting values and building common ground.'' To set the agenda is the right job for politicians, he said, ''not to make the railroads run on time.''
 Despite these misgivings, Professor Etzioni said he would prefer to see a crop of wealthy, self-financed candidates rather than relying on the current system. ''If I cannot get my first-best, public financing, that would be my second-best,'' he said. ''It's not good, but it's a lot better.'' In the current system, he added, ''it's no longer the lobbyists pressuring the congressmen, but the congressmen who solicit for money and favors.''
 Requiring candidates to finance their own campaigns might lead to more accusations that wealthy politicians are buying elections with bombardments of television ads, salvos of direct mailings and an army of well-paid, well-organized troops on the ground. Yet that perception, too, may be wrong. Jeff D. Milyo, an associate professor of economics at the University of Missouri, studied whether wealthier candidates in the House had an electoral edge, with results adjusted for their party's overall advantage and the competitiveness of the district. He found no statistically significant effect.
 BUT in more recent work, Mr. Milyo discovered that riches also made little difference in voting records. ''Even a change as large as a million dollars in wealth one way or another makes almost no difference in the observed interest group ratings,'' he said. ''It's completely swamped by party, the leanings of the district and tenure.''
 So are wealthier politicians really more independent? It's not easy to generalize, even among the relatively small number of billionaires in politics. The direction of Ms. Faccio's research, though, was motivated by one billionaire in particular.
 ''I really dislike Silvio Berlusconi,'' she said. ''It's personal. I'm Ital-ian.''

BYLINE: By Jim Holt. 
Jim Holt is a frequent contributor to the magazine.

 BODY:
Democracy is a wonderful thing. We Americans have been enjoying it for over two centuries. Gradually, fitfully, much of the rest of the world has joined us. Although competing systems may menace it for a time, they will eventually collapse because of their internal contradictions. That is why the advance of democracy is inevitable. And the best the United States can do is to help history along by pushing it on recalcitrant parts of the world, like the Middle East.
But wait. Are we sure that what we are enjoying and promoting is democracy? True, we call it that. But the regimes of the former Soviet bloc also called themselves democracies. Suppose their system had won out -- a possibility that may be hard to imagine now but that was once a source of anxiety in the West. They, too, would have proclaimed a triumph of democracy. But surely, you want to say, their democratic pretensions were ludicrous. When Kim Jong Il refers to his nation as the ''Democratic People's Republic of Korea,'' it sounds like a case of a double positive yielding a negative. Our claim to be a democracy, by contrast, is fully merited. Just like the Greeks who, two and a half millennia ago, both coined the term and invented the thing, we have government by the people. 
 There are two problems with this line of thought. The first is that our form of government bears scant resemblance to what the ancients called demokratia. Tellingly, we hardly recognize the name of its inventor, Kleisthenes. The most distinctive feature of Athenian democracy, as the British political theorist John Dunn reminds us in his forthcoming book, ''Democracy: A History,'' was its ''fierce directness.'' Laws were made by an assembly that every full citizen had the right to attend, address and vote in as an equal. (Excluding women, resident aliens and slaves, that left about 30,000 participants.) The assembly's agenda for each meeting was decided on by a council of 500 citizens, chosen by lot. The only elected figures were military generals, and this was considered the least democratic aspect of the system.
 Our own government, to the Athenians, would look like an elective oligarchy. In fact, it was deliberately set up to ensure, as James Madison wrote in the Federalist Papers, ''the total exclusion of the people in their collective capacity, from any share'' in it. Yet we insist on applying a Greek label to it as an honorific. And that is the second problem. For most of history, ''democracy'' was a term of abuse, connoting the rule of the vulgar multitude. The founding fathers fought shy of it, taking care to use ''republic'' instead.
 Today, democracy is what has been called an ''essentially contested concept.'' We project our various pet values onto it, and then are puzzled that it cannot consistently hold them all. Francis Fukuyama, who has argued that democracy is ''the end point of mankind's ideological evolution,'' refuses to admit the Athenian demos to the club, on the grounds that it failed to protect human rights -- notably, the right of its most famous citizen, Socrates, to corrupt the young and invent his own gods. Others are similarly loath to extend the rubric of democracy to present-day Iran, where elections are held under the supervision of a priestly caste, or to the Palestinian entity, on the grounds that the newly elected Hamas government is a terrorist organization.
 The United States is governed neither by priests nor by terrorists (notwithstanding some overheated rhetoric to that effect) but by professional politicians -- or ''electoral entrepreneurs,'' as the economist Joseph Schumpeter called them -- who compete for our votes. They are said to represent us, but representation is as vexed a notion as democracy itself. Clearly, politicians do not represent us in the sense of being like us: quite apart from some peculiar psychological characteristics common to the breed, they are older, maler, whiter and lawyers almost to a man. Ideally, though, they represent us in the sense of looking after our interests, the way a guardian represents an infant in law. Unlike an infant, we have an intermittent right to replace them with other politicians if we judge them to be ineffective in this representative role. But, owing to a byzantine division of labor, much of what politicians do is hidden away from the public eye. Moreover, in one of the more devastating theoretical arguments against democracy, Anthony Downs observed that most citizens have no economic incentive to learn enough about what politicians do to vote intelligently. Nearly half of American voters acquiesce in their infantilization by not voting at all.
 Should any of this make us yearn for Athenian-style demokratia, where citizens come together on terms of equality to reach consensus about the common good? An innovation in this direction has been proposed by James Fishkin, a political scientist at Stanford, and Bruce Ackerman, a Yale law professor. They envisage a new national holiday, called ''Deliberation Day,'' a couple of weeks before each major election. On this day, voters would gather in groups as large as 500 and hash out issues together, like the ancient Athenians. (Unlike the Athenians, participants in Deliberation Day would be paid $150 each.) If this sort of thing sounds appealing, keep in mind that the right to address your fellow citizens is accompanied by the less agreeable duty to heed what they have to say, and that means all of them.
 If nothing else, the system we sloppily call democracy provides a way to get rid of a lousy regime without the bother of overthrowing it by force. As for its apparent historic inevitability, that may owe largely to the difficulty of finding any other source of legitimacy besides ''the people.'' ''Virtue''? That went out with Plato. ''Embodying the national spirit'' became unfashionable with Hitler, as did ''expressing the will of the proletariat'' with Stalin. True, some rulers continue to imagine that they were chosen by God. But almost no one takes that idea seriously anymore.

HEADLINE: Inviting New Business To the Old World

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN. 
William J. Holstein is editor in chief of Chief Executive magazine.

 BODY:
JOHN BRUTON, the European Union's ambassador to the United States and the former Irish prime minister, says American chief executives are mistaken if they believe that Western Europe is slow-growing or protectionist. Here are excerpts from a conversation:

Q. Are you concerned that we're seeing more protectionism, or even economic nationalism, on both sides of the Atlantic?

A. In Europe last year, there were more takeovers by companies of one country of companies in another country than in any year since 2000. So it's not surprising that there has been the occasional case in which questions have been raised. But if you were to look at Europe 10 years ago, many companies wouldn't have even contemplated making the offers they are today. You could argue that the controversy is a sign of liberalization, rather than the opposite. 
 There is, in every country, a wariness about foreign ownership. But a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development shows that the foreign investment laws in nine countries of the European Union are more liberal than are the laws in the United States of America.

Q. What was European reaction to the furor that prevented a Dubai group from buying control of ports in the United States from a British company?

A. There was a worry that the issue was being looked at not on its actual merit or on genuine security grounds, but rather on broader political grounds. In Europe, we do not feel that political barriers should be put in the way of investments. To have a stevedoring operating entity owned by one foreign company being taken over by another foreign company wouldn't have prejudiced the right of the U.S. Coast Guard or Customs to do all they needed to do to protect security. I have spent time talking to members of Congress about this. Europe is by far the biggest investor in the United States. America should remain a place that welcomes foreign investment. I was reassured. Members said this was a unique case and didn't have broader implications.

Q. How much has Europe invested in the United States?

A. European companies have more money invested in the state of Texas alone than the United States has invested in China and Japan combined. European investment in the United States is by far the largest from any external source. Some 14 million jobs on both sides of the Atlantic are dependent on foreign investment.

Q. Why aren't American executives more interested in investing in Western Europe?

A. They haven't really understood the magnitude of the reforms. France has dramatically reformed as a result of the 35-hour week being changed. The amount that companies must pay in overtime is less than in the United States. And France is spending about 10 percent of its gross domestic product on health care, compared with the United States, which is spending 16 percent. France has one of the best health care systems in the world. It also has undergone major pension reform, raising the average retirement age by two years.
 And in Germany, there has been a major reform of the labor market. Businesses now pay reduced long-term unemployment benefits. In the Netherlands, there's been a major overhaul of disability law.

Q. Why are investors bypassing Western Europe for Eastern and Central Europe?

A. If the European Union had not expanded or had refused to take in those 10 new countries, I don't think American companies would be looking at them. When we take in new member states, we are giving them a guarantee that their citizens can work anywhere in the European Union. Romanian construction workers will be free to work in Britain. There may be some delays and transition periods. But there is a revolution taking place in the European labor market. It's equivalent to what would happen if the United States and Mexico were to merge. In Europe, this isn't just an idea. In Europe, this is actually happening.

Q. Aren't some American companies having trouble in Western Europe -- like Hewlett-Packard, which ran into resistance from the French government over plans to downsize its operations in Grenoble, or Microsoft?

A. Microsoft is having trouble because it is an accused monopolist. The European Union is not afraid to take on monopolists or would-be monopolists.

Q. Have trans-Atlantic economic wounds over the war in Iraq begun healing?

A. There was never any impact on trade and never any impact on investment and reinvestment. In the trans-Atlantic relationship, people are free to disagree. In fairness to President Bush, he has gone out of his way to be cognizant of Europe and the European Union. His visit to the commission, a year ago, was the first ever by an American president. Since then, he has been strong in his insistence on consultation with the European Union. We are cooperating on Syria and Lebanon. We're cooperating in regard to Iran, which is extremely difficult. We also are cooperating on China and the alleged piracy of intellectual property.

Q. But in economic terms, hasn't something changed?

A. In 2004, the United States invested $7 billion in France, almost double what the U.S. invested in China. European companies have accounted for 75 percent of foreign investment in the United States over the past five years. American companies earn more from their investments in Europe than from the rest of the world combined.

HEADLINE: The Not-So United States

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK

 BODY:
AFTER Massachusetts became the first state to enact near-universal health care coverage this month, Robert E. Travaglini, the State Senate president, allowed himself a bit of bravado. 
 ''This is going to be a template for the rest of the nation to follow, and not just this,'' Mr. Travaglini crowed, rattling off a list of recent Massachusetts milestones. ''We did this for same-sex marriage; we did this for stem cell research. Massachusetts is at the head of the curve.''
Ahead of the curve for some, perhaps. But for those sitting in, say, South Dakota, which recently enacted a law that bans all abortions except those necessary to save the life of the mother, Massachusetts might look more like it has gone off the deep end. And vice versa. 
 Such are the political and ideological extremes bubbling up from the states these days. Local legislatures are debating everything from teaching ''intelligent design'' as an alternative to evolution in public schools to financing stem cell research to preventing gay couples from adopting. 
 These debates raise a number of questions. Is the country destined to balkanize into a patchwork of polar-opposite policies? How will this diversity be reconciled? Does it need to be? 
 There have been other points in American history when state laws were radically different, historians say, citing slavery, and then the Jim Crow laws in the South. This could be another time of radical divergence.
 ''I think this is up there among the eras of greatest distance among the states,'' said John D. Donahue, a professor at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. ''It's because we have fairly intense cleavages in values, preferences, points of view among the population, and in some of these areas they do tend to cluster state by state.''
 Consider California, where a bill introduced in the Legislature this month would make the state the first to impose limits on the emissions of all greenhouse gases. Also, California, along with New Jersey, Maryland and Connecticut, has allocated money for stem cell research. 
 And Rhode Island passed a law this year allowing the use of medical marijuana despite the fact that the Supreme Court ruled last June that the authorities could prosecute users of marijuana even when the state allows its use.
 On the other end of the political spectrum are states like Idaho, Georgia and 17 others with constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage. Or Florida, Mississippi and Utah, which effectively ban adoption by same-sex couples.
 In some ways this landscape is a blue state-red state divide, but it goes beyond cultural hot buttons to issues like health care and tort reform. It raises the specter of people migrating to different states because of their policies. Will people move to Kansas, for example, because they want schools that include a critical approach to evolution in their curriculum? Because same-sex marriage is currently not an option for anyone other than Massachusetts residents or people who intend to reside there, some same-sex couples have established Massachusetts residency so they can marry. 
 Certainly, the emergence of strong state stances on social issues like same-sex marriage and abortion reflects a certain amount of political strategy and opportunism. 
 Political parties ''have seen the advantages of cultural wedge issues and seek to inflame them,'' Professor Donahue said. ''We haven't had a rip-roaring depression for awhile and when economic issues seem less urgent, there is more room for secondary issues to become political motivators.'' 
 The federal government's posture on certain issues also spurs action by the states. On some issues, the federal government, under the current and other recent administrations, has imposed far-reaching laws and regulations, said John Kincaid, a professor of government and public service at Lafayette College in Easton, Pa.
 ''There's been a tremendous amount of federal pre-emption of state law in last couple of decades,'' Dr. Kincaid said. He cited federal laws governing consumers, food labeling, class-action lawsuits and the No Child Left Behind education law.
 ''So the states are responding,'' he said. ''I think we've moved from an era of cooperative federalism to an era of coercive federalism in which the federal government is really dictating to the states. That has produced a really activist response of states trying to cope with this.''
 On the other hand, some states appear to feel that the federal government has not done enough on some issues. ''Look what states are doing on global warming,'' said Alan Ehrenhalt, executive editor of Governing magazine. ''Many of them are involved in climate change and that may well force the federal government's hand. Stem cell research -- states are doing that because the Bush administration doesn't want to do very much.''
 This atmosphere has turned the concept of federalism, once a favorite of conservatives seizing on states' rights to buck liberal national laws and court decisions, into an equal-opportunity idea embraced just as readily by liberals -- especially with a White House and Congress dominated by Republicans. 
 That is what Richard Thompson Ford, a Stanford University law professor, argued in an article posted on Slate.com last year. 
 ''Many liberals who haven't yet moved to Canada have indulged the fantasy of a 'blue state' secessionist movement,'' he wrote. ''But the American legal tradition does offer liberals a practical alternative to secession or a condo in Vancouver. It's called federalism, a k a 'state's rights.' Liberals often have a reflexive distaste for decentralization of political power: State and local autonomy strike them as provincial and regressive. But much of the association of federalism with conservative politics is the result of historical accident: There is nothing inherently conservative about limitations on the power of Congress and the executive.'' 
 SIMILAR cycles of divergence have occurred at other times in American history, historians and political scientists said. 
 ''Is it any more extreme than having slavery in Virginia and laws excluding blacks from voting in Illinois when they could in Maine?'' asked Pauline Maier, a professor of American history at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''Not all states march in sync. There's always been a patch-quilt of state institutions and I think it's a fine thing. You can get so much creative legislation. In fact, the variety of state polices has been in many ways a strength to the states. In many ways, states showed a better way of dealing with things and a more just society. In other states, they may have seemed backward for a time, but at least they were isolated.''
 Mr. Ehrenhalt said periods of state assertiveness come ''in cycles and it depends on who's in power in Washington and who's in power in the states.''
 The early-20th century was another time of state activism, historians said. Ultimately, ''much of the New Deal legislation in the 1930's was modeled after state legislation,'' Dr. Kincaid said. In the years before the New Deal, he said, ''a lot of states had old-age pensions that looked a lot like Social Security and workmen's compensation.''
 The crystal ball, then, would indicate that some of the issues enthralling the states will eventually get sorted out nationally in federal legislation. Mr. Ehrenhalt said a ''national standard'' develops that ''tends to be less rigorous than the most extreme state, but farther along than states that haven't done anything yet.'' 
 But don't expect that to happen overnight, or on every issue. Dr. Kincaid predicts ''a significant buildup of policy actions in the states that will get reflected in the Congressional elections'' and over time, lead to federal change. Other issues, like abortion, reside with the federal courts, meaning actions like South Dakota's could have no impact on the outcome. 
 ''There are some things where state diversity works out just fine,'' Professor Donahue. ''When Montana doesn't have any daytime speed limits the effects are fairly minor because Montana has a lot of wide open spaces and it doesn't affect another state. But there are other things, like air pollution, where what one state does makes a difference. On the smaller issues it's O.K. to have differences. On the biggies you have spillover.'' 
 Give it a decade before the spillover gets sorted out, Professor Donahue said. ''If you look through American history there's an ebb and flow of more state autonomy and more federal authority,'' he said. ''Within another 10 years we're going to see another season of centralization and I think we'll have convergence on a lot of issues.''

HEADLINE: Once Marginal, But Now Kings Of the Oil World

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
OIL futures settled above $75 a barrel last week, and analysts blamed the usual cocktail of geopolitics and domestic instability. There was Iran's challenge to the West over its nuclear research program, as well as the seemingly endless conflicts within Nigeria and Iraq. All those countries are major oil exporters, producing some eight million barrels a day. 
 Now, add Chad's problems to the mix. 
Idriss Deby, Chad's president, threatened to shut off the country's production of 180,000 barrels of oil a day by May if Exxon Mobil and other oil companies don't pay $100 million in new oil taxes. The threat was the latest in Chad's attempts to get the World Bank to loosen an agreement that limits how much oil money the graft-ridden government can spend. 
 Chad, which has been producing oil since 2003, isn't a big player on the oil market. And in the not-too-distant past, what happened in Chad was of little consequence to oil traders, analysts or, for that matter, drivers pulling up at the pump. Similarly, the fate of Sudan or Yemen, Azerbaijan or the Congo Republic (the smaller of two countries named Congo), didn't matter much to the balance of global petroleum supplies. There was enough oil sloshing around to make up for any shortfall, anywhere.
 That's no longer the case. In a world where every single barrel counts, the actions of Chad's president could threaten global energy security.
 The world currently consumes a little over 85 million barrels of oil a day. Producers can meet this demand, but little is left over. Only Saudi Arabia possesses an additional 1.5 million barrels of untapped capacity to make up for any interruptions.
 Because the world is pumping at just about full capacity, the global oil market cannot afford the loss of exports from even the smallest producer. And now, even the marginal producer can influence oil prices. Some have realized they have disproportionate clout in the markets and on the geopolitical stage.
 Ecuador, for example, wants a larger share of revenue from foreign oil companies and recently approved a new hydrocarbon law that amounts to a unilateral breach of production contracts. The government itself is under pressure from provincial leaders who are demanding a greater share of the country's oil wealth. 
 Add to that the local industry's frequent strikes -- four, so far this year -- and the investment climate in Ecuador becomes bleak. Last year, a strike interrupted Ecuador's oil exports for two weeks and contributed to a $2-per-barrel jump in the price of oil futures traded in New York, according to Eurasia Group, a political-risk consultancy in New York.
 ''Today's exceptionally tight market gives marginal producers unprecedented power and greater geopolitical importance,'' said Ian Bremmer, the president of Eurasia Group, which specializes in assessing how politics affect oil markets. ''They have the ability to press. They have leverage.''
 According to Eurasia Group, 12 small producers are currently facing heightened levels of political risk, which eventually might curtail their domestic oil production or foreign investment. Taken together, these countries account for over 4.6 million barrels a day of production, 5 percent of the world's total, or more than the output of any single OPEC nation except Saudi Arabia.
 Of course, some of the world's biggest producers have also been facing turmoil. Nigeria, Africa's top producer, has been forced to curb its output by 500,000 barrels a day, or about 20 percent of the country's usual total, because of violence in the Niger Delta since the beginning of the year. 
 Iraq, which pumped 2.5 million barrels a day before the war, is now able to produce barely half that amount. 
 In Venezuela, President Hugo Chavez, encouraged by the high prices, has tried to raise sharply the taxes and royalties on foreign oil companies. That stance has led to much uncertainty about the future of foreign investment there. Saudi Arabia recently foiled an attempt to blow up the country's largest oil-processing plant, a reminder that the kingdom is still vulnerable to terrorism.
 ''Risk is a big category,'' said Alan Hegburg, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ''And there's all kinds of risks. But the United States, just like everyone else, is exposed. For example, we're exposed to a major shutdown in oil production in Nigeria, or a major disaster in Saudi Arabia's oil industry.''
 Eventually, production will increase, demand might slow, and the importance of marginal producers will wane. Then, oil analysts will have to worry only about the long term stability of places like Saudi Arabia, Nigeria or Iraq.
 Meanwhile, they need to remember that even the Congo Republic matters.

HEADLINE: What's That Label? Why, It's a Mongo

BYLINE: By ANDREW ADAM NEWMAN

 BODY:
LAURI APPLE was walking along East Seventh Street near Tompkins Square Park on a recent Sunday afternoon when the white plastic bag on the curb beckoned. She paused and -- to no one in particular -- said, ''There are clothes in there.''
 The bag, tied and completely closed, seemed just as likely to contain foam peanuts or medical waste.
But a moment later, Ms. Apple was extracting women's clothing, including a light green wool-blend Forever 21 sweater (good condition), a short-sleeved Ann Taylor white knit shirt (stained), and a black Victoria's Secret something-or-other with attached pink belt (inexplicable). Ms. Apple dropped the sweater into her shoulder bag, returned the other items and soldiered on. 
 Wait. How did she know there were clothes in the bag? 
 ''I don't know,'' she said. ''I just had this feeling.''
 That bordering-on-clairvoyance feeling came a decade ago to Ms. Apple, 30, a law student who lives in Astoria, Queens, when she began acquiring lost and discarded clothes. The draw is equal parts thrill of the hunt, political response to a throwaway culture and frugality. ''My family has had encounters with poverty,'' said Ms. Apple, who grew up in Johnstown, Pa. When she was 5 her father was laid off by United States Steel and remained jobless for two and a half years. During her 20's, she joined antiglobalization activists protesting the World Bank and encountered freegans -- Dumpster-diving anticonsumerists who aspire to buy nothing. 
 Less rebellious today, she considers herself a civil libertarian and a conservative in the literal sense: she conserves. ''I've always been a little bit fringy,'' Ms. Apple said, her eyes panning the sidewalk as she walked and then stooped to pick up a penny. ''My lifestyle doesn't make sense to some people -- including me sometimes.'' 
 So Ms. Apple was not entirely optimistic when a couple of months ago she turned to the Internet in search of fellow travelers. She discovered myriad Web sites dedicated either to letters and photographs found on the street -- Found Magazine being the most prominent -- or clothes purchased used. But when Ms. Apple trawled for sites dedicated exclusively to finding clothes, the Net came up empty. So recently she started her own, Foundclothing (foundclothing.blogspot.com), where she posts photos of her bounty, lists where and when items were found and occasionally adds personal notes. Her collection spans various cities where she has lived and includes simple knit shirts, chic but prohibitively uncomfortable shoes and a BCBG Max Azria dress (near Prospect Park in Brooklyn, December 2004) that she slips on for job interviews and fancy parties. 
 Visitors are encouraged to post photos of their own finds. (The site has been up about a month, and no one has yet.) Ms. Apple wants those who witness her rooting through garbage to stop giving her the hairy eyeball. Her stated mission: ''To take away the stigma associated with found clothes and also to celebrate these items as free, reused fashions.''
 But can Ms. Apple win over the germ phobic masses? 
 Garbage picking ''requires a capacity to deal with looks that can be more severe than the smells,'' Ted Botha wrote in his 2004 book, ''Mongo: Adventures in Trash,'' which follows collectors who comb trash for everything from rare books to computers to food. (''Mongo'' gained currency in New York in the 1980's as slang for valuables found in the garbage.) 
 While Mr. Botha's wardrobe includes found items, he has never encountered someone dedicated solely to finding clothing. Visitors to GarbageScout.com, started in January by Jim Nachlin, are encouraged to use cellphone cameras to post and view recently spied (and computer-mapped) curbside goodies. No one has posted clothing yet, Mr. Nachlin said. 
 ''Most people are put off by the idea of used clothing,'' said Al Hoff, thrift store maven and author of ''Thrift Score.'' She (Al is short for Alison) views upscale consignment shops as ''gateway drugs'' to the previously off-put. ''Once they get used to wearing someone else's clothing, they get more liberal about it'' and will go to the Salvation Army and even the way of Ms. Apple, she said. ''What's the difference if you buy a used shirt from a high-end consignment store or you find it at the Port Authority?'' Ms. Hoff asked. ''It's the same thing.''
 Still, everyone has limits. ''A lot of people who buy used clothing draw the line at underwear,'' Ms. Hoff said. ''It's a visceral reaction to clothing being next to that part of your body -- it's too intimate, like sitting on a warm toilet seat.''
 Too intimate for Ms. Apple, in fact. ''No underwear,'' she said. ''No. No. No. That's a bright-line rule, as lawyers say.'' Clothes she takes, meanwhile, undergo what she describes on her site as a ''patented found-and-boil technique: Take found clothing item, throw it in the sink, pour in a bunch of soap and then boil.'' The water, while not actually boiling, is as steamy as the tap gets.
 Jack Linard, a chemist with Unilever who formulates laundry detergents including All and Wisk, said that he personally ''would not have any hesitancy'' about wearing something found lightly soiled in the street -- after simply putting it through the wash. ''Body soils that come from a different person are what people really worry about,'' Mr. Linard said. ''And in warm or hot water you're going to get most of the body soils out, though not sanitize it.'' 
 Collectors could get in hot water themselves -- with the law. A New York City regulation prohibits anyone besides sanitation workers to ''disturb or remove ashes, garbage, refuse (including recycling) or rubbish'' on the curb. Violators face a fine of up to $300, but in an e-mail message Matthew LiPani, a New York City Sanitation Department spokesman, stated that as of the fiscal year 2005, only 14 people have ever been fined for that violation. 
 According to property law, ''abandoned'' property generally is fair game, though taking property someone can lay claim to is theft. Ms. Apple said that she only takes something if it ''looks lost, dropped or intentionally put out in the trash.''
 ''If there's a remote chance that the owner is around to claim it,'' she added, ''I don't stretch the rules.'' 
 Does that put her on solid legal ground?
 Ms. Apple, who is finishing her second year at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, shrugged, ''I got a C-plus in property law.''
 For all her scavenging, found clothes make up only about 15 percent of her wardrobe, though she is a dedicated thrift-store shopper as well. But she is hardly freegan and buys more than just socks and underwear new. ''When I get depressed, I like to go buy clothes,'' she said. Her favorite place to shop: Forever 21, with its inexpensive fashions for women hovering at or below the legal drinking age. ''I buy the stuff that's not trendy enough for the 21-year-olds,'' she said. 
 Still, for Ms. Apple clothes off the rack are less interesting than those off the street. ''If there's a philosophy behind this, it's to keep my memory in check,'' she said. ''These clothes are like tab markers for memories. They help me remember certain walks, or where I was living.''
 Imbued with such memories, some of her finds become almost too precious. There is a shirt that Ms. Apple found while she lived in Prague in 1996 that is translucent with silver threads, at once gauzy and bright, like memory itself. Nine years passed before she finally put it on last fall. ''I like it, but it just took me so long to wear it,'' she said. ''I just don't think I wanted anything to happen to it.''

 BODY:
Last winter women accessorized blouses, blazers and bags with $525 boucle flower brooches by Chanel for a look-rich-quick effect. This spring young women can brighten up T-shirts, jean jackets and backpacks with handwoven flower pins made for the Estella children's boutique in New York (212-255-3553). The pins, in five colors, have a dusting of sequins and are an easy splurge at $15 each. The cotton baubles are made in conjunction with Citta, an organization that gives work to unemployed women in Nepal. The money they earn by making pins goes toward health care and education there, which means consumers can help enrich the lives of others, rather than just look rich.

HEADLINE: Heading Off a Culture Clash 

BYLINE: By JILL P. CAPUZZO

DATELINE: TOMS RIVER 

 BODY:
AS fine arts supervisor for this large Ocean County school district, Kim Defibaugh is scrambling to complete 21 different versions of an eight-page survey aimed at sizing up the art, music, theater and dance programs at her schools. 
 She is not alone.
 While school administrators and board of education candidates spent the last week fretting over the passage of budgets or getting elected, fine arts teachers at 2,408 schools throughout the state have had other concerns. The New Jersey Visual and Performing Arts Education Survey, begun earlier this month, is being described as the most comprehensive look at arts education ever done by a state.
 The online surveys, which were mandated by the State Department of Education, must be completed by the end of the month. They come at a time when districts face leaner budgets and there is a new emphasis on test scores in major subject areas. 
 In the detailed survey, arts instructors and administrators are being asked such things as the number of students enrolled in classes like sculpture, photography, ballet or choir; what portion of the school's overall budget is allocated to the arts; the number of classrooms dedicated to the arts; incentives for teachers to pursue professional development; if the school has an artist-in-residence program, and how often students attend performances or exhibitions outside of school. 
 The findings, which are expected to be made public in September, will gauge how well individual elementary, middle and high schools are adhering to a state mandate to provide a well-rounded arts education. As the first step in the broader Arts Education Census Project, the survey will also serve as the basis for identifying model arts programs and establishing a clearinghouse on arts education where schools can share ideas. 
 ''Many people believe arts are important, but nobody's actually measuring what's happening,'' said Robert Morrison, chairman of the Music for All Foundation, a national arts advocacy organization, based in Warren, that is spearheading the survey effort. ''We want to know who has access and who doesn't. Where are the robust programs that others can learn from?''
 Another goal is to determine how much truth there is to the anecdotal evidence that with the emphasis now being placed on test scores, arts education is suffering. Mr. Morrison questioned the long-range value of ''teaching to the test.''
 ''Is proficiency in reading and math enough? Is that what we want our children to be able to do?'' asked Mr. Morrison, who also served as the chief executive of VH1's Save the Music Foundation. ''We don't teach music to make great musicians, or art to become great artists. In an economy driven by innovation and ideas, the skill that is needed is creativity and the best way to develop creativity is through music and art.''
 Rather than punish schools that are not living up to recommended standards, the survey aims to identify gaps where help is needed, according to John Pietrowski, the artistic director of Playwrights Theater of New Jersey, another partner in the survey project.
 ''We understand the difficulties,'' Mr. Pietrowski said. ''Under No Child Left Behind and testing, often times arts programs are being short-shrifted.'' 
 Yet while the survey is not intended to punish districts that are providing mediocre arts education, it could, ironically, end up adversely affecting districts that are doing well. Arts funding organizations like the New Jersey State Council on the Arts and the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation are hoping the survey will help them determine if their grants are being properly channeled.
 ''When faced with limited resources, we need to know where we can have the most impact,'' said David Miller, executive director of the state Arts Council, which annually provides $23 million in art grants, with a heavy emphasis on education-oriented programs. ''The survey will allow us for many years to come to allocate our resources wisely.'' 
 The Dodge Foundation, which donated $80,000 for the art survey and is paying close to half the $300,000 cost of the Arts Education Census Project, gives more than $4 million annually to education programs in the state, with more than one-third of that being aimed specifically at arts education.
 ''We have an interest in knowing where the gaps are in arts programming so we can allocate our funding more effectively,'' said Ross Davis, education program director for the Dodge Foundation. ''We think there are pockets of schools that get all the funds just because they know how, and others that don't get any.''
 At the same time, Mr. Davis said the foundation is not interested in rewarding schools that are neglecting their responsibility to the arts. ''It's not our job to fill in the holes in areas you are responsible for,'' he said. ''We can't contribute to the dysfunction if a school decides its going to cut art and be out of compliance.''
 The visual and performing arts are one of the nine subject areas that have been mandated by the New Jersey's Core Content Curriculum Standards since 1996. The state's commitment to the arts was reinforced last year when the high school graduation requirements specified that students must have one year of fine-arts education. In the past, this requirement could be fulfilled with a practical arts course, like careers, or woodshop.
 The curriculum standards do not specify numbers of art classes, hours or instructors needed to fulfill the requirement, but rather emphasize the knowledge and skills students should have at various grade levels in the areas of art, music, theater and dance. 
 While nearly all schools have separate and defined art and music programs, typically theater instruction is folded into English courses, while dance is taught during physical education. Nevertheless, including these programs in the core curriculum indicates an unusual commitment to the arts, according to New Jersey's acting education commissioner, Lucille E. Davy.
 ''I don't know that across the country, everyone places that same value on the arts,'' Ms. Davy said.
 But at a time when the state is suffering from budgetary constraints, no additional funds are earmarked for education this year, even though New Jersey ranks among the lowest in the country in financing education, with 38 percent of school funds coming from the state. 
 Moreover, less than 3 percent of school financing comes from the federal government -- the lowest in the country -- and 59 percent comes from local property taxes. New Jersey is one of the few states where taxpayers get to vote on school budgets. 
 Throughout the state last week, school budgets were approved in only 52.1 percent of local school districts, the lowest level since 1994, when voters approved 51.4 percent of the school budgets.
 ''Voters are frustrated,'' said Mike Yaple, a spokesman for the New Jersey School Boards Association. ''They've seen state aid for school remain stagnant for five straight years. During that time, costs are going up and in some schools, arts are getting squeezed.''
 With a state-mandated 4-percent cap on increases in school budgets, some school districts chose to place arts-spending items in a second ballot question rather than include them in the overall school budget. Mr. Yaple said such maneuvering is dangerous, since second ballot questions have a higher failure rate and cannot be appealed. Only 33 percent of second ballot questions were approved this year.
 In Cherry Hill, a district that has long prided itself on its arts and theater programs, voters were asked to approve an $4additional million, on top of the district's $132 million budget, to retain 37 teaching positions, including 6 music teachers and 3 art teachers. With a muscular get-out-the-vote effort, the budget and the second ballot question both passed on Tuesday. In nearby Medford, voters rejected an additional $180,000 to go toward reading, math and band teachers in the middle school.
 If Cherry Hill's second ballot question had failed, the district's middle schools would have been left with no instrumental music program, and art classes would have been reduced to 30 minutes.
 ''There's a lot of emotion attached to the instrumental music program,'' said a district spokeswoman, Susan Bastnagel. ''It's been part of our culture for a long, long time. It's a shame it's had to come to this.''
 Most of the state's poorer school districts are designated as Abbott districts and receive about $4.1 billion in state aid as well as additional federal financing, allowing them to provide good arts programs. Likewise, many small wealthy districts try to emphasize on the arts.
 Frank Azzaro, the art supervisor at the Rumson-Fair Haven Regional High School, said the school's vast arts programming ''has always been a pride of the school.''
 As Mr. Azzaro put it, ''The school board believes in the arts and are willing to support us.''
 In Ocean County, Ms. Defibaugh, the supervisor of fine arts , said the Toms River school board has always been supportive of the arts, replacing broken band instruments and adding new classes, like art history and a studio art class. But she said she was concerned that midsize districts, caught in a tight budget cycles, might not be as fortunate.
 ''Art is not a tested subject, so money goes toward English and math since those scores are published in the newspaper and people judge your district on that,'' she said. 
 While recognizing the squeeze on local school districts, Ms. Davy, the state's acting education commissioner, said additional funds are not necessarily the answer. To that end, she said she was hoping the art survey would shine a light on ways to offer innovative arts programming. 
 ''We have to look at the results and see how we might better invest the resources we are investing to address the arts,'' Ms. Davy said, noting that some of the required core art content could be incorporated into other subjects, like math.
 Because the survey is compulsory, officials are expecting 100 percent compliance. Once the survey results are in, the Department of State will take over the job of tabulating the results. The state has hired a statistician who will take the raw numbers provided by each school district, and compare those with other available data -- like population demographics and standardized test scores -- to get a better picture of factors that could be influencing arts programming. 
 Those involved with the project are hoping the survey results will provide the basis for a groundswell of support for arts education.
 ''The findings will allow advocates in the field to rally around some data and be able to say 'We've got to do better,''' said Mr. Pietrowski, who predicted that the survey will uncover ''marked improvement in some districts and backsliding in others.''
 Taking a scientific approach to the arts may seem counterintuitive, but it may be the only way to get a better picture of what is actually happening, said Mr. Morrison, who is coordinating the art survey.
 ''With data, you take the emotions out of the debate,'' he said. ''Without data, you're just another guy with an opinion.''

HEADLINE: Who Is Ronald Rice Anyway?

BYLINE: By JOSH BENSON

DATELINE: NEWARK 

 BODY:
EVEN in the best of times, Ronald L. Rice has a reputation for excitability.
 But now that he is running for mayor, the rail-thin state senator and former city councilman has become so edgy that he can be sent flying into extended bouts of finger-wagging vitriol at the simple mention of a name: Cory Booker.
''Don't you know who Mr. Booker is?'' Mr. Rice asked, glaring at his questioner through thick glasses. ''Coming from out of nowhere with his academic spin? 'I went to college. I'm a Rhodes Scholar. I got a lot of money coming in. If I have a lot of money it means nobody cam beat me.' Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. Money don't vote. People vote. And we know that in Newark. And we know when we're being bought.''
 In some ways, Mr. Rice, 60, has been building toward this moment his entire life. 
 A Vietnam veteran and former Newark police officer, Mr. Rice has served for the past two decades as a public official in Trenton and Newark, and has long wanted to be mayor.
 With Mayor Sharpe James finally on the sideline after announcing last month that he would not seek re-election to a sixth term, Mr. Rice jumped into this year's race, only to find himself in the path of a political juggernaut.
 That would be Mr. Booker, 36, a graduate of Stanford and Yale Law School by way of Harrington Park, in Bergen County, who has become something of a national political celebrity. Since losing a bitterly fought race to Mr. James in 2002 -- his campaign was later celebrated in the Oscar-nominated documentary ''Street Fight'' -- Mr. Booker has built up enough support this time around to hold a 43-percentage-point lead over Mr. Rice, according to a recent poll by The Star-Ledger. 
 So far, he has raised $6 million in campaign funds from a donor list studded with famous names. And unlike the last time, Mr. Booker is being supported by much of Newark's political establishment. 
 Mr. Booker's political formidability is such that when the mayor finally dropped out of the race March 27, it seemed to many longtime observers of Newark politics that Mr. James was bowing to something inevitable -- a long-awaited changing of the generational guard. And Mr. Rice's belated entry into the contest as a last-gasp champion of the old guard has hardly altered that feeling.
 ''Ron Rice is in a bind,'' said Walter Fields, a former political director of the N.A.A.C.P. ''I think time has elapsed his opportunity. He is on the trailing edge of a generation that is now seeing their exit from the political scene, and he is, unfortunately a victim of timing. Probably his best chance at seeing City Hall as mayor was 15 or 20 years ago. But politics is all about timing, and his is terrible.''
 So why is he running?
 As Mr. Fields views the situation, it is just something Mr. Rice has wanted to do for a long time. ''I think Ron's always had an aspiration to be mayor,'' he said. ''Anyone who sits on the City Council at one time envisions themselves as being the mayor. I don't think they lose that sentiment even when the odds are against them, and I think he feels he has some claim as a candidate because of his long public service.''
 Mr. Rice ran for mayor in 1998, losing by a lopsided margin to his on-again-off-again ally, Mr. James. He says he is motivated to make his latest run to avert what he paints as a takeover of Newark by hostile conservatives in other parts of the country using Mr. Booker as their proxy.
 ''We're George Washington's army,'' Mr. Rice said in an interview in his storefront campaign office on South Orange Avenue, reaching for what has become his favorite historical analogy in this campaign. ''Like I told you. Just like the British came in well equipped, the British came in looking good and organized, the George Washington army had a cause to fight for. It was to save America from the grip of the British. Newarkers have a cause to fight for, and it is to save Newark from the grips of big-money people from Arkansas and all those places we talked about, the far-right of the Republican Party.'' 
 The well-worn racially tinged theme of protecting Newark from outsiders that Mr. James used to such good effect in 2002 comes easily to Mr. Rice, whose lifelong connection to the community and local-boy-made-good biography is inarguably strong. He is a decorated Marine Corps veteran, a graduate of the Rutgers University School of Criminal Justice and a former police detective. 
 It is a fact that Mr. Booker moved to Newark less than a decade ago when he ran for City Council, and that he has attracted financial support from a diverse group of donors made up largely of non-Newark residents that includes some conservatives. But Mr. Rice has had a hard time articulating a clear policy rationale for his candidacy in the May 9 election, and listening to him can at times seem like being in a time warp as he returns to the rhetorical flourishes the mayor employed against Mr. Booker four years ago.
 ''What's he running for?'' Mr. Rice asked, without waiting for an answer. ''Where's he running to? Or where's he running from? But nobody want to know. The media says, 'But don't talk about that. That's not important.' Well, you know what? To you it's not important but to the people that have to live here, it is very important because the biggest mistake we can make is to turn this city over to someone who is not worthy.''
 He said voters were constantly telling him, ''You can't let him in here.'' He added that ''some people'' have told him that Mr. Booker, a light-complexioned African-American running in a city more than 80 percent minority, looks strange. ''You know, in terms of his eyes,'' Mr. Rice said.
 Mr. Booker, who has largely ignored Mr. Rice since Mr. James's decision not to run again, could not resist going after the senator recently over his campaign's relentlessly personal focus. ''All I've heard from him in public forums is that he agrees with all my policies,'' he told reporters at a public event last week. ''His problems with me are issues of personality. It's all personal. To me, it has not been an adequate discussion of issues. I've heard him talk about 27-point plans and 10-point plans, but I haven't seen anything in print.''
 To a certain extent, Mr. Rice does not disagree. Asked what his differences were with Mr. Booker on issues that have arisen in Newark's nonpartisan election, Mr. Rice paused. ''The issues?'' he said. ''Well No. 1, you don't have the C.E.O. of a major corporation just come out of college. O.K.? So it's a matter of experience, No. 1.''
 Reminded that the question was about policy issues, Mr. Rice said: ''Well, I think that he doesn't know how to treat crime. He has an approach that has no real substance to it. I have the experience and know how to make it happen.'' 
 Although Mr. Booker has yet to say how much many of his proposals would cost, he has said how he would deal with issues like policing and, more controversially, education, where his support for vouchers and charter schools has fueled opponents' accusations that he is a closet right-winger. 
 By contrast, Mr. Rice, who has a long record of policymaking from his State Senate years, has talked almost exclusively in generic terms about his experience. With even the most optimistic voters here keenly aware of the city's problems of crime, unemployment and failing schools, it is a risky strategy. ''I don't think you can really campaign on the platform of 'I'm not the other guy' when you haven't really defined yourself,'' Mr. Fields said. Such a consideration is a nonissue to Mr. Rice as he gearsup for an in-the-streets campaign that he insists will close the yawning gap in the polls. He belatedly has the trappings of a functioning campaign: sound trucks, phone banks, two campaign offices stocked with snacks for volunteers and several experienced political operatives aligned with four City Council members who were aligned with the mayor and are now running with Mr. Rice. 
 Mr. Rice has the enthusiastic backing of the 5,000-member Newark teachers union because of the vouchers issue, which he staunchly opposes. However belatedly, he appears to have Mr. James's support. He said last week for the first time that he intended to endorse his deputy mayor.
 So even though Mr. Booker now has the support of most of the city's major unions, three incumbent council members, the city's best-known get-out-the-vote field coordinator and the state's most accomplished Democratic media firm, Mr. Rice is not ready to concede.
 ''I'm not an underdog,'' he said, angrily dismissing the notion as more spin from the Booker campaign. ''See, he keeps painting me as the underdog. That's not what the telephones are telling us. That's not what the streets are telling us.'' 
 Most important, he said, he had a plan.
 ''I'm taking it right to people and taking it to Booker,'' he said. ''I'm going to smoke him out. He's going to come out there talking negative about me? He's going to come out there trying to defend himself. But somehow I'm getting him out of his cubbyhole, because I know the real Cory Booker and the real Cory Booker story. And the real Cory Booker story will be told.''

HEADLINE: Cory Booker for Mayor

 BODY:
On May 9, when Newark's voters go to the polls, the curtain will drop on the memorable and controversial reign of Sharpe James. For the first time since 1986, Mr. James is not on the ballot in Newark's mayoral election. 
 We believe that Newark's new leader should be Cory Booker, who is running for mayor for the second time. 
 Four years ago, as a 32-year-old rookie councilman, Mr. Booker took on Mr. James in a fierce but vain battle that inspired an Oscar-nominated documentary feature called, with good reason, ''Street Fight.'' Mr. Booker was subjected to race-based taunting and worse, but still managed to give Mr. James a scare.
 There was never any question that Mr. Booker would try again. But the much-awaited sequel has a late-breaking plot twist: Mr. James's decision, announced several weeks ago, not to seek a sixth term. Mr. Booker's chief adversary thus became not the incumbent but the incumbent's former deputy, State Senator Ronald Rice.
 Mr. Rice planned to run only if Mr. James retired. So, while Mr. James was making up his mind, Mr. Rice waited on the sidelines. He has had little time to mount an effective campaign. His fund-raising has barely broken six figures, while Mr. Booker's treasury has grown to more than $4 million. Mr. Rice cannot explain clearly where he differs with Mr. Booker, except to say that he believes Mr. Booker speaks too negatively about the city.
 If that's so, Mr. Booker has much material from which to draw. While Newark under Mayor James boasted of being the nation's Renaissance City, the city's undeniable successes strain under the continued burdens of crime, poverty, poorly performing schools and corruption.
 Even as suburbanites file up and down the McCarter Highway on their way to the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, even as young New Yorkers flock to the vibrant shops and restaurants of the Ironbound neighborhood, even as students by the tens of thousands trudge to class at places like Rutgers-Newark, Seton Hall Law School and the New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark remains desperately in need of leadership, economic development and new ideas. 
 About 30 percent of the city's residents live below the poverty line. Unemployment rates -- 12 percent overall, greater for those in their late teens and early 20's -- and school dropout rates are alarmingly high.
 Mr. Booker rightly asserts that these figures are unacceptable. Likewise, so is the upsurge in violent crime and violence in the public schools. Murders increased from 83 in 2003 to 97 last year. A recent killing on Halsey Street -- carried out, police say, by a man who said he wanted to celebrate his birthday by shooting somebody -- was a chilling reminder that Newark still can be a dangerous place.
 To combat both the sad realities and the even worse perceptions of his adopted city, Mr. Booker, a native of Bergen County, has offered several hard-headed recommendations:
 He says he will put more police on the street, and vows to adopt technology to bring crime under control, as New York did with the Comstat crime-tracking program. He makes a strong case that the city's Police Department is top-heavy with managers chosen more for their political connections than their competence.
 He will bring policy experts to City Hall, rather than rely on political patronage and cronyism, in an effort to lure new investment to a city blessed with first-rate mass transportation connections to New York.
 He will put an end to fire sales of city-owned property to politically connected developers.
 Not all of Mr. Booker's ideas are equally compelling. For example, he refuses to rule out vouchers as part of his remedy for Newark's schools. He now notes with care that he supports vouchers financed with private, not public, dollars. But the next mayor should be devoting his energy to fixing the public schools, and not be sidetracked by schemes that would at best rescue a small fraction of the needy students. 
 Mr. Booker himself remains something of a question mark. His political career, after all, consists of a single term on the Municipal Council. As mayor, will he be able to work with the Council if it remains in the hands of Mr. James's loyalists? Will he be able to persuade his well-heeled supporters to invest in his city, not just his campaign? 
 Undisciplined and unfocused in 2002, Mr. Booker has been shrewd and practical this time around. That is just as well, because the task awaiting him requires those very attributes. Let's not forget, after all, that Newark is home to a pair of powerful state senators whose names will be familiar to him: Sharpe James (yes, he holds two jobs) and Ronald Rice. The two senators will be in a position either to help or hurt Mr. Booker.
 Neither the city nor a new administration needs another street fight. This Election Day ought to be about new beginnings.

 BODY:

Q. I am fascinated by the ever-changing multicolored lighting on top of the Empire State Building. Could you tell me the schedule?

A. Only the highlights. Most gazers probably don't realize how often the lighting system changes and how many groups, causes, nations and holidays are honored. The building's Web site, www.esbnyc.com, lists 67 combinations of up to three colors that have been used. (Examples of color schemes and the subjects they have celebrated can be found atop the pages of this section.)
The possibilities are seemingly endless. For example, as one reads the colors from the bottom up, as a pedestrian would see them, lavender-lavender-white honors the anniversary of the Stonewall uprising. Yellow has celebrated the U.S. Open tennis tournament, among other topics. Purple-purple-gold honored the golden jubilee day of Queen Elizabeth II. 
 Just looking up won't tell you everything. Are you looking at red-blue-white? You could be seeing a commemoration of Philippine independence or the colors of the New York Rangers. Blue -- just blue -- has been used to commemorate more than a dozen subjects, including Unicef, Boys and Girls Clubs, child abuse prevention and Jazz at Lincoln Center.
 If you want to light the building pink for Mom's birthday, sorry. Building policy does not allow lighting for commercial or corporate events, or personal celebrations, though requests are taken for nonprofit or charitable celebrations. 
 To avoid the risk to birds, which are attracted to the lights, the tower lights are turned off during spring and fall migration seasons and on some cloudy, humid or foggy nights, when large numbers of birds are seen flying near the building.
 The Empire State Building has been lighted to some degree since November 1932, when a searchlight beacon alerted the public to Franklin D. Roosevelt's election as president. Colored lighting came in 1976. 
 Installed in each of the four faces of the topmost mast are four vertical banks of 11 eight-foot panels positioned one on top of another, for a total of 176 panels. A ring of 32 sodium vapor lights above the 102nd floor was installed in 1984 to create a golden halo effect around the top of the mast from dusk to dawn.

Q. When I was on the Empire State Building's observation deck, I got to wondering why the building stopped where it did. I've read that buildings could have been built much higher.

A. It's true; buildings could have gone higher. In 1956, Frank Lloyd Wright even sketched a design for a mile-high 528-story skyscraper in Illinois.
 But the Empire State Building, to say nothing of Wright's behemoth, was limited by economic factors. As a building rises higher, more structural steel and bracing are required, lowering the amount of rentable space and increasing costs. While the Empire State Building was being planned, the American Institute of Steel Construction issued a report estimating that a skyscraper's rate of economic return declined if it went higher than 63 stories. 
 But perhaps the major factor limiting height was the elevators. As floors went higher, more passengers had to be served and the elevator cables were longer. Wider shafts were needed, reducing rentable space.
 Balancing speed with comfort is a juggling act. The acceleration of elevators has to be tolerable for riders' knees and stomachs. The Empire State elevators travel as fast as 1,000 feet a minute.
 For the record, the Empire State Building stands 1,250 feet tall. A broadcasting antenna adds 204 feet to the overall height, making it 1,454 feet. An earlier antenna, which stood from 1951 to 1984, was 18 feet taller. MICHAEL POLLAK

HEADLINE: The 'Sky Boys'

BYLINE: By JIM RASENBERGER. 
Jim Rasenberger is the author of ''High Steel: The Daring Men Who Built the World's Greatest Skyline,'' a history of New York's ironworkers.

 BODY:
THE shy, slight man who showed up on 34th Street one spring day carrying a four-by-five Graflex camera probably failed to make a powerful first impression on the workers he'd been hired to photograph. He wore owlish glasses, his ears stuck out, and his demeanor was that of the bookish schoolteacher he once had been. Altogether, he looked as if he could be blown off a steel beam by a stiff breeze.
 Lewis Wickes Hine was easily underestimated. But from the moment he'd quit his job at the Ethical Culture School two decades earlier to devote his life to photography, he had proved himself brave and resourceful, not to mention enormously gifted. During his early years of photographing children in coal mines in Pennsylvania and cotton mills in South Carolina, he often posed as a Bible salesman or a life insurance agent to gain entry, then slipped away before he could be discovered and beaten up. The haunting portraits Hine brought back from those expeditions galvanized child labor laws in America and made him the pre-eminent documentary photographer of the Progressive era. 
But by 1930 all that was long behind. Hine's brand of sociological concern was out of fashion, and his photographs were out of favor. The onset of the Depression only reduced the chance that this washed-up 56-year-old would find decent work with his camera. Still, when the phone call came from his old friend Belle Moskowitz, who was working as the Empire State Building's publicist, he must have hesitated before accepting her offer to become the building's official photographer. On one hand, it meant selling out to the kind of corporate interest he had long disdained. On the other hand, he needed the money.
 Hine was hired to photograph all aspects of the building's construction, but it is obvious from his photographs that he found his most stirring subject in the structural ironworkers. These men -- ''sky boys,'' as Hine would come to call them -- raised the building's steel frame, balancing on airy perches to join columns and beams, leading the way upward as the other trades followed from below. A tight-knit, swashbuckling clan of Newfoundlanders, Mohawk Indians, Scandinavians and Irish-Americans, they were self-proclaimed ''roughnecks'' who, as the New York Times writer C. G. Poore put it at the time, spent their days ''strolling on the thin edge of nothingness.'' 
 Hine understood that to photograph the men who raised steel, it would not do to stand on the pavement. He would have to enter their element, to climb out among them at high altitude and take the chances they took. One of Hine's more ingenious techniques was to have himself hoisted in an open steel box rigged to a derrick line so that he could dangle over the ironworkers, a quarter-mile above the ground. Thus, he managed to capture, as no one had before, the dizzying and sometimes marvelous work of building skyscrapers. 
 That work had never been so marvelous as it was on 34th Street in the spring and summer of 1930. Under Hine's eye, the ironworkers raised 57,000 tons of steel in just six months, almost 50 percent more than the amount used in the Chrysler and Bank of Manhattan buildings combined. 
 Hine's photographs of the men, later collected in a volume called ''Men at Work,'' convey an almost palpable appreciation of their physical labor. While his earlier reform-minded photographs portray his working-class subjects as sympathetic victims, those from the Empire State Building treat them as heroes: muscle-bound men, with strong jaw lines and sun-bleached hair, conquering gravity and steel. 
 They stand on airy perches, hang off guy wires and catch rides on the steel balls of derricks, all the while brimming with confidence and derring-do. The world below may have been descending into economic despair, but these are images of unabashed optimism. And whatever success the Empire State Building later achieved as architecture or real estate, Hine's photographs sealed its status as a stunning human endeavor, animating its steel and brick with something like soul. Even today, it is difficult to look up from 34th Street without conjuring one of Hine's sky boys clambering among the clouds, and the building is better for it.
 After the steel frame topped out in November 1930, the workers dispersed and returned to less glorified work or, in the grip of the Depression, to none at all. Hine returned to his home in Hastings-on-Hudson and to mounting financial difficulties. The photographs he had taken on the Empire State Building would later fetch tens of thousands of dollars and become among the best-known images in the world, but they did little to help his foundering career at the time. When he died 10 years later, he was destitute.
 For those months in 1930, though, both the photographer and the ironworkers were at the top of their games, and each gave the other an invaluable gift. Hine gave the men a degree of honor and immortality that is rarely bestowed on blue-collar workers. They, in turn, lent his photographs their exhilarating pride and grace, and inspired some of the greatest work of his life. 

'Everybody Seems to Think You Have to Be a Superman'
 THE names and biographies of most of the men who worked on the Empire State Building are lost now. But one of Lewis Wickes Hine's photography subjects left behind a few words to explain himself when a journalist visited him during a lunch break on the 84th floor. His name was Victor Gosselin; he was known to his fellow ironworkers simply as ''Frenchy'' because he had been raised in Montreal. Frenchy was a connector, one of the especially agile ironworkers whose task was to snatch steel from the sky as it came sailing in on the boom of the derrick, then wrangle it into the building's frame.
 In Hine's photographs, Frenchy is shirtless and wears cutoff jeans that reveal cuts and bruises on his legs. That a connector, who shinnies up and down rusted steel columns all day, would wear shorts is beyond imagining, but there he is, taking a trip on the derrick ball, a half grin on his face as his shorts ride up like a chorus girl's.
 ''Everybody seems to think you have to be a superman or something to work on steel,'' Frenchy told the journalist. ''Of course, it ain't no picnic, but then there's lots of jobs I'd pass up for this. I wouldn't want to be no taxi driver, for instance. Look at them down there, dodging in and out of that traffic all day long. A guy's apt to get killed that way.'' 
 Munching on a huge steak sandwich, Frenchy revealed that he had come close to getting killed several times in falls and had seen dozens of other men die. What did his wife think of his work? ''She don't think nothing about it. You don't see Lindbergh's wife telling him he can't fly around in airplanes, do you?'' Frenchy shrugged.
 ''I don't know,'' he added. ''She never says nothing but 'Goodbye, baby; don't get hurt.' '' JIM RASENBERGER

 BODY:
AS recently as 1993, the New York area was a backwater for minor league baseball. After all, it had the Yankees and the Mets, who between them played a total of 162 home games a year.
 There was one minor league team -- the Red Sox in New Britain, Conn. -- in an area embracing Connecticut, New Jersey and a chunk of New York, including Long Island and Westchester and Dutchess Counties.
Last year the Yankees and the Mets drew a total of 6.9 million fans, 2.7 million more than in 1993. But these days 16 minor league teams share that same swath of land, and at least 3 more are on the way, leading some fans to wonder: How much of a good -- and sometimes not-so-good -- thing can even the most ardent baseball fan stand?
 The fact is, New York City and its suburbs have become a hotbed for minor league baseball, saturating the region with more clubs any other part of the country. And if a Yankees or Mets game is akin to taking in a Broadway play, then a minor league game is like a trip to a neighborhood cineplex. 
 ''It's Hometown U.S.A.,'' said James P. Molinaro, the borough president of Staten Island, which is home to the Yankees' New York-Penn League team. ''And it gives the parent an opportunity to go out and see some baseball with his family without spending $400.''
 Tickets, as well as peanuts, popcorn and hot dogs, are substantially less expensive in the minors than in the big leagues. The best seat in the house for a Staten Island Yankees game costs $11; a seat at the top of the upper deck of Yankee Stadium is $20. 
 Of course, players in the minor leagues are far less polished than their big-league counterparts, but most people who go to a game already know that. The quality of play is not much better than it is at, say, a local college game. And the age of most of the players is similar. Only one of the 26 players on the current roster of the Lakewood BlueClaws, the Philadelphia Phillies' Class A affiliate, has celebrated his 24th birthday. 
 Still, minor league officials like to say they have built an audience by emphasizing the notion that a night of baseball in Lakewood, Coney Island or Bridgeport is affordable family entertainment.
 It is an appeal that has resonated. 
 In 2005, the 16 minor league teams in the area drew a total of 3,835,689 fans, or slightly fewer than the record 4,090,440 the Yankees drew last year while playing in a stadium about 10 times the size of an average minor league park.
 While minor league fans will not see Alex Rodriguez swatting a home run for the Yankees or Pedro Martinez pitching to perfection for the Mets, they may get to cavort with a fuzzy mascot or participate in a three-legged race between innings.
 ''If people leave the park without knowing who won or lost the game, then we have done our job,'' said Jim Beaudoin, the general manager of the Connecticut Defenders of the Eastern League.

More Than a Ballpark
 Indeed, minor league baseball has become such a cottage industry that it is now regarded as a way to lure families and large groups into redeveloped areas where baseball is just one attraction. Retail shops, restaurants, office space and hotels are often other parts of the package.
 But a minor league ballpark does not guarantee that the area around it will be developed. For instance, KeySpan Park on Coney Island, where the Brooklyn Cyclones, a Mets' farm team, have played to capacity crowds since 2001, does not appear to have changed its surroundings much.
 ''If a ballpark is not part of a larger urban redevelopment, it's not going to be successful,'' said Mary-Jane Foster, a real estate developer who with her husband, Jack McGregor, owns and operates the Bridgeport Bluefish, an Atlantic League team in Connecticut. The couple bought the team in December.
 That lesson has not been lost on Mr. McGregor and Ms. Foster, who own one of three Atlantic League expansion teams on the drawing board. In their case, a ballpark in Yonkers is to be the jewel of a $3.1-billion downtown renovation project.
 The two other proposals for the Atlantic League, which was founded in 1998 and is made up of independent teams with no major league ties, call for new stadiums to be built as part of Meadowlands Xanadu, a shopping center and entertainment complex going up in the Meadowlands Sports Complex, and a project in Nassau County on Long Island.
 For now, Steven B. Kalafer -- a developer and owner of about 30 automobile dealerships who at one time had a stake in every team in the Atlantic League except the Atlantic City Surf -- also owns a franchise called the Bergen Cliff Hawks, which he planned to have play at a ballpark at Xanadu. But for now, the financially troubled developers of Xanadu have failed to produce a plan for the park and Mr. Kalafer is suing them. 
 The Nassau County team, which still does not have a name, will be operated by Frank Boulton, the founder and commissioner of the Atlantic League and the owner of three of its teams, including the Long Island Ducks. The Ducks have played to capacity crowds at the 6,002-seat Citibank Park in Central Islip since the league began in 1998.
 Mr. Boulton does not seem to be concerned that his new team will play its home games just 25 miles west of the Ducks, who drew 429,218 to 70 home dates last season. He conceded in a recent interview that the landscape could become too cluttered with minor league teams, but he insisted that point had not yet been reached. 
 As Mr. Kalafer said, ''The region was simply under-served.''
 That is not to say that owning a minor league team in the region is a ticket to success. 

Nearly Saturated?
 Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College who is a leading authority on the business of sports, said in a telephone interview that in general, it is hard to have too many minor league teams, since fans prefer to travel only minutes to a game. But he said the New York area might be nearly saturated. 
 ''I'm exaggerating here, but it's a little bit like having a bowling alley in each community,'' he said. 
 ''It sounds to me like 16 is too many,'' Mr. Zimbalist said of New York's crop of teams. ''You can certainly have a glut.''
 Take the New Jersey Cardinals, a farm club of the St. Louis Cardinals. At the end of last season, they moved from Sussex County to a new ballpark in State College, Pa., where the team will be called the Spikes. Or the Ravens, an Eastern League affiliate of the Toronto Blue Jays, who left New Haven, Conn., for Manchester, N.H., where a new ballpark was completed after the 2003 season.
 ''Yale Field did not have some of the amenities you'd like to have in a modern ballpark,'' said Charlie Dowd, the former general manager of the Ravens, who is now general manager of the Bridgeport Bluefish.
 But just as quickly as teams move to other homes, new ones take their place. Sussex County and New Haven quickly lured franchises from the Can-Am League, another independent league. The New Haven County Cutters entered the league in 2004, and the Sussex Skyhawks will make their debut this season.
 The Cutters' management spruced up Yale Field, a charming ballpark in West Haven, Conn. As for the Skyhawks, the team spent $1.5 million renovating Skylands Park, in Augusta, yet it sliced ticket and concession prices to woo back fans, and it is focusing heavily on group sales. A box seat that had cost $12 is now $10, and hot dogs, which sold for $3.25, now cost $2.50. 
 ''I absolutely think it's a gold mine,'' said the general manager of the Skyhawks, Ben Wittkowski, who had worked for the New Jersey Jackals, another team in the Can-Am League in Montclair. ''It's the only game in town.'' 
 Although the Long Island and Somerset teams have always attracted large crowds, other Atlantic League teams have struggled. The Nashua Pride, in New Hampshire, switched to the Can-Am League during the off-season, obliging the Atlantic League to find a new eighth team to balance its schedule.
 Another of Mr. Boulton's teams, the Atlantic City Surf, averaged 2,018 fans a game last year at its 5,900-seat stadium, the Sandcastle, and the Newark Bears, owned in part by Mr. Kalafer until late last year, averaged 2,709 in 2005 at their 6,200-seat home park. 
 ''But this will really be the first season since the park has opened that there's not construction going on in front of the site,'' Mr. Kalafer said.
 Last season, the Bluefish averaged only 3,036 fans a game at the 5,300-seat Ballpark at Harbor Yard. Mr. Dowd, the general manager, said the team did not have enough money to advertise, a crucial component to success in the minors. 
 Ms. Foster, one of the new owners of the team, said the push is on to make the Bluefish enticing to suburban mothers, who usually make the entertainment decisions for their families.
 ''It has not made money,'' she said. ''But we also believe that it can.''
 Indeed, Ms. Foster says she is so sure of the drawing power of minor league teams that she and her husband plan to run an Atlantic League team in Yonkers, N.Y., where the stadium will be the hub of that city's redevelopment when it is completed, starting in 2008. 
 ''We were really amazed at how Yonkers has turned itself around,'' she said.
 Even though the downtown area of Yonkers, a city of 200,000, is less than 10 miles from Yankee Stadium and less than 20 miles from Shea, Mayor Philip A. Amicone says the team will not compete for customers with New York's two big-league teams.
 ''To travel to Yankee Stadium and Shea Stadium costs a fortune for a family,'' he said. ''Now, Yonkers is going to be a place where people want to come again.''
 The ballparks on the drawing board for the Meadowlands and in Nassau County will not be in the middle of existing urban areas, but the goal is the same: to draw those seeking affordable family entertainment to a site that also has offices, shops and restaurants.

A Late Addition
 In fact, a ballpark was not originally included in Charles B. Wang's plan to renovate Nassau Coliseum, the home of his two franchises, the New York Islanders of hockey and the Dragons of arena football. 
 In addition to a refurbished arena and a sports technology center, Mr. Wang, founder of Computer Associates, wants to build office towers, hotels, apartment buildings and town houses on the site.
 Mr. Wang and Reckson Associates, his development partner, were awarded the project last month over a rival bid by the owners of the Mets, in part because they added a minor league ballpark to their plan to match the one the Mets proposed.
 The Meadowlands Xanadu development is no less ambitious. Besides a luxury hotel and office buildings, the Mills Corporation, the lead developer of the site, has vowed that Xanadu will be a 4.8-million-square-foot ''entertainment destination.''
 What Bergen County stands to gain -- if a ballpark is ever built there -- is a team that it truly can call its own.
 ''It's a community builder, it's something that can bring pride to a community,'' said Steve Cohen, the general manager of the Brooklyn Cyclones. ''We realize that not everyone who comes to a Cyclones game is a die-hard baseball fan.''
 As Mr. Cohen put it: ''For every two people who, walking in, are baseball fans, there are two people who aren't. But they leave with a smile on their faces, just like the baseball fans do.''

Leagues of Their Own
 When it comes to minor league baseball, it's hard to tell the teams apart without a scorecard.
 Today there are eight minor league teams in New Jersey, four in Connecticut, two in New York City and one each on Long Island and in Dutchess County in New York, representing five different leagues. Three of those leagues -- the Eastern, South Atlantic and New York-Penn Leagues -- consist of farm teams of major league clubs.
 The Eastern League is a Class AA league, meaning that its players are two steps from the majors, and the South Atlantic League is Class A, three steps away. Teams in each of the two leagues, which opened the season earlier this month, play 140 games a season
 The New York-Penn League is a short-season Class A league, and teams -- made up largely of players who tend to be younger and less skilled than in the long-season Class A league -- play a 76-game schedule beginning in June.
 In addition, two independent leagues, the Atlantic and the Can-Am, have teams in the area. Neither league has ties to the majors, but big-league clubs often raid independent teams to stock their rosters. Of the two leagues, the Atlantic, which plays a 136-game schedule that opens this week, tends to have players who have accomplished more as professionals.
 The most notable Atlantic League player in recent years was Rickey Henderson, the former Yankees and Mets outfielder and the major-league career leader in stolen bases, who played for the Newark Bears in 2003 before signing a contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers midway through the major-league season.
 The Can-Am League, which plays a 92-game schedule that begins in late May, has younger players hoping to impress scouts from major league teams that want to fill the rosters of their minor affiliates. DAVE CALDWELL

HEADLINE: Poorer School Districts Practice Higher Math to Pay Leaders

BYLINE: By FORD FESSENDEN

 BODY:
OSSINING is one of the poorer school districts in Westchester, and its students' achievement levels are average. But in one category, it is competitive with the best districts in the state: Its administrators are well paid.
 Superintendent Robert J. Roelle is one of a small but growing group of superintendents who make more than $300,000 in salary and benefits, according to information compiled by the State Education Department. And with 26 assistant superintendents, principals and department chairmen and women making at least $104,000, Ossining has one of the largest contingents of six-figure executives in the state: about 6 per 1,000 students, a level rivaled only by a few other districts in Westchester and Long Island.
''It's more than the governor makes,'' Irwin Kavy, the school board president, said of Dr. Roelle's salary. ''It's extremely high.''
 Across suburban New York, salaries of school administrators are testing new heights. Districts, competing to give the children of their affluent residents every advantage, have helped create a seller's market for management talent that has pushed some superintendents into the thin air of the $300,000 salary-and-benefit package. 
 Meanwhile, the $200,000 milestone -- effectively the floor for superintendent pay now -- has become increasingly common among deputy and assistant superintendents. Fifty-six school administrators in Westchester now make more than $200,000 in total compensation, and 19 of them are assistants or deputies.
 Every year, districts must report to the state any administrator whom they pay more than a certain figure, now set at $104,000. Some fail to do so, and state officials say they have no way of enforcing the law, unless they get a complaint from a citizen. In Westchester this year, however, salaries for all but 2 of the more than 40 districts were available. 
 School board members like Mr. Kavy, under pressure to deliver higher test scores, say they must pay well enough to lure and retain good people for that task. But as scandals and rising taxes put administration under a microscope, the strain is beginning to show.
 ''Our administrators for the most part work extremely hard, they work long days and hours,'' Mr. Kavy said. ''But it is a lot of money, and it's very hard to justify the high compensation packages, other than to say it's the system, and the competition for limited resources.''
 The median increase in total compensation of superintendents in the county was 8.6 percent last year, according to data reported to the Education Department. Inflation advanced just 3.3 percent in that time.
 The median increase for assistant and deputy superintendents was nearly as much, 7.8 percent. Principals' pay also advanced, but it is more difficult to calculate the rate from the figures compiled by the state because some principals make less than the threshold and their salaries are not reported. Nor are principals' benefits reported individually.
 School boards and their supporters say they are caught in a squeeze that is only partly of their own making. Demand has increased because a cohort of teachers hired in the late 1960's, who became administrators in the 1980's and 1990's, is now retiring. Boards are looking to replace about 80 of the state's approximately 750 superintendents each year, instead of the usual 40 or 45, according to Thomas Rogers, executive director of the New York State Council of School Superintendents.
 But supply has dwindled, officials contend, because administrative jobs have become less attractive. 
 ''The job has become incredibly complex,'' said Vincent T. Beni, a recruiter and former superintendent in Irvington. ''Fiscal constraints are imposed from outside, and they drive a lot of the decisions. The imposition of mandates from state and federal government are not funded, and require you to go out and ask people to raise their taxes to pay for them. When I first started, we were education leaders of the community. Now, you've become a fund-raiser.''
 In a 2003 survey, the school superintendents council found that the average age at which a superintendent first took a top district job was 48, compared with 38 in the early 1990's.
 Mr. Rogers said that is partly a demographic issue: women, who tend to be given the top job at an older age than men are, now account for 22 percent of superintendents in the state, up from 12 percent in 1997.
 But, he said, higher age levels are also a barometer of reluctance: The job is hard, especially in the small districts where residents expect a lot and costs are soaring.
 ''The environment is more hostile,'' he said. ''The tension has never been greater because the demand has never been greater and the costs have never been greater.'' 
 DONNA WALSH, the school board president in the Katonah-Lewisboro district, said: ''In an affluent community like ours, the people are very sophisticated, they're very demanding and you work in this fishbowl. It's a very challenging job.''
 Part of the reason for the scarcity of administrators at all levels, authorities say, is that teaching has recently become much better paid. Teachers have better job security and work shorter hours for generous benefits, and thousands now make six-figure salaries. In the Bedford Central School District, for instance, the middle school principal made $132,000 in salary last year; the top-paid teacher made $136,279. Those figures don't include benefits.
 ''Our experienced teachers are already making $100,000 and they're working on a 180-day year,'' said Dr. Roelle of Ossining. ''I'm competing with my own internal marketplace of teachers. If I'm not offering a salary that makes it worthwhile to pull them away from families in the summertimes, I'm not going to get the best people.'' 
 Critics dismiss the talk of low supply and high demand and say that cozy relationships between boards and administrators are the reason for the large pay packages. 
 ''To imply there is not a tremendous number of people interested in 126 jobs that are the highest-paid jobs on Long Island, in an industry that is protected by contracts, is a joke,'' said Fred Gorman, a tax protester in Nesconset, N.Y., citing the number of Nassau and Suffolk districts.
 Joseph Auricchio, an Edgemont businessman who opposes hefty school taxes, says superintendents in suburban districts are not only overpaid but also, in some cases, not qualified. ''Superintendents are teachers plucked out of the classroom to do a C.E.O.'s job totally unprepared and inexperienced,'' he said in an e-mail exchange.
 Mr. Kavy echoed those sentiments. He favors changing the state requirement that administrators be certified teachers, which he believes has contributed to the problems. 
 Because of the requirement, he said, ''someone with a great deal of experience in managing, but was never a teacher, can't fill those positions, so there's a shortage of administrators out there.
 ''And it's causing districts to claw over each other to get good ones,'' he said.
 Organizations that represent school boards and superintendents say the elected board members are running too scared before their increasingly rebellious taxpayers to enter into compensation conspiracies with their administrators.
 ''Everyone is obsessed with property tax rates,'' said David Ernst, spokesman for the New York State School Boards Association. ''I don't see where it works to a district's advantage to go wild in bidding up the contracts of superintendents. It's just not what they're thinking about.''
 Still, board members acknowledge that they feel constant pressure to keep their executives, or find new ones, and that the pressure is not likely to abate soon. The stakes are high: With more and more emphasis on measurable achievement, they want administrators who can bolster scores. 
 ''I get calls all the time from other districts,'' said Ms. Walsh, of Katonah-Lewisboro, ''and they have the nerve to say they saw one of our assistant superintendents at a conference, and do I think they'd be interested in a new job?''
 Mr. Ernst argued that the overall bill for central administrators -- not principals, but higher-ranking administrators -- is lower on average in New York districts than in other states. ''There are a lot of highly paid administrators,'' he said, ''but there are not a lot of administrators, so people are being required to earn their money.'' 
 Nevertheless, wage levels are further straining finances. Ossining is typical of those caught in the squeeze: More students who need attention, but less resources to help them. One in 10 Ossining students have limited English proficiency, and one in five come from families with income low enough to qualify for free lunch. In the nearby Briarcliff Manor district, only about one in 1,000 students qualify for free lunch. Yet Ossining has about 50 percent less taxable income per pupil than Briarcliff Manor, according to state calculations. 
 ''We have a diverse student body, and we have a large achievement gap that we're expending huge resources to try to rectify,'' Mr. Kavy said. ''It's good to have a superintendent with lots of experience, but it's tough on the taxpayers who have to pay for it.''


GRAPHIC: Chart/Map: ''Top Pay for Top Jobs''The shading of each school district is based on its concentration of high-salaried administrators, meaning any superintendents, assistant and deputy superintendents, principals, assistant principals and department heads whose annual salary and benefits exceed $104,000.

AS recently as 1993, the New York area was a backwater for minor league baseball. After all, it had the Yankees and the Mets, who between them played a total of 162 home games a year.
 There was one minor league team -- the Red Sox in New Britain, Conn. -- in an area embracing Connecticut, New Jersey and a chunk of New York, including Long Island and Westchester and Dutchess Counties.

The quality of play is not much better than what it is at, say, a local college game. And the age of most of the players is similar.

 It is an appeal that has resonated.

 While minor league fans will not get to see Alex Rodriguez swatting a home run for the Yankees or Pedro Martinez pitching to perfection for the Mets, they may get to cavort with a fuzzy mascot or participate in a three-legged race between innings.
 ''If people leave the park without knowing who won or lost the game, then we have done our job,'' said Jim Beaudoin, the general manager of the Connecticut Defenders of the Eastern League, a team based in Norwich.
 Indeed, minor league baseball has become such a cottage industry that it is now regarded as a way to lure families and large groups into redeveloped areas where baseball is just one attraction. Retail shops, restaurants, office space and hotels are often other parts of the package.
 But a minor league ballpark does not guarantee that the area around it will be developed. For instance, KeySpan Park on Coney Island, where the Brooklyn Cyclones, a Mets' farm team, have played to capacity crowds since 2001, does not appear to have changed its surroundings much.
 ''If a ballpark is not part of a larger urban redevelopment, it's not going to be successful,'' said Mary-Jane Foster, a real estate developer who with her husband, Jack McGregor, owns and operates the Bridgeport Bluefish of the Atlantic League.
 That lesson has not been lost on Mr. McGregor and Ms. Foster, who own one of three Atlantic League expansion teams on the drawing board. In their case, a ballpark in Yonkers is to be the jewel of a $3.1-billion downtown renovation project.
 The two other proposals for the Atlantic League, which was founded in 1998 and is made up of independent teams with no major-league ties, call for new stadiums to be built as part of Meadowlands Xanadu, a shopping center and entertainment complex going up in the Meadowlands Sports Complex in New Jersey, and a project in Nassau County on Long Island.
 For now, Steven B. Kalafer -- a developer and owner of about 30 automobile dealerships who at one time had a stake in every team in the Atlantic League with the exception of the Atlantic City Surf -- also owns a New Jersey franchise called the Bergen Cliff Hawks, which he planned to have play at a ballpark at Xanadu. But for now, the financially troubled developers of Xanadu have failed to produce a plan for the park and Mr. Kalafer is suing them. 
 The Nassau County team, which still does not have a name, will be operated by Frank Boulton, the founder and commissioner of the Atlantic League who already owns three teams in it, including the Long Island Ducks, which has played to capacity crowds at the 6,000-seat Citibank Park in Central Islip since its inception in 1998.
 Mr. Boulton does not seem to be concerned that his new team will be based about 25 miles west of the Ducks, who drew 429,218 to 70 home dates last season. He conceded in a recent interview that the landscape could become too cluttered with minor league teams, although he insisted that point had not yet been reached. 
 As Mr. Kalafer said, ''The region was simply under-served.''
 That is not to say that owning a minor league team in the region is a ticket to success. 
 Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College who is a leading authority on sports business, said in a telephone interview that while it is hard to have too many minor league teams -- since fans prefer to travel only minutes to a game -- the New York area might well be reaching that point. 
 ''I'm exaggerating here, but it's a little bit like having a bowling alley in each community,'' he said. 
 But when it comes to the New York area, with 16 minor league teams and more on the way, Mr. Zimbalist said: ''It sounds to me like 16 is too many. You can certainly have a glut.''
 Take the New Jersey Cardinals, a farm club of the St. Louis Cardinals, which at the end of last season moved from Sussex County to a new ballpark in State College, Pa., where the team will be called the Spikes. Or the Ravens, an Eastern League affiliate of the Toronto Blue Jays, who left New Haven, Conn., for Manchester, N.H., where a new ballpark was completed after the 2003 season.
 ''Yale Field did not have some of the amenities you'd like to have in a modern ballpark,'' said Charlie Dowd, the former general manager of the Ravens who is now general manager of the Bridgeport Bluefish.
 But just as quickly as teams move to other homes, new ones take their place. For instance, Sussex County and New Haven quickly lured franchises from the Can-Am League, another independent league. The New Haven County Cutters entered the league in 2004, and the Sussex Skyhawks will make their debut this season.
 The Cutters' management spruced up Yale Field, a charming ballpark in West Haven, Conn. As for the Skyhawks, the team spent $1.5 million renovating Skylands Park, in Augusta, yet it sliced ticket and concession prices to woo back fans, and it is focusing heavily on group sales. A box seat that had cost $12 is now $10, and hot dogs, which sold for $3.25, now cost $2.50. 
 ''I absolutely think it's a gold mine,'' said the general manager of the Skyhawks, Ben Wittkowski, who had worked for the New Jersey Jackals, another team in the Can-Am League in Montclair. ''It's the only game in town.'' 
 Although the Long Island and Somersetteams have always attracted large crowds, other Atlantic League teams have struggled. The Nashua Pride, in New Hampshire, moved to the Can-Am League during the off-season, forcing the eight-team league to replace them with the Road Warriors -- who do not yet have a home park -- to balance the schedule.
 Another of Mr. Boulton's teams, the Atlantic City Surf, averaged 2,018 fans a game last year at its 5,900-seat stadium, the Sandcastle. The Newark Bears, a New Jersey team that had been owned in part by Mr. Kalafer until late last year, averaged 2,709 in 2005 at the 6,200-seat Bears and Eagles Riverfront Stadium.
 ''But this will really be the first season since the park has opened that there's not construction going on in front of the site,'' Mr. Kalafer said.
 The Bridgeport Bluefish were founded in 1998 by a group of investors that included Ms. Foster and her husband, Mr. McGregor. Another member of the group, Mickey Herbert, bought controlling interest in the club in 2000, but Ms. Foster and Mr. McGregor bought the team from him in December 2005.
 Last season, the Bluefish averaged only 3,036 fans a game at the 5,300-seat Ballpark at Harbor Yard. The team did not have enough money to advertise, a crucial component to success in the minors, said Mr. Dowd, the general manager.
 This year, Ms. Foster said, the push is on to make the Bluefish enticing to suburban mothers, who usually make the entertainment decisions for their families.
 ''It has not made money,'' Ms. Foster said of the club. ''But we also believe that it can, or else we would not have come back.''
 Indeed, Ms. Foster says she is so sure of the drawing power of minor league teams that she and her husband plan to run an Atlantic League team in Yonkers, where the stadium will be the hub of that city's redevelopment when it is completed, probably in 2008. 
 ''We were really amazed at how Yonkers has turned itself around,'' she said.
 Even though the downtown area of Yonkers, a city of 200,000, is less than 10 miles from Yankee Stadium and less than 20 miles from Shea, Mayor Philip A. Amicone believes that the team will not be competing for customers with New York's two big-league teams.
 ''To travel to Yankee Stadium and Shea Stadium costs a fortune for a family,'' he said. ''Now, Yonkers is going to be a place where people want to come again.''
 The ballparks on the drawing board for the Meadowlands and in Nassau County will not be in the middle of urban areas, although the goal for each is the same: to draw those seeking affordable family entertainment to a site that also has offices, shops and restaurants.
 In fact, a ballpark was not originally included in Charles B. Wang's plan to renovate Nassau Coliseum, the home of the New York Islanders of the National Hockey League. 
 In addition to a substantially refurbished arena and a sports technology center, Mr. Wang -- the owner of the Islanders and founder of Computer Associates -- wanted his ambitious project to include office towers, hotels, apartment buildings and town houses.
 Mr. Wang and Reckson Associates, a development company based in Long Island that is his partner in the project, were awarded the project last month over a rival bid by the owners of the Mets, in part because they added a 6,000-seat minor league ballpark to their plan to match the one the Mets proposed.
 The Meadowlands Xanadu development is no less ambitious. Besides a luxury hotel and office buildings, the Mills Corporation, the lead developer of the site, has vowed that Xanadu will be a 4.8-million-square-foot ''entertainment destination.''
 What Bergen County stands to gain -- if a ballpark is ever built there -- is a team that it truly can call its own.
 ''It's a community builder, it's something that can bring pride to a community,'' said Steve Cohen, the general manager of the Brooklyn Cyclones. ''We realize that not everyone who comes to a Cyclones game is a die-hard baseball fan.''
 As Mr. Cohen put it: ''For every two people who walking in are baseball fans, there are two people who aren't. But they leave with a smile on their faces, just like the baseball fans do.''

HEADLINE: In Portland Quarries, a Park Huck Finn Might Love

BYLINE: By C. J. HUGHES

 BODY:
THE first time Frank Hayes saw Portland's former brownstone quarries, he was skipping school for a swim.
 That was in 1980. As they were for most of the 20th century, the quarries -- a National Historic Landmark and the source of the building blocks for much of the Upper West Side of Manhattan, as well as parts of Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, San Francisco and London -- were filled at the time with deep, clean water.
So a hot day, he said, was the perfect excuse to borrow a manure truck from the family farm in Rocky Hill for a road trip with his friends.
 ''We would drive down and party all day and then jump in,'' he said. ''It's what kids around here did.'' 
 Now, Mr. Hayes and his brothers Ed and Sean are trying to create a business at the quarries called the Brownstone Exploration and Discovery Park, where people will be able to learn scuba diving and hone their skills in emergency water rescues.
 The location includes 38 acres of water surrounded by brownstone cliffs that are colored and layered like chocolate cake, just feet from the Connecticut River. It is ideal for diving, the brothers said, because the water is so deep -- up to 95 feet in some places -- and clear. You can see 40 feet ahead of you in most places, Ed Hayes said. And algae doesn't cloud the water as it does in some ponds, he said.
 ''This won't be Disney or Six Flags, more of a Huck Finn look, so when you walk through the gates, you will be transported back in time,'' Ed Hayes said after climbing out of the water, as he packed his wet suit into a bag.
 Even though the quarries have been designated a National Historic Landmark, the town, as owner, is allowed to develop them as it wants, since the town is not receiving federal assistance. But Portland, according to Susan Bransfield, the first selectwoman, has stipulated that the Hayeses not alter the area too much, like removing old walls or loose slabs. And there is a seven-member panel that meets with the developer.
 The project was approved by the Inland Wetlands Commission on April 4. The Hayeses said they plan to begin building a ticket office, changing rooms, a place to fill tanks with air, a concession stand and floating docks to have the park ready by Memorial Day weekend for their first customers. Ed Hayes says he expects 100,000 customers in the first year.
 According to the plan presented to the town, which calls for a $1 million investment and as many as 25 jobs, the park will also ultimately include a marina for canoes and kayaks, a fish farm run by Eastern Connecticut State University, swimming platforms, hand-pulled ferries and a campground. The town is helping grade some of the land and is giving the developer gravel for the entrance road.
 There will be separate areas that companies can use for team-building activities and that firefighters and paramedics can use for simulating rescue operations by scaling down the cliffs into the water.
 Until it is completely built, the property will look somewhat bleak. Gone are the buildings that used to house workers and the pastures where the oxen that hauled the stone out of the quarry used to graze, according to old photographs. 
 Instead, a row of asphalt storage tanks, set apart by a barbed-wire fence, stands between the quarries and the Connecticut River, blocking views of where schooners used to pick up the stone slabs and sail them around the world. 
 Rick Staub, with Point One Architects and Planners of Old Saybrook, which is designing the park, said that a line of trees will screen the tanks. 
 And eventually, the area alongside the river here, which stretches north of the Arrigoni Bridge, could be rezoned into a commercial district, said Ms. Bransfield ''We won't be putting another asphalt plant down there,'' she said.
 In exchange for granting the lease, which is to last for 25 years, Portland will receive 15 percent of the park's ticket sales. 
 The town could also benefit by seeing the feature that essentially put it on the map get an overdue cleanup. Under the deal, the Hayeses must remove garbage submerged in the deep water, which, according to local legend, was a favorite dumping ground of car thieves, petty crooks and mobsters.
 Indeed, over the last two years, while the Hayeses were trying to sell the idea to Portland's town leaders, they have removed 24,000 pounds of garbage, including air-conditioners, three cars, eight motorcycles, a safe filled with lottery tickets, boxes of ammunition and a Pepsi machine, the brothers said. 
 And there are still 12 cars down there that need to be removed because leaking gas and oil is polluting the water. 
 ''It was always the place where your parents told you not to go because it was dangerous,'' said Bob McDougall, director of the Ruth Callander House Museum of Portland History. ''It had been totally forgotten by the town.''
 The quarries' heyday stretched from 1870 to 1910, when the urban middle class began demanding the same supple brownstone, which could easily be carved into different shapes, that the wealthy had recently started using to build their homes, historians and architects said.
 With cities across the country clamoring for the stone, Portland's quarries (known for a higher-grade product than similar quarries in Longmeadow, Mass., and Cromwell, Conn., historians say) met the demand, producing as much as 21,000 cubic yards of it a year, Mr. McDougall said.
 Locally, it is visible all over the Connecticut River Valley, from Trinity Church in Portland to St. John's Church across the river in Middletown, where much of Wesleyan's campus along High Street is also made of Portland brownstone. The Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Arch in Bushnell Park in Hartford is also made of Portland brownstone, Mr. McDougall said. 
 But by the 1930's the industry was suffering, and the quarries were pretty much closed by 1940. 
 Less-expensive building materials like concrete and steel, coupled with a flood that caused the Connecticut River to pour into the quarries, made brownstone hard to get and somewhat obsolete. But brownstone quarrying didn't die entirely. 
 In 1994, Mike Meehan, a Cheshire resident, started a small quarrying business on a six-and-a-half-acre parcel on the north rim of the quarry pools, where he cuts 20,000 cubic feet of stone each year for clients looking to make repairs, like the police station in Middletown and the Cooper Union in New York.
 Mr. Meehan and his three employees cut stone with glittering diamond-wire chains that essentially whittle the soft rock away from the wall. Up until now, his only company has been the dinosaur footprints that occasionally are found. Even though he worried that park visitors could wander onto his site while dangerous machinery is running, he applauded the Hayeses' determination.
 ''They're very bright and hard working and not the kinds of guys to cut corners,'' Mr. Meehan said. ''If anybody can do it, they can.''
 Another neighbor is the Brownstone Quorum, a 130-member, nonprofit group formed just after Portland bought the quarries in 1999 to raise awareness of the history of the site. The group maintains a 30-acre ribbon of riverbank to the north of the quarries, where undesirable brownstone was once discarded. It contains a mile-and-a-half latticework of trails popular among dog-walkers and bird-watchers, said Michael Susca, a Portland resident and the group's president. But access to these trails will be harder under the terms of the park deal, he said.
 ''We're sad to lose the access to the quarry, but we're glad for the town in terms of its economic development,'' he said.
 Mr. Meehan's business notwithstanding, Portland's quarries have been the subject of business brainstorms before, and not all of them worked. In the late 1980's, for example, one proposal suggested cutting a channel from the quarries to the river to create moorings for boats.
 The cleanup of the quarries could allow a new generation to appreciate how one building material gave such a signature look to much of the area, said Charles Lockwood, a consultant on brownstone home restorations.
 "It's a terrific way to let people know where the stone in their homes comes from," he said.

HEADLINE: It's Stanley Time. So Tell the Rangers. 

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY. 
E-mail: geovec@nytimes.com

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. 

 BODY:
AFTER waiting nine years to play a Stanley Cup game, the Rangers may just have to wait even longer to win one.
 The Rangers squandered their first playoff game since 1997 in a disgraceful 6-1 loss to the Devils yesterday and then in the final minute saw their best player, Jaromir Jagr, skate off the ice with what appeared to be an injury to his left shoulder.
Jagr could not promise he would be able to play in the next game tomorrow night, which means this series may never live up to the high standards of Stanley Cup hockey and cranky New York rivalries. 
 After a year's hiatus, caused by a labor shutdown that was a credit to nobody, hockey fans have essentially waited two years for a taste of playoff hockey, which can be a virtually different sport from the one practiced from October through early April. 
 The regular season can range from target practice to the occasional mugging, but when it is Stanley time, the boys stop shaving so they can rub their stubbly beards in one another's faces, just to annoy. When the field is reduced to 16 teams, everybody cranks up the aggression, but the surviving players are usually seasoned enough to cut out most of the stupid penalties. 
 The Rangers embarrassed themselves yesterday by taking 16 penalties, losing their heads before they lost the game. Even Jagr, who just had one of the great offensive seasons ever by a Ranger player -- with 54 goals and 69 assists -- lost his mind, taking a hooking penalty at 32 seconds of the third period, when the Rangers were still down by only two goals.
 ''We humiliated ourselves,'' said the Rangers' coach, Tom Renney. ''We showed basically absolutely nothing.''
 The Rangers had not qualified for the playoffs for seven straight seasons before last year's shutdown, which left such a black hole that I had to look up the identity of the defending Stanley Cup champion. I vaguely remembered one of those nouveau Sun Belt teams had won the Cup, but after two years, it is hard to keep it all straight. So I checked it out, and it is the Tampa Bay Lightning, for goodness' sake.
 I go back so far with hockey that I sometimes feel the Montreal Canadiens should always be playing Chicago or Detroit or Toronto or New York or Boston for the Stanley Cup. In reality, the Canadiens have not won a Stanley Cup since 1993 -- when some louts burned cars in downtown Montreal. 
 Maybe those ugly conflagrations have created a growing hex on the Canadiens -- the curse of the burning rubber, or something. More to the point, no other team from the True North Strong and Free has won the Cup since 1993. It's sad that economics make it hard for Canadian teams to compete with teams south of the border, but I'm willing to concede that the Devils, with their three Stanley Cup championships, now qualify as a legitimate National Hockey League dynasty. 
 The Devils certainly displayed the poise of champions yesterday. Although the rules have been retooled to favor talented offensive players like Jagr, the Devils still rely on good old-fashioned physical and mental toughness, particularly under the baleful eye of Lou Lamoriello, who came down from the front office to take over the team during the season. They practically toyed with the Rangers yesterday.
 It took the Rangers until the closing minutes to assert themselves in the old-fashioned hockey way, by starting a fight. In Stanley Cup time, if a contemporary version of old pests like Tiger Williams, Ken Linseman and Tie Domi mashes ice chips in an opponent's face during a scrum, he doesn't just hop on the team bus and head off to the next town. He's in your face for as many as seven games, with knowledgeable hockey fans looking forward to the nuance of each new game.
 One of the themes of this New York-area series was whether the Devils could intimidate Jagr, but they never had to do anything blatant yesterday. The Rangers self-destructed on their own.
 Why was Jagr still out there killing a penalty in the final minute of a 6-1 blowout? ''Practice,'' Renney said, meaning the Rangers needed to work on their cohesion. Milling around, Jagr stuck out his left arm and made contact with Scott Gomez, who barely noticed it. Jagr's left arm drooped almost immediately, as if he had separated or dislocated the shoulder. 
 ''Upper-body problem,'' Renney called it later.
 ''I got hurt,'' Jagr said. ''It's sore.'' He looked wan and sad, like an athlete who fears he won't be skating for the next few days, at least. 
 There is plenty of time for the two teams to irritate each other during this series, but by the time Jagr gets the feeling back in his shoulder, the lads could be lining line up for hockey's cathartic postseason handshake line. Welcome back, Stanley Cup time.

HEADLINE: Katrina's Tide Carries Many to Hopeful Shores

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE; Matthew Ericson and Alain Delaqueriere contributed research for this article.

DATELINE: LITHONIA, Ga. 

 BODY:
One afternoon last August, a young bus driver headed to an office in a suburb of New Orleans, humming the song to an old television show. He arrived just before his wife, who was pregnant with their first child and escorting four troubled teenagers from the alternative school where she worked. 
 At 24, the driver, Whitney Marcell, weighed 300 pounds, and answered to the name Big Man. His wife, Jeralyn, who goes by Fu, had just turned 28. She brought along the hard-faced adolescents because her own hard life had presented her with a gloriously teachable moment: Big Man and Fu, up-from-nothing products of New Orleans's roughest projects, were about to buy their first home.
''Are you sure you can afford it?'' friends had sniped, but Mr. Marcell's only worry about the $86,500 loan was whether the terms would let him pay it off early. The couple signed a pile of legal papers and left the office owning a house in New Orleans' Lower Ninth Ward. 
 As he packed that night, Mr. Marcell returned to the song from ''The Jeffersons,'' a sitcom about a dry cleaner and his wife who had risen to the black bourgeoisie. Like his television heroes, George and Louise, Mr. Marcell crooned about ''moving on up,'' then startled himself by crying.
 Two days later, Hurricane Katrina struck with biblical force, destroying the Marcells' new home, and chasing them to the outskirts of Atlanta, where they became part of the largest American diaspora since Dust Bowl days. But despite the loss of nearly everything they owned, the Marcells say they have moved up again.
 The median household income in their new neighborhood is nearly twice that in the Lower Ninth Ward, and more than four times that in the projects where they had lived. Though they had recently worked their way out of poverty in New Orleans, the Marcells say this mostly black suburb offers much safer streets, better schools and a stronger economy.
 The Marcells' journey illustrates one surprising benefit from an otherwise terrible storm: the exodus took low-income families to areas richer in opportunity. 
 The New York Times analyzed relocation patterns in 17 counties in and around Atlanta and Houston, two leading destinations for Katrina evacuees. Like the Marcells, the average evacuee has landed in a neighborhood with nearly twice the income as the one left behind, less than half as much poverty, and significantly higher levels of education, employment and home ownership.
 Still, it is unclear whether a better environment will bring success, for the Marcells or for others like them. 
 The Marcells say Atlanta has plenty of jobs, but seven months after the storm they are still jobless. They praise the school their 10-year-old attends but put much of their energy into his nascent rap career, as his reading scores lag. By the time George Jefferson was ''Moving on Up,'' he had seven dry-cleaning stores and a ''de-luxe apartment in the sky'' -- not, as the Marcells do, unemployment checks and subsidized housing.
 Some Katrina families may be too traumatized to benefit from the moves. Others may drift back to poor areas when government aid decreases. Even if they stay, the new neighborhoods may make little difference. Other forces -- like family structure, cultural heritage and personal motivation -- may do more to shape success.
 Nonetheless, the relocation of tens of thousands of low-income families creates a grand experiment in class mixing. While the full effects will not be known for years, Ms. Marcell is among those who think it will succeed. She was furious with Barbara Bush last fall when the former first lady, seeming to ignore the pain the storm had caused, said the evacuation was ''working very well'' because most displaced families ''were underprivileged anyway.'' Yet in calling Atlanta a ''land of opportunity,'' Ms. Marcell, from the other end of the class spectrum, is making a parallel point.
 Like many black New Orleanians, she has spent years listening to boosterish accounts from friends and family in greater Atlanta. She insists there is no going back. ''Everybody we know who came up here got a nice-paying job and a house,'' Ms. Marcell said. ''We going to have our time to shine.''

A Thriving Black Middle Class
 DeKalb County, where the Marcells have settled, shines especially bright for African-Americans. With a population that is 56 percent black, and an average household income close to $50,000, it forms one of the nation's great showcases for the black middle class. 
 Incorporating part of the city of Atlanta, the county spreads out 20 miles north and east to subdivisions carved from dairy farms. A drug and crime zone runs across a southwestern flank. The Marcells' apartment, in Lithonia, is on the booming eastern edge.
 It is a place that encourages African-Americans to think big. Among the local growth industries is the New Birth Missionary Baptist Church, which claims 25,000 members, including the Marcells. In pushing a gospel of prosperity, New Birth's pastor, Bishop Eddie L. Long, has practiced what he has preached. As reported by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, his compensation from a charity affiliated with the church topped $3 million over four years. 
 Three years ago, New Birth started a center for aspiring entrepreneurs. Darold P. Honore Jr., one parishioner Bishop Long nurtured in business, arrived from New Orleans two decades ago and is now Lithonia's part-time mayor. ''It's different from the Big Easy, where everyone's pretty much contented,'' Mr. Honore said. ''Here it's more or less moving and shaking.''
 To make his point, he offered a tour of subdivisions bulging with 10,000-square-foot homes, many occupied by Lithonia's black elite. A mile away, all but spilling into the Marcells' apartment, is the four-year-old Stonecrest Mall, which covers former pastureland with 1.3 million square feet of hotels, restaurants and stores.
 Growth is the region's secular religion. A half-century ago, Atlanta was a second-string province the size of Birmingham, Ala. Now it is home to four million people and the world's busiest airport, with a prosperity that crosses color lines. Compared with blacks nationwide, the black population of greater Atlanta is much better paid, much better educated and much more likely to be raising children with two parents at home. 
 William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution, found that since the mid-1980's, more black New Orleanians have left for greater Atlanta than for any other place. Among them was Mr. Marcell's mother, who was 17 when he was born. She left him with his father's mother and joined the crowds in the out-bound lane.

Up From the Mean Streets
 Once the economic leader of the South, New Orleans has been in decline for at least 100 years. The Marcells came of age there in an especially mean place and time: public housing in the age of crack. 
 Over the last 25 years, the city had lost nearly one in five residents and one in seven jobs. Seven superintendents had passed through the school system in 10 years. By the mid-1990's, no American city had a higher homicide rate. Raised in the mayhem, the Marcells each clung to a fortifying thought: ''I'm better than this.''
 Home for Mr. Marcell was the St. Thomas project, a low-rise slum along the Mississippi River near the mansions of the Garden District. When he talks of the grandmother who raised him there, Mercedes Jackson, he dwells on two points: she worked a lot -- as a hospital aide -- and prayed even more. ''I cannot say I ever saw a day when she did not get on her knees,'' he said. 
 His father, who had a job in a printing plant, lived nearby with a younger set of children, and visited often. With a third of the St. Thomas apartments vacant, trouble could hide anywhere. Mr. Marcell took to hiding, too, behind a genial front that gave little away. ''You can't show your teeth to every guy you meet,'' he said. ''Cause everybody not ready to be cool.'' 
 Ms. Marcell grew up in like fashion -- in a working poor family stuck in the projects but steadied by faith. Her mother, Sherry Williams, raised six children in the B. W. Cooper Homes as a nursing aide. Ms. Marcell's father, a roofer, lived with the family into her teens, when her parents divorced.
 Pregnant in the 10th grade, Ms. Marcell left school, but quickly earned a high school equivalency degree and put her jauntiness to work as a waitress. To improve her vocabulary, she had a younger sister, Keisha -- a future high school valedictorian -- drill her on word lists. ''I always was talking -- I won't say like a thug -- but like a street person,'' Ms. Marcell said. ''I knew I could talk better.''
 Crack arrived midway through the Marcells' youths, turning the projects into killing zones. A 9-year-old boy in Ms. Marcell's neighborhood lost his life to an errant bullet just weeks after writing to President Bill Clinton ''to stop the killings.'' Among the items Keisha salvaged from the Katrina flood was her 2004 valedictory speech at John McDonogh High School, lamenting ''evil and its wicked ways,'' a reference to the day in her junior year when three teenagers with an AK-47 executed a rival during gym class.
 After finishing high school in 1999, Mr. Marcell joined his mother in DeKalb County, where she had prospered as a medical billing specialist and married a sheriff's deputy. But Mr. Marcell returned to New Orleans after a year and met his future wife in a club.
 Ms. Marcell recalls hearing God tell her she was looking into her husband's face. ''I asked him, did he have Christ in his life,'' she said. He asked her the same. They married seven months later and started family life in the Cooper project with Ms. Marcell's 6-year-old son, Rashad Ballard. 
 Though they worked a set of menial jobs, like parking cars and waiting tables, they also started a series of entrepreneurial ventures: a house-cleaning business, car detailing and a Friday night takeout service called ''Big Man and Fu's Suppers.'' 
 In 2004, the Marcells moved up -- him to a job as a city bus driver, her to a counselor's post at a school for juvenile delinquents. Rashad, a shy schoolboy off the stage but a dervish on it, started a rap career. After a few small-time gigs, he appeared on the BET network last spring for a few seconds of background dancing in a video by the rapper Chopper. 
 ''We saw a massive change in our life just ahead,'' Ms. Marcell said. ''Cause we knew that Rashad's career was going to hit off.''
 With a combined income of more than $40,000, the Marcells discovered they could get a mortgage, and they found a four-bedroom home last summer in the Lower Ninth Ward. As they moved their belongings the day after the house settlement, Hurricane Katrina rushed toward New Orleans. With Ms. Marcell four months pregnant, they were in no mood to test the storm.
 They left for Georgia that night, planning a short stay with Mr. Marcell's mother. In time, most of their scattered family would join them outside Atlanta-- 25 people in seven apartments, one exit from Stonecrest Mall.

Neighborhoods of Hope
 Like pellets from a shotgun blast, New Orleanians spread everywhere, filing change-of-address cards from cities as distant as Anchorage and San Juan, P.R. About 365,000 city residents fled; only about a quarter have returned.
 Given the physics of race and class, there was reason to worry about where they would land. Three-quarters of flood-zone residents were black, and nearly 6 in 10 were living on less than $30,000 a year. Nationally, such families tend to be crowded together in areas long on crime, short on jobs and plagued by inferior schools. 
 That is not the story of Katrina evacuees. In both Atlanta and Houston, their neighborhoods look much like the region as a whole. Measured against where they had lived in New Orleans, most find that a big step up.
 To examine relocation patterns, The Times counted evacuees at elementary schools in metropolitan Atlanta and Houston: 13,000 students at 1,100 schools. Using the schools as proxies for neighborhoods, The Times then analyzed the surrounding Census Bureau tracts. 
 In both cities, the average evacuee lives in a place extraordinary only for its ordinariness. Neighborhoods where evacuees settled have virtually identical levels of education, employment and homeownership as the surrounding metropolis. 
 Those areas do have somewhat greater concentrations of minority residents and single mothers, and slightly lower incomes. But they are no more prone to outright poverty.
 ''It looks a lot better than I would have guessed,'' said Myron Orfield, a law professor at the University of Minnesota who studies regional inequality. ''I would have guessed that Katrina families would have been relocated in tracts much more disadvantaged and more segregated than the region as a whole.''
 Jesse Rothstein, a Princeton economist, agreed. ''These are better neighborhoods than I would have expected,'' Mr. Rothstein said.
 The real contrast for evacuees is with the neighborhoods they have left behind.
 In the flooded neighborhoods of New Orleans, annual household income was $27,000. In the average evacuee's tract in Atlanta, it is $52,000.
 In New Orleans, 42 percent of the neighborhood children were poor. In evacuee tracts in Atlanta, the rate is 12 percent.
 In New Orleans, about half the child-rearing families in the flood zones had fathers in their homes. In evacuee tracts in Atlanta, nearly three-quarters do.
 ''I love New Orleans, don't get me wrong,'' Ms. Marcell said. ''But I thank God we are in Atlanta.''
 The pattern of resettlement may have been shaped in part by the success of previous migrations. Some evacuees turned first to family or friends prosperous enough to take them in, then settled nearby -- a subtle form of upward steering.
 The Marcells are a good example. They started at Mr. Marcell's mother's house, three exits away on Interstate 20 from where they live now. Since the Marcells were still on the public housing rolls -- they had not officially left the projects -- they received a voucher from the federal government for 18 months' rent at a private apartment. They wanted one near a good school, and a friend suggested Stoneview Elementary. 
 On a recent morning, Rashad left home just past 8 looking like a cover of Vibe magazine, with a Pepe Jeans jacket and Size 4 Timberland boots. His back bent from a bulging pack, he walked three blocks to school and entered a classroom trailer, where his teacher, David Smith, fussed at his fourth-grade charges. 
 ''Remember: a person who will not read '' Mr. Smith began.
 A chorus roared back: '' is no better than a person who cannot read!''
 Demographically, Stoneview fits the stereotype of a troubled urban school. More than 90 percent of its students are black, and 85 percent receive a subsidized lunch. Only 23 percent of fifth graders exceed state standards on reading tests, about half the metro average.
 Still, a tone of crisp purpose is set by its principal, Farrell Young. Parents from New Orleans marvel at the automated phone calls they get whenever a student fails to check in. While few Stoneview students ace the reading test, 81 percent pass it, not far off the metropolitan Atlanta average of 89 percent. 
 Among evacuees, it is an article of faith that the local schools far surpass those back home. For Ms. Marcell, Exhibit A is Mr. Smith, who has been quick to call her whenever Rashad seems down. ''Mr. Smith really cares,'' Ms. Marcell said.
 By the time the bell rang, Rashad had crowded onto the floor beside classmates to imagine a slave ship's hold; written a paragraph about ice cream; divided 4,133 by 5; and learned a mnemonic to track the inner planets of Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars: ''M-Vem.''
 ''What's the name of that big college in Massachusetts I want y'all to go to?'' Mr. Smith asked. ''When y'all go off to Haah-vaaad, remember 'M-Vem.'''

Two Sides of Resettlement
 Can better neighborhoods rescue the poor? Or will bad luck and habits follow wherever they land?
 Optimists may note that the United States was built on the promise of fresh starts, from the Pilgrims of Plymouth Rock to Pakistani cab drivers in Queens. A change of address has turned prairie nobodies into California gold-strike kings, and a Mississippi migrant named Oprah Winfrey into a Chicago billionaire.
 Yet migrant lore also includes its special brand of the blues, the lament of those who discover the streets are not paved with gold.
 Don Wilson is one Stoneview parent who thinks Atlanta sparkles. Since arriving seven months ago, he has landed a job and then a promotion, to sales manager for Global HealthCare Systems, a company that sells discount cards for medical services. He said he was earning 25 percent more than he did in New Orleans as a recruiter for a technical school. ''I get to make someone's life better, and at the same time be prosperous,'' Mr. Wilson said.
 A New Orleans native, Mr. Wilson moved away, returning five years ago at the age of 40 to find a stagnant city with few prospects for blacks. In Atlanta, he sees black achievers everywhere.
 ''It's nothing to see people driving around in Mercedes, and they look like you,'' he said. ''They're black. That tells you that you could do it.''
 ''I love the environment,'' Mr. Wilson said. ''I'm really happy.''
 Sheba Akmin's reaction could not have been more different. Landing in Lithonia, Ms. Akmin, a 30-year-old hairdresser, dropped five dress sizes and developed stomach ulcers. She missed home so much she drove to New Orleans just to buy groceries, returning from the 12-hour round trip with king cakes, Bunny Bread, smoked sausages and a stash of file powder. 
 ''I wasn't familiar with the food in Atlanta,'' she said.
 The bustle that excites Mr. Wilson left Ms. Akmin drained. She was appalled that her neighbors did not know one another's names, and wounded by the rejection she got when applying for jobs. ''People in Atlanta is bougie -- they stuck up,'' she said. ''Everybody is for themselves. It's zoom, zoom, zoom.'' 
 In March, her boyfriend, a cook, reclaimed his job at a New Orleans restaurant, and she raced back home with him. ''I know there was opportunity for me'' in Atlanta, she said. ''But all I did is cry.''
 Katrina families differ from the classic American migrant in at least one important way: they did not choose to move. Simply by deciding to strike out from home, the immigrant of lore has already shown much of the drive needed to succeed. Evacuees' ambitions, unlike their neighborhoods, cannot be quantified.
 Anthony Hall, another Stoneview parent, has enrolled in DeKalb Technical School, but warned: ''A lot of people right now are waiting around. You got to get that out of your mind; Oprah can only help so many people.''
 Migrants typically prosper most in places with prosperity to share. That is why Atlanta and Houston, with more jobs at higher pay, hold a promise that New Orleans lacked. But migrations are shaped by the migrants, too, their culture, character and connections. 
 Social networks are especially important. Newcomers tend to thrive where they have friends. Mr. Wilson, the medical-card salesman, found his job through his New Orleans church, which had formed an Atlanta congregation. Ms. Akmin was isolated. ''I didn't know anybody,'' she said.
 Local reaction can also shape migrants' success. Greater Houston has more than 100,000 evacuees, whose presence is a source of growing strain. A series of high school brawls has pitted evacuees against local rivals, and displaced New Orleans gangs have been blamed in part for a surge of homicides. Mayor Bill White led a welcoming effort, but public sentiment is turning against evacuees.
 Even in metropolitan Atlanta, which has about a third as many evacuees as Houston, many complain they are being labeled freeloaders or criminals.
 For all the promise of the new neighborhoods, other problems can get in the way. The troubled New Orleans schools, for one, may have left students too far behind their new peers.
 Texas officials have estimated that Katrina students, on average, lag their new classmates by at least a full grade. In Lithonia, standardized tests show Rashad reading two years below his grade level, even though he got A's and B's back home.
 The move up may also prove short-lived if evacuees are forced into worse areas or if their current neighborhoods decline. Reviewing the Times data, Professor Orfield, the Minnesota scholar, saw one warning sign: evacuee schools looked worse than evacuee neighborhoods. They have more low-income students than schools regionwide, more minorities and lower test scores. That is worrisome, he said, because ''the schools resegregate first and the neighborhoods tend to follow.''
 In Atlanta, the tipping appears to have begun, according to the Times analysis. In the average evacuee's neighborhood, the black and Hispanic population grew to 49 percent in 2000 from 31 percent in 1990. Single motherhood also rose, and the employment rate declined.
 Another possibility is even more fundamental: what if neighborhoods matter less than commonly thought? As far back as Jacob Riis, the 19th-century crusader against slums, experts have argued that bad neighborhoods perpetuate poverty, steeping the poor in bad influences while walling them off from good schools and jobs.
 In making a parallel case, contemporary social scientists have been particularly influenced by the Gautreaux program in Chicago, which moved black families from public housing into white suburbs, where more adults found jobs and more children went on to college. Gautreaux began in 1976 and lasted two decades.
 But a successor program, Moving to Opportunity, failed to replicate the results. Operating in five cities in the 1990's, the program moved public-housing tenants of all races into neighborhoods with less poverty. An evaluation, published three years ago, showed that the transplanted adults neither worked more nor earned more than those who had stayed behind. 
 ''The process of neighborhood influence appears to be more subtle and complex than most of us thought,'' said Jeffrey Kling, a Brookings scholar who helped evaluate the program.
 Moving to Opportunity produced one clear benefit: it left the transplanted families feeling much safer. After years of housing-project violence, the Marcells revel in a similar sense of safety. ''It's a relief to be someplace where people's not shooting,'' Mr. Marcell said. 
 One reason for the otherwise disappointing results may have been the modesty of the moves. Most Moving to Opportunity participants landed in areas only marginally better than those they had left; having moved farther up the neighborhood ladder, Katrina evacuees may reap bigger benefits.
 Another explanation is that influences like family dynamics or cultural mores may matter more than neighborhoods. Among those tacitly making that case was Rashad's teacher, Mr. Smith, who recently transferred to a nearby school. 
 When Mr. Smith moved to DeKalb six years ago, he sought a school like the one where he had taught in Savannah, Ga., filled with the children of Asian immigrants. ''You talk about students who want to learn! I was drooling!'' he said. Asked how Stoneview students compared, he paused, then said, ''I don't think education is stressed, or stressed enough.''

'Go-Getters' With a Dream
 Ms. Marcell answers talk of potential pitfalls with a forecast of success, ''because we are some go-getters.'' But with both Marcells still unemployed, the go-getters have yet to get going.
 Mr. Marcell said he initially delayed a job search to stay at home with his pregnant wife. Then he applied at four stores, a restaurant and several gas stations, he said, without getting hired. He did reject an offer to drive a bus three days a week, saying he was put off by the part-time schedule. He added, ''I really don't know about bus driving down here; the streets are kind of narrow.''
 Now with his unemployment benefits extended, he is postponing his job search to focus on Rashad's career. ''I'm trying to help my son pursue his dreams,'' he said.
 Ms. Marcell also turned down a job, as a helper at a day care center; she decided to postpone work until she had the baby. Whitney Mercedes Marcell, a girl, arrived on Feb. 7, and Ms. Marcell said she planned to find a job when her daughter turns three months old.
 In the meantime, she has revived a previous business plan, pitching kitchen cabinets to the New Orleans housing authority. Officially still one of its tenants, she has an edge when bidding on the agency's contracts. Teaming up with a Mississippi manufacturer, she thought she had her first deal just before the storm, a renovation of 36 apartments that would have brought her a fee of 7 percent, or about $15,000. 
 With much of the city's public housing in need of reconstruction, Ms. Marcell is trying to finalize that deal and land new ones. ''I'm not going to let this go,'' she said. ''I worked too hard for it.''
 Though jobless, the Marcells are not destitute and have been able to replace much of what they lost to the flood. They have a new wide-screen television, a new computer and a new living-room suite. Last fall, Mr. Marcell's 1992 Chevy Suburban was stolen. Though it was uninsured against theft, he bought a newer model, and added a DVD player. 
 ''We are a hard-working family,'' Mr. Marcell said. ''We feel entitled to live comfortable.'' 
 The $400 a week they get in unemployment checks replaces only about half their former take-home pay. But insurance paid off their mortgage (giving them title to the land). And with their housing voucher they pay no rent. In net terms, the rough numbers provided by the Marcells show that their income has fallen by about $175 a week -- or by about $5,300 over seven months. 
 Against that, they have received more than $7,000 in lump-sum payments from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Red Cross and relatives. And the Marcells said they arrived in Atlanta with about $8,000 in savings. ''That's what we're really cutting into now,'' Mr. Marcell said. 
 Others in their family are off to a similarly slow job hunt. ''I'm going to wait until my little unemployment check runs out'' before going back to work, said Ms. Marcell's mother, who collected $10,000 from FEMA for the contents of her flooded apartment. After two decades in nursing homes, she said, ''I was tired of working like a dog.''
 After 26 years in a printing plant, Mr. Marcell's father, Widdon Jackson, is collecting unemployment. Keisha, the valedictorian, was in college back home, but after months in Atlanta without work or school, she left for Houston.
 The career the Marcells seem most focused on now belongs to Rashad, who raps under the name Lil' Chucky.
 ''I just hope that people like Oprah Winfrey, people like Puff Daddy, will get a chance to hear his cry,'' Mr. Marcell said. 
 '' 'Shad got a good career going,'' said Mr. Marcell's father. ''He going to make his family rich!'' 
 Their spirits soared a few months ago when Mr. Marcell got Rashad on the stage at an awards show, just yards from the rap star Ludacris. Not long after that, a bigger break seemed to appear in the form of an electronic beat, a percussive track over which original lyrics can be dubbed. The beat, recorded by an engineer named Vaughn Pacsch'l but known as Afro, borrowed its refrain from another black sitcom, ''Good Times.'' 
 ''As soon as I heard that beat, I said this is the one,'' Mr. Marcell said. A good beat can sell for $1,000 or more; Afro agreed to sell three for $500, including ''Good Times,'' and tape Rashad's version of the song. 
 For weeks, the Marcells honed their lyrics, mixing nostalgia for home with criticisms of FEMA's response to the hurricane. ''Good Times'' became ''Good Tymez.'' 
 The night of the taping, everyone was tense. Mr. Marcell idled the Suburban in a gas station parking lot and ran Rashad through practice takes. Ms. Marcell returned from the station's cash machine and counted out the money she owed Afro. Rashad, still awaiting dinner, kept messing up his lines. ''Get more aggressive!'' Mr. Marcell said.
 Shortly before 8 p.m., the Suburban rumbled into a trim subdivision where Afro answered the door in tinted glasses and braids. His wife -- a nurse hoping to make it as a singer -- introduced herself as Oracle, then said her real name was Destiny.
 Hat cocked, pants loose, ablaze with cubic zirconium, Rashad arrived with more bling than zing. He looked pooped. ''Go in the corner, get in your zone,'' Mr. Marcell said. ''You're going to be hitting this mike in a second.''
 ''What's wrong with you?'' asked Ms. Marcell. ''Loosen up.''
 Rashad did a 360-degree turn, splayed his legs, and lifted an arm, as though crowning himself with an exclamation point.
 ''Let's run it,'' Afro said.
 Rashad flubbed his first line.
 ''Show some more aggression!'' Mr. Marcell said.
 Rashad missed the second take. His timing was off on Takes 3 and 4. He garbled the words on Take 5.
 ''Come on,'' said his mother. ''Let's nail this!''

 Katrina left my city flat 
 But I'm about to bring it back 
 And we going to have a good time!

''That's it!'' Ms. Marcell said.
 Mr. Marcell glowed and growled out a verse.

 Man the government is so lazy 
 But if I woulda lost my wife and my unborn baby 
 I woulda went crazy.
 ''You sound really mad at Bush!'' Ms. Marcell laughed. ''You sound like Tupac!''
 ''It's 4:09 -- radio friendly,'' Afro said.
 It was almost 10 p.m., and Rashad had school in the morning.
 ''I'm a go home, take a bath, and go straight to bed,'' he said to no one in particular. Retakes followed, and lots of waiting, as Afro adjusted the mix. By 10:30, Rashad was asleep on the floor, and Mr. Marcell soon fell asleep there, too, after pledging to get the finished disc to a radio station first thing in the morning. 
 He dropped it off a few days later, but it was never broadcast. 
 Still, the evening left Ms. Marcell jazzed. She sat up past midnight telling Destiny her dreams, as Afro spun the dials, searching for the elusive formula for success.

HEADLINE: Immigrant Workers Find Support in a Growing Network of Assistance Centers

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
When Mulugeta Yimer, a taxi driver from Ethiopia, thought his employer was cheating him several years ago, he did not complain to the government; he went instead to a worker center called Tenants and Workers United.
 The center helped Mr. Yimer and other drivers in Alexandria, Va., win the right to keep more of their fares. Not only that, it has helped child care workers win a 70 percent raise and day laborers win back pay for minimum-wage violations.
Tenants and Workers United is one of a fast-growing number of centers that are helping the nation's 20 million immigrant workers. In many ways, these centers are doing what labor unions, fraternal organizations and settlement houses did decades ago for newcomers to the United States. 
 ''We are all from different countries and our English is broken and nobody understands us,'' said Mr. Yimer, who has driven a taxi for eight years. ''But the workers center was willing to listen to us. They provide us expertise. They provide us a lawyer. They support us.'' 
 There are more than 140 worker centers nationwide, up from roughly 25 a decade ago. The centers played a pivotal role in getting tens of thousands of workers to the giant demonstrations seeking a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants and protesting a House bill that would turn illegal immigrants into felons. 
 Some of these centers focus on a particular nationality, like Korean Immigrant Worker Advocates in Los Angeles and the Chinese Staff and Workers Association in Manhattan, while some focus on an industry, like the Mississippi Poultry Workers' Center and the New York Taxi Workers Alliance.
 Many illegal immigrants -- day laborers, gardeners, laundry workers, restaurant deliverymen -- have asked these centers for help on wage problems because the nation's legal services offices are barred from representing them. Moreover, the centers often fill the role once held by labor unions, which represent less than 6 percent of low-wage workers.
 ''You have a vacuum created by the decline of organized labor,'' said John Liss, executive director of Tenants and Workers United. ''What we're seeing is a new immigrant working class creating their own voice.'' 
 The centers teach immigrants English and how to file wage complaints. They have persuaded communities to build shelters for day laborers, who often stand in the rain and cold without bathroom facilities. They have helped push for higher minimum wages in several states, and some centers have won more than $1 million in back pay for immigrants who were cheated.
 ''These centers have taken off because we're seeing an increase in the number of workers in precarious employment situations,'' said Janice Fine, a professor of labor relations at Rutgers and author of ''Worker Centers: Organizing Communities at the Edge of the Dream'' (2006).
 ''Over the past decade we've seen the biggest influx of immigrants in our nation's history and at the same time a decline in resources for wage and hour enforcement at the state and federal level,'' Professor Fine said. ''These centers have become a safety net that's tried to enforce the laws.''
 Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that supports stricter immigration controls, voiced ambivalence about these centers.
 ''The bad part is these groups become lobbies for illegal aliens,'' Mr. Krikorian said. ''On the other hand, they help people stiffed out of their wages. That can serve a purpose because it raises the price of hiring illegal aliens, and the more it costs to hire illegal aliens, the more employers might turn to legal workers.'' 
 Many centers survive hand to mouth, relying on foundation money, government grants, grass-roots fund-raising and, to a small degree, dues. The Chicago Interfaith Worker Rights Center charges its 150 members $5 each to join.
 ''These centers have gotten smarter over the years,'' said Jennifer Gordon, founder of the Workplace Project in Hempstead, N.Y., one of the first worker centers. ''They are turning victories that would have just been a back-pay award into something more.''
 After accusing a chain of sneaker stores of wage violations, Make the Road by Walking, based in Brooklyn, helped the chain's 95 workers unionize. The Coalition of Immokalee Workers, a Florida-based group of farmworkers, pressed Taco Bell into making its tomato growers pay their workers more, and has begun a similar campaign against McDonald's. The Restaurant Opportunities Center pressed two fashionable Manhattan restaurants, Cite and the Park Avenue Cafe, to pay $164,000 in back wages and give workers three days of sick pay and one week of vacation each year.
 At Tenants and Workers United, Sylvia Portillo, the group's health coordinator, assists immigrants who ran up large medical bills when they went to emergency rooms with broken bones or severe illnesses. Ms. Portillo, a nurse who left El Salvador in the 1980's, has persuaded several charities and hospitals to reduce immigrants' bills. 
 Each year, she oversees a health fair that attracts several hundred immigrants who receive free tests for blood pressure, H.I.V. and diabetes. Similarly, the Taxi Workers Alliance provides free medical tests to drivers as they wait in line at Kennedy Airport.
 ''Five years ago everyone went to the emergency room for everything,'' Ms. Portillo said. ''Now we educate the people. We tell them the emergency room is only for emergencies, maybe a broken leg.''
 Tenants and Workers United has helped persuade the Alexandria City Council to give Mr. Yimer and other drivers the right to change taxi companies. The group also persuaded the City of Alexandria to raise wages for several hundred child care workers, and it has tracked down employers when immigrants were not paid the promised amount or when their paychecks bounced.
 ''Often all it takes is a phone call to employers to get back pay,'' Professor Fine said. ''Because there is so little government enforcement in low-wage industries, many employers are counting on nobody to be there to stop them.''
 Leaders of many worker centers say they doubt they will ever achieve sweeping legislative or economic change because their finances are so weak and because so many of their members are illegal immigrants who are scared to speak up.
 ''It's a mistake to think of the workers center movement as being a replacement for organized labor,'' said Bill Beardall, a co-founder of the Central Texas Immigrant Worker Rights Center in Austin, Tex., which began as a legal services office that helped farmworkers.
 Professor Fine's research found that ethnic organizations established one-fourth of the centers, while churches and religion-based organizations founded another fourth.
 The Chicago Interfaith Worker Rights Center recently helped a Chinese worker who said he had been held in virtual slavery by a Michigan restaurant, and a Mexican roofer who said his employer left him for dead in a Dumpster after he fell.
 The center has printed brochures in Spanish, Russian and Polish that tell workers their rights. It also gives leadership classes.
 ''We try to get workers to think more systematically,'' said Jose Oliva, the center's executive director. ''That means creating some workers' organizations that have power and can negotiate some changes.''
 The four worker centers in Chicago helped push through a state law that requires agencies that use day laborers to register and pay workers' compensation and unemployment insurance taxes. The centers also advised a state commission that examined the higher fatality rate for Hispanic workers. 
 ''These centers have brought some serious labor violations to the attention of the Department of Labor,'' said Esther Lopez, deputy chief of staff to Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich of Illinois. ''Without their help, some of these workers would not come forward.''

HEADLINE: In New Orleans, Dean Criticizes G.O.P. on Lack of Aid

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, April 22 

 BODY:
Howard Dean, the Democratic National Committee chairman, offered a broad attack on the Republican Party on Saturday, saying the White House has ''cut and run'' in its approach to rebuilding this hurricane-ravaged region. 
 ''Our current Republican government will be judged by how they treated Americans on our Gulf Coast, and how that government has mistreated our American community,'' Mr. Dean said. ''The Republicans have cut and run when it comes to rebuilding the Gulf Coast.''
Mr. Dean said Democrats attending the party's spring meeting here had been dispatched across the area over the past three days, helping with cleanup and charity missions.
 ''Here in the Gulf Coast and around the country, we have seen our American community coming together as Americans, as we have in our responses this weekend,'' he said. ''That's what we do as Americans: We band together, and we don't leave anybody behind.''
 His remarks underlined the extent to which Democrats have seized on the disaster here to illustrate what Mr. Dean said were the failures of the Bush administration. After Louisiana officials thanked the party for holding its meeting here, Mr. Dean suggested that the Democrats return for their nominating convention in 2008.
 One of the officials, Mayor C. Ray Nagin, reminded Democrats of the problems they face as they try to win back Congress this November.
 ''Recent polls say the American people would like to see Democrats in Congress, and I agree with those polls,'' Mr. Nagin said. ''But we are having a little problem finding the talent, finding a clear message and connecting with the people. This is our time.''
 Tracey Schmitt, a spokesman for the Republican Party, responded to Mr. Dean's remarks, saying: ''The Democrats' blame game rings hollow with Americans who prefer solutions over partisan attacks. While Howard Dean and his party remain committed to exploiting a great tragedy, this president remains committed to rebuilding the Gulf Coast, expanding our growing economy and winning the war on terror.''

HEADLINE: At the World Bank, Wolfowitz Works on Improving His Image

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 22 

 BODY:
At the opening of the annual spring meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund on Thursday, a small group of protesters chanted, ''Corporate corruption, who can we thank?/ The I.M.F. and the World Bank!''
 In less than a minute, security guards hustled the noisy protesters out of the news conference. 
That the moment, captured in Webcasts, fizzled so quickly was a sign of the surprising lack of controversy surrounding the 10-month tenure of Paul D. Wolfowitz as president of the World Bank, one of the most important antipoverty institutions.
 Mr. Wolfowitz, a former Pentagon official who became a lightning rod for criticism of the Iraq war and who was mocked by filmmaker Michael Moore in ''Fahrenheit 9/11'' for fussing with his hair, has defused much of the opposition from advocacy groups. 
 Early in his tenure, he worked behind the scenes to push for debt relief, a cause popularized by the rock star Bono. On Friday, he announced that he had enough votes from bank shareholders to approve $37 billion in debt relief to 17 of the world's poorest countries, mostly in Africa.
 ''He didn't have to do that,'' said Max Lawson, a policy adviser with Oxfam.
 Mr. Wolfowitz has laid claim to the mantle of anticorruption crusader. In recent months, he has blocked or canceled more than $1 billion in loans to a range of developing countries. But he has done it in a way that appealed to both conservatives, who worry that aid is disappearing down a rat hole, and to anticorporate activists who fear that it is being stolen from the poor by corrupt rulers and the businessmen who bribe them.
 He has also on occasion shown a willingness to nip the hand of the Bush administration that used to feed him -- a tendency that has lessened suspicions that his appointment to head the World Bank would simply impose American interests. At a news conference on Friday, he gently chided the United States for the relatively small sums it gives to help educate the 100 million children in the developing world who are not in school.
 Certainly there is harsh criticism of Mr. Wolfowitz, but it seems tempered by a sense that his approach offers a chance for change at the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, a lumbering institution often berated as secretive, bureaucratic and ineffective in dispensing billions of dollars in very low interest loans each year to poor countries.
 At a bacon-and-eggs news conference on Friday morning at the Old Ebbitt Grill, a clutch of advocacy groups -- with leaders from India, the Czech Republic and the Philippines -- laid out some of their recommendations for reform. 
 The bank needs stronger protections for its own whistleblowers, they said. It should forgive debts incurred by thieving dictators. Its lending should be subjected to parliamentary oversight in developing countries with vital democracies. And it needs to even more comprehensively investigate allegations of corruption, especially those involving multinational corporations.
 ''This is a very important window in which we're making a number of constructive suggestions,'' said Smitu Kothari, director of Intercultural Resources, a New Delhi-based nonprofit research group. 
 While Mr. Kothari did not criticize Mr. Wolfowitz's decision to hold up $660 million in lending to support India's health programs for women, children and victims of tuberculosis because of corruption in drug procurement, India's health minister, Dr. Anbumani Ramadoss, called the action unfair. India is the bank's largest borrower. 
 That decision might once have prompted India, famously prickly about foreign hands in its affairs, to spurn Mr. Wolfowitz and his loans. But the new India, deeply engaged with the United States, is trying to accommodate him.
 ''I've done everything the World Bank asked,'' Dr. Ramadoss said during a telephone interview on Thursday. ''I have blacklisted all the companies they wanted. I've suspended officials there at that point in time.''
 As well as highlighting his anticorruption theme, Mr. Wolfowitz has emphasized another cause during these spring meetings -- education. This week he appeared on a panel with Gordon Brown, th chancellor of the exchequer in Britain, and Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the Nigerian finance minister, to discuss education aid. 
 Mr. Brown, who last week announced that Britain was committing $15 billion to education in the coming decade, four times what it spent in the past decade, said, ''It is one of the world's greatest scandals that must now be addressed that 100 million children are not going to school today.'' 
 Mrs. Okonjo-Iweala began by telling how she had recently adopted a 17-year-old girl who had never had a chance to get an education, and who is now being privately tutored. 
 The Nigerian minister said children needed to be able to read and write if they were ever to escape poverty, and invited donors to contribute to help education in the developing world. 
 When the panel was asked who the laggards were among the donors, the audience tittered, and Mr. Wolfowitz took the question. He praised the British and the Dutch for their outstanding contributions. As for the United States, he said, it has raised its spending on education from about $100 million in 2002 to $260 million in 2004. 
 ''If you stop and think about it, that's about $1 per capita, whereas I think the U.K. number is now up to $20 per capita,'' he said. ''So the U.S. could do a lot more.''

HEADLINE: Food Festival in Chinatown Draws Thousands, but Chilly Rain Forces Early Closing

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
It was the Year of the Brrrrrr yesterday for a sidewalk food festival offering Asian bonne bouches at discount prices. Despite an unseasonable drizzle and chill, thousands of fans of dim sum crowded nine blocks of Chinatown that were closed off from traffic.
 Known as Taste of Chinatown, the festival was the latest attempt to lift the lagging restaurant business in one of the world's largest Chinese districts, where gentrification, scant parking and the Sept. 11, 2001, destruction of the nearby World Trade Center have combined to drag down the neighborhood's economy. 
''It's a little crazy, but fun,'' said Julie Dahl, 26, a legal assistant living in Greenwich Village, who brought along two friends to sample dim sum, a Cantonese phrase that has been translated as ''little heart'' or ''heart's delight,'' or just appetizer.
 Emily Pecot, 26, a film script supervisor who lives in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, stood in line for a half-hour for an especially popular table at Peking Duck House. After she finished a dumpling, Ms. Pecot said, ''You can spend, I don't know, $50, if you wanted, for Peking duck and this way you only have to spend $2.''
 But John Traugott, 68, a hospital chaplain in Rockaway Park, Queens hinted at some of Chinatown's problems. He said that even though he and his wife, who is Taiwanese, come to Chinatown once every two weeks, they go more often to Chinese restaurants and stores in Flushing, Queens.
 ''It's a little closer and there's usually free parking,'' he said. ''That's very hard to do here in Chinatown. We're going to spend $25 for 3 hours of parking today.''
 Like other neighborhoods in Manhattan, where real estate values have soared in recent years, parking lots, garages, and street parking have turned scarce as residential developments replace them, Chinatown community advocates say.
 Moreover, nearby Wall Street has become more residential, putting added pressure on parking and removing customers from Chinatown businesses since a growing number of Wall Street residents work far away from Chinatown.
 But what might have taken years or even decades to hurt Chinatown accelerated into a single moment when the World Trade Center was destroyed. So, like salt in food, the center's financial support for the neighborhood economy was only noticed when it was gone.
 Bonnie Wong, president of Asian Women in Business and the principal organizer of Taste of Chinatown, said: ''Chinatown jewelers lost 25 percent of their business, just like that, because customers, mostly men, could walk to Chinatown to shop. They couldn't walk to the Diamond District,'' more than three miles to the north. 
 The three sectors hit worst by the 9/11 recession -- restaurants, jewelers and gift shops -- were all small businesses unaccustomed to working together, Ms. Wong said.
 Festivals, like Taste of Chinatown, are designed not only to educate consumers in adding more restaurants to their list of Chinatown favorites, but also to educate the restaurant owners themselves, who may never have cooperated with businesses next door to them or considered opening longer hours to accommodate customers.
 Fifty-one restaurants in the heart of Chinatown -- Mott, Mulberry, Bayard and Pell Streets -- banded together for the festival, which was also sponsored by Multicultural Radio Broadcasting of New York, NBC television and The New York Times.
 Nine of the group are rated 20 or higher in the Zagat Survey for the quality of the food. (The ''21'' Club is rated 22).
 Most of the restaurants and bakeries lose money when they offer dishes like Peking duck crepes for $2 each, or green soy pea cooked in wine, roast pork buns, or sticky wild rice sie mai for $1 each. 
 Yesterday's festival was the fourth such event since October 2004, when it attracted only a few thousand eaters, Ms. Wong said. Last April, however, an estimated 35,000 crowded Chinatown for five hours. 
 Yesterday, after the festival opened at 1 p.m., the rain dampened the crowds around 3:30 p.m., and many restaurants pulled in their tables.
 Most of the crowd was Asian, meaning the number of new customers may have been limited. Ms. Wong said that many visitors find it hard to believe that Chinatown is in a recession because the sidewalks are so crowded with tourists. But that is on the weekends; businesses suffer on the weekdays, she said.
 What Chinatown needs, Ms. Wong said, is not only tourists from Arkansas and Italy, but regular customers from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.
 To help with that, the next project for her group and other community advocates is a nighttime Taste of Chinatown, only this time for jewelers and gift shops. No word yet on whether wind chimes will cost $1.

HEADLINE: Plant That Brewed Beer Shifts Attention to Ethanol

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: FULTON, N.Y., April 19 

 BODY:
Sometimes Rick O'Shea still hears the beer bottles clanking in the shadows of the old Miller Brewing plant here, where he worked until the place closed more a decade ago. 
 Now he is the engineering director of a project aiming to turn the ghostly, 420-acre complex into the Northeast's first ethanol production plant, churning biofuel out of the massive vats that once brewed Miller Lite.
''Every vessel you see is going to be reused,'' said Mr. O'Shea, 50, standing in the darkened plant's west brewhouse before two stainless steel kettles, each large enough to hold 45,000 gallons of beer. ''We've got fermentation tanks, we've got cooking vessels, that's what lured the ethanol project here.'' 
 With gas costing $3 a gallon in many parts of the country and much of the oil producing world in turmoil, the lure of homegrown fuel is a powerful one. Gov. George E. Pataki is intent on making the state the vanguard of ethanol production in the Northeast, and the Fulton plant is one of the projects in the region that is closest to fruition. 
 Certainly, there is a market. New environmental regulations are spurring a rapid rise in demand for ethanol this year as a replacement for Methyl tert-butyl ether, a gasoline additive better known as MTBE that has been linked to groundwater contamination. 
 But in the United States, ethanol has always been a Midwestern fuel, and one of limited environmental benefit because it is made from corn, which requires considerable resources to grow and harvest. 
 Now, New York is investing millions of dollars in research on corn-free ethanol. The State University of New York is spearheading that effort, which would produce ethanol using chips from willow trees instead. 
 ''We pull out the things that are normally thrown away by a pulp and paper mill,'' said Neil Murphy, the president of SUNY's College of Environmental Science and Forestry in Syracuse, which is also working with an International Paper plant in Ticonderoga, N.Y. 
 Essentially, the goal is to use the willow chips to make paper in Ticonderoga and then ship a syrupy byproduct to Fulton, where it can be brewed into ethanol, also known as grain alcohol. 
 Not that the process is ready for prime time. Mass production using this approach is largely untested. 
 So the owners of the Fulton plant, a fledgling local company called Northeast Biofuels, hope to start by producing corn-based ethanol at the beginning of 2008, and plan to later experiment with ethanol from wood chips. They formed a partnership with an established Canadian ethanol producer, Permolex, and even received a $3 million loan from the pension funds of two union locals in the Syracuse region who see jobs in the reconstruction of the brewery. 
 ''Ultimately, where is the demand for ethanol going to be?'' asked Eric W. Will II, one of the owners of Northeast Biofuels. ''It's going to be where the automobiles are, where you need the motor fuels, and that's called the East Coast and the West Coast.''
 Douglas Brent, the co-chairman of Permolex, said that building plants closer to areas densely populated with cars was ''the future of the industry.''
 ''It's pretty easy to transport corn, pretty hard to transport ethanol,'' he added. 
 The project could bring some jobs back to a region that has seen an exodus of both people and manufacturing work. The Miller plant, which once employed 1,200 people, is on a stretch of land abutted by Interstate 481 and the Oswego River, as well as train tracks that would carry corn from the Midwest. A 40-foot-high Miller sign leans against the side of the plant. 
 ''Miller installed that back in the mid-80's,'' Mr. O'Shea said. He pointed to a 180-foot high pole nearby. ''It used to be on top of the pole and had a clutch on it. It would tether in the wind, light up at night and rotate.''
 Mr. O'Shea started at the plant at 24, in 1979, working as a shift supervisor in the boiler house. Perks included three free cases of beer a month. He still remembers the December day in 1993 when Miller called workers into the warehouse to tell them the plant was going to close. 
 In the years afterward, he said, ''I would drive by this gigantic place and just shake my head, having put 15 years in here,'' he said. ''My wife called it an obsession.''
 For several years, he has been part of a crew overseeing the plant, and taking part in a restoration effort has been therapeutic, he said. 
 Mr. Will, whose family started the Will & Baumer candle company in the Syracuse area a century and a half ago, bought the brewery in 2000, along with a partner. The project, coming at a time when demand for ethanol was more modest, got off to a slow start. 
 ''Wall Street didn't know anything about ethanol,'' Mr. Will said. ''They didn't even know what questions to ask.''
 In the current climate, even a dedicated oil man like President Bush is talking up ethanol and wood chips, most prominently in his last State of the Union address. There has also been a movement to make ethanol more widely available as a primary motor fuel rather than selling it as just an additive. 
 There are already more than four million cars and trucks on the road that have the option of running on a blend of 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline, known as E85, but only roughly 500 gas stations in the nation sell it. In the Northeast, there are no public gas stations where you can buy E85. 
 That will soon change. Governor Pataki, whose government-issued Chevrolet Suburban runs on E85, recently put in place an initiative to bring ethanol and other alternative fuels to the service stations on the New York State Thruway, beginning this year. His budget also included $20 million for production of non corn-based ethanol, though last week a dispute with the Legislature led him to veto his own proposed tax credits for ethanol production. 
 Bringing ethanol to the state, he said in a statement this week, would ''provide New Yorkers with a clean, affordable homegrown fuel.''
 For Mr. Will, it is also a chance to bring a new kind of business to a region badly in need of economic development. 
 ''This is where I live, my four kids live here,'' he said. ''We have to undertake projects and initiatives to keep people around.''

PERSON: George C. Minden

HEADLINE: George C. Minden, 85, Dies; Led a Cold War of Words

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
George C. Minden, who for 37 years ran a secret American program that put 10 million Western books and magazines in the hands of intellectuals and professionals in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, died on April 9 at his home in Manhattan. He was 85.
 The cause was complications of gastric lymphoma, his son John said. 
Mr. Minden was president of the International Literary Center, an organization financed by the Central Intelligence Agency, which tried to win influential friends by giving them reading material unavailable in their own countries. The material ranged from dictionaries, medical texts and novels by Joyce and Nabokov to art museum catalogs and Parisian fashion magazines.
 The people who received the reading matter were generally Communists or professionals and intellectuals working for Communist regimes. They thought the books were being donated by Western publishers and cultural organizations.
 The C.I.A.'s purpose was to offer an alternative, culturally engaging reality that had the implicit effect of promoting Western culture. Mr. Minden did not see a need to bluntly refute Marxist dogma, on the theory that people could use common sense and their own observations to reject Communist arguments.
 The project became something of a personalized book club; files were kept on recipients' reading tastes, so as to better satisfy them in the future. It replaced earlier, frankly propagandistic programs, including mass dropping of anti-Communist leaflets from high-altitude balloons.
 Mr. Minden wrote in an internal memo that the West's main obstacle was ''not Marxist obstacles, but a vacuum,'' and that ''what is needed is something against frustration and stultification, against a life full of omissions.''
 He went on to say that the objective should be to give Eastern Europeans ''a feeling of communion in this world, integration into the spiritual life of our age, and the knowledge that they have not been abandoned.''
 John P. C. Matthews wrote in 2003 in The International Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence -- in one of the few public discussions of the program -- that the initiative sprinkled reality into an ''unnatural and ultimately irrational'' system. 
 When Communism collapsed, in Eastern Europe in 1989 and in the Soviet Union in 1991, Mr. Matthews, who had worked in the book program, suggested that Mr. Minden had laid the foundation for a smoother relationship among opinion leaders in a post-Communist world. 
 ''Intellectuals in the East understood intellectuals in the West because they had been reading the same books,'' he wrote.
 George Caputineanu Minden was born on Feb. 19, 1921, in Bucharest, Romania, where he grew up in a wealthy, cosmopolitan household. He learned to speak six languages, including Latin, and at 18 he inherited an estate that included vast oil fields.
 He graduated at the top of his class from the University of Bucharest's law school. In 1946, as the Communists were taking control of Romania, he fled to England with his first wife, Margarete Schmidt. His lands and fortune were confiscated.
 He taught at Cambridge and studied at the London School of Economics, then left England after his marriage collapsed. He taught languages in Spain and Mexico and was a director of a small automobile company in Paris.
 In Madrid, he met Marilyn Miller, an American, whom he married in 1954. They moved to New York, where Mr. Minden became head of the Romanian desk at Free Europe Press, an affiliate of Radio Free Europe.
 In addition to his wife, he is survived by three sons, Nicholas, of Lausanne, Switzerland, John, of Manhattan, and Paul, of Los Angeles; a daughter, Michaela Duffy of Manhattan; four grandchildren; and one great-grandchild.
 The book mailings began in July 1956, and Mr. Minden took over the program, which has had several names, that year. An early idea was to send a publisher's catalog, inviting people to make one or two choices. A note usually suggested that the recipient send a book in return to make it appear a legitimate exchange, even though the Western publisher in reality had no use for books in Eastern European languages.
 All materials were sent to specific individuals, not to institutions, with addresses often coming from local telephone books. They were sent under the ''sponsorship'' of a cover organization. Some, like the publishers, were real; others were bogus.
 In November 1957, Mr. Minden asked the Whitney Museum of American Art to send 300 copies of a newly published book, ''Three Hundred Years of American Painting,'' to art departments, museums and artists in Eastern Europe. Time magazine reported that scores of recipients sent warm letters of appreciation.
 A literary weekly in Czechoslovakia responded to the Time article by criticizing ''the malicious trick,'' while hastening to add that it loved the book. Well beyond the program's end in 1993, the C.I.A. permitted no publicity about it. Mr. Minden's commitment to secrecy was so complete that few who knew him had any knowledge of his mission.
 In 2005, Ludmilla Thorne, an employee of the program, wrote a letter to The New Yorker that noted the program's ingenuity in distributing books and acknowledged that it was financed by the C.I.A. She said that members of the Moscow Philharmonic slipped book pages into their sheet music and that a young woman flying from London to Moscow with her infant son squeezed a mini-edition of Solzhenitsyn's ''Gulag Archipelago'' into the child's diaper.
 By 1991, more than 300,000 books and magazines were being distributed annually, making the overall total more than 10 million. Fully a third of the recipients in later years sent thank-you letters, which along with many other papers, Mr. Minden donated to the Hoover Institution of War, Revolution and Peace.
 In a letter the institution sent last August requesting the papers, it cited Mr. Minden's ''great work which has made a very significant contribution to the peaceful transformation of Eastern Europe.''
 Perhaps 1,000 people in publishing knew about the program, because they were participants. Intellectuals in the Soviet Union and its satellites marveled at the altruism of the publishers they thought of as their benefactors. (Mr. Matthews pointed out that the publishers made a tidy and certain profit.)
 Mr. Minden was noticed by the Czech secret police, who wrote in their journal about a mysterious, immaculately dressed ''man in a gray suit'' who kept turning up at Czech exile centers, Mr. Matthews wrote.
 But the police never mentioned Mr. Minden's name or gave any indication that they knew about his ''Marshall Plan for the mind.''

HEADLINE: If You Can Make It Out of Here, You'll Make It Out Anywhere

BYLINE: By ALAN FEUER; Kareem Fahim and Michelle O'Donnell contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Only in New York do people say, ''Only in New York,'' but only in New York will victims of a blackout have a party, will a jobless man keep a huge pet tiger in his house and, as happened last week, will emergency officials have to use a diesel-powered basket to rescue commuters dangling high above a river in a red metal tram. 
 In this city, things are not the way they are out there in what is known as the United States. The streets are meaner, the buildings taller and the talk cheaper. And if one considers the unusual events that unfolded Tuesday night and Wednesday morning 200 feet above the East River as any sort of measure, then even rescue operations are hairier than most.
No one was injured -- let alone killed -- when the Roosevelt Island Tramway got stuck and police and fire officials tried for 11 hours to get it unstuck. Despite the sweat and creativity, however, the rescue was not exactly a well-oiled machine. It was more MacGyver than MacArthur. 
 In a spirit of public paranoia, The New York Times came up with five other places you would not want to get stuck and presented them to the Fire and Police Departments to see how they would respond. All the situations were unique to New York, and none were related to terrorism. 
 Our findings are below.

Water Tunnel No. 3
 The deepest point of Tunnel No. 3, which is being drilled beneath the city to enhance its water supply, is in Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx, where it reaches a depth of 600 feet. Should a sandhog working underground get caught, say, beneath a rock-hauling cart, firefighters would have to descend hundreds of feet by the service elevator, or by stairs, to get him out.
 ''If the electricity's still working,'' said John Norman, deputy assistant chief of the Fire Department's Special Operations Command, ''we're going to take the elevator.''
 Chief Norman said the first step was reconnaissance, which is crucial in this case because a tunnel rescue can sometimes last eight hours. An officer will typically descend with two firefighters to determine whether the worker is trapped beneath a 15-ton cart or one of its heavier 30-ton brothers. 
 Hoists and air bags would be used to lift the cart, he said, so that the worker could squirm free. If he was injured, he would be placed in a stokes basket, a heavy-duty stretcher designed for hoisting, then hauled up with a rope.
 The tricky part of tunnel work is actually the temperature, which can be as much as 40 degrees lower than on the surface. 
 ''If you send someone in shirtsleeves, and it's 95 degrees outside and 55 down below, you could be almost hypothermic,'' Chief Norman said.

The Wonder Wheel At Coney Island
 Your cousin from Cleveland has persuaded you, against your better judgment, to ride the Wonder Wheel, and, at the 150-foot summit, it comes to a halt. 
 The power is out. How do you get down?
 Step 1, Chief Norman said, is to call in one of the department's 95-foot-tall tower ladders as a base of operations. Rescue workers would then climb the wheel's steel skeleton, using ropes, clips and nylon webbing as safeguards.
 With the stokes basket or a special seatlike device called a diaper harness, they would then lower riders either to the ladder's platform or onto the ground.
 The Fire Department has actually been itching for a chance to practice on the Wonder Wheel, Chief Norman said, and officials have gone so far as to stand at its base, planning rescues from below. 
 So far, however, the department has not been allowed to use the wheel for drills because of liability concerns. Chief Norman said its owners asked him, ''You want to climb out there for what?'' For practice, he told them.
 The answer, he said, was no. 

On the Skyfari Tram At the Bronx Zoo
 You are riding high above the veld when, suddenly, your cable car stops. Above you: a blue Bronx sky. Below you: lions. 
 The first thing the Fire Department does? ''Talk to the zoo people,'' Chief Norman said. 
 ''If they're stuck over the lions, you have the zoo move the animals in their cages and set up the tower ladder where it's most advantageous.''
 There is, in fact, a rescue gondola on the Skyfari tram, which goes as high as 150 feet above the ground. But if the rescue gondola, which is powered by a generator, failed as well, rescue workers would use the stokes basket or the diaper harness to lower passengers to the ground, Chief Norman said.
 The Police Department, which also handles rescues, had a similar plan, saying Emergency Service Unit officers would use a crane leased by the zoo to raise a ''man basket'' to the gondola to take the stranded passengers down. The tricky part, said Sgt. Franco Barberio, would be securing the gondola to the basket so that no one would fall.

In a Commuter Helicopter Sinking in the East River
 If you were sinking in a helicopter that had just crashed in the East River, your fate would most likely rest in the hands of the Police Department's Harbor Unit. The unit's 26 divers have been taught how to survive such a crash in what is known as ''dunk training,'' said Assistant Chief Charles Kammerdener, commander of the department's special operations division.
 Chief Kammerdener said the first step in the rescue would be to locate the downed craft, no small feat in the river's cold, cloudy currents. The divers know they must act fast, he said: The helicopter's chassis will fill up like a bathtub, and it will often flip over, disorienting anyone who removed his seatbelt too soon.
 Once the aircraft is found, he said, the divers approach with caution; after all, there might be jagged metal edges that could rip an airtight suit. 
 Even after popping out the windows and pulling the passengers free, there could be further hazards on the surface, like an oil slick, he said.

Faulty Scaffolding On the Empire State Building
 Believe it or not, a window washer trapped on scaffolding at a building like the Empire State is ''a very routine thing,'' said Deputy Chief Bill Siegel, who runs the Fire Department's rescue services division. ''We do it all the time.''
 Chief Siegel said the first thing to do in such a situation is to fix the motor on the scaffolding, should it be broken. Failing that, he said, his 10-man, state-certified team of rescuers will go to work, lowering a kernmantel rope and harness to the victim below.
 ''We make contact through a window,'' the chief said, ''then put the rope on right away so he can't go anywhere. Once the rope is on, we can take our time.''
 If the victim is hurt or needs help with the ropes, a firefighter will descend to the scaffolding, known in the rescue trade as a four-to-ones because of their ability, by way of pulleys, to make people feel as though they weigh only a quarter of their real weight.
 The rope work itself is fairly simple, Chief Siegel said. The victim is either winched up to a window on the floor above or lowered to the floor below.
 ''It's not rocket science; it's training, training and more training,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Rejected? At This Age?

BYLINE: By Susan Brenna. 
Susan Brenna is a freelance writer who last wrote for Education Life about video game majors.

 BODY:
WAYNE THORSEN dropped out of high school at 16 when his family moved from Washington State to the Philippines. When he returned to the United States he joined the Army, then entered the Reserves and started selling bonds on Wall Street. It didn't take long to realize that no matter how brilliant his sales numbers were, he would never get the big promotions.
 ''When you have a G.E.D. from the Army at Fort McClellan, Ala., class of Tuesday, they look at you like they might catch something from you,'' says Mr. Thorsen, now 33. ''No matter what you do, there's a ceiling where you're just not going to get anywhere without an education, and preferably an Ivy League one.''
Mr. Thorsen saved assiduously, sold his apartment for tuition money and applied to the baccalaureate program for adult students at the College of General Studies at Columbia University. 
 He was turned down.
 Who knew that an applicant to an adult education program needed to ''build an admissions package''? But that's what a Columbia adviser counseled Mr. Thorsen. After earning excellent grades for two semesters at another adult program, he reapplied to Columbia and was admitted. 
 Because continuing education programs are the cash cows of higher education, energetically marketed to adults who need educational assists to get ahead, the common wisdom is that anyone can get in. But admissions requirements to bachelor's programs at top-tier colleges actually range widely, from forgiving to impressively steep. 
 The defining difference seems to be this: Applicants can expect to face the highest hurdles when the barrier is porous between continuing education programs and classrooms filled with whiz kids straight out of high school. The bar is far lower at programs that put adults in separate classes, only some of which might be taught by full-time faculty members. 
 Columbia's School of General Studies, which places older students with traditional-age students at Columbia College, has in recent years admitted 39 percent to 44 percent of applicants. 
 Wellesley College admits only about a quarter of the applicants to its Davis Scholars program for women 24 and over, who attend the same classes as younger students. ''We're not offering a different Wellesley degree,'' says its dean of admissions, Jennifer Desjarlais, explaining why most are turned away. ''Faculty have the same expectation of Davis degree candidates as they do of traditional students.'' 
 Eighty to 100 adults apply each year to the Resumed Undergraduate Education program at Brown, and about 10 are admitted. ''We're almost at the point where we're competing with the typical applicant pool for selectivity,'' says Perry Ashley, executive associate dean for the undergraduate college and director of the adult program. The admissions process for students 25 and older may be different -- a faculty committee reviews transcripts, recommendations, life experience and special circumstances -- but adults pay the same tuition and attend the same full schedule of classes as other undergraduates. 
 Applicants must make strong arguments for their ability to do Ivy League-quality work. But it's cost, not quality of applicant, that limits the number admitted to Brown. Its need-blind admissions policy does not apply to nontraditional students. Mr. Ashley says that qualified applicants who need help paying tuition will not be admitted unless sufficient institutional aid is available to finance their educations. 
 Though many of these programs do not require SAT or ACT scores from applicants who might have attended high school during the first Bush presidency, they look hard at high school transcripts and any college grades earned. They require essays, and judge them for grammar and style as well as the story: why this G.E.D.-holder or that retired entrepreneur wants to go to college. 
 Many require interviews. Personalized contact between applicants and admissions officers is the rule, in part because adults bring wildly disparate histories and sets of circumstances. These require an individualized look, says Curtis Rodgers, Columbia's associate dean of admissions for general studies. 
 Admissions officers, he says, try to ''suss out'' in conversations whether applicants who have middling academic records or test scores but are accomplished in other ways ''can add to the academic discourse in the same way a Columbia College student can.'' 
 ''We take the application essay incredibly seriously,'' he says. ''This is how we begin to understand who the person is outside the traditional measures of academic success, and why they would make a choice to come back to a place like Columbia, when there are places where you could go finish your degree probably in a much faster and easier manner.''
 But even in the toughest admissions quest, continuing education programs want to fill seats. They employ advisers who work intensively with borderline applicants to help them get up to speed and get in -- even if that means, as it did for Mr. Thorsen, taking prep courses at other programs. They sometimes admit students provisionally, contingent on the grades they earn. 
 THE admissions door widens considerably when adults are taught in separate classrooms. To be admitted to the undergraduate degree program at the Harvard Extension School, applicants must write a ''satisfactory essay'' and first complete three Extension School courses, including writing and critical reading, with grades of B- or higher. Students can take only four courses at Harvard College, though some Extension School classes, including those held online, are taught by faculty members who also have teaching appointments at Harvard University. Students graduate with a Bachelor of Liberal Arts in extension studies.
 To gain provisional admission to the weekend and evening baccalaureate program at Northwestern University, adult applicants who never attended college submit a writing sample, take a composition course and must achieve a B average or better in their first four courses. Free tutoring is available to students who struggle to write papers.
 Writing, too, is the critical component for Georgetown's evening Liberal Studies Degree Program, designed for part-time students. Applicants need only a C average in previous work, but they must also write a short essay on what they've been doing since attending school and a five-page analysis of a book they've recently read, whether it's history, a novel or even religious guidance. 
 ''We know that if they can't write this kind of essay, they can't make it,'' says Phyllis O'Callaghan, associate dean and director of the program. Ms. O'Callaghan tells authors of subpar essays to ''go and take some noncredit courses in writing, in sentence structure, in grammar and organization and come back and reapply in a year.''
 IT can be humbling for successful adults to face selective admissions officers. Ross Cockrell, 25, was one of those applicants with a puzzle-piece collection of academic gaps and professional achievements. Bearing a high school diploma earned with a proficiency test, his 10-year-old PSAT scores (standardized test scores not required) and an impressive business profile that included a foray into venture capitalism, Mr. Cockrell was summoned cross-country to an interview for the University of Pennsylvania's College of General Studies.
 In the most recent round, the college admitted about half of 151 applicants. It offers separate evening and weekend classes (not all taught by Penn faculty) for adult baccalaureate candidates, but also encourages crossover with the traditional liberal arts program. Many adults join the younger day students to complete their majors, and traditional-age undergraduates can enroll in continuing education night courses.
 Mr. Cockrell was admitted with a provisional caveat: he had to earn a grade point average of 2.7 or above in his first four courses. ''I didn't have four years of English and math, and they were concerned about that,'' says Mr. Cockrell, an economics major. He admits that he, too, ''was a little leery'' about the math. 
 Following his adviser's counsel, Mr. Cockrell eased into college, taking two courses in each of his first two semesters. He earned a 3.9 G.P.A. in his first three terms, and now has his sights on a dual business/law graduate degree.

HEADLINE: It's Payback Time

BYLINE: By Jonathan D. Glater

 BODY:
STUDENT loans are two-edged: the more money a student can borrow, the more schooling falls within reach. But of course, the more debt a student has, the more painful repayment becomes. 
 Sometimes graduates find repayment impossible. And with the amount of student debt rising -- along with interest rates about to go up on the most popular government loans -- some student advocates are worried.
''More students will be required to take out more money from the federal government and from private'' lenders, says Jasmine L. Harris, legislative director at the United States Student Association, a student advocacy group in Washington. Over time, she continues, ''It's a great formula for unmanageable levels of debt and hence higher default rates.'' 
 Overall default rates, monitored by the Education Department, have fallen over the past 15 years, and in 2003, the most recent year for which data is available, the rate of 4.5 percent -- representing 115,568 borrowers -- was the lowest ever. 
 Theresa S. Shaw, chief operating officer of the department's Office of Federal Student Aid, attributes the decline to more thorough education of students about the consequences of borrowing. Interest rates have also been historically low, making repayment easier. 
 But the average loan debt carried by graduates has been climbing -- from about $13,300 in 1992-93 to $18,900 in 2003-04, according to calculations, in 2003 dollars, by the College Board. The percentage of students taking out loans has also risen, from 49 percent in the 1992-93 school year to 66 percent in 2003-04.
 The consequences of defaulting, too, are worse than they have been in years past. 
 A provision of a law that took effect last year, for example, makes it next to impossible to discharge private student loans in personal bankruptcy proceedings (federal loans were already barred). Up to 15 percent of defaulting borrowers' wages can be garnished, and under a decision made by the United States Supreme Court in December, Social Security payments are vulnerable. Tax refunds are also often intercepted to repay student loan debts, the Education Department says. 
 ''The penalties are severe,'' says Ms. Harris, adding that the measures are more often imposed on poor borrowers, who by definition have a harder time managing debt burden. ''Obviously, the wealthiest in our society are not the ones defaulting on their loans.''
 Critics of the current loan system contend that the default rate is actually higher than the Education Department reports. They point to a study issued in December 2003 by the department's inspector general that found that the downward trend has been affected by a change in the definition of default. Before 1998, default was defined as failure to make a payment for 180 days; after 1998, a default began after nonpayment for 270 days. The change has reduced the rates, the report states -- in 1999, for one, by about half a percentage point. 
 The good news is, under the current rules, a student is not considered in default on a federal loan -- the kind that most students turn to first -- unless no payment is made for nine months. And repayment schedules can often be modified to make them more manageable. 
 For example, the repayment term for some federal student loans, like the Stafford and PLUS parental loan programs, can be extended to as long as 30 years. It is also possible to arrange to make gradually larger loan payments over time, so that debt costs -- ideally -- increase along with a borrower's income. 
 One way to ward off default is to apply for a deferral. A lender must grant one to eligible borrowers with federal loans who can't find a job or encounter other economic hardship, or who enroll at least half time at a postsecondary institution or in a graduate fellowship program. For those with subsidized Stafford loans, the government pays all interest during deferment; not so for unsubsidized Staffords: interest will continue to accrue.
 A borrower who doesn't meet criteria for a deferral can try for a forbearance, which also postpones or reduces payments. Its formula for determining hardship is more generous than for a deferral. While hardship deferrals are limited to a total of three years over the life of a loan, forbearances are considered short-term help and typically last a year (though there's no limit to how many can be granted). Borrowers are responsible for paying the interest, no matter the kind of loan. 
 Also, lenders are not obligated to grant a forbearance except in a few circumstances, like natural disasters or military mobilization. Nonetheless, forbearances have become routine because, from just about every point of view, delayed payment beats default. 
 And that's the bottom line: Ms. Shaw of the Education Department advises that a struggling borrower should try to make a payment of any kind, however small, to avoid default.

HEADLINE: Tug of War Played With Cable

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
LIKE many cable customers, William Donohue of Massapequa Park felt trapped. For years, he thought Cablevision charged too much for a bunch of channels he rarely watched. But he avoided subscribing to a satellite-television service because the trees in his backyard might occasionally block reception.
 So when Verizon unveiled a competing cable television service in Massapequa Park in January, Mr. Donohue jumped at the chance to switch. Now he pays a few dollars less a month for about the same number of channels. And by ordering his telephone, broadband line and cellphone service from Verizon as well, he saves about $60 a month compared with buying each from different providers.
''I'm sure there are a lot of people in my position, who are paying Cablevision because they don't have any choice,'' said Mr. Donohue, a municipal bond trader who says he even gets better reception from Verizon than from Cablevision. ''But thank God for choice.''
 Mr. Donohue's decision to swap providers is about more than how Long Islanders get their television fix and what they pay for it. He is one of a growing number of Long Islanders caught in the increasingly nasty fight between Cablevision and Verizon, two local giants that have dominated their original turf for years and are now trying to fend each other off. 
 Cablevision has grabbed hundreds of thousands of Verizon's telephone customers since 2003, when it introduced its Optimum Voice phone service to accompany its Optimum Online broadband Internet service. Verizon has countered with a television product that it hopes will win back old customers and then some.
 ''Cablevision has successfully destroyed the value of Verizon's phone customers,'' said Jeffrey Halpern, a telecommunications analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. ''If you're Verizon, you might as well strike at Cablevision's heart.''
 Though Verizon has also started selling video services in communities in Texas, Virginia and elsewhere, the stakes on Long Island are particularly high. As Verizon well knows, Cablevision's customers are some of the country's most affluent and best-educated consumers. Unlike Comcast and Time Warner Cable, whose customers are scattered across the country, all of Cablevision's subscribers are clustered in and around New York.
 With so much on the line, the companies have been playing hardball, criticizing each other and the supporters they have drafted to back them, both in Washington and Albany and in the towns and villages, like Massapequa Park, that grant cable franchises.
 Cablevision has accused Verizon of redlining -- offering service to wealthier (and by implication, white) residential areas while neglecting districts where poorer (and presumably nonwhite) people live. And it says Verizon has tried to sidestep legal rules for acquiring cable franchises. Verizon denies both accusations and said that, in fact, the next few communities on the Island where it will roll out the service have large nonwhite populations. 
 For its part, Verizon says Cablevision is bent on blocking competition in video service, even though it has entered the phone market with little trouble. Cablevision says in response that all it wants is for Verizon to play by the same rules it must obey.
 Taking on Cablevision will not be easy. The company, based in Bethpage, is regarded as one of the best run in the cable television industry. Cablevision has more phone, broadband and digital-television customers, as a share of all customers, than any other cable company. And it has extensive investments in its own content: it owns movie networks like IFC and AMC, as well as the Rangers and the Knicks (although the Dolan family, which founded Cablevision, has been pilloried for the Knicks' dismal record this season).
 ''For years, Cablevision has been way ahead of the curve in terms of technology and getting and retaining customers,'' said Robert Routh, a cable industry analyst at Jefferies & Company who owns Cablevision stock but does no banking business with the company. ''Why would you go against them in their area? You'll spend a fortune on marketing and infrastructure.''
 Still, if Verizon can steal a significant number of Cablevision customers, it will stand a better chance in other, softer markets around the country, analysts say. 
 How is it doing so far? The mayor of Massapequa Park, James Altadonna Jr., said that through March, Verizon had signed up 225 customers in the village. A Verizon spokesman, John Bonomo, said the number of subscribers is now much higher but he declined to be more specific.
 Cablevision, by contrast, had 4,723 residential subscribers in the village at the end of 2005, according to the mayor's office. 
 Whatever the numbers, the showdown on Long island has turned into a test of whether Verizon and the other Bell phone companies -- who have tried and failed to sell television before -- can finally crack the market.
 Many consumers and politicians, including Mr. Altadonna, hope both companies succeed, because prices often fall when competition grows.
 ''We were all frustrated just having one player in town,'' he said. ''We're very happy with competition.''
 Mr. Altadonna said the entry of a new player has already helped bring cable prices down somewhat in Massapequa Park, following the pattern seen in the area of Texas where Verizon also competes against cable and satellite television. According to the American Consumer Institute, an independent research group, customers there have been able to cut their bills by more than 22 percent by switching providers.
 The prospect of lower prices was what motivated the Town of Hempstead to approve Verizon's application to sell the service in the town's unincorporated areas, with about 500,000 of the town's 760,000 residents.
 ''It's an article of faith that if you have more competition, you get better service and prices,'' said Kate Murray, the Hempstead supervisor. ''Cablevision feels they have a lot at stake, because they've been the only game in town for 40 years. But this wasn't a judgment about Cablevision, it was a judgment about monopolies.''
 Verizon said the first four parts of Hempstead to be offered the service will be Elmont, Lakeview, Roosevelt and North Baldwin. By the end of 2007, the company said, the fiber optic cables needed to carry the television service will be installed in about 85 percent of the town. 
 Verizon still must negotiate agreements separately with 13 of the town's 21 incorporated villages, including the largest, the Village of Hempstead. And it is expected to apply for franchises in other towns on the Island before long.
 Still, lower bills aren't the only issue on consumers' minds. In a survey by the consumer institute, residents in the area around Dallas where Verizon offers video service said that getting better service and better channel packages were more important than a lower price. 
 That could suggest that the cable service there was particularly weak. Or it could show that Verizon can compete effectively without starting a price war, just by offering new products, according to Steve Pociask, the institute's chief economist. Either way, Verizon will have to attract more than novelty-seekers if it hopes to pay off the substantial cost of building its new network -- now running about $2,000 a home, according to Wall Street analysts who follow the company.
 That price tag worries the analysts, who reckon that Verizon will have to spend nearly $18 billion by the end of the decade to get video services to about 16 million homes, or roughly 60 percent of its phone customers. Verizon also must pay far more per subscriber than Cablevision does for programming now, because it has fewer subscribers.
 But Verizon is not trying to win every last customer where it is building its fiber network. Rather, it wants to focus on subscribers who are willing to buy all its services.
 ''We want a strategy that if we win the customer, cable is not in the house anymore,'' said Ivan Seidenberg, Verizon's chief executive.
 For the most part, Verizon's first few video customers appear reasonably happy. Mr. Donohue, who gets a basic package of 180 channels for $39.99 a month and an additional sports tier for $5.95, says the big draw for him is the clearer picture. 
 ''My TV upstairs never had a good signal, but now it's like a brand-new TV,'' he said. ''I thought I was just getting cable, but it's been so much better.''
 A Verizon spokesman said its service may offer a slightly better picture on some channels than cable companies can, because it is able to obtain those signals directly through its fiber optic network, rather than use an antenna or satellite dish. Cablevision did not respond to requests for comment about reception quality.
 Other Verizon customers, including John Fischofer, another Massapequa Park resident who often works from home, said Verizon's Internet connections ''totally blew away the speeds that Optimum Online was offering.''
 Verizon sells three different speeds of Internet service, including a 30-megabit-per-second line that is one of the fastest available for homes.
 There are some disadvantages, though. Verizon's television package does not include the YES Network, which carries the Yankees and the Nets, nor does it carry MSG, the Cablevision-owned channel that covers the Knicks and the Rangers, or News 12, Cablevision's local news channel. 
 Installation can also take several weeks to arrange, and some of the equipment must be mounted outside the house. Cablevision also says that Verizon tacks on hidden fees and taxes that bring its total charges closer to the cable company's once they are factored in. 
 There is ''an element of sticker shock when people get a package of services from Verizon,'' said Pat Gottesman, a vice president for product management and marketing at Cablevision. She said some customers who switched to Verizon have switched back again. 
 Stanley Jacobs made that U-turn. A retired engineer, Mr. Jacobs signed up for Verizon's 30-day trial after a Verizon salesman came to his door. Initially, he was happy with his Internet connection, which he said was faster. But he had trouble using the remote that controlled the set-top box and the television.
 ''After a while, you get to learn what the deal is, but it's very frustrating,'' he said, adding that he had to press three buttons each time to get the television to work. On top of that, he said, he missed the local weather reports on Cablevision's news channels.
 When he switched back to Cablevision, the company gave him a digital video recorder free for a year (the usual charge is $9.95 a month). Mr. Jacobs said he is also saving about $20 a month on Cablevision's flat-fee phone service, compared with Verizon's rate. 
 ''When you go someplace else and they try to get you back, they drop the price,'' Mr. Jacobs said.
 Verizon is only just starting to battle Cablevision, not to mention satellite providers like DirecTV and Dish Network. Yet the field may get even more crowded. In February, the Long Island Power Authority said it would begin testing technology that would let it provide high-speed Internet connections through electrical lines. 
 In the second half of the year, LIPA will begin testing the service in 105 homes and businesses in Commack and Hauppauge. Though it is still a few years away from being offered commercially on Long Island, the technology, known as broadband over power line, or B.P.L., could ultimately provide telephone and video services over those connections as well.
 For now, Long Islanders in select areas can take comfort in knowing they now have more choices for buying their television service.
 ''Verizon will have some success,'' said Mr. Pociask of the consumer institute. ''But in the very end it doesn't matter how successful they are, because the real winner here will be consumers.''

HEADLINE: That Was Easy: Social Security Problem Solved

BYLINE: By JANE GORDON

 BODY:
A NUMBER of presidents and untold members of Congress have been unable to figure out how to fix the Social Security system. But they could have called on four students from Staples High School in Westport to do it for them, in less than 14 hours. 
 That is how long the students were given to collect information, build a mathematical model, write a computer program and calculate the most effective solution to the Social Security problem, no politics involved. The four, all top math performers at Staples, were competing in the Moody's Mega Math Challenge, sponsored by the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, a math advocacy group, and the Moody's Foundation, part of the Moody's Corporation that owns Moody's Investor Service.
One member of the Staples team, Elizabeth Marshman, 17, who will be attending Yale in the fall and is considering majoring in biomedical engineering, comes from a family of English majors, she said. ''They don't know what to do with me,'' Ms. Marshman said. ''They were sort of surprised when I said I had to be at school at 7 on a Saturday morning, but they went with it. They didn't realize the magnitude of it.'' 
 Her family soon realized how important the project was, especially on the day Ms. Marshman came home and told them she had just won $5,000 in scholarship money.
 ''My mom said, 'I can't believe they gave you a problem the government can't even solve,'' said Ms. Marshman, the only girl on the contest team.
 The challenge team beat 128 high schools in New York, New Jersey and Fairfield County. ''Some of them have 500 students on their math teams,'' said Michelle Montgomery, the contest coordinator. 
 Teams from the Bronx High School of Science, Brooklyn Technical High School and Stuyvesant High School, all renowned for high-performing math programs, lost to Staples, whose math-team membership of 12 to 15 seesaws from month to month. Three math team members, Vikas Murali, 17; Andrew Tschirhart, 18; and Ms. Marshman, competed on the Staples Mega Math Challenge Team, along with Miles Lubin, 16, a junior who has been tinkering with computer programs since he was 4 years old. 
 Math is not typically known for its cliffhanger moments. But the team, which came to school on Saturday, March 4 to work on a solution, offered a few. The students first researched Social Security, which though solvent, is threatened by a number of factors including increasing life spans and a continuing increase in the percentage of retirees in the population. 
 In 1950, there were 16.5 workers paying into Social Security for every retiree receiving benefits, according to a study done in April 2005 by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. By 2030, the bank estimated, 2.17 workers will pay for every one retiree. By 2044, the Social Security trust fund will be emptied, according to estimates from the Social Security and Medicare boards of trustees. 
 Team members calculated expected revenue, then expenditures, then devised mathematical functions that would model income and population changes over time, economic growth and other factors. ''By lunchtime we had an idea of where we were going,'' Mr. Lubin said. ''But we didn't have anything concrete yet.'' 
 They debated whether to consider privatization, but decided the subject was too time-consuming and politically sensitive. Mr. Lubin wrote a computer program to process the data they had collected. The program began producing numbers by dinnertime. 
 Moments before the 9 p.m. deadline, the school's computer filter censored a word that Mr. Tschirhart had used as an inside joke in the title of his contribution to the final paper. He tried twice, unsuccessfully, to send his information to Ms. Marshman, who was compiling work from each student for the final entry. With the deadline nearing, the students told Mr. Tschirhart that appending the information to the e-mail might work. It did (because, the students did not realize, it removed the offensive title). Ms. Marshman included it, and with nine seconds left, hit send. Social Security, with all its troubles, was solved.
 Their final answer was actually two: The system could remain solvent well past 2080 if retirees became eligible for Social Security at age 70 or if the Social Security tax rate could be raised to 18 percent, from 15.3 percent, to continue financing the system. 
 ''We had talked about how we were supposed to be presenting this to Congress,'' Mr. Tschirhart said. ''So we tried to do a range of solutions.''
 Students involved in the challenge may never see any money from Social Security if Congress doesn't adopt their idea, but they certainly saw the potential for a cash bonus if they won the contest. 
 Moody's offered up $60,000 in prizes, including a $20,000 scholarship to the winners. The money surely figured in the school's entry into the contest, said Bill Walsh, a mathematics teacher who brought the students pizza for dinner, but was otherwise not permitted to be in the room, per contest rules. He tried to keep track of their progress by periodically peeking through a school window. 
 ''To be really honest, the $20,000 really caught our attention,'' Mr. Walsh said. ''We have many opportunities to compete in a lot of things, but $20,000 does catch your eye.''
 Moody's, as an internationally known source for financial research, risk analysis and credit ratings, is no stranger to the power of cash. The company's foundation put up the scholarship money, and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics organized the competition.
 ''To be part of a situation where you're able to reward kids, recognize kids, attach status and prestige and give them money for being smart -- smart in math -- that's a great thing,'' said Michelle Montgomery, a spokeswoman for the society, which has its headquarters in Philadelphia. ''We went back and forth on the money thing, and settled on those numbers as decent numbers, enough to get people interested, not so much that it would overshadow the integrity of the competition.''
 The judging was initially blind, until the judges -- all applied mathematicians with doctorates in their fields -- picked the top six papers. They then heard the six team presentations on April 5 at the Moody's offices on Church Street in lower Manhattan, to determine the order of winners. One hour after the presentations were done, the winners were announced in much the same way contestants on ''American Idol'' are booted off. The lowest vote getter was announced first, then the next, then the next, until two Mega Math Challenge Teams were left, one from Immaculata High School in Somerville, N.J., and Staples. 
 Immaculata's name was announced, and the Staples cheering section of teachers, parents and students yelled with joy.
 Not that the winners are politically naive. ''The thing is, making a solution and modeling is one thing,'' said Mr. Murali, a senior on the team. ''Implementing it is a totally different, politically sensitive issue.''

HEADLINE: When the Best Is Not Good Enough

BYLINE: By Paula Marantz Cohen. 
Paula Marantz Cohen teaches English at Drexel University. Her latest novel is ''Jane Austen in Scarsdale or Love, Death and the SAT's'' (St. Martin's).

 BODY:
AS April draws to a close, parents of college-bound children can finally relax. The verdicts are in. No more lying awake worrying that the A.P. biology teacher can't write a decent reference letter, or carrying around a pocket calculator to recheck G.P.A., or clogging supermarket aisles to compare rankings in U.S. News & World Report. 
 Having been caught in the insanity with my first child (and wanting to avoid it with my second) I decided to stand back and ask: Why do so many intelligent, rational people turn into basket cases when their children start the application process? Parents have always wanted the best for their children, but in the last decade this desire has taken an unusually obsessive form.
For the next crop of parents, before they succumb, here is my own sociological analysis of what's going on.

THE NEED TO DO BETTER
 
 Only a few generations ago, going to college was a significant achievement. But once higher education became widely available, it ceased to carry the same weight. More seemed called for: successful parents who received excellent educations at city and state universities now want their children to attend private universities, and those who thrived at good if not stellar private universities want their children to go to more elite ones. As for parents who attended Ivy League schools, they want their children to go there, too, but to work harder, make better connections and double major in economics and Chinese. 
 The drive to improve, to do things better and bigger, is inherently American. Yet there comes a time when there's less room for improvement, and we must find artificial goals -- a wider TV screen, a bigger S.U.V. -- to produce an illusion of progress. This seems to be the case with college. It used to be that getting an education was the goal; now, it is getting a brand-name education. This is a shift from content to form, from the thing itself to the way it is packaged. 

THE NARCISSISM OF MINOR DIFFERENCES
 Freud coined this phrase to refer to the phenomenon that similar countries or peoples, living in proximity to one another, develop rivalries and antagonisms. This makes the individual communities more cohesive, and allows each to assert its prominence. The same holds for colleges. Elite institutions of a certain size and locale tend to resemble one another and yet to fight fiercely to maintain a sense of superiority, which is to say, a higher U.S. News ranking. 
 Universities use rankings as a lure, making it seem that admission to a college ranked higher than another is crucial, only to turn around and blithely use the club of selectivity to beat away the hordes that, as a result, want desperately to gain entry. 
 A student is likely to experience great disappointment when rejected from, say, Amherst, despite being admitted to, say, Colby. But since these colleges are seemingly very similar, enormous time and energy are required to distinguish one from the other. Monet painted many pictures of Rouen Cathedral, which art historians have spent their careers studying. Likewise, parents pore over the catalogs of Dartmouth, Williams, Middlebury, Bowdoin, et al. As with all connoisseurship in which extremely small, elusive qualities are subject to analysis, the results are bound to be uncertain and contradictory, leading parents to an even deeper analysis of small New England liberal arts colleges.
 The admissions process is not unlike the kabbalah or ''Finnegans Wake'': one works hard at coming to an understanding under the assumption that one never will. Urban (or rather suburban) legends abound: how the student with perfect scores -- a third-generation legacy whose grandfather has a building named after him -- was deferred from Yale. Parents are told ''it's a crapshoot'' so many times they may be tempted to join Gamblers Anonymous. 

CONSPICUOUS ACHIEVEMENT
 As the price of tuition began to rise in the 1980's, it looked as if the middle class would make a beeline for state universities. But the predicted backlash never happened. Instead, paying a high price for college became an example of what the sociologist Thorstein Veblen, in 1899, called conspicuous consumption -- money spent as a sign of social status.
 But attending certain colleges these days is not just conspicuous consumption; it is also conspicuous achievement -- accomplishments displayed as a sign of social status. And children are the favored vehicles. If Johnny is proficient in American sign language, contract bridge and ice dancing, Janie must play the harp, collect prom dresses for the needy and be a member of the Olympic equestrian team. To fail at landing a seat in an elite college is to fall behind in the race that began with potty training.

ARTISTIC ANGST
 The child-centered culture that has emerged the last several decades can be understood as an outgrowth of the creative self-expression of the 1960's. Parents came to see themselves as artists, and their children as canvases or lumps of clay. The problem, of course, is that children are not made of canvas or clay and are likely to resist being filled in or pummeled into shape. 
 In light of this resistance, the obsessive focus on college can be understood as a form of artistic desperation, a last-ditch effort to validate parental creativity: ''Well, maybe Jenny isn't exactly what I had in mind, but at least she got into Duke.'' A great college can also be enlisted to finish the work begun by parents. The credit here might read: ''Jenny Jones by Jeff and Amanda Jones, with assistance from Duke University.'' 

APOCALYPTIC ANGST
 Artistic angst reflects the fear of parents that they may not have shaped their progeny into the best or most finished form. Apocalyptic angst is the larger fear that the world will hamper their children in unforeseen ways. 
 This anxiety has always been around, but it greatly increased during the Vietnam era when it became clear that money and heavy artillery were not enough to protect our children. The uncertainty and vulnerability that are that legacy have only increased with the threat of terrorism. Thus, the college decal on the car is just a talisman against harm. 
 The parents who are most anxious over admissions tend to be highly educated. This is not surprising. They know a good education can pave the way for success. But what constitutes a good education? No doubt an elite college will provide one, but will it provide a better one? Isn't the notion of a good education as varied as the temperaments and interests of our children? 
 And what of success? For some, success means working in a Manhattan law firm with all its financial and social perks; for others it's teaching in a public school with summers free to travel and explore hobbies. Perhaps our children can ''do better'' when they send their own children to college -- with a balanced, philosophical and individualized perspective on the meaning of success.

HEADLINE: Trained in Manhattan, Graduating to the World

BYLINE: By ALISON GREGOR

 BODY:
TO swim to the top ranks of commercial real estate brokers in New York City, Barry M. Gosin perfected an elegant crawl. But now, as the chief executive of Newmark Knight Frank, he has to maneuver the waters of a much larger pond. 
 Mr. Gosin's company -- formerly known as Newmark & Company, which expanded nationally only about five years ago -- sealed a partnership in January with Knight Frank of London, one of the world's largest privately owned property consulting firms. Last year, the firms handled transactions that, combined, were valued at more than $41 billion, with annual revenue of more than $545 million.
Mr. Gosin will oversee the operations in North and South America, while Knight Frank's chairman and senior partner, Nick Thomlinson, will oversee the rest of the offices throughout the world. 
 Besides supervising Newmark's 26 offices in the United States, Mr. Gosin will have under his auspices five existing Knight Frank offices in Brazil and three that will open later this year in Lima, Peru; Santiago, Chile; and Buenos Aires. Mr. Gosin, 55, who grew up in East Flatbush, Brooklyn, seems eager to take on the global arena. ''Someone told me a long time ago, if you don't grow, you die,'' he said. ''Every business has to be dynamic.'' 
 Mr. Gosin and a business partner, Jeffrey Gural, bought Newmark in 1978 from Mr. Gural's father, Aaron Gural, who had taken over the company from Dave Newmark, its founder. At the time, Mr. Gosin was a fledgling real estate entrepreneur who had joined the firm to learn how to buy real estate.
 And that he did. Mr. Gosin and several Newmark principals have an eight-million-square-foot commercial real estate portfolio that includes the landmark Flatiron Building in Manhattan.
 ''Aaron Gural came out of the Helmsley-Spear school of real estate,'' Mr. Gosin said, referring to the real estate company. ''He taught us how to buy property, and it was a great platform for us.''
 Newmark also expanded into development, forming a construction division several years ago that specialized in converting office buildings into apartments. Until recently, Mr. Gosin and his partners, along with the developer David Walentas, owned about 10 buildings in the Dumbo area of Brooklyn, and worked to transform Dumbo from an obscure industrial area into a trendy residential neighborhood.
 Mr. Gosin, a history buff, is enthusiastic about a purchase in 2004: for about $4 million his company acquired the former headquarters of Bethlehem Steel in Bethlehem, Pa., and the surrounding 125 acres. The deal includes the headquarters building, designed by Sanford White, and three million square feet of structures. Mr. Gosin and his partners envision a development worth more than $400 million that is to include a casino with 5,000 slot machines -- state license permitting -- a hotel, theater, retail stores, residential buildings and a museum commemorating the country's industrial history.
 ''The steel for most of the large buildings in New York City was forged here,'' he said. ''This is where the 20th century was built.'' 
 But the allure of ownership aside, Mr. Gosin's first love is brokering deals. As he points out, Harry Helmsley, the legendary New York City real estate magnate, also worked as a broker until the day he died in 1997. 
 ''It's an exciting business, and a great way of being a part of what happens in the city,'' said Mr. Gosin, who began cultivating Newmark's brokerage and advisory division when he sensed a lull in the city's real estate market in the late 80's.
 ''I saw a disconnect between the fundamentals and the values, so the underlying demand was not there,'' Mr. Gosin said. ''The prices were continuing to go up in the late 80's. Rents didn't go up. It just didn't appear to be right, so we needed to find an alternative to keep us busy.''
 During Mr. Gosin's tenure, Newmark's brokerage business has flourished.
 ''We have a unique perspective on the advisory business in that we're one of the few brokerage firms that has a significant investment portfolio,'' Mr. Gosin said. ''And we think that the fact that we own property and the fact that we run property gives us a unique vantage point from which to represent companies who rent space and properties.''
 Mr. Gosin represents mostly big tenants and has handled some of New York City's largest and most intricate leasing deals, including the consolidation of the new Manhattan headquarters of Bloomberg L.P. at 731 Lexington Avenue, between 58th and 59th Streets, in the One Beacon Court building. (Construction on the Bloomberg Tower was completed last year.) 
 Mr. Gosin said his team first had to sell the move to Michael R. Bloomberg, the company founder, who was not yet mayor of New York. ''My first conversation with Mike went like, 'You're on so many floors, you're in so many buildings, it would be a good opportunity for you when your lease expires to consolidate,' '' Mr. Gosin said. ''And Mike is fairly glib. He said, 'If you can prove that it makes economic sense, go talk to my head of real estate, and we'll do it.' ''
 ''The exchange probably lasted 15 minutes, because that's about as long as, I guess, Mike would give somebody for the first time,'' he said.
 Mr. Gosin said Newmark then had to persuade the principals at Vornado Realty Trust, the developer, to let Bloomberg lease a portion of One Beacon Court tower, which had not yet been built. It had been largely slated for residential use.
 ''We went to Steve Roth and suggested that we be the anchor tenant in the base of the building,'' Mr. Gosin said, referring to the chief executive of Vornado. ''At the time, they had a preference for more residential, and had they known the market would have shot up the way it did, they probably would have done even more residential.''
 Still, the Newmark team pulled off the deal, leasing 700,000 square feet in a building that didn't yet exist, and ensuring that its client, as an anchor tenant, would be able to design the building according to its needs.
 ''We spent 18 months torturously negotiating a lease for Bloomberg so they'd build a new building'' for the company, Mr. Gosin said. ''The building, which is beautiful, is designed with Bloomberg specs.''
 Mr. Gosin said jokingly that he should have been paid by the hour on that transaction. But Jeffrey Gural, the chairman of Newmark Knight Frank, said, ''As a broker, Barry's real strength is he really and truly tries to do a good job for his client -- even if it means not making a commission.'' 
 Mark Weiss, an executive vice president at Newmark who joined from a competing brokerage firm, Studley, almost four years ago, described Mr. Gosin as a caring boss. Shortly after arriving at Newmark, Mr. Weiss said, he discovered that his wife had breast cancer. 
 Mr. Gosin ''walked into my office, put his arm around me -- and I didn't really know this guy, it was a new relationship -- said, 'Anything you need, we're here for you,' '' Mr. Weiss said. ''He had promised a pretty big bill of goods, and he has delivered on all fronts.''
 BUT does Mr. Gosin also have that toughness to lead a company on a large and impersonal global front, against giant competitors like CB Richard Ellis, Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle? 
 Perhaps a clue lies in his tennis game. 
 When osteoarthritis was diagnosed in his left shoulder several years ago, Mr. Gosin, a southpaw, learned to serve ''righty'' and continued todominate his competitors.
 Mr. Gosin will need to be just as adaptable to succeed in the global commercial real estate market. 
 ''Barry's as good as they come,'' said Robert J. Alexander, chairman of the New York regional practice at CB Richard Ellis. ''But I think his company's got a lot of challenges ahead, and the results will speak for themselves over the next few years. Clearly, this is no slam-dunk.''

Consider your reaction if I whispered to you, ''The Fed is likely to raise interest rates by 25 basis points!'' Scary, no? But what if I said, ''Looks as if Ben Bernanke and the boys are going for another quarter-percent rise in rates.'' You would yawn; been there, done that.
Why, then, is the expression of a fraction in words less alarming than the same amount expressed in numerals? Answer: ''25'' sounds much bigger than ''one-quarter.'' Basis points are fine gradations of interest measurements of interest to financial insiders, but mysterious -- and therefore vaguely troubling -- to ''the little guy.'' Politicians have talking points, public opinion has tipping points and outraged spouses have boiling points, but only bankers lay claim to basis points. 
 This is prelude to today's assignment: deciphering the language of the Federal Reserve System, otherwise known as the House of Hints. 
 Everybody in a bank elevator shuts up when somebody whispers inverted yield curve. It has nothing to do with the Kamasutra; rather, it is the curious development that Alan Greenspan, the former Fed chairman, found to be a conundrum, or puzzlement: why are long-term interest rates not rising as they usually do when the Fed raises short-term interest rates? The yields on bonds -- the interest rate you get -- usually curve up or down together. But these days, while the rates on short-term bonds are riding the up escalator, 30-year mortgage rates are on the down escalator (admittedly a contradiction in terms), propping up the housing market. At any rate, our yield curve is inverted -- reversed, turned upside down. 
 What does an I.Y.C. foretell? A year ago, in Greenspanspeak, we heard, ''History suggests that that is usually or has been a forward indicator for softening economic activity'' -- that is, a slump could be in store -- but Greenspan added cautiously that times had changed. Bearded Ben Bernanke, his successor as Fed chairman, was more outspoken recently: ''The inverted yield curve is not signaling a slowdown.'' 

Global Glutmanship
 Here's the reason not to worry about the I.Y.C., given by Ben Bernanke one year ago, well before he became the world's most powerful central banker: ''the global saving glut.'' (I knew Helicopter Ben would go far; he construes saving as singular, not as the sloppy ''savings.'' His inspired choice of glut is from the Latin gluttire, ''to eat greedily,'' source of glutton.) 
 For a description of this glutmanship, I turn to Rich Miller of Bloomberg News: ''It's an argument that there is a glut of saving in the world, particularly in fast-growing countries in Asia, where people are saving a lot of money and not investing in their economies. The same is true for the aging population of Europe. So we don't need to be as concerned about our budget deficit because there's all this money out there that can be invested in American companies.''
 How can you tell when the Fed is worried about inflation? When it is not, it harps on ongoing productivity gains; when it is, the governors issue a statement about possible increases in resource utilization, which means that more jobs (which is good) could lead to a rise in the cost of living (not so good). When they use both code phrases in the same statement, it means that they are conflicted. 
 The word accommodative, closely watched for its appearance or disappearance, means ''low interest rates that boost the economy.'' Usual market reaction when Fedspeakers say they are pursuing ''an accommodative policy'': whee! 
 What word do they use when the policy is to slow down growth to avoid inflation? The word that economists prefer is restrictive, but that word is anathema in the Temple of C Street. Restrictive not only has overtones of Nimby -- the acronym for ''not in my backyard'' -- but also conjures an image of putting the robust American economy into a straitjacket. Therefore, to hint at future restriction, the chosen euphemism has been policy accommodation can be removed, which Gregory Ip, senior special writer at The Wall Street Journal, says ''sounds like they are removing the sofa beds from the Fed's executive lounge.''
 How soon the squeeze? ''At a pace that is likely to be measured.'' Translation: ''one of these quarters, somebody (who, us?) could start restricting, but a little at a time; you won't even feel it.'' Use of the adjective measured is prudence in action; it follows the policy of King Mithridates, who foiled assassins by taking a little poison at a time and ''died old''; it means ''nothing drastic; figure a quarter of 1 percent, or 25 basis points, pardon the expression.''

Policy Firming
 We will never hear the words ''tight money'' pass our central bankers' lips. (At the Fed, the adjective tight is used only in its informal sense of ''drunk.'') Instead of spooking Wall Street with the dread phrase monetary tightening, statement writers at our central bank a few months ago noted that ''some further policy firming might be needed.'' Not tightening the money; only firming the policy.
 ''Why speak in code?'' asks Greg Ip, the master code breaker of financial jargon. ''I no longer have to think hard to translate policy accommodation into 'low interest rates' or increases in resource utilization into 'lower unemployment and factories operating close to capacity.' The reason is that the Fed prizes flexibility. If it were too explicit in describing what it planned to do, it would be harder to do something different in the event the economy behaved unexpectedly.. . .Thus even as it communicates more, it prefers to do so in Fedspeak.''
 Updates will be data dependent, meaning ''let's see what develops.''

HEADLINE: China Wins Over Washington, But D.C. Proves a Bit Tougher 

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER; Joseph Kahn contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
IF President Hu Jintao thought all Americans held the same opinion of China, the notion was surely dispelled last week during his visits to the nation's two Washingtons. 
 In Washington the state, Mr. Hu beamed as he hobnobbed with the capitalist kings of computers, coffee shops and airplanes, who are among those making a mint in China's markets.
 In Washington the city, Mr. Hu got a rather frostier reception. A dissident heckler startled him on the White House lawn, a White House announcer called his country the Republic of China -- did someone say Taiwan? -- and a senator warned that China should open more of its markets to American products, or else. 
 The chill in the East and the warmth in the West were, of course, mostly about money. The number most policymakers in Washington, D.C., think about when they think about China is the $202 billion trade deficit in 2005, up 25 percent from the year before. In Seattle, the focus is on the $5 billion that businesses in the state exported to China last year, up 64 percent from 2004. 
 ''I flew into Beijing on a Boeing jet, in the taxi to my hotel I saw a sign for Microsoft on top of a building, and when I got there, there was a Starbucks across the street,'' Christine Gregoire, the governor of Washington, said. ''Not many governors can say that.''
 The East Coast also made more of China's human rights record than the West Coast did. At the mansion of the Microsoft chairman Bill Gates in the Seattle suburbs on Tuesday night, Mr. Hu managed to get through dinner without once being pressed on the Chinese government's censorship of the Internet, according to a Chinese spokesman, Liu Jianchao. The issue ''absolutely did not come up,'' Mr. Liu said. But in the other Washington the next day -- the day before Mr. Hu's arrival -- China's misdeeds were the subject of a Congressional subcommittee hearing.
 ''The Chinese government has violated its international obligations with respect to currency manipulation, export subsidies and intellectual property rights,'' said Thea M. Lee, policy director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., in a statement delivered at the hearing. But ''addressing the Chinese government's massive violations of human rights and workers' rights is the top priority.'' 
 There is a cultural component. ''In the Pacific Northwest we have a greater appreciation of the importance of trade with Asian countries because we have large Asian populations,'' said Gary Locke, a Chinese-American who until last year was Washington's governor.
 Yet while the disparate receptions awarded Mr. Hu would appear to indicate a deep divide in the United States' approach to China, the breach, in fact, might not be so deep: never mind the talk, nobody really wants to rock the boat.
 The administration has non-economic reasons to stay on good terms with China, a crucial player in dealing with the nuclear threats from Iran and North Korea, among other things. But equally important, the United States' growing economic ties to China have produced big winners across the country. For all the angst over the trade deficit and the fighting words in the capital about forcing China to change its economic policies and respect human rights, these winners will work hard to maintain the status quo.
 Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington who was a trade official in the Carter administration, counts more than 30 significant bills concerning Chinese trade practices proposed in Congress over the past three years. Still, he says, ''there are concentrated beneficiaries who will keep temperatures from erupting.''
 Mainstream economists say that trade with China generates net benefits for the United States, like lower prices for consumers. But a coarser tally of winning and losing interests is what determines the nation's China policy. Broadly speaking, the losers are American-based manufacturers and their workers, who are undercut by China's cheap labor. Those manufacturers have relatively little economic clout, however, generating only a tenth of the nation's jobs. And they are no match for the interests on the other side of the ledger: Wall Street banks who want to set up shop in China; American companies with investments in China; firms that rely on Chinese suppliers; Wal-Mart.
 And this list doesn't even take into account arguably the biggest beneficiary of them all: the United States Treasury. At the end of February, China owned $265 billion worth of American Treasury bonds. 
 If China were to begin a fire sale of these and other American securities -- perhaps as part of a policy to loosen the yuan's peg to the dollar -- American interest rates could increase significantly, delivering a powerful blow to the housing market and consumer spending. 
 ''If you raise interest rates by 150 to 200 basis points on the long end I don't see how the Republicans could win an election,'' Mr. Hufbauer said.
 Even as President Bush warns China not to hoard energy resources and senators advise China to let its currency loose, Mr. Hu can probably trust that the approach taken in the Washington on the West Coast will carry the day. 
 And in the Washington on the West Coast, measures like trade sanctions are a no-no. ''That would be seen as a confrontation; it would be hugely damaging to the relationship,'' Ms. Gregoire said. ''We understand that much of what you can do with China is built on relationships.''

HEADLINE: China and Sudan, Blood and Oil

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
Americans make a habit of bashing China for all the wrong reasons.
 It's hypocritical of us to scream at President Hu Jintao, as we did during his visit last week, about China's undervalued currency. Sure, that's a problem for the world economy -- but not nearly as much as our own budget deficits, caused by tax cuts we couldn't afford.
 We're now addicted to capital from China and other foreign countries, and that should be a concern. But our deficits aren't China's fault, and junkies like us don't have any basis to complain about the moral turpitude of those who supply cheap capital or other narcotics. 
 But there are two good reasons to complain to President Hu. First, he has presided over a broad clampdown on freedom of expression in China, including the imprisonment for 19 months of my colleague Zhao Yan, an employee of The New York Times.
 Second, China is now underwriting its second genocide in three decades. The first was in Pol Pot's Cambodia, and the second is in Darfur, Sudan. Chinese oil purchases have financed Sudan's pillage of Darfur, Chinese-made AK-47's have been the main weapons used to slaughter several hundred thousand people in Darfur so far, and China has protected Sudan in the U.N. Security Council.
 Indeed, it's because of China's support that Sudan felt it could get away this month with sending a proxy army to invade neighboring Chad.
 For more than two years now, I've been holding President Bush's feet to the fire over his refusal to make the Darfur genocide a priority for his administration. But Mr. Bush has taken half-steps in the right direction -- including pushing President Hu to cooperate on Darfur -- and that's more than can be said of the leaders of most other countries. Europe has snored through this genocide. Then there's the Arab League, which met last month in Sudan, in effect legitimizing the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of Muslims (almost all the victims in Darfur are Muslim).
 As Fatema Abdul Rasul wrote in The Daily Star of Lebanon this month: ''For the entire Muslim and Arab world to remain silent when thousands of people in Darfur continue to be killed is shameful and hypocritical.'' Do you hear that, Hosni?
 And where's the Arab press? Isn't the murder of 300,000 or more Muslims almost as offensive as a Danish cartoon?
 The biggest obstacle to forceful action is China. The latest outrage came a few days ago when the U.S. and Britain tried to impose the most feeble possible sanctions -- targeting just four people, including a midlevel Sudanese official. China and Russia blocked even that pathetic action.
 Why is China soft on genocide?
 The essential reason is oil. China traditionally was self-sufficient in oil, but since 1993 it has been a net oil importer and it is increasingly worried about this vulnerability.
 So China has been bustling around the globe trying to ensure oil supplies from as many sources as possible. And partly because most of the major oil fields are already taken, China has ended up with the world's thugs: Sudan, Iran and Myanmar. China has been particularly active in Africa.
 About 60 percent of Sudan's oil flows to China, and Beijing has a close economic and even military relationship with Khartoum. A recent Council on Foreign Relations report on Africa notes that China has supplied Sudan with small arms, anti-personnel mines, howitzers, tanks, helicopters and ammunition. China has even established three arms factories in Sudan, and you see Chinese-made AK-47's, rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns all over Darfur. 
 Last month in a village on the Chad-Sudan border, I interviewed a man who told how a Sudanese militia had grabbed his baby boy, Ahmed Haroun, thrown Ahmed to the ground and shot him in the chest. The odds are overwhelming that that gun and those bullets came from China.
 Likewise, the women and children I've seen torn apart by bullets in Darfur and Chad -- that lead and steel was molded in Chinese factories. When women are raped and mutilated in Darfur, the gun barrels pointed at their heads are Made in China. 
 Let's hope China's 13 million bloggers take up this issue, for this has received very little attention in China but it is not so sensitive that discussion of it will get anyone arrested.
 One of the central questions for the 21st century will be whether China's rise will be accompanied by increasingly responsible behavior in its international relations. Darfur is a test, and for now China is failing.

HEADLINE: Son of the Bridge to Nowhere

 BODY:
It was only last month that the Senate staged a breast-beating debate about the need to control the rampant pork-spending abuse of earmarks -- boondoggle appropriations tucked into vital legislation with little public scrutiny. Senator Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi, orated on the side of the angels in calling for reform. Well, the angels have lost another player. As the Senate returns from recess it will confront the year's prize porker blithely trotted out by Senator Lott -- a $700 million earmark to relocate a Gulf Coast rail line, which was just rebuilt, post-Katrina, at a cost of $250 million. 
 Invoked in the name of public safety, the project is actually a transparent attempt to tap already scarce hurricane reconstruction funds so the rail bed can be replaced by a touristy ''beach boulevard'' long sought by Mississippi to aid the casino industry and coastal developers. The railroad relocation dwarfs the $223 million ''bridge to nowhere'' proposed for the Alaska outback, the giveaway that brought all the vows for reform from Congress.
Even worse, Senator Lott and his fellow Mississippi Republican, Thad Cochran, are attaching this frivolous add-on to a bill that is supposed to be used to pay for emergencies -- specifically the war in Iraq and hurricane reconstruction. 
 Senator Lott angrily resents any description of his pet project as a right of way to the slot machines. He insists the rail line needs higher ground and his constituents better protection. But it seems clear the twin traumas of Iraq and Katrina are being used as cover. Economic development is a fine goal for the Gulf Coast, but it deserves careful consideration, not a devious rush to the pork barrel.
 This earmark is particularly objectionable considering that Senator Lott, as a principal in the recent ethics debate, helped produce the half-hearted swipe at the problem that the Senate passed as a supposed fix for earmarking. Now Senator Tom Coburn, the Oklahoma Republican who has made total disclosure of all earmarks a cause, plans to challenge the railroad money when the $107 billion Iraq spending bill comes to the floor. His colleagues should seize this second chance to take a truly credible stand against pork, while protecting Katrina funds for the real needs of reconstruction.

HEADLINE: Great Wall of Fluff

 BODY:
It's hard to imagine how a meeting between the leaders of the world's two most powerful nations could seem insignificant. But that's what happened by the time the White House finished downgrading the protocol, lowering the expectations and erasing the substance for President Hu Jintao's visit.
 It's not as if presidents of China came to the White House very often. (The last time was nine years ago.) And it's not as if there were no issues of immense importance. (Just take the world's dwindling fossil fuels and growing nuclear arsenals, then move on to trade and human rights.) 
Surely Presidents Bush and Hu could have given the impression that they were talking over important matters. Instead all they appeared to do was agree to disagree and offer up a series of smiling photo ops in which there was no substance behind the smiles. Mr. Bush could not even manage to give Mr. Hu the state dinner he wanted, so the Chinese leader made his first stop in the other Washington and met with the head of Microsoft before the leader of the free world.
 Any progress, no matter how small, on the really big issues like energy and nonproliferation would have required the two presidents to spend major political capital. But no capital spending plans were announced -- perhaps because Mr. Bush does not have a lot to spend and Mr. Hu is not willing to dip into his own account. Or perhaps that might have gotten in the way of the choreography, which a Falun Gong protester managed to disrupt anyway. 
 The United States, the world's top energy guzzler, and China, with the world's fastest-growing energy thirst, both need to make adjustments so that their combined demand does not send oil prices through the roof. Already China's scramble to lock up energy supplies is cutting across American foreign policy goals, like putting pressure on Iran and Sudan. But China is not prepared to discuss changing its ways unless America is prepared to finally become serious about conservation and efficiency.
 It is the same when it comes to putting serious pressure on those countries whose nuclear weapons programs most concern Washington. China is reluctant to tighten the screws on Iran, from which it buys oil, and North Korea, whose collapse would create major problems along their shared border.
 To overcome that reluctance, Mr. Bush would have to be willing to talk about things like offering those countries economic incentives, security guarantees and access to civilian nuclear fuel if they verifiably renounce their nuclear ambitions. 
 On trade, the two countries have a common interest in resisting growing protectionist pressures in Congress, where China is wrongly being blamed for economic and fiscal problems the United States has largely brought on itself. This is another discussion Mr. Bush is not very eager to get into.
 The visit's least excusable failure was on human rights, where the pre-existing script would have done fine. When Mr. Hu's predecessor, Jiang Zemin, came to the White House in 1997, he and President Bill Clinton held a joint news conference where Mr. Clinton publicly urged his guest to expand political freedoms in China. It's an honored ritual of American democracy. But this time Mr. Bush agreed to downgrade the news conference to a few questions from the White House pool. He may have thought he was doing Mr. Hu a favor, but it is a favor China's repressed people will not appreciate.

HEADLINE: A Carrot, a Stick and the Hungry

 BODY:
Mayor Michael Bloomberg is inexplicably resisting an opportunity to ease one of his predecessor's crueler legacies, a policy allowing the automatic cutoff of food stamp assistance to childless adults who fail to meet a work requirement. 
 Federal policy requires a suspension of benefits for able-bodied childless adults if they fail to work 80 hours a month for three months. But cities can seek a waiver to extend eligibility, and many have.
 Mr. Bloomberg's lieutenants were in fact seeking such a waiver when the Mayor dug in his heels, bucking advice from Verna Eggleston, the chief of the Human Resources Administration, who seems herself to have done a turnaround on the waiver, and Linda Gibbs, the respected deputy who leads social services. 
 ''I'm a firm believer that people should have to work for a living,'' Mr. Bloomberg said, explaining his rationale. This seemed to suggest a belief that people who are unemployed simply don't want to work. But there are many reasons why able-bodied people can and do run afoul of the rules: mental or other illness, difficulty in finding work, the failure of the bureaucracy to match a person with workfare or job training opportunities, to name a few.
 Mr. Bloomberg's stinginess is reminiscent of Rudolph Giuliani's Dickensian approach toward the poor; Mr. Giuliani, it will be recalled, lumped food stamps with welfare, and promised to demolish both. Mr. Bloomberg's attitude also seems oddly out of step with his broader efforts to alleviate poverty and encourage self-sufficiency. Evidence suggests that food stamps support those very goals. Furthermore, food stamps cost the city almost nothing; it's federal money, there for the city's dispensing.
 For his entire first term, Mr. Bloomberg shrugged off mounting criticism from anti-hunger organizations and from other city officials, chiefly the Public Advocate, Betsy Gotbaum, and members of the City Council, including Bill de Blasio and Eric Gioia. The new Council speaker, Christine Quinn, has made the reduction of hunger a priority.
 In his defense, Mr. Bloomberg points to a rise of some 30 percent in food stamp distribution under his watch. But that obscures a larger truth: the number of people receiving food stamps remains agonizingly low. As many as 600,000 New Yorkers who are eligible for the food assistance are not receiving it. The Bloomberg administration has twice been sued for its management of the program.
 Under pressure, the city has lowered a few bureaucratic hurdles, streamlining forms, increasing outreach to poor communities and allowing application by fax and computer. Even so, the process of applying for assistance is discouraging, down to the requirement that applicants be fingerprinted.
 More than one million people in New York, many of them working poor, are not sure where their next meal is coming from. They are the people who line up daily at privately run soup kitchens and pantries, which -- even with some city support -- have become horribly strained.
 Obtaining a waiver of an onerous federal regulation does not guarantee a free lunch for the hungry; it merely gives the city flexibility in enforcing the law. The 80-hour work rule would still apply; city officials could end a person's food stamp aid, or decide to continue it.
 Mr. de Blasio's office estimates that some 25,000 childless adults who need food aid are not receiving it, in large part because of unnecessarily rigid enforcement. The city maintains that in any given month only about 110 people are taken off food stamp rolls for failing to work. 
 It's hard to imagine what goal is achieved by holding tight to a small-minded regulation that keeps these hard luck cases from eating. On this, the city and the mayor should think and act bigger.

HEADLINE: Little Comfort for Corzine In School Budget Rejections

BYLINE: By David Kocieniewski. 
David Kocieniewski reports from New Jersey for The New York Times.

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
Gov. Jon S. Corzine may be a low-key, low-volume New Jersey chief executive, but state residents appear to be hearing him quite clearly.
 After years of blaring headlines about corrupt politicos, Mr. Corzine won the support of many New Jerseyans because his soft-spoken demeanor and button-down Wall Street resume seemed to offer a long overdue chance to hit the mute button.
Unlike Mr. Corzine's pledge to double property-tax rebates and resist the pressure to increase taxes, the new governor has so far kept his promise to conduct a quieter, gentler administration. During his first three months in office, Mr. Corzine has kept a comparatively limited public schedule. His budget address was most notable for two things: its bevy of tax increases and the audible silence with which it was received, even by fellow Democrats. 
 He has focused so intently on hacking through the fiscal problems he inherited that Mr. Corzine has made few of the sweeping proposals or grand gestures that may identify him with some overarching agenda or rousing public cause.
 But for all the relief Mr. Corzine's low profile may provide to the scandal-weary, it carries some significant political liabilities. Modern politics is a combat fought with attack ads and killer sound bites, so if you're too slow or soft-spoken to define yourself, events or your opponents will do it for you.
 During the campaign, Mr. Corzine's millions helped him beat back Republican assertions that he was an aloof, elitist, big-taxing, free-spending liberal. Since Mr. Corzine took office, however, his actions have largely spoken for themselves, and the public has been none too impressed. An assortment of recent polls show that voters object to his call to raise the sales tax a penny, to 7 cents, and there have been sporadic protests from state university students angry that the new budget will increase their tuition.
 Last Tuesday the latest public response came when residents went to the polls to vote on school budgets and rejected nearly half of them, results far more negative than the state has seen in more than a decade.
 Mr. Corzine's name wasn't on any of the ballots, and the turnout was only 15 percent. But school budgets are largely dependent on state aid, which the governor has proposed freezing again in his budget plan. Even worse, the remedy that most districts use for additional funds is an increase in property taxes, the third rail of New Jersey politics.
 So the fact that only 53 percent of the school budgets passed -- down from 71 percent a year ago -- can hardly be considered comforting news in Trenton. While the frustration is being communicated more subtlety than the outcry that greeted former Gov. Jim Florio's notorious tax increases in 1990, when ''Impeach Florio'' bumper stickers traversed the turnpike and voters protested the tax on paper products by emblazoning the governor's likeness on bathroom tissue, the message is unmistakable.
 New Jerseyans are taxed out.
 Most of the interested political players pointed their fingers in predictable directions -- at one another. Republicans called for Mr. Corzine and his fellow Democrats to apologize to the state's schoolchildren. Democrats blamed a favorite bogeyman -- years of bureaucratic fraud, waste and abuse, as if none of those frauds, wastrels or abusers belonged to their party.
 For his part, Mr. Corzine responded with a more comprehensive view, saying that the state's educational-finance problems were being fueled by inefficiency and judicial intervention, namely the court order that forces New Jersey to finance low-income districts at the same level as the wealthiest ones.
 ''We've got to save money, we need to make sure that we start squeezing out corruption,'' he said during a radio broadcast on New Jersey 101.5 the day the school results were announced. ''We're going to need a new school funding formula because I think we have a system today where we're more focused on the districts than we are the kids.''
 But his proposed solutions, a citizen's property-tax commission and a rollback of the state's school financing formula, are unlikely to ever happen and even less likely to produce the kind of drastic reduction in taxes that may make a noticeable difference in people's pocketbooks.
 So as Mr. Corzine nears the benchmark of his first 100 days in office, you have to wonder precisely how he expects the public to regard him.
 He portrays himself as a steady hand at the helm, someone willing to make the difficult fiscal decisions and avoid the temptation to promise expensive new goodies. In the meantime, Republicans are shouting that he's the governor whose policies raised your sales tax, college tuition and property taxes. And voters appear to be growing restless.
 It could be that Mr. Corzine is just biding his time before presenting good news to the public. Maybe his friends on Wall Street have informed him that contrary to most predictions, the economy will soon rev up, providing a windfall for the governor to dole out. Or perhaps he wants to get the budget squared away before announcing some major initiative like a plan to strengthen and reorganize the state's public universities, cut health insurance costs or offer property tax relief to homeowners.
 Because if Mr. Corzine truly believes that voters will be grateful to an elected official who makes them eat their spinach as long as he's quiet and polite about it, so far there has been little evidence out there to back him up.

HEADLINE: State Adds a Fleet Of Fuel Efficient Cars

BYLINE: By JEFF HOLTZ

 BODY:
The state has bought 575 fuel efficient cars and trucks for state use, Gov. M. Jodi Rell announced Monday. 
 The State Department of Administrative Services said that 428 of the new vehicles run on ethanol. The other 175 are hybrids that use gasoline and electricity. 
 Among the models are the Honda Civic, the Toyota Prius, the Chevy Silverado and the Ford Escape. ''Most of the four-wheel-drive vehicles are being used by Department of Environmental Protection personnel who are in the field,'' said Donna J. Micklus, a spokeswoman for the Department of Administrative Services. ''The rest are being used by agencies with high-mileage use.''
 According to the agency, the models were chosen based on the Model Year 2005 Fuel Economy Guide published by the federal government. 
 The state will gradually replace other vehicles in its fleet with similar cars and trucks through 2008, Ms. Micklus said. JEFF HOLTZ

HEADLINE: Avoiding Political Talk, Saudis and Chinese Build Trade 

BYLINE: By HASSAN M. FATTAH; Massoud Derhally contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
As President Hu Jintao of China made his first state visit to Saudi Arabia yesterday, his arrival in Riyadh offered the latest sign of shifting winds across the oil-rich Persian Gulf region: China has grown as a major market for oil, and Arab states have begun turning to it as an alternative to the United States and Europe in other areas. 
 ''We are opening new channels, we are heading east,'' said Prince Walid bin Talal, a billionaire investor and member of the royal family. ''China is a big consumer of oil. Saudi Arabia needs to open new channels beyond the West. So this is good for both of us.'' 
Mr. Hu and King Abdullah signed a series of agreements to strengthen cooperation in several areas yesterday, including energy exploration and security, Agence France-Presse reported.
 Mr. Hu also plans to meet with Saudi businessmen and today is scheduled to become one of the few foreign leaders ever to address the Shura, the consultative council that advises the king and cabinet. He is also expected to visit East Province, Saudi Arabia's premier oil-producing region.
 For decades, many Middle Eastern countries saw China as a source of low price, low quality goods or, worse, as a Marxist threat that armed rebel groups in the region during the 1950's and 1960's. But relations warmed in the 1990's, and oil trade boomed. 
 Now, interest in China and other Asian countries is rising throughout the Arab world. In Dubai, the sprawling Chinamex Mart, a mall of Chinese businesses, is seeking to become the largest distribution hub for Chinese products in the region. Chinese diplomats are making their presence felt on the society pages of local newspapers, and airlines in the region have been adding flights to Asian capitals. University courses in Chinese history and language have become more popular than ever.
 ''Saudi leaders are moving from benign neglect of China to considering it as a long-term partner,'' said Samuel Blatteis, a Fulbright fellow who has studied the growing ties between China and the Persian Gulf. ''China is no longer the only side doing the courting.''
 Part of what makes China an especially attractive business partner for Saudis is a hands-off approach to domestic policy. Discussions with the Chinese focus on economics and rarely on politics, businessmen say.
 China has been willing to do business with Iran and other states isolated by the United States, and can sell technology without the encumbrance of requirements for Congressional or parliamentary approval. 
 ''With the Chinese there are no strings attached,'' said Gal Luft, co-director of the Institute for the Analysis of Global Security. ''They don't talk to you about democracy or reform. They give money, the Saudis give oil and there are no hidden agendas. The Saudis find those kinds of relationships more appealing.''
 In 2004, the two countries agreed to hold more regular political consultations while Sinopec, China's state-owned oil company, signed a deal to explore for gas in the forbidding deserts known as the Empty Quarter. Last year, Saudi Aramco signed a $3.6 billion deal with Exxon Mobil and Sinopec for a joint oil refining and chemicals venture in south Fujian Province. Talks are continuing with Sinopec regarding investing in a plant in the northern Chinese port city of Qingdao.
 Relations became even closer in January, when King Abdullah visited Beijing and signed a memorandum of understanding for greater cooperation and investment in oil, natural gas and minerals. 
 Saudi oil sales to China have more than doubled in recent years, and now account for almost 17 percent of China's oil imports. Trade between the countries exceeded $15 billion in 2005, having grown an average of 41 percent a year since 1999, according to the Chinese Ministry of Commerce.
 ''When you have a country of 1.3 billion people growing at 10 percent annually, importing millions of tons of oil, Saudi Arabia has to be there,'' Prince Walid said. ''It's clear Saudi Arabia is going where its interests are, and China is going where its interests are.''
 Strained relations with the United States since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks have also pushed Saudi interests toward China, where businessmen can travel without waiting months for a visa, as they do to visit the United States, said Omar Bahlaiwa, secretary general for the Committee for International Trade, a branch of the Saudi Chambers of Commerce.
 And the recent outcry from Congress and the American public over the possibility of having ports controlled by a company in Dubai sent a loud message to the Arab world, convincing many businessmen that their fortunes now lie in the East, Mr. Bahlaiwa and others say. 
 China's growing technological and military prowess only adds to the interest. That avenue was opened in the late 1980's, when China supplied Saudi Arabia with intermediate-range ballistic missiles. Now, if the United States balks at offering modern weaponry to the Saudis, China would again be a logical source.
 ''Things have changed because there has been a shake-up in the balance of power,'' said Muhammad Bin Huweiden, a political science professor at Emirates University in the United Arab Emirates who researches Chinese-Arab relations. ''With the growing power of the Shia, and Iran, Saudi Arabia has felt cornered, and it has begun to look eastward. They are betting that the balance of power may be achieved again by going to the Chinese.''
 Yet Saudis are quick to note that China's gain is not necessarily America's loss. China cannot provide the security guarantees that the United States has to most of the countries in the Persian Gulf. In that light, the idea that Saudi Arabia would turn entirely to China can also be seen as a bit of political stagecraft. 
 ''We are in a Catholic marriage with America,'' Mr. Bahlaiwa said, emphasizing that divorce is unthinkable. ''But we are also Muslims -- we can have more than one wife.''

HEADLINE: Azerbaijan Leader, Under Fire, Hopes U.S. Visit Improves Image

BYLINE: By C. J. CHIVERS

DATELINE: MOSCOW, April 19 

 BODY:
Next week, after years of waiting for an unequivocal nod of Western approval, President Ilham H. Aliyev of Azerbaijan will fly to Washington to be received at the White House, a visit his administration hopes will lift his stature.
 Being a guest of President Bush has been billed in Mr. Aliyev's circle as a chance for the 44-year-old president -- dogged by allegations of corruption, election rigging and repression of opposition figures -- to gain more international legitimacy.
''We have long waited for this visit,'' said Ali Gasanov, a senior presidential adviser. ''Now it has been scheduled, and we hope that we will be able to discuss global issues.''
 For President Bush, who has made democracy promotion a prominent theme of his foreign policy, Mr. Aliyev's visit could prove tricky. 
 Mr. Aliyev's invitation arrived during a period of increasing diplomatic difficulties between the United States and both Russia and Iran, countries that border Azerbaijan. 
 But while Azerbaijan's strategic location could hardly be better and its relations with the United States have mostly been warm, no leader in the region more fully embodies the conflicting American objectives in the former Soviet Union than its president. 
 Mr. Aliyev is a secular Muslim politician who is steering oil and gas to Western markets and who has given political and military support to the Iraq war. But his administration has never held a clean election and has used riot police to crush antigovernment demonstrations. 
 The invitation, made last week, has raised eyebrows in the former Soviet world, where Mr. Bush's calls for democratization have increased tensions between opposition movements and the entrenched autocrats.
 Opposition leaders have long said the United States' desires to diversify Western energy sources and to encourage democratic growth have collided in Azerbaijan. By inviting Mr. Aliyev to the White House, they say, Mr. Bush has made a choice: oil and location now trump other concerns. 
 Ali Kerimli, leader of the Popular Front of Azerbaijan, noted that when Mr. Aliyev was elected in 2003 in a vote deemed neither free nor fair, the White House withheld an invitation, awaiting improvement by Azerbaijan in promoting civil society and recognizing human rights. 
 ''It is difficult for Azerbaijan's democratic forces to understand what changed,'' said Mr. Kerimli, who was beaten by the police as were several thousand demonstrators during a crackdown on a protest over fraudulent parliamentary elections last fall. The demonstration had been peaceful until the police rushed in with clubs.
 ''I think the White House must explain what has happened when three years ago Aliyev was not wanted for a reception in the White House, and now he falsifies another election and is received,'' Mr. Kerimli said. 
 American officials insist nothing has changed, and say Mr. Aliyev has been invited for what they call a ''working visit,'' during which he will be urged to liberalize his government and its economy, which is tightly controlled by state officials and clans. 
 ''If we are going to elevate our relationship with Azerbaijan to something that is qualitatively different, then there has to be progress on democratic and market reforms,'' a senior State Department official said. ''I am sure we will talk in these clear and blunt terms.''
 The United States' relationship with Azerbaijan rests on three principal issues: access to energy resources, international security cooperation, and democratic and economic change. 
 On the first two issues, the United States has made clear it is satisfied. Mr. Aliyev has supported new pipelines to pump Caspian hydrocarbons away from Russia and Iran to Western customers, and provided troops to United States-led military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. 
 Azerbaijan also grants overflight rights to the American military and is cooperating with a Pentagon-sponsored modernization of a former Soviet airfield that could be used by American military planes. 
 Mr. Aliyev often welcomes foreign delegations to Baku, the capital, describing in smooth English his efforts to push his nation toward Western models of democracy and free markets.
 But Azerbaijan has remained undemocratic. No election under Mr. Aliyev or his late father, Heydar Aliyev, has been judged free or fair by the main international observers. Instead, fraud and abuse of state resources for chosen candidates have been widespread. 
 Ilham Aliyev's government maintains a distinctly Soviet-era state television network and has elevated Heydar Aliyev to the status of a minor personality cult figure. 
 Moreover, Azerbaijan's government is often described as one of the world's most corrupt. A criminal case now in federal court in New York against three international speculators describes enormous shakedowns and bribes in the late 1990's at Socar, Azerbaijan's state oil company. Mr. Aliyev was a Socar vice president at the time. 
 Last year the Azerbaijani government showed signs of paranoia, arresting several people shortly before the parliamentary election and accusing them of plotting an armed coup. 
 Public evidence for the charges has been scarce, and a lawyer for two of the men held in solitary confinement for months since -- Farhad Aliyev, the former minister of economics, and his brother Rafiq -- has urged Congress to raise issues of their treatment when Mr. Aliyev comes to Washington. (The president is not related to the accused men.)
 American officials say that Azerbaijan has been liberalizing slowly, and evolving into a more responsible state. But given Mr. Aliyev's uneven record and the allegations against him, his visit has raised fresh questions about the degree to which American standards are malleable. 
 ''Russian public opinion, when it looks at the United States policy in Azerbaijan, cannot ignore the fact that the United States has a desire not in favor of democracy but in favor of profits and geopolitical domination,'' said Sergei Markov, director of the Institute for Political Studies here and a Kremlin adviser.
 Mr. Markov and others have noted that the West has penalized Belarus for police crackdowns after tainted elections last month.
 ''This is one of the reasons that Russian public opinion is very suspicious of United States policies in the former Soviet political sphere, and its propaganda about democracy,'' Mr. Markov said. 
 ''Ilham Aliyev will be in the White House not because he promotes democracy,'' Mr. Markov said. ''He will be in the White House because he controls oil.''
 In Armenia, Mr. Aliyev's invitation has also generated interest.
 Armenia fought Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh, a wedge of territory within Azerbaijan's boundaries that each country claims. The conflict has been frozen for several years, but Mr. Aliyev's recent statements have often been bellicose.
 ''The visit at this time should not be viewed as appreciation of their democratic or other policies,'' Vartan Oskanian, Armenia's foreign minister, said via e-mail.

HEADLINE: The Outsiders

BYLINE: By David Gergen. 
David Gergen is a professor of public service and director of the Center for Public Leadership at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. He was a White House adviser to four presidents.

DATELINE: Cambridge, Mass. 

 BODY:
YOU probably remember this old joke. Question: How many psychiatrists does it take to change a light bulb? Answer: Only one, but the light bulb has to want to change. It's a punch line that comes to mind these days as President Bush fights the darkness by rearranging his team. 
 Mr. Bush is the eighth straight president, stretching back to Lyndon Johnson, who has tried to rescue his administration at a low moment by shaking up his staff. It has rarely worked, and on the few occasions when it has, the two crucial factors have been that the president has acted in time and, critically, has wanted to make fundamental changes. 
We have not yet seen the end of the current reshuffling and should not underestimate Josh Bolten, the extremely capable new chief of staff. But these changes probably come too late, and so far, Mr. Bush seems to be acting only reluctantly, while remaining firmly opposed to instituting fundamental change. 
 President Johnson also acted half-heartedly and at the eleventh hour, as the Vietnam War dragged on late in his presidency. He dispatched his defense secretary, Robert McNamara, to the World Bank and brought in a trusted outside heavyweight, Clark Clifford, who studied the war and decided it ought to be wound down. But there was too little time left, and President Johnson, a captive of his own thinking, as Stephen Hess has written, made only modest changes in policy. A few months later, he withdrew from his race for re-election.
 I was a young member of the White House staff when the Watergate break-in was reported in the summer of 1971. I continue to believe that if President Richard Nixon had quickly come clean, overhauled his team and asked for public forgiveness, he would have still won re-election in 1972 and might have become a respected president. But instead he refused to change. He waited until 1973 to oust his chief of staff, H. R. Haldeman, and advisers like John Ehrlichman and John Dean. Even then, he was just tossing morsels to the wolves at the door. Some leaders are perhaps incapable of changing their core character and beliefs. That's a thought that gives pause today. 
 For one president, reshuffling his team actually backfired. Persuaded by his pollster, Pat Caddell, and in the face of skyrocketing gas prices and sagging poll numbers, President Jimmy Carter retreated to Camp David in the summer of 1979 for 10 excruciating days to reflect on his troubles with the help of prominent leaders from outside his administration. He then came down from the mountain to deliver his famous ''crisis of confidence'' speech, also known as the ''malaise speech,'' and propose bold new energy plans. 
 The public at first received the speech well, and President Carter's approval ratings improved. But the polls went into reverse a few days later, when he fired half his cabinet. Sensing that the president had lost control of his team and was desperate, the public gave him some of the lowest poll numbers of any president in modern times. Karl Rove has no doubt taken note.
 Shaking up a team clearly worked, though, for President Ronald Reagan in 1986, when his administration was devastated by the Iran-contra scandal. Until then, President Reagan had struck a deep chord of trust with the public; even people who didn't like his policies thought they could put their faith in him and liked him personally. The Iran-contra affair challenged that image with its suggestion of scandal and duplicity. The imbroglio sent his approval ratings plummeting into the 40's and even brought rumblings about impeachment. 
 President Reagan's response to that situation could serve the current administration as a model of recovery. Not only did Mr. Reagan bring in an outstanding new team of outsiders -- people like Howard Baker, Frank Carlucci, Ken Duberstein and Colin Powell -- but he also swiftly changed the way he did business. Counseled by David Abshire, his special adviser on Iran-Contra affairs, and others, he opened White House files to scrutiny, waived executive privilege so that Congress could interrogate anybody it liked, reached out seriously to Democrats and changed the tone in Washington. The road thereafter was not always smooth, but President Reagan went on to achieve many of his goals at home and abroad, leaving office with an approval rating in the 60's.
 President Clinton, too, was a leader who could change when things veered off course. I was a part of one of the Clinton shake-ups, joining the administration as his White House counselor when he was in trouble in the middle of his first year in office. Six months later, he had climbed out of the ditch and was on his way again. 
 It wasn't what I or others on staff did that ultimately made the difference. Rather, it was Mr. Clinton himself, with the support of his wife, Hillary. He acted early enough that he still had a reservoir of good will, and he made a genuine effort to alter the way he functioned.
 Mr. Bush should have embraced the Reagan model of recovery last fall, when many urged it in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and the indictment of I. Lewis Libby. He had a decent chance to rebuild his presidency at that time. But he refused to change anything, choosing instead to ''hang in'' with the same policies, politics and personnel. Half a year has now passed, allowing the attitudes of those who were losing faith then to crystallize and harden. 
 The current shuffle is coming extremely late for a recovery -- too late, probably -- and so far, the administration has not brought in any outside heavyweights. The timing and nature of the shake-up signals that Mr. Bush's primary interest is in better management and marketing. Those will help, but they almost certainly will not be enough to rescue his presidency from its low approval ratings and loss of public confidence. 
 Mr. Bush has to want to change. He has to want to change policies like those on Iraq, energy and taxes; practices like secrecy; and politics like those that cater only to his base. Is he a leader whose resolve will ultimately become self-defeating stubbornness, or is he capable of flexibility, like his hero President Reagan? Much rides on the answer.

HEADLINE: Energy Politics on Earth Day As Bush Tours California

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER

DATELINE: INDIAN WELLS, Calif., April 22 

 BODY:
President Bush spent an Earth Day marked by record-high gas prices promoting his support for hydrogen-powered fuel cell cars, but Democrats said that the vehicles were years away from reality and that the president needed to do more to relieve sticker shock at the pump.
 Such was the state of the political battle over gas prices on Saturday, when Mr. Bush went to West Sacramento to tour the California Fuel Cell Partnership, a consortium of 31 car makers, energy companies and government agencies, and Democrats fired off press releases from Washington attacking the administration's energy plans. 
''This nation does not have to choose between a strong economy and a clean environment,'' Mr. Bush said in remarks at the Fuel Cell Partnership, where he was flanked by two boxy-looking prototype hydrogen cars. ''We can have both at the same time.''
 Cars powered by fuel cells combine hydrogen and oxygen from the air in a chemical reaction. Mr. Bush said there were about 100 hydrogen cars on California roads, but as of late last year, only one was being tested by consumers, the Spallino family of Redondo Beach, Calif., who had an experimental Honda FCX worth about $1 million.
 ''I strongly believe hydrogen is the fuel of the future,'' Mr. Bush said, adding that he thought that today's children would take their driving tests in hydrogen-powered cars.
 Mr. Bush's remarks came as part of an effort to appear proactive about the problem of high gas prices, one that Democrats are increasingly using against the Republicans in this midterm election year. 
 Although the president declared in his State of the Union address that ''America is addicted to oil'' and then presented a series of alternative energy proposals, Democrats have said the plans are not adequate. Mr. Bush, they say, should address consumption more aggressively and not oppose higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars.
 In a Democratic response to Mr. Bush, Senator Bill Nelson of Florida said the president needed to take ''more dramatic steps,'' including conservation and raising the mileage standard for all passenger vehicles to at least 40 miles per gallon.
 ''The crisis is coming,'' Mr. Nelson said. ''And so America must act now, before soaring prices and a dependence on foreign oil puts a chokehold on our economy and military.''
 Mr. Bush's energy proposals for the fiscal year that begins in October call for $289 million for hydrogen fuel technology, up from $53 million this year; $54 million for coal plants that would capture the carbon dioxide they produce; $148 million for solar power, up from $65 million this year; $44 million for wind power, up $5 million from this year; and $150 million for ethanol from cellulose, up $59 million from this year.
 The General Motors Corporation and the Department of Energy have committed $44 million to a fuel cell demonstration project, with G.M. pledging to put 40 fuel cell vehicles on the road in New York, Washington, California and Michigan by 2009. The department has also signed fuel cell development agreements with the Ford Motor Company, DaimlerChrysler and the Hyundai Motor Company as part of a broader, five-year, $1.2 billion hydrogen initiative announced by Mr. Bush in his 2003 State of the Union address.
 Mr. Bush began Earth Day with a bike ride through a foggy redwood forest in the Napa Valley wine country, where he had spent the night after a dinner on the Stanford University campus.
 Mr. Bush headed later in the day to a fund-raiser for the Republican National Committee in Indian Wells, where he raised $2 million, and was to remain overnight on Sunday in Rancho Mirage.

HEADLINE: Pennsylvania Senate Campaign Tests Democrats' Abortion Tack 

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: LANCASTER, Pa., April 20 

 BODY:
As the Democratic Party tries to inch its way toward a new, less polarized politics of abortion, seeking some common ground between supporters and opponents of abortion rights, there is no better case study than the Pennsylvania Senate race. 
 Many supporters of abortion rights -- sometimes grudgingly, sometimes led more by their minds than by their hearts -- are lining up behind Bob Casey Jr., a Democratic contender for the Senate who opposes abortion rights. The invitation to a recent Casey event in Philadelphia, raising money for his campaign to unseat Senator Rick Santorum, a Republican, perhaps captured the mood. ''Pragmatic Progressive Women for Casey,'' it declared.
The nine Democratic women in the Senate, including some of the strongest advocates of abortion rights, recently signed a letter of support that struck a similar note, describing Mr. Casey's election as ''critical to our efforts of regaining the majority in the U.S. Senate.'' 
 Mr. Casey himself is emphasizing that while there is ''tremendous disagreement'' on abortion, there is also a broad consensus of which he is a part: to reduce the number of abortions by reducing the number of unintended pregnancies, through greater access to contraception and family planning. 
 Other Democratic leaders have been making similar appeals to this ''prevention consensus,'' including, in an op-ed article this week in The Times Union of Albany, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, a supporter of abortion rights, and Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, who describes himself as pro-life.
 Critics dismiss these efforts as mere political posturing, an effort to obscure the profound divide on abortion's morality and legality. But since the 2004 election, many Democratic strategists have argued that the party must find a way to signal tolerance to opposing views on this issue, and sensitivity to conflicting values.
 Mr. Casey, the state treasurer, an experienced statewide candidate and the son of a popular former governor who also opposed abortion, is a symbol of that ''big tent'' strategy. National party leaders recruited him for this Senate campaign, despite his position on abortion, because they believed he was the strongest potential challenger to Mr. Santorum. With that, they established a high-stakes test: can the Democratic Party, nationally and in the state, rally its abortion-rights base for a candidate who disagrees?
 This tension between principle and pragmatism is apparent across the landscape of the Democratic Party this year, weighing on issues that include the war in Iraq and same-sex marriage. Party strategists are trying to piece together enough winning races to take control of the House and Senate, which means paying close attention to swing voters in the middle. But that strategy angers some on the party's left, most vocally in the blogosphere, who argue that the times demand more than a careful centrism.
 Mr. Casey, all agree, has been helped immensely by the deep animosity among Democrats and abortion-rights supporters toward Mr. Santorum, the third-ranking Republican in the Senate leadership and a staunch social conservative. Mr. Santorum has been a consistent leader in the anti-abortion cause in the Senate. 
 ''We couldn't think any more highly of him,'' said Douglas Johnson, legislative director for the National Right to Life Committee.
 Senator Barbara Boxer, the California Democrat who for many years has squared off against Mr. Santorum on abortion, said she had been ''making the case'' for Mr. Casey ''all over the country,'' arguing that his support for birth control, emergency contraception and international family planning programs made him a ''huge improvement'' over Mr. Santorum. She also reminds her audiences, she said, that Mr. Casey's election would help deliver control of the Senate to the Democrats.
 ''It's a pragmatic choice,'' she said. ''And by the way, to dislodge Santorum is a pro-choice victory.''
 Similarly, Mrs. Clinton played host to a fund-raising reception for Mr. Casey in Chicago last week, and contributed money to his campaign early on. (For all those efforts, Mr. Santorum still has a 2-to-1 cash advantage over Mr. Casey.)
 Not everyone is on board; there is still anger and resistance to the Casey candidacy among some Democrats, which bubbled over in a Democratic primary debate here on Wednesday night. 
 Alan Sandals, a pension lawyer challenging Mr. Casey for the Democratic nomination in the May 16 primary, has argued that abortion rights are under siege and that the party must not waver in its defense. Mr. Sandals was recently endorsed by the National Organization for Women. 
 Chuck Pennacchio, another candidate in the primary, has assailed the party's national establishment for anointing Mr. Casey in defiance of what Mr. Pennacchio asserts Pennsylvania Democrats really want.
 Both candidates sharply criticized Mr. Casey on Wednesday for his endorsement of the Supreme Court nominations of John G. Roberts Jr. and Samuel A. Alito Jr. ''Be brave, Bob,'' Mr. Sandals admonished.
 On the campaign trail, Mr. Casey is in many ways a traditional Democrat of the economic populist school, talking about the plight of average families worried about their jobs, their health insurance and their energy costs. He accuses Mr. Santorum of blindly rubber-stamping Bush administration policies to the detriment of Pennsylvania, ''voting for tax cuts for multimillionaires, even in a time of war.'' He strikes a classic theme for an uneasy time, declaring, ''I say we need a new direction.''
 His spokesman says abortion rarely came up, other than from reporters, although he drew fire on the issue from his primary opponents in two recent debates. In an interview, Mr. Casey highlighted his commitment to reducing unintended pregnancies, which he asserted stood in stark contrast to Mr. Santorum. ''And then there's a whole series of related questions of how do you help a mother and child before and after birth, and his record is terrible on that,'' Mr. Casey asserted.
 A spokeswoman for Mr. Santorum said the senator had voted consistently for spending bills that included family planning programs, and that ''as a matter of public policy, Senator Santorum does not oppose birth control.''
 John Brabender, a media consultant advising the Santorum campaign, argued that Mr. Casey was putting himself into a box on the issue, and risked alienating both conservative Democrats and Republican suburbanites who supported abortion rights. ''This desire to be all things to all people puts him in the category of both sides saying, 'Well, he's not what I thought he was.' '' 
 So far, neither of Mr. Casey's Democratic rivals has broken into double digits in recent polls on the primary. And in a recent survey by Quinnipiac University, pollsters concluded that Mr. Casey's stand was not -- at least so far -- having a major effect in either the Democratic primary or the general election. 
 That survey showed that Mr. Casey retained an 11-percentage-point lead over Mr. Santorum, 48 percent to 37 percent. Two-thirds of the voters said they did not know where Mr. Casey stood on abortion. But only 15 percent of voters, most of them anti-abortion, said they would vote against a candidate on the basis of that issue alone. That poll was conducted March 28 through April 3, based on interviews with 1,354 voters, and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
 Even for some of the staunchest advocates of abortion rights, pragmatism seems to be carrying the day. After two major defeats in Supreme Court nomination battles, a new wave of restrictive state laws in South Dakota and elsewhere, and a sense that Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision declaring a constitutional right to abortion, could be hanging on the next vacancy, many say they simply cannot afford to do anything that jeopardizes Democrats' chances of retaking the Senate.
 Kate Michelman, the former president of Naral Pro-Choice America, said she had seriously considered an independent candidacy for the Senate, outraged over Mr. Casey's support for the Alito nomination. But she decided against it, she said, because she did not want to contribute to the re-election of Mr. Santorum. When she discussed her rationale for not running at a recent speech before a gathering of Planned Parenthood supporters in central Pennsylvania, they burst into applause.
 Some Democrats note that their party has always had some opponents of abortion rights in their ranks. Mr. Casey's father, the former governor, famously feuded with his national party over the abortion issue in the early 1990's. And over the years, both Congressional parties have polarized on the issue; when the Senate voted in 2003 on a resolution expressing support for Roe v. Wade, only 5 of the 48 Democrats voted against it, and two of them are now gone. Only nine Republicans voted for it.
 Against that overriding political reality, what message would Mr. Casey send if he is successful this November? Paul Begala, a longtime Democratic strategist and friend of the Casey family, said Mr. Casey's rise would signal that opposition to abortion rights was not like opposition to civil rights.
 ''Can you be a good Democrat and be pro-life? Yes,'' Mr. Begala said.
 But some abortion rights leaders beg to differ. Kim Gandy, president of NOW, said: ''It's not 'like' civil rights. It is civil rights.'' Ms. Gandy added that she believed the recruitment of Mr. Casey was a poor strategy, but added, ''What concerns me is if they win in spite of their bad strategy, they'll get the idea that it was a good strategy they should replicate.''

HEADLINE: Making Friends Was Easy. Big Profit Is Tougher.

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL

DATELINE: SANTA MONICA, Calif. 

 BODY:
ALMOST on a lark, Chris DeWolfe bought the Internet address MySpace.com in 2002, figuring that it might be useful someday. At first, he used the site to peddle a motorized contraption, made in China and called an E-scooter, for $99. 
 Selling products online comes naturally to him. Having jumped into the Internet business in the early days, Mr. DeWolfe had become a master of the aggressive forms of online marketing, including e-mail messages and pop-up advertising. After the Internet bubble burst, he even built a site that let people download computer cursors in the form of waving flags; the trick was that they also downloaded software that would monitor their Internet movements and show them pop-up ads.
Very quickly, however, Mr. DeWolfe's tactics for MySpace changed. He had noticed the popularity of Friendster, a rapidly growing Web site that let people communicate with their friends and meet the friends of their friends. What would happen, he wondered, if he combined this type of social networking with the sort of personal expression enabled by other sites for creating Web pages or online journals? 
 He convinced the executives of eUniverse, the company that had bought his own marketing firm, ResponseBase, to back his plan. As soon as the site was reintroduced, in the summer of 2003, Mr. DeWolfe saw it grow quickly with little marketing. And although his scrappy backer was hungry for cash, he resisted pressure to flood MySpace with advertising and to turn all of its members into money.
 ''Chris came from ResponseBase, and they knew all the direct marketing tactics to get money out of almost anything,'' said Brett C. Brewer, the former president of eUniverse, which was later renamed Intermix Media. ''But I give him credit: from literally the first or second month, he realized MySpace could be something we really need to protect because user confidence in the site was paramount.''
 Now MySpace has a new owner -- Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, which bought MySpace and Intermix last year for $649 million -- and the pressure on Mr. DeWolfe to find a way to make much more money from MySpace is far greater.
 But the opportunity is greater, too. More than 70 million members have signed up -- more than twice as many as MySpace had when Mr. Murdoch agreed to buy it -- drawn by a simple format that lets users build their own profile pages and link to the pages of their friends. It has tapped into three passions of young people: expressing themselves, interacting with friends and consuming popular culture.
 MySpace now displays more pages each month than any other Web site except Yahoo. More pages, of course, means more room for ads. And, in theory, those ads can be narrowly focused on each member's personal passions, which they conveniently display on their profiles. As an added bonus for advertisers, the music, photos and video clips that members place on their profiles constitutes a real-time barometer of what is hot.
 FOR now, MySpace is charging bargain-basement rates to attract enough advertisers for the nearly one billion pages it displays each day. The company will have revenue of about $200 million this year, estimated Richard Greenfield of Pali Capital, a brokerage firm in New York. That is less than one-twentieth of Yahoo's revenue.
 In buying MySpace, Mr. Murdoch also bought a tantalizing problem: how to tame a vast sea of fickle and unruly teenagers and college students just enough to notice advertising or to buy things, yet not make the site so commercial that he scares off his audience. At the same time, he must address the real and growing concerns of parents and teachers who see MySpace as a den of youthful excess and, potentially, as a lure for sexual predators.
 Mr. Murdoch's initial strategy seems to be to do nothing to interfere with whatever alchemy attracted so many young people to MySpace in the first place. So he has embraced Mr. DeWolfe, 40, and Tom Anderson, 30, the company's president and co-founder, and their close-knit management team. And he is providing them with the cash to reinforce MySpace's shaky computer system and to hire armies of sales representatives to bring in more money from the banner ads and sponsored pages that MySpace sells.
 He also gave them multimillion-dollar bonus payments to smooth the feelings that were ruffled when Intermix was sold, dragging MySpace along with it against the will of its founders, who received only a small portion of the sale price.
 Still, change is coming. In Beverly Hills, nine miles and worlds away from MySpace's beachside office, the News Corporation is assembling its overarching online unit, Fox Interactive Media. Run by Ross Levinsohn, the longtime manager of FoxSports.com, Fox Interactive Media is stitching together several Web properties into a big Internet company focused on youth. The top priority is MySpace.
 ''We have some very aggressive goals on how to build this thing into a real contributor to News Corp. financially,'' Mr. Levinsohn said last month. Mr. Murdoch, he added, ''is focused on that, and he rightfully holds my feet to the fire.''
 To expand ad sales, especially to big brands, Mr. Levinsohn plans to supplement the MySpace staff with a second sales force linked to the Fox TV sales department. He wants to expand one of Mr. DeWolfe's advertising ideas -- turning advertisers into members of the MySpace community, with their own profiles, like the teenagers' -- so that the young people who often spend hours each day on MySpace can become ''friends'' with movies, cellphone companies and even deodorants. Young people can link to the profiles set up for these goods and services, as they would to real friends, and these commercial ''friends'' can even send them messages -- ads, really, but of a whole new kind. 
 Mr. Levinsohn is also developing plans for MySpace to be paid by some of the bands and video producers whose songs and short films are woven into its gaudy profiles like so many electronic stickers on a high-school locker. And he sees a chance for MySpace to rival eBay and Craigslist as a place where nearly anything is bought and sold.
 Mr. Greenfield, the Pali Capital analyst, says that these moves have potential -- especially if MySpace can convince members to put clips from Fox movies, television programs and other youth-oriented ''content'' on their profile pages. ''I don't know how big a business this can be, but it can clearly be a lot bigger than it is today,'' he said. ''The question is: Can you take it to the next level by making a business that leverages all the consumers who are telling you what they want to do?''
 Another question is this: Can the News Corporation achieve these goals if the executives in charge don't agree on how to do so, or even on whether they want to? Mr. Levinsohn, for example, said he saw opportunity in the one million bands that have established profiles on MySpace; he said MySpace could charge bands to promote concerts or to sell their songs directly through the site.
 In an interview the next day, however, Mr. DeWolfe dismissed the idea. ''Music brings a lot of traffic into MySpace,'' he said, ''and it lets us sell very large sponsorships to those brands that want to reach consumers who are interested in music. We never thought charging bands was a viable business model.''
 Mr. Levinsohn brushed aside the discord, saying it was appropriate for the people running MySpace to be more concerned at this point about serving users than making money. And, for now, Mr. DeWolfe and Mr. Anderson say they are happy working for the News Corporation and Mr. Murdoch, its 75-year-old chairman and chief executive. ''Rupert Murdoch blew me away,'' Mr. DeWolfe said. ''He really understands what youth is doing today.''
 BY many accounts, the MySpace culture reflects the style of Mr. DeWolfe, who has a hard-nosed business approach under a laid-back exterior. ''Chris is a very strong personality,'' said Geoff Yang, a partner in Redpoint Ventures, which invested in MySpace last year as part of an effort to separate it from Intermix; the News Corporation's acquisition of Intermix thwarted that effort. ''He will listen to a lot of ideas, make up his mind and be laser-focused to get a few of them done.''
 Mr. DeWolfe, who focuses on business affairs, and Mr. Anderson, who designs features for the site, have deliberately kept MySpace rudimentary, with an almost homemade feeling, to give the most flexibility to users. In spirit, the site reflects its Southern Californian home with all of its idiosyncratic performers, designers, demicelebrities and other cultural hustlers, many of whom the founders recruited to be early members. Mr. DeWolfe, in particular, is a fan of Los Angeles nightlife and has become something of a public figure himself.
 ''Chris has become this living persona of MySpace,'' said Mr. Brewer, who recalled a trip to Aspen, Colo., with Mr. Anderson and Mr. DeWolfe last December. ''Chris is wearing an awesome leather jacket, some sort of designer shirt, with his hair all over the place. He has this whole rock-star persona. And you hear people going: 'Psst, psst. That's the MySpace guy.' ''
 When he is not basking in the MySpace spotlight himself, Mr. DeWolfe has begun using it to promote music events around the country. MySpace members can become ''friends'' with a profile for ''MySpace Secret Shows,'' for instance, and they will receive tips about free concerts -- sponsored by companies like Tower Records -- in their hometowns.
 On a recent Friday in Manhattan, several hundred people trekked through drizzling rain to the Tower Records store in the East Village for free tickets to a concert by Franz Ferdinand, the Scottish postpunk band, at the Hammerstein Ballroom.
 Heather Candella, a college student from Sloatsburg, N.Y., was among those at the show. She said the shows were ''a really good idea because it's kind of a secret kind of thing -- it's not so commercial.''
 She added that MySpace had become a main way to stay in touch with her friends. While she does not use the site to meet people, it has become part of the dating ritual. ''When you meet someone, the question is not 'What's your number?' '' she said. ''It's 'What's your MySpace?' ''
 By checking out a guy's profile, she said, ''you can actually get a feeling for who they are.''
 MySpace users pepper their profiles with their own photographs, musings and poetry, and with their favorite music and video clips. That maximizes the individuality of each profile but turns the typical media-company business model upside down, which is one reason that it is so hard for the News Corporation to use the audience to sell ads or to promote its own programming. The best way to get, say, a television show in front of the MySpace audience is not to cut a deal with a programming czar at a Hollywood restaurant, but to win the hearts, one by one, of thousands of members who will display the show to all of their friends.
 ''We can't look at this as a media property,'' said Peter Chernin, the News Corporation's president. ''This is a site programmed by its users.''
 For that reason, MySpace is only gingerly pushing users into other Fox properties. Right now, Fox's relationship to MySpace is not explicit, although Fox movies and television shows are frequent advertisers. Ultimately, the News Corporation will make it easy for MySpace members to put clips from its television programs and trailers for its movies on their profile pages. But there will be nothing to stop them from using material from other companies. 
 Mr. Levinsohn calls MySpace the antiportal. ''It's not about a central hub, because that's not where things are going,'' he said. ''The under-30 set wants choice. It's not about one destination; it's about 65 million.''
 Indeed, rather than squeeze all its Internet ambitions into MySpace, Fox Interactive is assembling a network of Web sites, including IGN, a collection of sites focused on video games, and Scout, which runs Web sites for about 200 local sports teams. The News Corporation is also developing a portal devoted to entertainment, drawing from its Fox network programs, the Page Six gossip column of The New York Post and show-business reporters at the 35 local television stations it owns, Mr. Levinsohn said.
 AT MySpace, the first challenge is to raise advertising rates. Because its supply of pages so greatly outstrips demand from advertisers, it has offered deep discounts. Indeed, the average rate paid for advertising is a bit over a dime for 1,000 impressions, Mr. Levinsohn said, far lower than rates at major competitors. ''If we can raise that by 10 cents, think of the upside,'' he said.
 One way to coax more money from advertisers is to build special sections -- areas devoted to music and independent filmmakers -- that provide a neutral home to advertisers that want MySpace's youthful audience but don't want their ads associated with the risque content of some members' profiles.
 A sign of that challenge is seen in Mr. Levinsohn's effort to expand the use of text ads -- the rapidly growing format pioneered by search engines. He has been running tests with Yahoo, Google and several smaller ad providers and has sought proposals from them for longer-term deals.
 The answer he received was a shock. Not one of them, not even the mighty Google, was sure that it could provide enough advertisements to fill all the pages that MySpace displays each day, Mr. Levinsohn said. The search companies did not want to dilute their networks with so many ads for MySpace users, whom they said were not the best prospects for most marketing because they use MySpace for socializing, not buying.
 Mr. Levinsohn says he also hopes to raise ad rates by collecting more user data so advertisers can find the most promising prospects. To use the site, people need to provide their age, location and sex, and often volunteer their sexual orientation and personal interests. Some of that information is already being used to select ads to display. Soon, the site will track when users visit profile pages and other sections devoted to topics of interest to advertisers. People who put information about sports cars in their profiles or who frequent MySpace message boards about hot-rodding, for example, would be shown ads for car parts, even while reading messages from friends. 
 The bigger opportunity, however, is not so much selling banner ads, but finding ways to integrate advertisers into the site's web of relationships. Wendy's Old Fashioned Hamburgers, for example, created a profile for the animated square hamburger character from its television campaign. About 100,000 people signed up to be ''friends'' with the square.
 Fox officials wonder whether this sort of commerce, built on relationships, can be extended to small businesses. A Ford dealership in, say, Indiana could create a profile, said Mark A. Jung, the chief operating officer of Fox Interactive. The profiles themselves, he said, would probably be free, but MySpace would sell enhancements to help businesses attract customers and complete transactions, Mr. Jung said. 
 Yet here is another place that executives at Fox and MySpace don't see eye to eye. Mr. DeWolfe discounted the idea of people creating profile pages for small businesses. ''If it was a really commercial profile -- the gas station down the street -- no one is going to sign up to be one of their friends,'' he said. ''There is nothing interesting about it.''
 For now, Mr. DeWolfe said, he has more down-to-earth plans. With the News Corporation's help, he is opening an office in London to coordinate MySpace's expansion in Europe. He is cutting deals to let members connect to MySpace over cellphones.
 The News Corporation, he said, is helping MySpace achieve his goals sooner than it could on its own. So far this year, MySpace has spent $20 million of the News Corporation's money, in part to nearly double its staff of 250. About one-third of its employees focus on customer service and, increasingly, on responding to parents' concerns about what teenagers do on the site and what else they can see there. In the last six months, there has been a torrent of letters from schools to parents -- as well as newspaper articles -- about the glorification of drinking, drug use and sex on many MySpace profiles.
 MySpace has long had rules that forbid anyone under 14 to join and that ban pornographic images and hate speech. Beyond those, however, the site is very open to frank discussion, provocative images and links to all sorts of activities. It didn't stop Playboy magazine, for example, from creating a profile page on its site to recruit members to pose in the magazine. Nor does it object to Jenna Jameson, the pornographic film star, maintaining a profile with links to her hard-core Web site.
 Ms. Jameson ''is more than a porn star,'' Mr. Anderson said. ''She is an author and a celebrity and has been on Oprah.'' He added that ''if we had a site that was 'My name is so-and-so and this is my porn site,' we would delete that.''
 Mr. Levinsohn, Mr. DeWolfe and others at the News Corporation say the site has no more or fewer problems than any other community on the Internet, and their primary response to parents' concern is a campaign to educate users about safe surfing techniques. ''There are a couple of basic safety tips that can make MySpace safe for anyone over 14,'' Mr. DeWolfe said. ''Just like you tell kids not to get in the car with strangers and to look both ways before you cross the street.''
 A sign that MySpace can play a role in some of the most distressing experiences of growing up came last week, when five teenage boys were arrested in Riverton, Kan. Law enforcement and school officials there said that the group planned to go on a shooting spree at their high school but were stopped after one of them discussed the plot on MySpace.
 IN some ways, MySpace has assumed the role America Online held a decade ago when it introduced e-mail services and Internet chat to the masses. But AOL's example is a cautionary one. For many reasons, largely its failure to keep up with trends, AOL lost its place in the social lives of young people.
 Mr. DeWolfe argues that MySpace won't suffer that fate because, in just two years, it has already become so entrenched in so many lives. ''People are truly invested in the site,'' he said. ''All their friends are on it. They spent months building their profiles. And so the cost of switching is too high. If we keep building the features they want, they will stay on the site.''
 If he is right, MySpace will be more than just a trendy toy to be discarded like last year's E-scooter.

HEADLINE: How a Billionaire Friend of Bill Helps Him Do Good, and Well

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER and PATRICK HEALY; Clifford J. Levy contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
After leaving the White House in 2001, former President Bill Clinton was inundated with business and job offers, from investment-bank partnerships to seats on corporate boards. He turned them all down, with one exception: He agreed to be an adviser to a family of funds run by the Yucaipa Companies, a California private equity firm controlled by one of his best friends, the billionaire Ronald W. Burkle.
 Mr. Clinton's arrangement with Mr. Burkle is an unusual one for a former president, giving him the potential to make tens of millions of dollars without great effort and at virtually no risk, according to Mr. Burkle and advisers to Mr. Clinton.
Mr. Clinton's role is to help find investment opportunities for Yucaipa projects, give credibility to the funds and champion their mission of investing in poor areas to corporate executives, union leaders and others. But he has put up little of his own money and has no day-to-day responsibilities over how the more than $1 billion in the funds is invested. 
 Mr. Clinton, 59, spends most of his time on philanthropic ventures, like fighting AIDS in Africa and poverty around the world, and minimal time on Yucaipa, his advisers say. Mr. Burkle, 53, who made his fortune operating supermarkets, said that the time Mr. Clinton does spend on the funds is invaluable because of the incomparable access and political star power he provides.
 Mr. Burkle said that Mr. Clinton had spoken with the chairmen of McDonald's and Boeing about possible projects that Yucaipa might have invested in, though those projects did not come to fruition.
 The relationship brings together two outsize personalities who rose from modest beginnings to inhabit the glamorous heights of the political and financial worlds. The chubby young boy from Hope, Ark., and the grocery bag boy from Yucaipa, Calif., are now joined in a partnership that commands audiences of heads of state, business potentates and movie stars wherever they go in Mr. Burkle's Boeing 757. 
 It is a bond that is drawing news media attention, too, because of Mr. Burkle's allegations that a contributor to The New York Post, Jared Paul Stern, tried to extort $220,000 from him in exchange for keeping false stories about him out of the Post's gossip column, called Page Six.
 Mr. Burkle, who by numerous accounts is devoted to Mr. Clinton, had become furious with gossip in The Post about them, like one story that suggested that Mr. Burkle was interested in buying a modeling agency for Mr. Clinton to run. Mr. Burkle and Clinton advisers said the two men never discussed that story or the claim of extortion, which remains under investigation. Mr. Stern has denied the allegations and says he was set up.
 Interviews with Mr. Burkle and aides to Mr. Clinton have provided the first details of the business relationship between the former president and Mr. Burkle, a major Democratic donor who is now a fund-raising force for Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton. He served as host for a fund-raiser for Mrs. Clinton at his Beverly Hills estate on Friday night.
 The three Yucaipa funds that Mr. Clinton advises total more than $1 billion, according to interviews and public records. Mr. Burkle would not disclose the precise amounts, citing competitive concerns, but Yucaipa manages in excess of $3 billion, of which these three funds are a subset. The funds are intended to inject investment capital into poor urban and rural areas in the United States and abroad that traditional equity funds and banks are reluctant to serve, Mr. Burkle said.
 The funds Mr. Clinton advises invest in grocery stores, retail developments, manufacturing and distribution, and minority-owned businesses. Yucaipa has found significant growth opportunities in such areas because of the low cost of land and the relative lack of competition.
 Under terms described by Clinton advisers and Mr. Burkle, Mr. Clinton will receive a share of Mr. Burkle's profits on two domestic funds should their returns exceed 9 percent over the life of the funds. One fund had reported a gain of 51.3 percent and the other 25.8 percent in 2005, according to reports to investors.
 Mr. Clinton is also a partner in a Yucaipa fund that invests in overseas ventures, for which he receives regular payments and would draw one-third of the profits when the fund is dissolved at least five years from now.
 ''If we make money, he makes money,'' Mr. Burkle said. He would not be more specific about Mr. Clinton's compensation. But if the funds perform as well as Mr. Burkle's other investment funds have over the past two decades, Mr. Clinton's share of the profits could reach into the tens of millions of dollars.
 While the business activities of ex-presidents are not always in public view, they are known to have pursued a variety of profit-making and charitable activities after leaving office. George H. W. Bush became a paid adviser to the Carlyle Group, a private investment house in Washington that does a lot of business with the Pentagon and other federal agencies. 
 Ronald Reagan received $2 million for a speech in Japan, but spent most of his post-presidency at home with Alzheimer's disease. Jimmy Carter has written many books and devoted himself to philanthropic pursuits like Habitat for Humanity. 
 Gerald R. Ford has been paid for speaking to groups but has generally kept a low profile. Richard Nixon wrote books and tried to rehabilitate his image.
 The Clintons have a somewhat checkered history of investing with personal associates. An investment in the failed Arkansas real estate deal known as Whitewater led to a government investigation that nearly brought down Mr. Clinton's presidency and left the couple with millions of dollars in legal bills. During their time in Arkansas, a friend advised Mrs. Clinton in the investment of $1,000 in the cattle futures market that yielded a quick $100,000 in profit; the investment prompted questions about political favoritism once the Clintons moved to the White House.
 The Clintons' chief source of income since leaving the White House has been lucrative book contracts and scores of six-figure speaking engagements for the ex-president.
 The California Public Employees Retirement System, often called Calpers, is a major investor in the two domestic funds of Yucaipa,, committing $400 million since 2002 with an option to invest another $275 million, according to public records. Calpers officials said they chose to invest with Yucaipa because it has a stellar track record and it invests in communities that have trouble attracting other investment capital. 
 In announcing its decision in 2002, Calpers said that the firm had generated an internal rate of return of 45 percent annually on $14.6 billion in investments over the previous 16 years.
 Mr. Burkle said it is impossible to put a dollar figure on the value that Mr. Clinton brings to his ventures. ''He explains to people better than we can why these are good things to invest in,'' Mr. Burkle said in an interview on Thursday night in Mr. Clinton's Harlem office. ''He'll talk about the importance to the economy, to the community. And he builds the brand of Yucaipa.''
 Mr. Clinton was not at the office during the interview. Some of Mr. Clinton's aides were granted anonymity to provide details about the business relationship with Mr. Burkle that are not otherwise publicly available.
 In a speech to a teachers' retirement fund group in 2003, Mr. Clinton explained the attraction of working with Mr. Burkle. He said that he had many offers to go into business after he left the White House, but he turned them all down except the one proposed by Mr. Burkle. He explained that the Yucaipa Companies had '' earned a phenomenal return investing in three things I care about: in underserved communities, in underperforming companies that are friendly to their workers and their families, and in minority-owned businesses.''
 Mr. Burkle said of his business philosophy: ''You don't have to be smart. You just have to know enough to call someone who is smart.''
 The two men first met when Mr. Clinton was running for president in 1992 and touring neighborhoods in Los Angeles that had been torched during riots after the acquittal of several police officers charged with beating Rodney King. Mr. Clinton noticed that some supermarkets were still open, and asked why, his aides recalled. He was told that those stores were not burned because the owner, Mr. Burkle, treated his customers and employees fairly. Mr. Clinton asked to meet him.
 A meeting was quickly set up at the Burbank airport with Mr. Burkle, then a registered Republican, who ran an empire of California supermarkets. The two men drove to a political event, then kept talking in the car for 45 minutes. Mr. Burkle said he came away in awe; he cast his first vote for a Democrat, Mr. Clinton, that fall.
 Their relationship grew during his presidency, when Mr. Clinton was a frequent overnight guest at Mr. Burkle's Beverly Hills estate, Greenacres, the former home of Harold Lloyd, the silent screen star. 
 Mr. Burkle contributed millions of dollars to Mr. Clinton's campaigns and to the Democratic Party and has been a significant benefactor of the Clinton Library in Little Rock, Ark. He also helped pay part of the more than $11 million in legal bills Mr. Clinton accrued during the Whitewater and Monica Lewinsky investigations. Mr. Burkle was among the dozens of Democratic donors rewarded with a stay in the Lincoln Bedroom in the White House.
 Now, Mr. Burkle says, that he and Mr. Clinton spend about 500 hours a year together, traveling the world aboard Mr. Burkle's plane to attend conferences and meetings with foreign leaders.
 Mr. Burkle has been estranged from his ex-wife, Janet, since 1992. They are still battling in court over the financial terms of her settlement.
 As the two men grew closer when Mr. Clinton was in office, there was at least one instance when the relationship touched on presidential authority: A potential pardon for Michael Milken, the former junk-bond baron who is a friend of Mr. Burkle's, as Mr. Clinton was leaving office in 2001.
 In the interview, Mr. Burkle disputed newspaper accounts that he had directly asked Mr. Clinton to pardon Mr. Milken, who was convicted of securities fraud, and had offered a large contribution to the Clinton presidential library as an inducement. He said the he and Mr. Clinton had a late-night discussion about limitations on convicted felons voting or traveling overseas. 
 Mr. Burkle said he was troubled that Mr. Milken had been unable to take his family to the 2000 Olympics in Australia because of restrictions imposed on him as a condition of his parole. He said that Mr. Clinton noted that this was the kind of case the presidential pardon system was designed for and that it was relatively easy to apply.
 Mr. Clinton ultimately declined to grant Mr. Milken a pardon, after Department of Justice and White House political aides warned that it would touch off a firestorm, as several of the pardons he ultimately granted did. Mr. Burkle said that Mr. Clinton called him personally to tell him he was rejecting Mr. Milken's pardon plea.

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Sunday about former President Bill Clinton's friendship with Ronald Burkle, the California financier and grocery chain operator, referred incompletely to the fate of Mr. Burkle's supermarkets during the Los Angeles riots of 1992 (an event that led Mr. Clinton to seek out the businessman after being told that rioters had spared some of his markets because of his reputation for fairness). Although some of Mr. Burkle's markets were spared, others were burned or otherwise damaged by rioters.

HEADLINE: At Los Angeles Times, a Columnist Who Used a False Web Name Loses His Blog

BYLINE: By KATIE HAFNER

 BODY:
In the last few years, newspapers around the country have been testing the waters of the seldom-restrained, often scrappy world of Web-based journalism by setting their reporters loose to write their own blogs. 
 Last week, the experiment backfired for The Los Angeles Times. The newspaper suspended the blog of one of its columnists after it was revealed that he had posted comments on the paper's Web site and elsewhere on the Web under false names.
Michael A. Hiltzik, 53, a business columnist and a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter for the paper, acknowledged using the names Mikekoshi and Nofanofcablecos not only in posts to his own blog, but on other Web sites as well. 
 In a statement on Mr. Hiltzik's blog and printed in the paper last week, The Los Angeles Times said Mr. Hiltzik's actions had violated the newspaper's ethics guidelines, ''which requires editors and reporters to identify themselves when dealing with the public.'' That policy ''applies to both the print and online editions of the newspaper.'' 
 The incident has underscored the difficulties that can arise when a newspaper gives free rein to staff writers on the Web. ''You give up a lot of control. It requires an enormous amount of trust,'' said Mickey Kaus, a columnist for Slate.com. 
 Mr. Hiltzik's reputation at The Times is mixed. In 1993, while serving as a correspondent in Moscow, he was recalled to Los Angeles after it was discovered he had been reading his colleagues' e-mail messages. Six years later, he and a fellow Times writer, Chuck Philips, received a Pulitzer Prize for a series of articles on corruption in the entertainment industry.
 Mr. Hiltzik has been writing his Golden State blog, which carries the same name as his newspaper column, since last fall. As a blogger, Mr. Hiltzik is often strident in his liberal views, and has engaged in public political scrapes with a number of conservative bloggers. 
 It was one such blogger, Patrick Frey, who exposed Mr. Hiltzik's anonymous postings. Mr. Frey, an assistant Los Angeles district attorney, maintains a conservative blog called Patterico's Pontifications. Last week, Mr. Frey wrote on his blog that Mr. Hiltzik had been posting to Web sites pseudonymously for two or three years. Shortly thereafter, The Times suspended the Golden State blog. 
 In an e-mail exchange for this article, Mr. Hiltzik declined to comment on his actions, as did officials at The Times.
 ''We're still investigating the matter and will not comment further until we've completed that process,'' said Amy Moynihan, a spokeswoman for the paper, in an e-mail message. 
 The incident has also called into question a newspaper's ability to enforce its own ethics policies. 
 ''I'm all for ethics,'' said Jack Shafer, the media critic at Slate.com, ''but the newspaper wants its writers to always identify themselves when operating in the public sphere. I can understand that, but good luck enforcing a policy like that in the Internet era. There are just too many places to hide now.'' 
 John Robinson, the editor of The News & Record in Greensboro, N.C., who writes a blog for the paper, said that while the temptation to cloak one's identity may be stronger on the Web, ''you really expect your staff to maintain their integrity, and part of that is to be who you say you are.'' Mr. Hiltzik's anonymous posting was ''just a dumb thing to do,'' Mr. Robinson added.
 Mr. Hiltzik remains employed at the paper and is continuing to write his print column, which appears twice a week. The print column is overseen by an editor, but the Golden State blog was not. 
 Mr. Hiltzik himself has written about the problematic nature of newspaper-sponsored blogs. 
 ''Can a company that derives economic value from its reputation for literacy, judiciousness and taste comfortably lend its imprimatur to an unfiltered online diary?'' Mr. Hiltzik wrote in his print column and on the Golden State blog last October. ''Blogs are by nature almost impossible to censor.'' 
 Mr. Hiltzik continued, ''How these experiments will work out is anyone's guess. Anything may happen.''

HEADLINE: CSI: Trade Deficit

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Forensics are in. If you turn on the TV during prime time, you're likely to find yourself watching people sorting through clues from a crime scene, trying to figure out what really happened.
 That's more or less what's going on right now among international finance experts. The crime in question is the U.S. trade deficit, which according to the broadest measure reached an amazing $805 billion last year. The mystery is how we've been able to run huge deficits, year after year, with so few visible adverse consequences. And the future of the U.S. economy depends on which of two proposed solutions to the mystery is right.
Here's the puzzle: the trade deficit means that America is living beyond its means, spending far more than it earns. (In 2005, the United States exported only 53 cents' worth of goods for every dollar it spent on imports.) To pay for the excess of imports over exports, the United States has to sell stocks, bonds and businesses to foreigners. In fact, we've borrowed more than $3 trillion just since 1999. 
 By rights, then, the investment income -- interest payments, stock dividends and so on -- that Americans pay to foreigners should be a lot larger than the investment income foreigners pay to Americans. But according to official statistics, the United States still has a slightly positive balance on investment income.
 How is this possible? The answer, almost certainly, is that there's something wrong with the numbers. (Laypeople tend to treat official statistics as gospel; professional economists know that putting these numbers together involves a lot of educated guesswork -- and sometimes the guesses are wrong.) But depending on exactly what's wrong, the U.S. economy either has hidden strengths, or it's in even worse shape than it seems.
 In one corner are economists who think the official statistics miss invisible U.S. exports -- exports not of goods and services, but of intangibles like knowledge and brand-name recognition, which allow U.S. companies to earn high rates of return on their foreign investments. Proponents of this view claim that if we counted these invisible exports, which they call ''dark matter,'' much of the U.S. trade deficit would disappear. 
 The dark matter hypothesis has been eagerly taken up by some journalists, who like its upbeat message. It seems to say that the U.S. economy is, as a cover article in Business Week put it, ''much stronger than you think.'' 
 But there's a problem: U.S. companies operating abroad don't, in fact, seem to earn especially high rates of return. Why, then, doesn't the United States seem to be paying a price for all its borrowing? Because according to the official data, foreign companies operating in the United States are remarkably unprofitable, earning an average return of only 2.2 percent a year.
 There's something wrong with this picture. As Daniel Gros of the Center for European Policy Studies puts it, it's hard to believe that foreigners would continue investing in the United States ''if they were really being constantly taken to the cleaners.''
 In a new paper, Mr. Gros argues -- compellingly, in my view -- that what's really happening is that foreign companies are understating the profits of their U.S. subsidiaries, probably to avoid taxes, and that official data are, in particular, failing to pick up foreign profits that are reinvested in U.S. operations. 
 If Mr. Gros is right, the true position of the U.S. economy isn't as bad as you think -- it's worse. The true trade deficit, including unreported profits that accrue to foreign companies, isn't $800 billion -- it's more than $900 billion. And America's foreign debt, including the value of foreign-owned businesses, is at least $1 trillion bigger than the official numbers say. 
 Of course, optimists have a comeback: if things are really that bad, why are so many foreign investors still buying U.S. bonds? And they point out that those predicting problems from the trade deficit have been wrong so far. But I have two words for those who place their faith in the judgment of investors, and believe that a few good years are enough to prove the skeptics wrong: Nasdaq 5,000.
 Right now, forensic analysis seems to say that the U.S. trade position is worse, not better, than it looks. And the answer to the question, ''Why haven't we paid a price for our trade deficit?'' is, just you wait.

HEADLINE: A Religious Push Against Gay Unions

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 23 

 BODY:
About 50 prominent religious leaders, including seven Roman Catholic cardinals and about a half-dozen archbishops, have signed a petition in support of a constitutional amendment blocking same-sex marriage.
 Organizers of the petition said it was in part an effort to revive the groundswell of opposition to same-sex marriage that helped bring many conservative voters to the polls in some pivotal states in 2004. The signers include many influential evangelical Protestants, a few rabbis and an official of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
But both the organizers and gay rights groups said what was striking about the petition was the direct involvement by high-ranking Roman Catholic officials, including 16 bishops. Although the church has long opposed same-sex unions, and the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops had previously endorsed the idea of a constitutional amendment banning such unions, it was evangelical Protestants who generally led the charge when the amendment was debated in 2004. 
 ''The personal involvement of bishops and cardinals is significantly greater this time than in 2004,'' said Patrick Korten, a spokesman for the Knights of Columbus, a lay Catholic group. 
 The Catholic bishops and many of the other religious leaders involved have pledged to distribute postcards for their congregants to send to their senators urging support for the amendment. The Knights of Columbus is distributing 10 million postcards to Catholic churches.
 The petition drive was organized in part by Prof. Robert P. George of Princeton, a Catholic scholar with close ties to evangelical Protestant groups. Aides to three Republican senators -- Bill Frist of Tennessee, the Republican leader; Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania; and Sam Brownback of Kansas -- were also involved, organizers said.
 Archbishop John J. Myers of Newark said that at a meeting in Washington in February, the Senate aides recommended the idea of a postcard campaign, recalling the success of a similar effort that the bishops organized in support of a ban on so-called partial-birth abortion. 
 ''We think the American people are on our side on this, and we want the Senate to know it,'' the archbishop said. 
 The campaign comes as many in the Republican Party are increasingly worried that their core supporters may stay away from the polls this year because they are demoralized by the war in Iraq and other matters. Senate Republican leaders have scheduled a vote on the proposed amendment in June, partly as a means of rallying conservatives.
 No one expects the measure to pass this year. But drives to amend state constitutions to ban same sex-marriage proved powerful incentives to turning out conservative voters in Ohio and elsewhere in 2004. At least two states with contested Senate races -- Tennessee and Pennsylvania, where Mr. Santorum is seeking re-election against a Democrat who also opposes abortion rights -- are debating constitutional bans on same-sex marriage this year.
 But Ohio and other pivotal states have already amended their constitutions, and at least one poll suggests that the public's negative response to the first same-sex marriages is cooling. A Pew Research poll in March found that 51 percent of the public opposed legalizing same-sex marriage, down from 63 percent in February 2004. 
 Joe Solmonese, president of the Human Rights Campaign, a gay advocacy group, said supporters of the amendment were out of touch. ''We have a war raging in Iraq, we have a Gulf Coast that needs to be rebuilt, we have an economy barely hanging on,'' he said. ''The last thing America wants is this Republican-controlled Congress spending time writing discrimination into the Constitution.'' 
 Matt Daniels, founder of the Alliance for Marriage, an umbrella group that supports the proposed amendment, said the religious leaders represented ''huge numbers'' of people. His group has set up a Web site, religiouscoalitionformarriage.org that includes the petition, pew handouts and suggested notes for sermons.
 Organizers said the petition had brought together cardinals from both the left and right sides of the United States bishops' conference, including the liberal Cardinal Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles and the conservative Cardinal Francis George of Chicago, as well as Cardinals Edward M. Egan of New York, Theodore E. McCarrick of Washington, William H. Keeler of Baltimore and Sean Patrick O'Malley of Boston. 
 The prominent conservative Protestant figures included leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention, the largest Protestant denomination, as well as the president of conservative Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod and a handful of Episcopal Bishops. 
 Others included James C. Dobson of Focus on the Family; the evangelist D. James Kennedy; Bishop Charles E. Blake of the historically black Church of God in Christ; the Rev. Samuel Rodriguez Jr., president of the National Hispanic Association of Evangelicals. Rabbi Tzvi Hersh Weinreb of the Orthodox Union and officials of the Orthodox Church in America also signed. .

HEADLINE: Donor Nations to Focus on Growing States

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April. 23 

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, concluding their spring meetings on Sunday, have authorized plans to help them more fully recognize the expanding roles and challenges faced by developing nations. The fund will work toward giving countries with rapidly growing economies greater influence on its policies, while the bank hopes to help poor countries cope with global warming and the environmental and economic costs of quickly expanding energy needs.
 Finance ministers and central bank governors from the fund's 184 member countries on Saturday authorized the drafting of a proposal to increase the voting shares of a handful of countries that are most underrepresented relative to the size of their economies. They will most likely include China, South Korea, Mexico and Turkey. The plan will be presented at the next round of meetings, to be held in Singapore in September. 
More fairly reflecting the size of national economies through increased voting shares is important to retaining the institution's legitimacy as it advises governments on their economic policies, officials at the fund and analysts said.
 ''I have spoken several times about the need for increased voting power for some countries, including a number of emerging market economies, to ensure that they have a role in the fund's decision-making process that accords with their increased importance in the world economy,'' Rodrigo de Rato, the fund's managing director, said at a news conference on Saturday. He said he was satisfied that he now had ''a clear mandate to make some proposals.''
 But the fund left to a later day the broader and far more politically tricky task of fundamentally reapportioning the vote shares among countries to fully recognize their evolution within the global economy. Steven Radelet, an economist at the Center for Global Development, which studies issues affecting developing countries, said such a change would more clearly reflect the rise of Asian economies in recent decades, as well as Europe's reduced economic impact. 
 The United States endorsed both the interim step of increasing the vote share of some countries as well as the broader effort. The voting share of the United States, now 17 percent, is not expected to drop below the 15 percent share required to veto action by the fund, analysts said. ''Comprehensive, fundamental reform is needed if the I.M.F. is to remain legitimate and relevant to its membership,'' Treasury Secretary John W. Snow said in a statement. ''For this effort to succeed, members need to look beyond their immediate narrow interests.''
 The fund, which traditionally advises individual countries in the midst of economic crises and provides emergency loans to them, also hopes to expand its work. It would like to encourage cooperation between developing countries with rapid economic growth, like China and India, and the world's richest countries on issues that have global or regional ramifications. 
 Gordon Brown, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, said at a news conference on Saturday that the I.M.F. should ''monitor more deeply not just country policies but the linkages and spillover effects of one country's policies on others in the global economy.''
 At the World Bank, scientists discussed how to help developing countries reduce their emissions of the greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming, as well as how to deal with the consequences of climate change. Such changes will potentially have the most devastating consequences for the poorest people living near sea level, especially in Bangladesh and small island countries like the Maldives.
 Developing countries are hungry for more energy, and China and India in particular are rapidly expanding their energy production. Two-thirds of the increase in energy demand over the next 25 years will be in developing countries that are home to 1.6 billion people, mostly in Asia, said a newly released bank report, ''Clean Energy and Development: Towards an Investment Framework.'' The challenge will be to help them meet that need while minimizing environmental damage, bank researchers said.
 Rich nations and Russia are responsible for at least 70 percent of greenhouse gases, and developing countries that are expanding energy production to feed economic growth and reduce poverty say it is unfair to expect them to bear the financial burden of producing clean power, said Robert Watson, the bank's chief scientist. ''The developing countries say if you want us to be climate friendly, we have to be compensated for the additional costs,'' he said.
 The bank estimates it will cost $10 billion to $200 billion per year to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, depending on the rate of the reductions. To help meet those costs, bank officials authorized a proposal for accelerating investments in clean energy, to be drafted in the next five months.

HEADLINE: Senators to Reignite Debate on Immigration 

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE and SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 23 

 BODY:
Prodded by large demonstrations and the prospect of another on the horizon, Senate leaders will try to revive stalled immigration legislation this week, with some urging President Bush to mediate personally the sharp differences among Republicans on the volatile issue.
 Two weeks after the Senate walked away from its immigration debate, leaders of both parties are expressing a new sense of urgency to act before the November midterm elections. Mr. Bush, who has made an immigration bill a centerpiece of his legislative agenda and who could use a victory on Capitol Hill to revive his flagging second term, is expected to address the issue again on Monday in an appearance in Irvine, Calif. 
''This is a top priority, and the president wants to see the Congress press ahead and get something done, in a comprehensive way,'' the White House press secretary, Scott McClellan, told reporters on Sunday. 
 After an Easter recess punctuated by large immigrant rights protests, both Democrats and Republicans say their colleagues recognize that if they do not press ahead it could stir a reaction from those who want stricter border enforcement, business operators who rely on foreign workers and advocates of immigrant rights.
 ''We're not going to be stampeded, but at the same time we understand that there is a giant problem out there,'' said Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who set a hearing for Tuesday on the economic impact.
 Mr. Specter said he intended to use a White House meeting the same day to encourage Mr. Bush to ''get into the fray now'' by getting House and Senate Republicans to reconcile differences before the Senate passes a bill. ''The time has come for specifics,'' Mr. Specter said.
 Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader blamed by Republicans for tying up the legislation, and Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, a chief architect of the Senate measure that fell apart two weeks ago, also called on Mr. Bush to get involved. In interviews, each said the president must push back against conservatives who want to limit the legislation to stronger border enforcement.
 ''The president is going to have to weigh in on this,'' Mr. Reid said. ''Somebody has to stand up to the right wing that is not allowing us to go forward.''
 Mr. Bush has said he favors legislation that includes a guest worker program for illegal immigrants, and he used his radio address on Saturday to reiterate that goal. 
 A spokesman said the president was eager to work with Congressional leaders to advance a bill. ''The president's position is that it is important to keep that legislation moving,'' said Ken Lisaius, deputy White House press secretary.
 Mr. Bush has shown little appetite for the give and take of negotiations, preferring to outline his goals and leave details to his Congressional allies. But those allies are now feuding bitterly among themselves.
 Some Senate Republicans, led by John McCain of Arizona, champion an approach mixing stiffer border controls with potential citizenship for some illegal immigrants. But conservatives in the House and the Senate balk at talk of legal residency for those in the country illegally.
 ''The differences between the two approaches are so great, I do not know how you connect those dots,'' said Representative Tom Tancredo, Republican of Colorado, who favors more border enforcement. ''The idea of providing amnesty, which is inherent in every one of the Senate plans, is abhorrent to most members of the House Republican Conference.''
 Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, the majority leader, said Saturday in an article for National Review Online that he wanted to finish immigration legislation by the end of May. But he will face resistance from some in his own party.
 Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, said he was leery. ''We need to think very seriously about how we want immigration to be conducted in the future,'' Mr. Sessions said, citing estimates of 30 million new arrivals in the next decade. ''Just passing 'something' is not respectful of the American people.''
 Immigration will not be the first order of business for the Senate. Lawmakers will consider a $106.5 billion emergency spending measure for the war in Iraq and hurricane recovery, which will expose another Republican split over spending.
 That fight will push any immigration bill into the first week of May at the earliest. But trying to assuage conservatives and ease the way for a broader bill, Republicans want to add $2 billion to the emergency spending bill for additional border agents and enforcement tools like fences for high-traffic areas and new surveillance aircraft.
 ''Under any circumstances, security has to come first,'' Mr. Frist wrote in his article. 
 Mr. Reid, who two weeks ago resisted a Republican push for a series of conservative amendments to a bipartisan compromise on immigration, said in an interview that he was willing to agree to what he described as a reasonable number of them. But he said Mr. Frist, Mr. McCain and other Republican backers of a broad measure would eventually have to join Democrats in forcing a final vote if they wanted to produce a bill.
 Mr. Reid and Mr. Specter called for guarantees on how the Senate would conduct immigration talks with the House, including a commitment that senators would not give in to House conservatives.
 The Senate returns to its debate on the issue as immigrant advocacy groups plan an economic boycott on May 1, the latest in a series of large-scale demonstrations that have sharpened Congressional focus on the issue. Some lawmakers and members of the public have been upset at foreign flags at the rallies. Some predict that the proposed national school and job walkout could stir a stronger negative reaction.
 ''There is some real concern about the marches,'' said Representative Steve Chabot, an Ohio Republican who played host to Mr. McCain for a campaign event during the recess but does not share his position on immigration. ''For the most part, people think we ought to control our borders.''

HEADLINE: Eyes on November, Parties Zero In on Issues to Drive Voter Turnout

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: COLUMBIA, Mo., April 19 

 BODY:
Democrats are pressing their support for embryonic stem cell research in Congressional races around the country, seeking to move back to center stage an issue they believe resonates with voters and to exploit a division between conservatives who oppose the science and other Republicans more open to it.
 The question of whether the government should support or limit stem cell research has cropped up in Senate races in Maryland and Missouri, and in House races in California, Colorado, Illinois, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Washington and Wisconsin, especially in suburban swing districts.
''What Democrats want to do is gin up their turnout in the suburbs and divide Republicans, and right now they may do that,'' said Jennifer E. Duffy, who tracks Senate races for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. ''This is the first real wedge issue Democrats have had with Republicans.''
 The topic may not have the power of those frequently used by Republicans to rally their conservative base, like same-sex marriage and abortion. But it could help Democrats win voters who are pinning their hopes on the science for treatments and cures. 
 It may also influence voter turnout in some races, including here in Missouri, where a proposed constitutional amendment to protect stem cell research is making front-page news, and the incumbent Republican senator, Jim Talent, is facing a tough re-election challenge from the state auditor, Claire McCaskill, a Democrat.
 On Tuesday, Ms. McCaskill appeared in the central Missouri town of Fayette, population 2,793, for a wine-and-cheese reception at an antiques shop and, later, for a dinner of roast beef and potatoes in the brightly lit social hall of St. Joseph's, a Roman Catholic church. A Catholic church is hardly the kind of place where most politicians would talk up embryonic stem cell studies -- church leaders are fiercely opposed -- but Ms. McCaskill did just that.
 ''There are people of principle who disagree with this form of research,'' Ms. McCaskill told her audience. ''I respect their principles. But what I don't respect is someone dancing around science for political cover.''
 It was a pointed barb at Mr. Talent, a first-term Republican who has publicly wrestled with the stem cell issue and has avoided taking a stand on the proposed amendment. The initiative, destined for the November ballot if supporters gather enough signatures, is intended to beat back efforts to ban the research in Missouri. It would permit stem cell studies as long as they remain legal under federal law.
 With the Talent-McCaskill race too close to call, the initiative has thrust Mr. Talent into a treacherous Republican crosscurrent. On one side are Christian conservatives, who gave Mr. Talent their strong support when he ran for office in 2002 and are threatening not to vote unless he takes a stand on the amendment.
 On the other are business-minded Republicans, like Gov. Matt Blunt and John C. Danforth, a former United States senator, who back the initiative, saying the science holds promise not only for patients, but also for the economic health of the state. 
 Mr. Danforth, an Episcopal minister, and his brother, William, the chancellor emeritus of Washington University in St. Louis, have taken a prominent role in promoting the amendment.
 ''It's a hard issue for him,'' Mr. Danforth said, referring to Mr. Talent.
 Although scientists see hope in embryonic stem cell research for treatments and cures, opponents view the studies as immoral because the cells are extracted from human embryos. Research can be conducted freely with private money, but whether the government should pay for it has been a vexing question for Republicans.
 President Bush tackled the topic in August 2001 by imposing strict limits on taxpayer financing of embryonic stem cell research. He has vowed to veto any measure that would loosen those restrictions. But the House defied the president last year in voting to do just that.
 With the one-year anniversary of the House vote coming in May, backers of stem cell studies are planning a series of events intended to press the Senate majority leader, Bill Frist -- who has broken with the president to support the House bill -- into bringing the measure to a vote. 
 On Tuesday, the Coalition for the Advancement of Medical Research, an advocacy group, plans to have a researcher brief lawmakers in Washington on his work.
 Around the country, Democrats in seven House races are highlighting the stem cell issue with advertisements distributed by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. The advertisements spotlight Republicans like Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah and the former first lady Nancy Reagan who have been vocal supporters of the research.
 ''This is a personal issue because it holds out hope for a lot of people,'' said Ed Perlmutter, a Democrat running for Congress in suburban Denver. Mr. Perlmutter knows that firsthand: his daughter has epilepsy, and his in-laws have diabetes, disorders that may be helped by stem cell research.
 The stem cell issue has also figured in the Maryland Senate race. Democrats there seized on a statement by the Republican candidate, Lt. Gov. Michael Steele, who opposes the destruction of embryos for research. In February, Mr. Steele likened such studies to Nazi experiments in a speech before a Jewish group. The wife of a leading Democratic contender for Senate, Representative Benjamin L. Cardin, was in the audience, and Mr. Steele later apologized.
 But nowhere has the stem cell issue been more potent than here in the political bellwether state of Missouri, where Mr. Talent was elected to the Senate in 2002.
 Through a spokesman, the senator declined to be interviewed, saying he had already articulated his views in a lengthy Senate speech. In it, he focused on a type of study that involves obtaining stem cells by cloning human embryos, calling for a government competition to spur scientists to find alternative methods. 
 But Mr. Talent also took his name off a sweeping anti-cloning bill, saying he feared the measure might preclude those alternatives. Many Christian conservatives and Catholic leaders were outraged.
 ''Most pro-life voters just feel he's turned his back on them,'' said Larry Weber, executive director of the Missouri Catholic Conference, who opposes embryonic stem cell research.
 The big question in Missouri is whether those voters, who helped put Mr. Talent in office, will shun him now. Here in Columbia, a college town where life centers around the University of Missouri, Dennis Ballard, a patron at a downtown coffeehouse, said he wanted Mr. Talent to take a position on the ballot measure.
 ''I'll not vote for a Democrat,'' said Mr. Ballard, a retired medical administrator who voted for Mr. Talent in 2002. ''But I'll hold the option of staying home and not voting for a Republican who won't take a position.''
 John Hancock, a consultant to the Talent campaign, said he doubted such sentiment would affect the race. ''Senator Talent's very thoughtful position on stem cell, when it is clearly understood,'' Mr. Hancock said, ''is going to be very well received by all Missourians.''

HEADLINE: Anointed, Not Appointed

 BODY:
George W. Bush's high-handed attitude toward his own majority in Congress keeps getting worse, and we keep waiting for the Republicans to notice they are being insulted. 
 The latest case in point is President Bush's appointment last week of the next two public trustees for Social Security and Medicare. Normally, those positions require confirmation by the Senate. But leaders from both parties had made it clear they objected to the president's choices. Then the president did an end run, installing his candidates while Congress was in recess.
 It's not unheard of for a president to use a recess appointment to overcome stonewalling from his opposition. But in the past, such maneuvers have been treated by the White House as emergencies; this one seems to regard them as nothing unusual. 
 Social Security and Medicare are overseen by six trustees, four of them administration officials. The other two are supposed to represent the public. The terms of the last two public trustees -- Thomas Saving, an economist at Texas A&M, and John Palmer, former dean of the Maxwell School at Syracuse -- expired last spring. In November, Mr. Bush renominated the same two men to serve new four-year terms. Senators protested, maintaining that the point of having public trustees is to ensure that fresh outsiders' perspectives are represented on the board. 
 The senators are right, the president is wrong. With the four other administration trustees, the public trustees approve the assumptions that are used to project the financial health of Social Security and Medicare, as well as the text of the programs' annual reports. It sounds like a dry and pro forma job, but in fact, that information greatly influences policy. As the baby boom generation ages and as the Bush administration pursues an overall agenda of privatization, the need for public-interest representation grows only more acute. To quell politicization, the law wisely requires that the two public trustees come from different parties, and the Senate has never allowed any pair to serve repeated terms. 
 The White House says that it had to resort to recess appointments because it wanted public trustees in place to sign the 2006 annual reports for Social Security and Medicare, which were due on April 1. That's ludicrous. The two reappointed public trustees have not served as such during the past year, when the reports were being prepared. Their signatures would therefore be nothing but rubber stamps on administration documents.
 It is easy to understand why Mr. Bush would want the two trustees' imprimatur. His Social Security privatization plan was a colossal flop and the rollout of his Medicare drug benefit has been the target of widespread criticism. The public trustees' signatures would magnify any positive spin the reports manage to put on things. 
 Congress cannot undo the recess appointments. But the two newly re-upped public trustees can and should refuse them.

HEADLINE: Light and Space Reveal True Judd

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH

 BODY:
For the next two weeks, New York has something it may never have again: a small, unpretentious single-artist museum devoted to the achievements of the Minimalist sculptor Donald Judd. 
 This museum has been rather hastily assembled by an unlikely entity: Christie's New York. Its unlikely setting is two floors atop the Simon & Schuster Building, around the corner from the auction house at Rockefeller Center. The show is, in fact, the presale exhibition of 35 Judd works offered for sale by the Judd Foundation, established by the artist's estate in 1996, two years after his death. Everything on view is to be sold to the highest bidder on May 9, the final day of the show.
The works, which date from around 1970 to 1993, form a haphazard, partial and sometimes redundant survey of Judd's sculpture. They are clearly pieces that the foundation, which is in dire economic straits, has decided it can do without. 
 So I'm as surprised to be writing the following as you may be to read it: This exhibition is the most beautiful survey of Judd's work ever seen in New York, and the first to be displayed under conditions of space and light that the famously demanding artist might have found satisfactory. Christie's has made an unusual effort with this display, stripping the light-flooded space -- there are windows on four sides -- to its bare-bones cement surfaces. Judd's son, Flavin, who has some of his father's sense of proportion, had a role in planning both the raw-looking interior and the spare installation. And in the end the pieces work fairly well together, illustrating Judd's thinking about the box -- the basic of unit of his art -- as it moves between wall and floor, and from single-unit to multi-part pieces. 
 The conditions of the sale have been reported. Christie's is said to have guaranteed the foundation around $20 million, which it needs to pay off debts and establish an endowment; maintain the 16 buildings it owns in New York and in Marfa, Tex.; conserve the collections and library amassed by Judd; catalog his archives; and start converting his extensive unpublished writings into book form. His legacy, as complex physically as it is intellectually, is a national treasure that should be much more accessible to the public.
 It has been argued that this sale, in releasing so many works at one time, could deflate the Judd market and that a slower, private, more dignified weeding process would have permitted more pieces to be placed in public collections.
 Yet Judd might have viewed the sale with a certain pragmatic equanimity. I worked for him briefly in the early 1970's, mostly on his catalogue raisonne. He remarked more than once that one purpose of his smaller, portable sculptures was to make money to pay for larger projects.
 The foundation Judd mandated in his will is a very large project. He might even have liked the bold gesture of one big, widely publicized get-it-over-with auction. Besides, he famously hated museums, especially American ones. 
 Questions will always remain about whether the foundation exhausted all fund-raising possibilities before setting this course. And only time will tell if the influx of money can solve problems that may be more than simply financial. Adding peripheral heat to the discussion is the spectacle of Christie's promoting this presale show as the largest exhibition of Judd's work in this country since 1988, the year of his second retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art. First auction houses supersede galleries, then they move in on museums? Christie's has even provided an Acoustiguide.
 Christie's has indeed behaved like a museum -- or at least in a way more museums should act. Basically, it has put art before architecture in an uncluttered display that makes the work optimally visible. The presentation is undoubtedly a fantastic sales tool, but it is also a temporary gift to the city, one that every museum professional should see. 
 Judd went to Marfa because he found the conditions under which New York museums displayed contemporary art to be deplorable. His point remains a good one: art cannot be fully understood if it is not fully experienced. And if not fully experienced, it cannot meet one of its chief responsibilities: to give subsequent generations of artists something to build on. Looking at the Christie's show, New York can finally see what Judd meant. It makes his case with his art, on his home turf, in the city that nurtured his genius.
 Artists' museums -- the Rodin Museum in Paris, for example -- are rarely complete or packed with masterpieces. Yet their exclusive focus provides an organic, undiluted sense of an artist's basic operating principles, and that is what happens at Christie's. 
 The quantities of natural light and space here, as in Judd's Marfa displays, bring into sharp focus the way he combined the opposing modernist forces of Matisse and Duchamp -- art and anti-art, full-on retinal seduction and the cerebral provocation of the ready-made. Light makes his colors sing and also brings out the differences in his basic ready-made materials: metal, Plexiglas and plywood. Compare the amber color of an anodized aluminum wall stack, for example, with the glowing Plexiglas that surprises you at the bottom of a large floor box. 
 And like all artist's museums, this exhibition includes some unexpected quirks. One is a 1993 plain plywood wall piece, based on a 1961 red relief with a found-object brass circle at its center; here the circle is simply a hole exposing more plywood. 
 This piece almost makes a kind of joke of Judd's continued emphasis on a work's structural honesty, a concept he was continually tweaking. In 1988, he remade one of his first free-standing pieces -- an upright red right angle made of two slabs of wood with a found piece of right-angle pipe connecting their center points. The original was painted red, the second is stained red, allowing the (considerably fancier) grain to show. Judd also ''stained'' plywood with transparent colored Plexiglass, as in a beautiful late wall stack of small boxes that is on view in the lobby at Christie's. The interior back plane of each box is a different color.
 In some ways, this show may be more satisfying than visiting Marfa. Here, the art is unencumbered by all the Juddian trappings: the real estate, the collections, the lifestyle and the sense of the artist as proud possessor and reigning deity. It demonstrates how unfancy and basic a space can be and yet make art look really, really good. 
 The Christie's display also accentuates the void created in New York when the Dia Center for the Arts decamped up the Hudson River to Beacon and morphed from an institution dedicated to small single-artist installations into a conventional multi-artist museum. While waiting for Dia to re-establish a foothold in Manhattan, see this show. Imagine if it were a permanent installation, like Walter De Maria's Earth Room in SoHo. It would change art.

Through May 9 at the Simon & Schuster Building, 1230 Avenue of the Americas, at 48th Street.

HEADLINE: City Says It's Just Trying to Keep Peace, and Keep Out Drugs

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS

 BODY:
A trip to the Statue of Liberty, a spin through the Metropolitan Museum of Art, a Broadway show and a nightcap or three at one of New York's drinking establishments. For locals and out-of-towners alike, the city's bounty of 1,200 bars, lounges and dance clubs is an essential lure of city life. It is also a vital cog in the New York economy, generating an annual $9.7 billion in revenue and employing 19,000 people, according to the New York Nightlife Association.
 But a series of police raids one night late last month in Manhattan, which led to the shuttering of 5 establishments and the arrest of 20 people on drug charges, left many bar and club owners feeling under siege.
The police raids, which brought the number of temporary closings in the past year and a half to 200, come on the heels of the smoking ban, increased antipathy from neighborhood groups and a bill in the State Assembly that could severely limit new liquor licenses, especially in Manhattan. And on the Lower East Side and in SoHo, even new high-end restaurants are finding it difficult to obtain liquor licenses because of the well-organized opposition of local residents. 
 ''The feeling of people in the industry is that there is a huge 'Not Welcome' sign being posted by government,'' said Robert Bookman, a lobbyist for the nightlife association, a group of bars, clubs and lounges. ''The city doesn't realize it, but they're killing the goose that laid the golden egg.''
 Law enforcement officials insisted they are not waging a war on clubs. Instead, they said the recent raids, which involved dozens of officers swarming into clubs, bars and even a gym on the night of March 31, were prompted by complaints from local residents. 
 ''We expect people to keep illegal activity out of their premises,'' said Paul J. Browne, the Police Department's deputy commissioner for public information. ''The police have an obligation to stop it if the club operators will not or cannot.'' 
 Most of the businesses that were raided were allowed to reopen, according to Mr. Browne, after agreeing to adopt more stringent security measures and pay fines of $1,000 to $15,000. 
 While generally not denying the allegations, owners and managers said the truth is far less alarming. Except in the case of two bartenders accused of selling Ecstasy at Avalon, on West 20th Street, they said none of those arrested were employees of the clubs. All the drug arrests, which the police said took place over a 10-month period leading up to the closings, involved small amounts of drugs. Several of those arrested were not selling in the clubs but were apprehended during the course of the investigation, Mr. Browne said. 
 The owners of some of New York City's large clubs, like Avalon, Spirit and Speed, said they already spend thousands of dollars a week on security. Some of the security measures include searches of patrons and the use of undercover monitors who dress like clubgoers and rove the dance floor randomly asking patrons where they might find some Ecstasy.
 John Blair, a promoter at Spirit, on West 27th Street, said he spends about $3,000 a week on monitors who watch for illegal activity among the club's staff. Three of the six arrests that led to a nine-day shutdown of the club were for patrons smoking marijuana, according to court filings, and the other three were for patrons found with small quantities of Ecstasy or cocaine. In addition to a $10,000 fine, Mr. Blair said the weeklong closing resulted in $275,000 in lost revenue.
 ''We're not exactly a drug den,'' Mr. Blair said. ''We're really doing our best to stop drugs from coming in, but if a woman wants to sneak a pill in her bra, there's not much we can do about it.'' 
 Others suggested that the police were being overzealous. ''If you're really determined, you can buy drugs at McDonald's or at a schoolyard,'' said Brian Landeche, the owner of Splash, a gay bar on West 17th Street where the police say a patron sold cocaine to an undercover officer.
 Mr. Landeche, whose business was fined $10,000 and was ordered closed for nearly two weeks, said it was the first time his bar had been implicated in any drug activity. ''The amount of money this is costing me is hurtful, but the stain on reputation and my personal prestige is worse,'' he said.
 Expecting a large nightclub with thousands of patrons to be drug-free, many owners said, is unrealistic and unfair. ''Should George Steinbrenner be penalized if drugs are found at Yankee Stadium?'' asked Donald Bernstein, a lawyer who represents Avalon. ''Could you imagine the police closing down Madison Square Garden if drugs were found? Of course not. It's just easier to go after clubs.''
 Although city officials said they do not go out of their way to penalize the nightlife industry, club owners questioned why raids and court-ordered closings often occur on Friday nights. 
 David Rabin, whose lounge, Lotus, on West 14th Street, was shut down last year at the beginning of the Memorial Day weekend for serving under-age patrons, said many owners suspect the timing is designed to inflict maximum damage. 
 ''I can't tell you how frustrated many of my colleagues feel,'' said Mr. Rabin, who is also the president of the nightlife association.
 Mr. Browne, the Police Department spokesman, said the timing of the raids had to do with the availability of police manpower and the fact that many clubs get their largest crowds on weekends. ''We strike when the iron is hot,'' he said.
 Many business owners said they take issue with the city's 311 hot line, which has an anonymous complaint system that counts the number of calls against an establishment but does not tell officials if calls are coming from, say, 100 different residents or just one disgruntled neighbor.
 But for those who live in neighborhoods awash in bars, there is a war on, and any tactic for fighting back is fair game. 
 For several years, Ariel Palitz, the owner of Sutra Lounge on First Avenue and First Street, has been battling with two nearby neighbors who are unhappy about her bar's loud music. She spent $20,000 on soundproofing, but she said the neighbors continue to call 311, sometimes up to a dozen times a night, leading to almost daily visits from the police. The inspections and fines keep coming, she said, including a summons last month for having her ice scoopers improperly stored.
 ''I try hard to run a business, I work day and night to keep this going, but I feel like I'm being criminalized,'' she said. ''Sometimes I feel like I own a brothel rather than just a neighborhood bar.''
 Sean Sweeney, whose organization, the SoHo Alliance, has been trying to stanch the issuing of new liquor licenses downtown, says he recently spent more than $10,000 to move his bedroom to the rear of his Green Street apartment. Several of his neighbors, he said, have given up entirely and moved away.
 ''Mardi Gras lasts 12 days. Down here, it lasts 365 days a year,'' said Mr. Sweeney, who has lived in the neighborhood for decades. ''It's become party central for the entire metropolitan area. These clubs and bars are ruining people's lives, and they've got to be stopped.''

HEADLINE: Terror Case May Offer Clues Into Police Use Of Informants

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM

 BODY:
The trial of a Pakistani immigrant on charges that he plotted to bomb the Herald Square subway station in 2004 is likely to provide the most detailed picture to date of how the New York Police Department uses informants in and around the city's mosques.
 The trial of the man, Shahawar Matin Siraj, which begins today, is the first involving the department's Intelligence Division since a judge granted the police expanded surveillance powers in 2003. It also marks the first time since the Sept. 11 attacks that a terrorism investigation was largely conducted by the Intelligence Division and prosecuted in federal court. 
 The central witness will be a paid police informant who knew Mr. Siraj from a Brooklyn mosque and the nearby Islamic bookstore where he worked. Lawyers for Mr. Siraj, 23, have said they will seek to prove that he was entrapped. They have contended that Mr. Siraj, a quiet, mild-mannered man, was goaded into the bomb plot by an overzealous informant who showed him inflammatory pictures, including photographs of American soldiers abusing inmates at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq.
 The informant, Osama Eldawoody, secretly made audio and video recordings of his conversations with Mr. Siraj and another man, James Elshafay.
 The tapes, which will be played at the trial in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, contain a number of damning statements by Mr. Siraj, including one in which he says that while he will not place a bomb in the subway station, he will accompany and aid the man who will. And Mr. Siraj admitted after his arrest on Aug. 27, 2004, that the plan to bomb the Herald Square station -- one of a number of targets that were discussed during several conversations recorded by the informant -- was his idea.
 The men never obtained any explosives. Indeed, Mr. Eldawoody, who told the pair that he worked for a fictitious group called the Brotherhood, said he would provide the explosives. There was no timetable for an attack, and the men were not linked to any known terrorist group.
 Mr. Siraj and Mr. Elshafay, 21, according to prosecutors, were motivated by a wish to cause economic harm and disruption, but said they wanted to avoid killing people. Mr. Elshafay, who has pleaded guilty and is cooperating with the government, is expected to testify.
 The four-count indictment charges Mr. Siraj with conspiring to blow up the subway station, conspiring to blow up a subway car and other crimes. In the months after his arrest, Mr. Siraj, who came to the United States from Karachi, Pakistan, in 1999 to join his parents in Queens, turned down a plea deal that would have meant a 10-year prison sentence. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years.
 Martin R. Stolar, who along with Khurrum B. Wahid is defending Mr. Siraj, has argued that the entire plot was created by and driven by Mr. Eldawoody, an older Egyptian man who, according to court papers, first met Mr. Siraj in September 2003.
 ''They manufactured a crime,'' Mr. Stolar said of the police. ''It's an approach that has been seen in other places and other cases. And it is a very interesting investigative technique, where people who would otherwise not be disposed to being involved in any other kind of violence somehow get ensnared and then charged.''
 Mr. Stolar said the trial would provide a window into how the department operates and ''how they are conducting at least a part of the so-called war on terror.'' He suggested that the department has police informants in most of the city's mosques. 
 While it is known that the department has sought to create a wide network of informants in the Muslim community, details on the program have been closely held. Mr. Eldawoody's appearance as a witness will mark the first time such an informant will testify in open court about his or her work in and around a mosque. He will likely be questioned about how he came to be an informant, how much he was paid, how he reported to his handlers and other procedures relating to his work.
 Until February 2003, when a Manhattan federal judge's decision granted the Police Department new antiterror surveillance powers, there were significant restrictions on the Intelligence Division's work in mosques. The decision, by Judge Charles S. Haight Jr., cited an affidavit by David Cohen, the department's deputy commissioner for intelligence and a former senior official in the Central Intelligence Agency.
 Mr. Cohen said there were ''changed circumstances'' since the Sept. 11 attacks, among them that American mosques were largely radicalized, and had been used, along with other Islamic institutes, ''to shield the work of terrorists from law enforcement scrutiny by taking advantage of restrictions on the investigation of First Amendment activity.''
 Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly has frequently cited Mr. Siraj's case as an example of the department's ability to halt terrorists, in particular the lone-wolf attackers who are not affiliated with any known groups and thus harder to monitor and track.
 But little is publicly known about the practices of the Intelligence Division in such investigations and how its detectives navigate their potentially complex and dangerous legal shoals.
 Defense lawyers have said they might call Mr. Kelly to testify, but they would not discuss why, and it remains unclear whether the judge in the case, Nina Gershon, will allow it.
 While Mr. Stolar has sought to highlight the politics surrounding the government's counterterrorism efforts, one of the prosecutors, Todd Harrison, has downplayed them.
 ''This has nothing to do with the case, politics,'' Mr. Harrison, an assistant United States attorney, said at a hearing earlier this year, after Mr. Stolar sought to have potential jurors questioned about their views on the USA Patriot Act. ''It doesn't have anything to do with the Patriot Act. It doesn't have anything to do with the war in Iraq.''
 ''The allegations are that this defendant conspired to place a bomb in a subway,'' he added. ''That's it.''

HEADLINE: The Bull of Russian Investment Finds Himself in Forced Hibernation

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS and ANDREW E. KRAMER; Heather Timmons reported from London for this article and Andrew E. Kramer from Moscow.

DATELINE: LONDON, April 24 

 BODY:
William F. Browder is the largest foreign investor in Russia's stock market and one of the country's biggest promoters. But now the government won't allow him back into the country, and therein lies a tale of the sticky challenge of investing in a booming economy caught between the forces of capitalism and state control.
 Mr. Browder, 42, spent 10 years in Russia building Hermitage Capital Management into a $4 billion asset shop. As one of the most vocal critics of Russia's weak standards in corporate governance, he was responsible for fostering changes at giants like Lukoil and spurring new local laws to protect shareholders' rights.
Yet even though he has billions at stake in Russia, Mr. Browder is no longer welcome and has been stopped, literally, at the country's doorstep. 
 In November last year, Mr. Browder arrived at the V.I.P. lounge in a Moscow airport during one of dozens of annual trips he takes in and out of the country. Rather than being whisked through as usual, he was turned away with no explanation, even though he carried a valid visa.
 Since then, he said, politicians and businessmen from the British foreign secretary, Jack Straw, to Stephen Green, the chief of HSBC, have inquired on his behalf, to no avail. 
 Mr. Browder, who was born in America but gave up his passport to become a British citizen, finds himself in a paradox: he's pushing investment in many of Russia's largest companies, based on analyses of their business fundamentals, while suffering firsthand from the bureaucracy and capriciousness of the Russian system, which continues to scare some foreign investors away. 
 Mr. Browder is no stranger to paradox. His grandfather was Earl Browder, leader of the American Communist Party. The younger Mr. Browder decided to go to Russia while at the Stanford business school. 
 ''I had a romantic notion of following in my grandfather's footsteps to Russia, not as a communist but as a capitalist,'' he said in an interview in London, where he has been living since November. Underscoring such contradictions, Mr. Browder locates his Moscow office in a luxury high-rise building, but he decorates it with a socialist realist painting of Lenin at Finland Station. 
 Mr. Browder did not start the fund thinking that he would be campaigning to change Russia's governance standards. Instead, he said he was compelled to vocalize his criticisms by what he calls the ''orgy of stealing'' that the oligarchs embarked on after the Russian currency collapse. 
 ''It was pure necessity,'' he said. ''It wasn't like I was saying I wanted to be an activist. If I wasn't, they would have stolen everything from me.'' 
 Now, he says, the country is about ''halfway'' through its journey toward Western-style business practices, and the trip is taking much less time than he expected. That is part of the reason he says he does not want to abandon the country now. 
 ''By the time it gets to capitalism the way that we know it here, there aren't going to be any opportunities left,'' he said. ''It's in the difficult times that we make money.'' 
 He is not alone. Most banks and foreign investors, although not Mr. Browder, bailed out of Russia after the currency devalued in 1998. But they have come flooding back in, particularly institutional investors who are rushing to emerging markets for high returns, despite some warning signs. 
 Many foreign fund managers know about Mr. Browder's case, but ''are willing to look the other way and hold their nose, and plow their money in,'' said Gary N. Kleiman, founder of Kleiman International Consultants, an emerging markets research group based in Washington. Mr. Kleiman estimates that institutional investors have pumped as much as $10 billion into Russia this year. 
 They should appreciate the groundwork Mr. Browder has done. He filed dozens of shareholder lawsuits against Russia's biggest companies and prodded the wealthy and powerful in Moscow with reports exposing shady dealings and off-the-books revenue streams. All the while, he endorsed the case for investing in Russia.
 At one time or another, Mr. Browder has taken on Gazprom, the natural gas monopoly; Lukoil, the country's largest oil operator; and Unified Energy Systems, owner of the electricity grid. 
 The exact reasons for Mr. Browder's ouster remain unclear. He received a letter on Nov. 25 citing an article in a Russian federal law that denies entry to anyone who could be considered a threat to the security of the state or public order. So far, the government has made no other comment. 
 Three analysts in Moscow said they thought Mr. Browder's being barred from the country was tied to his pending lawsuit against Surgutneftegaz, Russia's fourth-largest oil company. Mr. Browder said he had heard dozens of conspiracy theories and believed none of them. 
 Mr. Browder was adamant that despite the visa issue, he was not considering changing his focus to another country. ''Russia is my place,'' he said, and it still has a lot of room to grow. ''I know the market, and I can smell opportunity from a long way away,'' he added. 
 Hermitage's complaints about corporate governance continue unabated. In the outstanding suit, Hermitage Capital Management is pressing Surgutneftegaz over an ownership structure that is complex even by Russian standards. Surgutneftegaz, or Surgut, pumps a million barrels a day from fields in western Siberia's Khanty-Mansiysk region, where the company also has its headquarters. Surgutneftegaz owns subsidiaries that in turn own stock in the parent company in a circular arrangement that locks up roughly 60 percent of the shares. 
 Vladimir Bogdanov, a Siberian billionaire, and other managers control the company and profits that have piled up to, by some estimates, more than $10 billion. The company is peculiar among Russian oil companies for this huge cash reserve.
 Mr. Bogdanov is an associate of President Vladimir V. Putin, dating to when Mr. Putin worked in local government in St. Petersburg. Hermitage sued to untangle the circular ownership in a case that has been heard in five regional and federal courts and is still pending. 
 Separately, Hermitage supported a shareholder lawsuit filed by Prosperity Capital Management, another Russia-focused hedge fund, to force dividend payments from the huge Surgut money pile. Though Prosperity lost this suit, Surgut grudgingly raised its dividend payments for 2004 and 2005, according to Eric Kraus, an analyst with Sovlink securities in Moscow. 
 ''They were not happy with the shareholder suits or the constant pressure,'' he said. ''It's coming down to dollars. You actually have to pay those pesky shareholders.'' 
 A spokesman for Surgutneftegaz said he could not address speculation that the company had choreographed Mr. Browder's immigration troubles because he was not authorized to discuss the issue. 
 Even Mr. Browder's competitors say they think he should be let back into the country. ''He helped bring a lot of money into the country,'' said Mattias Westman, a founding partner at Prosperity, another investor rewarded with success for betting on Russia's economy in recent years. 
 ''They're dealing with somebody who doesn't have a solid capital market perspective,'' he said about whoever organized Mr. Browder's departure. ''It's one of the problems with Russia. It's like the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing.''

Floodwaters were still sloshing around inside the houses of Eastover, a gated subdivision that was home to some of this city's wealthiest black residents, when the neighborhood association decided to hire a boat for a rescue operation last September. 
 The rescuers were not searching for someone stranded, but rather trying to retrieve a roster of residents from the association's offices so it could start learning who planned to move back.
 The group was so well organized and financed that it recently retained a professional planner to help respond to the city's requirement that devastated neighborhoods devise their own revival blueprints.
 Elsewhere, in the Lower Ninth Ward, a predominantly black working-class community where some of New Orleans's poorest people lived, displaced residents voice that same steely resolve to rebuild. But they had no neighborhood association, at least until mid-February, when Charmaine L. Marchand, the area's state representative, took it upon herself to create one. ''No one else was organizing,'' Ms. Marchand said, ''so I felt it fell upon me as the only elected official from the Lower Ninth to do something.'' 
 So while other neighborhood organizations were trying to assemble enough residents to justify the deployment of precious city services, those behind the newly minted Lower Ninth Ward Homeowners Association were busy writing bylaws and selecting officers well into March.
 Just as disparities between rich and poor were exposed in the days after Hurricane Katrina, class and wealth seem to be playing a significant role as elected officials struggle to determine which neighborhoods will be rebuilt and which should revert to swampland, if not bulldozed and sold en masse to a developer. While Eastover is full of the sound of saws ripping wood and the pneumatic punch of nail guns, the sound of the Lower Ninth Ward is mainly silence.
 On one level, the rebuilding plan approved in March by Mayor C. Ray Nagin appears to put every neighborhood on the same footing. That plan places responsibility on residents to determine who is moving back to their communities and to decide collectively on a vision for their neighborhood.
 But not every community has the same resources to track down former neighbors and draft a plan that can provide for things as diverse as a local elementary school and a grocery store. 
 ''Some communities are more able than others,'' said Steven Ringo, a retired Air Force sergeant who not long before the storm had returned to the Lower Ninth Ward, where he was born, to start a janitorial services business. ''People don't have the same training and background and schooling and experience at working the system.''
 More than half the residents of the Lower Ninth Ward own their home, according to census figures, and yet before the hurricane only one small corner of the ward, the Holy Cross neighborhood, an enclave of historically significant homes, had established a homeowners association. 
 The Lower Ninth had been a tightknit community, but the lack of a strong organization meant that there was no board of directors to take charge immediately after the storm, as the Eastover Property Owners Association did. There was also no central database of residents' names and e-mail addresses.
 As a result, while the Eastover group had contacted virtually all the subdivision's 350 households by early January, the Lower Ninth Ward Homeowners Association, Ms. Marchand said, had tracked down only a small fraction of its residents. The city has said that a neighborhood's ability to draw back a ''critical mass'' of its people will be a crucial indicator of whether it can be redeveloped and receive city services.
 The Lower Ninth Ward has been further handicapped because so many of its residents are far from home and lack the means to participate in planning, said Muriel Lewis, director of the National Association of Katrina Evacuees, an advocacy group that lobbies on behalf of Gulf Coast evacuees scattered across 25 states. No other New Orleans neighborhood has as many residents dispersed around the country as the Lower Ninth, Ms. Lewis said. 
 ''We're talking about people who don't have the money to just pick up and come here for a meeting, no matter what the stakes,'' she said.
 Unlike Eastover, which did not exist until the mid-1980's, the Lower Ninth is a community rich in history, home to families whose roots date back generations. Yet it is also a community where the average home sells for $60,000 to $75,000, while in Eastover the homes start at around $400,000 and are more typically priced in the millions. 
 ''You had doctors and lawyers and your successful entrepreneurs in Eastover,'' said Ruston Henry, who lived in the Lower Ninth Ward and ran a pharmacy there before the hurricane. ''Here you had just hard-working people. You have your mechanics and waiters down here, people not used to working the system.''
 Even the architects of the city's reconstruction plan acknowledge that it favors better-off communities. From the outset, said Joseph C. Canizaro, the plan's primary author, its success has depended greatly on the availability of outside experts, including architects, planners and economic development professionals, who would help residents develop their blueprints. 
 ''From the beginning, we've believed it was critical to provide communities, especially our poorer communities, the help they need in working out a plan,'' Mr. Canizaro said.
 Yet obtaining the $7.5 million that Mr. Canizaro and other officials estimate New Orleans needs to pay for those experts has proved difficult. The city initially thought the federal government would provide the money, but when Washington declined, the City Council decided in late March that it had no choice but to devote $2.9 million in community development funds to hire outside planning experts. 
 ''This helps, but we should've started two months ago,'' said Oliver M. Thomas Jr., president of the New Orleans City Council. 
 [Last week the Rockefeller Foundation pledged $3.5 million to the rebuilding effort. That money will be used to underwrite the cost of hiring urban planners, architects and other experts, and also to hold planning meetings in Atlanta, Baton Rouge, Dallas and Houston, the four cities with the greatest number of displaced New Orleanians.] 
 ''I'm sure people in the Lower Ninth Ward, once they have their hand on the pencil, will draw up something good,'' Mr. Thomas said. ''But we need to provide organizers the support they need to help them create a new vision for their community.'' 
 The Lower Ninth is not entirely without resources. Mr. Thomas was born and raised there, and any number of outside groups -- among them the National Trust for Historic Preservation and the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, an activist body better known by its acronym, Acorn -- have been working to help the area recover. 
 Yet it is also a community that was harder hit than any other in New Orleans. Even today, nearly eight months after the storm, there are no FEMA trailers in the Lower Ninth Ward because the area is still without gas and drinkable water.
 Eastover, on the other hand, had electricity and other utilities before most of its neighbors elsewhere in the battered eastern half of the city.
 ''The Lower Ninth Ward is dead compared to my area,'' said Ms. Lewis, of the evacuees association, who before the hurricane lived in a middle-class neighborhood in eastern New Orleans. ''We have people working on their homes every day. There's nothing in the Lower Ninth Ward.''

HEADLINE: Iran Is Described as Defiant On 2nd Nuclear Program

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and NAZILA FATHI; David E. Sanger reported from Washington for this article, and Nazila Fathi from Tehran.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 24 

 BODY:
Iran has told the International Atomic Energy Agency that it will refuse to answer questions about a second, secret uranium-enrichment program, according to European and American diplomats. The existence of the program was disclosed by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad earlier this month.
 The diplomats said Iran had also refused to answer questions about other elements of its nuclear program that international inspectors had focused on because they could indicate a program to produce nuclear weapons. The diplomats insisted on not being identified because of the delicacy of continuing negotiations between Iran and the West. 
Separately, Mr. Ahmadinejad said he saw no need for Iran to hold talks with the United States about Iraq now that a new government had been formed, declaring at a rare news conference that with the formation of a government ''the occupiers should leave and allow Iraqi people to run their country.''
 Together, the actions seem to show Iran's determination to move ahead with a confrontation with the West when the United Nations Security Council meets, probably next week, to debate its next steps. 
 Iran's decision not to answer the I.A.E.A.'s questions was conveyed last week to Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei, the director general of the nuclear monitoring agency. He is required to send a report on Iran to the Council by Friday.
 As a result, the diplomats said, Dr. ElBaradei decided to cancel a trip to Iran by top officials of the agency that had been scheduled for late last week, a trip intended to resolve as many of the questions as possible before the report is submitted.
 Diplomats involved in the tense dialogue with Iran said that, barring a last-minute change, Dr. ElBaradei's report would declare, in what one European official called ''a series of understatements,'' that Iran had done nothing to resolve the questions that the Council late last month gave it 30 days to answer. 
 R. Nicholas Burns, the under secretary of state for political affairs, said Monday evening, ''We are very confident that the report is going to be negative concerning Iran's refusal to meet the conditions set down by the United Nations Security Council and the I.A.E.A.'' He added that Iran was in ''outright violation'' of the Council request.
 Some of the most important questions concerned an advanced technology, the P-2 centrifuge, for enriching uranium. International inspectors believe that Iran obtained designs for the P-2 from the Pakistani nuclear engineer Abdul Qadeer Khan in the 1990's. 
 Iran long denied that it was doing anything with the technology, until Mr. Ahmadinejad declared 10 days ago that the country was ''presently conducting research'' on the P-2, which he said could increase fourfold the amount of uranium the country is able to enrich.
 Mr. Ahmadinejad's statement took the inspectors and American officials by surprise. But they seized on his boasts about Iran's programs to press the question of whether the country has a separate set of nuclear facilities, apart from the giant enrichment center at Natanz, that it has not previously revealed. Dr. ElBaradei was told when he visited Tehran, the Iranian capital, two weeks ago that the country would try to answer questions about the P-2 program, its dealings with Mr. Khan in the 1980's and 90's and a series of other issues.
 Dr. ElBaradei's inspectors were pressing other issues as well, many related to suspicions that Iran has been researching or developing ways to produce warheads or delivery systems for weapons -- which Iran has denied. So far, Iran has answered few questions about a document in Tehran, apparently obtained from the Khan network, that shows how to form uranium metal into two spheres. Metal in that form can be used to create a basic nuclear device. 
 I.A.E.A. reports show there are also questions about plutonium enrichment, and a secret entity known as the Green Salt Project, which seemed to suggest that there were what the agency has called ''administrative interconnections'' between Iran's uranium processing, high explosives and missile design programs.
 If Iran continues to refuse to answer the questions, it could bolster the American argument that the Security Council should take action under Article 7 of the United Nations Charter, which could pave the way for sanctions. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, speaking in Shannon, Ireland, said Monday that the credibility of the Council would be in doubt if it does not take clear-cut actions against Iran. 
 But China and Russia have both expressed deep reservations about any measures meant to coerce Iran, and Mr. Ahmadinejad vaguely suggested Monday, as he has before, that he would consider pulling his country out of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty if membership was no longer in Iran's interests. North Korea did that in 1993, expelling all inspectors, and they have not been allowed to return.
 ''Our current policy is to work within the framework of the NPT and I.A.E.A., but if we feel that there is no benefit in it for us, we will review our policy,'' he said. ''We must see what the benefits of cooperating with the I.A.E.A. are after 30 years.'' 
 Mr. Ahmadinejad rejected the United Nations deadline of Friday for Iran to suspend its nuclear program. He brushed off threats of economic sanctions, saying that sanctions would hurt Western nations more than Iran. 
 He also rejected a proposal by Moscow to enrich uranium on Russian soil. The proposal was aimed at easing international concern over Iran's nuclear program. While some Iranian officials rejected the proposal in the past, others suggested that Iran might accept it under certain conditions. 
 There were signs of dissent within his government, however. The former chief nuclear negotiator, Hassan Rowhani, urged the government in a speech on Thursday to return to talks with Europe over the nuclear program, the daily newspaper Shargh reported.

HEADLINE: Limelight Finds New White House Deputy

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 24 

 BODY:
Joel D. Kaplan, the new White House deputy chief of staff for policy, has been a member of President Bush's team since the 2000 campaign, and if there was any lingering doubt about his commitment, it ended last week when he cut short his honeymoon in Hawaii to rush back to his new job.
 A former marine, a clerk to two conservative judges and a Harvard graduate, Mr. Kaplan has been thrust into a high-profile White House job in which he will play a crucial role in the effort to salvage Mr. Bush's second-term agenda. 
Named to the post last week after serving as an aide to the new chief of staff, Joshua B. Bolten, in the Office of Management and Budget, Mr. Kaplan is taking over responsibility for day-to-day management of domestic policy making in the White House. 
 He picks up that portfolio from Karl Rove, who relinquished those duties last week as part of the continuing overhaul of the West Wing and will focus more on the midterm elections.
 Mr. Kaplan, 36, grew up a Democrat. But he has acquired sterling conservative credentials.
 A graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law School, he worked as a law clerk for two conservative stars, Justice Antonin Scalia of the Supreme Court and Judge J. Michael Luttig of federal appeals court, who had been on Mr. Bush's short list for the Supreme Court. Mr. Kaplan registered as a Republican in the late 1990's.
 Colleagues inside and outside the White House said Mr. Kaplan's promotion came about largely because of his closeness to Mr. Bolten.
 ''Kaplan is Josh Bolten's Josh Bolten,'' said Cesar V. Conda, a Republican strategist and a former economic policy adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney.
 Mr. Kaplan declined to be interviewed. 
 Mr. Kaplan, who grew up in a Democratic family in Massachusetts, joined Mr. Bush's 2000 campaign as a volunteer at the end of a political conversion that friends said was brought about by the fall of the Berlin Wall and a stint as an artillery officer in the Marine Corps (he did not see combat).
 He quickly became an important member of Mr. Bolten's policy team at Mr. Bush's campaign headquarters in Austin, Tex. He moved with Mr. Bolten from the campaign to the White House to the Office of Management and Budget.
 To some lawmakers, Mr. Kaplan has been viewed as something of a whippersnapper. During his confirmation hearings in 2003 for the post of deputy director at the Office of Management and Budget, Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, addressed him by saying, ''I'm not accustomed to calling people as young as you 'Mr.,' but I'm going to observe the protocol here.''
 Though the Senate unanimously confirmed Mr. Kaplan, Mr. Lautenberg also grilled him about reports that he was on hand for the so-called Brooks Brothers protest in November 2000, when a large group of Bush supporters -- many in business attire -- stormed a room in Florida where supervisors were conducting a ballot recount.
 Asked by senators in 2003 whether he was part of the protest, Mr. Kaplan said he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. ''My responsibilities and role was to go into the room and be an official observer,'' Mr. Kaplan said. ''So while I was there, I was not, to my recollection, a participant.''
 Associates described Mr. Kaplan as being a calm, quick-witted workaholic with a perfectionist streak. He will be working alongside some of the most powerful and seasoned people in Washington at a time of intense pressure on the White House to strengthen Mr. Bush's political standing and produce initiatives that Republicans can run on in the fall.
 But one longtime friend, Kristen Silverberg, said Mr. Kaplan would be able to navigate any competing interests. ''The job is to be an honest broker and a careful analyst and coordinator of policy issues,'' said Ms. Silverberg, an assistant secretary of state who formerly worked alongside Mr. Rove in the White House.
 Mr. Kaplan is a Red Sox fan who loves to play golf when he has the time, and friends said he had been hoping to play in Hawaii.
 Nigel Jones, Mr. Kaplan's best man and a close friend since the ninth grade, said Mr. Kaplan took the abrupt halt to his honeymoon in stride. ''It's par for the course,'' Mr. Jones said.

HEADLINE: McNealy Yields Post As Sun Chief 

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF and LAURIE J. FLYNN; Steve Lohr contributed reporting from New York for this article.

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, April 24 

 BODY:
Sun Microsystems said Monday that Scott G. McNealy, one of its founders, was stepping aside after 22 years as chief executive, an era in which Sun helped establish the dominance of the microprocessor chip in corporate computing. 
 Jonathan Schwartz, the company's president and Mr. McNealy's handpicked successor, was named chief executive, effective immediately. Mr. McNealy, 51, who founded Sun in 1982 with three young partners, will remain as chairman.
The announcement came after Sun announced a quarterly net loss of $217 million, which it attributed largely to acquisitions, but said revenue had grown more than 20 percent. Its stock showed little change in postsession trading after the earnings report, but the McNealy announcement then sent it up more than 8 percent.
 In a conference call with reporters and analysts, Mr. McNealy went to some lengths to stress that Sun would stay on the course he had set to pull it out of its prolonged malaise since the dot-com collapse in 2000. 
 He insisted that the leadership transition was not abrupt, but was the conclusion of planning that began after a former president, Edward J. Zander, left the company in 2002.
 ''I wasn't going to hand it off when it was deteriorating,'' Mr. McNealy said. ''We showed wonderful growth last quarter.''
 Mr. Schwartz, 40, a former software entrepreneur, joined Sun in 1996 when it acquired his company, Lighthouse Design. He has been known as an innovative strategist at Sun, and his trademark ponytail has helped identify him with Silicon Valley's software design culture. 
 Although the two men are at much different points on the political spectrum, with Mr. McNealy an outspoken conservative, they have complemented each other on business strategy. ''He and I can finish each other's sentences,'' Mr. McNealy said. ''We're very aligned.''
 Indeed, partners and customers marveled on Monday at Mr. McNealy's staying power. Sun, based in Santa Clara, Calif., has essentially performed well in three separate eras of computing, stumbling badly at times in the last five years. 
 The company was founded as a maker of computer workstations for technical and scientific computing applications in the early 1980's and rose to prominence based on the computing world's shift away from proprietary mainframes and minicomputers and toward commodity components and open standards. 
 In the late 1980's and early 90's, it built a computing clientele on Wall Street and in corporate computing markets. Finally, the rise of the commercial Internet and the initial explosion of Web server computers swept Sun to peak revenue of $18.25 billion in 2001.
 But in 2000 telecommunications companies abruptly stopped spending, and Sun, which had taken to calling itself ''the dot in dot-com,'' found itself a victim of a financial meltdown in the computing equipment market.
 Still, Mr. McNealy's legacy will be not only the company he built, but also a generation of technology leaders who worked under him, including Mr. Zander, now the chief executive at Motorola; Carol Bartz, chairwoman of Autodesk, the engineering software firm; and Eric E. Schmidt, chief executive of Google.
 ''Scott is one of the great leaders of Silicon Valley,'' said Mr. Schmidt, who worked for 14 years at Sun. ''I'm just floored that this happened. I believed that he would continue on for the next 50 years.''
 Vinod Khosla, a Sun founder, said Monday that as a leader, Mr. McNealy had helped define a Silicon Valley tradition.
 ''Scott is one of those people who build successful companies with passion and a belief system,'' said Mr. Khosla, now a Silicon Valley venture capitalist. ''This doesn't happen with executives who are simply managing, based on business-process ideas. You see this same passion in people like Steve Jobs, Andy Grove and Larry Ellison, as well.''
 Another founder, Bill Joy, said: ''The industry has transitioned or convulsed several times since he has been there. It's amazing that someone can survive and do well in several different eras.''
 Investors were pleased with the changing of the guard. The news caused shares of Sun to jump 8.8 percent in after-hours trading, to $5.42, after gaining 5 cents, to $4.98, on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
 Brent Bracelin, an analyst with Pacific Crest Securities, commented: ''I think McNealy is done interfacing with Wall Street. He's lost a lot of investor confidence. But there are a lot of customers who appreciate what he's done with products and have started to buy again.''
 Mr. McNealy said the decision was made at a late-night board meeting on Friday, at which he argued that the timing was right because Sun's quarterly performance showed solid improvement. 
 He said he would continue to work full time as the head of Sun's efforts to sell to the federal government, its largest customer. 
 ''The timing fit me to a 'T,' and it was my call,'' Mr. McNealy said. 
 The announcement Monday came minutes after the company disclosed its results for the third quarter, ended March 26. Its net loss of $217 million, or 6 cents a share, compared with a loss of $28 million in the quarter a year earlier. Sun attributed the increased loss primarily to expenses related to its acquisition of Storagetek, a storage and data backup company, and SeeBeyond, an enterprise software business.
 The company said the results included $87 million in costs associated with its two deals, as well as $57 million in expenses for stock-based compensation and $36 million in restructuring charges. Sun's revenue rose to $3.18 billion from $2.63 billion a year earlier. The results were largely in line with the estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call.
 Gary Beach, publisher of CIO Magazine, said of the leadership transition: ''This move will strengthen Sun economically, at least in terms of its perception on Wall Street. '' 
 According to CIO Magazine's regular surveys, the Sun strategy of embracing open-source software is making headway with corporate customers, Mr. Beach said.
 Mr. McNealy, he added, was well suited for his new role of focusing more on talking to large Sun customers and less on managing the company day to day. ''Sun may well benefit,'' Mr. Beach said, ''if this means Scott McNealy is getting out there more often, telling the Sun story. That's what he's good at.''
 Those who believe that Mr. McNealy has made progress in turning Sun around point to the return of a fourth founder, Andreas Bechtolsheim, who came back to Sun after the computer maker acquired his start-up firm in 2004, and of Michael E. Lehman, who left retirement to serve as chief financial officer.
 The company is betting on a new product line that Mr. Bechtolsheim is designing based on processors made by Advanced Micro Devices. The new machines break from Sun's long reliance on its custom Sparc microprocessors and make it possible for customers to run either Linux or Windows software easily.
 Indeed, it is Mr. McNealy's steady focus on Sun's competition with Microsoft, some executives believe, that led him to miss a turning point in the industry. Sun was late in responding to the threat of the open-source Linux operating system, which gained tremendous market share in many markets that Sun had dominated in the last decade.

HEADLINE: Analyze These

BYLINE: By BENEDICT CAREY

 BODY:
He began his long and transcendent career in a nondescript laboratory on the Adriatic Sea, dissecting eels. 
 He examined hundreds of the animals, working long hours amid stench and slime, peering through a microscope at countless tissue samples, in search of an organ that had eluded earlier anatomists -- male testicles.
 ''Since eels do not keep diaries,'' the investigator, 19-year-old Sigmund Freud, wrote to a friend in the spring of 1876, the only way to determine gender was to cut and slice, ''but in vain, all the eels which I cut open are of the fairer sex.'' 
 He ended the letter by sketching an eel, swimming through the text, its face fixed with a slight, Mona Lisa smile. 
 Beginning May 11, the New York Academy of Medicine will exhibit the largest collection of Freud's drawings ever assembled, including several pieces from private collectors that have not been displayed in public. The drawings, some embedded in letters and scientific essays, chart the evolution of the Austrian neurologist's thinking, from his early and lesser-known devotion to marine anatomy to the psychological theory that would alter forever humans' conception of themselves and launch a discipline, psychoanalysis, that dominated psychiatry for half a century. The American Psychoanalytic Association and the New York Psychoanalytic Society and Institute collaborated in the exhibition.
 Freud's methods have fallen from favor in recent decades, but science historians say that his investigation of the unconscious more than a century ago stands as a revolutionary achievement that still informs many therapists' understanding of memory, trauma and behavior.
 The exhibit is one of many events being held around the world this spring to commemorate the 150th anniversary of Freud's birth, May 6, 1856. These include scholarly lectures, conferences and films, as well as lighter fare, like ''On the Couch: Cartoons from The New Yorker,'' at the Museum of the City of New York, running through July 23.
 Freud's drawings were serious science, the eel doodle notwithstanding. In the latter part of the 19th century, German researchers considered drawing to be instrumental to scientific discovery, both as a way to capture the microscopic detail of nerve cells, for example, and to illustrate theories of how the brain might work, said Lynn Gamwell, the curator of the exhibit and the director of the Art Museum at the State University of New York at Binghamton. ''Einstein once said that when he thought about science, he thought visually, he thought in pictures, and this appears to be the case with Freud,'' said Dr. Gamwell, a professor of science history. 
 Freud's drawings tell a story in three acts, from biology to psychology, from the microscope to the couch. The first, from Freud's college years into his mid-20's, took place in laboratories, where he examined the nervous systems of crayfish and lamprey, among other animals. The 21 drawings from this period would look familiar to anyone who used a microscope in high school, but on closer inspection betray compulsive detail. 
 One, titled, ''On the structure of the nerve fibers and nerve cells of the river crayfish,'' depicts four types of nerve cells and minutely details the elements in the nuclei, the cell bodies shaded so carefully that they appear three-dimensional, alive, alien eyeballs bobbing in space. 
 In another sketch, of the spinal anatomy of the lamprey, nerve fibers braid together like climbing vines, with cells hung throughout like clusters of ripening grapes. 
 These are the work of someone who loved the laboratory, scholars say, and who seemed to invest even his earliest efforts with a sense of importance, a conviction that he was about to break something big.
 ''That is the way Freud's mind worked,'' wrote Ernest Jones, a disciple of Freud's, in his 1953 biography, ''The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud.'' 
 ''When he got hold of a simple but significant fact he would feel, and know, that it was an example of something general or universal,'' Dr. Jones wrote.
 By his late 20's, Freud had gained some experience with patients and, in a second phase of his career, he began to focus on brain function rather than descriptive anatomy. 
 One drawing from this period, meant to illustrate the brain's auditory system, is as spare and geometric as a Calder sculpture, with fibers running between neural regions. The sketch is meant to represent specific pathways in the brain, but the depiction is dramatically more abstract than his earlier work. 
 In another, from an unpublished essay titled, ''Introduction to Neuropathology,'' looping lines connect several nodes in a diagram intended to show how areas of the brain represent the body, arms, face, hands. 
 ''It is no exaggeration to say that this insight is the precise point at which the mind -- that aspect of the organism which represents the body not concretely but rather functionally, abstractly and symbolically -- entered Freud's scientific work,'' Mark Solms wrote in a commentary that accompanies the drawings. 
 Dr. Solms, a psychoanalyst and professor of neuropsychology at the University of Cape Town, translated the works from the original German. 
 At the time these drawings appeared, many neurologists presumed the body was somehow mirrored in the brain, perhaps altered in form but recognizable, intact. 
 Yet in this sketch and others like it, Freud said the brain worked differently, that its fibers and cells ''contain the body periphery in the same way as a poem contains the alphabet, in a complete rearrangement,'' based on a body part's function, not its location, Dr. Solms writes. Later research supported Freud's conception. 
 To capture what was running through the young scientist's own mind in this period, the mid-1880's, might require a Goya or a Lucian Freud, an artist familiar with longing and euphoria, frustration and deep anxiety. For Freud was in love, engaged in a tumultuous courtship with Martha Bernays of Vienna, complete with feuds with her mother and brother. He was experimenting with cocaine, on himself and on others, for a variety of mental and physical ailments, with increasingly disastrous results. And he was consumed by anxieties about his purpose, his scientific future and, most of all, his income. 
 Full-time research appointments were hard to secure at the time, especially for Jews, and Freud's scientific work provided very little income. He was desperately trying to raise money to pay for his wedding.
 ''He started taking in patients out of economic necessity,'' said Dr. Charles Brenner, a psychoanalyst and the author of ''An Elementary Textbook of Psychoanalysis.'' 
 ''Had he had a rich father, or not been a Jew, he would have stayed in the lab for the rest of his days,'' Dr. Brenner said. ''But because he had to treat patients with psychogenic illnesses, it forced him to keep searching for treatments to help him in his own work.''
 This part of Freud's career -- the third phase, -- has become as familiar as Einstein's thought experiments with the streetcar or Darwin's ruminations on finches. 
 Freud became fascinated by the case of a young German woman, known to history as Anna O., a colleague's patient. Anna O. suffered from debilitating hallucinations and paralysis that dissipated when she talked about the symptoms. 
 Freud experimented with this ''talking cure'' and found it soothed several of his own patients who were suffering from similar psychosomatic symptoms, then called hysteria. 
 From 1892 to 1895, he refined his therapy to include free association, encouraging patients to trace the threads of their memory, back to when their symptoms first surfaced, and beyond, to earliest childhood. On these excavations, and in his self-analysis, Freud gathered the evidence on which he built his famous theory of the basic geography of the psyche: the primal id, the rational ego and the censorious superego.
 He continued drawing diagrams to illustrate his findings. The first purely psychoanalytic drawing, Dr. Solms said, appeared in an 1894 letter from Freud to his friend and colleague, Dr. Wilhelm Fleiss. The style is reminiscent of earlier sketches -- looping lines connecting nodes -- but the nodes now represent psychological processes like memory, not physical locations in the brain. 
 A few years later, the diagrams become much more abstract: A sketch from 1900 illustrating the mental processes involved in dreaming looks like a bar graph. 
 A diagram completed in 1898, ''The Psychical Mechanism of Forgetfulness,'' resembles the schematic for an air-conditioning system, complete with arrows and boxes. 
 But by 1900, when Freud's groundbreaking book ''The Interpretation of Dreams'' appeared, the transformation from anatomist to psychologist was complete. His love of anatomy had long ago waned; his commitment to drawing had not. 
 ''I see no necessity to apologize for the imperfections of this or of any similar imagery,'' Freud wrote of the dream diagrams. ''Analogies of this kind are only intended to assist us in our attempt to make the complications of mental functioning intelligible.''
 He continued, ''So far as I know, the experiment has not hitherto been made of using this method of dissection in order to investigate the way in which the mental instrument is put together, and I can see no harm in it. 
 ''We are justified, in my view, in giving free reign to our speculations so long as we retain the coolness of our judgment,'' Freud wrote, ''and do not mistake the scaffolding for the building.''

 CORRECTION:
An article in Science Times on Tuesday about an exhibition of Sigmund Freud's drawings misspelled the surname of a longtime friend and collaborator of Freud's. He was Wilhelm Fliess, not Fleiss.

From Eels to Ids and Superegos: Freud the Artist Goes on Display: 1876-1882 -- Freud's earliest scientific drawings, from his 20's, are careful renderings of neurons and fibers under the microscope, in tissue from fish and the human brainstem.
MID-1880'S -- Freud begins to think about the functioning of networks in the brain. His drawings, while still anatomical, become more abstract.
LATE 1890'S EARLY 1900'S -- The diagrams become entirely theoretical as Freud works out the psychological processes underlying neuroses in his own patients
1930'S -- Late in life, Freud is still drawing, here illustrating his theory of the basic geography of the mind. In German, ''Es'' is the id, ''Ich'' the ego and ''Uberich'' the superego. (Photos by Sigmund Freud Collection/Library of Congress [top left]

HEADLINE: Ants, Better With Dose of Humanity (and Humor)

BYLINE: By James Gorman

 BODY:
I have just had an epiphany while reading about ants, and I would like to thank Walter R. Tschinkel, distinguished research professor of biological science at Florida State University.
 Dr. Tschinkel is the author of ''The Fire Ants,'' a new book that I started to read because it has to do with venomous insects -- always fun -- and because E. O. Wilson says in the foreword that it's a ''masterpiece.'' Since Dr. Wilson, a professor emeritus at Harvard and lately an eloquent voice for conservation, won one of his two Pulitzer Prizes for ''The Ants,'' written with Bert Holldobler, I figured he should know.
I have been reading bits and pieces of the book, dipping in here and there like a chimpanzee with a twig, fishing for ants, and each time I have come up with something tasty and nutritious. For instance, some fire ants live in colonies with one queen, others with multiple queens, and a change in one gene determines the ants' way of life. And I was surprised and intrigued to learn that the tasks of workers were determined by age. The very last job in a worker's life is foraging for food outside of the nest. 
 But it wasn't a new crumb of scientific information found in my foraging that turned on the cartoon light bulb in my head. Nor was it Dr. Tschinkel's way with the language, although he does have a nice touch. For example, he describes the male fire ant on a mating flight as a ''heat-seeking missile for insemination.''
 Enlightenment came, instead, as I read the ''Interludes'' that Dr. Tschinkel has sprinkled throughout the book. These are observations and anecdotes not about the ants, but about the scientists who study them, about the personal experience of myrmecology. My favorite, an economical two-page essay called ''The Porter Wedge Micrometer: Mental Health for Myrmecologists,'' ought to be required reading for any scientist who wants to write for the public. 
 Myrmecologists, as any entomologist or, for that matter, any etymologist, knows, are scientists who specialize in ants. Apparently one of the common rites of passage in myrmecology is the measuring of ants, in particular the heads of ants, which can be done by holding an ant in forceps steady under a stereomicroscope and judging its size with a scale built into the scope's eye piece. The process, Dr. Tschinkel explains, is maddening:
 ''You have now entered a dangerous domain, in which you cannot remain for long without suffering serious brain damage. One of my master's students quit graduate school after the 4,000th head-width measurement. Her own head slightly unstable on her neck, she bumped into the doorjamb on her way out.''
 Another student of his, Sanford Porter, invented a tool to make the process simpler, a small wedge with markings on the side to indicate head diameter -- the wedge micrometer. It allowed researchers to pulverize the ants into powder, pick out heads and slide each into the wedge with the tip of a finger.
 The tool makes the whole process much easier, except that some researchers don't use it because, Dr. Tschinkel says, they are tied to tradition despite the supposed cold rationality of the scientific enterprise. He compares them to ''John Henry, pitted against that steam drill there at the Big Bend Tunnel on the C&O line.''
 This brief essay is entertaining and significant, a real glimpse of what science is and how it is done by human beings, rational and un-, grappling with technique, nature and the gathering of information.
 This is what the public needs to know about science, not just the results presented in the driest form possible. My epiphany came when I realized that all scientific journals should require interludes and asides -- little stories to go along with methods, discussion and conclusions. 
 Even good writers fall prey to the stranglehold of scientific jargon. In Nature for April 20, Sean Carroll, author of the elegantly written ''Endless Forms Most Beautiful,'' wrote about the evolution of pigment spots on the wings of male fruit flies. There is not a laugh in that paper, not one self-deprecating anecdote, not even a brief mention about how so and so spilled the fruit flies at a crucial moment (this had to have happened, I just know it) .
 Or consider ''A Bivalent Chromatin Structure Marks Key Developmental Genes in Embryonic Stem Cells,'' by Bradley et al, in Cell, the subject of one of the articles in this issue of Science Times. 
 Honestly, nothing calls out for a personal aside like ''highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs) in mammalian genomes.''
 It's time for readers of scientific journals to rise up and demand interludes, anecdotes, even jokes in scientific papers. 
 And scientists, if you wonder why the public doesn't like you, read one of your papers. Scientific language is necessary. But so is speaking plainly. And if you have something funny, or human, to tell, that won't undermine your work. But it may bring it to a wider audience.

PERSON: William P. Gottlieb

HEADLINE: William Gottlieb, 89, Jazz Photographer

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
William P. Gottlieb, who with a boxy, old-fashioned press camera indelibly defined what jazz looked like in a brief, magical time when both early legends like Armstrong and Ellington and the emerging beboppers ruled the bandstands and radio waves, died on Sunday at his home in Great Neck, N.Y. He was 89.
 The cause was a stroke, his wife, Delia, said. 
Mr. Gottlieb was not paid for his now-celebrated photographs of the great names of jazz; took only a few pictures at a time because he could not afford flashbulbs; and happily walked away from the field after less than a decade. Three decades later, after a successful career writing children's books and filmstrips, his past returned when a bookstore owner persuaded him to publish a book of jazz photos. The result was ''The Golden Age of Jazz'' (1979).
 It is now in its 12th printing. 
 In one image, among the most reproduced photograph in jazz history, one can almost hear the anguish in Billie Holiday's voice. In another, a very young Miles Davis reverently gazes at Howard McGhee playing his trumpet. 
 ''Gottlieb was not taking pictures; he was photographing a music,'' Whitney Balliett wrote in his review of the book in The New Yorker. ''Again and again, he catches the precise moment when the musician's face is suffused with effort and emotion and beauty: the music is there.''
 In 1994, the United States Postal Service selected Mr. Gottlieb's portraits as the basis for stamps of Charlie Parker and other jazz greats. The next year, he sold about 2,000 black-and-white images to the Library of Congress.
 ''He was more successful in his approach than any photographer has been, bringing to bear the personal connections -- his relationship with the subject's personality,'' Jon Newsom, director of the library's music division, said.
 Jazz has long infatuated photographers, including Herman Leonard, Francis Wolff and the bassist Milt Hinton. Flights of jazz improvisation, framed by shadows, incandescent light and swirling smoke, can seem almost unbearably compelling.
 Capturing it is easier said than done.
 ''I learned to shoot very carefully,'' Mr. Gottlieb said. ''I knew the music. I knew the musicians. I knew in advance when the right moment would arrive. It was purposeful shooting.''
 William Paul Gottlieb was born on Jan. 28, 1917, in the Canarsie section of Brooklyn. His family soon moved to Bound Brook, N.J., where his father ran a lumber and coal business. His parents died when he was a teenager.
 At Lehigh University, he majored in economics and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. In 1936, he contracted trichinosis from undercooked pork. While he lay in bed for months, a friend played jazz records, slowly transforming a Guy Lombardo fan into a jazz buff.
 Mr. Gottlieb returned to Lehigh and began writing a jazz column for a campus magazine. After graduation, he got a job with the advertising department of The Washington Post and soon persuaded an editor to let him write a Sunday jazz column.
 A photographer accompanied him, but The Post decided this was too expensive, since evening work meant overtime payments. Mr. Gottlieb used his own money to buy a 31/4-inch by 41/4-inch Speed Graphic press camera, film and flashbulbs. Post photographers taught him the rudiments of picture-taking.
 Mr. Gottlieb preferred words to pictures, and his interviews with musicians determined his photographic approach. For example, he rejected Louis Armstrong's habit of posing as a clown.
 ''I photographed him looking like the proud, great musician that he was,'' Mr. Gottlieb said.
 In 1941, he quit his advertising job to do graduate study in economics and teach low-level classes at the University of Maryland, but continued his column. He said he left the university after it refused to let him teach a course on jazz, for fear it would overly praise black people. He got a job at the Office of Price Administration.
 He was drafted into the Army Air Corps and served as a photo officer. He then worked as an editor and writer at Down Beat magazine, where he also continued taking pictures. He also published articles and photos in The Record Changer, The Saturday Review and Collier's.
 His photographs drew increasing attention. But he rejected his wife's suggestion that he focus completely on photography.
 In addition to her, Mr. Gottlieb is survived by his daughter, Barbara Gottlieb of Richmond, Va.; his sons Steven, of Chesapeake City, Md., Richard, of New Paltz, N.Y., and Edward, of Ithaca, N.Y.; six grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.
 The idea of a jazz photo book came from Fred Bass, a friend who owned the Strand bookstore in Manhattan. Mr. Gottlieb decided to use ''golden age'' in the title partly because of jazz's immense popularity in the 1940's, and partly because it was a time when almost all types of jazz, from the early New Orleans and Chicago styles to bebop, were being played simultaneously. 
 The faces of that evanescent era were etched permanently by Mr. Gottlieb and a handful of other photographers.
 ''Who is Billie Holiday? Look at Bill's shots,'' Jason Koransky, editor of Down Beat, said in an interview for an upcoming documentary. ''Who is Charlie Parker? Look at Bill's shots.''

HEADLINE: A Boycott for Immigrants' Rights Picks Up Support on Long Island

BYLINE: By PAUL VITELLO

DATELINE: HEMPSTEAD, N.Y., April 24 

 BODY:
In this Long Island village, where a third of the population is Hispanic and downtown sidewalks at lunchtime are fragrant with the smell of grilled fajitas and fried bananas, a group of business owners vowed yesterday to close their doors on Monday as part of a nationwide boycott in support of amnesty for the nation's 11 million illegal immigrants.
 One of the businessmen, Ivan Carmona, is an American citizen who said that he crossed into the United States illegally in 1980 because he could neither find work in his native Colombia nor obtain a visa to work here legally. 
 He became a citizen in 1986, after an immigration amnesty.
 ''I come across the river, and I was looking for the same opportunities the Italians and Chinese and Irish come here for,'' said Mr. Carmona, who began as a dishwasher in Manhattan.
 He worked as a carpenter, then started a construction business, and now shares ownership of a restaurant here, Pollos Mario, which he manages six days a week, opening the doors at 9 a.m. and closing them at midnight -- a 90-hour workweek that he will interrupt on Monday for the first time in the two-year life of the restaurant.
 ''We are not terrorists,'' he said. ''We must show we are here for working.''
 About 20 business owners made a call for a one-day boycott on the steps of Village Hall, standing under the American flag, the flag of Nassau County and the banner of the Workplace Project, an immigrant-advocate group.
 The boycott of commerce, work and school is intended to reflect the impact that immigrants have on the economy, they said, and to protest many of the harshest proposals under review in Congress for dealing with illegal immigrants.
 Not all immigrant advocates and leaders are supporting the boycott. Cardinal Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles, an outspoken advocate of rights for illegal immigrants, has cautioned against taking part in an action that he suggested might cause a public-opinion backlash.
 But here, and in a cluster of nearby communities that together form one of the hubs of Long Island's Hispanic population, there is an apparent consensus that without flexing its economic muscle, the immigrant community will lose the momentum some feel it has gained during the past weeks of demonstrations across the country.
 ''Our intention is to show those who write our laws that we value our workers in this land, a land made of immigrants,'' said Nelson Hernandez, the owner of a real estate company, Legacy Homes, who will join his 20 employees in showing support for a lenient approach to illegal immigrants.
 Chris Lopez, the manager of a wholesale grocery supplier, Jimenez Wholesale in Freeport, that supplies more than 300 small groceries and bodegas on Long Island, said that immigration reform was a matter of survival for businessmen like himself and his clients. 
 ''If they pass the worst bills, we could lose all our customers,'' he said. ''It's better to close for one day than to close forever.''
 Mr. Lopez came illegally to the United States in 1979 from the Dominican Republic. He said he earned his citizenship after marrying an American, the mother of his four children. ''One graduated just now from Stony Brook,'' he said. ''And the other three are going to go to college, too.''
 Under the harshest measures passed by the House of Representatives, but not included in the major bills before the Senate, it would be a felony to live in the United States without visa documents, an immigration status that is currently treated only as a violation of civil law.
 A Senate bill favored by immigration advocates, including the business owners who gathered yesterday, would permit most illegal immigrants to remain in the country legally, and to earn citizenship over time.
 ''For me, this is the best country,'' said Mr. Carmona, the co-owner of Pollos Mario, a two-story place with uniformed servers and $8 entrees that seem too much to eat in one sitting. ''It gives me a chance to work, and that is all I wanted.'' He, his wife and a 19-year-old daughter live in a rented house in Flushing, Queens, and hope to buy a home when they can afford it.
 Of his 32 employees, he said, about half are legal and the rest he cannot vouch for. ''When I need a dishwasher, I hire the guy who comes for the job,'' he said, leaving unsaid two facts of life in America as he knows them: Illegal immigrants often take jobs that others will not. And he was once one of them.

HEADLINE: In Miller's Spirit, Umpires Hold Line

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
MARVIN MILLER turned 89 last week and, in his ever-youthful state of mind, said, ''I'd be glad to help them in any way I could.''
 Miller, the players' renowned labor leader, was referring to minor league umpires, probably the most ill-treated group in baseball. Not many people are aware of it, but minor league umpires are on strike. They are on strike because the National Association, the umbrella organization of the minor leagues, refuses to pay a living wage.
The umpires could do nothing better for themselves than inflict Miller on their minor league bosses. Anybody who doesn't raise his employees' salaries for more than 10 years, then offers an additional $100 a month while raising health-plan premiums a commensurate amount, deserves Marvin Miller. 
 Miller, the former chief of the Major League Baseball Players Association, would be proud of the striking minor league umpires. The Association of Minor League Umpires has 220 members, and not one of them has worked this season.
 One of Miller's great strengths with major league players, besides getting their average salary raised to nearly $3 million from $19,000, was educating them on the importance of solidarity. Minor league umpires have not had the benefit of Miller's teaching, but they obviously have learned from his example. 
 On the other hand, minor league officials have made it easy for their umpires to be unified because of their insulting proposals for a new labor agreement to replace the five-year deal that expired Nov. 30. 
 ''We have to have a deal that makes sense for us economically,'' said Pat O'Conner, the National Association's chief operating officer and vice president of the Professional Baseball Umpire Corporation, a subsidiary.
 Under the expired contract, the umpires' pay went from $1,800 a month for short season (two and a half months) leagues to $3,400 a month for Class AAA (five months), the top tier in the minors. The minor leagues have offered a one-time $100-a-month raise at each level, meaning the top salary for umpires in the International and Pacific Coast Leagues would go to $17,500 from $17,000 for the length of a six-year contract. 
 The union proposed a larger increase, though not significantly so. It said it would accept the $100-a-month raise but wanted to phase in another $100 a month over the next three years of a four-year agreement. When minor league negotiators rejected that plan, the union shifted that $100 to per-diem payments. 
 The sides also disagree on per-diem payments, which have been $25, $22 and $20, depending on the minor league level. The employers offered to increase those meager numbers by $1 at each level in the first year, then to $40, $35 and $30 in the sixth year. The employees, applying the $100 they had proposed for additional salary increases, asked for $44, $39 and $34 in each year. 
 Considering how low the salaries are, per-diem payments are important for the umpires. They are on the road for the entire season, which means they are always eating in restaurants, riding in taxis and taking their clothes to be laundered.
 ''Their offers are insignificant to our membership,'' said Andy Roberts, the 32-year-old union president and an International League umpire. ''They want most of the increases later in the contract.''
 Speaking of the economic differences generally, Roberts said: ''This is a business that's growing and breaking attendance records. They haven't increased wages in over a decade. During that time, there was a pay freeze and a pay cut.''
 The sides differ in philosophy. The minor leagues believe that when an umpire is promoted, he is receiving a pay raise. The existing pay scale isn't intended to finance an umpire's career, because officials don't believe that minor league umpiring is a career. The idea of minor league umpiring, they feel, is to develop umpires for the major leagues. 
 Robert Weaver, a union lawyer from Birmingham, Ala., said that the umpires agreed with that aspect of their status, but Roberts said it was wrong not to think of what they did as a career.
 ''When you put your heart and soul into something for 10, 15 years, it's a career,'' said Roberts, who has been a minor league umpire for seven years. ''You do it in the hopes you can be fairly evaluated and make it to the major leagues.''
 And while the umpires are working toward that end, Weaver said, ''That doesn't mean these guys aren't entitled to a living wage.''
 Weaver added that minor league negotiators, at the first bargaining session, said they believed there was a pool of talent willing to work for what they were prepared to pay.'' But the 220 striking umpires are obviously not in that pool. 
 Negotiators will resume talks tomorrow in Cincinnati with the aid of a federal mediator, Lou Manchise. Meanwhile, replacement umpires, primarily from the college and junior college ranks, work minor league games. The major leagues have had this experience with none-too-satisfactory results.
 Major league umpires, who have issued a statement of support for their colleagues, planned to join minor league umpires on picket lines in Hagerstown, Md., today and in Lexington, Ky., on Saturday. And maybe the striking umpires will receive help from Miller. 
 ''The day I met Andy Roberts,'' Weaver said, ''I gave him Miller's autobiography and said: 'Read this. This is your model.' ''

HEADLINE: At U.S. Entries, No Welcome Mat

BYLINE: By Joe Sharkey. 
E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com

 BODY:
YOU hear a lot of chatter at travel conferences like the World Travel and Tourism Council's annual meeting, held recently in Washington. 
 But a business traveler from Germany got my attention when he described what travel to the United States could be like these days. ''At the airport, I was questioned very rudely for 20 minutes,'' he said. '' 'Who are you?' 'What are you doing here?' Before unification, I was treated better at the checkpoints going into East Germany.''
Whoa. What do we make of a foreign business traveler comparing his arrival in the United States with a pass through the surly gantlet at Checkpoint Charlie before the wall came down? 
 One thing became clear at this year's tourism council meeting, after all the happy proclamations about travel's global economic impact (leisure and business travel will account for more than $3 trillion in direct spending worldwide this year, for example). We have a problem, and Jay Rasulo, the chairman of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, addressed it in a speech to more than 500 representatives from the world's travel industry.
 ''The U.S. share of international travel has dropped double digits since 2000, and 35 percent since 1992,'' he said. ''Meanwhile, the global travel market is growing by leaps and bounds.''
 Mr. Rasulo suggested a marketing campaign on the scale of ''an Apollo project'' to sell the United States more effectively around the world. But even the cheery representative from the happy realm of Disney acknowledged the big fat Dumbo in the room: For many foreign travelers, entering the United States has become an unpleasant proposition.
 Even for residents of the relatively few countries where visas are not required, there is confusion about post-9/11 requirements for entry to the United States. ''The general takeaway is that the U.S. doesn't trust you,'' Mr. Rasulo said.
 Others at the conference addressed that perception, and the obviously delicate balance between security and accessibility. 
 ''We are emphatically behind the idea that we must in this country be full partners with the rest of the world in a robust and free-flowing pattern of travel and trade,'' said Michael Chertoff, the secretary of homeland security. 
 Homeland Security and the State Department earlier this year announced a joint initiative to do a better job in handling foreign visitors. 
 Some of that initiative has to be focused on the Middle East, one of the world's fastest-growing travel markets, said Maurice Flanagan, the vice chairman of Emirates Group, owner of Emirates Airlines, based in Dubai. He said the United States had developed a ''blind spot'' and put too many obstacles in front of travelers from Arab countries. ''The Arab travel market is very large, very first class and growing very fast,'' he said.
 Added Thomas J. Donohue, the chief executive of the United States Chamber of Commerce, ''If you want to do business with the Arab world, you have to go to London.'' 
 The government is working to address the growing demand for air travel while improving security, partly with the creation of a technology-based air travel system called NextGen, said Norman Y. Mineta, secretary of transportation. The system is still on the drawing boards.
 ''Imagine how much more attractive travel will be in a future with virtually no flight delays, where a pilot can choose the most direct route around weather and congestion, saving hours of time and millions of gallons of jet fuel,'' Mr. Mineta said. 
 ''I see the NextGen initiative,'' he said, ''as having greater implications for travel tourism and commerce than any other transportation project undertaken by the United States government since creating the Interstate Highway System in 1956.''
 Let's end with a report on the conference's dinner, sponsored by Disney. Engraved invitations to the ''magical evening'' went out to all attendees, including reporters from around the world. The media were shunted to a loading dock out back and assembled out of sight in a holding pen set off from the ballroom by a high blue curtain.
 ''Security,'' the loading dock guard explained. 
 The previous afternoon, I had wandered over to the mall to witness a big pro-immigration demonstration. At the dinner the next night, I couldn't help but notice that the waiters and bartenders, nearly all of whom appeared to be Latino, wore brightly colored Mickey Mouse hats.
 ''They said we had to,'' one waiter explained. 
 It's a small world after all.

HEADLINE: Pessimism About U.S. as Trade Talks Miss Deadline

BYLINE: By KATRIN BENNHOLD and JAMES KANTER; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: PARIS, April 24 

 BODY:
The head of the World Trade Organization formally abandoned a deadline of April 30 for progress in world trade talks, saying that all sides needed to move. 
 Speaking in Geneva, the official, Pascal Lamy, director general of the W.T.O., said the advanced economies had to overcome their reluctance to expose their farmers to competition and the developing nations had to reduce their barriers to Western manufactured goods and services.
The differences, Mr. Lamy said, were still too wide to justify calling in trade ministers to try to pin down a preliminary agreement, despite the April 30 deadline. 
 ''It is not good news, but we have to face reality,'' he said.
 But all sides insisted that a deal by the end of the year remained their goal, not least to improve trading conditions for developing countries.
 ''We have a missed deadline, but we have no deadlock,'' Mr. Lamy said. He did not go into details on why the deadline was missed, but many trade experts agreed that the major negotiating countries had so far declined to put all their cards on the table. Still, some experts said, global trade deals have tended to be clinched just as American presidential negotiating authority expires, in this case in 2007.
 ''I don't think it's good news for the round,'' Mr. Lamy said, ''but I don't think either that we should cry over the missed deadline.'' He refused to set another target date, but said, ''July is too late.''
 Peter Mandelson, the European Union's chief trade negotiator, has turned up the heat on the United States in recent days, suggesting that Washington was the biggest obstacle to a deal.
 Two recent events set off alarms in Europe about the United States' commitment to international trade talks. One occurred when Representative Bill Thomas, Republican of California and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, urged the Bush administration three weeks ago to focus its energy on agreements with individual nations, instead of the global trade round. 
 Then last week, President Bush announced that he had decided to name Rob Portman, the United States trade representative, as budget director. Mr. Bush said he wanted to replace Mr. Portman with his deputy, Susan Schwab. 
 Mr. Mandelson, after a meeting Monday with Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin of France, said his biggest concern was that Congress might extend the 2002 farm bill, which would prolong agricultural supports that the Europeans and several developing countries are asking the United States to curb. ''If Congress decided to do this,'' Mr. Mandelson said, ''it would throw the whole negotiations into doubt.''
 A spokeswoman for the office of the United States trade representative, Christin Baker, said the United States was ''actively engaged on both the multilateral and the bilateral fronts'' when it comes to trade. ''Our commitment to the global trade round,'' she added, ''is unwavering.''
 Washington and European officials in Brussels are at odds over a number of commercial issues. One is a continuing dispute over subsidies to aircraft makers that has overshadowed the global competition for orders between Boeing and Airbus. 
 Another is a finding by a World Trade Organization panel in February that the United States was still not in compliance with a 2001 ruling that declared tax breaks offered to companies including Microsoft, Boeing and General Electric to be illegal. That finding allows the European Union to reimpose sanctions on American imports as early as mid-May.
 European trade officials cited a number of political factors that they said risked sapping any enthusiasm in the United States for further concessions on farm subsidies. These included a rising tide of protectionist sentiment among members of Congress of both parties, a weakened Bush administration and the Congressional elections in November.
 Mr. Mandelson declined to say what he thought the new deadline for trade talks should be, but noted that there will be election campaigns in major countries in the months ahead. Brazil, for instance, has presidential elections in October, and France's presidential and legislative balloting is to occur next spring.
 Adding to the pressure has been the mid-2007 expiration of the Bush administration's trade negotiating authority, which obliges Congress to accept or reject any trade deal as a package, without being able to contest individual parts.
 ''All these things are harder to do the longer we leave them,'' he said.

HEADLINE: What Price Loyalty? Something Free

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
TOM PLASKETT was sitting on a flight from Boston to Dallas one day in 1980 with a problem that needed solving.
 At 36 years old, Mr. Plaskett had just inherited the top marketing job at American Airlines from the famously intense Robert L. Crandall, who had become the company president. Mr. Crandall, like hundreds of other executives before and since, was looking for a way to keep customers loyal to his company.
 The problem was that the federal government had recently deregulated his industry, freeing airlines to compete with each other on price. If the only way to ensure loyalty was to buy it with cheap fares, Mr. Crandall knew that American was in trouble. It fell to Mr. Plaskett and his team to get travelers to buy tickets on American even when it wasn't offering the lowest fare. 
 As he thought about what kept people coming back to the same company, his mind wandered to the kitchen of his childhood home in Raytown, Mo., where he would sit with his mother and lick S&H Green Stamps. The stamps had come from the local grocery store as a reward for shopping there, and when the Plasketts had pasted enough of them in a book, they took it to an S&H redemption center to claim a prize.
 One time it was a toaster. Another time it was a vacuum cleaner. They weren't the most exciting items -- nothing as alluring as, say, a Hawaiian vacation -- but they were enough to tether the Plaskett family to that grocery store.
 ''It was the idea of getting something for nothing, really,'' he said. ''So I began thinking, 'Why wouldn't that work for the airlines?' ''
 Over the next year, Mr. Crandall, Mr. Plaskett and their colleagues developed a secret plan modeled on green stamps, a surprise intended to catch their rivals off guard. On May 1, 1981 -- 25 years ago next Monday -- they unveiled a program called AAdvantage. Frequent-flier miles were born.
 MILES have become one of the most successful business ideas not just of the last quarter-century but in the modern history of capitalism. They have been a diabolically brilliant way to separate people from their money while making them feel as if they were instead getting a gift. Sure, you just spent $800 fixing your car, but you charged it to a credit card that awards miles, putting you that much closer to a free vacation.
 If you believe the popular idea that a mile is worth about a cent, the 14 trillion unredeemed miles that travelers hold are more valuable than all of the United States currency in circulation, as The Economist magazine has noted. 
 That does not include the points racked up in the many copycat programs. At my local Tex-Mex place, I'm a member of the frequent-burrito-eating club.
 ''We figured if we were successful,'' Mr. Crandall told me this week, ''we could replace S&H Green Stamps.''
 They have obviously done that, and then some. But the comparison also has a darker side. Green stamps, after all, aren't around anymore. They were the victim of their own inflationary spiral in the 1960's, when stores started awarding double and triple stamps, which cost them gobs of money. 
 Soon, some store managers realized that they could offer eye-catching discounts instead, said Joseph C. Nunes, a marketing professor at the University of Southern California. About the only place to find the stamps these days is in Andy Warhol art (though S&H is trying to revive them online).
 They were another example of the notion that corporate America tends to drive every good idea into the ground like a tomato stake, as the writer James Grant has said about Wall Street. Now frequent-flier miles are following a similar path.
 They caught on because they did such a wonderful job of exploiting human nature. From his own experience with green stamps, Mr. Plaskett knew that collecting stickers or points could feel like an accomplishment in itself. So, American Airlines deliberately handed out thousands of them at once, because ''10,000 miles'' sounded a lot more impressive than ''6 flight segments.'' 
 The company made miles flown the unit of currency, instead of dollars spent, to reduce the chances that businesses would try to claim the awards from their employees. Business travelers, after all, were the ones deciding which airline to fly, even if their employers were picking up the bill. Frequent-flier miles became a little kickback.
 Best of all, the ultimate prizes -- vacations -- were just the sort of thing to induce daydreaming. Yet they cost American almost nothing, because the company was careful to give away seats that otherwise would have gone unfilled.
 No wonder, then, that United Airlines copied American within days and every other big airline soon followed. 
 Just as they were intended to do, the programs delayed the march of low-fare carriers. One study done in the 1990's found that business travelers taking a 1,000-mile trip would pay an extra $170 on average to fly on the airline with their frequent-flier program.
 But I'd bet you wouldn't find the same premium today. Low-fare airlines are a lot bigger than they used to be, and they have their own frequent-flier programs. Corporate travel managers, meanwhile, can use software to force business travelers to choose the cheapest ticket.
 And miles don't have the pull they once did, because they, too, have been swept up into an inflationary spiral. Hard-core travelers who once viewed upgrades to first class as an inalienable right now find them hard to come by because so many miles are sloshing around and planes are so full these days. Claiming free tickets on popular routes can also seem almost impossible. 
 Frequent-flier programs are not about to disappear, because no airline can afford to abandon them unilaterally. But compared with Mr. Crandall's original goal -- to keep airline seats from becoming a commodity -- the frequent-flier mile is looking pretty old and tired for a 25-year-old.
 Just look at what United is doing to celebrate the 25th anniversary of its program. It is letting its best customers use their miles to buy Callaway Golf clubs, Coach sunglasses and Canon digital cameras. That turns frequent-flier miles into just another discount, rather than the guarantee of loyalty that Mr. Plaskett envisioned.

HEADLINE: DEVELOPER TAKES A FINANCIAL DEAL FOR GROUND ZERO

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The developer Larry A. Silverstein announced yesterday that he had accepted the economic terms of a new deal at ground zero. The proposal reduces his overall role on the 16-acre site and clears the way for construction of the Freedom Tower, the tallest and most symbolically important of five towers planned for the site.
 The deal calls for Mr. Silverstein to surrender control of the $2 billion Freedom Tower, along with more than one third of the ground zero site, to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. But he would retain the right to build three office towers on the most valuable parcels there.
Mr. Silverstein's announcement came six days after officials from the Pataki, Corzine and Bloomberg administrations presented the developer with a unified, take-it-or-leave-it offer in an attempt to end four months of frustrating and politically embarrassing struggle over the future of the World Trade Center site. 
 ''This is about rebuilding; New York has waited too long,'' Mr. Silverstein, who is 74, said in a news conference in front of 7 World Trade Center, a 52-story skyscraper he recently rebuilt just north of ground zero. ''Make no mistake, we have made concessions. All the finger-pointing must stop. We must all work together to achieve our vital mission.''
 Officials say that the agreement should spark corporate interest in the downtown business district and eliminate much of the uncertainty that executives say has hampered the resurgence of Lower Manhattan. The Port Authority board is expected to approve the conceptual framework for the deal at its meeting today, although it would not close until September.
 After the news conference, Port Authority executives spoke to Mr. Silverstein, who leased the trade center six weeks before it was destroyed on 9/11, to resolve several relatively minor outstanding issues. They said that they hoped he would sign the agreement today before the board meeting. ''Nothing would make us happier than to see such an important step forward,'' Bud Perrone, a spokesman for Silverstein Properties, said last night.
 But the turmoil at ground zero will not disappear completely. Rebuilding officials expect that the focus will now shift from commercial development at ground zero to what many regard as the cornerstone of ground zero, the troubled memorial project. 
 Consultants are expected to deliver a report in the next week showing that the cost of the memorial and a museum has swelled to as much as $800 million from $500 million. But until now, fund-raising has been sluggish at best. Gov. George E. Pataki's senior adviser for counter-terrorism has also raised concerns about security at the site.
 The agreement at ground zero provides for the Port Authority to contribute $100 million to the memorial. But the projected cost of the memorial is now so high that planners may have to pare elements of the project, potentially touching off another round of squabbling. 
 Business groups like the Alliance for Downtown New York and the Partnership for New York City greeted yesterday's announcement with a sigh of relief. ''This is a shot in the arm for Lower Manhattan,'' said Eric Deutsch, president of the alliance. ''It removes the uncertainty and allows businesses to make long-term decisions to invest and relocate downtown.''
 Yesterday, Mr. Silverstein, who has long insisted that he is the best person to rebuild ground zero, put the best face on what amounted to a capitulation. The developer, who has a penchant for endless negotiations, failed to come to terms on March 14, a deadline set by Governor Pataki. He is now agreeing to a far less generous deal; he acknowledged yesterday that he had had to make additional concessions.
 In recent weeks, he was described as ''greedy'' by Charles A. Gargano, vice chairman of the Port Authority and New York's top economic development official, even as Mr. Silverstein complained about bargaining with rival government entities that, until recently, could not agree among themselves.
 Mr. Silverstein pointedly chose to hold the news conference in front of his new office tower, the only one rebuilt at ground zero, noting that government had failed to rebuild other parts of the site. In responding to the government's latest offer, he said, ''In four business days, we did what it took government four months to accomplish.'' But, ultimately, he sued for peace.
 ''The plan of last week recognizes the unique public nature of this project and will ensure that the rebuilding moves forward expeditiously and with certainty,'' Governor Pataki said yesterday. ''The plan will make certain that the rebuilt World Trade Center will anchor the financial capital of the world and make our nation proud.''
 Mr. Pataki, who has tied his legacy and his political ambitions to the Freedom Tower, can also claim victory, in that it appears that work can now proceed more quickly at ground zero. Mr. Silverstein will be paid a 1 percent fee to build the tower under the supervision of the Port Authority. 
 ''Once he signs the agreement, Silverstein told us he can start building the Freedom Tower within a matter of days,'' Mr. Gargano said. ''We're hopeful that will happen.''
 The announcement can also be seen as a victory for Anthony R. Coscia, the chairman of the Port Authority, and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who effectively blocked a prior attempt by the Pataki administration to strike a deal with Mr. Silverstein. They feared that those agreements would have enriched the developer, while shifting most of the potential risk to the public.
 Mr. Bloomberg repeatedly said that Mr. Silverstein did not have enough money to complete the $7 billion project. He raised the possibility that the developer would run out of money in 2009 after building only two towers, default on his lease and walk away with tens of millions in profits, while the project was left unfinished. 
 ''It's not productive to look backwards,'' Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff said yesterday. ''We all need to look forward and ensure that the goals we share of building out the site are achieved quickly and completely.''
 Under the proposed deal, Mr. Silverstein is surrendering control of the Freedom Tower and a second site, Tower 5, to the Port Authority. Tower 5 will probably be sold to a residential developer. To put the Freedom Tower on a sound financial footing, the Pataki administration has pledged to contribute $250 million and round up a million square feet of leases, most likely with federal agencies. The leases would allow the authority to get a mortgage, which, combined with $970 million in insurance proceeds, would cover most of the estimated cost of the building.
 Mr. Silverstein, in turn, would develop three office towers along Church Street, between Vesey and Liberty Streets. Construction could begin as soon as the authority completes the foundations on the eastern edge of the site, sometime next year. 
 To ensure that he can obtain mortgage money and build quickly, the city and the authority have offered to lease 1.2 million square feet of space in what is known as Tower 4. But the developer's fee would be limited to 2.5 percent, not the 5 percent he at first demanded.
 In the coming days and weeks, the authority would work with Mr. Silverstein to design the shopping mall that is to be built in the base of two of the Church Street towers. Later, Mr. Silverstein would have the option of buying the retail part of the project from the authority.

HEADLINE: Lawmaker and Beneficiary Bought a Farm

BYLINE: By JODI RUDOREN; Aron Pilhofer and Ron Nixon contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Representative Alan B. Mollohan, the West Virginia Democrat who stepped down from the House ethics committee last week over accusations of financial improprieties, bought a $900,000 farm last year with a lifelong friend whose business he has supported with special federal appropriations known as earmarks.
 Mr. Mollohan acknowledged yesterday that he had on several occasions steered earmarks to federal agencies to finance contracts with his friend's company, FMW Composite Systems. He said that he could not recall all the specifics, but that the earmarks included $2.1 million to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in late 2004 for a space shuttle and $2.3 million to the Marine Corps for tank fuel bladders. 
 But Mr. Mollohan said that he was not FMW's only ''Congressional sponsor'' and that he saw no conflict of interest between his personal real estate purchase and the company's federal contracts. 
 ''The test for funding programs that companies are participating in is the same for everyone; the test is whether it's a good project and what it means for employment and economic development in West Virginia,'' said Mr. Mollohan, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee and its subcommittee that finances the space agency. ''Friendship has nothing to do with my support for any government program.''
 Mr. Mollohan's financial dealings with FMW's chief executive, Dale R. McBride, were first reported on Tuesday by The Wall Street Journal. 
 In a telephone interview, Mr. Mollohan said he and Mr. McBride had a 50-50 ownership of the 300-acre farm near Parsons, W.Va., and of its $800,000 mortgage.
 ''A conflict assumes that you are benefiting from that relationship in an inappropriate way, and that's just not the case,'' he said. ''I'm benefiting to the extent of my ownership, and that benefit is totally reliant on my asset.''
 Mr. McBride is one of three of Mr. Mollohan's real estate partners who have received federal contracts or earmarks, which is a major aspect of a 500-page complaint that the conservative National Legal and Policy Center filed with the United States attorney's office challenging Mr. Mollohan's finances. 
 Over the past three years, Mr. Mollohan and his wife have bought five empty lots with Laura Kurtz Kuhns and her husband on Bald Head Island, N.C., where the two couples have side-by-side oceanfront vacation homes that they rent out. Ms. Kuhns, a former aide in Mr. Mollohan's Washington office, is the director of the Vandalia Heritage Foundation, one of five nonprofit organizations Mr. Mollohan founded and then financed with $250 million in earmarks since 1999.
 The Mollohans are also co-owners of 27 condominiums with Rosemary and Joseph Jarvis Jr., who is a third cousin of the congressman and had a Department of Energy contract in the mid-1990's. 
 The House ethics manual does not specifically address such private real estate investments, but cautions against members' accepting benefits or making ''pecuniary gains'' that could be perceived as connected to their official duties.
 The West Virginia farm is one of eight parcels Mr. Mollohan owns in Tucker County, where Vandalia and two of the other nonprofit organizations have been active. Mr. Mollohan and Mr. McBride said they had been searching for years for a farm like the one owned by Mr. Mollohan's parents, where they had baled hay and chased cattle as children.
 ''It's a place for us to get away where cellphones don't work and fish bite and beer stays cold,'' Mr. McBride said of the spread along the Cheat River that they bought from a former FMW executive's widow.
 Mr. McBride serves on the board of one of the Mollohan-created nonprofit agencies, MountainMade, which helps local artisans sell their wares. He gave $12,700 to Mr. Mollohan's campaign and political action committees between 1997 and this February. He is also among the organizers of a Mollohan-backed effort to create a bank in his district specializing in loans to high-technology companies, whose investors include two of the nonprofit agencies.
 FMW Composite Systems was founded in 1993 by Mr. McBride, an Army veteran and a lawyer who previously worked in the coal industry, a tire business and a real estate brokerage. It is privately held, and Mr. McBride would not disclose its annual revenue, but said ''a fair portion'' of the business was in federal contracts.
 Records show the company as having received $2.9 million in seven contracts from the Navy and the Air Force in 2004. 
 In 2002, FMW got a $619,000 subcontract from the Institute for Scientific Research -- another Mollohan-created earmark beneficiary -- for a NASA project known as the Super Lightweight Interchangeable Carrier, developing a new pallet to carry tools and materials inside the space shuttle. FMW continued to get NASA contracts for the carrier for several years, including $1.5 million in 2005 from Mr. Mollohan's $2.1 million earmark. 
 ''Congressman Mollohan was briefed on the program by us, yes,'' Mr. McBride said, adding that his company delivered the new pallet, weighing 1,800 pounds instead of the old one's 3,800, in July, 2005. ''Yes, he's been helpful, of course, but in terms of the numbers of programs or numbers of dollars that he's provided to various programs, he's not the largest, by far.''
 Mr. Mollohan said Tuesday that the potential conflict of interest ''did not occur to me'' when buying the farm with Mr. McBride. Asked whether any other real estate partners had federal contracts, he said his brother, Robert H. Mollohan, with whom he inherited the Ramada Inn in Morgantown, W.Va., ''mows lawns'' for military reserve units around the state.
 ''I had absolutely nothing to do with it,'' Mr. Mollohan said of his brother's contracts, adding that he did not even know the name of the landscaping company. ''Robert got that all on his own.''

HEADLINE: Russia, Rich in Wells, Aims to Buy Into the Retail Side of Oil and Gas 

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

DATELINE: MOSCOW, April 25 

 BODY:
Just a couple of years ago, Russia's big energy companies hardly ventured outside the former Soviet Union. These days, they are trying to horse-trade on a global scale, swapping stakes in their giant oil and gas fields for ports, pipelines and networks of gas stations around the world. 
 Executives streaming in from China, Israel and India are lining up outside Gazprom's headquarters, hoping for a piece of Russia's natural gas reserves.
But the company's accounts -- and indeed those of the government, too -- are already flooded with petrodollars. So, the Russian government and its oil and natural gas operators want to swap for something else: they want to build large retail networks to reach consumers in the United States, Europe and China. 
 Already, a blueprint is emerging under which state and private companies trade a stake in Russian oil and natural gas projects for a role in overseas expansion. 
 Two major energy deals are under negotiation in Moscow. Gazprom is seeking to trade access to its Russian reserves for a chance to help build or gain a stake in terminals for liquefied natural gas, or L.N.G., in the United States. And Rosneft, the state oil company, wants to build a network of gas stations in China. 
 In the deals, analysts see the larger ambitions of Russia as a power broker in the worldwide energy markets, with the power to dictate terms to companies like Chevron or BP, and the range to sell energy products directly to consumers in the United States. Russia's crude oil reserves are the largest outside OPEC, if Canadian tar sands are not counted as oil reserves, and Russia's natural gas reserves are the largest in the world. 
 ''There's the spirit that it is morning again in Russia,'' Thane Gustafson, a senior analyst at Cambridge Energy Research Associates, said of Russia's oil and gas companies in a telephone interview. ''Stand tall in the saddle. And what is the one thing the Russians have in hand as a trump card? They have energy resources and location.''
 Situated 550 kilometers, or 330 miles, north of Murmansk in the Barents Sea, the Shtokman gas field is well positioned for exports to the Eastern Seaboard of the United States and is expected to be the object of the largest energy deal to close in Russia this year. Gazprom is in the final stages of choosing partners; it had said it would disclose them this week but has delayed the announcement. In any case, entry will not be cheap: the initial investment is likely to exceed $10 billion. 
 The prize is a minority stake in a reserve of 3.6 trillion cubic meters, or about 127 trillion cubic feet, of natural gas, equivalent to seven times the annual consumption of European Union member states. 
 In September, Gazprom announced a short list of possible partners, including Chevron and ConocoPhillips of the United States, Norsk Hydro and Statoil of Norway, and Total of France. But the negotiations are not all about money, say bankers and energy executives involved. A chief aim for Gazprom is to use domestic reserves to build its international profile. 
 For example, Total, a long-shot contender according to analysts, offered to trade Gazprom its stakes in a Norwegian offshore field and prepaid rights to capacity at the Sabine Pass L.N.G. terminal in Cameron Parish, La., for a role in Shtokman, Reuters reported. 
 Gazprom's ambitions to expand overseas have a political as well as commercial dimension, so it is not surprising that Russian officials endorse Gazprom's strategy of reciprocity as it expands into Europe and even the United States and Asia. After all, Western companies have tried to enter the Russian market for a decade. 
 Commercially, Gazprom could increase its margins by selling at retail rather than wholesale. In Europe, retail prices range from 1.9 times wholesale prices in France to 6.7 times in Denmark, according to a study by Goldman Sachs. Retail sales prices are higher, of course, to cover the additional costs of building and maintaining distribution networks. Gazprom's wholesale revenues in Europe last year were more than $25 billion. 
 Similarly, Gazprom is pushing American companies to help Russia ensure access to American pipelines for the eventual exports from Shtokman, according to an American banker who has sat in on talks between the Russian company and Chevron. 
 That could be a delicate task after Congress gave a chilly reception to Middle Eastern and Chinese foreign investors recently. Two high-profile bids by foreign companies to buy United States assets failed. The China National Offshore Oil Corporation withdrew its bid for Unocal, the oil company based in California, and DP World of Dubai aborted efforts to own port terminals. Gazprom could be hoping an American partner could ease its entry into the United States. 
 Indeed, analysts say the reluctance -- or inability -- of the American partners to help Gazprom enter the American market may be holding up the talks. Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Gazprom have declined to comment. 
 In a sign of high-level government interest in the big energy deal, William J. Burns, the American ambassador to Russia, met last week with Gazprom's chief executive, Aleksei B. Miller. 
 In a related dispute, Mr. Miller met with European Union ambassadors in Moscow the same week and warned that attempts to thwart Gazprom's expansion into Europe would only impel the company to turn to eager buyers in Asia instead. 
 ''Attempts to limit Gazprom's activities in the European market and politicize questions of gas supply, which are in fact entirely economic, will not lead to good results,'' Gazprom said in a statement issued after the meeting.
 ''This may be controversial, but recent examples in the United States make Russia look not all bad'' in terms of economic protectionism, said Peter Westin, chief economist at MDM Bank in Moscow. 
 Another keenly awaited energy deal this year is the expected initial public offering of stock in Rosneft. Rosneft is also in talks with Chinese companies over opening a network of filling stations in China in exchange for a 5 to 10 percent stake in Rosneft, according to Aleksei N. Kormschikov, an oil and gas analyst at the UralSib brokerage firm in Moscow.
 This move would smooth Rosneft's entry into China, ensuring a customer for Russian energy outside Europe and the United States. Rosneft's capitalization is estimated at about $60 billion, making the expected Chinese share worth about $3 billion to $6 billion. 
 The big globe-spanning swaps have a precedent in recent deals. The Russian company Lukoil's strategic partnership in 2004 with ConocoPhillips, the third-largest United States oil operator after Exxon Mobil and Chevron, allowed Conoco access to reserves in the far north and access to a private terminal on the Arctic Ocean at Varandey Bay. 
 In turn, Conoco agreed to help Lukoil retain its production-sharing agreement in the huge West Qurna-2 field in Iraq. Lukoil said this week that it was pleased with the partnership and believed that a final agreement with Iraqi authorities guaranteeing Lukoil control over the field near Basra was near.

HEADLINE: BUSH TAKES STEPS TO STEM INCREASE IN ENERGY PRICES

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER; David D. Kirkpatrick contributed reporting from Washington for this article, and Jad Mouawad from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 25 

 BODY:
President Bush announced a series of short-term steps on Tuesday intended to ease the rise in energy prices, including a suspension of government purchases to refill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a relaxation of environmental rules for the formulation of gasoline and investigations into possible price gouging and price fixing.
 In addressing energy prices in a speech here, Mr. Bush joined a chorus of lawmakers who have been advocating populist-sounding initiatives to respond to surges in gasoline and crude oil prices and the threat they pose to Republicans in this fall's Congressional elections. 
Mr. Bush did not go as far as some members of his party, who are floating the possibility of a ''windfall profits'' tax on oil companies. But, speaking as the major oil companies prepared to report their quarterly earnings this week, he said he was directing the Justice Department to join with an existing Federal Trade Commission inquiry into possible price manipulation. 
 Mr. Bush urged oil companies to reinvest their profits in expanding refining capacity and in developing alternative energy sources. And he called for the reversal of relatively small tax breaks and incentives for oil companies engaging in specific types of exploration. Those perks were in an energy bill Mr. Bush signed into law last year. 
 He also called for an expansion of the tax break consumers get for buying hybrid cars, which combine gasoline and battery power, a move that could benefit two major Japanese-owned manufacturers, Toyota and Honda, which have led the market. 
 The rise in energy prices has undermined the administration's effort to build a case that its policies have led to economic prosperity and has given Democrats an opening to portray the White House and Congressional Republicans as allies of the oil industry. With Mr. Bush's poll numbers sagging and his party on the defensive over the Iraq war, Republicans have been scrambling to show they are trying to help consumers.
 Republican strategists said the anticorporate undertone of the Republican response carried the risk of a backlash from business leaders and free-market conservatives who deplore government intervention. But they said the risk was relatively small at a time when both parties want to promise voters relief.
 ''I think there are a lot of people in the business community who are saying that to some degree, the oil industry brought some of this criticism on itself,'' said David Winston, a Republican pollster, noting recent headlines about the $400 million in compensation that Lee R. Raymond received in his last year as chairman of Exxon Mobil. 
 Oil prices are hovering around $73 dollars a barrel, and consumers are paying more than $3 a gallon for gasoline in places. The sharp price increase in recent weeks has been driven by several factors, including concern about a confrontation with Iran, one of the world's largest oil suppliers. 
 At various points, Iran has threatened -- and withdrawn the threat -- to slow production if the United Nations Security Council imposes sanctions against it for its nuclear enrichment program, which the United States says is part of a secret weapons program. Mr. Bush alluded to the issue in his speech, saying for the first time that some countries were playing on what he termed America's ''addiction'' to oil, adding, ''that reduces our influence'' in the world.
 Mr. Bush said the decision by the Clinton administration not to permit oil production in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge was costing the United States more than one million barrels a day of lost production. 
 The investigation into possible price manipulation that Mr. Bush said the Federal Trade Commission was conducting began in August 2005, around the time Hurricane Katrina struck. The trade commission said Tuesday that the results of that initial investigation would be announced in May, and that for the past four years it had been reviewing prices in several markets. 
 Mr. Bush also said he had ordered some short-term steps, mostly involving the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. He gave American oil companies more time to pay back emergency loans taken from the reserve after the production disruptions of the last hurricane season. The Energy Department says the reserve has 688 million barrels in hand; it has room for 727 million barrels. The oil company paybacks would amount to a little over two million barrels.
 ''Our strategic reserve is sufficiently large enough to guard against any major supply disruption over the next few months,'' Mr. Bush said. ''So by deferring deposits until the fall, we'll leave a little more oil on the market.'' 
 Oil experts, though, said that these steps were small ones, and that Mr. Bush's ability to affect gasoline prices was limited.
 For the longer term, Mr. Bush said he was asking Congress to repeal $2 billion in tax breaks and incentives in last year's energy bill. White House officials said he had never advocated the incentives for the oil industry. 
 Mr. Bush suggested expanding the tax break for buying hybrids, which are more expensive than gasoline-powered cars, but which look more attractive to consumers today than they did a year ago. The break diminishes as soon as more than 60,000 units of any individual hybrid model are sold, but on Tuesday, Mr. Bush pressed to eliminate that ceiling. 
 On Capitol Hill, Republicans accused the Democrats of blocking legislation to increase energy supplies by increasing domestic nuclear power and oil drilling. Democrats said Mr. Bush and Republicans in Congress had failed to address the short-term cost of gas in the energy bill passed last year, and they dismissed the president's call for an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission as a toothless ploy. 
 Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, said the party planned to introduce amendments about gasoline prices in the pending bill for spending for Iraq. The party's priority, Democrats said, is an amendment proposed by Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, to suspend the federal sales tax on gasoline for 60 days and pay for the shortfall by changing rules to increase the taxes on oil companies. 
 Many parts of the country have been experiencing high gasoline prices as refiners are scrambling to switch to an ethanol-blended gasoline instead of using MTBE. Refiners have decided to drop MTBE, a popular oxygen additive but one that has been blamed for water pollution. 
 The rapid shift has created vast logistical challenges, mainly because of ethanol shortages and the difficulties linked to transporting it.

PERSON: Jane Jacobs

HEADLINE: Jane Jacobs, 89, Who Saw Future In Cities, Is Dead

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Jane Jacobs, the writer and thinker who brought penetrating eyes and ingenious insight to the sidewalk ballet of her own Greenwich Village street and came up with a book that challenged and changed the way people view cities, died yesterday in Toronto, where she moved in 1968. She was 89. 
 She died at a Toronto hospital, said a distant cousin, Lucia Jacobs, who gave no specific cause of death.
In her book ''The Death and Life of Great American Cities,'' written in 1961, Ms. Jacobs's enormous achievement was to transcend her own withering critique of 20th-century urban planning and propose radically new principles for rebuilding cities. 
 At a time when both common and inspired wisdom called for bulldozing slums and opening up city space, Ms. Jacobs's prescription was ever more diversity, density and dynamism -- in effect, to crowd people and activities together in a joyous urban jumble.
 Her critique of the nation's cities is often grouped with the work of writers who in the 1960's shook the foundations of American society: Paul Goodman's attack on schooling; Michael Harrington's stark portrait of poverty; Ralph Nader's barrage against the auto industry; and Malcolm X's grim tour of America's racial divide, among others. And it continues to influence a third generation of students.
 ''Death and Life'' made four basic recommendations for creating municipal diversity: 1. A street or district must serve several primary functions. 2. Blocks must be short. 3. Buildings must vary in age, condition and use. 4. Population must be dense.
 Ms. Jacobs's thesis was enlarged by her deep, eclectic reading. But most compelling was her description of the everyday life she witnessed from her home above a candy store at 555 Hudson Street, near 11th Street.
 In that description, she puts out her garbage, children go to school, the dry cleaner and the barber open their shops, women come out to chat, longshoremen visit the local bar, teenagers return from school and change to go out on dates, and another day is played out. Sometimes, odd things happen: a bagpiper shows up on a February night, and delighted listeners gather around. Whether neighbors or strangers, people are safer because they are almost never alone.
 ''People who know well such animated city streets will know how it is,'' Ms. Jacobs wrote. ''I am afraid people who do not will always have it a little wrong in their heads, like the old prints of rhinoceroses made from travelers' descriptions of rhinoceroses.''
 Robert Caro, the historian, said in an interview yesterday that Ms. Jacobs was far from the first urban theorist to stress the importance of neighborhood and community. ''But no one had ever said it so brilliantly before,'' he said. ''She gave voice to something that needed a voice.''
 Some critics used adjectives like ''triumphant'' and ''seminal'' to describe ''Death and Life.'' Others, not a few of whom with an ax to grind, were less kind. Lewis Mumford, the critic and social historian whom Ms. Jacobs eviscerated in the book, suggested in a review in The New Yorker that she had displayed ''aesthetic philistinism with a vengeance.''
 The battles she ignited are still being fought, and the criticism was perhaps inevitable, given that such an ambitious work was produced by somebody who had not finished college, much less become an established professional in the field.
 Indisputably, the book was as radically challenging to conventional thinking as Rachel Carson's ''Silent Spring,'' which helped engender the environmental movement, would be the next year, and Betty Friedan's ''The Feminine Mystique,'' which deeply affected perceptions of relations between the sexes, would be in 1963.
 Like those two writers, Ms. Jacobs was able to summon a freshness of perspective. Some dismissed it as amateurism, but to many others it was a point of view that made new ideas not only thinkable but suddenly and eminently reasonable.
 ''When an entire field is headed in the wrong direction, when the routine application of mainstream thinking has produced disastrous results as I think was true of planning and urban policy in the 1950's, then it probably took someone from outside to point out the obvious,'' Alan Ehrenhalt wrote in 2001 in Planning, the magazine of the American Planning Association.
 ''That is what Jane Jacobs did 40 years ago,'' he said. 

Action, Not Just Words
 Ms. Jacobs did not limit her impact to words. In 1961, she and other protestors were removed from a City Planning Commission hearing on an urban renewal plan for Greenwich Village that they opposed, after they leapt from their seats and rushed the podium.
 In 1968, she was arrested on riot and criminal mischief charges for disrupting a public meeting on the construction of an expressway that would have sliced across Lower Manhattan and displaced hundreds of families and businesses. The police said she had tried to tear up the stenographer's transcript tape. 
 The battle against that highway pitted Ms. Jacobs in an uphill fight against Robert Moses, the autocratic and immensely powerful master builder of that era. The expressway's opponents won. 
 Ms. Jacobs moved to Toronto in 1968 out of opposition to the Vietnam War and to shield her two draft-age sons from military duty, and quickly enlisted in Toronto's urban battles. No sooner had she arrived than she led a battle to stop a freeway there.
 She became a beloved intellectual pioneer characterized by a dumpling face, an impish smile, sneakers, bangs and owlish glasses. But Roger Starr, a former New York City housing administrator and sometime opponent of Ms. Jacobs, keenly noted the steel just beneath her folksiness.
 ''What a dear, sweet character she isn't,'' he said.
 After she was removed from the Planning Commission hearing in 1961, her own words underlined her feistiness. ''We had been ladies and gentlemen and only got pushed around,'' she said.
 But fighting with government, even being arrested with Susan Sontag and Allen Ginsberg in an antidraft protest, was something she said she had repeatedly been forced into by ''outrageous'' governmental actions.
 What she hated most about those actions was that they took time away from her writing, which she said was her way of thinking. And in at least five fields of inquiry, she thought deeply and innovatively: urban design, urban history, regional economics, the morality of the economy and the nature of economic growth.
 Each of her major books led naturally to the next. From writing about how people functioned within cities, she analyzed how cities function within nations, how nations function with one another, how everyone functions in a world of conflicting moral principles and, finally, how economies grow like biological organisms.
 A small book in 1980 arguing for Quebec separatism created a stir in Canada, while a 1996 memoir of her great-aunt's experience as a schoolteacher in rural Alaska, which she edited, impressed reviewers with its homespun wisdom.
 But it is ''Death and Life,'' published by Random House, that rocked the planning and architectural establishment.
 On one level, it represented the first liberal attack on the liberal idea of urban renewal. At the same time, the New York Times critic Brooks Atkinson saw an old-fashioned vision of community that he compared to Thornton Wilder's fictional Grover's Corners. Ms. Jacobs herself thought the book's continuing appeal was that it plumbed the depths of human nature like a good novel.
 In 2003, Herbert Muschamp, the Times's chief architecture critic, wrote that Ms. Jacobs's book was ''one of 20th-century architecture's most traumatic events,'' in part because Ms. Jacobs was dismissive about the importance of design.
 In recent years, she became an inspiration to architects and planners who espouse what they call the New Urbanism, an effort to promote social interaction by incorporating such Jacobean features as ground-floor stores in suburban developments.
 Patrick Pinnell, an architect associated with this school, said ''Death and Life'' represented almost the last expression of optimism about American cities. As early as 1974, John E. Zuccotti, then chairman of the New York City Planning Commission, called Ms. Jacobs a prophet and himself a ''neo-Jacobean'' when he announced a smaller-scale, more sensitive urban planning approach. Ms. Jacobs was born Jane Butzner on May 4, 1916, in Scranton, Pa. Her father was a physician and her mother a schoolteacher. She remembered being something of a troublemaker in school, engaging in pranks like exploding inflated paper bags in the lunchroom. She preferred reading books surreptitiously to listening to the teacher.
 In an interview in Azure magazine in 1997, Ms. Jacobs recounted her habit of carrying on imaginary conversations with Thomas Jefferson while running errands. When she could think of nothing more to tell Jefferson, she replaced him with Benjamin Franklin.
 ''Like Jefferson, he was interested in lofty things, but also in nitty-gritty, down-to-earth details,'' she said, ''such as why the alley we were walking through wasn't paved, and who would pave it if it were paved. He was interested in everything, so he was a very satisfying companion.''
 Years later, she realized that she had developed her talent of working through difficult ideas in simple terms by practicing them on her imaginary Franklin. She also acquired another inner companion through Alfred Duggan, an English historical novelist. He was Cerdic, a Saxon chieftain. Years later, she continued to chat with him while doing housework.
 ''There were only two things in the entire house that were familiar to him,'' she wrote; ''the fire (although he didn't understand the chimney) and the sword,'' a Civil War souvenir. ''Everything else had to be explained to him.''
 Not wanting to go to college, she took an unpaid position as assistant to the women's editor at The Scranton Tribune. In 1934, she moved to New York to join her sister, who was six years older and had a job in the home furnishings department of Abraham & Straus, the Brooklyn department store. The sisters lived on the top floor of a six-story walkup in Brooklyn Heights.

Subways Lead to Jobs
 Each day, Ms. Jacobs got on the subway and arbitrarily chose a stop at which to get off and look for a job. Because she liked the sound of Christopher Street, she got off there and found an apartment in Greenwich Village and soon after, a job as a secretary in a candy manufacturing company.
 She worked as a secretary for five years. The sisters did not have much money and sometimes lived on Pablum and bananas, Ms. Jacobs said in an interview with Metropolis Magazine in 2001.
 She began writing articles then, first for a metals-trade paper. She sold a series of articles about different areas of the city, like the fur district, to Vogue, earning $40 for each at a time when she was making $12 a week as a secretary. She wrote Sunday features for The New York Herald Tribune and articles for Q Magazine on manhole covers, among other things.
 While working full time, she attended Columbia University's School of General Studies for two years and took courses in geology, zoology, law, political science and economics. In 1944, Ms. Jacobs, who was then working for the Office of War Information, and her two roommates had a party in their apartment. One guest was Robert Hyde Jacobs Jr., an architect who specialized in hospital design. They met in April and married in May.
 Ms. Jacobs told Azure that she would not have written any books without her husband's encouragement. It was he who decided that the family should move to Toronto in 1968 after their sons said they would go to jail rather than serve in Vietnam. Mr. Jacobs died in 1996. Ms. Jacobs is survived by her sons, James, of Toronto, and Ned, of Vancouver; her daughter, Burgin Jacobs, of New Denver, British Columbia, and one granddaughter.

Suspicions Aroused
 In 1952, Ms. Jacobs got a job as an editor at Architectural Forum, where she stayed for 10 years. That gave her a perch from which to observe urban renewal projects. On a visit to Philadelphia, she noticed that the streets of a project were deserted while an older, nearby street was crowded.
 ''So, I got very suspicious of this whole thing,'' she told The Toronto Star in 1997. ''I pointed that out to the designer, but it was absolutely uninteresting to him. How things worked didn't interest him.
 ''He wasn't concerned about its attractiveness to people. His notion was totally aesthetic, divorced from everything else.''
 Her doubts increased after William Kirk, the director of the Union Settlement in East Harlem, taught her new ways of seeing neighborhoods. She came to see the prevalent planning notions, which involved bulldozing low-rise housing in poor neighborhoods and replacing it with tall apartment buildings surrounded by open space, as a superstition akin to early 19th-century physicians' belief in bloodletting.
 ''There is a quality even meaner than outright ugliness or disorder,'' she wrote in ''Death and Life,'' ''and this meaner quality is the dishonest mask of pretended order, achieved by ignoring or suppressing the real order that is struggling to exist and to be served.''
 William H. Whyte, the editor of Fortune magazine and the author of books about urban life as well as his celebrated ''Organization Man,'' asked Ms. Jacobs to write an article for Fortune on urban downtowns in 1958. Her essay, which was reprinted in ''The Exploding Metropolis'' (Doubleday, 1958), turned out to be a trial run for her book.
 ''Designing a dream city is easy,'' she concluded. ''Rebuilding a living one takes imagination.''
 The Fortune article caught the attention of the Rockefeller Foundation, which offered her a grant in 1958 to write about cities. Two grants and three years later, she produced her manuscript for ''Death and Life'' on the Remington typewriter that she used until her death.
 Her seemingly simple prescriptions for neighborhood diversity, short blocks, dense populations and a mix of buildings represented a major rethinking of modern planning. They were coupled with fierce condemnations of the writings of the planners Sir Patrick Geddes and Ebenezer Howard, as well as those of the architect Le Corbusier and Lewis Mumford, who championed the ideal of graceful towers rising over exquisite open spaces. Mr. Mumford held his fire for a year before replying in a New Yorker article, sardonically titled ''Home Remedies for Urban Cancer.''
 ''Like a construction gang bulldozing a site clean of all habitations, good or bad,'' Mr. Mumford wrote, ''she bulldozes out of existence every desirable innovation in urban planning during the last century, and every competing idea, without even a pretense of critical evaluation.''

Form Over Substance?
 Even the architecture critic Paul Goldberger, while expressing profound admiration for Ms. Jacobs in a New York Times article in 1996, suggested that she may have overstated the importance of the physical form of cities.
 ''Sometimes big, ugly high-rise towers work just fine,'' he wrote.
 Ms. Jacobs next book, ''The Economy of Cities'' (Random House, 1969), challenged the ideas that cities were established on a rural economic base; rather, she suggested, rural economies have been built directly through city economies. After that came ''The Question of Separatism: Quebec and the Struggle for Sovereignty'' (Random House, 1980). It argued that Canada and Quebec would be better off without each other, on the general grounds that smaller is better.
 She delved more deeply into economics and cities with ''Cities and the Wealth of Nations: Principles of Economic Life'' (Random House, 1984), in which she contended that national governments undermine the economy of cities, which she saw as the natural engines of economic growth.
 Her ''Systems of Survival: A Dialogue on the Moral Foundations of Commerce and Politics'' (Vintage, 1994) looks at the moral underpinnings of work by examining different value systems. ''The Nature of Economies'' (Modern Library, 2000) likens economic activity to an ecosystem. Her last book, ''Dark Age Ahead'' (Random House, 2004), argues that North American culture is collapsing, then suggests ways to reverse the trend.
 During her last years, Canadians held conferences to honor Ms. Jacobs. For New Yorkers, she lived on in the famous photo of her with a beer and a cigarette in the White Horse Tavern in Greenwich Village, as well as memories of her plotting municipal mischief at another Village hangout. To generations of planners, architects and students of cities, Ms. Jacobs remains a seminal influence.
 She perhaps perceived herself as an intellectual adventurer ready and able to follow her quixotic, often brilliant instincts into ever more fascinating terrain.
 In ''Systems of Survival,'' one of her characters worried that he was not qualified.
 ''Why not us?'' replied the man who had invited the group together. ''If more qualified people are up to the same thing, more power to them. But we don't know that, do we?''

HEADLINE: Director of Small Business Agency Resigns

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 25 

 BODY:
Hector V. Barreto, the embattled head of the Small Business Administration, said on Tuesday that he would resign and take over a Hispanic advocacy group that has supported some of President Bush's initiatives.
 Mr. Barreto, who had run the agency since 2001, said he had not been asked to resign but had decided that ''this was the perfect time'' to change jobs.
The White House immediately announced plans to nominate Steven C. Preston, a business executive in Chicago, to take over the agency. 
 The Small Business Administration was sharply criticized in the months after Hurricane Katrina as taking too long to handle disaster loans to homeowners and companies trying to rebuild.
 The New York Times reported in December, more than three months after the hurricane, that the agency had processed only one-third of the 276,000 applications it had received and had rejected 82 percent of those it reviewed.
 Since then, the agency says it has greatly accelerated its efforts and has now made decisions on about 90 percent of the applications and approved about $8.5 billion in loans.
 But critics of the agency contend that problems remain. The Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, told lawmakers last week that the agency had been unprepared for a major disaster and was almost ''purely in a reactive state.'' 
 The agency was also criticized last year for making disaster loans in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks that were not closely related to those events.
 Mr. Barreto's departure comes in the midst of a broader reshuffling in the Bush administration, which is struggling with low poll ratings, widespread unhappiness about rising energy prices and an economic agenda that has become stalled in Congress.
 The pace of that reshuffling accelerated this month after Joshua B. Bolten took over as Mr. Bush's chief of staff. Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's chief political strategist, gave up his formal responsibility as domestic policy adviser last week, and Scott McClellan, Mr. Bush's chief spokesman, announced plans to step down. 
 Representative Donald Manzullo, the Illinois Republican who is chairman of the House Small Business Committee, praised Mr. Barreto's efforts.
 ''Under Hector's leadership, the S.B.A. streamlined many functions and learned to do more with less while facing unparalleled challenges to the S.B.A.'s disaster loan program,'' Mr. Manzullo said Tuesday in a statement, adding that Mr. Barreto had cut costs by $100 million a year by eliminating subsidies for the agency's major loan-guarantee program.
 Democratic lawmakers were much harsher. ''He was simply not up to the challenges of running this agency,'' said Representative Nydia M. Velazquez of New York, the senior Democrat on the House small business panel. Ms. Velazquez had called for Mr. Barreto's resignation in December and said Tuesday that he had ''made the right decision'' to step down.
 Mr. Barreto, in a brief telephone interview, said he was proud of his tenure and that his resignation had nothing to do with the criticisms of his agency. 
 He said he would lead the Latino Coalition, a small advocacy group that has been largely backed by Hispanic business executives and has lent support to some of Mr. Bush's initiatives. Last year, for example, members spoke out warmly in favor of Mr. Bush's plan to overhaul Social Security and let people put some of their payroll tax contributions into individual investment accounts.
 Mr. Preston, who must be confirmed by the Senate, is a senior vice president of the ServiceMaster Company, a multibillion-dollar corporation whose businesses include TruGreen ChemLawn, a lawn care company; and Terminix, a pest control company.
 Unlike Mr. Barreto, whose family owned a restaurant in Kansas City, Mr. Preston has spent nearly all his career with large corporations.

Over the years, as the musical ''Rent'' has reached milestone after milestone -- playing around the world in more than 200 productions from Boise to Little Rock to Reykjavik -- the thousands of people who have been affected by this vibrant, gritty and compassionate work may well wonder what its creator, Jonathan Larson, would have thought of it all.
 Another milestone came on Monday night. The original Broadway production of ''Rent'' opened at the Nederlander Theater 10 years ago this Saturday. That production, directed by Michael Greif, was an almost-intact transfer of the initial production at the New York Theater Workshop, which had opened three months earlier.
To celebrate the anniversary the original cast members reassembled, rehearsed for two days and performed the show in a semistaged version at the Nederlander on Monday. The event was a benefit for the New York Theater Workshop, for Friends in Deed (a support organization that gave comfort to several of Mr. Larson's friends dealing with H.I.V. infections.), and for the Jonathan Larson Performing Arts Foundation, which was set up by his family after the enormous success of ''Rent.'' 
 Before the performance, the co-chairmen of the benefit told the star-studded audience that more than $2 million had been raised. Also addressing the crowd were Senator Charles E. Schumer and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who praised ''Rent'' as a timeless work exemplifying ''culture, community and creativity,'' in the mayor's words, and saluted the show's vast contributions to New York's theatrical life.
 Once again you could only think, ''Would Jonathan ever have imagined all this?'' Mr. Larson, who wrote the music, lyrics and books for his stage works, struggled for more than 10 years to get a producer to take a shot at one of his shows. Now he was being posthumously thanked for giving Broadway a creative and economic boost. ''Rent'' is the seventh longest running show in Broadway history.
 I count myself among those who were personally affected by Mr. Larson's work, because of the inadvertent role I played in the last hours of his life. In 1996 an editor at The Times tipped me off to the opening of a rock musical, inspired by ''La Boheme,'' which transplanted Puccini's struggling bohemians from Paris in the 1830's to the East Village in 1990's. So on Jan. 24 I went to the New York Theater Workshop to see the dress rehearsal of ''Rent,'' which was scheduled to open in February. 
 That performance was pretty ragged, with technical glitches and a misbehaving sound system. But I was swept away by the sophistication and exuberance of Mr. Larson's music and the mix of tenderness and cleverness in his lyrics. After the show Mr. Larson and I sat down for an interview in the tiny ticket booth of the theater, the only quiet space we could find amid the post-rehearsal confusion. For almost an hour, this sad-eyed and boyish creator talked about his approach to songwriting, his determination to bring the American musical tradition to the MTV generation, and about friends struggling with H.I.V. infection who had inspired the show. 
 We shook hands, he went home to his ramshackle walk-up apartment in the West Village, put a kettle on the stove to make some tea, then collapsed and died of an aortic aneurysm. He was 35.
 Understandably I have felt a little protective of ''Rent'' ever since. Four years ago, curious to see how the show was faring, I took in a performance at the Nederlander and was dismayed. The young and handsome cast was full of talent. But the sound system was blaringly loud. The show was pumped up with a rockish brashness that seemed forced, as if the presenters, afraid that the subtlety of Mr. Larson's score would be lost on young audiences, had opted to bludgeon them into submission. 
 On that last night of his life Mr. Larson spoke of his desire to bridge the world of musical theater, which has championed the artful mingling of words and music, with the world of rock, which feeds on pulsating rhythms and visceral power. He wanted his score to have rockish energy. But lyrics were everything to him, and he wanted the words to be audible, not buried in buzz-saw speaker noise. ''The bane of my existence is that I'm relying on electronics, and I'm only as good as my sound board operator,'' he told me that night.
 My guess is that Mr. Larson would have been pleased by the film version of ''Rent'' directed by Chris Columbus, released last year. I went to the film with trepidation. To me ''Rent'' is a triumph of theater. But adapting a musical for film inevitably involves opening it up, as this movie did with street scenes filmed on location in New York. Onstage the death of Angel, the endearing drag queen, is depicted abstractly with billowing sheets and a circle of bereft friends. In the film the scene is made literal, set in an intensive care unit. The filmed ''Rent'' seems a safer show than Mr. Larson may have intended. Still, every word in every lyric is audible, every voice in the complex choral numbers comes through, and the richness of Mr. Larson's harmonies works its magic.
 The producers were worried at first that the original cast -- many are in the film -- would look too mature. But just as in Puccini's opera, there is no reason the circle of friends in ''Rent'' cannot be in their early 30's rather than their early 20's. They looked terrific in the film.
 The original cast members looked more than terrific when they walked onstage on Monday night to the screeching ovation of the audience and lined up in a row to sing the show's disarming anthem ''Seasons of Love.''
 Though this performance was not intended for review, I can say that that the cast did itself proud. Understandably, as actors fumbled for lines now and then, the event became as much an affectionate reunion as a straight-ahead performance. But moment after moment brought you back to the early days of ''Rent'' when the show's honesty and power were so stunning. Adam Pascal, the original Roger, the punk band singer and songwriter at the heart of the show, has lost none of his sexiness and charisma. His voice, at once raw and plaintive, especially when he lets a note swell with earthy vibrato, soared in ''Glory,'' the ballad that seems like Mr. Larson's premonition of his own death: ''One song/ Glory/One Song/Before I go/Glory/ One song to leave behind.'' 
 The crowd broke into frenzy when Daphne Rubin-Vega, as Mimi, the S&M club dancer who falls for Roger, straddled the railing of the stage's upper level to sing the gritty ''Out Tonight.'' Idina Menzel as Maureen and Taye Diggs as Bennie (who are now married and have both gone on to thriving careers) could not resist bantering during scenes that brought them together. The audience loved it. Anthony Rapp was again the ideal Mark, the loose-limbed and insecure video artist who believes so strongly in his community of friends. Though Jesse L. Martin is by far best known these days for his role as Detective Edward Green on ''Law & Order,'' he looked elated to be singing and playing the good-hearted Tom Collins, who falls in love with Angel. And the slight-framed yet dynamic Wilson Jermaine Heredia, who won a Tony Award for his portrayal of Angel, again disarmed the audience with his cross-dressing dance number ''Today 4 U.'' 
 At the end of the evening the original cast retreated to the rear of the stage and the current cast appeared to sing ''Seasons of Love.'' They looked like fresh-faced kids playing grown-up roles. Then the stage filled with dozens of actors, all former members of ''Rent'' casts who joined in the song, until, at the end, everybody hugged everybody. Afterward there was a reception at Cipriani on East 42nd Street, where the original cast members were swamped by autograph-seekers and you could see celebrities like Jon Bon Jovi chatting with the mayor.
 For me the original production at the 150-seat New York Theater Workshop will never be topped. The intimacy of the space allowed the performance to have subtlety and clarity, while still packing a rocking wallop. But ''Rent'' has become something bigger than Jonathan Larson ever imagined.

 BODY:
WHEN a well-known professor of nutrition writes a book titled ''What to Eat,'' it is fair to wonder what she likes for lunch. 
 Recently, the professor, Marion Nestle, a confessed foodie, chose roasted beets, assorted squashes with hazelnut vinaigrette, roasted brussels sprouts with chevre and caramelized walnuts.
''Whenever I hear people say they don't like vegetables, I think they need to taste ones that have been cooked well,'' she said at one of her favorite restaurants, Savoy, which features Greenmarket produce.
 Her meal mirrored the philosophy outlined in her book: eat locally and, if possible, organically; keep it simple; concentrate on vegetables and fruits and make meat a condiment; and forget about processed foods. 
 And if there is an outstanding dessert, do not pass it up. On this day it was whiskey-soaked warm apple cake with black cardamom ice cream. ''I don't worry about having creme brulee once in a while,'' said Dr. Nestle, whose professional title is Paulette Goddard Professor of Nutrition, Food Studies and Public Health at New York University.
 Her love affair with food goes back to her days at a camp in Vermont where Chinese food was served. 
 ''It had a garden, and if you were a good camper, you could pick vegetables for dinner,'' she said, savoring the memory. ''What I remember is that they were warm. One for me, one for the pot. This is what a string bean is supposed to taste like. I was about 8, and it will stay with me the rest of my life. I can hold tastes in my memory.''
 That is why Dr. Nestle, who is on leave for a semester and teaching at the University of California, Berkeley, can simultaneously be on the advisory board of the Chez Panisse Foundation and a consultant to the World Health Organization. She is also the bane of the food industry, which she has blamed for the country's obesity problem, and she is a favorite of reporters because she knows what she wants to say and her thoughts come out in complete sentences, often with a lifted eyebrow. (Years ago she wrote a blurb for one of my books.)
 Her laserlike view of the food world is evident throughout ''What to Eat,'' to be published next week by North Point Press: ''The best evidence that organic standards really do mean something and are not so easy to achieve comes from the U.S.D.A.'s unrelenting efforts to weaken them,'' she writes.
 It was not until she put her observations and opinions in book form that the public and the food industry began to understand the power of her plain-speaking ways. In ''Food Politics'' (University of California Press, 2002) she blamed the food industry for many of the country's nutritional problems, not the least of them obesity. In her 2003 book, ''Safe Food: Bacteria, Biotechnology and Bioterrorism'' (University of California Press), she said government oversight of food safety provided far more protection to the food industry than to the public.
 The books do not fall into the category of popular nutrition. But they and everything else she has done in her career were preludes to ''What to Eat.''
 The new book is for anyone who has read a food label; been annoyed at how often their children nag them for certain cereals; wondered about the difference between natural and organic; or questioned who is minding the store when it comes to nutrition and food safety.
 Dr. Nestle said ''What to Eat'' was written in response to popular demand. 
 ''I had friends, reasonably active and healthy, who said they didn't have a clue to what to eat,'' she said. ''They would say things to me like, supermarkets bring me to tears.''
 Writing it was easier than writing a book about nutrition, she said. ''That's painful, because you can't do it without talking about science, and it's hard to make science understandable to people who haven't studied it,'' she said. ''So instead I went into a Wegmans and began at the produce section. After an hour I knew I had a book.''
 Dr. Nestle has no illusions about her 600-plus-page tome. 
 ''It's not the great Western novel,'' she said. ''It's not 'War and Peace.' People should just dip into it and read the things they are interested in. Then they can get more information from the footnotes.''
 Her voice is clear as she takes the reader by the hand up and down every supermarket aisle: ''No matter what their labels say, margarines are basically the same -- mixtures of soybean oil and food additives. Everything else is theater and greasepaint.''
 Those looking for a lot of prescriptive advice -- do this, don't do that -- will not find it. Dr. Nestle lays out the facts as she sees them; readers are invited to make their own choices. But she does provide her mantra for the basic principles of a good diet: eat less, move more, eat lots of fruits and vegetables, and go easy on junk foods.
 She also advises parents who want their children to eat healthfully to stick to the periphery of the store. That's where the fresh, unprocessed foods are. ''Don't set foot in the center aisles,'' she cautions. The chapters are divided by aisles: produce section, dairy section and so on. Safety and nutrition are addressed in detail.
 Along the way Dr. Nestle confesses she is perplexed by some things others in the nutrition community believe fervently. For example, she finds the glycemic index for potatoes ''absurdly complicated,'' reminding everyone that total calorie consumption is more important than any index. (The glycemic index ranks foods containing carbohydrates by how quickly glucose is absorbed from them.)
 She occasionally provides more scientific information than most people want to know, as in a detailed discussion of how calories are calculated. 
 Dr. Nestle, who was born in Brooklyn, set out to earn a degree in dietetics but lasted one day, switching to science. With a doctorate in molecular biology from Berkeley, she wanted a career as a researcher, but found it impossible with two small children. Instead she taught at Brandeis and was lured to the University of California, San Francisco, to teach nutrition to medical students. Then a new dean arrived and told her she could not continue teaching nutrition to medical students without an M.D. degree. She returned to Berkeley to get a master's degree in public health nutrition.
 Her next stop was Washington, where she was managing editor of the 1988 Surgeon General's Report on Diet and Health. That same year she went to New York University as chairman of the home economics and nutrition department, with a mandate to bring it into the 20th century. By 1996 it had become the nutrition and food studies program, offering, for the first time, a doctorate in food studies. Three years ago she stepped down to pursue her own research and spend more time writing.
 In keeping with her direct manner, Dr. Nestle does not tiptoe around any issue, no matter how difficult or personal. Asked her age, she said, ''Sixty-nine, but you don't have to put that in the paper, do you?''
 She was told that she looked considerably younger. Without missing a beat, but with a small, triumphant smile, she was ready: ''Good nutrition,'' she said. 
 Pause.
 ''I couldn't resist.''

HEADLINE: Fostering Young Artists: Start Spreading the News

BYLINE: By ERIKA KINETZ

 BODY:
Success in Miami is one thing, success in New York quite another. For 25 quietly auspicious years, the National Foundation for Advancement in the Arts, a nonprofit organization in Miami that encourages young artists, has been much better at starting others to fame than securing its own. On Monday night the group took a major step in orchestrating its own advance in New York City with a respectably star-studded gala performance at the Baryshnikov Arts Center. 
 ''Strategically we recognized New York as an extremely important stepping stone for an organization like ours based in Miami to create more of a national presence,'' said William Banchs, the group's president. 
The foundation awards high school seniors more than $500,000 in cash prizes each year for achievement in the performing, literary and visual arts. It also nominates presidential scholars in the arts, and some colleges refer to its rosters for recruitment.
 Yet many people have never heard of the foundation. 
 ''This is our coming-out party,'' said Lin Arison, the widow of Ted Arison, who started the foundation in 1981 with $5 million of the fortune he amassed as founder of Carnival Cruise Lines. ''Keep your fingers crossed. This has got to work.'' 
 Ms. Arison said she donated about $20,000 this year to hire two public relations agencies and underwrote Monday night's awards ceremony. Next year the event is to be at the Museum of Modern Art. 
 Monday night's show featured a velvet rope, a wall of popping flashbulbs, performances by some wildly talented teenagers, and awards presented by Sam Shepard, John Guare, Debra Winger, Arthur Penn, Christo and Jeanne-Claude, and Deborah Voigt. Earlier awards shows were low key. 
 ''We realized it's not fair to these young people,'' Ms. Arison said. ''When they win the N.F.A.A. award, it has to be like a Pulitzer Prize or a Nobel Prize or a Heisman Trophy.''
 She still has a way to go. Many students don't know about the foundation or its awards until a teacher encourages them to apply. Then they have to explain everything to their family and friends outside the art world.
 ''A lot of my peers are athletes,'' Garrett Coleman, a winner in dance from Central Catholic High School in Pittsburgh, said on a lunch break at the Baryshnikov Arts Center on Monday afternoon. ''They have no idea what is going on.''
 ''That's what I was surprised about,'' said Grace Weber, a winner in voice who attends Pius XI High School in Milwaukee. ''People outside the art world don't know about it.''
 Billy Buss, a winner in jazz trumpet and a senior at Berkeley High School in California, added, ''My friends only cared I was winning a lot of money.''
 Past winners, who include the novelist Allegra Goodman, the actress Vanessa Williams, the dancer and choreographer Desmond Richardson, the actor Ron Eldard, at least 15 dancers from the New York City Ballet and 8 members of the New York Philharmonic, are far better known than the program itself. 
 ''It's a real mouthful, but it's a wonderful organization,'' said Ms. Goodman, a 1985 recipient who just published her fifth book, ''Intuition.'' ''I think it made me realize this could be a career for me, that I could be in the community of artists.'' She said she was also convinced it helped her get into Harvard. 
 This year 160 of the more than 6,500 applicants were chosen to spend a week in Miami, all expenses paid, working together and taking master classes with Mikhail Baryshnikov, Michael Tilson Thomas and Placido Domingo, among others. From this group 38 winners were chosen to perform in New York; top prizes are $10,000 and $5,000. 
 The program draws from a diverse student population. The foundation sends out information to 26,000 high schools across the country. Applications come from every state, more than 90 percent of them from public schools, Mr. Banchs said. About a third of the applicants and about 40 percent of winners identify themselves as members of minorities, he added.
 Ted Arison started the foundation in part because he was a frustrated pianist. ''He wasn't encouraged by his father, who was a businessman,'' explained Ms. Arison, who said she herself was a frustrated writer in her youth. One of the program's goals is to provide high-level encouragement. 
 Rachel Moore, the executive director of American Ballet Theater, won a foundation award in 1982 and became a presidential scholar. Her parents are both economists. ''After I won, I got a ton of scholarships from universities I'd never applied to,'' she said. ''They sent them carte blanche. It provided my parents some comfort. It was recognition in their world.''
 In addition, spending a week with like-minded peers is not something a young gospel singer from Milwaukee, like Ms. Weber, or an Irish step dancer from Pittsburgh, like Mr. Coleman, takes for granted. 
 ''It was like an ugly duckling finding her swan family,'' said Patti Weber, Grace's mother. ''She's not like anyone in this family. She's just in a different world.''
 Kevin Grant, whose daughter Shalita won in theater, stood in the lobby of the arts center on Monday night, having successfully negotiated the velvet rope. ''I didn't really understand it at first, until she started explaining it to me,'' said Mr. Grant, who sells clothes at flea markets, dances and writes plays in Baltimore. ''Then I said: 'What, it's that big? Wow!' ''
 For Shalita, the victory was personal. ''It changed my relationship with myself,'' she said. ''I must have something going here.'' She's headed to Juilliard next year. ''This is an awesome network,'' she added. ''This place is like a safety net.''

HEADLINE: Realtor Study Says Market May Be Cooling, but Slowly 

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
The housing market is not slowing as fast as economists expected, according to a report yesterday, but some say the data suggest a more pronounced contraction in the next few months. 
 In a report that carried mixed signals, the National Association of Realtors said sales of existing homes edged up last month, the number of homes for sale rose markedly and prices increased more slowly.
Sales of existing homes, which make up about 85 percent of all homes sold, increased 0.3 percent in March, to an annual pace of 6.92 million. That was higher than the 6.9 million pace in February and the 6.57 million pace in January but lower than the 6.97 million pace in March 2005. Sales were up in the Northeast and Midwest but dropped slightly in the West and South.
 Economists expected sales to fall to a pace of 6.66 million, according to a survey by Bloomberg News.
 The national median selling price -- half the homes sold for more and half for less -- was $218,000, up 7.4 percent from a year earlier. The increase was smaller than the 9.5 percent gain in February and the 11.7 percent increase in January. 
 The number of homes on the market rose 7 percent, to 3.2 million. At the current sales pace, that amounts to a 5.8-month supply, up from 5.5 months in February and four months in March 2005. Economists say the rising number of homes on the market makes it harder for sellers to demand higher prices, as buyers take advantage of greater choice and their increased bargaining power.
 ''The bidding fever that was present a year or so ago has all but disappeared, and that's another sign that this market is slowing,'' said Anthony Chan, chief economist at J. P. Morgan's private client services group.
 Starting late last year, buyers and sellers of homes, particularly in the East and West Coast markets, appeared to be staring each other down. Many buyers, sensing a slowdown coming, said they were holding out for a better deal, while sellers, believing they still controlled the market, refused to cut their prices.
 The increase in sales in February and March indicate that the standoff is easing as sellers cut asking prices to lure buyers, economists said.
 Real estate speculators in particular were affected, said David Lereah, chief economist for the Realtors. In many Florida and California cities, he said, investors who bought condominiums and other property in a bid to make a quick profit are scrambling to unload them as interest rates rise. The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage was 6.32 percent in March, up from 6.25 percent in February. ''They are all leaving at once, particularly in Miami and Naples and some of the California markets,'' he said. 
 Mr. Lereah said the small sales increases in the last two months were temporary. ''Interest rates have gone up and we will see sales come down a little more,'' he said.
 Separately, the Conference Board said that consumer confidence rose to its highest level since May 2002 as Americans felt more optimistic about the job market. The index registered 109.6 this month, up from 107.5 in March.

HEADLINE: The Neighborhood That the Ballpark Built

BYLINE: By MORRIS NEWMAN

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO 

 BODY:
A building that once held a Depression-era produce market is sprouting two new stories of office space, one of the many renovation and construction projects in the area immediately surrounding three-year-old Petco Park, home of the San Diego Padres baseball team. 
 An amalgam of an old red-brick building and new metal-and-glass construction, the TR Produce building -- a development of a local firm, Cruzan Monroe -- seems a fitting symbol of a rapidly developing urban area known as the Ballpark District, which combines new uses for older buildings with new construction.
The district is a 26-block area carved out of the East Village, a former harbor and manufacturing area. 
 San Diego is one of a number of cities, including Baltimore and Denver, that have used the construction of new baseball parks to spark the redevelopment of downtown areas. But it is probably the only one in which the stadium developer is also the prime mover in the redevelopment of the entire district surrounding the ballpark, said John C. Kratzer, president and chief executive of JMI Realty of San Diego, the company that is handling both of those tasks. The owner of the Padres, John Moores, is the chairman of JMI Realty. 
 This dual role is a result of a complex deal approved by San Diego voters in 1998 after considerable public debate and multiple lawsuits. Under the terms of the agreement, the city contributed $169 million in bond proceeds toward the construction of the $411 million Petco Park.
 In exchange, JMI Realty is committed to pay off a portion of the bonds through higher property taxes generated by new construction in the district and through hotel tax revenues. The projects include those of JMI Realty as well as those of others in the district. 
 To enable JMI to generate new tax revenues, the city gave Mr. Moores and JMI the right to create a master plan for the 26 blocks surrounding the ballpark. JMI itself acquired about 10 of the blocks, while the city acquired other portions. 
 Although JMI is now in an enviable position as a land owner and developer, the picture looked different in the late 1990's, when the company took on the task of developing a transitional area, then known best for artists' lofts, Mr. Kratzer said. 
 Although the original plan was to form partnerships with investors and other developers, the initial response was negative. ''None of those folks were very interested in playing in this market,'' he recalled. 
 In the following five years, JMI built two hotels in the ballpark area, while selling off some properties, including the TR Produce building, to other developers, who began to stream in as construction of the ballpark proceeded. 
 Mr. Kratzer said he was surprised by the strength of the interest that developers had in the East Village once momentum shifted.
 ''If we had told the city in 1998 that our development activity would become the catalyst for another $100 million in development, they would have said that was unbelievable beyond all expectation,'' he said.
 The actual results have eclipsed that amount. So far, the ballpark area has attracted $1.4 billion of new investment, according to Mr. Kratzer.
 Formerly an area of light industrial buildings and warehouses, the Ballpark District was among the last neighborhoods to benefit from a wave of condo and loft development in the downtown area. Nearly 4,000 new rentals and condominiums are now under construction, and another 7,500 are planned, according to the Centre City Development Corporation, a nonprofit corporation created by the city for downtown redevelopment. 
 Even though there are fewer than a dozen industrial buildings surviving in the East Village, JMI made an effort to integrate historic architecture into the ballpark. Borrowing a page from Camden Yards in Baltimore, where the facade of an old warehouse is visible from the grandstands, the developer of Petco Park used a wall of the Western Metal Supply Company building as part of the left field wall. 
 Completed in 1934, the TR Produce building is one of about a dozen surviving structures from around 1870 to the early 1930's in the East Village. The old produce building and the new commercial condominium complex within its walls are a novel combination of historic preservation and new construction.
 Under an agreement struck with a local preservationist group, the old and new buildings barely touch each other. The new structure was built within the walls of the produce building. Standing on a stiltlike structure of steel columns, the new metal-and-glass commercial condominium complex rises above the old brick walls to peer into the ballpark. 
 Built in a nontraditional style the developer calls ''industrial chic,'' the new building, which cost about $20 million, complies with another preservationist requirement to keep the two structures visually distinct, said Bruce D. Coons, the executive director of the Save Our Heritage Organization, a nonprofit group. The preservationist group negotiated the standards of reuse for 11 historic buildings in the ballpark area with the developer and city officials.
 Another purpose of the unusual separation of the two structures is to make it possible, if a future owner wishes, to dismantle the office structure while leaving the historic portion intact. 
 ''It is a fairly unique solution, at least for San Diego,'' Mr. Coons said of the hybrid structure. 
 While condominium ownership of office space is a rarity in San Diego (only one other downtown building offers similar units), the developer and at least one buyer say the expected growth of office rents in downtown San Diego justifies the cost of the condos. 
 The units range in price from $300,000 to about $1 million, and vary in size from 700 to 1,300 square feet. Twenty-two out of 28 loft-style office condominiums in the expansion to the old produce building have received commitments from buyers, said Dennis Cruzan, a principal and co-founder of Cruzan Monroe, who added that he hoped to sell the ground floor, which is part of the old brick structure, to a restaurant or deli. 
 Typical buyers of the office condos, according to the developer, are ''stable businesspeople who have been in business for many years, such as lawyers, sales reps, furniture people, accountants, sports agents and the like.''
 Among these buyers is Thomas P. Burke, proprietor of Omni Pacific, a maker of contract office furniture, who has committed to buy two units. One is to serve as a furniture showroom, and the second as an investment property.
 Mr. Burke operated his furniture business in the area until rising rents, in some places as high as $48 per square foot annually, forced him to look for new space. By owning a 1,300-square-foot showroom, Mr. Burke says he can save money now -- his mortgage payments are about $30 per square foot annually -- while avoiding rent increases.
 Although downtown San Diego has had very little new office construction for a decade or more, its office vacancy rate remains quite low. It is now 9 percent, said Bill Shrader, senior vice president of Burnham Real Estate, a local real estate brokerage firm.
 ''We did not overbuild office space, especially in the downtown area, so the investment market thinks this is a great place,'' he said.
 Mr. Burke, meanwhile, said the ballpark itself was part of his marketing plan. 
 On game days, he plans to use the showroom, which has a partial view of the playing field, as a ''hospitality suite.'' Potential buyers can watch the game on large-screen plasma televisions, within earshot of the stadium crowd, only a few hundred yards away.

HEADLINE: In Tapes of Subway Plot Suspect, A Disjointed Torrent of Hatred

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM

 BODY:
The two men speak over the steady rhythmic pulse of the tan Toyota's tires passing over seams in the pavement along the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. The younger man, a Pakistani immigrant sitting in the passenger seat, does most of the talking during the conversations on a series of summer nights in 2004.
 He is unaware, as he sometimes angrily sputters in disjointed, heavily accented English about his hatred for America, that his driver, Osama Eldawoody, a naturalized American citizen, is a police informer, secretly recording their discussions. 
On one hot and humid July night, the younger man, Shahawar Matin Siraj, who was then 22, seems to gloat as the two men drive from Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, to Jackson Heights, Queens: ''See two twin towers are already gone, you cannot see no more.'' He laughs. ''They killed a lot of our brothers, now they want us to fight,'' he says, adding, ''These are bad people.''
 Speaking to his driver, he derides a passing policeman: ''Hello, pig. Hi, pig. Bye, pig. Pig, you have a problem?'' Then, ''You, pig, will learn the lesson someday.'' And also sings -- apparently mimicking a song. ''Brooklyn Bridge is falling down. Falling down. Falling down. The black guys used to sing this song, remember?''
 The conversation was one of roughly a dozen played yesterday in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, where Mr. Siraj is on trial, charged with conspiring to blow up the subway station beneath Herald Square in Manhattan. They ranged from the sinister to the more fantastical.
 Among the topics: a discussion on the possibility of attacking the United States Army with nuclear weapons; killing Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft, in order to damage the American economy; stealing nuclear material from reactors or, apparently, from the once top-secret base in Nevada known to U.F.O. buffs as Area 51 (although Mr. Siraj referred to it as Area 52).
 The government has introduced portions of more than 30 hours of taped conversations in an effort to portray Mr. Siraj as a dangerous man intent on wreaking havoc. Mr. Siraj, who came from Karachi in 1999 to join his parents in Queens, met the informer at an Islamic bookstore, where Mr. Siraj worked, next to a mosque. The New York Police Department's Intelligence Division had dispatched Mr. Eldawoody, who was born in Egypt, to the mosque and the bookstore to determine whether potentially violent radicals frequented either place.
 Mr. Siraj's lawyers have argued that when a fuller picture is presented -- and a more extensive release of the tapes is made -- it will be clear that the plot was orchestrated by the informer. The lawyers have argued that the informer was interested in the nearly $100,000 he earned from the police over the nearly three years he worked on the case, and that Mr. Siraj was little more than a foolish dupe.
 James Elshafay, who was arrested along with Mr. Siraj on Aug. 27, 2004, has pleaded guilty in the case, and is expected to testify against his onetime friend, Mr. Siraj.
 Yesterday, over the course of several hours, an assistant United States attorney, Todd Harrison, alternately played the tapes and then questioned a fidgeting Mr. Eldawoody about the conversations. The jurors in the case listened to the recordings through wireless headsets and followed them with transcripts prepared by the government. The witness, Mr. Siraj, the judge, lawyers, the court clerks, the defendant's family, spectators and news reporters also listened through headsets.
 An expressionless Mr. Siraj, pallid and clad in a loose-fitting dark suit with a white open-collared shirt, sat between two of his three lawyers at the defense table. He spent much of the day hunched over, his face just inches from a pad. He sometimes leaned back and looked into the gallery, where his parents were sitting.
 On occasions, he seemed to shake his head while Mr. Eldawoody spoke.
 One night in July, a recording captured the two men talking about a plan to blow up the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge and three other bridges linking Staten Island with New Jersey, which prosecutors said Mr. Siraj ultimately abandoned for the Herald Square subway plot.
 Mr. Siraj talked about the economic damage that would be caused by stranding Staten Island without the bridges, and seemed pleased that he had recruited Mr. Elshafay, who he indicated was the actual author of the alleged plan.
 During another conversation, this one in June, Mr. Siraj sounded upset when he talked about a picture he said he had seen that purported to show an American soldier setting a dog upon a handcuffed 13-year-old Iraqi girl and the dog raping the child. Mr. Siraj recounts a conversation he said he had with an American woman who said such attacks were commonplace against American women in jail cells.
 ''That was enough for me,'' he said. ''I'm ready to do anything. I don't care about my life.''
 Mr. Siraj's lawyers have argued that he was incited to all his talk about violent acts -- no material for any attack was ever sought or obtained by Mr. Siraj -- by the informer. They have said he regularly spoke to Mr. Siraj of alleged injustices perpetrated by the American authorities against Muslims.
 The tapes also capture conversations about nuclear weapons -- Mr. Eldawoody has a bachelor's degree in nuclear engineering -- and about obtaining nuclear materials from the Russian mafia.
 Mr. Siraj wondered if they could create a bomb and use it against the United States Army.
 ''But can we do it over here, something like that, a big explosion that can take over the, like, army, army of America, that can kill the army of America?'' he asked, saying he hoped to ''take out the majority of them with one punch.''
 Mr. Eldawoody responded by talking about the problems involved, and without explanation, referred to the burning point of uranium 235.

HEADLINE: City Plans 2,000-Bed Jail on Landfill Site in the South Bronx 

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
New York City plans to build a 2,000-bed jail on an abandoned garbage dump on the East River in the South Bronx, a site that was rejected by city officials in 1991 amid allegations that its previous owner had ties to organized crime.
 The city's Economic Development Corporation is negotiating with the current owner, Oak Point Energy, to acquire the 28-acre tract near the Oak Point railyard. The project would cost $375 million, and ground could be broken as early as 2008, said John Antonelli, senior deputy commissioner for the Department of Correction. 
The jail would be the first freestanding one built in the city since 1991, correction officials said. A floating jail barge, which holds 800 beds, was anchored at nearby Hunts Point in 1992. The new jail will be used to house men and women arrested in the Bronx and awaiting trial.
 City correction officials are moving to replace some of the aging buildings at the Rikers Island complex that have been ordered closed by a federal court because of poor conditions. The city also plans to spend $240 million to expand a jail in Brooklyn and add retail businesses at that site. 
 At a hearing yesterday, Mr. Antonelli said the money for the Bronx and the Brooklyn projects would come from the department's capital budget. ''Our analysis of the capital and operating costs,'' he said, ''shows that building in the boroughs will be more efficient than building and operating new capacity on Rikers Island.'' 
 The land in the Bronx is one of the largest privately owned pieces of undeveloped commercial real estate in the city. In 1988 it was bought by Britestarr Homes Inc., which proposed creating a modular-housing factory that could revitalize the area. Instead, the site was used as a garbage dump and, in 1991, Britestarr was investigated for possible ties to John A. Gotti, son of the reputed Gambino crime family boss. 
 By May 2002 the company had filed for bankruptcy, leaving the property with more than $60 million in claims against it, including $17 million owed to the state for environmental cleanup costs and fines, and $10 million more in back taxes claimed by the city. Oak Point Energy bought the land later that year. 
 Several Bronx community groups and environmentalists said yesterday that they opposed the city's plan for a new jail, saying they preferred the land be used for a recycling plant or retail and business development. Oak Point Energy had also proposed building a power plant at the site, but did not follow through.
 Elena Conte, a staff member for Sustainable South Bronx, said the community was keenly interested in the development of the site and urged the city to include them in the process. ''Deals are being made,'' she said, ''but there's very little transparency and no real opportunity for public participation, and that's a major concern.'' 
 Norris McDonald, president of the African American Environmentalist Association, a national group that has an office in the Bronx, said that jails and power plants were not the solution. ''I mean, who wants a prison in their neighborhood?'' he said. ''It isn't smart growth, or sustainable development, and frankly, there are dangerous individuals housed there.''
 But Mr. Antonelli said a new jail would generate economic revenue for the borough. He said the Oak Point site was reconsidered after the current owner approached the city about selling it. The economic development agency would not provide details about the negotiations. 
 Mr. Antonelli said that the Correction Department had agreed earlier to give up another jail site for redevelopment as part of the Bronx Terminal Market, and in exchange the department was promised a replacement site. 
 At the hearing, Councilman James Vacca, who represents the northeast Bronx, urged Mr. Antonelli to listen to the concerns of Bronx residents. ''I would anticipate opposition to this,'' Mr. Vacca said. ''But I think that your agency is going to have to come forth with a more detailed plan than what we have today.''

HEADLINE: Strong Economic Data Help Drive Share Prices Lower 

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday as unexpected increases in consumer confidence and home sales heightened concern that the Federal Reserve would keep raising interest rates.
 The share prices of energy companies slid after President Bush said he would stop deliveries for the summer to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and promote alternative fuels. Valero Energy paced the retreat as crude oil prices fell for a second day.
 The Dow Jones industrial average lost 53.07 points, or 0.47 percent, closing at 11,283.25. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 6.37 points, or 0.49 percent, to 1,301.74. The Nasdaq composite index fell 3.08 points, or 0.13 percent, to 2,330.30. And the Russell 2000 index of smaller-capitalization stocks lost 1.32 points, or 0.17 percent, to 764.82. 
 Five stocks declined for every three that rose on the New York Stock Exchange. Some 1.68 billion shares changed hands on the Big Board, nearly 3 percent above the three-month average.
 Shares fell after the Conference Board reported that its consumer confidence index rose to 109.6 this month from 107.5 in March, higher than forecasts of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.
 In addition, the sales of previously owned homes climbed last month to a higher-than-expected annual pace of 6.92 million, according to the National Association of Realtors. 
 Oil for June delivery declined 45 cents yesterday, to $72.88 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange, extending Monday's $1.84 drop. A gauge of S.& P. 500 energy stocks slumped 1.1 percent.
 Copper rose above $7,000 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange, leading a rally in metals, as threats to supplies prompted investors to increase purchases of commodities.
 On the bond market, amid expectations that the Fed would continue raising rates, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note increased to 5.07 percent, the highest since June 2002, from 4.98 percent on Monday. The price, which moves in the opposite direction from the yield, fell 22/32, to 95 20/32. 
 John Davidson, president of PartnerRe Asset Management, said, ''People were expecting lower consumer confidence, lower house sales and less pressure on the Fed to raise rates.'' The rise in bond yields, he added, ''has frightened the equity market.''
 A gauge of utilities lost 1.3 percent for the worst performance among 10 industry groups in the S.& P. 500. Higher bond yields make the utility group's dividend payouts less attractive. 
 Valero Energy, the largest United States oil refiner, lost $2.80, to $66.30, even after reporting a 59 percent surge in first-quarter profit. Exxon Mobil, the biggest publicly traded oil company, declined 46 cents, to $63.95.
 Duke Energy, the nation's largest utility owner, retreated 70 cents, to $28.60. Edison International, a big California utility-holding company, fell 30 cents, to $40.50. PPL, a Pennsylvania utility owner, slid 55 cents, to $28.83.
 The railroad company Burlington Northern Santa Fe dropped $5.35, or more than 6 percent, to $81.49. It said its full-year profit would be $4.81 a share, less than analysts had expected. 
 The luxury-goods seller Coach dropped $2.34, or 6.6 percent, to $32.86, the largest drop in the S.&. P 500. The company said its fiscal third-quarter profit rose 35 percent, to $108.8 million, or 28 cents a share, the smallest gain in a year. Revenue increased 20 percent, to $497.9 million, the smallest rise in four years.
 Yum Brands, the owner of restaurant chains including Taco Bell, advanced $1.74, to $51.34. It lifted its 2006 profit forecast as first-quarter results exceeded analysts' estimates.
 Following are the results of yesterday's auctions of four-week Treasury bills and five-year inflation-protected notes:

HEADLINE: 80,000 Native Canadians to Be Compensated for School Abuse

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: TORONTO, April 26 

 BODY:
In a long delayed conclusion to a dark chapter of Canadian history, negotiators have reached an agreement to compensate 80,000 Native Canadians who attended a government-financed school system where many suffered physical and sexual abuse.
 The widespread incidence of alcoholism, family violence and incest in many Native Canadian communities has long been linked to the experiences of generations who attended the so-called residential schools, which were dedicated to forced assimilation and operated for more than a century, until the 1980's.
Typically, government agents forced Inuit, Cree and other children to leave their parents and attend the schools, where they were harshly punished for speaking their own languages or practicing their religions. 
 Negotiators representing the government, native peoples and several churches that administered the schools agreed that nearly $2 billion would be paid out in damages. Payments are set to begin next year, but will possibly be accelerated for the elderly and the sick.
 The accord, which negotiators called one of the largest damage settlements in Canada's history, needs cabinet and court approval, but that is considered a formality.
 Jim Prentice, the Indian affairs and northern development minister, announced the agreement without fanfare on the floor of the House of Commons on Tuesday afternoon. There was no official apology, although the federal government had already admitted that sexual and physical abuse in the schools was widespread.
 The residential schools have long been a source of embarrassment to Canadians, and the announcement of the agreement received little news media attention.
 But Native Canadian leaders reacted with excitement over the culmination of years of painful negotiations and government efforts to fight the litigation that cost $80 million.
 ''We're extremely pleased,'' said Phil Fontaine, national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, an Ojibwe speaker and one of the negotiators. He attended two Manitoba residential schools where he says he suffered sexual and physical abuse. ''It's about symbolic recognition of the loss of languages and cultures.'' 
 He added that he was still hopeful that Prime Minister Stephen Harper would apologize for the schools. A former minister of Indian affairs did apologize in 1998 but Native Canadian leaders have long sought an apology from a prime minister.
 The agreement allots payments of about $20,000 to the 80,000 former students. It will also provide about $120 million for a foundation that will promote traditional native healing therapies, as well as a ''truth and reconciliation'' commission that will hear testimony from victims. Perpetrators also may come forward if they want to confess, but Kathleen Mahoney, one of the negotiators, said they would not be granted amnesty. 
 The Presbyterian, Anglican, United and Roman Catholic Churches have agreed to open their archives so that documents relating to the schools they ran can be included in a national archive devoted to the residential school experience.
 About 1,500 residential school victims have received court compensation over the last 12 years, about one in 10 who filed claims. The government has also distributed hundreds of small out-of-court settlements.
 In recent years the federal government tried to make amends by forming the Aboriginal Healing Foundation, an agency that studied the legacy of the residential schools.
 There has been a cultural renaissance of sorts in many of the communities, with public schools teaching languages and dance to revive pride and identity. Nevertheless, joblessness and poverty are forcing many young Native Canadians to move to the cities, where there are more economic opportunities.

HEADLINE: U.S. Options on Darfur Are Running Out 

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 26 

 BODY:
As the violence in the Darfur region of Sudan grows ever more deadly, Bush administration officials now acknowledge that they have few if any promising policy options for containing the carnage.
 If there is no agreement by Sunday on a way to resolve the crisis, the long-running peace talks are to be disbanded. But hopes for an agreement are low.
One proposal, to send 20,000 United Nations peacekeepers to Sudan, has been stymied by Khartoum's adamant opposition. Without the government's agreement, the Bush administration acknowledges, dispatching troops to Darfur would rightly be viewed as an invasion. 
 ''Sudan policy has run off the road into a ditch,'' said John Prendergast, a former senior Africa specialist for the government.
 This comes as public outrage, sporadic before, is growing over the continuing bloodshed in Darfur, which the United States characterizes as genocide. States, including Maine, New Jersey and Illinois, and cities and private groups across the United States are cutting financial ties to companies that do business with Sudan. 
 A coalition of advocacy groups called SaveDarfur.org has organized a large rally in Washington for this weekend featuring speakers from Congress, the administration, Hollywood and religious organizations.
 An estimated 200,000 people have died in Darfur since the violence began three years ago, and more than two million others have been driven from their homes. For the administration, the greatest hope centers on the peace talks in Abuja, Nigeria, which have limped along for almost two years. 
 The United Nations and the African Union, sponsor of the talks, have given the government of Sudan and the Darfur rebels until Sunday to reach agreement on a draft treaty that the mediators wrote and handed to both parties on Tuesday. 
 Both sides agreed to look at it but were otherwise noncommittal. While the two sides have agreed on some issues during previous sessions, the remaining disagreements are thick with complexity and emotion. 
 ''We will respect the deadline, and if there are no indications that a deal is possible, we will wind up'' the talks, said Sam Ibok, leader of the African Union mediating team.
 Robert B. Zoellick, the deputy secretary of state, said in an interview on Wednesday, ''There's a fighting chance'' to reach agreement by Sunday. Jan Pronk, the chief United Nations envoy in Sudan, said the mediators might be willing to extend the talks a few days if significant progress was being made, but probably not much more than that. ''It's now or never,'' he said.
 Mr. Zoellick added, ''If there is no peace accord, then it becomes a different mission.''
 The plan to send up to 20,000 United Nations peacekeepers to Darfur, to replace the 7,000 African Union soldiers stationed there now, presents formidable obstacles. 
 The United States and Europe have largely financed the African Union mission, but both have concluded that it is inadequate for the job. In February, the Security Council agreed to begin planning to send United Nations troops. The Bush administration said at the time that it would support the idea of having NATO take the lead in overseeing an interim African Union force until the arrival of United Nations troops.
 But Sudan has remained opposed, and Khartoum has lobbied other African states, with some success, to view the idea as an affront to Sudanese sovereignty. Some of those other states would have to take part in any United Nations mission. 
 Now the Sudanese government is refusing even to grant visas to the United Nations team that wants to visit Darfur to assess the possible mission. But Sudan said it might change its mind if a Darfur peace agreement was reached.
 Mr. Zoellick, in a speech this month to the Brookings Institution, said, ''Either you get approval of the government,'' or ''you invade, and that's a very big, serious challenge.''
 In an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Pronk said Sudan was even more opposed to President Bush's NATO proposal. 
 ''Wise diplomacy,'' Mr. Pronk said, means ''you don't talk about NATO. It is viewed here as intervention, new colonialism.''
 What is more, few countries have expressed any willingness to send forces or equipment as part of the United Nations mission -- and then only if Khartoum agrees. The State Department says Morocco, Pakistan, Ukraine, Russia and others have made tentative commitments.
 ''The United Nations has been flummoxed at every juncture,'' said Mr. Prendergast, who was director for African affairs in the National Security Council during the Clinton administration. Now he is a senior adviser for the International Crisis Group, a nonprofit organization. 
 The conflict in Darfur began in February 2003, when rebel groups attacked government positions, accusing the leaders in Khartoum of ignoring their region. The government struck back with a fury, enlisting local militias to massacre civilians and destroy entire villages. The world was slow to acknowledge the problem, but in September 2004, the Bush administration stated that the carnage constituted genocide. 
 African Union troops began arriving in Darfur last year, and for a while the violence diminished. But in recent months it has picked up with new ferocity and has spread to Chad, where Sudanese militias are raiding Chadian villages along the border. Sudan, a senior administration official said, had also supplied weapons to rebels that attacked Ndjamena, the capital of Chad, earlier this month.
 As he gave the warring groups a copy of the draft Darfur agreement on Tuesday evening, Salim Ahmed Salim, the chief mediator, said: ''This is decision time. No more procrastination, no more antics, no more delaying tactics. The eyes of the world are on you.'' 
 But a senior United Nations official noted another serious problem, even if the parties agreed: the proposed agreement calls for an immediate cease-fire, but the African Union troops in Darfur have already shown they are incapable of enforcing a cease-fire. 
 ''If there are violations on the ground,'' the official said, ''the whole thing could fall apart.''

HEADLINE: The Death of Multiculturalism

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
In 1994 multiculturalism was at its high-water mark, and Richard Bernstein wrote ''Dictatorship of Virtue,'' describing its excesses: the campus speech codes, the forced sensitivity training, the purging of dead white males from curriculums, the people who had their careers ruined by dubious charges of racism, sexism and ethnocentrism.
 Then two years later, the liberal writer Michael Tomasky published ''Left for Dead,'' which argued that the progressive movement was being ruined by multicultural identity politics. Democrats have lost the ability to talk to Americans collectively, Tomasky wrote, and seem to be a collection of aggrieved out-groups: feminists, blacks, gays and so on. 
 At the time, Bernstein and Tomasky were lonely voices on the left, and the multiculturalists struck back. For example, Martin Duberman slammed Tomasky's book in The Nation, and defended multiculturalism: 
 ''The radical redefinitions of gender and sexuality that are under discussion in feminist and queer circles contain a potentially transformative challenge to all 'regimes of the normal.' The work of theorists like Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, Jeffrey Weeks, Marjorie Garber and Judith Butler represents a deliberate systemic affront to fixed modes of being and patterns of power. They offer brilliant (if not incontrovertible) postulates about such universal matters as the historicity and fluidity of sexual desire, the performative nature of gender, and the multiplicity of impulses, narratives and loyalties that lie within us all.''
 Duberman insisted that postmodern multicultural theorizing would transform politics, but today his gaseous review reads as if it came from a different era, like an embarrassing glimpse of leisure suits in an old home movie. 
 That's because over the past few years, multiculturalism has faded away. A different sort of liberalism is taking over the Democratic Party.
 Multiculturalism is in decline for a number of reasons. First, the identity groups have ossified. The feminist organizations were hypocritical during the Clinton impeachment scandal, and both fevered and weak during the Roberts and Alito hearings. Meanwhile, the civil rights groups have become stale and uninteresting.
 Second, the Democrats have come to understand that they need to pay less attention to minorities and more to the white working class if they ever want to become the majority party again. Third, the intellectual energy on the left is now with the economists. People who write about inequality are more vibrant than people who write about discrimination.
 Fourth and most important, 9/11 happened. The attacks aroused feelings of national solidarity, or a longing for national solidarity, that discredited the multiculturalists' tribalism.
 Tomasky is now back with an essay in The American Prospect in which he argues that it is time Democrats cohered around a big idea -- not diversity, and not individual rights, but the idea of the common good. The Democrats' central themes, Tomasky advises, should be that we're all in this together; we are all part of a larger national project; we all need to make some shared sacrifices and look beyond our narrow self-interest. Tomasky is hoping for a candidate who will ignore the demands of the single-issue groups and argue that all Americans have a stake in reducing economic fragmentation and social division.
 Coincidentally, two other liberal writers, John Halpin and Ruy Teixeira, have just finished a long study that comes out in exactly the same place. Surveying mountains of polling data, they conclude that the Democrats' chief problem is that people don't think they stand for anything. Halpin and Teixeira argue that the message voters respond to best is the notion of shared sacrifice for the common good. After years of individualism from right and left, they observe, people are ready for an appeal to citizenship.
 Naturally, this approach has weaknesses. Unlike in 1964, most Americans no longer trust government to be the altruistic champion of the common good, even if they wish it could. And while writers and voters talk about the common good, politicians are wired to think about their team. Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer will never ask their people to make sacrifices, but until they do, the higher talk of common good will sound like bilge.
 Nonetheless, the decline of multiculturalism and the rebirth of liberal American nationalism is a significant event. Democrats are purging the last vestiges of the New Left and returning to the older civic liberalism of the 1950's and early 1960's.
 Goodbye, Jesse Jackson. Goodbye, Gloria Steinem. Hello, Harry Truman.

HEADLINE: Communist Vietnam Lunges for Capitalism's Brass Ring 

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS

DATELINE: HANOI, Vietnam, April 26 

 BODY:
It was Lenin's birthday. The most important Communist Party meeting in five years was under way. And the star of the show was the world's most famous capitalist, Bill Gates.
 The president, the prime minister and the deputy prime minister all excused themselves from the party meeting on Saturday to have their pictures taken with Mr. Gates, who has more star power in Vietnam than any of them.
 When people heard he was in town, hundreds climbed trees and pushed through police lines to get a glimpse of him. He was the subject of the lead article in the next day's newspapers. 
 This is where Vietnam stands today, moving cautiously toward a new version of communism while the people and their leaders lunge eagerly for the brass ring of capitalist development.
 ''That was very symbolic,'' said Le Dang Doanh, an official in the Ministry of Planning, speaking of the reception for Mr. Gates. ''It is a very clear sign of the new mood of society and the people. Everybody wants to be like Bill Gates.''
 It is 20 years since Vietnam, still struggling in the aftermath of war, began a sort of perestroika that has moved it from a strict planned economy to the more helter-skelter mechanisms of the marketplace. In the past decade, it has been putting its economic house in order -- with a bid to join the World Trade Organization this year. And it is now drawing new interest from foreign investors.
 ''You'll find tremendous enthusiasm among the foreign community for Vietnam as the next rising star,'' said Jonathan Pincus, the country representative for the United Nations Development Program.
 He said this was partly because major companies like Microsoft as well as Intel, Canon and Fujitsu were leading the way, and partly because Vietnam was seen as a stable hedge for companies that had invested heavily in China. 
 Since a moment of investor enthusiasm faded a decade ago, he said, Vietnam has improved its legal infrastructure, banking system and regulations, making it a safer and more reliable business environment.
 It has entered into so many agreements with other countries, including the United States, that demand internationally accepted business practices that its economic changes now appear irreversible.
 ''In just about every sector you can think of, there's been an ongoing process of reform,'' Mr. Pincus said.
 The Communist Party Congress that ended Wednesday after re-electing the party's general secretary, Nong Duc Manh, 56, was no longer dominated by the ideological debates of the past but by a drive to become, in Mr. Gates's words, the next Asian economic miracle.
 The party's plan for the next five years aims to increase exports, combat corruption and continue its economic integration with the outside world with a goal of maintaining a growth rate of around 8 percent and creating eight million jobs.
 It is seeking to move into a higher level of manufacturing, including electronics. 
 As Vietnam's leaders balance what they call ''a market economy with socialist orientation,'' they are also reshaping the party's relationship with an increasingly materialistic public.
 About half the population of 83 million was born after the war with the United States ended 31 years ago. Vietnam is very much looking toward the future, not the past.
 Reaching out in an unprecedented way, the party published its draft documents for public discussion early this year and received, by Mr. Manh's count, tens of thousands of comments, suggestions and criticisms from the public. 
 It is not clear whether any of these affected the final report, but publishing the documents was at least a gesture of inclusion in the closed workings of the government.
 Significantly, most of the comments involved ways to improve the party's leadership, rather than challenging its primacy or demanding a multiparty system, said Carlyle Thayer, a specialist on Vietnam at the Australian Defense Force Academy in Canberra.
 When people here say they want more democracy, several analysts said, they are not for the most part calling for political pluralism but for a more open and responsive Communist Party leadership.
 In another response to public opinion, Mr. Manh and other leaders also emphasized combating corruption, a result of news media coverage of a scandal that forced the resignation of the minister of transport recently. 
 And in a sign that the party is distancing itself from its orthodox past, this is the first party congress since the meetings began in 1951 not to invite delegations from foreign Communist Parties, Mr. Thayer said.
 As recently as 2000, the party's general secretary, then Le Ka Phieu, told Bill Clinton that socialism was only in temporary decline and remained the wave of the future. Those words sound odd in today's context.
 When officials talk of socialism today they are more likely to be referring to a downside of economic free play, a widening gap between the very poor, who make up 20 percent of the population, and the toweringly rich, who are growing richer. That social divide has for years been a major concern of the party.
 Vietnam's leaders are known for caution, and as they seek to get communism right, where it failed elsewhere in the world, they hope to get capitalism right as well.
 This mixture of the two systems can produce paradoxical results. A large chunk of Vietnam's foreign exchange earnings comes from $6 billion sent home each year by Vietnamese overseas. Most of these are refugees who fled the victory of the Communists in 1975.

HEADLINE: World Briefing Americas: Cuba: Dissident Roughed Up On Way To Meet U.S. Diplomat

BYLINE: REUTERS

 BODY:
Cuban human rights dissidents charged that Martha Beatriz Roque, a leading dissident and former political prisoner, was punched and roughed up by government supporters on Tuesday as she left her Havana home for a meeting at the residence of the top American diplomat on the island, Michael E. Parmly. Ms. Roque, 60, an economist and a leader of the dissident coalition Assembly to Promote Civil Society, was pushed to the ground in front of her home by a mob, then pursued inside by two or three people, one of whom punched her in the face, according to Elizardo Sanchez, Cuba's best-known political dissident. President Fidel Castro's government has been increasingly staging what it calls ''acts of repudiation'' at dissidents' homes, which Mr. Castro's opponents call police-orchestrated efforts at intimidation. Ms. Roque was imprisoned in 2003 along with 74 other dissidents but was released for health reasons 16 months later. Last year, she organized the largest open meeting of dissidents in Cuba since Mr. Castro came to power in 1959.

HEADLINE: Growth Accelerated in March, But a Slowdown Is Expected

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
The economy ended the first quarter on a high note, according to two Commerce Department reports released yesterday, but economists cautioned that higher energy costs and interest rates might sap some of that vitality.
 Two measures of housing and manufacturing activity rose sharply in March, the Commerce Department said, indicating that the economy picked up steam. The Federal Reserve's beige book report presented a similar upbeat view but noted that higher energy prices were hurting businesses and that home sales were cooling in much of the country.
Analysts said the reports suggested that the economy grew at about a 5 percent annual rate in the first quarter, after a 1.7 percent increase in the fourth quarter. The Commerce Department will release its estimate of gross domestic product for the first quarter tomorrow. 
 ''Neither the economy, nor the housing market has gone flat,'' said Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist for the PNC Financial Services Group. ''But it will continue to deflate a little bit.''
 New-home sales rose to an annual pace of 1.21 million in March, up from 1.07 million the month before and 1.2 million in January. Sales increased in all four regions of the country.
 But the market was weaker when compared with a year ago. The selling rate in March was down from a pace of 1.31 million in March 2005, while the median price -- meaning half the homes sold for more and half for less -- slipped 2.2 percent from a year ago, to $224,200. 
 And the number of unsold homes on the market has grown, rising by 24.4 percent over the last 12 months, to 555,000. At the current sales pace it would take five and a half months to sell those properties, up from 4.2 months a year ago.
 The jump in inventories was the biggest in 33 years, and the drop in prices the steepest since January 2003, said Ian C. Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics.
 Sales ''are going to drop in the next couple of months,'' he said, noting that mortgage applications, an early indicator for the housing market, have fallen 22 percent in 12 months.
 Orders for durable goods, big-ticket products that are meant to last for more than three years, increased by 6.1 percent, to $230.6 billion, after a rise of 3.4 percent in February and a decline of 8.9 percent in January.
 A 71.1 percent increase in orders for civilian airplanes and related parts accounted for a big part of the gain, but the increase in orders was a robust 2.8 percent excluding the transportation sector, which is heavily influenced by the month in which customers place orders for planes with Boeing. Other sectors that showed increases were capital goods, machinery and communications equipment.
 If businesses continue to show such strength they could offset some slowdown that analysts expect in housing and consumer spending, but not all of it, economists said.
 They note that oil prices have risen 18 percent since the start of the year, to $71.93 a barrel, and that the national average price for a gallon of unleaded gasoline has increased sharply, to $2.92, from $2.50 a month ago, according to the American Automobile Association. The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage topped 6.5 percent last week, up from 6.21 percent at the start of the year, according to Freddie Mac.
 ''The economy has shown tremendous resilience in the face of energy prices so far,'' said David Greenlaw, an economist at Morgan Stanley. ''But this latest spike will have a noticeable effect in the next couple of months.''
 An economic slowdown could force the Federal Reserve to end its nearly two-year campaign to raise short-term interest rates, now at 4.75 percent, after just one increase to 5 percent at its meeting on May 10.
 Bond investors believe a second increase, in June, is likely. The yield on the 10-year United States Treasury note rose to 5.10 percent yesterday, from 5.07 percent on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: All in the Planning, and Worth Preserving

BYLINE: By David W. Dunlap. 
E-mail: dunlap@nytimes.com

 BODY:
HOW could something called Blocks not pay respects to Jane Jacobs?
 The idea that city planning should be informed by the city block -- its people, texture, layering, scale and age -- can be traced in good measure to her 1961 book, ''The Death and Life of Great American Cities,'' written while she lived at 555 Hudson Street, a little block between Perry and West 11th Streets peppered with old buildings.
She liked short blocks with a lot of diversity. 
 On Tuesday, she died at age 89 in Toronto, where she had moved in 1968. Along Hudson Street in Greenwich Village, diversity still reigned around the unremarkable three-story structure at No. 555 (''modest'' seems too grandiose a word for it), now home to the Art of Cooking, a cookware and accessories store. Elsewhere on the block are the White Horse Tavern, three restaurants, a cafe, a news dealer and a combination card store, florist and T-shirt shop.
 Farther downtown, Ms. Jacobs's hand can be seen in the redevelopment plan for the World Trade Center. A central tenet of that plan is to break down the super-block site into four smaller blocks through the re-establishment of Greenwich and Fulton Streets.
 It is no coincidence that this framework was developed while Alexander Garvin was vice president for planning at the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. His roommate at Yale gave him a copy of ''Death and Life'' as a Christmas present in 1961. ''It changed my life,'' Mr. Garvin said.
 (Ms. Jacobs was not entirely persuaded that the street grid ought to be restored at the trade center site, according to a 2004 account by Adam Gopnik in The New Yorker.)
 Another example of her influence, Mr. Garvin said, was the neighborhood preservation program that he oversaw as New York's deputy housing commissioner from 1974 to 1978. ''We were trying to save old buildings,'' he recalled, ''which was something I always had an inclination toward but until I read that you needed a mix of old and new buildings to have a healthy neighborhood, it wasn't part of my repertoire.''
 John E. Zuccotti was so taken by ''Death and Life'' that he wrote his Yale Law School dissertation in 1963, ''Some Tools for Mrs. Jacobs,'' on whether diversity could be enforced by zoning. He is now chairman of Brookfield Properties in the United States, whose holdings include enormous buildings on either side of the trade center site.
 ''Her ideas are as pertinent today as when she wrote,'' Mr. Zuccotti said. ''Take our problems down here. We're talking about a 24-hour community, residential uses mixing with office uses, different kinds of commercial uses.''
 Amanda M. Burden, the chairwoman of the City Planning Commission, was in San Antonio on Tuesday to receive an award from the American Planning Association for the new West Chelsea zoning district, which encourages the reuse of the High Line, an abandoned rail viaduct.
 After learning of Ms. Jacobs's death, Ms. Burden reflected on the connection. ''The High Line is about community involvement, neighborhood texture, scale,'' Ms. Burden said, ''and the very, very mixed uses Jane Jacobs celebrated.'' 
 Her name is obviously still worth invoking. Alex Krieger, a professor of urban planning and design at Harvard, was quoted by New York magazine last year as saying that the 5,800-apartment Hudson Garden development for the West Side rail yards, which he prepared for Cablevision in its fight against the proposed Jets football stadium on the same site, was ''in line with 'the Jane Jacobs vision.' ''
 Ms. Jacobs took issue with the notion. Professor Krieger says he never actually put it that way. ''What I remember saying,'' he wrote in an e-mail message, ''was that especially in New York, the former home of Jane Jacobs, the Jets stadium proposal didn't seem compatible with a Jane Jacobs' vision.''
 THAT vision has its limits, he added. ''Though I remain a fan, I would say that her vision of the good city was based too much on an idealized Greenwich Village,'' Professor Krieger wrote. ''That particular lifestyle and neighborhood form does not encompass an urbanizing world of remarkable contrasts and contrasting challenges.''
 But her vision is remarkably enduring, having come from someone without formal training in planning.
 ''She taught us how to look at blocks,'' said Ada Louise Huxtable, who was the architecture critic of The New York Times when Ms. Jacobs was battling Robert Moses and other powerful advocates of urban renewal and slum clearance.
 ''The intimate view of the city and its humanity really is indebted to her,'' Ms. Huxtable said.
 New York returned the favor yesterday. The owner of the Art of Cooking, Kate Humphrey, arrived at work to find several bouquets on the doorstep of No. 555.
 One, a mixture of lilies and daisies and other springtime flowers, carried this unsigned message: ''From this house, in 1961, a housewife changed the world.''

HEADLINE: Terror Jury Hears Talk Of Bombing Subway Stop

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM

 BODY:
A fuller picture emerged yesterday of an alleged plot to bomb the Herald Square subway station and of the Pakistani immigrant charged as its prime author, as prosecutors again played secretly recorded conversations between the man and a police informer. 
 The conversations, played for a jury in federal District Court in Brooklyn, captured the immigrant, Shahawar Matin Siraj, 23, telling the informer he expected that the blast in the subway station would bring down the Manhattan Mall on the street above. 
But in another conversation, he seems to suggest to the informer that the bomb could be as small as a bottle of soda, tossed into a garbage can on the subway station's platform. He said he wanted to bomb the station in the early morning hours to cause only economic damage and kill as few people as possible, but he was willing to let the explosion kill the homeless people who spend the night there.
 These contradictions were among several that emerged from Mr. Siraj's sometimes rambling, disjointed and often angry statements, which also suggested that he has a grandiose view of his own talents as a terrorist plotter. In fact, he offered a critical assessment of al Qaeda, saying its members carry out suicide attacks because they are poor planners.
 ''That is what I don't like about them,'' he said on Aug. 18, 2004, just nine days before he and a co-conspirator, James Elshafay, were arrested and charged in the plot. Mr. Elshafay, 21, has pleaded guilty and is expected to testify.
 Yesterday, jurors listened attentively to the recorded conversations between Mr. Siraj and the police informer, Osama Eldawoody, 50. It was the second day that prosecutors have played selections from more than 30 hours of digital recordings from the summer of 2004.
 Using government transcripts, the jurors seemed to follow the heavily accented conversations carefully, and then one of the prosecutors, Todd Harrison, would question Mr. Eldawoody about the recorded discussions.
 The government has sought to portray Mr. Siraj as a dangerous man bent on carrying out a devastating attack. His lawyers, however, contend that the young man, who came to New York from Karachi, Pakistan, in 1999 to join his parents, was duped. 
 They have said that when a fuller picture is presented, it will be clear that Mr. Siraj was manipulated by the police informer, who they contend orchestrated the plot for money, nearly $100,000 that the Police Department paid him over two years and nine months, much of it while he was working on this case.
 One of Mr. Siraj's lawyers, Martin R. Stolar, has called him ''not the brightest bulb on the chandelier.''
 On the tapes played yesterday, Mr. Siraj seemed to alternate between shrewd, bumbling and bizarre. In one conversation, he told Mr. Eldawoody that he had masqueraded as a homeless man to examine the security in the subway station. He looked for surveillance cameras and, though he saw none, he told Mr. Eldawoody that he could not believe there was not a tighter security cordon.
 ''I cannot find no security over there, it's impossible,'' he said. ''If there is no security, it means there is a high security over there. No security means high security. That's a trap.''
 He also said he would shave his beard and wear New York Yankee apparel to disguise himself for a later surveillance mission.
 At another point in the conversation, he seemed convinced that some sort of plot had been set in motion against a mosque at East 96th Street and Third Avenue in Manhattan.

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE (NYT); Compiled by John Sullivan

 BODY:
The union representing 20,000 City University faculty members, who have been working without a contract since November 2002, announced a tentative 58-month settlement yesterday. The union, the Professional Staff Congress, said the accord includes raises totaling 9.5 percent for 11,000 full-time and 9,000 part-time professors. ''It's the best possible agreement within very tough political and economic constraints,'' said Barbara Bowen, the union's president. The agreement raises sabbatical pay to 80 percent of salary, from 50 percent, and gives nontenured faculty members a paid year to do research without teaching. STEVEN GREENHOUSE (NYT)

HEADLINE: New Rebuilding Plan Leaves Some Wondering What the Big Rush Is 

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The new plan for ground zero calls for the accelerated construction of a sprawling commercial complex: 8.8 million square feet of office space in four towers 58 to 70 stories high. All would open within a year of each other, by 2012.
 Gov. George E. Pataki and others say the conceptual plan, officially approved yesterday by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey after months of gridlock, will rejuvenate Lower Manhattan and ensure that it remains the financial capital of the world.
But some construction and real estate industry executives, and some urban planners, hear echoes of the hoopla surrounding the original World Trade Center project more than 30 years ago. They are questioning whether the rapid building of so much speculative office space would have the same destabilizing consequences for the downtown market as the twin towers had in the 1970's. 
 Some experts are even wondering whether there will be enough steel, concrete and curtain wall to build the four towers by 2012 at the same time that two baseball stadiums, the $2 billion Goldman Sachs headquarters, the $1.7 billion expansion of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, Moynihan Station, 10,000 apartments and various subway projects are under construction. 
 Yesterday, the influential Regional Plan Association and the Fiscal Policy Institute welcomed the plan, but they, like many developers, continued to question the wisdom of building the tallest of the skyscrapers, the 1,776-foot Freedom Tower, intended to be a symbol of the city's resilience.
 They said the tower would stand too far from public transportation and was unlikely to attract corporate tenants, who view it as a potential terrorist target. Some government officials suggested that the site be brought up to street level and then put into mothballs next year.
 ''The Freedom Tower is a disastrous idea that should be scratched,'' said Susan S. Fainstein, a professor of urban planning at Columbia University.
 Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, was far more upbeat. ''This agreement will provide a significant boost to the economy of Lower Manhattan by eliminating much of the uncertainty regarding the area's economic future,'' she said, adding that businesses would be lured by the neighborhood's comparatively low business costs.
 But one thing is certain: the cost of the buildings, now estimated at $6.3 billion, is going to jump. Jones Lang LaSalle, the real estate company advising the Port Authority, has built inflation into the numbers. Construction costs are continuing to escalate, at the rate of 1 percent a month.
 ''I don't know how long it'll continue,'' said Frank J. Sciame, the former chairman of the New York Building Congress, ''but that's the case for the next year or two.''
 The World Trade Center, a 10 million-square-foot office complex built by the Port Authority, opened in late 1970 during one of the worst real estate markets since the Depression. To provide anchor tenants for the 110-story towers, state agencies moved into two million square feet of space in one tower, and the Port Authority took 900,000 square feet in the second.
 The trade center also offered subsidized rents to lure tenants out of surrounding buildings, angering local landlords.
 It was not until the mid-1980's that the state began relocating to other buildings. And a breakthrough came in 1985, when Dean Witter Financial Services leased 24 floors in Tower 2, opening the way for other financial firms. Still, occupancy fluctuated wildly until 1998, when companies fleeing high rents in Midtown pushed the occupancy rate to 98 percent. 
 In late 2002, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg outlined his vision for downtown and drew on some of the lessons of the trade center. He said that it made no sense to rush ahead to rebuild the 10 million square feet of lost office space.
 ''If we are honest with ourselves,'' he said, ''we will recognize that the impact on our city was not all positive. The twin towers' voracious appetite for tenants weakened the entire downtown market.''
 But last fall, Mr. Bloomberg started calling for the ground zero project to accelerate. And the plan approved yesterday moves the completion date for the four office towers to 2012, from 2015. 
 Government agencies -- city, state, federal and the Port Authority -- are expected to account for 25 percent of the 8.8 million square feet, only slightly less space than they took up in the twin towers in 1972.
 ''The need to relocate government offices to the World Trade Center in the 1970's was a sign of the economic failure of that project,'' said David Dyssegaard Kallick, a senior fellow at the Fiscal Policy Institute. ''It would make more sense to ensure that we fully fund the public spaces, like the memorial and the performing arts center. Then, allow for the gradual development of the office space with market demand.''
 One downtown landlord, who expects to lose his government tenant to the new trade center complex, said, ''They're about to make the same mistake they did in the 1970's.'' 
 The executive, who was granted anonymity because he did not want to damage his relationship with his largest tenant, a government agency, predicted: ''They'll pull all the city, state and federal agencies out of other buildings and put them in there. It'll take a long time for other owners to relet their buildings.''
 Barry M. Gosin, chief executive of Newmark Knight Frank, a real estate firm, also said the timetable was too short. ''They'll be competing with themselves,'' he said. ''They should leave a few sites zoned and ready to go when demand dictates.''
 But Bill Rudin, a third-generation developer and a major downtown landlord, said that his family was one of the few in real estate who supported the trade center in 1970 and that he supports the new ground zero plan. He said that while a few downtown companies would move to the new towers, most would come from outside the area. 
 ''There is a need for this type of space,'' he said. ''In the last year or so, we've seen Midtown tighten and companies being priced out. Where are they going to but downtown?''
 Mayor Bloomberg said yesterday that he was still concerned about building all four towers simultaneously, which ''may very well lead to too much office space coming on the market at one time.'' But, he added, the empty holes at the trade center site have become a ''great disincentive to rent downtown.''
 ''On balance,'' the mayor said, ''I'd just as soon get everything going.''
 Still, it may be physically impossible to build all four towers by 2012, as well as the memorial, the museum, the $2 billion PATH terminal and other nearby projects. Even before the accelerated schedule, Charles J. Maikish, executive director of the Lower Manhattan Construction Command Center, estimated that there would be 10,000 to 15,000 construction workers a day on ground zero projects over the next three to five years. 
 The trade center site will be competing for materials and labor with a dozen other major projects, including the extension of the No. 7 subway line on the West Side and the construction of the Second Avenue Subway on the East Side and dozens of apartment buildings. The cost of concrete alone has shot up 15 percent to 20 percent in the past two years, and there are signs of a potential shortage.

HEADLINE: Yanks and Mets Seek Tax Relief

BYLINE: By Richard Sandomir. 
E-mail: sportsbiz@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Yesterday was eight days after New York tax returns were due, but the Internal Revenue Service was still a source of chatter at the City Council. The members of the Council's finance committee weren't fretting about their 1040's, but wondering what would happen if the I.R.S. frowned upon the Yankees' and the Mets' stadium financing plans.
 The issue is whether the government will let the teams use tax-exempt bonds issued by a city agency and make payments in lieu of taxes, known as Pilots. The more tax-exempt financing that is allowed, the lower the cost to the teams. The Yankees want 93 percent of their proposed $930 million in bonds for a new stadium to be tax exempt; the Mets want almost 84 percent of their $632 million financing proposal to be untaxed. 
If the I.R.S. says yes to the city and the teams, the watchdogs at the Independent Budget Office estimate that the Mets will save $105 million through tax-exempt bonds and that the Yankees will save $147 million, or $35 million more than their total obligation to Alex Rodriguez.
 The Council wasn't exactly nibbling its collective nails raw over the I.R.S. The city and the teams are confident of the tax agency's approval and perhaps see a loophole in the regulations. But like most of us who live in fear of audits, or even an envelope with the I.R.S.'s return address, the Yankees, the Mets and the Bloomberg administration wouldn't be pleased by any unhappy federal intrusions into the stadium-building process.
 ''If the I.R.S. rules against it, does it affect the project?'' asked Councilman Michael E. McMahon, a Staten Island Democrat.
 Yes, it does. At the very least it raises the teams' costs and could send Mets and Yankees officials back to the negotiating table to ask the city and the state to add more to their contributions, which seems unlikely.
 ''If there's no tax exemption, there are no Pilots,'' said Councilman David I. Weprin, a Queens Democrat, who is the finance committee's chairman.
 McMahon added, ''And it's back to the drawing board.''
 The finance committee passed the teams' proposals unanimously, and the full Council gave its overwhelming approval, all pending the I.R.S.'s decision, which the city hopes for by June. But who tells that agency what to do?
 The I.R.S. is familiar to baseball fans even if its initials are not as familiar as E.R.A. It was part of the steroid investigation into the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative, or Balco, that has implicated Barry Bonds. Its investigation into the sports memorabilia business snagged Duke Snider, Willie McCovey and Darryl Strawberry for tax evasion. Pete Rose ran afoul of the agency for filing false income tax returns and was sentenced to five months in prison.
 Now, the question is whether the I.R.S. will say yes to the stadium building hopes of the principal owners Fred Wilpon and George Steinbrenner.
 Subsidies of any sort for building stadiums or arenas have been an enduring issue for decades. Senator Daniel P. Moynihan, the maverick New York Democrat, was a sworn enemy of such financing. Ten years ago, with talk of a new stadium for the Yankees looming, as it often did, Moynihan proposed legislation that would have ended the use of tax-free financing by local governments to build ballparks for anybody. 
 ''Building new professional sports facilities is fine by me,'' Moynihan said at the time. ''Let the new stadiums be built. But, please, do not ask the American taxpayer to pay for them.'' 
 The 1986 Tax Reform Act was supposed to do what Moynihan desired -- with a provision that he sponsored -- but cities hired lawyers, lobbyists and bond specialists who discovered elegant ways to get around a provision that sharply limited the use of stadium revenue to pay off tax-exempt bonds. 
 ''It was supposed to reduce or eliminate federal tax subsidies to cities competing against each other,'' said Andrew Zimbalist, a Smith College economics professor and author of ''In the Best Interests of Baseball? The Revolutionary Reign of Bud Selig.'' 
 Some of Moynihan's spirit lives in questions about the Mets' and Yankees' financing proposals. The Independent Budget Office said in a recent report that the Pilots -- which would substitute for property taxes that the new stadiums would not pay -- constitute ''an aggressive interpretation of what investments that largely benefit private entities are eligible for the tax exemption.'' 
 It added that the use of Pilots stretches the definition of the type of general tax that is supposed to pay off tax-exempt bonds.
 Ronnie Lowenstein, the director of the budget office, said her group was not passing judgment.
 ''If this is a way for the city and the teams to save money on building stadiums, fine,'' she said by phone. ''But there was enough concern that the Bloomberg administration asked for an I.R.S. ruling in advance.''

HEADLINE: Property Taxes Rising Too Fast, Report Warns

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 26 

 BODY:
New York State residents are paying the highest property taxes in the country, increasing at triple the rate of inflation over the last five years, according to a report released on Wednesday by the state comptroller. Suburban homeowners, the report said, bear the biggest burden.
 Property taxes, which make up most of a homeowner's tax bills, have climbed by an average of 60 percent over the last decade, according to the report by the comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi. 
The report provides perhaps the most authoritative overview yet of what has emerged as a contentious issue in state politics: property taxes that in some areas can reach into the tens of thousands of dollars per household in the densely populated suburbs near New York City. Much of these increases can be attributed to soaring property values, but rising costs for education, Medicaid and pensions have helped propel these bills.
 But the report found that New York City homeowners fare comparatively well versus suburban homeowners, since the city relies more heavily on income taxes than property taxes to pay for services.
 Over all, the report found that property taxes consume a disproportionate level of New Yorkers' income, 28 percent higher than the national average. 
 ''The increasing tax burden is a sign of our weakening fiscal condition,'' Mr. Hevesi said. ''We are losing our competitive edge, and there will be a day of reckoning. Somebody has got to start thinking about the long term.''
 Not surprisingly, the tax burden falls the most heavily on the suburban counties in the New York metropolitan region, where homeowners routinely pay high taxes to finance their schools.
 Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, Rockland and Putnam Counties have tax burdens per household that are more than double the statewide average. 
 Long Island homeowners have a tax bill of more than $10,000 per household on average, and taxpayers in the Hudson Valley region have a bill of more than $8,000. 
 In Westchester, the overall tax bill has increased by 67 percent in the last decade, with the average bill per household reaching nearly $10,000 annually. But one of the highest increases came in Putnam, where the tax bill has grown by more than 77 percent in the last decade, with the tax bills topping more than $9,000 per household on average. 
 In his report, Mr. Hevesi, a Democrat, praised Gov. George E. Pataki's cap on Medicaid spending for counties, which the comptroller said had slowed the growth of property taxes this year.
 Earlier this year, the comptroller's office issued a report that found that county property taxes increased by about 3.3 percent in 2006, compared with an average annual increase of 7 percent between 2001 and 2005. 
 The state's high tax burden is driven entirely by high property taxes, according to the most recent report, while state taxes are roughly the same as the national average. In the last five years, property tax bills increased by 42 percent, compared with inflation of 13 percent, according to the report. 
 But the report also noted that the high property tax levels in suburban counties outside New York City might not be so burdensome on many residents there, because property values in those areas are so high and residents typically have much larger incomes. 
 Most of the increases can be attributed to increases in taxes to pay for local school districts, the report said. School districts account for 61 percent of the property tax burden outside New York City. In all but the five largest cities in the state, property taxes are the only significant revenue source for school districts. 
 Some critics of high property taxes, including Mr. Pataki, have proposed placing a cap on school spending to limit local taxes, but the State Legislature has rebuffed the idea, saying that such a cap would prevent districts from paying for their fixed costs. 
 ''This is an issue that is an obvious concern, but nobody is confronting the source of it,'' said Edmund J. McMahon, the director of the Empire Center, a conservative fiscal policy group. ''The only solution to that is a cap on school taxes. Unless you do something like that it is absolutely certain to continue.'' 
 Property taxes began creeping upward in the 1990's, with an average annual increase of about 2.3 percent, according to the report. 
 Then, in 1997, Governor Pataki, a Republican, and the Legislature enacted a School Tax Relief program, known as STAR, which allowed homeowners to reduce some of their property taxes and reimburse school districts. But Mr. Hevesi's report said that the program had merely shifted the costs to the state and not had much long-term impact in limiting property taxes.
 ''STAR has had a minimal effect of limiting the tax rate,'' Mr. Hevesi said. ''Its impact is diminished when property rates go up in a short-term sugar rush.''
 But Wednesday, Mr. Pataki defended his STAR plan and criticized the Legislature for rejecting his proposal in this year's budget to tie property tax rebate checks for homeowners to caps in property tax increases. 
 He said that despite increases in education aid for schools across the state, several districts were asking voters to approve property-tax increases in local elections next month. 
 ''That to me is wrong,'' Mr. Pataki said. ''That to me is not just wrong, that is something we should be taking action against.''
 Education advocates have said that any moves to cap school spending would hamstring their efforts to improve technology and keep up with the increasing fixed costs such as pensions and transportation. 
 ''We don't think that arbitrary caps work well,'' said David Ernst, a spokesman for the New York State School Boards Association. ''The costs of the local tax burdens have risen because the largest part of the school budgets are paid by local taxes. The problem is not at the local level.''
 Mr. Hevesi said that while local taxes make up the largest part of property tax bills, the state should come up with a plan to lower taxes, rather than shift the burden of costs from the state to municipalities.

To the Editor:
 Re ''How Not to Cure an Addiction'' (editorial, April 26): 
In fact, Americans' addiction to oil is largely tied to our addictive love of personal vehicles, which clog our cities and highways, pollute our environment, and consume a lion's share of imported oil.
 One immediate way that President Bush and other elected officials can help us kick our oil addiction is to support all forms of public transportation, from Amtrak and regional rail and bus systems, to innovative auto-rental and sharing plans and new ways to use taxi fleets to allow greater use by multiple clients.
 As crazy as it sounds, while gasoline prices are already having a negative effect on our economy, public transportation systems are starved for money and have cut back services and routes, cutbacks that simply push more personal cars, S.U.V.'s and trucks onto roadways and drive up gasoline consumption.

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re your April 26 editorial:
I agree that President Bush is ducking the real issue concerning America's addiction to gasoline. But the most obvious solution is not more regulation in the form of increasing fuel-efficiency standards for ordinary cars, as you propose. On the contrary, it is simply to let gas prices find their own level. 
 As gas prices rise, car users will automatically turn to more economical models and cut out needless trips. Furthermore, alternative forms of energy will become increasingly competitive in simple dollar-and-cent terms.
 And of course, this elegantly simple solution is fully in accord with Mr. Bush's much-trumpeted free-market stance.

HEADLINE: G.E., Betting on the Future, Finances a Solar Farm in Portugal 

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
The sheep that have long grazed on 150 acres of farmland in Serpa, Portugal, will soon have to share their space with the world's largest solar energy plant. 
 Next month the PowerLight Corporation, using $75 million of the General Electric Company's money, will begin installing the first of what will be 52,000 solar panels, capable of generating 11 megawatts of electricity -- enough to light and heat 8,000 homes.
GE Energy Financial Services, the conglomerate's energy financing arm, will own the plant, while PowerLight will continue to run it. The companies expect it to be fully operational in January. 
 Both companies concede that it remains far more expensive to produce energy from sunlight than from fossil fuels, or even wind, and that the plant may not make money right away. 
 ''Solar is not yet highly profitable, but we know we'll get a good payback from this project,'' said Andrew Marsden, managing director of European Operations for GE Energy Financial Services. 
 The Portuguese government, seeking to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil fuels, has introduced legislation that forces utilities to pay 0.31 euro a kilowatt hour for solar energy. 
 Spain and Germany have similar programs, and Italy recently introduced one as well. 
 ''It takes a huge amount of work to develop these projects, to get the permits, to find the modules, and solar energy still costs more than fossil fuels or wind,'' Mr. Marsden said. ''So we are only going to invest in countries with supportive regimes.''
 That list does not yet include the United States. Richard King, a team leader in the Energy Department's photovoltaic research group, said that many homeowners, particularly in California, had installed rooftop panels, as had some Wal-Mart stores and other businesses. But Mr. King conceded that American economics did not yet favor solar energy. He said that people in Portugal and many other parts of Europe were already accustomed to paying 25 cents to 30 cents a kilowatt hour for electricity. 
 In the United States, the cost still averages 10 cents to 14 cents, ''and utilities are just not going to buy 25-cent solar electricity,'' he said. 
 Mr. King said that the Energy Department was already spending about $78 million a year to seek ways to bring down the cost of photovoltaic cells, and that President Bush had asked Congress to authorize an additional $63 million a year. ''We want to mainstream solar energy by 2015, and that means putting it on cost parity with any other source of energy,'' he said.
 Solar panels are arrays of semiconductors that convert light to electricity. The wattage can be used directly in a home or fed into a utility's power grid. 
 PowerLight, which was founded in 1991, already operates three interconnected clusters of solar panels in Bavaria that together generate 10 megawatts of electricity, and is building a 3-megawatt plant in Las Vegas, which will be the largest in the United States. G.E.'s manufacturing arm makes rooftop solar panels that are appearing in California and New Jersey. And Energy Financial Services already has $162 million invested in assorted solar projects that generate about 149 megawatts of electricity. Just this month it invested in new projects to use solar roofs to power two San Diego schools.
 But solar farms remain expensive to build, and a persistent shortage of the purified silicon needed to make solar panels has been a barrier to the industry's growth. 
 Alex Urquhart, the unit's president, said that solar energy was among the areas that his group was actively exploring, but for now, ''The overall picture is still dominated by wind.''
 That may change, though. The silicon shortages are easing, and developing technologies are making solar installations more productive. For example, the PowerLight panels used in the Portugal project track the sun as it moves across the sky, to maximize exposure.

HEADLINE: Senate Diverts War Money To U.S. Border

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 26 

 BODY:
Prodded by Republicans, the Senate voted on Wednesday to trim President Bush's financing request for the Iraq war by $1.9 billion and to use that money to improve border security. 
 The vote, 59 to 39, was on an amendment to an emergency spending measure and was cast on a day of difficult choices for Republicans. They passed up opportunities to strip the bill of provisions unrelated to its primary purpose of paying for hurricane relief and military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.
 The action was unusual because Republicans have been adamant that the war is the highest priority and have been quick to attack Democrats who show signs of wavering on the issue. Three Republicans voted against the shift of money, seven Democrats voted for it and two Democrats did not vote.
 With Mr. Bush promising to veto the $106.5 billion spending measure unless it is pared to less than $95 billion, senators who wanted to improve border security, a cause that grassroots conservatives have declared a main goal this election year, felt they had to do so without letting the underlying bill expand.
 ''This bill is about national defense, especially relative to terrorism,'' said Senator Judd Gregg, the New Hampshire Republican who is the amendment's lead sponsor. ''And, yes, fighting the war in Iraq is critical to this war on terrorism. Fighting the war in Afghanistan is critical to this war on terrorism. But I have to think equally important is making sure that our borders are secure.''
 The amendment would provide money to the Border Patrol and Coast Guard for new airplanes, helicopters, patrol boats and communications equipment. Democrats criticized the proposal as ''a false, cheap choice to secure political points,'' in the words of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York.
 The debate exposed a widening rift among Republicans on fiscal policy, in particular the special projects called earmarks. Those splits forced the House Republican leadership this month to abandon its effort to pass a budget. Now they are complicating the debate on the emergency spending bill, known in Senate lexicon as a supplemental, and threatening to derail lobbying bills in the House.
 In the Senate, 35 Republicans, enough to sustain a veto, signed a letter on Wednesday saying they would back Mr. Bush if he decided to veto the bill. Senator George Allen of Virginia, who like many other Republicans is campaigning for re-election on a theme of fiscal restraint, was among the signers. 
 ''I think an emergency supplemental ought to deal with only emergency matters,'' Mr. Allen said.
 Republicans fought over what, if anything, to strip from the bill, and some of the senators who said they would sustain the veto also rejected an effort by conservatives to restore the bill to Mr. Bush's original request. That vote, 72 to 26, retained provisions for farm subsidies, aid for the fisheries industry and a $700 million proposal to relocate a freight railroad in Mississippi.
 The train project has the strong backing of Senator Thad Cochran, the Mississippi Republican who is chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. 
 It has drawn intense complaints from other Republicans, notably Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma. A move by Mr. Coburn to strike the project from the bill failed, 49 to 48.

HEADLINE: Gas Prices, So Far, Aren't Prompting Many Resort Discounts

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
IT'S already hard to pull up to a gas pump without wincing, and to hear the energy prognosticators tell it, gas prices are not going to tumble down any time soon. But although that may give pause to anyone planning a long family-driving vacation, it is causing remarkably little angst among the larger hotels, theme parks and other destination spots that rely on drive-in trade.
 Sure, many of the gas vouchers and discount cards that inns and tourist-dependent towns have been offering every summer are available again now. But there are precious few new incentives to be found. Parks like Disney World and hotel chains like Hilton's Hampton Inns came through the last gas-price spikes unscathed, and they say they are anticipating little fallout now. And, since the destinations and attractions do not expect to share their guests' pain, precious few have plans to ease it.
''The demand for hotel rooms has been so strong, across all price points and locations, that the hotels just don't really need any big promotions,'' said Steven E. Kent, the hospitality industry analyst at Goldman Sachs. 
 Simply put, the law of supply and demand is on the hospitality industry's side. According to PricewaterhouseCoopers, the supply of hotel rooms in this country will grow a paltry 1.1 percent this year, and demand for those rooms will go up 2.9 percent. Even more telling, the firm's continuing surveys of would-be travelers keep turning up the same results: Everyone is concerned about high gas prices, but not enough to cancel vacations. 
 ''Maybe they'll budget for a less expensive dinner, but they'll still go,'' said Bjorn Hanson, who heads the PricewaterhouseCoopers hospitality consulting practice. ''The negative effect of gasoline prices will be overwhelmed by the strength of the economy and the limited amount of new supply.''
 There are some bargains to be had, of course. Branson, Mo., a heavily tourist-dependent town, where 87 percent of visitors arrive by car, is for the third year offering a ''Gas Buster'' card, good for a total of $50 worth of discounts at local hotels, restaurants and shops, to anyone who can show receipts for $40 worth of gas bought in the 48 hours before arrival. 
 Aspen, Colo., too, is again offering a $50 gas voucher, free parking, free bike rentals and assorted passes to attractions to anyone who books two nights of lodging in advance. 
 And some voucher programs are kicking in earlier, and lasting longer. Last year and in 2004, about 100 inns, spread across the country, participated in ''Tanks a Lot,'' a program offering gas vouchers and assorted discounts and special discounts in June. This year, more than 60 inns began offering discounts in April, and Marti Mayne, a spokeswoman for BedandBreakfast.com, the promotional Web site that coordinates the program, said that many inns would extend the incentives well into the fall. 
 LARGER hotels and theme parks may still come out with promotions as the summer gets closer, too. But it is not looking likely. Not one hotel or spa has asked the Automobile Club of New York to tell members of any incentives to compensate for high gasoline prices, the club says. That pattern -- or lack thereof -- is holding nationally. ''We're watching this issue to see how it plays out, but our parks and resorts have not been noticeably impacted by high or rising gas prices,'' said Donn Walker, senior manager of media relations for Walt Disney Parks and Resorts. 
 National hotel chains are sounding a similar theme. Kendra Walker, a spokeswoman for Hilton, said there were no plans for price sweeteners to lure drivers to Hampton Inns or other properties that cater to the drive-in trade. Marriott, which offered gas-discount cards at some hotels a year ago, does not have such plans now. 
 Choice Hotels International, which owns Comfort Inns and Econo Lodge and several other brands that cater to driving vacationers, has occasionally offered gas-price-related discounts, but also has no plans to do so now. ''We aren't seeing any great downturn in occupancy rates or softening of travel demand due to the rising gas prices,'' said Wayne Wielgus, the chain's chief marketing officer. ''People may travel 300 miles instead of 400, but they're still traveling.''
 The AAA, which tracks automobile travel, expects that people will continue to take driving vacations, no matter what happens at the pumps this summer. ''Our experience tells us that the high price of fuel does not erode the number of Americans who travel during the summer,'' said Geoff Sundstrom, a spokesman for the AAA. ''People have a certain amount of time from the job, the kids are out of school, and they'll cut back on other spending before they'll cancel a vacation they've been looking forward to.''
 That does not mean that tourist spots or hotels are ignoring the psychological impact that $3-plus gas can have on visitors. Their marketers know that, even though expensive gas probably adds $60, tops, to the cost of a 500-mile vacation, it still gets people worrying about budgets. So, they are taking steps to temper the fears with a dose of reality.
 That's certainly Florida's approach. Last year's high gas prices certainly did not keep vacationers away from Florida. According to VisitFlorida, the state tourism marketing organization, 85.8 million visitors came through, marking the first time the state exceeded the 80-million-visitor mark. And it expects a 3 percent increase in visitors this year. 
 Still, after gas prices hit record highs in September, VisitFlorida began promoting Florida on Foot, a list of pedestrian-friendly destinations reachable by public transportation. And it put a fuel calculator on its Web site. Drivers can plug in the length of a planned trip and the mileage their cars usually get per gallon and figure out the total cost at various gas prices.
 ''That way, people will see for themselves that the difference between gas at $2 a gallon or $3 a gallon is still a nominal part of the vacation's cost,'' said Vanessa M. Welter, VisitFlorida's director of communications. 
 Chains that cater to lower-income vacationers are also hedging their bets. Accor North America, which owns the budget-priced Motel 6 and Studio 6 chains, has not introduced any new discount programs to ease the pain of gas-price rises. But it is more aggressively promoting the discount programs it has long had.
 Normally, discount-related advertising makes up about 40 percent of Accor's commercials; now the mix is half and half, and Eric Studer, Accor's senior director of advertising and marketing services, says it may soon tip even further toward the discount ads. 
 ''We don't see any indication of any big drop-off in people's travel plans, but we do realize that gasoline probably takes up a bigger percentage of the travel budget for low-income families,'' he said.
 That's the attitude at La Quinta hotels, too. Angelo Lombardi, the chain's chief operating officer, said its advance bookings presage a pretty good summer. Still, he said, La Quinta is tinkering with its advertising mix: less emphasis on the chain's high-speed Internet and king suites, more on the convenience of booking through the Web site. Mr. Lombardi does not rule out possible discounts or other special offers, either.
 ''When you have 500 hotels, there are always going to be some empty rooms,'' he said, ''and we will make efforts through our marketing to make La Quinta a more likely choice for the leisure driving traveler.'' 
 IN fact, some destinations are trying to make the psychologically chilling effect of $3 gas work in their favor. South Dakota's Office of Tourism is offering a $20 voucher on its Web site that drivers in the 10 nearest states can download and cash in for ethanol-enhanced gasoline. A lot of ethanol is made in South Dakota, ''so we wanted to show empathy toward cost-conscious drivers as well as educate a larger audience about a product made here,'' said Billie Jo Waara, director of South Dakota's Office of Tourism. 
 This year in Missouri, the Branson Lakes Area Chamber of Commerce, which administers the Gas Buster card program, added two additional sweeteners: 22 weekly drawings for a $100 gas voucher card, and a one-time drawing, on Sept. 30 -- when the program officially ends -- for a three-night vacation for four.
 No one at the chamber thinks that high gas prices have kept, or will keep, tourists away. Indeed, the stream of visitors to Branson has inched up steadily in recent years, to 7.3 million last year from 7.1 million in 2002. Instead, the chamber is hoping that the promotion will put Branson on more people's mental maps.
