HEADLINE: Your Money Some Tax Breaks On Falling Stocks

BYLINE: By Jan M. Rosen

 BODY:
For many investors, it may be time to trim the sails. Since stocks and bonds have taken a pounding in recent weeks, many portfolios have losers. While the sentiment may be to hold on, what can be salvaged represents a tax loss.
Of course, as astute investors know, trading should be based on economics, not on taxes. So is a tax loss really a reason to sell? Or doesn't it make sense to hold on to a security that still has sound fundamentals? 
Certainly cases can be made to hold or even buy particular issues. But professionals contend that from a market perspective, as well as a tax perspective, substantial selling makes sense with the Dow Jones industrial average down about 600 points since flirting with 3,000 in July.
''It's silly to pay taxes when you're holding losses,'' said Martin Jaffe, senior vice president and chief operating officer of Wood, Struthers & Winthrop, the investment management unit of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. ''We see great volatility over the near term and there will be opportunities to buy great companies at low prices.''
''We're in the early stage of a recession; make no doubt about it,'' said Kurt Brouwer, president of Brouwer & Janachowski Inc., a San Francisco investment advisory firm. ''Typically, the market gets beaten pretty badly in the early stages.''
Under the tax laws, there is no limit to the amount of capital losses that can offset capital gains, but only $3,000 of net capital losses can be taken against ordinary income; any excess must be carried forward to future years.
Thus, a taxpayer earning $75,000 a year whose portfolio had $20,000 in losses and $30,000 in gains could see his income reduced to $72,000 for tax purposes by selling the losers and taking gains of $17,000. If he sat on the losses, in the hope those issues would bounce back, but took $15,000 in gains, his adjusted gross income would rise to $90,000.
Tim Kochis, who is in charge of executive financial consulting for Deloitte & Touche, noted that some taxpayers are reluctant to sell winners now because they hope President Bush will prevail in his call for more favorable tax treatment on capital gains, and if they are lucky enough to have only winners, that may be an incentive to wait.
''If there are losses larger than $3,000, take the bird in hand,'' he said. That is, sell the losers and use the opportunity to take whatever offsetting gains can be taken tax-free this year.
''Given the current uncertainty about what Congress will finally do, there may not be more favorable treatment,'' Mr. Kochis added. He predicts that there is no chance of a lower capital gains rate passing this year and less than a 50 percent chance in 1991. He even sees the possibility of ''some deterioration in the treatment of capital losses, which would argue for taking them this year.''
Mr. Jaffe pointed out for those who really like a security, despite a loss posiiton, ''a lot of stocks are fungible.'' A stockholder could sell one bank stock with a loss and buy shares of a similar bank, or sell Ford and buy G.M.
''Scour fixed-income portfolios,'' he added. ''A lot are down. Do what is known as a bond swap.''
The two issues must be different to meet wash-sale rule. If a substantially identical issue is purchased within 30 days, a taxpayer cannot take a capital loss on the sale. This rule does not apply to capital gains, making it possible to sell winners and buy them back at any time to get a higher cost basis, thus limiting future capital gains taxes.
Mr. Jaffe had two caveats, however. One is to avoid excessive trading because transaction costs ''will eat up profits.'' The other is, ''We would not be stock buyers right now.''
''People who are living on their portfolios should look hard,'' he added, because many dividends look vulnerable. He cited bank stocks in particular.
''It's crazy for them to pay 8 or 9 percent,'' he said, given their loan problems. His firm's asset allocation at present is 45 percent in equities and 55 percent in Treasury issues. ''There is no reason to buy corporates,'' he said. ''The difference in yield is not enough to take the risk.''
Mr. Brouwer said, ''We think there is a possibility of another 10 to 15 percent slide in this market.'' People should not wait until the last moment to take tax losses, he added, or their losses are likely to be bigger than they are now.
By the first or second quarter of next year he expects to see opportunities for long-term profits by buying both stocks and bonds that are likely to be ''ridiculously oversold.''
''For someone who is not invested in stocks, we think it's worth dipping your toes in,'' he said, stressing the word dipping, while keeping a strong cash position. ''You can buy at a 20 percent discount'' from the end of last year, he noted, suggesting the Pennsylvania Mutual Funds, T. Rowe Price International and International Discovery funds.

HEADLINE: Kodak Told It Must Pay $909 Million

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
In the largest award ever in a patent-infringement case, a Federal judge ruled yesterday that the Eastman Kodak Company must pay the Polaroid Corporation $909.4 million for infringing Polaroid's patents for instant photography.
Despite the size of the judgment, the decision represents something of a victory for Kodak, since it is well below the $12 billion sought by Polaroid and the $1.5 to $2 billion that some financial analysts had expected.
''This is very positive for Kodak,'' said Eugene Glazer, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds. ''It isolates the major element of risk. It is a manageable number and allows management to plan for the future without wondering if they will have to deal with a multibillion-dollar award.'' 
 
Instant Photo Patents
Kodak was found guilty of infringing seven of Polaroid's instant photography patents after a trial in 1985. The decision forced Kodak out of instant photography the following year, but left open the question of how much economic damage Polaroid had suffered.
Polaroid indicated that it might appeal the award.
The award, by Judge A. David Mazzone of Federal District Court in Boston, easily exceeded the $205 million that Smith International was ordered to pay Baker Hughes Inc. in 1986 in an oilfield equipment case. The two companies actually settled for $95 million. The largest actual payment in such a case was the $125 million paid by three baking companies to Procter & Gamble in 1989 for infringing soft-cookie formulas.
Polaroid contended that it lost profits of $4 billion as a result of Kodak's entry into the instant photography business in 1976. Kodak willfully stole its technology, Polaroid argued, and asked that the damages be trebled to $12 billion.
 
Copying Was Denied
Kodak, which denied deliberately copying Polaroid's technology. contended that interest in instant photography flagged after its cameras were introduced and that Polaroid's losses were no more than $150 million. Kodak said that with interest, the award should have been less than $200 million.
''This will be a disappointment to Polaroid,'' said David Nelson, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. ''The decision means that the judge accepted the most significant part of Kodak's case.''
In his decision, Judge Mazzone ruled that actual damages to Polaroid totaled $454.2 million. The final figure includes interest payments of $455.3 million, to compensate Polaroid for the delay from the time when the losses were suffered and the original judgment was made.
In a statement, Kodak's chairman, Kay R. Whitmore, said the award ''will have no material financial impact on the company and will be paid from earnings.'' He said the award was ''substantially more that the amount to which Polaroid is entitled,'' but added that the decision ''established that our infringement was not intentional and not due to any willful act on the part of Kodak.''
In a statement, I. MacAllister Booth, the president and chief executive of Polaroid, said, ''Considering the significance of the injury to the company and its shareholders, we will review the decision and all relevant factors to determine what steps the company will take.'' Awaiting 'Final Resolution'
Mr. Booth said the company was also considering how to carve up the final amount it is paid. He said the company ''will not announce how we plan to apply the proceeds, when received, until there is final resolution of this litigation.''
Judge Mazzone's decision came after the close of the stock market yesterday, and some analysts predicted that Polaroid's shares would fall when trading resumes on Monday and that Kodak's are likely to rise. ''This will take $4 or $5 out of Polaroid, but it will probably add $2 to $2.50 to Kodak,'' said B. Alex Henderson, an analyst with Prudential-Bache.
Both companies are widely held. Kodak, which has annual sales of $18 billion, has about 172,000 stockholders and Polaroid, which is much smaller with sales of about $1.9 billion, has about 21,000. Polaroid has said it will give at least one-fourth of any award between $750 million and $1.2 billion directly to shareholders.
Polaroid's approximately 11,000 employees also stand to gain. Under their profit-sharing plan they would receive about 10 percent of the award for profits lost because of the Kodak infringement. The award brings closer to an end a battle that began in April 1976, when Kodak introduced a line of instant cameras. Polaroid filed suit six days later, charging that Kodak infringed 10 patents, most involving technology in Polaroid's SX-70 system, which had been introduced in 1972.
 
Market Peaked in 1978
At the time, instant photography was a rapidly expanding market and the technology promised lucrative financial rewards. But the market peaked in 1978 as the growth of one-hour film processing shops and advances in 35-millimeter cameras dimmed the allure of rapidly developing photographs.
Polaroid pressed the litigation nonetheless, and in 1985 Judge Rya Zobel ruled that Kodak had infringed seven of the patents cited by Polaroid.
In addition to the award to Polaroid, Kodak faced a class-action lawsuit by people who had bought its instant cameras before 1986, when Judge Zobel ordered it to stop production of cameras and instant film. Kodak settled the suit in 1988 by establishing a $150 million fund to compensate owners of the orphaned cameras, including cash payments of $50 to $70, depending on the cost of the model purchased.

HEADLINE: Outlook Rather Glum Among Executives

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOT SPRINGS, Va., Oct. 12

 BODY:
The top executives of several dozen of America's largest corporations, gathered here for the twice-yearly meeting of the Business Council, are nervous to gloomy about the economy and appalled by the discord in Washington over how to cut the Federal budget deficit.
A few executives, casting aside quibbling about whether statistics proved a recession had started, said they had little doubt that the economy was already declining.
''I don't know the definition - if it's two quarters or whatever you want to have it - but it feels like one,'' said John F. Welch Jr., chairman and chief executive of the General Electric Company. He said his company's sales of long-lasting consumer goods like washers and dryers, were particularly being hurt. 
Some others here went so far as to predict that a recession would be longer and deeper than most economists have said.
The Business Council is made up of 100 chief executives of the top American industrial and commercial companies. In a report issued here, senior economists from 19 corporations predicted slow economic growth through the middle of next year and a significant chance of a recession.
But at a news conference late Thursday afternoon and in interviews today, executives agreed that some industries have not been hit by the slowdown and may not be soon. Mr. Welch and Edmund T. Pratt Jr., the chairman and chief executive of Pfizer Inc., said sales of medical equipment and other health-care products and services were strong. A positive view also came from George M. C. Fisher, the president and chief executive of Motorola Inc., which produces communications equipment and semiconductors. ''From my vantage point, in our business, I don't see that we're in a recession,'' he said.
Many executives expressed dismay at the inability of Congress and President Bush to enact a Federal budget for the fiscal year that began on Oct. 1. ''It's hard to talk about this without getting mad,'' said David Kearns, chairman of the Xerox Corporation. ''It is a fiasco.''
Kenneth H. Olsen, the president and chief executive of the Digital Equipment Corporation, said that after a decade of wrangling over the deficit, he was pessimistic about the chances for a solution. ''It's going to get worse,'' he said.
 
Budget and Middle East
The consensus seemed to be that a significant decrease in the budget deficit and a resolution of tensions in the Middle East were needed to aid the economy. William W. Boeschenstein, the chairman and chief executive until two weeks ago of Owens-Corning Fiberglas Inc. in Toledo, Ohio, said a budget agreement was needed to allow the Federal Reserve to drive down interest rates, making it easier for companies to borrow.
Several executives, including James D. Robinson 3d, the chairman and chief executive of the American Express Company, called for such a looser monetary policy, but without linking it explicitly to a budget agreement. ''The Fed, we believe, will in fact be able to and should bring down the cost of money,'' he said. ''Inflation is not the No. 1 problem out there.''
The corporate economists' report forecast that economic growth would average less than 1 percent from the middle of 1990 through the middle of 1991 before accelerating to 2.5 percent in the second half of the year.
The United States Chamber of Commerce and Merrill Lynch have said a recession has already begun, but the council's economists said in their report that inventories remained low and that strong growth in exports should support the economy.
The corporate economists prepared their forecast last month, and mentioned in their report that an informal poll taken at a meeting on Oct. 2 found that the majority had subsequently lowered its growth expectations further. Business Council members like Lewis T. Preston, the former chairman of J. P. Morgan & Company, contended that a recession had already begun, adding, ''I'm afraid that it's going to be a little longer and a little deeper'' than the council's economists anticipate.
Several executives were concerned that a loss of confidence by the public might make matters worse. ''Please don't say I have a long face; I didn't have a long face,'' said John S. Reed, the chairman and chief executive of Citicorp. Although pessimistic, he did smile occasionally, and expressed optimism that the economy would improve if the budget stalemate and the Persian Gulf crisis were resolved.
Willard C. Butcher, the chairman and chief executive of the Chase Manhattan Bank, said the bank's credit card division was already ''seeing a modest increase across the country in delinquencies.''
Chief executives and their economists agreed that oil prices probably would not remain at $40 a barrel. Extra production from Saudi Arabia and other countries, combined with the reduced demand that accompanies higher prices, has made up for the loss of Iraqi and Kuwaiti production, said Allen E. Murray, the chairman, president and chief executive of the Mobil Corporation.
''We have absolutely ridiculous crude prices at this stage,'' as a result of heavy buying on war fears, he said. ''I believe crude prices will come down and come down hard.''

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Up Sharp 1.6%

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 12

 BODY:
A record surge in gasoline prices helped push the nation's Producer Price Index up by a sharp 1.6 percent in September, the Labor Department said today.
Coming on top of a 1.3 percent jump in August, producer prices had their biggest two-month rise since 1980.
Gasoline prices jumped 20.6 percent, the biggest rise in a statistical series dating back to 1947.
The overall increase in prices last month, although only slightly higher than expected, combined with a Commerce Department report on September retail sales to compound an already serious policy problem at the Federal Reserve. The central bank seeks an opportunity to cut interest rates in an effort to help ward off or soften a recession but it fears to do so at a time of sharply rising inflation. 
 
Scant Increase for Sales
Retail sales climbed 1.1 percent, but if automobiles and gasoline are excluded, the gain is a scant two-tenths of 1 percent. This means that the sales volume of non-automotive goods actually fell when price rises are factored out. [Page 37.] Car sales held up fairly well in August and September but many specialists said this mostly reflected financial incentives and other end-of-model-year promotional activity.
The fact that the bulk of the acceleration in the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods came from a jump in oil prices that could be short-lived if the situation in the Persian Gulf calms is only partly reassuring, analysts said. Also only superficially encouraging is the fact that, excluding energy, the index rose only two-tenths of 1 percent.
 
Higher Prices Take Hold
Analysts took little comfort from these situations because higher oil prices are already becoming embedded in the economy.
Next Thursday's report on the Consumer Price Index, for example, will be used to set cost-of-living adjustments for tens of millions of people receiving Social Security and other Federal benefits. With the effects of a second month of extra-high oil prices included, the adjustment is expected now to be somewhat more than 5 percent, up from 4.7 percent, for 1990.
The higher oil prices, which have nearly doubled since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, have also become a factor that is substantially eroding the purchasing power of American consumers, leaving them with less money for other things.
''Consumers aren't going to be spending very much during the next three to five months,'' said Edward Guay, an economist for the Cigna Corporation, the Connecticut-based insurer. He added that while the economy probably eked out a gain in the third quarter, a downturn of some kind was now in the works. The Commerce Department will not report its first estimate of this summer's gross national product until Oct. 30.
The Federal Reserve is currently understood to be divided between those who want to give the economy a hefty stimulus when a suitable deficit-reduction budget deal is assured and more cautious members agonizing not only about the high inflation but also about both a weak dollar that could make future inflation worse and high overseas interest rates.
The White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, responded to today's price data by saying that ''inflation going up is never good news'' and he made only the mildest plea for easier money. ''We still are concerned about growth and about preventing a recession,'' he said. ''We think the Fed has recognized all these factors and is on the right course.'' 11.7 Percent Annual Rate September's 1.6 percent jump in the index for finished goods, which covers prices received by domestic producers for goods moving to the ultimate user, raised the third-quarter annual rate to 11.7 percent.
Overall energy prices, which rose 9.5 percent in August, jumped another 13.8 percent in September, the biggest one-month increase since the Government began such a tabulation in 1974. Fuel oil soared 21.3 percent.
But food prices restrained the price index's rise. Consumer foods fell nine-tenths of 1 percent, slightly more than their August increase, as prices fell for beef and veal, eggs, fresh vegetables, shortening and pasta, and declines accelerated for dairy products and pork.
New-car prices rose 3.4 percent, but seasonal adjustment factors accounted for most of this. The actual increase was only two-tenths of 1 percent.
With food and energy excluded, prices for finished goods rose six-tenths of 1 percent, double the August increase and causing some analysts to fret about a possible sustained increase in this so-called core rate.
But Michael L. Penzer, a senior economist at the Bank of America, predicted that, long term, the core inflation rate would continue to decline. For the latest 12 months, prices have still risen only 3.7 percent, compared with 4.3 percent a year ago, because of a soft manufacturing sector. Over all, ''the economy is getting steadily weaker,'' Mr. Penzer said.
Surging oil prices also dominated the indexes for goods at the intermediate and crude stages of production, which climbed by 1.8 percent and 4.6 percent, respectively. Excluding energy, intermediate materials rose four-tenths of 1 percent and crude goods fell 1.3 percent.
Among the widely watched components of the intermediate goods index, prices rose faster than in August for such nondurable manufacturing items as paint materials, paper, nitrogenates and resins, many of which are oil products.

HEADLINE: Taxi Commission Investigates Medallion Pricing and Loans

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission and three other city agencies are investigating complaints that taxi-medallion brokers and lenders are selling the medallions at prices far above the prevailing market rate to unsuspecting buyers.
The commission also said that some lenders and brokers were buying interests in medallions and then selling those interests to others without paying the transfer tax, which is 5 percent of the sales price, and without notifying the commission or the Department of Finance, as they are required by law. The commission said documents filed with the city were often falsified to avoid the tax. 
The commission also is concerned about ''conditional sales'' of medallions, many of them to immigrants who have no credit or financial sophistication or who cannot afford a down payment for a traditional bank loan.
In these sales, the buyers take out installment-type loans with the sellers but without building up equity in the loan. If they miss a payment they can lose everything they paid. If the loan can be refinanced, it may be offered at higher interest rates.
The sellers argue that these arrangements are legal and help people who would otherwise not be able to get started in the taxi industry. But the commission is trying to make buyers aware that they may be paying much more than they should.
 
Medallions Sold at Auctions
In one case cited by the commission, a buyer paid $138,000 for a medallion in August, while the market price was about $125,000.
Under procedures established by law, when a medallion is lost because of a loan default, the lender can try to sell the repossessed medallion at a public auction to recoup the unpaid amount of the loan. Brokers acting as middlemen between buyers and sellers bid on behalf of a client.
The investigation found that some people who agreed to buy medallions through private financing with brokers lost tens of thousands of dollars and their right to the medallion because they defaulted on the loans.
Lenord Desir, 52, of Richmond Hill, Queens, said that he lost more than $100,000 over eight years when he took part in such an agreement to buy a medallion. Mr. Desir said he was unable to make payments on the medallion loan because of a heart condition that prevented him from driving a taxi. ''It's not fair after all the money I paid into the medallion to be left with absolutely nothing,'' he said.
Jack S. Lusk, the commission's chairman, said that while the agency had documented only a handful of such cases, he believed the overpricing of medallions and sales-tax evasion are widespread, and he has proposed new regulations to curb them.
The proposed rules would essentially require medallion transactions, financing agreements, and private auctions to be supervised by the commission. Medallion buyers would also be required to take a commission-sponsored seminar on proper buying procedures. The city Departments of Investigation, Finance and Consumer Affairs are also involved in the investigation.

HEADLINE: Budget Fight: Stakes High; Numbers Clash

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
On the very same day last week that Mayor David N. Dinkins announced that he was considering 15,000 layoffs to close $1.7 billion in budget gaps over two years, Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman painted a much grimmer picture of the city's fiscal health.
The potential budget deficits, she said, could be twice as large - $3.3 billion - and the city's troubles were far worse.
These dire but conflicting pronouncements from the city's top two fiscal officers helped create a sense that the city was spinning toward its worst fiscal crunch in a decade - a sense that spilled from City Hall to the financial markets.
The differences represent more than a political or bureaucratic skirmish. Numbers like these will be used to determine how many city workers will be laid off, how deeply services will be cut and how high taxes will rise in the months ahead. 
 
Vastly Different Assessments
Behind the clashing numbers are vastly different assessments by the Mayor and the Comptroller over how bad the New York City economy will get and how skilled the administration will be at holding down the cost of labor contracts soon to be settled.
While the administration has pledged to hold the line on labor settlements - so that they cost taxpayers no more than a 1.5 percent increase already included in the budget - the Comptroller's analysis assumes that settlements will cost taxpayers hundred of millions of dollars more over the two years.
And while the Dinkins administration is expecting some weakening in the economy, Ms. Holtzman is presenting one of the most gloomy economic forecasts seen so far, predicting a loss of nearly 100,000 private sector jobs next year. That, in turn, she said, would cause a decline of $730 million in income and sales tax collections over two years.
Philip R. Michael, the New York City Budget Director. said he did not think Ms. Holtzman's ''numbers link to the reality as we now know it.''
''They can speculate about a labor settlement; we can say this is not going to be the cost of the labor settlement,'' Mr. Michael said, ''We are looking at actual collections; they are making judgments.''
Asked about the differences, Ms. Holtzman said, ''We are all predicting the future, and no one has a monopoly on wisdom when you are predicting the future.''
 
Produced in a Hurry
Ms. Holtzman defended her estimates but acknowledged that the report was rushed out last week because of increasing concern over fiscal developments. It was released before her staff had a chance to analyze or include some taxes, on business and real-estate transactions, that the administration said would decline by $450 million over the two-year period.
''If we are right about the income tax and they are right about the business taxes, it could be even worse,'' she said.
After several days of dueling numbers, Mayor Dinkins and Ms. Holtzman met at the end of last week and agreed to have their staffs work together to sort out their differences. Yet some differences remain, officials said.
Behind the abrupt surfacing of fiscal worries are months of warnings of deficits by outside observers.
In June the city approved a $28 billion budget for the 1991 fiscal year, which began on July 1. At the same time, the administration produced a financial plan showing a $30 billion budget for the following year, including a $970 million gap to be closed mainly with productivity improvements and uncertain state aid.
 
'Structural Imbalance' Seen
At the time, State Comptroller Edward V. Regan warned that the 1991 budget could end up with a $500 million deficit, while the deficit the following year could reach $1.9 billion. The State Financial Control Board, which monitors city finances, also warned of a $1.9 billion deficit in 1992.
''The city has reached a critical point at which it must redress the structural imbalance between the programs it wants to provide and what it can afford,'' the board's report said.
While those lengthy detailed reports received little attention, Ms. Holtzman's 17-page study, issued during a week of fiscal uncertainty, captured the public's attention.
To get it out so quickly, her staff said, they took details on the labor settlement and cost figures for Mr. Dinkins's police hiring plan from the newspapers, making an occasional mistake along the way.
''It was not news,'' Alair Townsend, a former city budget director said of the Comptroller's report. ''But timing was everything, in a week when everybody's worst-case scenario with respect to a settlement for at least one labor union came true.''
 
Revenue Differences
A major difference between Mr. Dinkins and Ms. Holtzman came in estimates of tax revenues. While the Comptroller predicted sharp declines in income and sales taxes, the administration predicted that collections of those taxes would be unchanged, despite the worsening economy.
Mr. Michael said that the city's forecast assumed a stagnant economy with no growth in the labor force. Even if the number of jobs declined, he said, his experts predicted that this decline would likely be offset by higher wages.
But the Comptroller's staff predicted a far greater decline in the number of jobs. It noted that nearly 8,000 private-sector jobs were lost each month in June, July and August, and assumed that a similar job loss next year would cost the city nearly 100,000 jobs. One city budget official said that this represented all the jobs the city had gained since 1974.
''It is safe to say our economist is on the pessimistic side,'' one Comptroller aide said. But he noted that with the worsening national economic picture and ''no good news in any economic sector,'' it might turn out to be right.
Under Ms. Holtzman's forecast, the city will face up to a $738 million budget gap in the 1991 fiscal year, which began last July, and up to $2.6 billion the following year.
Her report predicts reductions in income and sales taxes, increases of more than $200 million each year in overtime costs and unanticipated labor costs of $83 million this year, and $534 million next.
But the administration tentatively concluded it had a gap of just about $290 million - $150 million in reduced revenue and $140 in increased expenses, Mr. Michael said.
Next year's gap was put at about $1.4 billion, including the previously announced gap of $970 million, $300 or so in reduced revenue and the rest in increased expenses. He said the administration predicted $35 million in unbudgeted overtime costs this year and no such overtime costs next year.

HEADLINE: About New York;
Soviet Economy Saved by Dentist! (Hey, He Tries)

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
The worst of this city's slums and the stagnating Soviet Union have a lot in common. At least that is the view of an uncommon New Yorker dedicated to reviving both.
Dr. Jeffrey A. Sachs today leaves to confer with apparatchiks of the Soviet Union, the Russian republic and the city of Moscow on ways to finance Moscow's first AIDS hospital. His goal is to bring municipal bonds to a pay-as-you-go country, enabling it to spread costs over many years. 
Dr. Sachs epitomizes the improbable. He is a lucky, plucky intellectual gunslinger who has gone far in many directions by a logic only he comprehends.
Now 38 years old, he came to know the Russians by knocking on the Kremlin door to promote a heavy metal rock concert. He is a dentist who never filled a tooth. He served in the highest levels of New York State government. With Andrew M. Cuomo, he founded HELP, the much praised public-private housing initiative. He has become a high-priced business consultant. He coaches a Little League team in Brooklyn's tattered East New York.
And he shares a common experience with many of the dozen or so people participating in his Soviet mission: They helped extricate New York from its last fiscal crisis. The problem is much the same: unless exceedingly clever solutions are found, bonds denominated in rubles are more repellent than New York bonds in 1975.
This is Dr. Sachs' ninth trip to Moscow in a little more than a year, all at his own expense - $75,000 so far. He insists he isn't doing it for money, but admits it might build contacts. His proclaimed goal is to help others, particularly America's needy.
He reasons that neither superpower has enough to spend on social programs because each spends too much on war. ''If we can stabilize them and make them successful, there's going to be more money for things here,'' Dr. Sachs said.
So his group is meeting with Russians to devise ways to finance a grain storage center, several stock exchanges and perhaps a condominium complex. The tendentious meetings sometimes seem a flashback to the fiscal crisis.
''It's the same meeting over and over again - there's always someone loud and obnoxious'' he said. ''It's just a matter of scale.''
Dr. Sachs was personally involved in the earlier money mess as senior health adviser to Gov. Hugh L. Carey. At the age of 28, a dozen agencies with 75,000 employees reported through him.
Dentistry never stood a chance, compared to the attraction of policy and politics. Even at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, where he studied things toothy, his first love was student government and his best friend the university president. After several Washington jobs, he went on to serve as the Governor's personal representative at Love Canal, and to preside over the emptying of the state's nefarious homes for the retarded. His dream is to sit in a President's Cabinet.
The other day, Dr. Sachs relaxed on a bench in the sun-filled courtyard of HELP's homeless residence in East New York. Children chased each other madly, dashed about on tricycles and scurried over colorful playground equipment. Mothers scrambled to keep up.
Dr. Sachs' comments reflected deep personal involvement. He told about a family with whom he became friendly here before they graduated to their own apartment in Harlem. The ceiling promptly fell on the woman and she was beaten by her boyfriend. Then her son stole money from drug dealers.
''My older son is dead,'' she told Dr. Sachs when he visited. ''They're going to kill him.''
Dr. Sachs felt she was probably right, and for once was inarticulate. Words are his playthings. He talked about economists being as initially imposing but ultimately as ephemeral as the Wizard of Oz; of possibly repaying ruble bonds in dollars, of chaos theory, of personally briefing K.G.B. officials.
He said his experience with HELP is relevant to the Soviet Union. It works because homeless people see residents leaving transitional housing for permanent. The Soviets, by contrast, are turning their world upside down on blind faith.
He said that they may be as disappointed by the ballyhooed free market as many people in the South Bronx. Small projects, combining private and public financing, are his prescription. ''There's no such thing as big,'' he said.
Indeed, one of his pet projects is of decidedly human scale. Dr. Sachs, always a bachelor, thinks it might be nice to get married.
''You pay a price for this kind of stuff,'' he said. ''I spent so much time with the social problems of the world that I probably didn't spend enough with the social problems of Jeffrey.''

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET BATTLE;
Democratic Plan to Tax Wealthy Has Democratic Hurdle in Senate

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 13

 BODY:
Despite broad support among Democratic lawmakers for a House deficit plan that would raise taxes for the wealthy, Democratic Senate leaders are committed to blocking it when it reaches the Senate.
Lawmakers say Senators George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, and Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, chairman of the Finance Committee, were forced to make such a commitment, against their personal and partisan preferences, because it was the only way to enlist the Republican votes that were needed to get a budget bill out of the Senate Finance Committee.
Early this morning the committee approved a bipartisan budget plan that would more than double the Federal gasoline tax, cut Medicare benefits deeply and not touch the tax rate paid by the wealthy. Two Democratic committee members, Bill Bradley of New Jersey and Max Baucus of Montana, refused to back the budget bill supported by Mr. Bentsen.
The latest developments set up a showdown next week in the yearlong struggle over the biggest deficit-reduction measure ever. The outcome could have enormous consequences for the economy and the Congressional elections on Nov. 6 and will affect the taxes or benefits of every American. 
On one side will be the House of Representatives, whose Democratic majority will be solidly behind the plan to make the wealthy bear most of the cost of deficit reduction. On the other will be President Bush, who favors the Senate Finance Committee plan. In the middle are Democratic senators, who are deeply divided over which way to turn.
 
Two Plans Differ Greatly
The positions taken by Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Bentsen will probably be one aspect of the showdown. Senate procedures make it almost impossible to pass legislation that the leaders oppose. That does not mean such a measure would not be approved by a Senate-House conference committee. But a bill like the one favored by rank-and-file Democrats that would tax the rich more heavily would almost certainly be vetoed by President Bush.
The Senate Finance Committee bill is in sharp contrast to a plan offered last week by Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. His proposal has galvanized Democrats like no other legislation in years.
The Rostenkowski plan, expected to coast through the House next week by a wide margin, would raise the income tax rates for people earning more than $200,000 a year by an average of nearly $11,000, would leave the gasoline tax at 9 cents a gallon, and would raise Medicare premiums and deductibles only slightly.
House Democrats across the board - conservatives from the rural South and liberals from the inner cities, those from white-collar suburbs and those from factory towns - rallied around the proposal. And by the weekend, the plan was gaining strength among Senate Democrats, who were just learning the details.
''I can't understand how any Democrat can vote against it,'' said Senator Jim Sasser of Tennessee, chairman of the Budget Committee.
From the Democrats' perspective, it turns a difficult budget debate next week into an easily understood question: Should deficit reduction require much higher gasoline taxes and much lower Medicare benefits, or should it force the very wealthy to pay higher income taxes?
It is not hard to divine where voters stand. A New York Times/CBS News Poll this week found that 86 percent of adults were willing to raise the taxes of people making more than $100,000 to reduce the budget deficit. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus three percentage points. A Times/CBS Poll in August found that a sizable majority of Americans believed that the rich had benefited most from Government policies of the last decade and that they had done so at the expense of everyone else.
 
G.O.P. on the Defensive
Republicans argue that a budget forcing the very wealthy to pay higher taxes would be disastrous for an economy on the cusp of a recession, inhibiting investment and restricting growth. But this week's developments put them on the defensive. When Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, was asked about the Rostenkowski plan on Friday, he said it was ''just another tax-and-spend effort to raise taxes by every way imaginable.''
When a reporter observed that Mr. Rostenkowski would not raise more taxes than the Bush Administration wants but merely raise them mainly from the rich rather than from all segments of society, Mr. Fitzwater simply repeated the mantra. ''It's the same Democratic approach we've seen for years and years of trying to increase spending and increase taxes to cover it,'' he said.
Representative Raymond J. McGrath, a Republican from Nassau County, is one of many Republican lawmakers who is uncomfortable about the votes next week. ''It is a genius of a political plan,'' Mr. McGrath said. ''I told my guys, 'You're going to have a hard time voting against it.' ''
For days this week, Mr. Bentsen tried to put together a tax and spending package favorable to most Democrats. #2 Key Democrats Oppose Plan But there are only 11 Democrats on the 20-member Finance Committee, and two of them, Senators Bradley and Baucus, made it clear that they would oppose a plan that would tax the rich more heavily than others.
Senator Bradley was a principal author of the monumental Tax Reform Act of 1986, which lowered tax rates and abolished most deductions and other tax breaks, and he does not want to see the principles of that law changed. Senator Baucus, who is up for re-election next month, has said his career would be in jeopardy if he voted for any measure that raised taxes.
That meant that the entire budget package would have died in the committee unless some Republicans voted for it, and the Republicans made the commitments by Senator Mitchell and Senator Bentsen the price of their support.
Bob Dole of Kansas, the Senate minority leader, and Bob Packwood of Oregon, the senior Republican on the Finance Committee, made a similar pledge to oppose any changes in the bill. But that was an easy promise for them to make, since they basically favor the package.
But for Senator Mitchell, who has been the most outspoken Democrat in the Senate about the need for higher taxes on the wealthy, it was an agonizing decision.
In an interview broadcast today on the Cable News Network program ''Newsmaker Saturday,'' Mr. Mitchell said: ''I favor an increase in rates. The top rate should be 33 percent or 35 percent. But the President is opposed, and we can't pass it without his signature.''
He was not asked about the deal he made to get Republican votes, and he was not available for a separate interview.
 
Choices Trouble Bentsen
Senator Bentsen was also said to be anguished. ''I've seen him look wistfully at the paper on the Rostenkowski plan several times in the last few days,'' a spokesman said today, ''but he didn't have the votes to get it out of committee.''
The measure approved by the Finance Committee today is the core of an overall budget that is supposed to reduce the deficit by $40 billion this year and $500 billion over five years. It would neither raise tax rates nor change the capital gains tax rate. These are among the main elements of the panel's budget bill:
* An increase in the gasoline tax from the current 9 cents a gallon to 18.5 cents by 1992.
* An increase of more than $20 a month by 1996 in the premium paid by the elderly, currently $28.60, for insurance covering doctors' bills under Medicare and a doubling of the annual deductible to $150.
* An increase to $89,000 from $53,000 in the amount of wages subject to the 1.45 percent payroll tax for Medicare.
* A 10 percent luxury tax on cars costing more than $30,000, boats costing more than $100,000, private planes costing more than $250,000 and furs and jewelry costing more than $5,000.
* Tax breaks totaling $3.5 billion over five years to encourage oil and gas production. They would not become effective unless the price of oil, now more than $40 a barrel, falls below $34.
* A limit on itemized deductions under which taxpayers would have their deductions reduced by 5 percent of the amount of their annual income over $100,000.
The House is most likely to pass the Rostenkowski plan on Tuesday or Wednesday. The Senate will then take up the bill approved by the Finance Committee and is expected to pass it after rejecting an amendment including the main parts of the Rostenkowski plan.
The two bills will then go to a conference committee, and representatives of the White House will surely take part. The conference will be much like the budget negotiations last month in which the sides were at loggerheads.
The issue for the Democrats will be how far they can push the President toward higher taxes on the rich. The issue for the President will be how to hold on to what he wants and still get a measure that can be adopted by the Senate and the House.

HEADLINE: A Little Lonelier Than in 70's, New York Faces Fiscal Crisis

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEVINE

 BODY:
Fifteen years after its costly and humiliating brush with bankruptcy, New York City is edging into fiscal straits that seem painfully familiar.
For all the talk of budget gaps, spending cuts, tax increases and layoffs, the city's financial monitors and independent economists say its current fiscal problems are not so severe as those of the mid-1970's when the city, banished from the credit markets, could no longer sell notes and bonds.
But as Mayor David N. Dinkins struggles to stabilize the budget and at the same time combat rising crime and a host of other social ills, he seems likely to find himself more on his own than Mayor Abraham D. Beame was a decade and a half ago.
 
Past Benefactors' Problems
New York State and a reluctant Federal Government, the city's main benefactors then, cannot be counted on to help now, since both have their own fiscal problems. Potentially more worrisome, perhaps, New York City must also contend with weakening local and national economies that may prove a major hindrance to a recovery. 
Late last week, the Dinkins administration said it would cut $2.3 billion from the city's nearly $16 billion capital budget, but the savings in operating funds will average only about $100 million a year over the next 10 years. Mr. Dinkins has also imposed a partial hiring freeze and a moratorium on most raises and is considering laying off 15,000 municipal workers.
But given the size of the budget gaps, the tentative 5.5 percent raise that his administration recently negotiated with the teachers and his plan to hire thousands of additional police officers at a cost of nearly $2 billion over four years, the Mayor has been criticized for failing to put forth a comprehensive plan to resolve the budget problems.
The fiscal crisis of the 1970's was a result both of an economic slide with no precedent in New York City history and of the city's response, which was to borrow more and more money to cover its day-to-day expenses.
But in the summer of 1975, New York's credit was cut off, and it was threatened by a nearly $2 billion deficit and, far worse, a cumulative short-term debt of more than $5 billion, which the city is still paying off.
The crisis was resolved with help from Albany and Washington, the creation of agencies to monitor the city's finances and borrow money on its behalf and the paring of the municipal payroll.
 
'Long, Hard Pull'
Because the crisis occurred just before the start of the most powerful local economic boom since World War II, the city's recovery was also propelled by a largely unexpected surge of tax revenues when it most needed them.
This time, New York's fiscal distress comes early in a downturn that could persist for years. And even when the economy picks up, New York is not expected to return to the soaring growth rates of the 1980's anytime soon.
''It's going to be a long, hard pull,'' said Raymond D. Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a watchdog group financed by businesses.
For three of the last five years, municipal spending has outstripped revenues, causing New York City to dip into savings. Future budget deficits are now estimated at from $1 billion to $2 billion a year or even more.
Then again, today's budgets are almost three times the size of the budgets in the mid-70's. And this time, New York does not have to cope with repaying a huge short-term debt and still has access to the credit markets, though it has been put under a ''credit watch'' by Standard & Poor's Corporation, the bond-rating agency.
New York City now confronts a challenge that seems more managerial than the financial challenge of the 1970's: How can it maintain or even augment services for a population that in some ways has become increasingly dependent on them in an era of slowly growing revenues and uncertain aid?
''The last time, it was a credit problem and a liquidity problem,'' said Harrison J. Goldin, City Comptroller from 1974 to 1989. ''This time, it's a budgetary problem and a social problem.''
 
Series of Rules and Procedures
Even so, a legacy of the 1975 crisis was the adoption of rules and procedures intended to insure that it would not be repeated, and experts say they have worked.
Three state agencies - the Municipal Assistance Corporation, the Financial Control Board and the Office of the State Deputy Comptroller for the City of New York - keep watch over the city.
Fifteen years ago, the city did not know how many employees it had or how much money it owed or was owed.
Mr. Goldin recalled finding billions of dollars worth of negotiable bonds that were deposits from contractors shoved into shoeboxes in a closet at a city office.
New York City's accounting procedures are now so rigorous that its books are regarded as models for other localities. The city also must update its budget quarterly and issue financial plans that cover four years, making it harder for officials to hide from the fiscal implications of a souring economy.
''The thing about 1975 was the avoidance of the economic problems and the assumption that they would go away,'' said Dick Netzer, a professor of economics at the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service at New York University. ''This is clearly not happening today.''
There were historic reasons for that complacency. As Professor Netzer notes in a new book, ''Urban Politics, New York Style,'' published by M. E. Sharpe Inc., the city's economy had matched or outperformed the nation's for more than a half-century.
But by 1969 New York had begun a long, cruel swoon that left it with about 600,000 fewer jobs by 1977.
During this time, though, the prevailing view of the experts was that the city would soon bounce back, as it always had. Rather than cut spending, the city increased it, and it paid its workers higher wages. As revenues sagged, it borrowed money and simply rolled over the notes when they came due. The debt snowballed.
 
Jobs and Inflation
A severe national recession and tighter credit brought a sudden end to this practice in 1975, leaving the city with a huge debt and no way to repay it or, for that matter, meet its payroll. To resolve the crisis, New York State created the Municipal Assistance Corporation, an agency to borrow money for the city. The Federal Government provided and guaranteed city loans. The state assumed costs for higher education and the courts; the city work force was slashed.
But two events outside the control of the city's fiscal saviors and savants also contributed: a surge in new jobs that began in 1977, and a spurt of double-digit inflation that, with labor costs under control, augmented the stream of unexpected revenue.
New York City's economy, badly shaken by the stock market's collapse three years ago and the subsequent contraction in Wall Street employment, is now moving in the opposite direction. In the first half of 1990 the city lost 8,000 jobs in private industry. Retail sales are down. The rise in oil prices and anticipated tax increases by all levels of government will cut spending power, and the weakening national economy will compound the local problems.
Still, economists do not believe that the 1990's will be so painful as the 70's. While the city has nearly 200,000 fewer jobs than it did in 1969, it has shifted to a service-based economy with more higher-paying positions.
 
Hope and a Warning
''New York has strength in the industries and sectors that are in the forefront of national and international economic growth,'' said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.
But in many ways the New York City of 1990 is worse off than it was in 1975.
In a report last week, Rosemary Scanlon, chief economist of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said the city's economic downturn might be reversed by mid-1991, a prediction more optimistic than other economists'. Even so, Ms. Scanlon noted in an interview that the city's dismal mood could be self-destructive.
''If gloom becomes very pervasive, it will become reinforcing,'' she said. ''That is the part that reminds me more about 1975 than the numbers.''

HEADLINE: Economy and Mideast Standoff Bring a Drop in Bush's Standing

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES

 BODY:
Support for President Bush's commitment of American troops in the Persian Gulf has begun to erode in recent days as Americans grow frustrated with the standoff in the desert and increasingly worried about the sagging economy at home, the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll has found.
The poll of 960 adults, conducted by telephone last week, found economic fears at their highest in a decade and Mr. Bush's overall job rating the worst of his Presidency, although it remains at a level that some recent Presidents would have coveted.
There was a dramatic defection from Mr. Bush among the nation's older citizens, those 65 years old and over, whose general economic fears have been deepened by talk from Washington of increases in taxes and Medicare premiums.
Over all, 60 percent of those surveyed said they approved of the way Mr. Bush is handling his job, down from 76 percent in a New York Times/ CBS News Poll soon after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August. Thirty percent expressed overall disapproval, up from 15 percent in August and the highest level of disapproval toward Mr. Bush so far in his Presidency. 
 
A Strong Undercurrent
Support for his handling of the Kuwait situation declined to 57 percent from the 75 percent who expressed approval soon after the invasion.
From the beginning of the gulf confrontation, analysts of public opinion noted a strong undercurrent among Americans against commitment of military power. But until now, this did not seem to undermine the overwhelming support for Mr. Bush's specific actions as Americans rallied around the President.
But in the last three weeks there has been a significant shift. In late September, 75 percent of the public told a survey conducted for Americans Talk Security, a bipartisan research group, that the United States had done the right thing by sending troops to the gulf. In the latest Times/CBS News survey, 61 percent said the United States had done the right thing. Those who said the United States should have stayed out rose to 32 percent from 20 percent.
Figures in the latest Times/CBS News survey should generally be accurate, according to statistical theory, to within three percentage points, plus or minus, of what would have been found if all adults in the country had been sought out for a survey. The margin of sampling error of the Americans Talk Security survey was also plus or minus three percentage points.
Foreign policy and the performance of the economy are generally the two key measures by which Americans judge their Presidents. Seven out of 10 Americans think the economy is getting worse, the largest number to hold such a negative view since April 1980, seven months before President Jimmy Carter lost his bid for re-election.
In the latest poll, 52 percent expressed disapproval of Mr. Bush's handling of the economy and 58 percent disapproved of his handling of the budget deficit. Analysts in both parties suggested that rising economic fears are dragging down overall support for Mr. Bush, as well as support for his most important foriegn policy commitment.
''If people start disapproving on one thing they will tend to generalize that opinion to other things,'' said Fred Steeper, a partner in Market Strategies, a Republican polling concern.
 
Budget Was Dominating News
The Times/CBS News survey was conducted Monday through Wednesday during a period when the Persian Gulf, for the first time since the Iraqi invasion, was not dominanting the news and Mr. Bush's policy in the gulf was facing little direct criticism. What was dominating the news was the great confusion and conflicting statements from Mr. Bush about exactly where he stood on taxes and the proposals Congress was wrestling with to lower the deficit.
By a majority of 54 percent to 37 percent, Americans said Mr. Bush should have shown stronger leadership in trying to settle the budget crisis.
''Obviously, the budget situation, and the news surrounding it, has not inured to the President's benefit,'' said Charles Black, who is a senior political adviser to the White House as well as chief spokesman for the Republican National Committee. ''Nevertheless, that's still a pretty high job approval rating, not far from levels he's enjoyed in the last two years, except during the first few weeks of the Persian Gulf, when he got up to levels no one could sustain for long.''
The cost of the nation's committment in the gulf was cited by several respondents who said they had shifted from approval to disapproval. ''I didn't know it was going to cost a million dollars a day,'' Jesse White, an assembly line worker for B. F. Goodrich in Tuscaloosa, Ala., said in a follow-up interview after the poll.
Those who disapprove of Mr. Bush's handling of the invasion of Kuwait split evenly between those who said they believe the United States should take stronger military action at this time and those who did not.
''If they're going to do something, I think they should get it done,'' said Tillie Daniels, 61, a Democrat from Willow Springs, Mo. ''I don't think they should prolong it and let it go on and on and on.''
Americans are becoming more pessimistic and more cynical, or realistic, about the gulf confrontation. The percent who say they believe the crisis will be resolved without fighting has fallen to 47 percent from 53 percent since August and those who believe the United States is there mainly to protect oil supplies has increased to 55 percent from 44 percent since September.
 
Most Support Commitment
While many recent reports from the gulf have emphasized the deaths of American military personnel in air crashes, 6 out of 10 surveyed said the American troop commitment is worth the cost, roughly the same proportion as supported sending them. While support for sending troops has declined, the public position on a naval blockade, a safer form of military engagement in the minds of many people, remains unchanged from a September survey by CBS News, with 6 in 10 supporting it and 3 in 10 opposed.
With 23 days until Election Day, the survey captured a considerable mood for change among Americans. A plurality favor turning the Republicans out of the White House and the Democrats out of Congress.
Mr. Bush began his Presidency with approval of about 60 percent of the public, and with most of the rest waiting to make up their minds rather than expressing disapproval.
Over the course of the next year Mr. Bush won most of the undecideds to his side. But now he is losing many of them. Approval of the job he is doing declined among every major group, from men and Democrats to Republicans and those making more than $50,000 a year. But in no case were the declines as great as among those most economically vulnerable, including those making under $15,000 annualy and, most dramaticly of all, those Americans 65 and older.
Those 65 and over, an age group which votes more heavily than any other, are now evenly divided between the 41 percent who express approval of Mr. Bush's handling of his job and the 41 percent who express disapproval. That is a sharp shift from the 70 percent of older Americans who expressed approval and the 17 percent who expressed disapproval in August.
 
'More and More Disgusted'
This dramatic shift means that 1 out of every 4 americans 65 or over, the only group of Americans with personal memories of the Depression, shifted from approval to disapproval of Mr. Bush's handling of the Presidency.
''I'm getting more and more disgusted with him,'' said Lois Kemp, 65, a lifelong Republican from Thousand Palms, Calif., said in a follow-up interview to the survey. ''I didn't think Dukakis would do a thing and I'm still glad I voted for Bush. But I'm disgusted with the budget and Medicare. He's letting his buddies off scot-free, and we poor people on Medicare are going to have to pay.''
Mr. Bush's support eroded among other age groups as well, but not nearly so dramatically. The youngest adults remain the most supportive of the President. Approval among those 18 to 29 slipped to 70 percent from 79 percent in August.
This was another example of the growing sense in American politics of a generational scism between young and old. Indeed, one young respondent to the survey, Vinny M. Boland, 31, a sign maker from Miramar, Fla., cited elder citizens as one of the ''big interests'' that he said dominate Congress.
Mr. Bush's approval remains strong by the standards of recent Presidents. Gerald Ford and Mr. Carter both fell below 60 percent approval not long after taking office - Mr. Ford within weeks and Mr. Carter within months -and never recovered.
At this point in his Presidency, Ronald Reagan had approval ratings in the low to mid-40's as the nation struggled through a recession. Mr. Black, the Republican spokesman, suggested that a budget deal would help reverse the current decline in the economy and thus shore up Mr. Bush's political weaknesses by 1992.
But others suggested that Mr. Bush lacked Mr. Reagan's resilency and core of support. ''I just loved Ronald Reagan,'' said Mabel Holton, 62, a Democrat from Philadelphia. ''Maybe it's because he was so handsome and was in the movies. It's a personality thing. Anyone who looks at Bush on television knows there's nothing warm about the man, nothing to instill confidence.''
More substantively, said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster, Mr. Bush will have a harder time blaming the economic downturn on Democrats the way Mr. Reagan was able to blame the recession and inflation of the early 1980's on Mr. Carter.
 
HOW THE POLL WAS CONDUCTED
The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Oct. 8-10 with 960 adults around the United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the country. The exchanges were chosen so as to insure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. The numbers were then screened so that only residences would be called.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of residential telephone lines and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to region, race, sex, age and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
The percentages reported are the particular results most likely to match what would be obtained by seeking out all adult Americans. Other possible percentages are progressively less likely the more they differ from the reported results.
The potential sampling error for smaller subgroups is larger. For example, for people 65 years of age or older it is plus or minus eight percentage points.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll.

HEADLINE: Church Leaders Declare A 'Holy War' on Drugs

BYLINE: By MARVINE HOWE

 BODY:
Churches have been havens in New York's poorer neighborhoods from the drug war raging on its ever-more violent streets. This weekend, 200 pastors and lay members of the United Methodist Church spent the weekend discussing how they can do even more.
National church leaders brought plans for a ''holy war'' against drugs modeled on programs developed by congregations shocked by the soaring violence in Washington. When a turf shoot-out left two young men seeking safety dead on the steps of a congregation that had locked its doors during service, church members there decided that they needed to go out to the streets to combat the causes of the drug plague. 
''We must mount a holy war against drugs and reclaim our streets,'' said Bishop Felton E. May of Harrisonburg, Pa., who is on a special assignment to develop the church's response to the drug crisis on a national level.
While some at the meeting, at St. Mark's United Methodist Church on Edgecombe Avenue in Harlem, wondered how well their churches could meet such a challenge, all seemed to agree that it had to be attempted, and that their churches should take the lead.
 
Drafting Strategies
''People are really worried because it's dangerous out there,'' said the Rev. John Collins, pastor of the Tremont United Methodist Church in the South Bronx. He said that the churches from the eight districts represented at the conference have been asked to draft their own strategies, which will be presented at a meeting in January.
It is time the church gets in the forefront of the war on drugs, said the Rev. Lee Quinlan, pastor of the First United Methodist Church of Hollis, Queens. She said that addicts were shooting drugs across from her church last Sunday and that the churches in the neighborhood plan to take the anti-drug message to the streets.
''In Westchester County, all parents are afraid their children are either involved in drugs or will get involved,'' the Rev. Gail Paul, pastor of the Purdys United Methodist Church, said. She said she would use some of the ideas from the conference in her counseling work with prisoners in three correctional institutions in the area.
Vanna Griffin, the wife of the pastor of the Naugatuck United Methodist Church, near Waterbury, Conn., said that even in a small town, the drug problem was very serious. ''You don't always see it in the fine middle class that pays taxes and mows lawns, but they're all touched by it.''
Bishop May's emphasis is on drug education and treatment and the need ''to strike at the root causes of the drug problem,'' namely: spiritual malaise, racism and economic injustice.
The Saving Stations program is focused on community outreach, which includes drug education, youth rehabilitation, health programs, safe houses for abused women and children, housing, food and clothing for addicts and their families, and evangelism.
''It's a 24-hour-a-day commitment by our churches,'' said the Rev. Bernard Keels, pastor of the A. P. Shaw Church in Washington, who talked about Saving Stations to the assembly and in workshops. It was at Shaw Church, located in the southeast part of the capital, known as ''the killing zone'' that the idea of Saving Stations was born, under a retired pastor, the Rev. Everett Stephenson.
Pooling resources to confront the drug crisis, the Shaw church and 13 other churches in the Washington area have signed a covenant making the drug crisis the top priority on each church's agenda. Shaw and several covenant churches have also set up ''tent ministries'' to offer drug counseling and medical referrals to people afraid to come inside churches.
''We need to put our energies more into people than institutions,'' said the Rev. Ruthenia H. Finley, pastor of St. Mark's United Methodist Church. She approved of the community involvement in the Washington program but said: ''I don't know if we have the stick-to-itiveness power in New York, I don't know if we could sustain 24-hour-a-day commitment.''

The Dinkins administration has a firm grip on New York City's fiscal and labor problems, despite the impression of ''some confusion,'' an aide to the Mayor told municipal union officers yesterday.
''I can assure you the administration is very much on top of the situation,'' said Frank T. New, the director of legislative affairs for Mayor David N. Dinkins. 
Mr. New acknowledged that a series of seemingly contradictory events a week ago ''created some confusion among all of us.'' On Oct. 1, the Mayor announced a 5.5 percent raise for teachers, and the next day he proposed hiring thousands more police officers. But by the end of the week, the city was projecting new budget gaps, imposing a hiring freeze and considering laying off 15,000 workers.
Mr. New spoke yesterday to a meeting of officers of Local 375 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, representing about 7,000 technical workers, including engineers, chemists and planners.
''Obviously the city is facing a financial crisis,'' Mr. New said. But he said layoffs would be imposed only as ''a last resort'' and were ''by no means certain at this point.''
Louis G. Albano, president of the union local, expressed skepticism about the extent of the city's financial problems. ''Our economists agree with the city's economists that the situation is tight, but they do not agree it is a bad as the city says,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A Savings and Loan Bailout, and Bush's Son Jeb

BYLINE: By JEFF GERTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 13

 BODY:
After Jeb Bush, a son of the President, and a partner bought a Miami office building using money an associate had borrowed from a local savings and loan, the Federal Government wound up repaying most of the loan.
The savings institution became insolvent, and the Government paid more than $4 million to make good the loan as part of the bailout of the savings industry. Mr. Bush and his partner negotiated a settlement with regulators in which they repaid $505,000 and retained control of the building. While they still have a $7 million mortgage to pay on that property, the settlement with the Government lifted from their backs a $4.565 million second mortgage.
There is no evidence that Mr. Bush or his partner improperly influenced the settlement process. Mr. Bush, in an interview, said he was a ''victim of circumstance'' and had no involvement in the settlement talks.
Mr. Bush invited a reporter to come to Miami to review the partnership's records. ''We have nothing to fear or hide about the transaction,'' he said. 
 
Making Good on Bad Loans
While the complex loan arrangement does not involve allegations of criminal behavior, it stands as an illustration of the poor lending practices of savings institutions that led the industry into desperate straits. The deal also illustrates how the Government has had to absorb a large portion of the thousands of bad loans that were made by savings institutions that failed in 1988. The rescue of these institutions will cost $70 billion.
The Government's repayment of the loan used by Mr. Bush and his partner was part of the bailout program approved by Congress, in which the Government guaranteed buyers of ailing institutions that it would make good on bad loans that had been made by those institutions. Had the Government not made such guarantees, it would have had trouble finding buyers for the institutions and would have had to pay off the depositors.
The loan was made by Broward Federal Savings and Loan in Sunrise, Fla., which became insolvent in 1988 because of what regulators said were poor lending practices on commercial loans in the mid-1980's. The cost of cleaning up Broward Federal has been estimated at $285 million.
 
Arrangement Is Defended
Federal officials defended the Government's previously undisclosed agreement with Mr. Bush and his associates, saying it was the best settlement available because of the weakened commercial real estate market in Miami and because the loan was secured by a risky second mortgage. They said no preferential treatment had been accorded the President's 37-year-old son and his partner.
When the office building was reappraised to reflect the decline in commercial real estate in the Miami area, Federal regulators concluded that it made sense to let the owners keep the building because its value was less than its first mortgage.
Evaluating the settlement is difficult, because crucial papers, including property appraisals, are not public documents. And a lawsuit about the complex loan arrangement, which might have resolved or at least provided a public discussion of various critical issues, was settled out of court.
 
History of a Deal
Debt Plan Causes Misunderstanding
 In a series of interviews in their Miami office, Mr. Bush and his partner, Armando Codina, said the lengthy legal and regulatory process had cost them money, including Federal income taxes they are paying on the forgiven debt.
The two men attributed their problems to the failure of an associate, J. Edward Houston, to join them as an investor, as they had hoped. Instead Mr. Houston's company, the owner of another savings and loan, agreed to lend Mr. Bush and Mr. Codina the $4.565 million and borrowed the money from Broward Federal.
''The intention was to be an equity investment; instead he took a second mortgage and then at the last moment he borrowed the money from another institution,'' Mr. Bush said.
Jeb Bush's dealings in Miami are not related to those of his brother Neil, who was a director of the Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association in Denver. Neil Bush, who is 35, defended himself last month in Denver on civil charges by the Government that he acted improperly in his role as a director of Silverado, which failed in 1988 after making questionable loans, including some to Neil Bush's business associates.
 
An Active Republican
Jeb Bush has been prominent in Florida Republican politics and is state chairman of the re-election campaign of Gov. Bob Martinez. But his involvement in the complicated loan arrangement has gone unnoticed.
Mr. Bush's name is mentioned in the three volumes of records of a 1987 lawsuit filed by Broward Federal against the recipients of the loan proceeds, including a partnership owned by Mr. Bush and Mr. Codina.
According to the lawsuit, the loan transaction goes back to 1983, when Mr. Codina, a developer, obtained an option to buy a building at 1390 Brickell Avenue, the center of Miami's downtown financial district. Mr. Codina later assigned the option to a partnership, 1390 Brickell, of which he owned 80 percent and Mr. Bush the rest.
Mr. Bush is involved in the real estate business with Mr. Codina through a series of partnerships and corporations, under the umbrella of the Codina Bush Group. The Brickell Avenue building is managed by one of Mr. Bush's real estate companies.
 
Link to Savings Institution
Also in 1983, the J. E. Houston Financial Group, a company headed by Mr. Houston, a former Fort Lauderdale banker, acquired a small savings and loan, South Florida Savings. Mr. Houston became the president of the institution, rapidly expanded it and eventually moved its headquarters to a floor of plush offices at the five-story building at 1390 Brickell Avenue.
Mr. Bush, Mr. Codina and Mr. Houston's company were originally going to acquire the building together, the Bush-Codina partnership argued in court. Mr. Codina said all the parties expected to build a much bigger building on the land.
But one lawyer involved in the transaction said the planned investment by the Houston group had never been approved by Federal regulators, who would have had to approve any real estate transactions involving an insured savings and loan and an affiliated entity, like the Houston company.
 
Acquiring an Option
Instead of making the cash investment, Mr. Houston's company lent the Bush-Codina partnership $4.565 million and obtained a second mortgage on the building and an option to acquire half the partnership. Mr. Houston took that second mortgage, but not the option, and assigned it to Broward Federal as collateral for its loan. By retaining the option, Mr. Houston's company had the right to be consulted before the building could be disposed of.
''We didn't intend to get involved with a savings and loan,'' Mr. Bush said.
Mr. Houston never exercised his option to buy half the partnership and has a different view of the transaction, seeing it as a deal that turned sour for all parties. In an interview, he said, ''It was not my understanding that I was to convert into equity.'' He added, ''Both sides were unsatisfied, which is a sign of an arm's-length deal.''
 
The Money Flow
$11.5 Million Debt On $9 Million Sale
 The deal closed on Feb. 1, 1985, and the proceeds of the Broward Federal loan passed through Mr. Houston's company to the partnership, records show. That same day the 1390 Brickell partnership purchased the office building for $9 million, according to public records.
As part of the acquisition, the partnership secured a first mortgage of $7 million from an insurance company. That and the $4.565 million loan provided $11.565 million. In addition to the $9 million sale price, the money was used for improvements costing $1.7 million and the establishment of reserve accounts of $1.16 million, Mr. Codina said.
 
His Role in Partnership
IntrAmerica Investments, a company controlled by Mr. Codina, is the general partner of the 1390 Brickell partnership. Court records show that Mr. Bush signed various documents in 1985 and 1986 as president of IntrAmerica. Mr. Bush said he had been active in getting the building leased but had not been involved in the subsequent litigation or settlement negotiations.
Broward Federal began the litigation in 1987, two days after regulators placed South Florida Savings, Mr. Houston's institution, into receivership. Contending that its loan to Mr. Houston's corporation was in default, Broward Federal sued the corporation and Mr. Houston, who had personally guaranteed the loan, and the Bush-Codina partnership, whose note Mr. Houston had pledged to Broward as collateral for its loan.
Seeking to protect the collateral it held on the defaulted loan, Broward Federal asked the court to declare it the owner of the partnership's second mortgage note. That note had been pledged to Broward along with the income from the building and a reserve account as collateral for the Houston note.
 
Disputing Who Should Pay
For two years, claims and counterclaims flew over who should pay back the $4.565 million. The 1390 Brickell partnership argued that Mr. Houston or his company should pay. Mr. Houston argued that Broward Federal, having attached the partnership's note, should seek repayment from the partnership.
The lawsuit was twice set for trial, but the case was settled out of court under the auspices of Federal regulators, who were authorized to step in because of a Dec. 31, 1988, agreement under which Broward Federal's assets and liabilities were sold, under Government supervision, to California Federal Bank, a Los Angeles savings and loan.
 
The Negotiations
$7 Million Mortgage Derails One Accord
 The agreement, like most of the other 1988 savings and loan deals, called for the Government to guarantee any loss experienced by the California institution in taking over Broward's affairs. In addition, the Government was obligated to pay the acquiring institution's costs in managing the loans and any litigation to resolve them.
In a settlement agreement dated March 10, 1989, California Federal and the 1390 Brickell partnership agreed that the partnership would relinquish ownership of the building and that Mr. Codina would turn over his option on a nearby property. It also required the Bush-Codina partnership to pay at least $745,000, mostly the balance in an interest reserve account set up as part of the loan.
This settlement was rejected by the Government because it ''didn't make sense economically'' since whoever owned the building was liable for the $7 million first mortgage, said Dan Griffin, an official of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation who supervised the negotiations.
 
Revising an Appraisal
Mr. Griffin said the office building had originally been appraised at $9.5 million but that appraisals in the first half of 1989 reduced the appraised value to no more than $6.5 million. Thus, the regulators concluded that it would be better to let the owners keep the property rather than have the Government take over a $6.5 million building that carried $7 million in mortgage debt.
The new apprasials were ordered because regulators felt the first appraisal was outdated given the changes in Miami's real estate market. The F.D.I.C. declined to release the appraisals or the names of the companies that did them.
Mr. Griffin of the F.D.I.C. said the settlement delays ''had nothing to do with Jeb Bush'' but were ''because of the size of the write-off and the disparity of the appraisals.'' 10 Cents on the Dollar Charles A. Fulton, a senior lawyer at the F.D.I.C. who was involved in the negotiations, said a search by lawyers had concluded there was little legal or financial leverage to recover anything beyond 10 cents on the dollar, in part because the search found that Mr. Houston had few recoverable assets.
Mr. Griffin said the recovery rate of 10 cents on the dollar was about average for second mortgages like the one made by Broward Federal.
After the settlement was rejected by Federal regulators in June, the Codina-Bush partnership tried to settle its debt, starting with an offer of about $325,000. That was rejected, Mr. Fulton and Mr. Griffin said.
 
The Settlement
Leftover Money Is Used for Payment
 About the same time, the reserve account, then the focus of the negotiations and the ultimate source of most of what the Government recovered, was used by Mr. Bush and Mr. Codina to pay more than $200,000 in delinquent real estate taxes, Mr. Griffin and Mr. Codina said. That step was approved by California Federal Bank, but Federal regulators, who were supposed to oversee such transactions, did not learn about it until after it had taken place, Mr. Fulton said.
The final settlement of $505,000 paid by the Bush-Codina partnership consisted of the $437,000 remainining in the interest reserve accountand the balance in a small escrow account, $68,000, according to records and the F.D.I.C. officials.
The final agreement was put together in the summer and fall of 1989, drafted in December, and entered into the court file earlier this year. During this time, legal authority for approving the settlement shifted from the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to the F.D.I.C., as a result of President Bush's signing the savings and loan rescue legislation on Aug. 9, 1989.
 
The Issue of Taxpayers' Money
Both Mr. Bush and Mr. Codina expressed surprise that the settlement of the loan could be interpreted as the use of taxpayers' money to make good a loan whose proceeds went for their building. Asked if they were aware that the funds for the repayment of the Broward Federal loan came from the taxpayers, both men said no.
Mr. Bush and Mr. Codina said they had incurred additional costs as a result of the transaction, the largest being a $1.316 million tax liability this year when they declared the forgiven debt as income to the Internal Revenue Service.

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET BATTLE;
Accord Expected Soon on Farm Bill With $13 Billion in Savings

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 13

 BODY:
The House and Senate conference committee that is writing a new farm bill is close to agreeing to significant changes in the Government's commodity price support program that would save more than $13 billion over the next five years.
Committee staff members are working out the details of a broad accord reached Friday night by the conferees and expect to have the bill ready for a committee vote on Monday, a staff member said today.
The changes in commodity programs were necessary to meet the requirements of the Congressional budget resolution aimed at reducing the Federal deficit. The resolution called for the conferees to reduce farm program spending by more than 25 percent over the next five fiscal years. Without the changes, the committee had estimated that the price support program would cost the Government $54 billion to $56 billion from the fiscal years 1991 through 1995. 
Since the program was established in the early 1930's, the core of American farm policy has been a contract between farmers and the Government that sets production by controlling the amount of land under cultivation. $7.8 Bill in Price Supports In exchange for setting aside a specific number of acres to lay idle each year, typically 5 to 15 percent of their tillable land, farmers who sign up for the program gain a payment for every bushel of grain, bale of cotton or pound of rice they produce. Government payments to farmers in the program totaled $7.8 billion in the last fiscal year, having reached a record $25.8 billion in 1986.
On Friday, the House conferees proposed saving $5.8 billion by 1995 by sharply reducing the amount of land on which farmers could grow crops eligible for Government payments. The House also proposed saving $2.9 billion by changing the formula for calculating the level of Government payments. Instead of basing payments on a 5-month average of market prices, the House said farmers' payments should be based on a 12-month average.
 
A $1 Billion Sales Tax
These changes in rules would reduce Government payments to hundreds of thousands of individual grain, rice and cotton farmers by thousands of dollars each. In addition, the House proposal calls for producers of milk, sugar, tobacco, peanuts, honey and wool to pay the Government 1 percent of the sale price of their products at the time they are marketed, a plan intended to raise $1 billion a year.
Some members of the House delegation to the conference said their proposal could be a first step toward eliminating the Government's farm programs, an outcome sought by President Bush and other Presidents.
''At some point a farmer is going to ask whether it costs him more to be part of the farm programs than to be out of them,'' said Representative Glenn English, Democrat of Oklahoma, a member of the House delegation. ''If we get to the point where half or less than half of farmers participate, I think there is a question of whether the farm program becomes nothing more than simple welfare. It can't be justified on that ground.''
In recent years more than 90 percent of the producers of the 14 commodities receiving Government price supports participated in the program.
'From the Pockets of Farmers'
Leaders of farm groups said Friday that their members would be hurt by the proposal. ''They're taking money from the pockets of farmers,'' said Michael Dunn, a vice president for the National Farmers Union, which represents 250,000 farm families. ''It's unfair that farmers are being asked to bear so much of the burden of the Federal budget deficit.''
The House and Senate conferees took up the proposal to cut spending on the price support programs after failing to come to agreement on the last two environmental provisions of the new farm legislation. The first of the disputed provisions would bar the export of pesticides that are unlawful to use in the United States. The second would require farmers to keep detailed records of the pesticides they use and to make them available to medical specialists and farm workers.
Both provisions are strongly supported by Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, who is the chairman of the conference. But Republican Senate conferees and many House conferees of both parties oppose the measures. It remains uncertain whether these provisions will be in the final bill.
 
Deficit Forcing Hard Decisions
It is clear from the proposals to cut spending on the price support program that the budget deficit is doing more to force change than years of political fighting on Capitol Hill. The House conferees say their proposal for sharply reducing the acreage eligible for the program gives farmers more flexibility to choose their crops, something Democrats and Republicans, scientists and economists, Presidents and Agriculture secretaries have been talking about since the 1970's.
The House proposal could eliminate 30 to 45 percent of a farmer's land from eligibility in the price support program by 1995. According to the proposal, a farmer in the program could use about 60 percent of his tillable land to grow crops that would receive Government price supports. Fifteen percent of his land would be idle and he could grow what he wanted on the rest, but the only money he would receive from the crops on this land would come from their sale. This year a bushel of wheat sold for more than $1 less than the price paid by the Government.

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET BATTLE: Washington Talk;
House Republicans Try, As Always, to Matter

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 13

 BODY:
The House Republicans' defection from the White House put them at the center of budget politics last week. This week, they were back on familiar turf: shoved to the sidelines, spurned by the White House and shut out by the Democrats.
They try accommodation. They try confrontation. But in a chamber where Democrats outnumber them 258 to 176, the Republicans never manage to lift themselves from a permanent minority status that is essentially irrelevant to making policy. 
Most House Republicans do not even know what it is like to be consequential. Many were not even born in 1954, when their party last controlled the chamber, in the first Administration of Dwight D. Eisenhower.
Frustrated House Republicans have from time to time set out to be noticed. But even one of their political successes, at the start of the Reagan Administration, took Democrats to engineer. A group of Southern conservative Democrats, known as the ''boll weevils,'' broke with their party in 1981 and helped push Ronald Reagan's first budget through the House.
A year later, a group of mostly Northeastern and Middle Western Republicans, known as ''gypsy moths,'' joined Democrats opposed the Reagan economic program.
But mostly, House Republicans have been known for taking the lead of Robert H. Michel, the House Republican leader, and seeking to work with the majority.
Enter Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, who in 1988 seized on Republican restlessness and led a war of words against Speaker Jim Wright that ended in Mr. Wright's resignation amid charges of ethics violations and Mr. Gingrich's election to Republican whip, the No. 2 minority House post.
But the assertiveness has only heightened the House minority's second-fiddle role. While House Democrats were meeting over the budget the other day in what Representative Charles Wilson, a Texas Democrat, described as a partisan ''love-in -like a revival meeting,'' Republicans were dickering over their own budget strategy in what Representative Chuck Douglas, a New Hampshire Republican, described as ''three hours of spleen-venting.''
House Republicans remain divided over whether the budget alternative they are drafting should include any tax increases. Nor are they ready to agree with Mr. Bush that a deep cut in the capital gains tax now seems out of the question.
''The Republicans have got to bury their animosities,'' said Representative Ralph Regula of Ohio. ''I don't see we have a choice. We were sent here to govern, not to throw bombs at each other.''
But the only thing Republicans in the House seem to share these days is hostility at Republicans in the White House for what the lawmakers say is their high-handed tactics in dealing with them - or rather, not dealing with them.
They will not stand for a budget that was drafted by Democrats, they insist. At the same time, they concede that their only recourse, helping sustain a Presidential veto of an unacceptable budget, is hardly one that will move the process forward.
Not everyone discounts the power of thwarting the legislative process.
''They cannot necessarily enact their own legislation, but they certainly can be obstructionist,'' said John Buckley, a political consultant who has worked extensively with House Republicans. ''They are defined in the negative just like a President who only rules by veto is defined in the negative. But they can use that very effectively.''
Maybe so. For a week or two. Pursuing a ''burn down the House'' strategy of discrediting Congress in the hope that voters will throw out incumbents and elect more Republicans, Mr. Gingrich led the break of House Republicans against the budget plan announced in the Rose Garden two Sundays ago.
But this week, the House Republicans and the man they rallied around found that they were being dismissed as loud-mouthed mischief makers, whose rejection of the Democratic-sponsored budget doesn't even matter.
''Mr. Gingrich made a very big mistake in terms of judgment of what's good for the country and for the party,'' said Representative Bill Frenzel of Minnesota, the ranking Republican on the Budget Committee and a supporter of the initial budget compromise. ''He made two many damn television appearances expressing his opinion.''

HEADLINE: Virginia Governor Baffles Democrats With Crusade for 'New Mainstream'

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RICHMOND

 BODY:
With the fervor of an evangelist and with his eyes seemingly on a larger prize, Gov. L. Douglas Wilder has embarked on a nationwide crusade for the political moderation that helped him become the first black ever elected chief executive of an American state.
Hardly a week passes that he does not venture out of Virginia, sometimes two and three times, to spread the gospel of his ''new mainstream'' values. He bluntly lectures fellow Democrats, especially those in Washington, that the party will never recapture the White House unless it veers back to ''fiscal responsibility,'' and he calls for cuts in Federal spending and holding the line on new taxes.
Most recently he has attacked - and infuriated - Democrats who support tax increases as a way to help balance the Federal budget, accusing them of misjudging the political potency of moderation.
 
Nudging Party to the Right
In effect, Mr. Wilder is making a concerted effort to nudge the Democratic Party to the right, to move it to the center where elections are usually won. It is an unusual political move for a black Democrat, but it is one that worked for Mr. Wilder at the state level in the gubernatorial election last year, when he put together a multiracial coalition of Democrats and independents, and it is one he is certain would work nationally. 
It is also a move that has propelled Mr. Wilder high into the ranks of possible Vice Presidential contenders. He seems to enjoy the view from there.
''National issues affect Virginia,'' he said in a recent interview in his Richmond office. ''Many Virginians are among the great American 'new mainstream' that is becoming more and more fed up with the way this country is being governed. I intend to address that issue.''
The other day, as part of his crusade for the ''new mainstream,'' the Governor gave a speech in Washington. Then he sent a letter to Ronald H. Brown, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, in which he asserted that Democratic leaders were so out of touch with the nation's ''vast majority'' that they risked getting an ''early start'' on writing their memoirs.
''For the record,'' he added, ''I don't plan on writing my memoirs anytime soon.''
 
'It's Hard to Understand'
The spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee, Ginny Terzano, said the party's national leaders were puzzled by Mr. Wilder's criticism. ''It's hard to understand,'' she added, ''why he feels obligated to attack fellow Democrats when our goal has been clear from the start - no tax break for the wealthy and a fair shake for working people.''
But if some national Democratic leaders seem puzzled by Mr. Wilder's attack, others find merit in his approach. They note that in his 25 years in politics, he has often lashed out at fellow Democrats to make a point.
''Doug doesn't always do what I like but his mainstream message serves a real purpose,'' said Al From, the director of the Democratic Leadership Council, one of the party's more conservative organizations. ''It's a message Democrats need to hear and it carries real weight when it's delivered by a black.''
In the 10 months since Mr. Wilder was sworn in here on the lawn of the former Confederate Capitol, he has taken his crusade to more than half of the 50 states, touching down several times in delegate-rich giants like California, New York and Illinois and, lest anyone miss the point, also dropping in on Iowa and New Hampshire, where the Presidential caucuses and primaries start.
 
Cause for Concern to Jackson
He has been out of the state so often that there is some grousing that he is an ''absentee governor,'' paying too little attention to Virginia at a time when it is beginning to suffer seriously from the national economic squeeze. The headline on a recent Richmond News Leader article about his travels read, ''Wilder to Visit Virginia During Six-State Week.''
Mention the 1992 Presidential race these days, here or just about anywhere, and Mr. Wilder's name inevitably comes up. Because he is a black moderate, one line of reasoning goes, he would be the ideal Vice Presidential choice for the Democratic ticket, offering reassurance to the party faithful who fear the confrontational liberalism of the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
''I'm not running for anything - or away from anything,'' the Governor says. ''But I want to make one thing clear: I'm a governor who happens to be black, not a black who happens to be governor.''
Whatever the case, Mr. Jackson, who twice has unsuccessfully sought the Democratic Presidential nomination, seems to find Mr. Wilder cause for concern, as do some other black liberals. Mr. Jackson has worried aloud that the ''new mainstream'' might turn out to be a ''backwater'' or ''cesspool'' for the poor and disadvantaged.
Mr. Wilder says there is no reason to worry.
In Virginia, he contends, his ''new mainstream'' government is a compassionate government, but nevertheless a government that puts ''necessities before niceties'' and runs on a balanced budget, without new taxes.
Still, he boasts, by cutting bureaucratic bloat and consolidating programs, he has avoided a tax increase and headed off a $1.4 billion deficit in the state's budget.
''If the Federal Government cut the way Virginia cuts,'' he argues, ''they could save $70 to $80 billion a year and there'd be no need for any new taxes.''
 
Mixed Reviews in the State
Mr. Wilder, who under state law cannot run for a second term, a rare constriction in American politics, receives mixed reviews here thus far.
When he took office, he was careful to appoint cabinet members and agency heads who reflected the diverse voter coalition that elected him. Criticism was minimal.
He also strengthened ties with leaders of the Democrat-controlled State Legislature, where he served as a State Senator for 16 years, cementing those ties so well that the Legislature went along with most of his budget-tightening requests last spring.
But as he has begun to travel out of state more and make more of the everyday decisions that governors everywhere must make, dissatisfaction has begun to build.
In his most publicized move, Mr. Wilder ordered state agencies and schools to divest themselves of stocks held in companies doing business with South Africa. Many blacks, in and out of the state, roundly praised the move. But it was not well received at many schools and agencies, and the order was eventually changed to require divestiture only in cases in which a profit would be realized on the stocks at the time of sale.
 
Appointment Riles Educators
There is also widespread grousing among the state's educators and editorialists about the Governor's appointment of Patricia Kluge, the estranged wife of one of the world's wealthiest men, to the board of the University of Virginia. Critics contend she has little experience in education matters, and they point out that she and her estranged husband, John Kluge, have been major contributors to the university and, not incidentally, to Mr. Wilder's political campaigns.
Further, and perhaps more to the point, the critics note that the Governor, who is divorced, has sometimes been seen squiring Ms. Kluge.
Once he arrived at Charlottesville, her home, by state helicopter, setting off some grumbling that he had used state equipment for a private purpose. Worse, his friendship with Ms. Kluge, who is white, has resulted in some racial sniping, the whispered kind that was notably quiet in last year's election campaign.
 
Problem for Republicans
For Virginia Republicans, Mr. Wilder is a bit of a political puzzle.
They complain loudly about his heavy load of out-of-state travel and speaking engagements. But his rhetoric strikes some harmonious chords with them.
''I call him the 'Absentee Governor,' '' said Steve Haner, the director of the Joint Republican Caucus in the Virginia Legislature. ''On the other hand, I have to admit, with some bittersweet pleasure, that what he's advocating outside the state is basically our agenda. He used to be a tax-and-spend politician himself but now he's stolen our music, hypocrite and opportunist that he is.''

HEADLINE: MENEM'S REFORMS PROVOKE BACKLASH

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Oct. 13

 BODY:
For a President who likes to duck his bodyguards, drive his own car, frequent the nightspots and soccer stadiums and generally mix with the throngs, the reviews that Carlos Saul Menem gets from the people these days are disquieting.
While his personal charm and audacity are still popular, the man who likes to be liked is encountering a growing public reaction against policies intended to change Argentina into a free-market state aligned with the United States and other developed nations. Some people oppose those policies on principle, and others are angry because they suffer economically from them.
At a recent public appearance, a young woman approached Mr. Menem with a disarming smile and then proceeded to deliver a tongue-lashing while many in the audience booed him. 
When he went to Argentina's southernmost region, Tierra del Fuego, state workers shouted insults until he gave up trying to speak. 'Puppet' for Bush? Perhaps worse, Congress seldom passes the legislation he proposes and his Peronist party is leaving him to govern largely alone, with a small circle of trusted people, many of them from outside the party. One of the leaders of the Peronist opposition to Mr. Menem recently accused him of playing ''the role of Latin American puppet'' for President Bush.
Since assuming the presidency 15 months ago, Mr. Menem has sought to revive a prostrate economy by turning back a system of heavy state control and subsidies. Over half a century, an interlocking network of increasingly corrupt and inefficient state companies and private contractors and suppliers had drained the treasury; a disillusioned populace had sent most of its wealth abroad and simply refused to pay taxes.
Mr. Menem has been putting state companies and oil rights on the auction block by the dozens. At a time when many other countries are doing the same, it has been a struggle to convince would-be investors from home and abroad that the Argentine firms are attractive business deals.
He has faced and shrugged off complaints from his party and the Radical Civic Union, the chief opposition, that he is giving away the national patrimony too cheaply and too haphazardly.
By those privatizations, Mr. Menem hopes to eliminate the fiscal deficit, wipe out a good chunk of the $65 billion foreign debt by permitting buyers to exchange debt paper for equity in Argentine companies, and bring improved technology and modern business methods to Argentina through foreign buyers or local managers liberated from state controls.
 
Return From Isolationism
The other part of Mr. Menem's strategy is to seek a respectable place for a country that has lived in isolation for most of this century, beginning at a time when Argentina was so rich from the sale of wheat and hides to a poor and war-torn Europe that it thought it could afford to close its doors and enjoy its wealth.
The decision to send two Argentine ships and 300 men to join those massed against Iraq in the Persian Gulf was an important part of the strategy to change the country's isolationist image and convince Washington that Argentina is a reliable ally. But the action has been criticized by a number of other Latin American countries and by many in the Argentine Congress.
So far, most Argentines see few benefits from Mr. Menem's policies, admittedly of longer-term impact. Inflation, while no longer considered out of control, has been running a worrisome 15 percent a month for several months. Unemployment is climbing steadily, mostly due to layoffs in private industry because Mr. Menem has not yet dared to confront the well-organized public workers with the massive layoffs that may be necessary if he is to keep his commitment to cut spending.
 
Tax Collections Falling
While the fiscal deficit has been falling rapidly, that is mainly because of painful increases in tariffs for public services and because of money coming in from privatizations, not because of reduced expenditures. Tax collections are falling, partly because of the slow economy, but mostly because the Government lacks the database on which to make collections.
Economists are also worried over the fact that the United States dollar -the hard currency to which economic life in Argentina is tied - has steadily declined on the free-exchange market, doubling the cost of living here in dollar terms over the last six months.
Government actions at the beginning of the year that froze most bank deposits and left people with nothing with which to trade for dollars, a common practice to hedge against inflation, are said to have caused the increase.. The dollar market in Argentina, as in most of Latin America, has always reacted to internal factors, not to the money markets in Europe and Japan or to the strength or weakness of the United States economy.
The main negative effect of the cheap dollar and expensive austral, the local currency, is that it makes Argentine exports less competitive. There are reports of some industries simply shutting down export operations because they are unprofitable. But the Government fears that loosening monetary controls would set off the kind of inflation that hit 200 percent a month as Mr. Menem took office.

HEADLINE: Hanoi's Foreign Minister Works the U.S. Circuit Seeking End to Trade Ban

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE

 BODY:
Like a salesman opening up a new territory, Nguyen Co Thach, Vietnam's peripatetic Foreign Minister, is knocking on doors and seeking friends among America's members of Congress, diplomats, scholars and bankers, in the hope of ending Washington's trade embargo against his country.
A 66-year-old member of Vietnam's ruling Politburo and one of its main proponents of economic reform, Mr. Thach is visiting the United States for a meeting scheduled for Wednesday with Gen. John W. Vessey, the special Presidential adviser on issues involving American servicemen missing or taken prisoner in Vietnam.
At the same time, Mr. Thach is telling Americans that it is time to end the hostile aftermath of the Vietnam War and get on with normal relations. He feels, moreover, that an end to the long estrangement is finally in sight. In his words, ''there is light at the end of the tunnel.'' 
In vernacular American English salted with parodies of Washington cliches popular during the Vietnam War, Mr. Thach told listeners last week that no substantive issues remain to bar diplomatic relations between the United States and Vietnam.
 
'Can Be Settled Easily'
''Cambodia and the P.O.W.-M.I.A. issue were the two thorniest obstacles, but I think those issues can be settled easily now,'' he said in an interview.
''I'm going to tell General Vessey that he can have anything he wants,'' he said. ''He can go anywhere he wants in Vietnam to investigate the M.I.A. question. The only places he might not be welcome would be inside our Defense and Interior Ministries.''
Vietnam and the United States agree on keeping foreign troops out of Cambodia, he said, adding: ''At the same time, both your country and ours want to make sure that Cambodia never again experiences the genocide committed by Pol Pot's regime. We have to be sure of that. We must rely on the Cambodian people themselves to make sure the terrible slaughters of the late 1970's never recur. We Vietnamese cannot go back a second time. We have done enough to save the Cambodian people.''
The Khmer Rouge Government of Pol Pot were ousted by an invading Vietnamese Army in 1979, which established a pro-Vietnamese Government in Phnom Penh. After a decade of fighting rebel forces - including rival factions supporting Pol Pot and Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Cambodia's ruler from 1953 to 1970 - the bulk of Vietnamese forces left Cambodia last year.
Mr. Thach said Vietnam would have no objection to Prince Sihanouk's return to power, ''provided the Pol Pot butchers were not part of the arrangement.''
 
Sees Big Changes in Vietnam
He told a group of foreign affairs specialists meeting at the Asia Society in New York on Thursday that major changes are under way in Vietnam.
''We realized that without large reforms we could go nowhere,'' he said, ''but in this rapidly changing world, we have learned some important lessons both from China and the countries of Eastern Europe.
''From China and the Tiananmen incident, we learned that you cannot have economic reform without political reform. From the troubles we see today in Eastern Europe, we learned that you cannot have political reform without economic reform. These reforms must go together.''
To guide Vietnam in its transformation, he said, both he and Prime Minister Do Muoi have come to rely on a Vietnamese translation of ''Economics,'' a standard college textbook written by Paul Samuelson, an American economist who won a Nobel prize in 1970. ''We keep it on our night tables as bedtime reading,'' he said.
''In 1986 we were on the brink of economic catastrophe,'' he said. ''Today we still have formidable problems, but we have turned things around. For the first time, Vietnam has begun to export rice instead of importing it. Because we devalued our currency, we are now exporting much more than we did. And partly thanks to Paul Samuelson's book, we found loopholes in your trade embargo.''
 
'Government of the People'
Asked if Hanoi's reforms might soften the harshly authoritarian style of its Communist Government, he replied: ''That's an interesting question. After 40 years we have come to realize that government cannot be simply of and for the state.
''What we are trying to do is have a government of the people, by the people and for the people. Before, decisions were made by only 100 people, and some of those decisions were nonsense. What sense is there is an economic decision that makes one duck egg equal in value to five kilograms of steel? We are ending the governmental compartmentalization that led to such rules. We know now that decisions must be made by 65 million people, not just 100.''
In fact, the structure of the Vietnamese Government remains that of a traditional Marxist-Leninist dictatorship, although its economic policies have changed markedly in the last four years.
But Vietnam's bureaucrats sometimes have difficulty adjusting to customs in free-market societies, he said.
 
Asking Beggar for Receipt
''The other day a Vietnamese driver from our United Nations Mission here was stopped by one of those people in the street who ask for money,'' Mr. Thach said. ''The driver gave him something, but then insisted on having a receipt, because at home, we must account for everything. Things are done differently here.''
Asked about the Soviet military presence in Vietnam, notably the American-built naval base at Cam Ranh Bay, Mr. Thach replied: ''The big powers want military disengagement at this point, and it's not in anyone's interest to stress military involvement. The Soviets withdrew from Cam Ranh Bay last year, and we don't intend to ask them to stay on.''
Mr. Thach met on Sept. 27 and 29 with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d. It was the first high-level encounter between the two Governments since the 1973 peace agreement. The Vietnamese Foreign Minister did not disclose details of his conversations, except to say they had been friendly.
But he added: ''Americans must understand that international agreements go two ways, not like the streets in New York City. In any case, we can wait a bit longer for trade and diplomatic relations if we must. International relations don't work like fast-food restaurants. It's been many years already, and we can finally see light at the end of the tunnel.''
 
His Movements Limited
Despite the importance attached to Mr. Thach's visit by many officials and economists, his movements in the United States have been strictly limited by the State Department, since the United States does not recognize the Hanoi Government.
Mr. Thach is permitted to visit New York since Vietnam is a member of the United Nations, but he may not travel beyond 25 miles of the United Nations headquarters. As a result, he was unable to go to an informal meeting of foreign affairs specialists arranged last weekend by a Vietnamese-American friend, Dao Spencer, at her home in East Hampton, L.I.
For his meeting with General Vessey, Mr. Thach has been cleared by the State Department to travel to Washington, but only for one day.
He dismissed such inconveniences with a smile, saying: ''One way or another, we get to talk to our American friends. That's certainly progress, isn't it?''

HEADLINE: EVOLUTION IN EUROPE;
Ethnic Rivalries Push Yugoslavia to Edge

BYLINE: By CHUCK SUDETIC, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, Oct. 11

 BODY:
Intensifying conflicts and rivalries among Yugoslavia's republics are bringing the country dangerously close to the breaking point, say people who favor the process as well as those who fear it.
Nerves are fraying throughout the country. In Slovenia, the Government has deployed its own armed guards to underscore claims that the republic's sovereignty is paramount. In Croatia, gangs of heavily-armed Serbs have blocked roads in the enclaves where they are numerically strong. In Serbia's Kosovo region, ethnic Albanians speak openly of armed uprising. Travel from republic to republic, and the inventory of conflicts grows. 
An international effort may soon be needed to head off a conflagration, Slovenia's Prime Minister, Lojze Peterle, said this week.
A dream of 19th-century Slav Romantics, Yugoslavia is now a crumbling mosaic of peoples of Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic or Muslim traditions who have lived since World War II in a federation.
 
Communists Muffled Quarrels
Though conflicts and vendettas laced the region for years, for much of the postwar period national unity was advanced by a modicum of prosperity and the now-defunct Yugoslav Communist Party's monopoly of power, which muffled the quarrels.
Much like the erosion of central power and rise of nationalist emotions in the Soviet Union, the breakdown of Communist-imposed unity and the emergence of democratic openness in Yugoslavia have released long-suppressed national aspirations, envies and antagonisms.
Democratically elected, non-Communist Governments now hold sway in Slovenia and Croatia, the country's richest and most Western-minded republics. Communists, under a variety of guises, still run the other four republics, but elections are scheduled in each before year's end.
Yugoslavia's central political conflict, like the states' rights clash in pre-Civil War America, pits backers of a loose confederation of independent states against advocates of a formidable federal Government.
 
Different Manifestations
The Slovenian and Croatian Governments have already written a model confederal agreement and threatened to secede from Yugoslavia if one cannot be worked out. Serbia, the most populous republic, advocates strengthening the federal Government. The Slovenes and Croats object to it as a veiled attempt to create a Greater Serbia.
While the confederation-federation problem lies at the core of Yugoslavia's troubles, the problem manifests itself differently according to republic.
Unencumbered by minority enclaves, the Alpine Slovenes, who held their own against German cultural domination for centuries, can make a relatively clean break from Yugoslavia.
Two weeks ago, the republic's Parliament took broad steps away from the present federation, approving a motion that said Slovenia's constitution was the supreme law of the land.
The change galled Yugoslavia's federal presidency and its Communist-dominated army, whose officer corps is about 70 percent Serb. When both threatened action to defend the federal Constitution, the Slovenes took offense.
 
Age-Old Conflict Returns
''It seems there are elements that don't want the Slovenes to remain in the country but for them to pull out as soon as possible,'' said Janez Drnovsek, Slovenia's representative to the federal presidency, speaking about Serbia's backers in the presidency. ''They aren't looking for real solutions but are instead forcing conflicts and reducing chances for an agreement.''
In Croatia, a onetime province of Hungary that craved self-rule for centuries, the age-old conflict between the Orthodox Serbs and Catholic Croats has returned to center stage.
The Croatian Government's vow to create a sovereign state has piqued the republic's Serbs, who account for 11.5 percent of its population and live in self-proclaimed autonomy mainly in counties adjacent to the border with the republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
Serbs have a tradition of armed resistance and a memory of atrocities committed by Croatia's wartime Fascist regime. That memory has spawned a deep fear of Croatian nationalism. Crude, sensationalist disinformation spread by Serbian demagogues and Belgrade's Government-backed media has whipped up the Serbs' fears to a dangerous frenzy.
When the Croatian police tried to confiscate weapons from police stations in Serb-populated counties, gangs of Serbs toting automatic weapons, shotguns and hand grenades - often heisted from police and territorial defense arsenals - took to the woods and barricaded Croatian roads. Randon gunfire has crackled across the counties for years, and bomb explosions have gutted stores and cut a rail line.
 
Frequent Reassurance Ineffective
Croatian officials assure the Serbs almost daily that they have nothing to fear, but impolitic campaign language about restoring Croatia's ''historic borders'' and the barring of some 20,000 Serbs from a commemoration at the site of a former concentration camp have deepened the Serbs' paranoia.
Croatian leaders from across the political spectrum charge Serbia's Government with inciting the Serbs in order to smother Croatia's fledgling democracy and create a pretext for army intervention. For now, the Croatian Government has only asked the Serbs to surrender the stolen weapons, but officials have warned that Zagreb will resort to force if necessary.
In Serbia, which reclaimed its independence last century after 450 years of Ottoman tyranny, gypsy street bands are doing a thriving business playing World War I marches.
Serbia's renamed Communist Party, led by the authoritarian Slobodan Milosvic and a host of party careerists, shows no sign of loosening its grip on power. Rather, Mr. Molosvic appears to be positioning Serbia to grab the best deal possible, including territorial gains, in the emerging new order.
Mr. Milosvic has warned that if it comes to confederation, all of Yugoslavia's internal borders would be called into question. In the past two weeks, the main theme of Belgrade's press has shifted from bolstering Serbia's territorial integrity to protecting Serbs outside Serbia. A similar focus preceded Mr. Milosvic's engineering of Serbia's takeover of the troubled Kosovo region last year.
 
Apartheid of Sorts Results
In Kosovo, home to a 90 percent ethnic-Albanian population, Mr. Milosvic's Government is using Procrustean tactics to secure ''rule of law'' and reorganize a third world economy.
An apartheid of sorts has resulted. Schools are divided; thousands of Albanians have lost their jobs, and Serbs have been dispatched to fill key positions.
While Albanians in smoky Pristina taverns speak openly of armed insurrection and secession from Serbia and Yugoslavia, the Serbian police go house to house ferreting out weapons caches.
Western diplomats here predict a bloodbath and a massed forced exodus if an uprising breaks out. But with the regional Parliament dissolved and the Albanian-language press virtually silenced, the Albanians have few legal outlets to vent their frustrations.
Many Yugoslavs fear an eruption of turmoil in ethnically mixed Bosnia-Herzegovina, Europe's original powder keg and a killing field during World War II.
 
Parties Follow National Lines
The campaign for next month's elections has already produced the organization of political parties along national lines. Croat and Muslim-Slav parties back a sovereign Bosnia-Herzegovina and confederation; Serbs, fearing a Croat-Muslim coalition, threaten war if the future Parliament opts for anything other than a federation.
As a compromise solution, Radovan Karadzic, president of the republic's Serbian Democratic Party, describes a future federation that would include Serbia and Montenegro, most of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Serb-populated Croatian counties and perhaps Macedonia. Not surprisingly, Croats and Muslim-Slavs dismiss this as Greater Serbia.
With memories of wartime brutality still vivid, many people in Bosnia-Herzegovina cling to the hope that the Yugoslav-oriented Communists or the reform party of Prime Minister Ante Markovic will win enough seats to keep the nationalist parties at bay.

HEADLINE: Remembering a Tortured Child Who Lived in the Streets of Guatemala City

BYLINE: By LINDSEY GRUSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GUATEMALA

 BODY:
The marble tombstone erected here last week for Nahaman Carmona Lopez says more about his death than his short life: ''I only wanted to be a child and they wouldn't let me.''
The 13-year-old street urchin died in March after four policemen found him sniffing glue to mask his wracking hunger pains. The officers, witnesses said, yanked him into the air by his ears, threw him to the ground and kicked him into unconsciousness, rupturing his liver and breaking six ribs.
The epitaph, added to the tombstone to mark the six-month anniversary of his killing, would serve as well for any of the 40 or so other children killed this year in the underground campaign being waged by the police. 
In one June incident, eight children were kidnapped from a downtown street by men in a jeep. Investigators said the bodies of three of the boys were found shortly thereafter bearing messages written in torture: their ears had been sliced off and their eyes burned out. And in a traditional warning to witnesses against going public with anything they see or hear about the security forces, their tongues had been carved out.
''Hopefully they were killed first, but that's not the way it's usually done here,'' said Bruce Harris, the regional director here of Covenant House, the New York-based child welfare organization that unveiled the tombstone as part of a campaign in behalf of the street children and against the police crackdown.
 
Rise in Abject Poor
The tombstone also serves as a silent protest against the often-hidden economic crisis that is ravaging this country and the rest of Latin America. After a decade of almost uninterrupted recession, a job is little more than a fading memory for the vast majority of Guatemalans. Poverty has swallowed thousands of formerly middle class families, pushing the already poor into desperate straights.
Almost 9 in 10 Guatemalan families now live in poverty - earning just enough money for food, but not for medicine, housing and schools. That is up from one in three a decade ago, according to statistics recently released by the United Nations that concur with other figures and are considered as reliable as any.
According to the United Nations study, the number of abject poor -those who are unable to feed themselves - jumped from one in eight to almost one in three during the 1980's, which has come to be known throughout Latin America as ''The Lost Decade.''
This desperate plight is repeated from country to country across the region. Even in Costa Rica, the richest and most stable of the isthmus's six countries, two of five families are unable to afford basic necessities. In a vicious circle, the economic crisis there has forced the deficit-plagued government to cut social services, hurting those who need help most.
Children, like Nahaman, have been among the hardest-hit victims. A survey completed earlier this year by the United Nations Children's Fund, UNICEF, found that a decade of civil war in El Salvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala had turned two million people into refugees; half are children under 16. In El Salvador, half the children under 5 are malnourished. In Honduras, 60 poor children die every day. Despite plenty of rich farmland in most Central American countries, infant mortality has risen sharply. In several countries it has almost doubled in the last decade in many areas; some put the number as high as 120 per 1,000 live births.
 
Forced into Prostitution
Unable to feed their children, a growing number of families have abandoned them to the streets, where they join orphans and runaways. In a recent report, Amnesty International estimated there were at least 5,000 street urchins in downtown Guatemala. Other officials say there are slightly fewer. While there are no reliable estimates for the citywide total, all officials agree that the number has risen dramatically and that there may be 10,000 street children living in the capital.
''Street children are children who have nobody,'' said Mr. Harris, whose risky campaign in their behalf is a direct challenge to the often brutal police and has earned the praise of Western diplomats and international human-rights groups. ''They have no voice, but their silence is deafening. The abuse is overwhelming.''
Many of the boys and girls are forced into prostitution, which is centered in Concordia Park across the street from the police headquarters. Others survive by petty thievery and by sniffing cobblers' glue. A 50-cent container can last a day, doled out a few tablespoons at a time into a plastic bag. When warmed by pressing the bag against the skin, it gives off intoxicating fumes, which normally are shared by the myriad small gangs that loiter downtown.
''It gives them a high to escape reality and the courage to rob,'' said Mr. Harris as he hugged Moses, a 13-year-old addict who broke the embrace to inhale from a white plastic bag containing an amber puddle of glue. ''It dulls the hunger and warms the cold.''
The police blame the children for much of the omnipresent crime that has turned this city of broad avenues and volcanic ravines into an urban battle ground. Under intense pressure to control what is widely seen as spreading anarchy, the authorities have cracked down. Officers often punish the street children by pouring glue on their heads, forcing them to shave their hair.
 
New Police Commander
But several recent investigations have determined that the police have also started a brutal campaign, similar to ''the dirty war'' against leftists that led to the deaths of tens of thousands of Guatemalans in the early 1980's. In one recent report, Children's Rights International, a Pennsylvania-based child advocacy group, found a pattern that ''includes extrajudicial executions, cruel and life-threatening extrajudicial punishments, beatings and attempts to intimidate witnesses to a fatal beating and the harassment of Covenant House street workers.''
Col. Julio Caballeros Selgne, a hard-liner who was recently appointed commander of the National Police, did not respond to repeated requests for interviews. But in the past the police have denied a pattern of abuse and have announced a program of ''street teachers,'' who are supposed to encourage children to enter special centers.
Under increasing pressure, the police arrested four officers in the death of Nahaman. But Mr. Harris, noting that no Guatemalan security officer has ever been convicted of human-rights abuse, said he was skeptical that they would be prosecuted.
''The kids never believed they had any rights, they never have had any trust,'' he said. ''If they let the four policemen out, I'm concerned it will destroy the little faith they now have.''

Governing Board Lifts the Curtain On Its Decisions

DATELINE: SWARTHMORE, Pa.

 BODY:
In an effort to demystify decision-making at Swarthmore College, the school's board of managers last weekend opened its doors for the first time to designated student and faculty observers.
The governing board decided in May to allow two students and two faculty members to attend its quarterly meetings and observe firsthand how the board makes its decisions.
''We didn't want the decision-making procedure to be a mystery,'' said J. Lawrence Shane, the board member who was chairman of an ad hoc board committee that recommended the change. 
Neil Austrian, the board's chairman, said the observers were not full board members and were not expected to engage in discussions as actively as members do. He said they were barred from executive sessions dealing with personnel, salaries and other confidential matters.
 
Opinions to Be Sought
Nevertheless the observers will ''from time to time be called upon for their views and opinions'' and will relay general impressions and issues from meetings to the rest of the community, Mr. Austrian said.
The Student Council selected one student for a one-year term and one for a two-year term after soliciting applications from juniors and seniors. The faculty observers were appointed to similar terms by the Council on Faculty Procedures, which regularly assigns teachers to various campus committees.
For the last few years the Student Council has requested student participation at board meetings so students would be included in decisions that affect them. But until May, the board hesitated to allow observers for fear of stifling discussion.
Mr. Shane said that while he was unaware of a similar push for faculty representation, ''we felt having both groups observing would be a very positive thing.'' He said student and faculty observers would attend meetings for at least the next two years, after which the board will evaluate their effectiveness.
Mr. Austrian said he ''didn't feel that discussion was inhibited in any way'' because of the presence of observers at the last meeting.
 
Narrowing a Gap
Karen Fank, a student observer, said: ''There has been a big rift between the students and the board. That gap has to be filled in order for students to have a legitimate voice here.''
Ms. Fank, a senior political science major from Hamilton Square, N.J., said she wanted to observe meetings to help narrow the gap.
Although Ms. Fank was unable to attend the main portion of the meeting because of a previously scheduled law school exam, she said the interactions she did have with board members were positive. ''I really felt that I was taken seriously,'' she said.
Stephanie Hirsch, the other student observer, said, ''I thought the board members acted in good faith.'' A junior English major from Eau Claire, Wis., she said that although the observers did not speak during the meeting, they were able to talk informally during breaks and at a dinner.
One of the faculty observers, Bernard Saffran, an economics professor, said that while there had not been communication problems with the faculty in the past, having observers ''is a very useful, helpful thing.''
''The more people know about what everyone else is doing, the better people are,'' Professor Saffran said. ''Too much secrecy can get in the way of decision-making.''
The other faculty observer is Nathalie Anderson of the English department.
The observers plan to disseminate information to the community through faculty meetings, the student newspaper and a public debriefing after each meeting.

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE VIEW;
Raising the Architectural Ante In California

BYLINE: By Paul Goldberger

DATELINE: LA JOLLA, Calif.

 BODY:
Few careers in architecture are as vexing as that of Michael Graves. From academic modernist in the 70's to post-modernist superstar in the 80's, he could turn in the 90's into a venerable elder statesman or a tired has-been. It's a matter not only of Mr. Graves's architecture but of our architectural culture, of which his career has for years been a kind of crucible. He rode the wave of architectural celebrity as it mounted in the early 1980's, becoming almost a cult figure after his first large-scale works, the Portland Building in Portland, Ore., and the headquarters of Humana Inc. in Louisville, Ky., were completed. He argued persuasively for an expanded role for the architect, designing everything from furniture to teakettles, although when he turned to Bloomingdale's shopping bags, he seemed less like a man eager to broaden the arena of serious design than one willing to put his name on anything that could be sold.
The fiasco of Mr. Graves's three unbuilt schemes for additions to the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, all of which have been criticized (sometimes excessively) as being unsympathetic to the original Whitney building by Marcel Breuer, did his reputation no more good. By the end of the decade, a lot of people had begun to find his work both self-conscious and tiresome. 
Yet through all this, Mr. Graves has continued to design buildings that can be described not only as serious but as reminders that he possesses one of the few truly original American architectural voices of our time. His style, which is a kind of classicism filtered through the lens of cubism, blends elements of several architectural vernaculars - he seems particularly to favor the buildings of the American Southwest and the Spanish Mission style - with Italianate classicism, bathing it all in a rich palette of deep and sensuous color. It will never be un-self-conscious - its virtues are more those of the mannerist than the naif - but at its best it can exert a powerful pull.
I have never been so sure that Mr. Graves's work comes off best at large scale: his unquestioned triumphs, buildings like the library at San Juan Capistrano, Calif., or the redesign of the interiors of the Newark Museum, are fairly small in size. By contrast, the Portland Building is awkward, and Humana, although striking, works mainly because of the elegance of his materials and the inventiveness of its detailing. The two large hotels Mr. Graves recently completed at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla., have spectacular Graves-designed fabrics and furnishings on the inside, but their exterior proportions are so far from graceful that it makes one think Mr. Graves may be the only major architect who consistently tries to make a virtue out of clunkiness.
But here at La Jolla, 10 miles north of San Diego, Mr. Graves may have finally proved that he can do convincing large-scale, commercial work. On a hilly, 11-acre site beside Interstate 5, he has just finished a project called the Aventine, named after one of the seven hills of Rome, and it is the smoothest intersection yet between Mr. Graves's style and the demands of conventional real-estate development. Mr. Graves has contended for years that his architecture was neither so strange visually nor so daunting economically that it could not be put up by real-estate developers, and here we have proof that it can, indeed, be done. The Aventine is both striking and appealing - not only one of the few suburban high-rise complexes with real architectural identity but one of the only such projects that try to bring to a suburban site some sense of urbanity.
The $150 million project consists of a 16-story, 400-room Hyatt Regency hotel, an 11-story office building, a health club and four restaurants. The buildings are sheathed in red Indian sandstone on their lower floors, with maize- and tan-colored stucco above. As in most of Mr. Graves's buildings, the geometries are strong: the Hyatt is a slab topped by a low arc, the health club a circular drum, and the office building a cluster of shapes - an oblong low box, a high box with a gabled roof, and a silolike tower. Linking the various sections of this composition of circles and rectangles is a series of pergolas, fountains and courtyards that raise the project above the level of a simple exercise in basic geometries and create a degree of urbanistic interest for the pedestrian.
These buildings were built on a tight budget, like Mr. Graves's Disney hotels, the Dolphin and the Swan. But they are calmer, lower key, than the Disney buildings, in which the intensity of the design sometimes feels like a device to distract us from the underlying cheapness. Here, paradoxically, the effect of lowering the voltage is a sense of greater richness.
The facade of the La Jolla hotel, for example, lacks the spectacular effect of the Swan and the Dolphin, with their huge sculptured figures and swoops of color. But neither does it have the flatness that is so off-putting in those buildings; the gridded windows of the Hyatt are set in slightly from the facade, a small device that means everything in terms of giving the facade texture and depth, making it feel like a real masonry building, which is necessary for Mr. Graves's architecture to work as it should. The sandstone, yellowish stucco and panels of dark green make a superb palette of colors.
Inside, the lobby is understated and modest, but perfectly dignified, with marble-clad columns, handsome hanging light fixtures in glass bowls, Josef Hoffmann chairs and Graves-designed rugs. Stairs lead down from the lobby to the building's great hall, a two-story lounge with potted palms, restaurants, more Graves rugs and a virtual catalogue of Hoffmann furniture. The space is in the spirit of the grand lounges of classic resort hotels, and true to form it leads out to terraces, an immense pool with striped cabanas, and tennis courts. Upstairs, the corridors, elevators and small but serviceable guest rooms are all by Mr. Graves.
The low drum of the health club, clad all in red sandstone, is the visual centerpiece of the project, separating the hotel from the office structure. Its round form, topped by a rotunda, is the hinge on which the whole project turns, re-enacting at large scale the sense of rotation provided by the small rotundas Mr. Graves loves to use inside his buildings.
On the other side of the health club is the office structure, which Mr. Graves broke up into several sections to reduce its sense of mass. For all that this device serves its intended purpose, the office building may still be the least successful element of the project, if only because it seems to wear its classicism on its sleeve, taking itself much more seriously than the rest of the Aventine. (There is a rotunda off the lobby with a piece of Roman sculpture, a headless figure in a toga - not the sort of thing your average office lobby contains.) Yet the details are strong here, and the overall layout, which yields a subtly angled forecourt, is excellent. On balance, the Aventine is most remarkable as a composition, as a series of buildings that, for all their idiosyncrasy, come together in masterly fashion to create what virtually every other suburban high-rise development lacks: a sense of place.
From the freeway the Aventine is a compelling presence, and if its rich color and powerful geometric form are not what we expect from the suburban landscape (making it not surprising that conservative La Jolla is said to have been slow to warm to the project), it nonetheless raises the architectural ante in the realm of Southern California commercial real estate. Here Michael Graves's own architectural language meets the demands of the real world, and both come off the better for the encounter.

HEADLINE: THEATER;
Behind the Painted World of 'Once On This Island'

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH

 BODY:
In a time when sets for Broadway musicals can bump and grind with expensive mechanical wizardry and special effects, the design for ''Once on This Island'' is notable for its almost total reliance on extreme simplicity and hand-painted surfaces. The set for this fable-like Caribbean musical, which arrives on Broadway at the Booth Theater on Thursday, consists primarily of three walls and a floor painted with motifs of tropical vegetation. This framework exudes a sense of handmade and homemade more usual to a small, lovingly impastoed canvas or a spontaneously decorated folk art object in an intimate art gallery setting than to theater's communal space.
The ''Island'' set is the work of Loy Arcenas, a 37-year-old designer, born and raised in the Philippines, who has a growing list of regional and Off Broadway theater credits. About his style, Mr. Arcenas, who himself speaks sparely, says: ''I tend to be very lean. You don't have to fill the stage with a lot of things. What you need is the right moment with the right light. The design should be there to help. It has to flow with the way the play is written.'' 
Mr. Arcenas's esthetic of leanness was clearly at work in his pared-down sets for last season's ''Spunk,'' where a lone tree and a slatted backdrop reminiscent of a barn or shanty did most of the scenic work, and in ''Prelude to a Kiss,'' much of which takes place on an empty stage pierced by a heavily framed window into what seems like infinity. And it was especially pronounced in his designs for the original version of ''Once on This Island,'' seen Off Broadway last spring to great critical acclaim at Playwrights Horizons.
But what shines in the intimate embrace of small theater doesn't always translate to big-time, as Mr. Arcenas knows. His attempts to scale up the original ''Prelude'' set, his first design to move to Broadway (it had opened at the Circle Rep), did not elicit critical praise. In fact, Frank Rich, who had given the play a rave review in The Times, compared the scenic revisions to Stonehenge. And ''Island'' seemed to have the words ''small'' and ''intimate'' written all over it.
Based on the novel ''My Love, My Love'' by the Trinidadian author Rosa Guy, and with lyrics by Lynn Ahrens and music by Stephen Flaherty, ''Once on This Island'' is a model of expressive economy. Its circular tale of star-crossed love between a black peasant girl named Ti Moune and a mulatto aristocrat, or ''grandhomme,'' named Daniel, unfolds in 90 uninterrupted minutes of song and dance, storytelling and mime.
While the show's music shifts from calypso to African to soul, the story, which is set on a Caribbean island identified only as ''the jewel of the Antilles,'' moves from village hut to rain-drenched highway to luxurious city dwelling and back again. Similarly, the play's small, versatile cast of 11 assumes the various roles of storytellers and listeners, meddlesome gods, superstitious peasants or gossipy grandhommes.
At Playwrights Horizons, events had transpired on a stage that was small and without wings - far more constrained than the fully equipped stage at the Booth. Mr. Arcenas's solution to the space limitations at Playwrights, worked out with the play's director and choreographer Graciela Daniele, was to leave the stage almost entirely to the performers and to treat its enclosing surfaces like a painter's canvas.
The backdrop and side walls were painted with images of naively drawn palm trees and low undulating hills against a sky of deep patchy blue, while the floor was stained with green and brown, dotted with orange flowers and bordered with red. And all this with no loss of versatility. Despite its illusion of painted opacity, the back wall of the set was actually a scrim that would dissolve at certain points to reveal a starry night, hanging lanterns or the play's musicians.
The sources for Mr. Arcenas's Chagall-goes-tropical look include Rousseau, Matisse, Hockney, Mexican and Filipino Christmas ornaments, American weather vanes and Haitian metalwork. (Despite his stripped-down approach, Mr. Arcenas is also someone who says, ''I love the idea of found objects, of a borrowed look grabbed from different sources.'') The do-it-yourself improvisational quality of the play's few props maintains the story's fantasy aspect, yet also seems true to a reality where craft, ritual and poverty are all longstanding traditions.
The rain summoned by the water god Agwe, which causes Daniel's Mercedes to skid off the road and delivers him temporarily into the arms of Ti Moune, is conjured when the cast members enter carrying macabre yet festive black umbrellas draped with long strands of plastic. Daniel's room in the grandhomme mansion on the other side of the island is indicated by the descent of a large white patchwork quilt. And the flat, painted-wood figurative candelabra wheeled in for the dance at the grandhomme ball, where Ti Moune first meets Daniel's light-skinned fiancee, bring to mind an itinerate salesman's wagon or a traveling puppet show.
The strong marriage of folk motifs with sophisticated minimalist touches is hardly surprising, given Mr. Arcenas's background. The son of a doctor father and a banker mother, he abandoned pre-med studies at the University of the Philippines to become stage manager for the Manila Symphony, where classical fare alternated with fully staged 45-minute versions of opera and Broadway musicals. His sensibility was given more definition a few years later when he went to London and enrolled in the design course at the English National Opera. There, one of his teachers, Hayden Griffin, kept telling his students to eliminate as much as possible, stressing an approach that started from a single environment rather than building scene by scene. ''He would say you have to start from scratch,'' Mr. Arcenas said, ''and put in only what is necessary; otherwise you end up with decoration, and that's not stage design.''
Like an artist in his studio, Mr. Arcenas has spent a fair amount of time during the last three weeks waiting for paint to dry, worrying that his colors aren't deep enough or his surfaces not textured enough. The crew at the Booth learned how to use palette knives and he admits to ''driving the shop crazy. I think they thought it was going to be very simple, but they had to go over and over it to get the roughness we wanted. Otherwise it would have been just cute.''
It seems that the set has weathered the trip uptown in excellent form. In contrast to his ''Prelude'' expansions, it may even be that Mr. Arcenas has turned the demands of the Booth stage to his advantage, making simple additions and subtle expansions that may not only maintain the intimacy, but also clarify the esthetic character of his original set.
Some changes are relatively minor. The quilt, painted palm trees and candelabra have all been somewhat enlarged. The umbrellas are a little gaudier, adding to their sinister, voodoo quality. The brightly flowered tree, reminiscent of a papier-mache garland that descends at the story's end to symbolize the soul of Ti Moune, now does so in three stages. The side walls protrude several feet in from each side, keeping the stage area almost as small as it was at Playwrights and enabling the relatively small cast to maintain the play's compressed, roiling energy, despite the larger theater.
A most significant addition is a proscenium arch, a not unusual solution in translations from smaller to larger theaters. But this arch is a big red Caribbean-flavored post-and-lintel portal, seemingly carpentered of leftover packing crates and painted with stencil-like images of birds and leaves. All these changes, but the portal most of all, push forward the handmade folk-art aspect of the set, making it even more clear-cut than it was at Playwrights Horizons.
Musically, dramatically and visually, ''Once on This Island'' comes across as such a carefully crafted unit that it almost seems to be the work of one person, which also makes it an unusually clear illustration of the collaborative character of theater. The simple folkloric costumes and occasional masks, the work of Judy Dearing, are of a piece with Mr. Arcenas's setting. And Allen Lee Hughes's lighting adds effective suggestions of foliage or architecture, turning the painted blue sky to gold or red, or draining its color entirely. His efforts repeatedly ring in changes of place, weather or emotional tone and further animate Mr. Arcenas's carefully worked surfaces.
''It's not scenic painting, it is a painting,'' says Mr. Arcenas, sounding very much the artist. But his sense of teamwork is never far from the surface. ''My best designs happen when the director and I hit it off very, very well. If I don't have a Ping-Pong game of ideas, the design can be rather stale. Once the concept is in place, it's easy to fill in the blanks.''

What on Earth Is the Guggenheim Up To?

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

 BODY:
The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York City is to all outward appearances on hiatus, closed to visitors for another year, until construction ends on an annex. But in fact a kind of revolution is under way there, one that could have an impact well beyond the walls of Frank Lloyd Wright's spiral building - one that it is no exaggeration to say could alter the way art museums across the country do business and visitors experience these places.
During his roughly two-year tenure as director, Thomas Krens has proposed sweeping changes to transform what he seems to believe was a financially and intellectually moribund institution on upper Fifth Avenue into the cultural equivalent of a multinational conglomerate, with branches around the world, money pouring into the coffers and accolades showered on the high-profile team of curators he has assembled. To the cries of poverty that nowadays issue from virtually every public gallery in this country he has responded with a scheme holding out the promise of an enlarged collection and a burgeoning audience of grateful and enthusiastic visitors. Everyone is to benefit. The whole thing sounds too good to be true - and for many of America's leading museum professionals, who privately express reservations about Mr. Krens's strategies, it is. Mr. Krens and his colleagues at the Guggenheim contend that skepticism is the price of change, and even express some pride in the stir that has been caused. ''New York is a tough place, but it also respects achievement,'' said Mr. Krens recently in a wide-ranging conversation. ''You have to take some unpopular positions. If we are not strong enough to withstand moral and ethical challenges, then we shouldn't be here.''
The director believes that he has devised plans to prepare the museum for the fiscal and artistic realities of the late 20th century. But never has this question seemed more troubling or more pressing: At what cost progress?
To hear Mr. Krens, his staff and trustees tell it, the plans can seem inspiring. The Guggenheim owns one of the great collections of 20th-century European art. It has a branch in Europe, the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice. The vast majority of the roughly 6,000 works at the New York museum - as at many museums - is consigned to storage, since the Wright building provides exhibition space for only a fraction of the collection, and while the director says the annex will increase the room for display by more than half, the museum will still not be able to show most of its art when it reopens.
Why not find a way to exhibit the works in storage and, at the same time, use them to generate much-needed cash? And, if the situation presents itself, why not exhibit them abroad, at what are the equivalent of Guggenheim franchises? After all, the museum already has an international affiliation, and wouldn't it be better to care for the works at one's own franchise than to entrust these objects to other institutions? ''I would much rather lend to ourselves than anyone else,'' Mr. Krens says.
With the added money and space to be gained from the franchises, the museum could enhance its collection, expanding its holdings in the art of the last several decades, thereby fulfilling its role as a museum of the 20th century - the entire century. Few museums in the world are equipped to display the sort of monumental art that has become commonplace since the 1950's, including Minimalist sculpture. The Guggenheim, with its franchises, could become one of the few, and this, in turn, would make it all the more attractive to contemporary artists, who might donate or sell works to the museum.
Best of all, the cost of these franchised Guggenheims could be absorbed by the local governments, which would essentially be paying for the privilege of having part of a great collection on view, administered by a staff of Guggenheim curators. The Guggenheim itself would undertake no financial risk, Mr. Krens contends. And New Yorkers would benefit from a financially fortified museum, with a wider selection of works to go on view, many of them rotated from the franchises for occasional display on Fifth Avenue.
There would be other benefits. At a time when rising insurance costs and other problems make it more expensive and more complex to organize the sort of multi-museum loan exhibitions that have become a staple of the art world, the Guggenheim would be in a position to stage its own international touring shows, drawn from its own broad collection. What could be more sensible?
This, at least, is roughly how Mr. Krens and others at the museum explain their recent activities, which, on closer examination, seem to push at the edge of what has been standard museum practice and policy, and raise questions about the Guggenheim's commitment to safeguarding its collection.
 
Do Dangers Lurk In the Bond Sale?
 One key area involves the unusual way the museum has financed, through $54.9 million in tax-exempt bonds, the annex off Fifth Avenue and renovations on the existing building, an expansion plan initiated under Mr. Krens's predecessor, Thomas Messer. Mr. Krens describes the financing as a matter of economic necessity and prudent fiscal judgment. As he points out, cultural institutions like the Museum of Modern Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art have also issued bonds to finance building projects.
But at both of those institutions the full amounts of the bond issues were secured by funds from the endowments of the museums or from other sources, funds set aside as collateral for the bonds.
This is not the situation at the Guggenheim, where no collateral was put aside and a general agreement was made by the museum to honor its financial obligations. The Guggenheim's endowment is roughly $30 million, considerably less than the amount of the bonds. In negotiating its deal with Swiss Bank Corporation, which has supplied the museum with a letter of credit to secure the bonds, Mr. Krens and his colleagues refused to pledge works of art or the building as a guarantee against default.
Instead, they have come up with what they believe are conservative estimates of the financial growth of the museum, based on a fund-raising drive, higher revenues from a much-enlarged restaurant and bookstore, and an increase in annual attendance from roughly 500,000 to 750,000, despite a projected hike in the admission price from $4.50 to between $6.50 and $7.
Should trouble occur, the museum insists it will be able to avoid selling art. But nothing in the deal precludes the possibility, and Mr. Krens acknowledges that the value of certain paintings came up in discussions about the museum's assets with representatives of Swiss Bank. The bank would not say whether it supplied a letter of credit based on assessments about the Guggenheim's financial strength that took the art into account.
 
Is the Deaccessioning Going Too Far?
 It might be easier to feel comfort in the museum's contention that it would do everything necessary to safeguard the national treasure that is its permanent collection had Mr. Krens and the trustees not taken the troubling step last spring of selling, or deaccessioning, three important paintings.
Many museums sell works from their collections. But few museums lately have done anything involving works as valuable as the paintings by Modigliani, Chagall and Kandinsky that the Guggenheim sold at auction for $47 million - paintings that many other public institutions would have been proud to own. The canvases were sold to pay for more than 200 works from the 1960's and 70's owned by Count Giuseppe Panza di Biumo, some of which are only plans on paper.
The museum maintains that the works it sold were either lesser examples by artists already strongly represented in the Guggenheim, as with the Kandinsky, or lesser versions of paintings in other New York collections, as with the Chagall. In return, the museum's collecting activities have received what Mr. Krens calls a kick-start. He insists that the sales were the only way for the museum to raise the roughly $30 million needed for the Panza collection, since it was unreasonable to assume that the Guggenheim, which had not solicited donations on a major scale in years, could find the necessary benefactors in time to buy the collection. He adds that the deal restores some of the artistic heritage of New York by bringing back to the city works that were made here.
Mr. Krens does not mention that the Panza collection had been on the market for years, and that perhaps a more cautious approach would have delayed the sale of at least one of the paintings to see how much the others fetched at auction. Nor does he seem to have considered the possibility of selling the works to other public institutions, as occurred recently when a painting by Thomas Eakins was sold across the street from the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth to the Amon Carter Museum. As it happened, the three Guggenheim works went into private hands.
Mr. Krens repeatedly cites instances of sales by other museums and of financing deals for construction projects by museums outside New York City that resemble the Guggenheim's bond issue. It is also true that the Guggenheim is hardly the first institution to exploit the merchandising possibilities of an enlarged bookstore and restaurant.
In fact, to the nonprofit world of the museum - where the priorities have traditionally been on scholarship, connoisseurship and the conservation of art - the 43-year-old Mr. Krens brings what looks very much like a 1980's brand of corporate strategy, with its emphasis on multinational operations, splashy marketing techniques and risky ventures. The director with a master's degree in business from Yale is clearly hoping that what proved calamitous for businesses will be good for the Guggenheim.
 
Is Franchising The Right Route?
 Nothing points to this attitude more strongly than the prospective franchising of the Guggenheim. The Whitney Museum of American Art has several satellites around Manhattan and in Connecticut. But the Guggenheim is the first to explore the project on such an international scale. As to why the museum does not seek a place in or near New York at which to exhibit more of its collection, Mr. Krens again says that it would not be feasible to raise the money, although money has been raised for a modernized storage and conservation facility on the West Side of Manhattan, not open to the public. Instead, he is involved in feasibility studies for a site in Salzburg, Austria, a second site in Venice, and a site in the economically depressed town of North Adams, Mass., where he proposed three years ago - while still director of the Williams College Museum of Art in Williamstown, Mass. - the idea of transforming a gigantic abandoned complex of industrial buildings into the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art. According to staff members, the Guggenheim has agreed in principle to run Mass Moca, as it is called, like one of its franchises, if the state of Massachusetts comes up with some $35 million. Mr. Krens has also talked about Guggenheims in Japan and Spain.
There are many reasons to be concerned about such talk, for despite the museum's assurances that the works of art will be cared for properly, travel of any kind puts objects at risk. The prospect of having large portions of the Guggenheim's holdings rotating every several weeks or months or even years from one site to another around the world should cause alarm if only because the odds of a disaster inevitably increase as the number of traveling objects goes up.
And the number must rise, between the loans the museum will make to other institutions and the works it will need to put on view in the franchises if they develop as Mr. Krens hopes. Why, it can be asked, should paintings and sculptures donated to the Guggenheim with the implicit understanding that they contribute to the cultural life of New York be put at any risk for the sake of franchises in Salzburg or Tokyo?
There may also be a certain callousness in the Guggenheim's decision to entertain offers from Salzburg in particular, a city that, unlike New York, has no connection to 20th-century art, in a country whose reputation for anti-Semitism has not been lessened by the election of Kurt Waldheim.
To the possibility that the Guggenheim's collection - put together by prominent American Jews - might serve as a public relations device for Austria, Mr. Krens said only that Mr. Waldheim would probably be out of office by the time the museum opened.
As for Mass Moca, projections of a prosperous institution are based in part on attendance figures at places like the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute and the Williams College Museum of Art in Williamstown, a charming college town that could hardly be less like North Adams. Should the financial projections turn out to be wrong, the Guggenheim could find itself in a dilemma. On the one hand it can, as Mr. Krens says, simply walk away from the project, having built up the hopes of the people of North Adams for a revival of their town only to abandon them. It can, on the other hand, demonstrate the commitment to the community that would seem to be a fundamental purpose of any museum by investing money in the project, thus further taxing the Guggenheim's already strained resources.
But even if estimates of the financial situation prove accurate, Mass Moca and the other franchises could drain the Guggenheim in different ways. It is logical to argue - contrary to what Mr. Krens and his curators claim - that for the Guggenheim's staff to make of these smaller institutions something substantial would require an investment of time that could have been spent on New York.
So far, say Mark Rosenthal and Carmen Gimenez - two curators on a team that also includes Germano Celant and Diane Waldman - plans for the exhibitions and long-term displays in these franchises have not been formed, although there are vague ideas about mixing large- and small-scale works from different periods and about developing extensive holdings of works by certain contemporary artists.
The impression that real estate and international gamesmanship figure as prominently in the Guggenheim's planning as scholarship has only been enhanced by the addition to the museum's board of businessmen and politicians able to exercise influence over the projected franchises, like Gianni de Michelis, the Italian Foreign Minister, whose insensitivity to issues of cultural patrimony and whose inclinations to exploit art for financial purposes were suggested by his endorsement of the now-canceled Venice Expo 2000, a world's fair that would have further taxed an already fragile and overpopulated city. The impression has also been enhanced by the Guggenheim's recent schedule of exhibitions, including displays in Salzburg, Tokyo, Madrid and Venice of works from the permanent collection plus a Mondrian show in Venice, all of which serve to underscore to prospective partners the depth of the museum's holdings.
An exhibition in New York of works by Mario Merz, organized by Mr. Celant, and an installation by Jenny Holzer, organized by Ms. Waldman, dealt sensitively with the limitations of Wright's spiral design. But Mr. Krens's own disastrous exhibition of German painting last year, the major artistic undertaking at the museum under his tenure, was so crammed with gigantic paintings that it seemed designed to demonstrate the director's predilection for size as a virtue in itself and at the same time to argue for the annex.
 
A Course Fraught With Hazards
 It must be said that courting curators like Mr. Rosenthal - who has been responsible for such outstanding exhibitions as the retrospective of Anselm Kiefer that came to the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1988 - suggests a measure of seriousness about art on the part of Mr. Krens that his own exhibition lacked. Mr. Rosenthal is not a full-time staff member, however. He works as both adviser to private collectors and consultant to the Guggenheim.
Mr. Rosenthal's first exhibition will be a large-scale study of abstraction. Ms. Gimenez is working on a display, planned to coincide with the celebrations of the 500th anniversary in 1992 of the voyages of Columbus, that mixes art from the Americas and Europe. Mr. Celant is organizing a show of Italian art of the 1950's. Any full assessment of the Guggenheim under Mr. Krens must, obviously, await these events.
But what already seems evident is that the director has put forward bold ideas. At a moment when cooperation among public institutions might seem like the most constructive response to economic challenges, Mr. Krens is proposing an increasingly self-sustained institution. Most important, he appears to be acting not as the bulwark against the inclinations of business-minded board members - a role museum directors elsewhere have always considered crucial - but as a fellow entrepreneur, one who deals in art as a currency of trade. And for this reason especially, what he does will surely interest board members at other institutions, who may pressure their directors to follow him.
Mr. Krens has chosen to sail his museum on a course fraught with hazards. For the sake of not only the Guggenheim and the city of New York but also for the sake of cultural life in the cities across the country where museums look to his lead, one can only hope he doesn't run aground.

The sentencing of Michael Milken (''What Punishment Will Fit the Crime?'' Sept. 30) causes me to ask, what value did he create for the American economy? His ''innovations'' are akin to a pyramid scheme. The ''junk bonds'' that flooded the market are being discounted.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Enter the Dollar, Stage Left, Falling, Falling

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
In the fall of 1990, there has been no shortage of crises, with great attention being paid to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the budget deadlock, the plight of the banks and the plunging stock market.
But the slide of the dollar has not been deemed of much note. There is no outcry, in Washington or Wall Street. Perhaps there should be. 
There was far more attention paid Friday to the latest reported inflation figure, unsurprisingly showing that soaring oil costs pushed up producer prices last month. But if inflation is viewed as the declining value of a currency, it may be more relevant to note that the dollar last week lost 1.6 percent of its value against the West German mark, and is down 11.1 percent so far this year.
The lack of attention paid to the descending dollar can be traced in part to the fact that currencies have been volatile for years, creating an attitude that what goes down will bounce back. But this move may be more significant, with the drop coming despite a world crisis of the type that used to send flight capital to the safety of the United States. Now, that money seems to be more comfortable in Germany, or even in Japan, the scene of the greatest financial market carnage in 1990.
The message may be that the fiscal irresponsibility of the United States finally has scared investors around the world. The Government in the 80's served as the guarantor of debts for everything from trade school students to real estate promoters. Now, as those guarantees are called, the suspicion is that the Government may end up with little choice but to print more and more dollars to meet its obligations.
For foreign investors, the meaning is that asset values in this country are falling even faster than they appear to be from an American perspective. The Dow's fall of 112.62 points last week, to 2,398.02, was a 4.5 percent drop in dollars, but a 6.0 percent plunge in marks. By either measure, it was the market's worst week in a year. Falling asset values smack of deflation, but a collapsing currency would bring hyperinflation. The two results can occur simultaneously, as third world residents know. In local currencies, asset prices there are far higher than they ever were in the 70's. But in terms of hard currencies, those assets have fallen sharply.
Had Brazil been allowed to borrow cruzeiros instead of dollars in the 70's, there would be no anxious bankers now worrying about debt restructuring talks. They would already have suffered, as Brazil repaid its loans with a devalued currency. It is possible that, in the end, that is what the United States will do.
In Washington, the fears are of recession and of voters who will retaliate if asked to pay taxes to support cherished entitlements. Despite the dollar's woes, there is heavy pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.
Harry S. Truman used to say ''the buck stops here.'' But with George Bush seeming to have no idea what he wants to do about the deficit, other than to find someone else to blame, chances are that the buck's decline will not stop here.

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds;
What Investors Want to Know

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
The bear market, the looming recession and the crisis in the Persian Gulf have made everyone jumpy. Investors in mutual funds are showing their anxiety by monitoring their accounts more closely than usual: Telephone calls from investors surged in August and are still coming in at higher-than-normal levels at many funds, marketers at many large fund groups say. What follows is a sampling of the most commonly asked questions and an amalgam of answers from fund managers, economists and other experts.
Question: With the Middle East in turmoil and a recession near, what's going to happen in the financial markets? 
Answer: Nobody knows, of course, because nobody knows whether a war will, in fact, break out. Nor does anyone know just how long - or how deep - a recession might be. But clearly, economic turbulence and uncertainty are not the stuff of market rallies, and one thing seems quite certain: The high-flying investment returns of the roaring 1980's are long gone.
Q. What will happen to my funds if war does break out?
A. Government bond prices might dip in response to inflation fears and then rebound strongly as investors make a headlong stampede to quality, says C. Frazier Evans, senior economist with the Boston-based Colonial Group. He says tax-exempt bond funds stand to benefit because governments usually finance wars by raising taxes, and higher taxes make tax-free income more valuable.
As for stock funds, a war could create ''bargain prices that might not be seen again for a generation,'' said A. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services in Summit, N.J. An extended conflict would also push up levels of spending in science and technology. Other likely beneficiaries: energy and natural resource funds.
Q. What's the best place to invest now?
A. Given the uncertainty, diversifying your investments makes more sense than usual. Today, many people have a large chunk of their portfolios in stock funds because stocks performed so well in the last decade, said Cornelia M. Small, director of research for the Scudder Group. But you may want to realign the balance among stock, bond and money-market funds. Adding foreign investments to the mix - but cautiously - also helps reduce risk.
One caveat: Even if your fund group does not assess a fee for switching money among funds, any switch that you make is treated as a sale for tax purposes.
Looking ahead, keep in mind that when the economy slumps, the weakest companies are hit hardest. Quality concerns are already reflected in bond funds, where the yield spread between government and ''junk bond'' funds widened in August.
Q. So should I move out of stock funds?
A. Despite the value of diversification, don't overreact. It doesn't make sense to bail out when prices are so low, and if you have made investments to meet long-term goals, stick by them. You may even want to add shares in stock funds to take advantage of price declines. This is a good time, experts say, to begin dollar-cost averaging - investing set amounts over regular intervals to bring down the average cost of the investment.
Q. What are the fund managers doing to minimize my losses?
A. Some managers are reducing their market exposure by building up large cash reserves. James Craig, who manages the Janus Fund, now has about three-quarters of his fund's assets in cash. Others have to remain invested according to fund bylaws. Vanguard, for example, keeps 90 percent of its assets in stocks. Fund managers should be able to tell you their current cash levels. And some funds, under their bylaws, can use options and futures to protect against falling markets. Check your fund's prospectus.
Q. Should I buy gold funds?
A. The runup in gold prices that began when Iraq invaded Kuwait is already over. But investments in gold traditionally are viewed as good hedges in times of economic and political instability. Nonetheless, gold is an extremely volatile investment. Most investors probably should keep no more than 5 percent of their portfolios in gold.
Q. Why has the price of my government bond fund shifted so much recently?
A. Remember, the ''government guarantee'' on these bonds means the principal is guaranteed when the bonds mature. But interim fluctuations can send the price all over the map. The threat of inflation pushed down bond prices in August, for example, but they stabilized last month. For long-term investors, the interim price fluctuations are unimportant. If you only bought your shares recently, it may pay to wait to sell them.
 
CLOSED-END FUNDS IN SYNC, AGAIN
As a group, closed-end stock funds followed the market downward in the third quarter, losing 14.59 percent against a 14.86 percent drop in the Dow Jones industrial average. Prices for closed-end funds, which trade on listed exchanges like stock, are set by supply and demand and fund shares trade at a premium or discount to the value of the stocks in their portfolios.
Third-quarter performance was a change from the first half. Discounts on closed-end stock funds widened through the first half, meaning that share prices of closed-end funds did not keep pace with the value of the stocks in their portfolios. And the Herzfeld average, which tracks closed-end funds, lagged the Dow by an average of two percentage points through June. Discounts began to shrink in the third quarter, and the funds did a bit better than the market. ''Investors had a strong level of comfort in this group and didn't panic during the market rout,'' said Thomas J. Herzfeld, who specializes in closed-end funds.

HEADLINE: The Pedestrian Sneaker Makes a Comeback

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
They are advertisements with a wink. A playful young mother lies on her back and balances her giggling tot on her ankles and feet, which are clad in plain white canvas sneakers. The caption: ''Keds introduces weightlifting shoes.''
Barbara A. Scott, marketing vice president for Keds, says the intended message is ''you don't have to sweat your brains out to wear our shoes.''
That no-sweat marketing approach by Keds in its new television and print ads is a deliberate contrast to the frenetic athletes and dancers prancing through the typical sneakers commercial. So far, it has helped Keds capitalize on what many industry analysts say is a fundamental change in consumer preferences for casual footwear. Consumers seem to be moving back toward the mostly simple designs of sneakers that are Keds's staples. The shift is already hurting brands like L.A. Gear, whose sales of expensive shoes in elaborate designs and unusual color combinations have plummeted. 
Except for Nike Inc., the industry leader, most footwear companies have seen sales of their most expensive shoes drop off, while the less expensive, and therefore less profitable, brands continue to sell well. Largely because of this trend, Salomon Brothers estimates that 1990 industry sales, in terms of dollars, will grow 10 percent, compared with nearly 30 percent as recently as 1988.
There is much uncertainty in this part of the footwear industry. A lot of it stems from the fact that the companies are really more marketers than manufacturers. Many of the major companies get their shoes from the same factories in Taiwan and South Korea.
''Shoes are all basically the same,'' said David Lubars, whose Leonard Monahan Lubars & Partners advertising agency developed the campaign for Keds. ''What you try to build is an image of what's cool and who wears the shoe.''
Owned by the Stride Rite Corporation of Cambridge, Mass., Keds has become the country's fourth-largest brand, overtaking Converse Inc., analysts say. Keds's casual footwear is not really in the same league as the brawny athletic shoes made by Nike and Reebok, or L.A. Gear's fashion sneakers. But analysts note that 80 percent or more of athletic shoes never go near a basketball or tennis court, anyway. Instead they wind up as street shoes worn around the house or out to the mall and movies.
Until recent months, Keds seemed to be out of favor. Sales had slowed so much that Stride Rite announced last December that it expected revenue to grow by just 10 percent in 1990. Stride Rite's stock plunged on the news, prompting a hostile takeover bid by Walsh Greenwood & Co., the Greenwich, Conn., investment concern, which Stride Rite successfully resisted.
Sales have rebounded since then and analysts are now projecting Keds's growth rate will top 20 percent, or double that of the industry, to $270 million in sales this year. Once known mainly as a children's brand, Keds have had especially strong appeal since the late 1980's to working mothers and professional women, who often buy several pairs. At about $20, these canvas sneakers cost a third of the average leather-bound Reeboks or Nikes, which average $60 or more.
Sales are sluggish or declining in much of the $5.3 billion athletic footwear industry, but analysts say Keds could still flourish in an economic recession because of their low price.
Hardest hit among the major companies has been L.A. Gear, the California-based company whose expensive fashionable shoes appeal mainly to young women. Earlier this summer, L.A. Gear announced a sharp drop in net income for the second quarter. Company officials cited reluctance by recession-conscious retailers to stock expensive footwear and sales volume moving toward cheaper L.A. Gear shoes. L.A. Gear's stock plummeted 22 percent. Recently, the company said the third-quarter net would also be down.
Nike continues to prosper using a powerful advertising campaign that features the multiathletic talents of Bo Jackson. With projected 1990 sales of more than $1.5 billion, Nike may post sales growth of 30 percent this year, coming on top of a 20 percent rise last year.
But even Nike's latest results disappointed investors accustomed to runaway growth. When Nike reported last month a first-quarter earnings rise of 31 percent, to $99.7 million, and a 38 percent gain in revenues, to $833.6 million, its stock fell. Nike closed Friday at $30, up $2 a share, in over-the-counter trading.
Reebok, at No. 2 with $1.3 billion in projected 1990 sales, said recently that it expects a third-quarter drop in profits and a flat year for earnings. Converse, Avia and Adidas are expected to show sales declines, analysts say. Most footwear stocks are trading near their 52-week lows.
''In the last six months, there has been a dramatic shift from fashion-oriented shoes back to basics,'' said Heidi R. Steinberg, a footwear analyst with Salomon Brothers. ''People don't want a lot of doodads anymore.''
Steven B. Frankel, an analyst with Adams, Harkness & Hill in Boston, noted that Keds, lacking high profile endorsements by expensive celebrity athletes or rock stars, was in a good marketing position.
''Keds are not in as fickle a market as L.A. Gear,'' Mr. Frankel said. ''They don't need Michael Jackson. They don't need Bo Jackson. They are getting Mrs. Jackson from 1234 Anywhere Street, U.S.A.'' Reebok, for one, disagrees. Unlike most footwear companies, Reebok has managed to market its athletic shoes well to men and women, and says it is too early to tell if there has been a fundamental change.
''There's a lot of shifting back and forth going on out there,'' said David C. House, vice president for sales for the Reebok brand. ''Where it stops nobody knows.'' But like other footwear companies, Reebok is seeing an increase in the sales of its less expensive models.
Keds practically invented the sneaker. Around the turn of the century, shoemakers were gluing melted, or ''vulcanized,'' rubber onto canvas tops. In 1917, the U.S. Rubber company introduced Keds, the first popularly marketed sneaker, so nicknamed because the wearer's footsteps were so quiet.
The brand was originally named Peds, Latin for foot, but another company already had registered the name. So Keds, with its evocation of kids, was chosen instead. The first Keds had black soles and chestnut brown canvas tops.
Sneakers changed little until the 70's and early 80's, when nouveau sports like jogging and aerobics gained in popularity. Phil Knight, a runner at the University of Oregon, and his coach, Bill Bowerman, invented Nikes, named after the Greek goddess of victory, because they wanted shoes that were lighter and had better traction than the available tennis and basketball shoes. In the 80's, Reeboks, named after a swift African mammal resembling a gazelle, became popular mainly with women seeking comfortable shoes for aerobic exercises.
As those changes swept by, Keds's sales started sinking. The company tried to compete with a shoe called Pro-Keds, but sales were lackluster. ''Keds was left in the dust,'' said Ms. Scott, Keds's marketing vice president.
But the company noticed that its shoes had become fashionable among some young women who wanted simple sneakers. The shoes gained cachet from photos and mentions in fashion magazines showing them as complements to white pants and khaki shorts. They were also popular in places like beach towns in Southern California and the Soho district of Manhattan, possibly because they were inexpensive and were perhaps considered an ''anti-fashion'' fashion statement.
To expand the shoes' appeal more to young professional women, Keds in 1988 hired a small advertising agency in Providence, R.I., to develop a new approach.
The agency, Leonard Monahan Lubars, conducted interviews with consumers, known as focus groups, and asked them oddball questions like ''If Keds were a building, what kind of building would it be?'' One frequent answer: A country house with a white picket fence around it. Nike, by contrast, was often described as a glass-and-steel skyscraper. Those reactions ''told us a lot of things,'' said Mr. Lubars, executive vice president and creative director. ''It told us 'anti-athletic' might work.'' With a modest budget, it also meant the company would not need to hire expensive athletic stars to hawk the product.
Keds and the ad agency also came up with a new slogan: ''Keds. They Feel Good,'' that they hoped would attract young professionals while still evoking kid appeal. The television ads have the lighthearted approach of the print ads. One TV ad shows a couple playfully arguing. The woman throws a Keds shoe at the man. The tag line is, ''Introducing Keds debating shoes.''
Keds also expanded the product line. The shoes now come in about 20 styles and more than half a dozen colors. The basic design of a simple canvas top remained, however.
Since starting its new campaign, or what marketers call repositioning, Keds sales have boomed. Sales to retailers nearly quadrupled, to $227 million in 1989 from $60 million in 1986. Keds also grew from a quarter of Stride Rite's sales in 1986 to half in 1989.
Following its success with female customers, the next step for Keds is to get more men to buy the shoes, said Ms. Scott. Future ad campaigns will highlight Keds in a more masculine style.

HEADLINE: In Hollywood, Big Just Gets Bigger

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
The growing foreign investment in the American entertainment industry, far from being a challenge to this country's longstanding dominance of the business, reflects a worldwide belief that only Hollywood can meet the rapidly expanding global demand for films, television shows and recorded music.
That is the view of industry executives and analysts, who point to the possible acquisition of MCA Inc., the parent of Universal Studios and MCA Records, by the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company, Japan's largest electronics company, as the latest example of the trend.
Even as they attract foreign investors, Hollywood studios and other American entertainment concerns have expanded their output and consolidated into a relative handful of huge communications companies. They have been motivated largely by the belief that sheer size and financial clout will be essential to compete in making and distributing entertainment products both in the United States and abroad.
The result has been a transformation of the American entertainment industry. Over the last five years it has developed an international base of financing and ownership while companies have diversified into all aspects of the business, ranging from cable networks, television stations and movie theaters to videocassette recorders and satellites, all fed by Hollywood's unrivaled, if uneven, creative talents. 
''What Saudi Arabia is to oil, the United States is to entertainment,'' said Raymond Katz, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton, a subsidiary of American Express.
It remains unclear how extensively the changes that have swept the industry will influence the content or style of movies, television shows and recordings. It is also an open question whether bigger will prove to be better among entertainment companies, in creative terms or on the bottom line.
There is no question, however, that the industry has been altered permanently. If MCA is acquired by Matsushita and a pending deal for the MGM/UA Communications Corporation by an Italian investor, Giancarlo Parretti, is completed, five of the seven major studios will have been sold or merged into larger companies in the last five years. Four of the new owners will have come from abroad. At the same time, the number of smaller companies in the business has fallen dramatically as the Weintraub Entertainment Group, the De Laurentiis Entertainment Group and a host of others have collapsed, unable to weather a string of box-office flops or to compete with larger, better-financed rivals.
Moreover, film and television production has become just one element in a broader approach to the business. After long seeing broadcast and cable television and home video as competitors, studios have rushed into those fields. Many industry executives think it is only a matter of time before studios and the television networks begin merging.
Similarly, the Japanese makers of electronic ''hardware'' like videocassette recorders have plunged into the making of movies, television shows, music and other ''software,'' as demonstrated by Matsushita's interest in MCA and the Sony Corporation's acquisition in recent years of Columbia Pictures and CBS Records.
''IT'S been a period of the most dramatic change in the history of the industry,'' said Alan J. Hirschfield, a former head of Columbia Pictures and Twentieth Century Fox who is now a managing director at the investment firm of Wertheim Schroder & Company. ''It's a totally different business from what it was five years ago.''
The changes are being driven to a large degree by the rapid increase in demand for entertainment product around the world. Movies now routinely make more money abroad than in the United States.
The deregulation of broadcasting in Europe has created a host of new channels in many countries and a corresponding need to fill more hours of air time, often with American-made programming. New markets are developing in Eastern Europe, China and elsewhere that are now permitting greater access to films, television and music.
The effect of the changes on films, television programs and recordings in the United States is difficult to gauge. There is a general consensus in the industry that foreign ownership has so far not had a discernible impact on content or on the types of films and programs being made.
Foreign owners and investors, most notably Sony, have left the day-to-day operations in the hands of American executives. The success of movies and television shows still depends primarily on appealing to audiences in the United States, which remains the single largest and most influential market for entertainment.
Still, some industry executives believe the new owners, particularly the Japanese, may in the long run exert a cultural influence, however benign.
Because the interest of Sony and Matsushita in Hollywood stems from how movies and other programming can complement their electronics businesses, some executives say, they may ultimately apply different definitions of economic success to movie and television projects from those used by the industry today, favoring, for example, films that play well on videocassette over movies that are best seen in a theater on a big screen.
Moreover, many people in the industry think foreign owners are likely to become more assertive in imposing their own cultural perspectives and business decisions as they gain experience and seek to recoup their large investments.
''In the short run it may be subtle or not very noticeable, but in the long run you have to believe it will have an impact,'' Mr. Hirschfield said.
IN addition to the outright acquisitions by companies like Sony, the lines between foreign and domestic companies have been greatly blurred by less-publicized deals and joint ventures:
* Carolco Pictures, the maker of the Rambo movies, earlier this year sold a 10 percent stake to Pioneer Electronics of Japan and a 5 percent stake to Canal Plus, the leading pay-television network in France.
* Michael Douglas's production company, Stonebridge Entertainment, is making television movies with financial backing from RAI-2, an Italian network.
* Paramount Pictures has set up a division in London to make movies with European writers, directors and actors.
* The Walt Disney Company just agreed to finance many of its films with money put up by Japanese investors.
Within the United States, most of the studios have purchased television stations and theater chains. The Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation has built a fourth broadcast network. The merger of Time Inc. and Warner Communications Inc. last year created a company that is at once among the largest owners of cable systems and networks, the largest producer of network television programming, one of Hollywood's most consistently successful film studios and one of the world's biggest recording companies. The big entertainment conglomerates, MCA among them, have been snapping up recording companies, leaving no major independent music labels.
THERE is likely to be more action ahead. Paramount Communications Inc., the parent of Paramount Pictures and one of the two major entertainment companies not to change ownership in recent years, is openly scouting for major acquisitions and has talked to everyone from MCA to an Australian television network. The Walt Disney Company, the other studio not to have been sold or merged, is widely rumored to be interested in acquiring CBS Inc. if Federal rules limiting the ability of networks and studios to own each other are eased, as many in Hollywood expect.
''What you will end up with is a few multinational communications conglomerates that are vertically integrated to the extent allowed by the laws of the various countries they operate in,'' said David I. Weil, an entertainment lawyer who handles many international clients for the firm of O'Melveny & Myers in Los Angeles.
Both Wall Street and industry executives are still waiting to see whether the consolidation pays off. The Time-Warner merger last year brought together a formidable array of businesses, including Time's HBO cable network and the Warner Brothers studio, but the combined company's heavy debt load and lackluster earnings have so far been a disappointment on Wall Street.
And Sony spent $2 billion several years ago to acquire CBS Records and another $3.5 billion applying the same concept to the video field with the purchase of Columbia Pictures.
Although it is still early in the process, industry executives say the Columbia deal so far has proven little except that the attempt to reinvigorate the studio is costing Sony hundreds of millions of dollars in additional and unexpected investment to fund film production and hire a new team of executives.
 
WILL IT PLAY IN PESHAWAR?
TThe surge of foreign ownership in the entertainment industry has had a negligible impact so far on the content of entertainment from Hollywood.
But the growing need to appeal to an international audience has made some difference.
Studios have started choosing what movies to make and who should star in them with an eye to how well they will play abroad.
Movies starring actors with worldwide appeal like Arnold Schwarzenegger are almost certain to get a go-ahead.
''Shirley Valentine,'' a film about a middle-aged English housewife, would probably never have been made if Paramount Pictures had to rely solely on its reception in the United States.
But the studio went ahead because of its confidence in its performance abroad.
The consolidation of the industry is also having an effect on what types of films get made. The studios, which need to support a large amount of overhead and worldwide distribution systems, are concentrating almost exclusively on medium and big budgets.
There is less appetite than everfor low-budget films, and because there are few remaining independent production companies, writers and directors say there is little opportunity to make films that do not have an obvious appeal to a mass audience.

HEADLINE: It's a Bear All Right, but How Big a Bear?

BYLINE: By JOEL KURTZMAN

 BODY:
Since shortly before Saddam Hussein invaded Iraq, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen about 600 points - from a high of nearly 3000, to the 2400 range. By any standard, such a bruising tumble can only result from a brush with the bear. But how long will the bear market stalk Wall Street? How far will the Dow fall? And will there be safe havens in such a market?
To find out, Joel Kurtzman of the New York Times asked Charles I. Clough Jr., chief investment strategist of Merrill Lynch & Company and a first vice president of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets; Eric H. Sorensen, director of quantitative analysis and co-manager of equity portfolio analysis at Salomon Brothers Inc., and Lewis J. Sperber, founder and president of Sperber Adams & Company Inc., a brokerage firm in Westport, Conn., about their expectations for the stock market for the coming year.
Q. Are we in a bear market? 
Mr. Sorensen: Yes. This market has a lot to do with the perception of deteriorating fundamentals in the United States. Earnings are a key factor here and so is psychology. I expect the market to go another 10 or 20 percent lower.
Mr. Clough: I agree, Eric. This is the first recession we've seen that has been led by the financial sector. Bank balance sheets are still under pressure. What this says is that the normal postwar recession patterns may not be quite so relevant now. We could be be looking at lows that go beyond the normal recession levels in the credit-sensitive sectors of the economy.
Mr. Sperber: I don't think that we have seen the bottom of either the market or the recession. We have another couple of years to go. I'm talking 1991 on the downside, probably starting to come out of it in 1992. We have further to go on the downside in the equities markets. We're not at the bottom yet.
Q. What are you advising your clients to do?
Mr. Sorensen: From a traditional standpoint, where our clients actively manage equity portfolios, they don't have the range of alternatives that some other investors have. A pension fund can move into cash but an active manager who is asked to basically be 100 percent invested cannot.
In lieu of that, clearly there's a rotation going on. And the rotation within the equity market is not for value right now, it is to reduce risk.
I don't think we'll see any sustainable uptrend in this market until there's a rotation into return-oriented investing where people are trying to buy groups of stocks because those stocks have earnings momentum. That'll happen some day but we're a ways from there still.
Given that, we have the utility sector which we all probably have some sympathy for because it is defensive. We've got telephones, we've got drugs, health care and foods. These things looked overbought about a month or two ago - particularly the health sector - but they'll probably go higher on a relative basis as long as we're in this environment. Energy stocks had an overvalued, overbought temporary situation as a result of the Middle East crisis. They have since sold off a little bit. That's a place where I'd begin to build in this bear market.
Mr. Clough: The greatest challenge for investment in the 1990's is secure yield. The actual number of instruments out there - where an investor can be certain of getting high current income for an extended period of time - is shrinking dramatically.
There have been three traditional yield-paying groups: banks and the financial stocks, automobiles and utilities. The first two groups are under stress. That puts you back into utilities as the one area where yield is reasonably assured.
On the fixed-income side, the current situation keeps you very much wedded to the Treasury sector.
Mr. Sperber: You asked what we're telling investors. But the opposite question is also important, namely, what are the investors telling us?
On the retail side, individuals are leaning more towards bonds and fixed-income investments. They say they want secure return. They want safe return, whether it's the Treasury or corporate bond. The individual investor is not running to invest money in equities. Those who want to go into equities are leaning more toward the mutual funds than they did before.
Mr. Clough: That's interesting. The most popular security held today by Merrill Lynch investors is the 90-day certificate of deposit.
Mr. Sperber: I am finding that the individual investor in the equities market is someone who has been an investor for a longer period of time. They are not the peoplewho came in and tried to play in the marketplace in the late 1980's just prior to the crash of October 1987 and then got burned. They are people who were investing in the 1970's and during the 1980's. They are people who know that the market goes through cycles. These investors are willing to buy selected equities at the present time.
Q. And what are you telling them?
Mr. Sperber: We've been advising them to buy securities and sell options against them. It is a time-honored technique and the investor of today is more cautious and seasoned than the investor of, say, five years ago. The investor of today is saying that if there is an upside rally, he or she is willing to limit the upside gain because he's already sold that call.
Q. Should investors wait for the bottom of the market to buy?
Mr. Sperber: My answer is this: You're never going to find the bottom and you're never going to find the top of the market.
Mr. Clough: Yeah, but it's fun trying.
Mr. Sperber: If the world really is gloomy, what do you do right now? I would say you could buy equities. Yes, you don't know where the bottom is going to be, but you do know that by 1993, 1994 or 1995, we'll be going to go through another cycle when things will be better. For individual investors, that means they can buy equities as long-term investments. For the institutional investors, the next couple of years will probably be more of a trading market.
Q. Are any of the markets' problems due to factors like the budget deficit, the ''junk bond'' crisis and the economy's tip toward recession?
Mr. Sorensen: Absolutely. There are a number of areas of deterioration defining this bear market and you just mentioned three of them. But you've also got global forces. We have American interest rates, given inflation here compared with inflation in Japan and inflation in Europe, no longer competitive relative to the German bond and the Japanese bond. Most - but not all -of the global investors I talk to are fairly pessimistic about our currency and about our economic environment. That's not a positive right now for stocks.
Mr. Clough: We are looking at the lowest rate of growth in credit since 1985. Public sector deficits are rising - that's quite visible, and certainly discounted in the marketplace. But private credit is falling at almost an unprecedented rate - mortgage originations are practically disappearing. We have the lowest short-term interest rates in the world right now, and have had for several months.
Q. Aren't low interest rates traditionally associated with bull markets?
Mr. Clough: Yes and no -it depends on what they are reflecting. If it's reflecting an expansion of liquidity on the part of the Federal Reserve system, yes, that would be bullish. But if it's reflecting a runoff of credit, and a credit collapse and a decline in bank deposits, it might have quite different implications. That's the real question for investors right now.
Q. Are there other groups of stocks that look pomising?
Mr. Clough: Well, some of the machinery groups - trucking and related stocks - are pretty depressed. We're not at a point where we see an upmove in those stocks yet, but we're getting there.
Mr. Sorensen: I agree with Chuck. Truckers have performed relatively well, at least a few of them, the last week or two, and the outlook for their earnings has stabilized. I don't know whether that will the case a month from now. They are presumably somewhat volatile, with the economy the way it is. There are other areas, too, like technology. But that doesn't mean they'll go up right away.
Mr. Sperber: You can't take every security that's out there by group. We might all agree that retailing has been in decline. But if you believe that the consumer is still going to spend at least some money, why not look at retailers who are going to fill that need, like The Limited, or Gap stores? They will fulfill the consumer's need in a down economy.
Mr. Clough: I happen to believe that the group decision is a very important one right now. It has been more so in recent times than, say, in periods of bull markets or periods of stable markets.
Mr. Sperber: Even in a recession, Mr. and Mrs. Jones are still going to take their families out to dinner. They may not go to a fancy restaurant, so McDonald's is going to become the beneficiary of that fact. At these price levels, you buy McDonald's - not for three months, but for a two- to three-year period of time. The public doesn't give up drinking beer during a recession.
Banks' balance sheets are eroding, but at these price levels I think you could buy a Chase or a Chemical or a Citibank. I don't believe that Chase or Chemical or Citibank is going out of business. If I'm a long-term investor and Chase is selling at $12, or even goes down to $7.50 or $8, I will buy it and keep it over a three-year or five-year period of time until it recovers.
Q. Where do you forecast the Dow will be in 12 months?
Mr. Sperber: I see the Dow going down as low as the 2200 range within the next 12 months.
Mr. Clough: Our guess is that a bottom is somewhere out there perhaps in the second quarter of 1991. If valuation parameters that have been relevant in the last 10 or 20 years still matter, the low will probably be in the 2000 to 2200 range. You might get a spike below that.
Mr. Sorensen: There will be some rallies, but the Dow will work its way down to the 2000, 2100, 2200 - that range. Those are buying opportunities, given the way the world looks now.
Mr. Clough: Let me have one last comment. If any of us could really predict where the Dow is going, we'd be calling our brokers from our yacht.

HEADLINE: Tense Talks at Chrysler

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
Claiming the company has no money to meet union wage demands is a time-honored tactic of collective bargaining. But this time there seems to be little doubt that Chrysler Corporation management is telling autoworkers the truth about its precarious position.
If Chrysler agreed to a labor contract such as the one approved in recent weeks by General Motors Corporation workers and Ford Motor Company negotiators, the company says its labor costs would rise significantly at a time when it already has the highest labor costs in the industry. Chrysler and the United Automobile Workers union began high-level bargaining last week.
With sales and profit flagging, the No. 3 auto maker is struggling to conserve financial resources for the next two years until it can bring out a crucial new midsize car, which it hopes will put sales back on track. (Truck sales may get a boost from a recently introduced new minivan and a new Jeep slated for next year.) But the Persian Gulf crisis and the possibility of a deep recession have raised the likelihood that Chrysler's finances will be stretched more than anticipated in July, when it first told the U.A.W. to consider accepting a less expensive contract. 
While labor costs alone won't drive Chrysler to the brink ''they will have been a nail in Chrysler's coffin if the company dies,'' said Ronald Glantz, analyst for the Dean Witter Reynolds Organization in San Francisco. Analysts generally believe Chrysler has a good chance to survive, but agree with the company's own assessment that it must find a partner to share the enormous cost of developing new models. An expensive labor contract may make Chrysler less attractive to a potential partner, Mr. Glantz says.
He thinks Chrysler is close, however, to a broad development, production and distribution agreement with Fiat S.p.A., but may be waiting to conclude a labor contract before signing the pact.
Lee A. Iacocca, the chairman of Chrysler, after leaving what he called ''a nice lively session'' with union bargainers, declined Thursday to reveal precisely what he had said. ''I did not plead poverty,'' he told reporters. But a Chrysler spokesman who had seen an outline of Mr. Iacocca's speech said ''he was going to tell them it will be nice if a contract says they're supposed to be making a lot of money three years from now, but a contract won't help anyone if we're not in business.''
For the record, the union wouldn't talk about the session either. Privately, however, union officials are far from sympathetic to Chrysler's problems, which they acknowledge are real. They believe that hourly workers have sacrificed disproportionately in the decade since Chrysler nearly went bankrupt. All 11 union negotiators who came to the meeting with Mr. Iacocca were wearing buttons that read ''Pattern or Picket.'' According to the union's tradition of so-called pattern bargaining, a contract reached with one of the Big Three domestic auto makers is used as the pattern for the other two.
There have been exceptions. In the early 80's Chrysler workers agreed to broad wage and benefit concessions to help the company recover from near-bankruptcy. By the mid-80's the company had regained its health, and workers regained wage parity with those at other companies.
For the past year, however, Chrysler's fortunes have dimmed again in the face of fierce competition and a softening automotive market. If they were to accept lower pay and benefits, Chrysler workers contend, they would be accepting the blame for management ineptitude. Mr. Iacocca, who concedes he made some strategic blunders, meanwhile is trying to cut $2.5 billion in costs, quickly develop new products and stem an exodus of executives.
In a recent published interview, Mr. Iacocca accepted blame for diversifying into the aerospace and defense business, a move that diverted attention and money from producing cars and trucks. And he admitted he was mistaken in joining forces with Maserati to build a luxury coupe and in moving production of the Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon from one plant to another shortly before canceling them altogether.
Although Chrysler workers receive roughly the same pay and benefits as union workers at Ford and G.M., Chrysler's labor costs are higher because it has a proportionately higher number of retirees. In 1989 Chrysler's labor costs were $33.16 an hour, compared with $29.50 an hour at G.M. and $30.98 at Ford. Because Chrysler has a higher proportion of retirees, its hourly labor cost also would be inflated more than that of its domestic rivals by a provision approved at Ford and G.M. that raises a typical monthly pension payment to $1,800 from $1,500. (United States auto plants operated by Japanese companies have lower labor costs because they have almost no retirees.) One method of lowering labor cost is boosting productivity. Chrysler's management was disappointed when workers in St. Louis turned down a proposal for a three-shift operation that would have boosted minivan production. The union accepted the concept, but the sides couldn't agree on overtime pay. Chrysler says that shows an ''attitude problem.''
The union rejects that view, noting that Mr. Iacocca, citing ''brain drain,'' reinstituted stock bonuses for executives earlier this year shortly after announcing that executive bonuses had been canceled to save money.
''When it comes to workers they want a good attitude, when it comes to executives I don't hear Iacocca denouncing Jerry Greenwald for leaving the company to work on the United Airlines deal,'' said a union member who spoke on condition of anonymity. Mr. Greenwald, who was Mr. Iacocca's heir apparent, resigned as vice chairman to lead the group attempting a leveraged buyout of U.A.L. Inc.
Union leaders also are vexed that Chrysler made a public issue of breaking away from G.M. and Ford. Had the company consulted privately with the union, they say, they might have been able to find ways of reducing labor costs without angering the rank-and-file.
Chrysler executives and managers, meanwhile, believe they've also sacrificed plenty in pay and perks. A spokesman said merit increases have been frozen for six months; memberships, travel and subscriptions have been cut back; and the stock bonuses won't be paid until next year. Over the past three years, the cutback of salaried workers has been deeper than that of U.A.W. workers. Chrysler's salaried work force has dropped 25 percent to 27,000 from 36,000, while the union work force has dropped to 63,000 from 70,000 - only 10 percent.
Because Chrysler's financial position is not nearly as desperate as it was in the early 80's, management may have trouble convincing the union to moderate wage and benefit demands. As of three months ago the company had more than $4 billion in cash and marketable securities and several assets, such as financial service subsidiaries, that the company believes could easily be sold in an emergency.
Moreover, the amount of money that would be saved by union concessions probably isn't big enough to decide Chrysler's fate. The hourly-labor component of the total cost of making a car has continued to decline as manufacturing methods improve.
In this atmosphere, if union negotiators agreed to a smaller wage increase than the 3 percent promised at Ford and G.M., or to a lower increase for pensioners, Chrysler workers might fail to ratify the contract, raising the likelihood of a strike.
Chrysler executives aren't certain whether sales will rebound, whether its new car, minivan and Jeep will be big hits, and whether a few hundred million dollars saved in labor costs may be the difference that forestalls another request for government help. A strike, on the other hand, would be extremely costly at a time when Chrysler's redesigned 1991 minivan is just starting to be produced and is in very short supply.
In 1980 Mr. Iacocca cut his own salary to $1 a year to dramatize the seriousness of Chrysler's plight. He's now employed under a multimillion dollar management contract, whose value has diminished because of the fall in Chrysler's stock price. But at this point he and others in top management might have to accept an even bigger pay cut to persuade the U.A.W. to do the same.
 
CHRYSLER-FIAT MARRIAGE?
Once Chrysler has a new labor agreement and knows what labor costs will be, it may be in better position to agree to a partnership that many believe the company is negotiating with Fiat S.p.A.
Bud Liebler, Chrysler's vice president of communications, says Fiat and Chrysler are talking about a broad range of possible cooperation.
Chrysler might sell minivans and Jeeps in Europe through Fiat dealers, vastly reducing costs. Fiat would like to get back into the American market and thinks Chrysler might build a version of its Tipo small car.
Ron Glantz of the Dean Witter Organization in San Francisco says sources at Chrysler and Fiat tell him Fiat may want to build Chrysler's downsized Jeep in South America or Poland. Chrysler's plan to build the Jeep with Renault fell through.
Another possibility, said Mr. Glantz, is that Fiat will accept Chrysler's airbag and emission control technology as payment for what it provides to the partnership. European luxury cars soon will be putting these features in their cars, forcing Fiat's Alfa-Romeo and Lancia models to follow suit.

THE ECONOMY
 
After a Week of Negotiations, the Budget Gap Narrows
 
After topsy-turvy budget negotiations all week, Congress and the White House narrowed their differences. Higher gasoline taxes seem inevitable; lower capital gains tax and steeper tax rates for the rich, improbable. Another truth emerged: The cost of financing the deficit will balloon before the Government can meet its debt-reduction goal of $500 billion. Foreign investors were eerily absent at last week's record $8.5 billion auction of seven-year Treasury notes - a void that drove up yields to their highest level since an auction in April 1989. A declining dollar and more favorable interest rates abroad have kept Japanese and European investors, who finance the bulk of the deficit, from Treasury auctions all year. But the breakdown in the budget talks completely shattered their confidence. ''We've come to expect them to buy 20 to 30 percent of these auctions,'' said Ward McCarthy of Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a research concern. ''But there was no sign of them. It's a fundamental change that has long-term implications for taxpayers and the economy.'' He expects just as poor a showing of foreign bidders at next month's quarterly auction of 30-year notes, where their absence would be even harder felt. 
 
The Cost of Crude
 
The coming cold weather, shrinking stockpiles and persistent fears about war in the Persian Gulf caused oil prices to graze $40 a barrel last week. Crude closed at $39.69 a barrel on Friday, up $1.70 for the week.
 
Looking to make points with politicians and the public, the five companies that own Alaska's giant Prudhoe Bay oilfield vowed to spend $1.1 billion on equipment to increase oil production. The new plant, which will be ready in 1995, had been in the works before the Iraqi invasion, but the partners, including British Petroleum and ARCO, said they thought it could ''make a welcome contribution'' to allaying concerns about America's long-term oil supplies. Yet the new equipment will actually only slow a steady decline rather than increase Prudhoe production, which now stands at about 1.4 million barrels a day. The new investment should compensate for only 100,000 barrels of oil a day of an expected decline in production of 400,000 barrels by 1995.
 
Oil's Pervasive Impact
 
The across-the-board jump in wholesale prices for September provides the first compelling evidence that the record-breaking energy-price climb has shot through the economy. Wholesale prices jumped by 1.6 percent, which, together with August's sharp increase of 1.3 percent, represents the steepest two-month gain since 1980, the Labor Department said. What startled economists was how quickly the oil runup has translated into higher prices for everything from pharmaceuticals to trucks. The outbreak of inflation probably kills the Federal Reserve's commitment to ease interest rates if Congress makes budget cuts. ''Inflation is a much more intractable problem than the Fed had thought,'' said William V. Sullivan, a senior vice president at Dean Witter. ''The report will send it back to the drawing board.''
 
New Business Starts Off by 3.1%
 In the contracting economy, entrepreneurs could use a transfusion like the one provided under the rejected Federal budget pact, which called for incentives to investors in small companies. After rising through most of the 80's, new business incorporations dropped 3.1 percent in the first seven months of the year, after falling 1.1 percent for all of 1989, according to Dun & Bradstreet.
 
In Brief
 
A service-oriented Soviet airline? It will be called Air Russia, will begin flying from Moscow in 1992 and will be majority-owned by Aeroflot, the state-run airline, in a joint venture with British Airways, which will kick in $39 million.
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
Scandalous Japan
 
The stench of corruption lingers in Japan Inc. Hisashi Shinto, one of the country's most prominent business leaders, was convicted last week of accepting bribes in the first big court case from the Recruit episode, the stock and influence-peddling scandal that forced the resignation last year of several politicians, including former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita. Mr. Shinto, the former chairman of Nippon Telephone and Telegraph, the world's largest company, appears to have been a scapegoat for political leaders who were looking to prevent further disgrace to the ruling party. But, save for self-respect, Mr. Shinto will sacrifice little: He was fined $170,000 and sentenced to two years in prison - a punishment that was suspended because of his age - 80 - and his ''contribution to the business world.'' Michael Milken should be so lucky.
 
More shocking was the sudden resignation of Ichiro Isoda, the chairman of Sumitomo Bank, one of Japan's most aggressive and profitable banks. In keeping with the Japanese custom, Mr. Isoda said he was taking responsibility for the arrest of a branch manager who was charged last week with accepting almost $750,000 to arrange an improper loan for the corporate raider Matsuhiro Kotani, indicted for stock manipulation in August. The arrest adds Sumitomo to the list of prominent institutions, including Daiwa Securities, implicated in the manipulation scheme.
 
COMPANIES
 
Insurance on a Slide
 
Could the life insurance industry be skewered by the same sword that has done in hundreds of savings and loans? The scenario may not be as dire. Yet insurance stocks got kicked last week - continuing a three-month downward trend - after news that the Travelers Corporation was abandoning its dividend and adding more than $600 million to its reserve to cover losses. Travelers may start a trend, and some even worry that mounting losses could bankrupt dozens of insurers. Competition with other financial institutions has forced insurers to pay higher interest rates to customers, pushing them out on the same fragile limb as savings banks - taking chances on risky investments like ''junk bonds.'' Paying those high rates becomes ever-more painful as income slips with the economy. Sound familiar?
 
The Incredible Shrinking Dividend
 
 Shareholders will indeed suffer from the shaky real estate climate: Chemical Bank on Thursday said it would cut its dividend in half and reported a third-quarter loss of $43.7 million, mainly from increasing its loan-loss reserve. Chase Manhattan has already cut its dividend, becoming the biggest bank yet to lean on its shareholders. In the first nine months, 278 companies shaved their dividends. ''That's more than for any year since 1982 - a recession,'' said Arnold Kaufman of Standard and Poor's. And the march of the dividend cutters has hardly reached its peak.
 
Forestalling Foreclosures
 
Pummelled by rising mortgage defaults, lenders appear eager to forestall further foreclosures, even if it means assuming the role of property manager. Lacking the leverage that allowed Donald Trump to renegotiate lending terms, John C. Portman Jr., the Atlanta developer, did the next best thing: He gave the Equitable Life Assurance Society and Nippon Life Insurance, two mortgage holders, a controlling interest in his sprawling Peachtree Center office complex in downtown Atlanta. The several million dollars Mr. Portman expects from his new partners should help him pay off anxious creditors.
 
Kodak Ordered to Pay Polaroid
 
The Polaroid Corporation will finally collect on the patent infringement suit it won five years ago against the Eastman Kodak Company. In the largest award ever in a patent infringement suit, a Federal judge ordered Kodak on Friday to pay Polaroid $909 million in compensation for lost profits and royalties on its instant photography patent. Yet Kodak's stock may rebound, as the market had prepared for much worse, while Polaroid's shares take a dip.
 
Tumult at UAL
 
A purple rage erupted at the UAL Corporation last week. The board rebuffed for lack of financing the United Airline unions' third buyout bid, a $160-a-share offer. It was a personal defeat for Gerald Greenwald, the former vice chairman of the Chrysler Corporation hired by the unions to bring in the banks. Easing his pain: the $5 million he was paid to leave the auto company and a $4 million fee. The unions' token: The company offered to sell employees 20 percent of UAL's stock at a 15 percent discount from the market price - or roughly half the share-price they had pledged for the entire company.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 21, 1990, Sunday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
A report on the Business Diary page last Sunday referred incorrectly to the quarterly dividend at the Travelers Corporation. Travelers recently announced a cut in its dividend to 40 cents a share from 60, but did not eliminate it.

HEADLINE: Cut the Deficit, Not the Dividend

 BODY:
After years of pretending that the Federal budget deficit wasn't much of a problem, Congress is poised to plunge fanatically in the other direction, as though it had no other duty than deficit reduction. But Americans can walk and chew gum at the same time. They need to see the deficit reduced, but they also need to invest in disadvantaged children, rebuild dilapidated infrastructure and save the despoiled environment. 
The deficit reduction plan now emerging on Capitol Hill not only ignores these needs; it now contains a little-recognized provision that would make them worse. Meeting these needs is as essential to economic growth as deficit reduction. That means the budget package must be fixed.
The problem with the deficit reduction package is not its size. It would cut the deficit by about $35 billion next year, after accounting for military expenses in the Persian Gulf, and by $500 billion over five years. That's enough to make a sizable dent in the Federal deficit without threatening an already fragile economy.
The problem lies elsewhere: in a provision that would, in effect, block Congress from financing more public investment for three years. That would take Congress out of the business of making choices - its core responsibility.
The proposed budget package would for three years establish separate caps, one on military expenditures and another on domestic discretionary expenditures - everything from education to food inspections. Entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare would not have a cap, although to expand them, Congress would have to raise money by hiking taxes or cutting other programs. The upshot would be chilling. Public investments would be frozen for at least three years.
The end of the cold war warrants much larger cutbacks in the military than called for in the budget package. Yet even if Congress later comes to that conclusion, it could not use this potential peace dividend to rebuild bridges, educate children or train workers. To do so would put total discretionary spending above the cap.
The cap on discretionary domestic spending would turn deficit reduction into a mindless obsession: to spend every last cent of the peace dividend on deficit reduction, every other domestic need be damned.
What's more important: better airports or more missiles? More scientific research or lower taxes? These are difficult questions, but they need to be asked. And there's no good reason for Congress to foreclose them and forbid itself to expand precious programs as long as it is willing to pay for them.
Deficits do matter, powerfully. They siphon private savings away from corporate investment in new plant and equipment. Over time, an economy that does not invest will not grow. The remedy is to commit the Government to steady deficit reduction that will raise national saving, and investment, to prudent levels. A $500 billion hit over five years would be a prudent, indeed handsome start. Once that's achieved, even more deficit reduction is slavish, not sensible.
Congress is elected to govern. That means making hard choices, not lunging for harsh formulas. Clapping arbitrary caps on domestic programs is an unconscionable surrender.

HEADLINE: Let Arms-Sale Profits Aid Poor Countries

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The Bush Administration has chosen to sell $20 billion worth of United States arms to Saudi Arabia. No doubt, this sale will be followed by other major arms sales to states such as Israel, Egypt, Pakistan and perhaps even Syria, all of whom are supporting the United States military action against Iraq in the Persian Gulf confrontation. And if the United States economy and its arms merchants are entitled to seize the gulf crisis to make profits for themselves, can the European, Soviet and Brazilian arms industries and economies afford to remain behind? 
Meanwhile, the Iraqi invasion and annexation of Kuwait has given the remaining major oil producers windfall profits from the soaring prices of oil. The major beneficiaries are Saudi Arabia, the gulf sheikdoms, the Soviet Union and the Texas and Oklahoma oil producers in the United States. Clearly, Iraq has done a great economic service for the world's arms and oil producers.
Since these arms and oil producers are loudly proclaiming that they are taking economic and military action against Iraq in the ''noble'' cause of upholding the United Nations Charter on nonaggression, may I suggest that all profits from arms sales to the region and from higher oil prices be channeled into a special United Nations fund.
The money thus received could then be redistributed to the poor states of the world, who are more severely affected by these actions of the rich states, who are busy profiteering in arms and oil.
Unless some such form of reverse economic sanctions can be adopted, it may be far too tempting for these arms and oil producers not to seek diplomatic solutions at all, but to prolong the Persian Gulf crisis indefinitely.

HEADLINE: Supreme Court Should Protect Economic and Civil Liberties

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''Why Liberals May Long for Bork'' (Op-Ed, Sept. 28) Gary L. McDowell overreacts to the likely consequences of a Supreme Court that would be more vigilant in protecting private property rights. He fears, for example, that a Court that protected private property rights would strike down rent control and minimum wage laws. Amen.
Rent control has only produced housing shortages, housing deterioration and condo conversions, which have mainly harmed the poor - especially lower-income minorities - in whose name the laws were enacted. The Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs has estimated that rent control in New York City causes an average loss of 30,000 housing units a year. The Amsterdam News once reported, ''we in minority areas are forced to live in rat-infested apartments that resemble bombed-out war areas,'' and that such conditions are rapidly increasing ''solely because of rent control.'' 
The minimum wage law has also been harmful, despite good intentions, by pricing out of the market the least-skilled members of the work force. Because of inferior educational opportunities and other reasons, minority youth are disproportionately harmed by the minimum wage law.
Mr. McDowell also confuses the relationship between protecting private property rights and environmental protection laws. As the legal scholar Morton J. Horwitz shows in ''The Transformation of American Law, 1780-1860'' (Cambridge, Mass., 1977), until the mid-19th century, American common law upheld the property rights of individuals to sue for damages from industrial pollution. ''Natural uses of land,'' Mr. Horwitz states, were favored ''by strict liability in tort: any interference with the property of another gave rise to liability.''
Class-action suits against polluters were also frequent under common law property rights, but were eventually outlawed by most state legislatures as the legal system moved from the protection of individual property rights under the theory that economic growth was in the ''public interest, and should supercede the protection of individual rights.''
In short, the social and economic problems Mr. McDowell is concerned about have come about or have been exacerbated precisely because the legal system has largely abandoned its protection of individual property rights. What we should all hope for is a Supreme Court that will protect our economic as well as our civil liberties.

HEADLINE: THE REGION;
Meanwhile, the Bad News From Albany Is Released Quietly

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT

DATELINE: ALBANY

 BODY:
So loud was the clamor of bad news from New York City last week that the pessimistic din in Albany was barely audible.
That was probably just as well for state officials, who are up for re-election in three weeks. Until recently, it had seemed as if a conspiracy of silence was gripping Albany - no one would talk about the bad news until after the election. Now, as it trickled out, it was drowned by the cacophony of dire reports from City Hall. 
Even a week ago, when voters' attention was focused on Mayor David N. Dinkins and the city's suddenly worrisome financial prospects, Governor Cuomo called together his top staff members and told them to expect the worst for the state as well. The word leaked out that the state was in for another round of budget cuts. But, compared with Mr. Dinkins's prediction that 15,000 might be laid off, the news from the Governor's office seemed ho-hum.
Then on Thursday, Mr. Cuomo, violating an election year taboo, said in an interview with New York Times editors and reporters that layoffs and tuition increases might be necessary to balance the budget.
Unlike Mayor Dinkins, he refused to estimate how many might be laid off or how much tuition might rise. Still, his tone was grim. ''I believe we're in for a period of pain, and I think we have to be prepared for that,'' he said.
Mr. Cuomo currently enjoys such a wide lead in the polls that it seems that no matter how dim a view of the state's future he takes, his own political future is unlikely to be affected. Nevertheless, mentioning layoffs and tuition increases a month before an election seemed like an unusually splashy move by the normally cautious Governor, and it prompted a good deal of speculation in the world of state politics, where Mr. Cuomo's motives are analyzed more carefully than any mere economic data.
Some officials speculated that Mr. Cuomo had knowingly forecast doom at a time when his predictions, overshadowed by the city's problems, were least likely to attract attention. Others suggested that his comments were a warning to city officials not to expect the state to bail them out.
''I think that what the Governor is doing is sending an alarm,'' said the Assembly Speaker, Mel Miller, a Brooklyn Democrat. ''I think he's feeling some pressure from the city.''
And still others submitted that the Governor did not want to be accused later, as Massachusetts Governor Michael S. Dukakis was, of having deceived the electorate to further his own career.
''If he has aspirations for higher office, he doesn't want to be accused of hiding anything,'' one New York City official said.
Whatever motives they ascribed to Mr. Cuomo, few analysts disagreed about the conclusion: New York State is facing dismal financial prospects in the year ahead. Many said that the problem was likely to be even worse than the Governor suggested. And coming after two years of tax increases and record deficits, some of which were filled with ''one-shot revenues'' and adjustments in the state's books, next year's budget problems, they said, are likely to prove particularly intractable.
''I would say the two New Yorks - the city and the state - are both going to be in the very difficult position of making major adjustments to their budgets,'' said Raymond D. Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a watchdog group financed by businesses.
Most state officials were not surprised by the Governor's gloomy predictions. What took them aback was that he shared them with the voters. There are topics that, according to the unwritten rules of politics, are just not discussed during election season.
In addition to the possibilities of layoffs or tuition increases, these include pay raises for state lawmakers, who, under state law must either increase their salaries by the end of this year or wait for a raise until 1993. State legislators, who earn $57,000 a year for what is ostensibly a part-time job, last raised their salaries in 1987. In the State Capitol, there has been quiet speculation that pay would be raised, although lawmakers, all of whom are up for reelection next month, publicly deny the possibility.
Another topic that still seems off limits for now is the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's troubles. There will be a special session of the State Legislature in December to deal with them, but discussion of it has been minimized.
The only item officially on the Legislature's agenda in December is an extension of the corporate surcharge that nets the M.T.A. about $325 million a year. But the New York City Transit Authority is predicting a $250 million deficit next year, and the M.T.A.'s commuter railways are expecting one of $50 million.
The M.T.A. has three options: increased state aid, fare increases or service cuts. Increased state aid is unlikely in hard times like these, and who wants to talk about fare increases or service cuts right before an election?
''Everybody's known about the M.T.A.'s problems for months,'' said Cynthia Green, a Citizens Budget Commission analyst. ''After November, one of the big issues is going to be that the M.T.A.'s also in trouble - as big trouble as the city or the state.''
There may be other, equally discomfiting topics waiting to be broached, but they aren't even being discussed in the halls of the Capitol yet.

As a Climax Looms, One Has to Wonder: Was There a Plot?

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY

 BODY:
The budget melodrama that has riveted Washington for the past five months may finally be reaching a climax. Here is a plot summary and brief guide to what may happen next:
First there was a budget summit where 17 congressional leaders and three Administration officials argued about whether to slash the deficit by raising taxes or by cutting spending. The President wanted to cut the tax rate for capital gains; Democrats called thata boon to the rich and acceptable only if income tax rates for the wealthy were also increased. When the sumiteers couldn't agree, the President said some taxes could be raised but not income tax rates. That angered House Republicans, who oppose any tax hikes.
Then summiteers reached an impasse and formed a smaller group, where only top congressional leaders and the three Administration officials argued. The ''mini budget summit'' produced a plan that would raise taxes and cut spending, particularly for Medicare, but it left income tax rates and the capital gains rate alone. That plan was soundly defeated by the House of Representatives, and the Government briefly shut down for lack of money. Democrats blamed the President, the Republicans blamed the Democrats and everybodoy blamed the President's men, the White House chief of staff John Sununu and the Budget Director, Richard Darman. 
Then Congress wrote its own deficit-reduction plans, and the President at first said he might be willing to consider a tradeoff between a lower capital gains rate and higher tax rates for the wealthy. Then he changed his mind, several times.
Now he wants a plan like the one the House rejected. A variation on that plan will be presented to the House early next week, and it will probably fail. Instead, the House is likely to approve a Democratic alternative that raises tax rates for the wealthy and cuts the capital gains tax rate, but not in quite the way the President had in mind. House Republicans will have an opportunity to offer an alternative, but at the moment they can't agree on one.
Meanwhile, the Senate has come up with a bipartisan plan that doesn't touch tax rates or cut the capital gains tax. If it passes, the House and Senate will argue until they reach a compromise.
 
What Happens Next
By tomorrow, the 24 Congressional committees instructed to meet deficit reduction goals must report their decisions to the House and Senate Budget Committees. Budget panels will stitch the recommendations together and present them as a single package for votes in the House and Senate. Floor amendments are permitted. Once each chamber approves its package, a conference committee will meet to iron out any differences in the two versions. Conference agreement must then be approved by House and Senate and sent to the President for signature.
 
The Points Of Contention
 
Taxing
 
GASOLINE: House Democrats would avoid any increase in the current 9 cent a gallon Federal tax on motor fuels, but a bipartisan plan from the Senate Finance Committee would mean a boost of 9.5 cents.
 
EXCISE TAXES: Increases in excise taxes on beer, wine, spirits and cigarettes seem to be on everybody's agenda.
 
MEDICARE TAX: Workers are currently taxed on the first $51,300 of their wages to help finance the hospital insurance portion of the Medicare program. The wage base will almost certainly be increased.
 
CAPITAL GAINS: House Democrats have found a way to cut the gains tax rate to benefit the middle class and limit advantages for the wealthy. House Republicans, and some of their conservative allies in the Senate, are still looking for the type of reduction President Bush proposed in January. The Senate Finance Committee's bipartisan plan would leave the rate unchanged from current law - the same as that for ordinary income.
 
INCOME TAXES: House Democrats would boost the top tax rate to 33 percent, from the current 28 percent for families with incomes over $200,000 and impose a 10 percent surtax on incomes over $1 million. House Republicans vigorously oppose the rate increase, and Senators in both parties decided to leave tax rates alone. The Senate Finance Committee, however, would limit itemized deductions for wealthy taxpayers with incomes over $100,000.
 
Spending
 
MEDICARE: Lawmakers in both parties want to avoid an angry backlash from senior citizens groups who oppose the deep spending cuts initially contemplated. Monthly premiums will increase slightly, and deductibles will also rise, but House and Senate differ on how much. The biggest hit will come for health care providers.
 
FARM PROGRAMS: Crop subsidy levels will be reduced by altering formulas for acreage set asides.
 
DISCRETIONARY SPENDING: Democrats would hold spending to levels needed to keep pace with inflation. Spending increases that exceed the expected inflation rate may be proposed in popular programs like education and law enforcement, but they will require belt tightening elsewhere to meet deficit reduction goals. House Republicans are seeking much deeper across the board cuts, and some Republicans are prepared to take a bigger bite out of military programs. All the deficit plans will mean new ''user fees'' for a variety of Government services ranging from camping permits at national parks, to processing of patent applications to customs inspections.

An Aversion to Taxing Taxable Substances

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Canadians routinely pay more than $30 for a carton of cigarettes. Italians pay more than $5 for a gallon of gasoline. Danes not only pay $1.50 plus deposit for a store-bought bottle of beer but face such high prices for cigarettes - close to $4 a pack - that a Danish embassy spokesman, Bent Skou, says ''nobody in his right mind'' buys a whole carton at once.
Yet Americans are in near revolt over increases in their own ''sin'' taxes that would leave consumers here still paying small fractions of the prices levied in most industrial countries. 
''We generated well over a million letters,'' said Jeff Becker, a spokesman for the Beer Institute, the industry group behind the highly visible can-the-beer-tax campaign. This drive is intended to head off a proposed increase in a Federal beer levy that has not been raised, not even to offset inflation, since 1951.
The package produced by Congressional and Bush Administration budget negotiators included an increase of 16 cents a six-pack. The negotiators proposed to raise the Federal tax on cigarettes to 24 cents a pack from 16 cents and the gasoline tax to 21 cents from 9 cents. Wine would rise by about 22 cents a bottle. As Congress struggles to reconfigure the budget package, which was voted down because of Medicare cuts as well as the tax proposals, the current versions include few changes in the tobacco and alcohol proposals but scale back the increase in the gasoline tax.
The situation is in part a result of the Federal Government's tacit agreement over the years to reserve these sources of revenue largely for the states, which have come to rely heavily on them. The Beer Institute calculates that state taxes on its product have soared 650 percent since the early 1950's, roughly in line with inflation, and that several states have levies more than triple the Federal one of $9 a barrel, or 16 cents a six-pack. The Federal cigarette tax is 16 cents a pack, while most state levies are higher.
The states are becoming more aggressive, too. California, for example, recently doubled its gasoline tax, from 9 cents to 18 cents, and Montana proposes to slap an additional 25 cents on its cigarette tax, bringing it to 43 cents a pack.
 
Double Dips
 When Federal and state taxes are combined, American motorists - to take perhaps the most glaring example when the country is fielding troops in the Mideast to defend oil supplies - feel burdened. They are furious about the proposed increase in the Federal gasoline levy, which is unlikely to exceed 10 cents and would leave a retail gallon at barely one-third the price in Europe, Japan and Canada.
Since 1951, according to the Congressional Budget Office, the cigarette tax has decreased by half when adjusted for inflation, while the real Federal tax on beer and table wine is only one-fourth as high.
There are, of course, various replies. Many dwell on the regressive nature of excise taxes. Others contend that motorists, say, might be willing to pay higher gasoline taxes so long as the money was used for building or repairing roads and bridges, but not if it was earmarked to pay debts run up by the citizenry at large.
There is also the argument that Americans have tailored their commuting and other patterns to covering vast distances with inexpensive gasoline. ''People have adapted their behavior to this price structure,'' said Michael E. Canes, chief economist for the American Petroleum Institute. ''Then somebody comes along and says, 'Let's change.' ''
Moreover, the increases are proposed at a time when, driven by the situation in the Mideast, oil prices are already surging.
And while the states are jealously seeking to protect their tax sources, Congress is the constant object of lobbying efforts by the industries that know any increase in taxes for their product will reduce demand. They have been especially busy in the last few weeks.
For any number of reasons, the betting is that Washington will continue to tax the American consumer relatively lightly for his indulgences, even while the Federal Government reminds him of the need to conserve gasoline and warns that smoking and drinking are bad for his health.
''To a European,'' ventured Mr. Skou, ''it does sound a little eccentric.''

The Socialists' New Class Struggle: How to Survive Communism's Fall

BYLINE: By FRANK J. PRIAL

 BODY:
The world's most prominent Socialists - the council of the Socialist International - convened in New York last week with certain misgivings. After all, Americans have not been particularly cordial to Socialism since the days of Eugene V. Debs; in fact, they put him in jail. Norman Thomas, the most illustrious American Socialist in modern times, was pelted with eggs and frequently invited out of town.
From a time almost 80 years ago, when there were 56 Socialist mayors and Debs himself garnered 900,000 votes as a Presidential candidate, Socialism in this country has dwindled to two fringe parties whose idealism, it could be said, is in inverse proportion to their political clout. 
Former German Chancellor Willy Brandt, who is president of the Socialist International and who was chairman of the Socialists' two-day meeting at the Waldorf Astoria, spoke to their uncertainties in his opening remarks. ''I know the word 'Socialist' does not have a very favorable connotation for many Americans,'' he said, adding ruefully, ''and nowadays, I am afraid, for people in other places, too.''.
Which may be why it was the first time the International had held a meeting in the United States in over a hundred years. And perhaps the Socialists chose the Waldorf, something of a capitalist icon, to indicate that they are not entirely anti-establishment. More than a few of the delegates grumbled about the venue, observing that a night there costs more than the annual per capita income in some third world countries.
During the two-day session, the Socialists did what politicians do: they argued, they viewed with alarm, and they passed resolutions on everything from the status of South Africa and North-South relations to the unsolved murder of one of their leaders in Guatemala last January. But between meetings they turned to their unpublished agenda: the future, if any, of the Socialist movement.
Since the bitter split between Socialists and Communists more than 70 years ago, the Socialists, or more precisely, the Social Democratic parties around the world, have thought of themselves as the front-line bulwark against Communist totalitarianism. ''The Leninist hubris of a party laying sole claim to unmistakable truths was totally alien to Social Democrats,'' Mr. Brandt said.
But if Socialists define themselves in terms of their opposition to Communism, what are they to become now that Communism is, for all practical purposes, defunct?
In fact, while Communism may be finished, its legacy could still prove troublesome for Socialists. Writing in Dissent recently about the changes in Eastern Europe, Alan Ryan, a former Oxford don who teaches politics at Princeton, noted, ''All the difficulties of the transition will be ascribed to the legacy of a vaguely defined 'socialism' and all the improvements to a vaguely defined 'free market system.' '' In vain, Social Democrats have been arguing that the Eastern European bureaucracies were not really Socialist at all. True Socialism, they have always said, can only exist within a democratic society, under a parliamentary-style government.
''Let's face it,'' former Chancellor Brandt said last week, ''Socialism has been discredited by the mess created in the so-called 'socialist countries.' But there should be no doubt that what existed in Central and Eastern Europe was anything but Democratic Socialism - or Social Democracy, as I prefer to call it.''
The irony here is inescapable: the extinction of Communism represents a considerable victory for Social Democracy - if it isn't dragged down with the very movement it fought so long and courageously to end.
Some say this has already happened. The economist Robert Heilbroner wrote recently about what he calls ''the demise of socialism.'' While still powerful as an organizing idea in the third world, he observed, ''in the materially more advanced nations, 'socialism' as a distinct social objective has disappeared. Nothing is left of it but a better-run capitalism.''
Not everyone is so pessimistic. To some thinkers, the collapse of Communism, far from presaging the downfall of Socialism, could be the source of its renewal. According to this view, the former Communist states of Eastern Europe will swerve rapidly to the right, to old-style, unregulated free market economies.
''Socialism is a dirty word now in Eastern Europe,'' said Jean-Pierre Cott, a French Socialist and the leader of the 180 Socialists in the 518-member European Parliament. ''They will go to laissez faire, then they will wake up with a hangover. Some will want to go right back to Communism, but I think they will look more to Social Democratic principles.''
Social Democracy will, Mr. Brandt believes, provide ''a third way,'' a political and economic choice somewhere between the now abhorrent centralized economies of the recent past and the unfettered capitalism to come.
''We Social Democrats advocate a mixed economy, which does not mean that we have a fixed formula for the proper mix,'' he said. ''No one has to convince us that market forces are indispensable for economic growth, but we also believe that private interest must be attuned to the public interest in social justice and ecological survival.''
Mr. Cott warned that the Social Democrats might be acting too precipitously in Eastern Europe, throwing their support behind anyone who claims to be a free-market Socialist. ''There is a future for Social Democracy,'' he said. ''We must be in a position to provide a true democratic alternative when the time comes. In the meantime, we must be careful - not just go with the winners, but seek out the true representatives of social justice. We have a saying in France: Never go faster than the music.''

A Land of Immigrants Gets Uneasy About Immigration

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The incidents span a decade and a continent: Gulf Coast fishermen in Texas harass Vietnamese competitors who are catching more shrimp. A Florida supermarket manager suspends a cashier for speaking Spanish at work. Residents of a Maryland community protest the establishment of a Japanese junior college near the Chesapeake Bay. Two Los Angeles suburbs try to require Chinese store owners to put up English signs. A Massachusetts gubernatorial candidate, John Silber, asks, ''Why should Lowell be the Cambodian capital of America?''
For some observers of American history and politics, the incidents evoke disturbing memories of the virulent, anti-Catholic and anti-Semitic nativism of the 1920's, or, more distant, the open hatreds of the 1890's, when William J. H. Traynor of the American Protective Association opposed granting the right to vote to the ''pauper and criminal riffraff of Europe'' and ''every ignorant Dago and Pole, Hun and Slav.'' 
Some of the same combustible elements of those years are present in America again. With the Northeast already mired in economic hard times and other regions teetering on the edge, will immigrants who arrived in record numbers in the 1980's become a lightning rod for the anger of a swelling crowd of economic losers? ''In the past few months there's been a perception that the pie is not expanding, and those are the times when zero-sum solutions raise their ugly heads,'' observed Gregory Fossedal, the head of the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, a research foundation based in Palo Alto, Calif., that favors immigration.
Despite some disturbing incidents, there are few signs that the kind of organized anti-immigration movements of decades past are rising again. The strident voice of the nativist has faded. In fact, the House recently passed a bill that would increase annual immigration ceilings by 45 percent, to 775,000. But political scientists say that the immigration debate has created new political fault lines and disrupted old alliances. As often as not, the voices expressing concerns of increased immigration come from people who once would have been called liberals.
As immigration becomes a greater component of population growth, environmentalists and population control advocates have begun to consider more seriously the case for controls. Nancy Wallace, who directs the Sierra Club's International Population Program, argues that ''any immigration legislation should be part of a national population policy moving toward stabilization as fast as possible.''
Immigration has also caused rifts in the civil rights coalition. Recently the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People hesitated before agreeing to support Hispanic groups in their effort to repeal Federal sanctions against employers of illegal aliens. This month, Hazel Dukes, New York State president of the N.A.A.C.P., said, ''Why let foreigners or newcomers have these jobs while blacks, who have been here for hundreds of years, can't support themselves or their families?'' She later apologized.
In fact, her presumption that unskilled immigrants take jobs from unskilled Americans has lost support among most economists. In his book ''Friends or Strangers,'' George J. Borjas argues that ratios of immigrants in major metropolitan labor markets have trivial effects on wage rates and no effect on unemployment.
But provisions in the Senate version of the current immigration bill that would substantially increase the number of skilled immigrants brought in by corporate employers to fill special labor needs has raised fears that immigrants will occupy the higher rungs of the economic ladder, hindering the mobility of those below. ''The question is, should immigration be encouraged or should national policy encourage training to allow those here, including blacks, to take those jobs?'' said Arthur F. Brimmer, a former member of the board of governors of the Federal Reserve. ''My own view is that we should do both.''
Although he argued against the issue of economic competition from unskilled immigrants, Mr. Borjas raised a separate issue in a recent paper co-authored with another economist, Stephen J. Trejo. The newer the immigrant, they say, the more likely he is to draw welfare.
Others argue that immigrants may threaten the nation's linguistic cohesion. In 1983 a group called U.S. English was founded to promote ordinances, laws and state constitutional amendments making English the official language of one jurisdiction after another. Early this year, a Federal court struck down a constitutional amendment in Arizona. In 1989 a Federal court overturned an ordinance in Pomona, Calif. - apparently directed at Chinese store owners - mandating that half the space on foreign-language commercial signs be devoted to ''English alphabetical characters.''
But these ripples do not change the conclusion of David H. Bennett, author of ''The Party of Fear,'' a 1988 study of nativism, that hostility toward immigrants has declined significantly as a political force since World War II. Many historians, economists and social scientists are not asking why there were so many echoes of nativism in the 1980's, but why there were so few.
''If you look back on American society 30 years from now, you'll say in the 1980's there was a watershed in American society and one of the indications was that there was a change in the attitudes toward foreigners - though not to foreign competition,'' said Michael J. Piore, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
''I think that what happened in the course of the 1970's and 1980's was that the United States really redefined itself as a multiracial society; there was a general acceptance that society was going to be composed of a variety of different groups and we had to develop a tolerance of them. I don't want to say there's no resentment. There is a lot, more than is being expressed. But it is not being organized, and people don't organize their thoughts around the idea that you can solve these problems by closing the borders.''
Martin Heisler, an expert on immigration at the University of Maryland, said: ''I'm surprised the reaction hasn't been stronger here, compared with some European countries. The limits of tolerance for pluralism should have been stretched by now, and they don't seem to have been. Are we experiencing a linear expansion in our ability to cope with incredible social diversity?''
But nativism may not be gone forever, said Dr. Piore. ''I believe that there are different conceptions of American society that in some ways are contradictory,'' he said. An essential ingredient of America's self-image is its history as a nation of immigrants. That image ''has always been around even in the worst nativist periods,'' he said. ''And the nativist image is always going to be around in the most tolerant periods.
''Whatever happened in American society in the 70's and 80's has brought forth a more tolerant vision. But the problems of working out a multiracial and multiethnic society are immense. I can well believe that at some point those problems would accumulate and we'll go back'' to America's nativist past.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
In Some Fights, Quitting Is Harder Than Joining In

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Of the panoply of issues the United States and the Soviet Union still face if they are to put the Cold War completely behind them, none appear more nettlesome than resolving the longstanding civil wars fought by their clients in Afghanistan, Angola and Cambodia.
The superpowers have agreed that it is time to end the conflicts, because neither wishes to spend billions of scarce dollars to prolong anachronistic wars that seem unwinnable anyway. But having resolved their own fundamental differences, they still face a difficult problem: pacifying the very factions they once helped inspire to fight. All too frequently, the clients have their own intractable interests, disputes and weaknesses. ''We are finding that it was easier to get into the wars as enemies than it is to get out of them as friends, even as we sit on the same side of the negotiating table,'' said an American military official. 
The Afghan civil war, which froze American-Soviet relations when Moscow intervened with 115,000 troops in 1979, is the regional conflict the two superpowers most want to resolve. The Soviets fear that the war between the Government it installed and Islamic fundamentalist insurgents could spread ill will to nearby Soviet Muslim republics. And some Bush Administration officials privately question the wisdom of sending $300 million a year to fundamentalists who do not share Western values, now that the Soviet Army has withdrawn.
When the Soviets pulled their forces out of Afghanistan two years ago, many officials in Washington expected the Government of President Najibullah to fall quickly. But the rebels splintered into factions and the Government survived.
Rumors of a superpower agreement on organizing elections and an interim Government peaked in August, when Mr. Najibullah arrived in the Soviet Union for what was described as a month-long health check-up - only a day before Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, were to meet in Siberia. American officials noted with interest suggestions in the Soviet press that Moscow was ready to cut aid to Mr. Najibullah and press him to negotiate in earnest with the guerrillas. But Mr. Najibullah returned home pledging to stay in power, and the rebels have expressed little enthusiasm for elections.
American officials insist they are near an agreement with the Soviets, with the role for Mr. Najibullah in an interim Government the only major issue not yet resolved. ''We and the Soviets are interested in responsible disengagement,'' said a senior State Department official. ''They want Najibullah's departure to be part of the process, but they don't want to pull the rug out from under him.''
American and Soviet officials have made the most dramatic progress in their attempts to negotiate an end to the 15-year civil war in Angola, where the United States is still covertly sending $60 million a year to the Unita guerrillas fighting a Soviet-backed Government. A worsening famine has persuaded the superpowers to actively nudge their clients to find a settlement; three weeks ago American and Soviet officials directly took part in the peace talks for the first time, and agreed in principle to jointly lead an international monitoring group to supervise a future cease-fire and elections.
But before that can happen, the Angolan sides must negotiate an enforceable cease-fire, and deep resentment and distrust stand in the way. Jonas Savimbi, the rebel leader, insists on immediate recognition of Unita as a political party and the holding of elections next year. President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, however, says full recognition of Unita would have to await an amendment of the Angolan Constitution to permit a multiparty system; he also says the country will need years to rebuild before elections can be held.
Of the three conflicts, the superpowers share the most similar goals in Cambodia. Both are trying to prevent a return to power by the Khmer Rouge, the violent Communist rebel group that is held responsible for the deaths of more than a million people while it ruled in the late 1970's. It was overthrown in 1978 by a Vietnamese invasion force that quickly installed a less radical Communist Government with Soviet support. Vietnam's troops left Cambodia last year, but the Government, under Hun Sen, remains in power.
Over the last four months, the Bush Administration has begun to talk to Hanoi and Phnom Penh, regimes it had shunned, as part of a multi-pronged effort to end the war. With the other members of the United Nations Security Council, Moscow and Washington together have persuaded the Hun Sen Government, the Khmer Rouge, and the two other guerrilla groups to agree to establish a council that would share power with the United Nations until elections can be held. So far, however, bickering among the four sides has stalled the formation of the body.
One reason Cambodia has proven so difficult for the United States and Soviet Union is that their influence there is limited, in part because China plays a vital role in the conflict and continues to support the Khmer Rouge. Economic depression, corruption and ideological divisions appear to weaken the Soviet-supported regime month by month, and this has only added momentum to the Khmer Rouge march.
''Neither of us can wash our hands and neither of us has overwhelming leverage to dictate solutions,'' said the senior State Department official. ''All we can do is point the way.''

HEADLINE: THE WORLD: Japan's Shrewd New Investment Strategy . . .;;
. . . Moves Beyond Rockefeller Center and Pebble Beach

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
If all goes as planned in the next few weeks, E.T., the cuddly extra-terrestrial, will have a new parent. Matsushita, the giant consumer electronics maker known in the United States as Panasonic, is negotiating what may be a $7 billion takeover of MCA, the owner of Universal Studios and one of the recording industry's biggest labels. And sometime in the next few months, the faltering American automobile industry will have a new car plant: Toyota executives are mulling over the politically proper site for a huge new plant, which has scores of Toyota suppliers here and politicians in several state capitals salivating.
While such mega-acquisitions and new plants seem familiar, this year they are actually the exception. Japan is buying abroad faster than ever - this year its direct investments will be an estimated $55 billion, up 25 percent from 1989. But, suddenly, it is buying small. Japan is acquiring small firms and new technologies, putting less at risk but building an ever-deeper infrastructure to support its late-1980's buying spree. The strategy seems bound to solidify Japan's position in the United States and in Europe, where serious Japanese money is also starting to flow. More important for the Japanese, lots of smaller acquisitions may attract less attention than a few big ones. 
The evidence this year suggests that Japan is learning how to invest with the least possible political resistance, especially from those who have a vague sense that the United States risks turning into an economic colony. Only a handful of the record 328 overseas acquisitions and major investments Japan has made in the first nine months of this year - more than half of them in the United States - has drawn much attention, much less serious opposition. Even the biggest buy this year, Fujitsu Ltd.'s purchase of ICL, Britain's only major computer maker, drew only limited protest.
''The Japanese are learning how to make their acquisitions less high-profile,'' said Andrew S. Grove, the chief of Intel Corporation, who is one of the most vocal critics of the dangers of selling strategic parts of the American industrial base abroad.
Much of the buying is taking place, quietly, in Mr. Grove's own backyard, Silicon Valley. Yet he detects less resistance. ''People are battle weary,'' said Mr. Grove, whose company's microprocessors are among the few products that have held Japan at bay. ''And if they do not crave Japanese investment, they work their way to the point where it is the only option.''
Ever since Sony bought Columbia Pictures and Mitsubishi Estates acquired a controlling interest in Rockefeller Center last year, the Japanese Government has quietly warned industry here against conspicuous purchases. Matsushita's proposed deal is the first to go against the guideline. Yet, big or small, Japanese companies have learned how to portray every purchase as an ''invited'' one, which is often true. With the stock market down and venture capital scarce in the United States, such invitations will keep coming.
To the Japanese, new plants like Toyota's are regarded as the best option of all; they create new jobs without the political complications of corporate takeover. More than 30 states maintain Tokyo offices to vie for such investments. What neither side discusses much is the growing evidence that such factories balloon the trade deficit in their first years of operation, as tons of Japanese-made robots and machine tools are brought in.
One could argue that the investments getting the biggest publicity are the ones to worry about least. The Japanese investor who just paid between $800 million and $1 billion for the Pebble Beach Golf Club is hardly about to move it from the California coast to Hokkaido. And no one suggests that E.T. will be snatched from American screens. The bigger concern is whether Japanese-owned American movie makers will pick up signals from their owners to steer clear of subjects or scenes Japan finds distasteful. Akio Morita, Sony's chairman, says Columbia Pictures is free to venture into taboo subjects such as the war-time role of Emperor Hirohito but the less politically savvy Matsushita has so far voiced no such guarantees for MCA.
But golf clubs and movie studios have little to do with long-term questions of American competitiveness. The small deals often raise exactly those fears, though they usually involve technologies too abstruse to debate about in Congress or constituencies too small to make themselves heard. A few months ago, the Bush Administration toyed with the thought of blocking the sale of a tiny company called Semi-Gas Systems, one of the few surviving American makers of the highly specialized equipment used to turn silicon into computer chips. In the end, the Government decided there was no national security issue at stake, a move Senator Albert Gore called ''absurd and ridiculous.''
But making a claim that national security - or even industrial competitiveness - will be irreparably damaged by the acquisition of any single company is nearly impossible. The damage happens in the aggregate: already some American chip makers say Japanese equipment makers are slowing their access to state-of-the-art equipment.
Some of Japan's purchases have allowed old line companies to break into new territories, such as Nippon Mining Company's $1.1 billion purchase of Gould Inc. in 1988. But most of the recent buying is to support businesses built in the late 1980's. Kubota Ltd., a farm equipment maker, entered the high technology field a few years ago with an investment in a promising computer maker named Stardent and a hot Silicon Valley chip maker named MIPS. Since then it has assembled a cluster of companies making a range of components.
Other companies are building bit by bit. Matsushita is using Solubourne Computer, a maker of advanced workstations, to get back into the computer business. Fujitsu owns a majority stake in a firm making super-small, lightweight PC's, and is transferring some of the technology to Japan. American auto-parts makers complain that Nissan, Honda and Toyota carry in their wake a host of suppliers, who use Japanese transplants to get into the American market.
Japanese argue, accurately, that they are saving many American firms, providing capital they cannot get at home. But it is nothing new for nations to insist that profits and the control of vital industries stay within their borders. It is only new to the United States, which never before had to deal with the question.
So far the Bush Administration has been unwilling to address the issue. But it is up to America, not Japan, to figure out an alternative to Japanese capital. As Mr. Morita said last year, ''If you don't want Japan to buy it, then don't sell it.''

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Japan's Shrewd New Investment Strategy . . .

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
From time to time over the last five years, economists played an intellectual game of calculating what might happen if Japanese institutions halted their massive purchases of United States Treasury bonds, issued to finance the yawning Federal budget deficits. It seemed a flight of fancy, since Japan's appetite for the securities seemed so vast. But last week the United States got a taste of the real thing.
On Wednesday, in the midst of Washington's fumblings over a deficit-reduction package and the simmering Persian Gulf crisis, the Japanese institutions that used to snap up as much as 40 percent of the new securities were conspicuously absent from an important auction. Demand for the $8.5 billion of bonds was the weakest in seven years. Interest rates inched higher, the dollar slipped lower and Wall Street grew nervous. 
The poor auction results were just one knock in a roller-coaster week. But Japanese institutions were less than contrite. After a decade of being battered by broken promises on budget-deficit reduction, volatile exchange rates and disappointing returns, they had had enough.
''The situation has completely changed,'' said Yoshihiko Miyabe, who helps design the international strategies of the Yasuda Trust & Banking Corp., a leading Japanese institutional investor. ''Japanese investors have been through an educational period, where they learned a lot in the first stage and made many mistakes. Companies are getting more cautious now, and they think more about strategies.''
That represents one part of a major shift in the way Japan is investing its cash hoard overseas, a change likely to have far-reaching implications for the financial markets and many American companies. The outflow of Japanese capital, though still large, is slowing, a result of steep if little-noticed declines in Japan's trade surpluses.
Meanwhile, the investments still being made abroad are generally far more carefully targeted. They are being aimed much more clearly at sharpening the competitiveness of Japanese companies. The challenge to American industry is growing as a result, just as the Japanese are making it harder for Washington to finance its fiscal excesses.
One major factor behind the trend has been the sharp reduction in Japan's current account surplus - the broadest measure of the flow of goods and services into and out of the country. It has tumbled from a peak of $87 billion in 1987 to $57 billion last year. In the first half of 1990, the surplus was only $20.5 billion, an annual rate of $41 billion.
In addition, Japanese interest rates have risen sharply, making it more attractive for investors to keep their money at home rather than face the risks, and the political controversy, of placing it in the United States.
Mr. Miyabe of Yasuda Trust said that two years ago the pension funds his company manages had invested as much as 23 percent of their assets overseas, mostly in the United States. Today, he said, the proportion invested abroad is about 15 percent, ''and that will go down further.'' The decline, he and others added, comes not from large outright sales of securities, but from a slowdown in new investments to the States. Japanese institutions, which are heavily invested in the American securities markets, say they are conscious of the need to slow their purchase of securities without jolting Wall Street.
Previously, the largest share of Japanese overseas investment went into securities, chiefly Treasury bonds. They looked stable, and the interest rates were double the level for comparable Japanese Government bonds. But Japanese institutions were net sellers of $8.9 billion of American securities in the first half of this year - an astounding reversal from their purchases of $17.4 billion in such securities in the last six months of 1989.
In another switch, Japanese capital is now going mainly into direct investment - factories, companies and real estate. The Japanese will still acquire factories that help them dominate markets; labs that give them the latest technology, or production studios to provide the movies to be shown on the video machines they manufacture. But they are generally keeping a sharper focus on what will produce a stronger position in the marketplace.
The Japanese are also diversifying their direct foreign investment. The United States is still the largest single target, but increasing amounts are flowing to Europe and Southeast Asia.
In 1987, direct investment made up 14 percent of the outflow of capital from Japan; in the first half of 1990 it made up 70 percent. Japanese capital, in short, is getting scarcer but shrewder. The Japanese are trying to make sure it helps their strategic and competitive goals, and does not fall down the black hole of financial uncertainty.
''This all suits Japan's strategic interests,'' said Kenneth Courtis, chief economist here for Deutsche Bank. ''They have learned some valuable lessons. But in some ways, it is a scary scenario.''

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
A Time of Confusion Draws the Arab World Into Soul-Searching

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM

DATELINE: JIDDA, Saudi Arabia

 BODY:
From Algeria to Bahrain, public opinion in the Arab world is undergoing the most troubled soul-searching it has experienced in modern times. The massacre at Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem last Monday, in which the Israeli police killed at least 21 Palestinians during a riot, has further inflamed Arab emotions already driven to new peaks by the Gulf crisis. But it has done little to clarify the entanglements, confusion and discord unleashed by the invasion of Kuwait and the arrival of an enormous American-led military force in Saudi Arabia, clearly prepared for battle with Iraq.
Uncharacteristically, Arab intellectuals are giving their own countries' assumptions and actions a hard look - rather than looking for more convenient sources of blame abroad - as they seek explanations for the disunity, poverty, antagonisms and social tensions that have been laid bare in this difficult time.
To be sure, Islam remains a potent rallying cry for all the aggrieved parties in the Middle East, but its cynical use to justify diametrically opposed views has rendered it a thin veneer that barely masks a profound change in Arab attitudes - an evolution of major importance far beyond the Middle East, for nowhere else are the West's economic and strategic interests so intertwined with such byzantine regional problems, involving Muslim and Jewish religious passions, oil and money, thousands of hostages, and old political hostilities. 
The Gulf crisis has undone virtually all the regional alliances of the last few years, placing moderate countries like Jordan in the Iraqi camp and militant nations like Syria in the American-Saudi camp. It has driven Arab intellectuals to despair as they try to define primary and secondary Arab vital interests in the crisis, and what links they are to make between Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and Israel's continued occupation of Arab lands.
Among the Arab masses, the crisis in the Gulf, now amplified by the killings in Jerusalem, has brought forth raw feelings of frustration and deep anger, pushing Muslim fundamentalists into the same trenches with secular Arab nationalists - a union of purpose that only a few weeks ago would have appeared unimaginable. In this they were both driven by a deep antipathy toward the United States and the West, which for four decades have supported Israel and, the Arabs feel, neglected the Palestinian cause. Meanwhile, there has been ample room for opportunism, as shown by Syria's tightening of its influence over Lebanon by driving the Christian general Michel Aoun from his redoubt over the weekend.
In grasping for a logical framework that explains the maze of developments that have upset what King Hussein of Jordan likes to refer to as ''the Arab order,'' intellectuals of the left and the right seem to agree on one thing: The chaos of today springs from an accumulation of unresolved political, economic and demographic problems that produced an Arab paralysis over the last decade. While the rest of the world moved on - ending the cold war, widening democracy, and undergoing a dynamic economic expansion in much of Asia, Western Europe and North America - the Arab world's problems festered, only to explode into the open with the Iraqi invasion, laying bare all the intertwined issues that cannot be remedied merely by an Iraqi departure from Kuwait.
''The Arab world was going through an oil hangover, an unprecedented economic recession, a frightening demographic explosion, a $300 billion foreign debt, the strengthening of authoritarian regimes, a deepening gap between rich and poor within each Arab country, and, more importantly, between the gulf area and the rest,'' says Ghassan Salameh, a Lebanese professor of political science at the Sorbonne. As a result, Mr. Salameh explains, the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait ''was instinctively viewed as a stone in the marshy waters of Arab politics, an act of will in times of lethargy, by those Algerians and Tunisians, Palestinian and Jordanians who spontanuously went into the streets.''
It is not so much that these masses admire Iraq's leader, Saddam Hussein, or that they wish to live under a regime like his, Mr. Salameh said in a recent conversation. ''They were longing for change, any change in the prevailing situation.'' But in the absence of Arab leadership that could inspire and direct this change in a peaceful way, the immediate result has been disarray across the Arab landscape and a chaos verging on war.
One salutary effect, however, has been a wave of self-criticism and introspection unmatched in this century, and many Arab intellectuals hope this may produce a brighter vision of the future. Since Iraq invaded Kuwait, there has been an avalanche of articles and commentaries that for once appear to place the blame for the Arab world's chaotic conditions on the Arabs themselves, instead of searching for conspiracies among Western imperialists or other outsiders. If a consensus is emerging it can be summed up as a general accord that Arab leaders have become bankrupt and that Arab ideological and political structures must be swept away to make room for a more realistic approach to the 21st century.
The Egyptian syndicated columnist Mahmoud al-Saadani expressed this sentiment recently. ''All Arab countries have neither a stable political logic nor an identifiable political creed,'' he wrote. ''They are more like a circus with no manager in charge. Sometimes they are moved by regional interests, sometimes class interests, or clan interests. In the end it is all a matter of crass interests and nothing else.''
A revolt against their governments and their condition has been under way for some time among all Arabs. Long before it was invaded by Iraq, Kuwait was in the throes of a debate about democracy, in which many Kuwaitis questioned the right of the ruling al-Sabah family to monopolize power. This debate has now resumed with fury here; hundreds of leading Kuwaiti figures came to this seaside city this weekend to examine their condition in exile, and many of them disregarded an appeal from their rulers that it would be better to talk about liberating Kuwait than about democratizing it.
''We think the time to talk about democracy is now while our Government is out of power and in exile,'' said Abdallah al-Nefeissy, a former member of the Kuwaiti Parliament. ''Later may be too late.''
Within the Palestinian movement, many questions are also being asked about the caliber of the leadership offered by Yasir Arafat, the Palestine Liberation Organization chairman whose vacillation between the positions taken by Arab militants and Arab moderates appears to have finally dented his reputation among Palestinians. His latest swing to support President Hussein has won him some support among the militant Palestinians, but it may have left his whole movement, and his leadership, in jeopardy regardless of the outcome of the crisis.
In Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Jordan and even in the gulf region, the passions inflamed by the crisis and the killings in Jerusalem have stripped away layers of fear and caution, opening the way for a muzzled press to touch upon subjects once taboo, ranging from corruption to the status of women in Arab societies.
In the whirlwind of passion that dominates this region, it is impossible to predict the outcome. Cynics say the area is bound to revert to an order that resembles the status quo ante, once Saddam Hussein is defeated. Revolutionaries say a firestorm of Islamic and Arab nationalist sentiment will devour the region, placing all Western interests in jeopardy and sweeping all moderate Arab governments aside.
Optimists see a possibility on the horizon for the international community, led by the United States, the Soviet Union and Western Europe, to move forcefully to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict, which has always found its way to the center of all Middle East crises. They also see a gradual movement toward more open government and greater democracy. For this latter group, as for the militants, there will always be linkage between the gulf crisis and the Palestinian issue, which both see as a time bomb threatening the whole region.
For the moment, the uncertainties and passions were summed by Mohammad Heikal, an author, former editor of the Egyptian daily Al Ahram and one of the most experienced Arab commentators on political affairs. ''I have never seen the Arab world more divided than it is now,'' he wrote in a recent article. ''There is much emotion and little clarity. The old order does not want to die and the future is refusing to be born.''

HEADLINE: TWO-FRONT CAMPAIGN;
In Budget Chaos, Democrats See Chance of 'Normal' Off-Year Victory

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
This campaign has been strangely episodic, as if some bored voter were zapping the remote control each time a plot line or theme emerged. There was the early positioning around abortion in the spring, the exchanges of accusations over the savings and loan scandal in early summer, the rallying 'round the flag as the Persian Gulf crisis erupted in August.
Now comes the chaos around the Federal budget, and to the horror of many candidates and strategists, there is little time left to change the channel. ''I've been in politics for 30 years and this is the strangest election cycle I've ever seen and the most unpredictable,'' said Ed Rollins, head of the National Republican Congressional Committee.
The impasse over the budget seems likely to feed the anger toward incumbents that polls have found among the voters this year, many analysts and politicians say. But many Democrats are hoping to gain partisan advantage from the White House's fumbling of budget negotiations last week, including President Bush's repeated reversals of position on the acceptability of higher income taxes on the wealthiest Americans in exchange for a cut in the capital-gains tax. And some Republican strategists privately worry that the Democrats' new optimism is justified. 
''We have now taken the leadership that the President refused to take,'' said Ronald H. Brown, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, in an interview on Friday, as House Democrats hailed a Ways and Means Committee plan that would sharply increase taxes on wealthy Americans. ''The way this has played out is clearly that the Republican Party favors the wealthy and the Democratic Party favors the average American,'' Mr. Brown added.
Charles Black, spokesman for the Republican National Committee, countered: ''That's wishful thinking. The voters are not following this blow by blow. They just see every night that there's gridlock and we're not getting the job done.''
Indeed, the New York Times/CBS News Poll this week found that almost two-thirds of Americans blamed the budget mess on both Congress and the White House. And many challengers are trying their best to capitalize on the voters' ill temper toward Capitol Hill and the unpleasant decisions that lawmakers face, from raising gasoline taxes to cutting Medicare benefits.
''Most challengers will simply bash the institution,'' said Representative Vic Fazio, vice chairman of the Democratic caucus in the House. ''If they're conservative they'll talk about no new taxes and if they're liberals they'll talk about no cuts in popular programs.'' In Nebraska, for example, Representative Peter Hoagland faces a challenge from Ally Milder, a Republican whose television commercials declare, ''If you think gas is high now, wait until Congress gets through with you.'' Her ad concludes: ''Let's replace the Congressman who spent us into this mess.''
There is much anxiety among incumbents, even though the House had a near-legendary re-election rate of 98 percent in the last two elections and members enter every race with huge advantages. Consigning the risky budget brinkmanship to the final days of a campaign does not make for easy stomachs. ''I don't think any of us have a very sure sense of how it will play out,'' said Mr. Hoagland, a narrowly elected freshman from Omaha. ''If we have another government shutdown next week because we're unable to resolve these differences, how that will affect incumbents, I don't know.''
The next critical deadline is Friday, when money for government spending runs out and Congress faces the prospect of passing another contentious temporary spending measure - known as a continuing resolution or C. R. - unless a budget resolution is reached.
''If the Democrats are able to pass a budget, we take off a lot of the criticism that Democrats can't govern and the ball is in the White House's court,'' said one House Democratic aide close to the negotiations. ''But there's no way we can go to another C. R. and not expect full-blown outrage from every corner in the country.''
The irritation level is already high. In follow-up interviews after last week's New York Times/CBS News Poll, Americans talked with disgust about Washington's inability to resolve the budget impasse. ''People in Congress give themselves pretty good raises, but they let civil service people hit the street, wondering where they'll get their next meal,'' said Larry F. Smith, a 29-year-old Navy maintenance technician in Norfolk, Va.
A 38-year-old bank worker in Wrightsville, Pa., who declined to give her name, said, ''There's too much fighting back and forth and no compromises. You've got to compromise somewhere. Someone's got to be taxed more.''
Despite their apprehension, many Democrats were delighted as the budget battle assumed more partisan lines. The budget agreement that went down to defeat 10 days ago had the fingerprints of both the White House and the Democratic Congressional leadership, infuriating many political professionals in both parties.
''Democratic members felt they got rolled,'' said one Democratic strategist, noting the plan's cuts in Medicare, increase in the gasoline tax, and what many Democrats saw as gentle treatment of the rich. ''They felt they were asked to go out and pass and defend a package that was fundamentally at odds with why they were Democrats.'' Republicans, for their part, were furious about blurring partisan lines on taxes, just when candidates around the country were campaigning on Bush's 1988 stance.
 
Seizing on 'Fairness'
 Last week, Democrats said they escalated a debate that will echo nicely on the campaign trail. It is old-time Democratic religion, presenting the party as the protector of senior citizens and working people, casting Mr. Bush and the Republicans as the tribunes of the wealthy. Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House Majority Leader, released a one-page statement on Democratic budget policy Friday that used the words ''fair'' or ''fairness'' seven times.
Representative Mike Synar, Democrat of Oklahoma, summed up the week's developments: ''This is the debate we've been wanting for 12 years.''
 
Back to Normal?
 The fairness argument, against the backdrop of an economic downturn, should force this campaign into the normal contours of a midterm election, many Democrats argue, which would be very good for the party outside the White House. The last time a President's party gained seats in a midterm election was in 1934 under President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
''All the recession fears are converging with the budget debacle to create a much more difficult situation for the Republicans and a much better political environment for the Democrats,'' said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic poll taker. Privately, some top Republican strategists agreed.
Still, many Democrats acknowledge that, as one strategist put it, ''We've done a better job at defining the Republicans than we have in defining ourselves.'' Moreover, nobody knows how this budget sequence will play out.
Some consultants say they are just steering clear of the whole mess. ''There's no way now to make a partisan spot on the deficit,'' said Bob Squier, who produces campaign ads for Democrats, ''Because between the time you wrote the spot, produced it an shipped it, you might have a change of events two times.'' It has been that kind of year in politics, a year of quick dissolves and shifting scenes, and it appears to be closing as it began.
Mr. Synar, the Oklahoma Democrat, said, ''This is this week's spin. Next week depends on what happens.''

HEADLINE: Two-Front Campaign;
For Mr. Bush, Holding Together Fragile Coalitions Is Getting Harder

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
George Bush doesn't much care for self-analysis - he said the other day he didn't want ''to get stretched out on the couch too far'' - but he admits that he likes foreign affairs much better than domestic policy.
He took pleasure, he said, in the challenge of the Persian Gulf, where he has had to ''put the coalition together and keep it together and work towards what I think is a proper end, seeing that aggression doesn't succeed.'' Whereas, he said, ''I can't say I just rejoice every time I go up and talk to Danny Rostenkowski, my dear friend, about what he's going to do.''
The irksome problem for Mr. Bush last week, this week, and for some time in the future is that he has to deal with both Saddam Hussein in the Middle East crisis and with Mr. Rostenkowski, the bluff and powerful chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, in the budget crisis, at the very same time. 
What's worse, both matters may be reaching a critical stage simultaneously.
The President has tried, and until recently had largely managed, to keep world attention focused on the need to force Mr. Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait. Day by day, the United States and its allies have increased the pressure on Baghdad, deepening the isolation of Mr. Hussein.
To help convince the Iraqi dictator of American determination, one American policymaker said, ''We have to show ourselves almost as monomaniacal as he is, so that he doesn't come to believe that we'll get distracted and lose our resolve.''
That is harder to do with the budget situation so intractable, and it is even harder to do when events, perhaps inevitably, conspire to drive the ad hoc Middle East coalition apart. The killing of at least 21 Palestinians by Israeli police officers was the kind of seemingly random event that exposes weaknesses and contradictions in a policy that were there all along, hidden from view.
The principal United States ally in the region is, of course, Israel, but that relationship has been fraying for some time - enough so that Washington, mindful of the need to keep Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Syria, among others, aligned against Iraq, was willing to take the lead for the first time in proposing a United Nations resolution critical of Israel. But the Palestinians, eager to regain the spotlight, and the Iraqis, eager to complicate Mr. Bush's job, combined to back a stronger resolution, which appealed to many Arab members of the coalition and even to the French.
So the President was obliged last week to turn his attention from the budget at a particularly nettlesome moment, in order to place a telephone call to Francois Mitterrand, the French President, to get him back on board. That helped set the stage for the compromise finally passed in the Security Council Friday, a resolution that condemned Israel in language the United States could join.
Cracks in the coalition, the Bush Administration believes, would be calamitous, not only because they would encourage Mr. Hussein to hold out but because they would cripple any hope for joint military action.
Already, analysts of the situation here at home see some signs of faltering; Barry Rubin of the Institute for Near East Policy in Washington said the other day, ''I wonder if the United States is losing control, drifting, uncertain of what it is going to do next.''
And on the potential killing field, in Saudi Arabia, the Egyptian and Syrian commanders told a Saudi newspaper that their role was largely to protect Saudi territory, not to drive Iraq out of Kuwait, as Mr. Bush has hinted he may try to do if the sanctions authorized by the United Nations do not work. Maj. Gen. Mohammed Ali Bilal, the Egyptian commander, said categorically, ''The Egyptian forces in Saudi Arabia will not participate in any offensive.''
 
A Delicate Task
So President Bush finds himself confronted with the immensely delicate task of maintaining links with the Israelis while at the same time appeasing Arab public opinion so that Arab backers of the United States cannot be made by Mr. Hussein to look like American stooges, and rallying the Arabs behind United States military leadership so that any armed thrust against Mr. Hussein does not look like Washington vs. Baghdad but like Baghdad vs. the world. If shooting starts, said Lawrence Korb of the Brookings Institution, who was a ranking official at the Pentagon during the Reagan Administration, pressures will mount on diffferent countries to act in different ways. ''What if the Saudi commander of Arab troops orders an attack on Kuwait, and Egypt just refuses?'' he asked.
It is the sort of irony especially familiar, perhaps, to students of the Middle East: Just as the United States troop level in the Middle East reaches the level where commanders would be reasonably comfortable with the idea of an attack, the political problems of mounting one are growing.
From President Bush's perspective, the budget problem affects all this in a number of ways. It is, of course, a distraction from his first priority - the gulf, the Americans held hostages in the area and the quarter-million American service personnel he has sent there. But it has also undercut his political standing at home, driving his approval rating in some polls to the lowest point of his Presidency and producing mocking comments on his leadership as his policy swings to and fro like a weathervane in a hurricane.
''The problem with this,'' said a Democratic senator who has been privately critical of his colleagues' attacks on Mr. Bush on the budget, ''is that it could give Saddam the idea that the President has lost the country's backing, and tempt him to conclude that he can now take big risks once again.''
But even more than that, Mr. Bush must worry that the budget mess, combined with the economic fallout of the Middle East stalemate, will send the American economy into free fall just in time to hurt his re-election chances. The plunging stock market, soaring oil prices, a stagnant real-estate market - even boarded-up shop windows along Connecticut Avenue in supposedly recession-proof Washington - are cause for concern to Presidential aides.
''Things will get a lot better once the budget deal is made and once the Israeli question fades,'' said a White House staff member, reflecting the conviction at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue that Mr. Bush is still on top of things. That may be, but he hardly seemed the commanding manager last week as he told reporters with forced jocularity while jogging, ''read my hips.'' And the things he is trying to manage are getting more complicated with each passing day.
Clearly, the biggest tests of the President's considerable diplomatic and strategic skills, and of his more frequently questioned wisdom and vision, lie down the road a bit.

HEADLINE: Q and A

BYLINE: By Terence P. Neilan

 BODY:

Horseback Riding in Japan
Q. I will be traveling to Japan next spring and would like to do some horseback riding while I am there. Can you help? - Kathryn Kimlin, Hoboken, N.J.
A. Riding is becoming increasingly popular among the Japanese as they seek to expand their leisure time, and there are two main areas of activity: family ranches and pensions.
Many of the ranches are situated in Nasu-kogen, an area near Nikko, in the Tochigi Prefecture, some 90 miles north of Tokyo. The ranches cater mainly to beginning riders. More experienced riders might be better served at pensions, which are small Western-style inns near tourist attractions and mountain resorts. Many, particularly those in the Japan Alps in the Nagano Prefecture, offer horseback riding. Sometimes the riding facilities are attached to the pensions; at others they are separate and are reached by bus or taxi. 
Pension Bashamichi, 331 Yamanaka, Yamanakako, Minami Tsuru-gun, Yamanashi, is near Mount Fuji and offers riding at $21 for 15 minutes and $36 for 30 minutes. Accommodations are $50 a night, including breakfast and dinner. El Patio, 2305-1 Sanno, Ichinomiya, Aso-gun, Kumamoto, is near Mount Aso on Kyushu, Japan's southernmost island. It offers riding at $21 for 15 minutes; accommodations are $86 a night, also with two meals.
Ten minutes by taxi from El Patio is the Greenvalley ranch, which offers riding at $36 an hour for men and, as a sales incentive, $29 an hour for women. A 20-minute lesson is $15. A half-hour from El Patio is Jyoba Kumiai, a ranch that offers riding from May to November at $18 for 20 minutes and $21 for 25 minutes.

Travel for the Elderly
Q. My mother is in her 70's and is looking for tours that are reasonably priced, provide at least two meals a day, are not too strenuous and might match her with a roommate. Is she asking for the impossible? - James H. Sugarman, Singer Island, Fla.
A. At least two companies specialize in group tours for travelers who are more mature in years, designing the vacations at a more leisurely pace and paying attention to such details as whether buses have a drop-down step and whether an individual's particular medical needs can be met. In addition, tours would not be booked into a hotel with noisy video games in the lounge, long stretches of stairs or a bar that plays loud music. But both companies stress that in general what is good for travelers in their 60's is usually good for travelers in their 30's or 40's, too. This would include elevators in all hotels, a hand-hold rail in the bath and a private bath in each room.
One company, Saga Holidays, sells some 200 international and domestic tour packages, including cruises, to clients over 60 years of age. It says the average tour price is $1,200 to $2,200 but that some start as low as $750. Groups usually number from 20 to 40 people. More information: Saga International Holidays, 120 Boylston Street, Boston, Mass. 02116; 617-451-6808 or 800-343-0273.
The other company, Grand Circle Travel, offers more than 100 tours, including cruises, for travelers over the age of 50 in the United States and abroad. It also offers a free booklet, ''Going Abroad: 101 Tips for Mature Travelers.'' More information: Grand Circle Travel, 347 Congress Street, Boston, Mass. 02210.
 
Studying Abroad
Q. Could you help me obtain a list of organizations that deal with programs for study abroad? - Veronica Ramos, Edison, N.J.
A. A comprehensive reference book on the subject, called ''Vacation Study Abroad,'' is published each year and describes some 1,400 programs, about 80 percent of them in Europe. Two-thirds of the programs listed are sponsored by colleges and universities in the United States, the rest by foreign universities and language schools. The guide is published by the Institute of International Education, best known for administering the Fulbright Fellowships. Courses vary in length from 3 or 4 to 12 weeks and in a few cases run 16 weeks.
The 1991 edition of ''Vacation Study Abroad'' will be published in December or January and can be ordered from I.I.E. Books, 809 United Nations Plaza, New York, N.Y. 10017; 212-984-5412. The guide, which will cost $26.95 plus $3 postage, will also be available in many reference libraries and the offices of foreign-study advisers on college campuses. This year's edition costs $24.95. Another of the institute's publications, ''Academic Year Abroad,'' gives details of about 1,900 programs, most of them sponsored by American schools. The courses generally run from from late September to early June. Next year's edition will be published in March and will cost $31.95.
The American Institute for Foreign Study is a private organization that has been offering programs for 27 years. Next year its courses will be held in 10 countries, including China and Australia, but a special emphasis will be placed on Eastern Europe. For the first time it will be offering a program in what until the reunification of the two Germanys on Oct. 3 was East Germany. A 16-week academic year program in the German language and culture will cost $6,995, including the one-way fare from the East Coast; all meals and accommodations are with local families. A four-week summer course in the same subject will cost $2,839. Courses will be held at Humboldt University, Berlin.
The 1991-92 catalogue is available free from the American Institute for Foreign Study, 102 Greenwich Avenue, Greenwich, Conn. 06830; 203-869-9090 or 800-727-2437.
 
Paris to Nice by Train
Q. My husband and I will be flying to Paris next summer on our way to pick up a cruise ship from Nice to Venice. What is the most economical way to get to Nice from Paris by train? - Carol McAllister, New York, N.Y.
A. The Flexipass sold by French Rail would seem to suit your needs. The pass, which allows four days of unlimited second-class rail travel in any 15-day period, will cost $119 next year. By comparison, a single one-way ticket in second class from Paris to Nice costs $127 this year, and is expected to cost $146 in 1991, according to a French Rail spokesman. Seven or eight trains a day leave the Gare de Lyon in Paris for Nice every day; the trip by T.G.V. takes about seven hours. More information: French Rail Inc., 610 Fifth Avenue, Suite 501, New York, N.Y. 10020, or Rail Europe at 800-345-1990.

HEADLINE: In U.S. Schools, A War of Words

BYLINE: By Richard Bernstein; Richard Bernstein is a national cultural correspondent for The New York Times.

 BODY:
In a well-worn classroom at the San Fernando Elementary School, 30 miles north of Los Angeles, Aracelis Tester, a second-grade teacher, is reading ''Cuidado, un Dinosaurio!'' - ''Watch Out, a Dinosaur!'' - with her diminutive pupils. This could just as well be Mexico City or San Salvador, Grenada or Seville: a roomful of Hispanic children and a Hispanic teacher speaking Spanish.
In downtown Los Angeles, at a school called the Wilton Place Elementary, Chan Hee Hong, a first-grade teacher, is talking in Korean with the children of recent immigrants about the wonderful world of frogs. There are public schools in Oklahoma where Cherokee is the language of instruction. In Astoria, Queens, Greek is taught in Public School 122; Haitian Creole is a language of instruction in some 20 public schools in Brooklyn and Queens; New York, in addition, offers schooling in Chinese, Korean, French, Italian, Russian, Vietnamese and Khmer. 
In the San Fernando Elementary School, the teaching of non-English-speaking children in their native language enjoys a virtually religious status: it is seen as a kind of panacea for the generally poor performance of Hispanic children in public schools. But at the Glenwood Elementary School in the San Fernando Valley, a neighborhood of neatly kept stucco homes festooned with bougainvillea, bilingual education is anathema. The Glenwood teachers often conduct classes in Spanish, since they are given no choice by the Los Angeles School District. The school, a political model for some, is notorious for others. Hispanic demonstrators shouting ''racist'' and carrying signs printed ''KKK'' have picketed outside the school, where teachers have been outspoken in their view that teaching children in Spanish is a fraud, a trick played by tendentious adult theoreticians on innocent children. They say that bilingual education is a failure, a tactic that in the end will harm the chances of generally poor, non-English-speaking children ever having an equal share in the promise of American life.
The San Fernando school and the Glenwood school represent the two poles of a debate, already 20 years old, that has lately become more acrimonious than ever. This is a nation that has successfully absorbed millions of immigrants without creating a huge bureaucracy or spending tens of millions of dollars to teach them in the languages of their ancestors. But in the last few years, teaching children ''Watch Out, a Dinosaur!'' in Spanish and talking to them about frogs in Korean has become a matter of deep importance to an ever-growing minority.
Part of the reason for this is that in America today more people speak foreign languages than ever before. Neighborhoods like those in the San Fernando Valley, whose residents were largely white and English-speaking 10 to 20 years ago, today have a Hispanic population of at least 90 percent. In Los Angeles, school-district officials say that there are, besides Spanish and English, seven other major languages being spoken in their district - Korean, Cantonese, Armenian, Vietnamese, Filipino, Farsi and Cambodian.
Why aren't these students being taught only in the language of their newly adopted land? One reason is that organized minority groups are demanding they be educated in their native language, and they have won allies within the local education establishments of quite a few cities. For many of these minorities, the subject evokes deep emotions. Advocates of bilingual education believe that it represents the best chance for non-English-speaking children - who, not so coincidentally, often come from the lower-income groups - to enjoy the richness and opportunities of American life. ''We have found a way to achieve educational parity and, by the way, to have people who are competent in two languages,'' said Raul Yzaguirre, the director of the National Council of La Raza in Washington, an umbrella group of several hundred Hispanic organizations.
This argument, once a minority position, has acquired a new ally in Washington. The Reagan Administration, with William J. Bennett as Secretary of Education, was at best ambivalent about bilingual education. Bennett spoke out strongly against the whole idea, believing that children who were taught in a foreign language were failing in school because of it.'' The revised bilingual-education act of 1988 allows for up to 25 percent of the bilingual-education budget to be spent on alternative teaching methods; that is, programs other than native-language instruction.
Now the Bush Administration has appointed an unequivocal advocate of bilingual education, Rita Esquivel, to take charge of Federal programs in the Department of Education. ''We on the Federal level like to leave it up to the districts to decide on their particular program,'' said Esquivel, the director of the Office of Bilingual Education and Minority Languages Affairs. ''But we certainly would like them to maintain their native languages. That's the President's point of view.''
If the forces in favor of bilingual education have gained an ally in the White House, there are still plenty of people on the other side of the issue, people who are convinced that teaching children in their native languages is bad, both for them and the country. Bilingual education, they argue, is more likely to prepare minority children for careers in the local Taco Bell than for medical school or nuclear physics. ''It doesn't work,'' said Sally Peterson, a teacher at the Glenwood School and the founder of Learning English Advocates Drive, or LEAD, a group of teachers and citizens that has quickly gathered adherents across the country. ''It seemed to make a lot of sense and I bought it at the beginning, but after a year or so I saw that children were languishing in the program.''
The other, more subterranean part of the argument is political. Ethnic pride is involved here on one side, a sense that what is sometimes called ''white, Anglo'' education is demeaning, psychologically harmful to minority groups. On the other side, there is a deep-seated worry that more is involved than an educational program to help minority students. The country is becoming far more ethnically diverse. Immigration is no longer the European affair it was during the first half of this century. Hundreds of thousands of people each year come from the Caribbean Islands, from the Middle East and from a dozen countries in Asia. In other words, just at a time when a more powerful glue is needed to hold the various parts of the society together, some critics see an ethnic and cultural assertiveness pushing it apart.
Bilingual education is only one element in this picture, its opponents believe, a reflection of intensifying demands within the schools for courses that represent the interests of particular ethnic constituencies. It's no longer enough for children to learn who George Washington was. They have to learn to feel good about their own heritage. The much-discussed ''Curriculum of Inclusion,'' produced by a special minority task force in New York State last year, argued that ''African-Americans, Asian-Americans, Puerto Ricans/Latinos and Native Americans have all been the victims of an intellectual and educational oppression that has characterized the culture and institutions of the United States and the European-American world for centuries.''
The solution, the task force concluded, was a new curriculum that, by concentrating on contributions by members of minority groups to the culture, would insure that minority children ''have higher self-esteem and self-respect, while children from European cultures will have a less arrogant perspective of being part of the group that has 'done it all.' ''
What's at stake, then, is nothing less than the cultural identity of the country. Those who argue that bilingual education is a right make up a kind of informal coalition with those who are pressing for changes in the way the United States is perceived - no longer as a primarily European entity to which all others have to adapt, but as a diverse collection of ethnic groups, each of which deserves more or less equal status and respect.
''Rather than see the United States as a melting pot, we like to think of it as a salad bowl, with equal recognition of everyone, and I think bilingual education is part of that,'' said Suzanne Ramos, a lawyer for the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, a group that has sued local school boards to force them to adopt native-language instruction for Hispanic youngsters. The fund's goal, she said, is to have Spanish-language instruction in conjunction with the teaching of English for Hispanic students through the 12th grade - in the fund's view, the best means of insuring that Hispanic culture is nurtured as part of the basic public-school routine.
''The disagreement is whether a child has a right to have his native language developed - not just maintained but developed,'' said James J. Lyons, the executive director of the National Association for Bilingual Education, a professional organization that drafted much of the Federal legislation on bilingual programs. ''There is a racist xenophobia about Spanish in particular.''
Those on the other side insist that diversity is all well and good; but they argue that bilingual education could lead to an erosion of the national unity, a fragmentation of the nation into mutually hostile groups. Leading the fight is a group called U.S. English, whose major objectives are to promote opportunities for people to learn English and to get a constitutional amendment adopted that would make English the official language of Government. Founded by former Senator S. I. Hayakawa and including such eminent figures as Saul Bellow, Barry Goldwater and Eugene McCarthy on its board of advisers, U.S. English has seen its membership swell to 400,000 in just seven years of existence. ''Language is so much a part of our lives that it can be a great tool either for unity or disunity,'' said Kathryn S. Bricker, the group's former executive director. ''And we are getting close to the point where we have a challenge to the common language that we share. Just look at what's going on in Miami, where a candidate to be school superintendent wanted everybody to have to learn Spanish.
''We are basically at a crossroads,'' she added. ''We can reaffirm our need for a common language or we can slowly go down the road of division along language lines.''
Bilingual education owes its beginnings less to classroom experience than to ethnic politics. The first bilingual classrooms in recent decades were established in Miami among Cuban refugees - specifically at the Coral Way Elementary School, where, as James Crawford, a former editor for Education Week reported in his book ''Bilingual Education: History Politics Theory and Practice,'' students were judged to be learning to ''operate effectively in two languages and two cultures.''
In 1968, Crawford reported, with the ethnic-consciousness movement picking up momentum, Congress passed the Bilingual Education Act, authorizing funds to give special help in educating children who did not speak English. Then, in 1970, a civil-rights lawyer in San Francisco, Edward Steinman, filed a suit on behalf of Kinney Lau and 1,789 other Chinese students who, he said, were failing in school because they could not understand the language of instruction. In a landmark ruling in 1974, the Supreme Court unanimously decided in favor of the Chinese students on the grounds that ''students who do not understand English are effectively foreclosed from any meaningful education.''
Neither the Supreme Court nor Congressional legislation required that special help for non-English-speaking students include instruction in their native languages. The motivation behind the suit was to obtain special help for these children so that they could learn English. But what is called Transitional Bilingual Education, the program to teach children in their native languages while they master English, was favored by various groups, including the Carter Administration's Department of Education. It was adopted by many school systems as the bilingual concept caught on - rather than the kind of all-English special help, generally called ''sheltered English,'' preferred by some teachers. Meanwhile, Hispanic groups became convinced that the use of Spanish in classrooms would help to overcome the difficulties Hispanic youngsters were experiencing in schools, giving them the second-highest dropout rate of any group in the country.
This does not mean that the Hispanic population is unanimous about the virtues of bilingual education. One celebrated dissenter is Richard Rodriguez, the Mexican-American writer, whose autobiography, ''Hunger of Memory,'' is a vivid portrait of the Hispanic experience. In one frequently quoted passage from his book, Rodriguez remembers how it felt when, for the first time, he found he could use English in school and be understood. ''The belief, the calming assurance that I belonged in public, had at last taken hold,'' he wrote. ''It would have pleased me to have my teachers speak to me in Spanish, but I would have delayed having to learn the language of public society.''
The Hispanic establishment tends to see the matter differently. Organizations like the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education Fund have brought class-action suits to force recalcitrant school districts to create bilingual programs. Raul Yzaguirre, the head of the National Council of La Raza, claims that bilingual education is the accepted means of reversing the traditionally poor performance of Hispanic students. He enumerates the reasons why these pupils need a kind of treatment that previous immigrants did not require. ''One factor is numbers,'' Yzaguirre said, referring to the large concentrations of Spanish-speaking people in certain areas of the country. ''There's a critical mass. Second, it's a group of people attached to a particular place. The U.S. came to them. They didn't come to the U.S., so the idea of coming to a new country and having to adapt to it is not part of the mentality of many Hispanics.
''Another reason is that it works. I was around when bilingual education was born. The impulse wasn't driven by any need to preserve language. It was driven by a yearning for solutions to help the most undereducated minority in this country.''
In a small, spartan office in downtown Los Angeles, Amelia McKenna, a former teacher who is now the assistant superintendent of the office of bilingual instruction, begins a brief in favor of bilingual education by exploding what she sees as some ''myths'' of yesteryear. Among them: that the old-fashioned teaching methods prevalent in the time of our grandparents worked so well that there is no reason to change them now.
''We don't know what the dropout rate was, but it was probably very high,'' McKenna says. The Los Angeles Unified School District where she works is the second largest in the country after New York, with some 600,000 students in more than 800 schools. ''But it wasn't noticeable then,'' she says, ''because the economy absorbed unskilled labor.'' Now the economy requires quality education for success.
There are 213,000 ''limited-English proficient students'' in the Los Angeles system, according to McKenna, using the standard bilingual-education term for students who need help in English. A year ago there were 184,000. ''With that number of kids, it's clear that we're growing drastically,'' McKenna says. ''And we're not going to be educating them for the 21st century if we just continue what we have been doing in the past.''
Those who need help fill up whole classrooms, whole buildings, McKenna maintains. There are many schools in the Los Angeles District that have a Hispanic enrollment of well over 90 percent. Students live in almost entirely Spanish environments, watching Spanish-language cable-television stations, speaking Spanish in the classroom, in the streets, in the home. Many of the ''limited English proficient'' students - or L.E.P.'s, as they are known - do badly; others, particularly those from Asia, do well, even without any remedial help. ''A lot of the Spanish children are refugees from Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala,'' McKenna points out. They are poor and do not have much of the preschool experience that will help them to meet the demands of early education. ''The Cantonese, the Koreans and the Armenians are more affluent,'' McKenna says.
At the Los Angeles School District, one of the books most commonly used for reference is a volume called ''Empowering Minority Students,'' written by Jim Cummins of the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education. Cummins's work, printed by the California Association for Bilingual Education, so well sums up the underlying issues of the debate that it is cited by both sides: one side uses it to show the theoretical justification for bilingual education, the other to prove bilingual education's ulterior political motives. Cummins raises all the themes of the bilingual argument: it endorses multiculturalism; criticizes what he calls the ''societal power structure'' of white, English-speaking America, and claims that native-language teaching is not just an educational device, but a blow against an inherent injustice.
''Empowering Minority Students'' does not argue that a child's inability to speak English is what leads him to fail if he is put into an English classroom. Children fail, Cummins says, because they are made to feel ''shame'' for belonging to a minority group, for not being a part of the ''dominant group.'' The only way to ''empower'' such children, he argues, is for teachers to ''consciously challenge the power structure both in their classrooms and schools and in the society at large.'' Bilingual education, he writes, is an ''empowerment pedagogy.'' It is an act of rebellion against white, Anglo domination.
Teachers in the Los Angeles system say Cummins's book is being taught in the special classes required for teachers to learn the bilingual-education methods. ''His ideas are accepted because they are useful to the bilingual-ed establishment,'' said Rosalie Pedalino Porter, a former educator from Massachusetts who has recently written a book, ''Forked Tongue,'' that chronicles her disillusionment with the bilingual-ed method. ''It's the old business of being a professional victim, of not admitting that anything good has ever been done for minorities. Otherwise you couldn't keep asking for special treatment.''
The idea of encouraging children who don't speak English to learn proficiency in their native language sounds like a plausible way to redress social inequality. But Porter is convinced that it could also have a negative effect. ''Before the utopia arrives,'' she said, ''and everyone has equal access, we are going to have generations of children who are going to be in tough shape if they're not able to use the language of the majority.''
She was alluding to a basic element of the bilingual debate that continues to swirl over the heads of some of the poorest and most disadvantaged children in the land, children who drift from one place to another, whose struggling parents cannot afford the luxury of reading them bedside stories, whose neighborhoods are often infested with gangs and drug dealers. ''Maintaining their language and their culture would be nice,'' Porter said, ''but it's not as important as helping them learn to succeed in American life.''
In a fifth-grade classroom at San Fernando Elementary School, Martha Ruiz, who is fluent in Spanish and English, sits at a low table with a group of a dozen or so little boys and girls, speaking to them only in English. She asks what a potion is, and a young girl with long hair and large black eyes replies in what sounds like perfectly mastered English: ''It's something that could change you into a frog or something.'' This class is the presumed end result of T.B.E. - Transitional Bilingual Education, in the pedagogic lexicon - and illustrates another tenet of the bilingual philosophy: that once basic skills have been mastered, children can make the transition from their native language to English without losing ground.
''Before,'' says Candida Fernandez-Ghoneim, San Fernando Elementary's principal, ''in most bilingual programs, the kids were put into English so quickly that third graders would be reading at kindergarten levels and the students' self-esteem was damaged. Now, we take the time to give the kids a real foundation, and they are really reading at their proper level. If they're depressed, if they don't feel good about themselves, they're not going to make it. But if they feel they're learning something, then you've won. Then they want to learn all by themselves.''
It seems to make sense; certainly it does at Fernandez-Ghoneim's school, which imparts a warm feeling to a visitor, a sense that the children of migrant families struggling economically are learning. But Sally Peterson's kindergarten class at Glenwood, where bilingual education is the enemy, also makes a favorable impression. The student constituency here is very similar to the one at San Fernando Elementary, with a high concentration of Hispanic children from migrant families; but Peterson concentrates on children whose parents have opted for virtually all-English instruction and she says that they are learning faster than the others.
Peterson and a junior colleague, Tracy Teitler, preside over 28 5- and 6-year olds sitting at two large tables in a gaily decorated classroom that has an air of controlled disorder about it. Hispanic children number about 20; there are a couple of Japanese; there is a Filipino; there are a few native English speakers. Over at San Fernando Elementary, they say that Sally Peterson is an advocate of what is pejoratively called ''sink or swim'' - just throwing foreign or Hispanic children into English-language classrooms and expecting them to absorb the language as if by magic.
Peterson replies that she gives special attention to the children who might have difficulty understanding English. You have to use drawings and act things out; you can speak a little Spanish here and there when it is necessary. You hug kids; you console them; you make sure that they understand what you tell them. Within about two years, she says, those who started out with no English master it very well, illustrating the near-miraculous speed with which children will learn the language of their environment.
The San Fernando School, one of seven model bilingual-education schools that have been created in Los Angeles (they are named Eastman Schools after the downtown school where the program was pioneered), has the resources to carry out a model program. But what about the other 830 schools in the Los Angeles School District? There, the results are not so promising, Peterson claims. The teachers themselves in many cases speak Spanish far better than English and the children thus end up in Spanish-speaking ghettos.
''I call it bilingualgate,'' Peterson says. ''The stated goal is to teach children English. At least, that's what they say. What they're not saying is that their agenda really calls for Spanish for as long as possible. It's because of the industry that has been created. It's because it's really a jobs program for Spanish-speaking teachers. The whole program actually punishes success, since those jobs and all those subsidies would be threatened if the children actually learned English.''
Among the subsidies in English cited by Peterson is a $5,000 bonus for teachers who are proficient in Spanish. No such bonus is available for any other type of special skill. In addition, there are local and Federal subsidies worth about $350 for each child in a bilingual class. ''If you're against them,'' Peterson says of the bilingual-ed establishment, ''they try to make it look as though you're anti-child. But the fact is that it's their industry that we are threatening.''
In his autobiography, ''A Margin of Hope,'' the critic Irving Howe, speaking about the ''ethnic'' generation of the 1920's and 1930's, recalls his hunger for school as a child of Jewish immigrants growing up in the Bronx; for Howe, mastering the English language was a badge of Americanness. ''The educational institutions of the city were still under the sway of a unified culture, that dominant 'Americanism' which some ethnic subcultures may have challenged a little, but which prudence and ambition persuaded them to submit to,'' he writes.
The question now is: What is the ''dominant Americanism''? Can there even be such a thing in a country committed to a kind of ethnic self-realization that did not exist when Howe was growing up? The answers will be hammered out in the years ahead in classrooms like Aracelis Tester's and Sally Peterson's, and they have to do with more than pedagogical philosophy. In the end, the way language is taught in this country will reflect where the country is going, its very identity.

DEATH SENTENCE
The Inside Story of the John List Murders.
By Joe Sharkey.
Illustrated. 305 pp. New York:
Signet. Paper, $4.95.
On Nov. 10, 1971, between 8:30 in the morning and 4 o'clock that afternoon, John List wiped out his entire family. Over breakfast, he shot his wife in the kitchen as she sipped her coffee and his mother while she stood by a toaster holding a plate with a pat of butter on it. Around noon, he picked up his 16-year-old daughter, Patricia, from school and shot her in the head. Then he took a shower, drove to town, withdrew his mother's savings from the bank and came home to ambush his two other children: Frederick, 13, and John Jr., 15. An economical man, John List knocked off four out of five of his kin using but a single shot each. Only John Jr. required extra bullets. ''John got hurt more,'' the boy's father explained in a confessional letter, ''because he seemed to struggle longer.'' Silly boy. 
As a genre, true crime usually means murder, most often among the middle class or the rich. John List was a bookkeeper. He lived in a house he couldn't afford in Westfield, N.J., a town that had not had a murder in eight years. What is enthralling about his story, though, is not who, how, how many or why he killed, but what he did after he quit murdering people.
Once he had arranged the bodies of his wife and children side by side in one room, Mr. List turned the central heating system down to a sensible 50 degrees - cool enough to preserve the bodies for a while, but warm enough to keep the pipes from bursting - wrote some confessional letters, switched on the radio so that classical music would fill the house and then drove to Kennedy Airport. He parked his car in the long-term parking lot, locked the keys inside the car and flew west. The bodies weren't discovered for a month. By that time, John List had vanished into thin mountain air.
He didn't get away with murder. After all, he had left behind letters announcing it was he who had done the deed. But he did get away. In Denver, the unburdened John List became Robert P. Clark, a fry cook with no past.
People who disappear usually turn up. They write home or return to their old habits. Mr. List did better than most fugitives, but in time he began to pine for a better job, more money and easier hours. People started to notice how much he talked about accounting. Eventually, Bob Clark fell in love, got married and went back to keeping books.
In 1989, 18 years after the murders, a sharp-eyed neighbor of Mr. List's saw a wax model of him on the television program ''America's Most Wanted,'' and called in to report him. The F.B.I. looked up Robert P. Clark. Discovering that he was a bookkeeper, the same age as List and educated in the same places, they knew they had their man.
In jail he explained his reason for the murders. Before he wiped out his family, Mr. List had been in all kinds of trouble, mostly financial. The bookkeeper could not tolerate such chaos, and so he wiped the slate clean, as methodically as if he were erasing a column of figures. He told a psychiatrist, ''There was no other solution. . . . I killed them all so that no one would survive. . . . It's like I had no control all the while I was doing it.'' ''Death Sentence'' is an original paperback, published fast and hard on the heels of John List's trial last May. (The jury found Mr. List guilty. The judge imposed the maximum sentence, life in prison times five.) As true crime, the book is O.K. The author Joe Sharkey is neither a particularly graceful writer nor a fabulously insightful one, but he gets the job done.
Here is what John List has to say about the coup he pulled off: ''I didn't really think I would get away with it for more than a week or two. . . . I decided to stay free as long as I could. I might have had it in my mind to turn myself in, but I never gave it serious consideration. I was afraid of the consequences. I was afraid I would go to jail for a long time.''
Well, yes.

 BODY:

WHISKEY RIVER
By Loren D. Estleman.
262 pp. New York:
Bantam Books. $17.95.
Loren D. Estleman is best known for his series of mysteries featuring the Detroit private investigator Amos Walker. His new book, ''Whiskey River,'' maintains the Detroit setting, ditches the private eye, slides the time back roughly 60 years and emerges as an enormously entertaining novel of life and death among the criminal element during Prohibition, when Detroit was America's gateway to Canadian spirits and Lake Erie was a free-trade zone for anyone with entrepreneurial instincts and a machine gun. 
''Whiskey River,'' the first volume of a projected trilogy, chronicles the short business life of a young bootlegger named Jack Dance as he slashes his way among the gangs and gangsters that controlled Detroit's politics and economics as a direct result of the 18th Amendment. But this is not so much Jack Dance's story as it is that of his chronicler, a cynical, disillusioned newspaper columnist named Connie Minor, whose vocational rise and fall nearly parallel that of Dance. Each man knows he is the key to the other's success, and each man exploits that fact in his own way. For Minor, who possesses the intelligence and experience that Dance lacks, the symbiosis is a reality never to be acknowledged. But as the charismatic young hoodlum steals, double-crosses and murders his way to fame and fortune, Connie Minor finds himself accompanying him every step of the way: first introducing Jack to the underworld, then observing his illegal activities, then actually and unwittingly participating in his schemes.
Playing off such historical events as the recall of Charles Bowles as Mayor of Detroit and the assassination of the controversial radio commentator Jerry Buckley, ''Whiskey River'' hurls the reader into the middle of the gang wars that raged from 1919 to 1939 among the legendary Purple Gang, the Little Jewish Navy and the Unione Siciliana, and introduces such colorful might-have-beens as the cheapskate multimillionaire Joey Machine and the mobster Frankie Orr, who makes an incomparable dinner companion:
''Frankie transferred his napkin to the table beside his plate. In almost the same motion, he picked up his steak knife and swept it backhanded across the top of Mr. Norman's collar.'' From his vantage point behind his London broil, Connie Minor watches as ''a bright orange arterial spurt arced past my head and thumped the door four feet behind me. The slash opened like a mouth without teeth, dyeing Mr. Norman's shirt, jacket, and tie deep scarlet. The blood covered his rack of lamb like thick marinade, welled over the edge of the plate, and fanned out across the tablecloth, making the white linen transparent as it advanced toward the corners.''
This is not a gratuitously violent scene. It is played out to its detailed conclusion, and it has a profound effect on the ''uninvolved'' and morally inert newsman.
At every opportunity, ''Whiskey River'' strives for authenticity. And the immediacy of its atmosphere never waivers as Mr. Estleman takes us along in Packards and Hornets driven by men in homburgs or fedoras who course through accurately named streets and neighborhoods to get to the ''blind pigs'' that abounded in the social life of the period.
Occasionally the details fail, as when Mr. Estleman attempts to relate the finer points of criminal litigation. But he does a marvelous job of setting clues, bringing seemingly loose ends together and surprising his readers, leaving them nearly incapable of stopping at the end of any given chapter. In all these regards, he shows the signs of a master craftsman.
To the extent that ''Whiskey River'' has a failing, it arises out of its own aspirations. The book has a feel, a structure, a protagonist that remind one of Robert Penn Warren's ''All the King's Men.'' The comparison is bound to be made, and yet ''Whiskey River'' is bound to suffer from it. Mr. Estleman's novel explores none of the rich enigmas of the human condition that make ''All the King's Men'' a classic. Nor is it as reflective or provocative as E. L. Doctorow's ''Billy Bathgate.'' Instead, the appeal of ''Whiskey River'' lies right on its surface. Like a good sculler, Mr. Estleman rows not deep, but with great pull.

HEADLINE: What's Happened to Heroes Is a Crime

BYLINE: By MARILYN STASIO; Marilyn Stasio writes the Crime column for The Book Review.

 BODY:
''All the heroes dyin' like flies / they say it's a sign a' the times.'' Sam Shepard wrote that dirge back when he was just a Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright, before he became a movie star and something of a popular hero himself. It is still my favorite word on the heroic condition, although from time to time someone will issue a snappy update on the subject. Russell Baker's recent comment, that ''heroes are pretty well all washed up in America these days,'' arose from his contemplation of the tarnished public image of Washington Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr., a man who the columnist said had terrific ''hero potential'' and blew it.
Looking back at the slippery ethics that determined so much of our national behavior in the past decade, we might well despair, with Mr. Baker and Mr. Shepard, of ever seeing another heroic character in our lifetime. Or we could read more mystery and crime fiction, which is virtually the last literary frontier for the American hero. It's a rough genre, this field that includes police procedurals and private-eye novels along with the more genteel amateur-detective story of ratiocination, so its male and female heroes are not always as shiny as their mythic models. 
''Knights had no meaning in this game,'' Raymond Chandler warned us, in ''The Big Sleep,'' about the type of hero who plies his trade in this sinister world where criminality reigns and virtue is for saps. ''It wasn't a game for knights.'' Indeed, even Chandler's own ''man of honor'' - still the prototype for the modern detective who would walk down these mean streets instead of crawling in the gutter - adheres to a code of behavior that plays fast and loose with the law. ''Their allegiance is not to the law,'' Robert B. Parker observed of Chandler's heroes, ''but to something else, call it order, a sense of the way things ought to be.''
Unlike the traditional hero of English detective fiction, a superior human being of flawless character, the postwar American detective does not assume that crime is an aberration in an otherwise benign and orderly universe. Because he embodies the laws of society, the traditional hero can restore order simply by enforcing those laws. To the modern detective, the law appears impotent, its minions often corrupt, and the universe in chaos. Consequently, readers of American genre literature expect the detective to be an honorable pragmatist, but not a saint or even a law-abiding citizen like the rest of us. We just want him or her to be the person who sees that something has gone badly wrong with the social structure and fixes it.
Chandler got it right again, in ''The Little Sister,'' when Philip Marlowe discovers his client standing over the body of her gangster-lover. ''You fix it, darling,'' she says, handing him the gun. That's all we ask, really, of the hero. To fix this mess we've made of our world.
Fixing messes used to be a lot easier. For a hero with a personal code of justice, right was right and wrong was wrong and that was that. More and more, though, we are watching fictional detectives struggle to maintain their own moral equilibrium, as unnerved as the rest of us by the erosion of systems and values that, however inadequate to contain evil, at least served to define it. Nowadays, when a museum director can be arrested for showing the work of a controversial artist and when savings and loan officers can get off with bilking the taxpayers of hundreds of billions of dollars, the ambiguity of what we call crime is killing.
''I'm not as quick to play God as I used to be,'' declares Lawrence Block's New York private eye, Matthew Scudder. ''Whether or not there's a God, it's beginning to dawn on me that I'm not Him.''
Scudder began his career as a casually corrupt but essentially decent cop with the New York Police Department. He quit the force after accidentally killing a child in the line of duty. The department gave him a commendation; Scudder's conscience gave him a hard time.
Other authors who have pulled their heroes off the force lately include Joseph Wambaugh, Thomas H. Cook and Stephen Solomita; better that than set them up for the worst-case scenario of Kim Wozencraft's ''Rush.'' In this first novel by a former Texas police officer, an idealistic rookie follows procedures for undercover narcotics work (''Be anything you have to be to make the case'') and degenerates into an amoral junkie and street hustler. ''We are the good guys. What we do is right,'' she reassures herself, as she crawls around the carpet sniffing up specks of cocaine. But is the hero any happier on his own? Despite the freedom to stand outside the system, be his own person and dispense his own justice, the unaffiliated private detective suffers his own kind of angst. Some of this comes with the job of being a solo (in the sense of socially disconnected) operator - the ''classless, restless man of American democracy,'' in Ross Macdonald's phrase. The deeper pain, though, is the detective's despair of having any real impact on crime and corruption. Consequently, you'll find many of these characters examining the validity of their own heroic identity.
''I'm not at all sure,'' Robert B. Parker stated in a 1985 interview, ''that in this brave new world of the 1980's a decent, honest, incorruptible, brave and loving man is not an anomaly.''
The dilemma that confounds Mr. Parker and other genre authors is how the hero can change with the times and still function as a hero, when ''the whole point'' of genre heroics, according to Chandler, ''is that the detective exists complete and entire and unchanged.'' Mr. Parker's own Boston private eye, Spenser, experienced a career crisis during the 1980's, when new detectives were entering the genre and he was no longer the smartest, toughest, most sensitive he-man in town.
Spenser tried being tougher. (''A Catskill Eagle,'' published in 1985, was bloodier than a Mad Max movie.) He tried being smarter. (''Crimson Joy,'' 1988, was awash in psychobabble about serial killers.) He tried leaving town. (In ''Taming a Sea-Horse,'' 1986, he shuttled from Boston to New York to Maine to St. Thomas and back to Boston, feeling out of sorts the whole time.) He tried rising above it all. (An unbecoming tone of smugness made its way into ''Pale Kings and Princes,'' 1987, and other books of this period.) Paradoxically, Mr. Parker finally pulled Spenser into the present last year by going back to his own genre roots and completing Raymond Chandler's ''Poodle Springs.'' In this good and faithful rendering of a Philip Marlowe story that Chandler had barely begun at the time of his death, Mr. Parker unequivocally accepts the hero's alienation. ''All I have is who I am,'' Marlowe states. ''If I change, I disappear, because there isn't anything but what I am.'' At the same time, he takes a stand on who he is (''your pal, your protector, your confidant'') and sets limits on what he can accomplish in an imperfect world. ''There are things I can do. I can shoot, I can keep my word, I can walk into dark narrow places. So I do them. I find work that fits what I do, and who I am.''
Mr. Parker puts these words into the mouth of another man's hero; but his own detective must have been listening. On the job again in ''Playmate'' (1989), rescuing a college athlete from the consequences of fooling with drugs, and in ''Stardust'' (1990), protecting a film star so willfully self-destructive that no one else has the patience or sympathy for her, Spenser seems reborn - no longer the aging, impotent knight, but a man who has once again found work that suits who he is and what he does.
On the other side of the room stands the hero least likely to lose any sleep over his failure to contain corruption in a decadent society - the detective who is himself a criminal. Nobody writes these characters with more gusto than Elmore Leonard.
''The typical hero, the guy who's almost invulnerable and an expert in nearly everything, is not interesting to me,'' Mr. Leonard once said. ''My guy on the other side of the law is a decent man. He's an ordinary person who is in some kind of a jam because of the way he is. . . . My guy, he's so unpredictable, he can solve the crime or he can commit it.''
Mr. Leonard's industrious criminals shouldn't be thought of as lacking morals or ethics. These working-class crooks do have their integrity; in fact, they try extra hard to play by the rules whenever they find themselves in an unfamiliar social setting. It's not their fault that they have such a tough time cracking the ambiguous behavioral codes of so-called honest society. Chili Palmer, the Mafia-connected Miami loan shark who is the hero of Mr. Leonard's ''Get Shorty'' (1990), can't even dope out the esthetics of Hollywood movie making.
''There aren't any rules. You know, anybody saying this's how you have to do it,'' Chili realizes, during an inspirational literary exchange with an even bigger crook than himself. ''You know what I'm saying? The movie business, you can do any . . . thing you want 'cause there's nobody in charge.''
In his way, Chili is saying that, in the country of the morally blind, the one-eyed crook can become a national hero.
Genre authors working the territory between Mr. Parker's romantic traditionalism and Mr. Leonard's cynical existentialism are finding other ways to legitimize their detectives in an age that has learned not to trust heroes.
Loren D. Estleman, who writes an admirable series around a hard-bitten Detroit shamus called Amos Walker, took the bold step of satirizing his own hero. In the broadly comic ''Peeper'' (1989), he introduced a private eye, Ralph Poteet, so crass and immoral that one reviewer called him ''Philip Marlowe's evil twin.'' His current novel, ''Whiskey River'' (reviewed on page 50), is the first in a projected historical trilogy set in Prohibition-era Detroit, a time and a place of simpler, less equivocal crime philosophies.
Other authors have chosen to investigate the personal lives of their detectives, a tactic that can either humanize these heroes or lead to vapid confidences about their pets and lovers. Matthew Scudder's never-ending battle with the bottle proves more than a convenient device for Lawrence Block to get his series hero into atmospheric bars where he can chat up the colorful lowlife from Hell's Kitchen. In ''A Ticket to the Boneyard'' (1990), for instance, Scudder's fear of losing control over his drinking problem reflects the futility he feels about his efforts to stop a serial killer.
''Take away the problem,'' Mr. Block has said about Scudder's alcoholism, and ''you take away a dimension of his character.''
A case might also be made for Kinsey Millhone's acquisition of a boyfriend in '' 'G' Is for Gumshoe'' (1990), the most recent of Sue Grafton's alphabetized mysteries. Ms. Grafton's California private eye has a no-nonsense style and an independent spirit that could easily be compromised if she sets up housekeeping in earnest. But domestic relationships are central to this author's plots, which often require her detective to solve crimes by sorting out tense family relationships, especially between fathers and their children. In '' 'F' Is for Fugitive'' (1989), she works the theme into a murder plot about a young woman who attracts older men. Under the circumstances, it should be interesting to see how a man in Kinsey's life might affect Kinsey's ability to resolve the psychosexual conflicts that often motivate the crimes she investigates.
If it's just a matter of staying on the ball, the genre hero has plenty of resources. Police detectives can turn to the new technologies to keep their procedures up to date. Regional detectives can investigate the more sophisticated forms of wickedness spreading to their towns. Private detectives can always find fresh hell on the city's streets. As for the amateur sleuths, so many of them hold down day jobs nowadays - from antiques dealing to horse playing - that their specialty fields can provide endless inspiration.
But the heroes with more important things on their minds - like how to move with the times without losing their inner direction - must have the vision to place the crimes they investigate into a social context, so they can be viewed in the broadest human terms. These are the detectives admired by Ross Macdonald for ''their intelligent humaneness, an interest in other people transcending their interest in themselves, and a toughness of mind which enables them to face human weaknesses, including their own.'' The heroes people remember best are the ones who themselves remember that their job is to look after other people.
Sara Paretsky's Chicago private eye, V. I. Warshawski, brings such a perspective to the white-collar crimes she investigates and evaluates in terms of the people who are left homeless by these crimes, the workers who are thrown out of jobs, the honest citizens who lose heart. So does K. C. Constantine's Mario Balzic, the gruff and compassionate chief of police who bleeds for his economically depressed working-class burg of Rocksburg, Pa. And so does Walter Mosley's new private eye, Easy Rawlins, when he listens with sympathy to the old barbers and bartenders telling their stories in a Los Angeles ghetto.
There are so many people to help in the Navajo and Hopi territory of the Southwest where Tony Hillerman sets his novels that the job takes two detectives, each with his own vision. There's Joe Leaphorn, the father figure: ''He's sort of our supercop. Old as the hills. Knows everybody. Remembers everything. Forgets nothing.'' And Jim Chee, a mystic and the Christ figure of the series: ''He would learn the great curing ways, the songs and the sand paintings, and become a [shaman] for his people.'' Between the two of them, they would not only understand the evil forces infecting their culture, they would heal the people and cleanse the nation.
The times may be hard, but in detective fiction at least, they still breed heroes who fix those lives that criminal mischief has undone, and who have the compassion to rage or weep over the deeper human outrages that are beyond their power. Unlike the mythic giants from whom they trace their ancestry, these modern models don't kid themselves that they can restore order to an ungovernable universe. But they are bona fide heroes nonetheless and they do bring a little Promethean fire to mankind - even when it costs them their livers.

THE MURDERER NEXT DOOR
By Rafael Yglesias.
282 pp. New York:
Crown Publishers. $19.95.
Molly, a young lawyer, is married to Stefan Weinstein, a successful psychiatrist. They live in a handsome prewar co-op on lower Fifth Avenue. Across the hall live Ben Fliess and his daughter, Naomi. Wendy, Ben's wife, Naomi's mother and for years Molly's best friend, is dead. Ben crushed her skull in after an argument at their weekend place in the Berkshires and tossed her body in a dumpster in the parking lot of a shopping mall. He was arrested soon thereafter. 
He's out on bail awaiting trial and, though charged with murdering his wife, under New York law he has custody of 6-year-old Naomi.
Provoked by the bizarre case of Joseph Pikul, who was convicted of murdering his wife in 1987, Rafael Yglesias' sixth novel is a truly compelling tale of love, hate and moral ambiguity in contemporary New York City.
Emotionally cauterized by her own unhappy past as an abused child in rural Maine, Molly had immersed herself in the lives of Wendy and then Naomi. Repelled by the hateful Ben and enraged by his treatment of Wendy, it was Molly who discovered his bizarre other existence. Ben is a cross-dresser, with a separate apartment where he wears women's clothes. In trying to warn Wendy, Molly succeeded only in getting her killed.
To cope with her guilt, she plans to try to gain custody of Naomi before Ben is convicted and imprisoned and the child is claimed by an unsavory cousin of Ben's in Queens. Molly knows that she must gain Ben's favor to get him to relinquish the little girl. Stifling her revulsion, she begins to cultivate him. And a strange thing happens. Eerily, implacably, as one might be mesmerized by a weaving, deadly reptile, she finds herself attracted to him.
Mr. Yglesias is a talented young novelist who wrote his first book when he was 16 years old. His setting here, as in his novels ''Only Children'' and ''Hot Properties,'' is contemporary New York. Unlike many writers who use the city as their backdrop, he refuses to confine himself to a class - the Upper East Side rich, for example - or a clique - the fashion crowd, artists, intellectuals. To borrow a label from another form, he's a general-assignment novelist, ready to savor the city in all its diversity.
Like Woody Allen in the best of his films, Mr. Yglesias has an ear for the nuance that makes the New York setting unmistakable:
''Ben earned a scholarship to Cornell, majored in economics, and ended up on Wall Street as a securities analyst. He should have been living in the suburbs, I suppose, already married, but he had been detoured - like the rest of us - by the sixties, by drugs, and thus become hopelessly trendy in an effort to avoid his parents' trends.'' And then there's the New York dialogue: '' 'I'm sorry, Stefan, I love you, but you're a doctor, you think everyone can be cured. You think deep down everyone's good.'
'' 'Molly.' He was soft-spoken and gentle, although the wound in his eyes had not healed. 'I know you've done your best to learn nothing about psychoanalytic theory, but you should know that, if anything, just the opposite is true of a Freudian.'
''Condescension is the worst insult to a yellow-haired lobsterman's daughter. 'This isn't an exchange of letters in the New York Review of Books, Stefan. These are people's lives. You've had a lot of opinions about all this, and you haven't been right once.' ''
There are no heroes in Mr. Yglesias' story. Ben is a murderer, a fetishist, a manipulative monster. Stefan sees problems to be solved, never pain to be assuaged. Molly is driven by demons she can't recognize, much less control.
Wendy is the victim of record, but she is hardly the only victim. At the end of the story there is some peace - but little happiness. Lives have been stripped bare, dissected. Yet there's no indication that anyone has really changed. And isn't that the way it really is? ''The Murderer Next Door'' is a disturbing and quite powerful novel.
 
DADDY WORE MAKEUP
 For two weeks I came and went from our apartment without explanation to Stefan, who, wary of me, asked for none. I went to the office, worked through lunch (billable hours were now important in a way they had never been), got Naomi from school, brought her home to a sullen, rather beery Ben, chatted idly like a housewife while I made dinner, supervised homework, hygiene, and faced the thorny problem of Naomi's social life, in particular her upcoming birthday.
Feeling a bit foolish I bought a paperback on good parental manners and discovered that the rule of thumb is: invite as many children as the number of the birthday. Wendy must have ignored this convention - Naomi was going to be seven and there had been more than six children at her previous celebration.
I raised this question with Ben one night after reading Naomi her bedtime story. She still liked to be read to even though of course she was one of the best readers in her class. I left her finishing the chapter on her own, came out of her room, and found Ben in the kitchen, loading the dishwasher. ''Birthday party? Hadn't thought about it,'' he said. His big head glowed under a harsh neon light shed by an ugly kitchen fixture - periodically Wendy had wished she had the money and time to replace it. In the glare his thick skin seemed smoother and darker. Squinting, I fancied I detected a hint of makeup. He watched my eyes study him. He was ashamed of my observation so I must have been correct. Head down, he slunk away in a slow shuffle, like a scolded dog.
Why didn't Ben tell Wendy about dressing up earlier? I wondered. And why did she insist he surrender the Battery Park apartment with its secret wardrobe? What difference does it make if he wants to put on pancake and blush?
From ''The Murderer Next Door.''

ANCHORS
Brokaw, Jennings, Rather and the Evening News.
By Robert Goldberg and Gerald Jay Goldberg.
Illustrated. 399 pp. New York:
Birch Lane Press/Carol Publishing Group. $19.95.
Do you want to know what makes Tom Brokaw, Peter Jennings and Dan Rather tick? Do you want to know how they got to the pinnacle of their profession? Do you want to know what it takes to get an evening news show on the air on deadline? If so, ''Anchors,'' written by a father-son team (the father, Gerald Jay Goldberg, is a professor of English at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the son, Robert Goldberg, is the television critic of The Wall Street Journal), is the book for you. 
The book is also worth the price of admission for its dramatic accounts of Mr. Rather at Tiananmen Square last year and Mr. Brokaw on the spot as the Berlin wall came tumbling down. One cannot help being thrilled by the author's account of Mr. Rather's sheer physical courage in going back to Tiananmen Square after Chinese officials closed down his live coverage of the student demonstrations. At 1 o'clock in the morning, in spite of a curfew and in spite of an anticipated crackdown by the Government, Mr. Rather returned to capture the event on tape and, the authors say correctly, ''as a consequence, [the students'] heroic deaths and their innocently idealistic message of political change had repercussions all around the globe, from Eastern Europe to Nicaragua.''
Again, ''Anchors'' comes alive as it describes Mr. Brokaw's newscast that began with the words ''Live from the Berlin Wall on the most historic night in this wall's history'' and the sight of thousands of happy East Germans streaming through the gate and tearing down the wall.
But, alas, there is heavy slogging through Mr. Brokaw's hometown, Yankton, S.D., to get to Berlin. As chroniclers of small-town life the writers are not William Faulkner.
It should get better after Mr. Brokaw breaks out of Yankton, but it doesn't. From Nebraska to Atlanta to Los Angeles, it's dull, dull, dull. An absolute paroxysm of dreariness produces the following anecdote from Mr. Brokaw's Los Angeles days: ''Dick Wald, the president of NBC News at the time, flew to the West Coast to look him over. Brokaw took him to a vegetarian restaurant called the Aware Inn, one of those health food places in Los Angeles with plants hanging down from the ceiling - the foliage dense as the Mato Grosso - and sprouts sprinkled on everything. And then, according to Wald, 'this nice young man started talking California politics, the national economy, the environmental movement, and so on, and it was apparent that here was not just someone who was good on the air, but a fellow with a good head on his shoulders.' '' Believe me, this is as exciting as the authors' account of Mr. Brokaw's early life gets.
Dan Rather's beginnings in Wharton, Tex., as depicted by the authors, are only a shade more interesting than Mr. Brokaw's. Both came from blue-collar backgrounds and both raised themselves to the top by sheer energy and ingenuity. Peter Jennings, in contrast, had it all and, for a time in his late adolescence, threw it all away. His father was a famous figure in the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and had come to be known as the ''Edward R. Murrow of Canada.'' The Jennings household was frequented by all the fascinating artists and statesmen who came through Toronto. But young Jennings dropped out of an exclusive private school and then out of a public high school.
His family sent him, at the age of 17, to a place where black-sheep sons were sent in Toronto: a bank. He lasted three years there, then went into his father's profession. Barred from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation because of an antinepotism rule, Mr. Jennings earned his spurs at a tiny, weak-signaled radio station in the tiny town of Brockville, Ontario. ''He was, in short, a one-man radio band, hosting everything from the news to the late night 'Moods and Music' to a Saturday-morning gospel hour,'' the authors write.
By 1961, Mr. Jennings had made the jump from radio to television. He was working at a station in Ottawa when he was discovered by John Scali of ABC, and the rest, as they say, is history.
Those interested in a career in television or those fascinated by trivia as well as the medium's more important moments may enjoy this book. It would be a good idea, however, to read ''Anchors'' before the increasing numbers of viewers fleeing the evening news render anchormen obsolete. The authors' solution to this problem is not to get rid of the evening news but to slow it down. They would have the first third of the 22-minute broadcast remain the same - that is, midget messages for midget minds (my phrase, not theirs) - and then devote the last two-thirds to in-depth coverage of one or several of those stories. Presumably the larger brains among us would sit still for this. As an example of what has not been covered in this way but should be, the authors mention the savings and loan scandals. While I agree it is just terrible that the American people have not had conveyed to them ''the dimensions of the Savings and Loan debacle,'' unlike the Goldbergs I do not think television is the medium that can explain such complexities. It is a medium designed for short attention spans. While the authors mention the competition of the Cable News Network's daylong newscasts, they do not seem to understand that people don't want to be tied down to 6:30 or 7 P.M. They have been irrevocably spoiled by CNN, by their time-shifting videocassette recorders and by the sameness of all three network news programs, give or take a personality or two.
I, for one, solve the whole problem by listening to the news on National Public Radio.

WARRENPOINT
By Denis Donoghue.
Illustrated. 194 pp. New York:
Alfred A. Knopf. $19.95.
Warrenpoint is the name of the seaside town in Northern Ireland where Denis Donoghue spent his childhood. To use the name of one's hometown as a title for an autobiography is an odd thing to do - as if John Updike had called his memoirs ''Shillington,'' or Philip Roth had written ''Newark.'' In fact, Mr. Donoghue has taken pains to avoid the familiar sort of autobiographical narrative in which childhood is revisited, sights and sounds are lovingly dredged up from memory and various colorful characters appear on stage to delight or terrify the young hero. The warmth that customarily suffuses such books is notably absent from ''Warrenpoint,'' whose tone is cool, even severe, toward the life it contemplates and aspires to measure with unillusioned eyes. 
From the beginning of his career as a literary critic, Mr. Donoghue has been a keen analyst of style. One of his best books, ''Jonathan Swift'' (1969), is full of acute descriptions of Swift's sentences and paragraphs; more recently, in ''Ferocious Alphabets'' (1981), the styles of a number of contemporary critics and theorists are perspicaciously examined. In ''Ferocious Alphabets,'' as in all of Mr. Donoghue's books, the assumption is that style is a compensation ''for defects in the conditions of writing, with the first defect, that it is writing and not speech''; thus a writer's chosen style is a strategy used to ''make up for the situation.'' Mr. Donoghue's own situation is that of someone who was raised a Roman Catholic in Protestant Ulster, who presently lives part of the year in Dublin and who holds the Henry James Chair of English and American Letters at New York University - a complex fate, to say the least, and in need of a suitably complex style to express it.
We may partially describe that style by noting what it steers away from. Apropos of his studying the violin as a child (there are a number of interesting observations about music in ''Warrenpoint''), Mr. Donoghue tells us that early along he developed ''a scruple about vibrato,'' thinking it ''an effeminate habit,'' and that even though he now knows better, he persists in hearing it as a sign of Romanticism's hymn to the free, mobile sensibility - and thus as something to be resisted: ''If Shelley's 'Ode to the West Wind' were music, you would play it with a lot of vibrato. One point I am sure of: if my father had played the violin, he would not have used vibrato.'' Mention of Denis Donoghue Sr. is wholly germane at this moment of truth, since he - not Warrenpoint and certainly not the son - is the real hero of this book.
Mr. Donoghue's father was a policeman, first in the Royal Irish Constabulary and later, after the division of Ireland in 1920, in the Royal Ulster Constabulary, until he retired in 1946 - at which point the narrative ends. He was also a man who mended his children's shoes, and a description of his performance of that task brings to mind Walter Morel's skills as a cobbler and mender in Lawrence's ''Sons and Lovers.'' Police Sergeant Donoghue was a man who insisted that his son walk ''like an officer,'' head high, no hands in the pockets; he was as ''straight'' in his upright posture as in his moral dealings, though his son notes that ''straight also means unbending, inflexible, unambiguous.'' But the son finds no ambiguity in his feelings about the father: indeed, Mr. Donoghue has harsh words (it is good to hear them) for the ''mischief'' Freud has caused with his insistence that boys grow into manhood only by ''killing'' or displacing their fathers. By contrast, this particular boy felt that his father was ''not only a strong man but the source of strength for me,'' a strength to be developed not by conflict but by example: ''My father filled all the space. . . . I needed from [him] only what he gave me. The rest I could imagine, or find elsewhere, or do without.''
More than once, Mr. Donoghue makes explicit the connection between his father and his own ambitions as a writer. Although as a youth it never occurred to him to attempt a poem or a story, expository prose seemed a possible mode of activity: ''Surely I could write an essay by putting one decent sentence after another one of much the same character, and send them walking forth as my father put one foot after another and walked handsomely.'' Perhaps so, yet it won't do to characterize the style of ''Warrenpoint'' as straightforward or without guile. At least something like guile is involved in the way - so as to avoid writing with a lot of vibrato - Mr. Donoghue strategically denies himself any extraordinary or specially endearing qualities.
His childhood, he tells us, was neither happy nor unhappy; he had a poor sense of smell; he's not sure he remembers exactly the kitchen of the house where he grew up; he was much too tall, no good at games (unlike his brother, Tim, who starred at them) and failed to learn to swim; he admits readily to cutting ''a poor enough figure . . . in many of the episodes I recall.'' He asks, ''When have I ever been heroic?'' - but does not stay for an answer. He can't even remember the plots of novels, has never ''told any of my children a story or read to them a chapter of a novel.'' Opera means nothing to him, oratorios are alien (since, he says, most of them are Protestant) and - here the indictment comes close to the comic - he has ''only once, and recently, seen The Wizard of Oz.'' ''What am I preserving my gravitas for?'' he wonders in a fit of mock-heroic soul-searching.
Such denials and demurrings and mild self-lacerations are really part of a cagey refusal to write some fluid, too-easy success story about how the lad from Warrenpoint grew into a distinguished international scholar and critic. ''My talents are such as to express themselves in circumspection,'' he writes, and this book cultivates discontinuity as well by breaking its narrative into short sections and by effecting sudden leaps and changes in tonality from one section to the next. Furthermore, particular remembered experiences are insistently turned toward the general and speculative, with a heavy use of big-name speculators in Western civilization: from Augustine and Leibniz to Pater and Freud, to Roland Barthes and Susanne Langer and Walter Benjamin.
Only when the air has thus been made ''thoroughly small and dry'' (a phrase from Eliot's ''Ash-Wednesday,'' which Mr. Donoghue does not quote) will the sentences seem to march with requisite character. Mr. Donoghue describes himself as having always been an ''opportunistic'' reader, ever ''on the lookout for phrases, as if I lived for the opportunity of using them.'' Impressive as is the parade of writers he calls up to testify on various subjects, one wishes occasionally that the opportunity might have been refused and the autobiographer been content to relax a bit within the precincts of his own lively mind.
In one of the book's more incisive self-characterizations, Mr. Donoghue writes, ''When I think of my early years, I find myself always in relation to something I revered precisely because its existence and force were independent of my will. . . . Mine was the intelligence that comes after.'' The real action of ''Warrenpoint'' lies not in what the young Denis Donoghue did or (more likely) didn't do, but in the intelligence and boldness with which connections are made by the writer's imagination. This boldness is particularly apparent late in the book, when Mr. Donoghue's reflections on the question of a divided Ireland come together with ones about his father.
With bracing asperity and evident distaste, he rejects ''revisionist'' versions of Irish history that would ''remove . . . the glamour of its sacrifices and martyrdoms'' in the interests of social and economic history. He remarks, mordantly, that ''unfortunately, Ireland without its story is merely a member of the EC, the begging bowl our symbol.'' In an even more wryly withering vein, he says about Conor Cruise O'Brien's repudiation of Irish nationalism, ''Nationalism is a fine flower, so long as it grows in Israel, Tibet, Poland, and Lithuania.'' The autobiographer is no more concerned to present Ireland with a better version of itself than to repudiate or correct his father's character. If, as Mr. Donoghue writes, he needed from his father only what that father gave him, the same can be said about his country. This is a style of accounting not to be easily dismissed, and it gives ''Warrenpoint'' force and a stubborn integrity.

A CITY OF STRANGERS
By Robert Barnard.
287 pp. New York:
Charles Scribner's Sons. $18.95.
How do you make a murder mystery merry? After all, death by violence is hardly an inherently cheerful topic. Yet from G. K. Chesterton onward, gifted mystery writers (English ones especially) have found ways to bring a genial, even jovial spirit to tales of homicide. One favorite way: make the murder victim as thoroughly loathsome, as unredeemably toxic, as possible - someone, that is, who's virtually begging to be done in. Not only does this remove any hint of tragedy from the central demise, it also guarantees an abundance of likely suspects and juicy motives, since such a vile specimen is sure to have a long list of well-earned enemies. 
Robert Barnard, the most reliable and versatile practitioner of English mystery-comedy on the present scene, is a virtuoso when it comes to this man (or woman)-you-love-to-hate technique. ''Death of a Perfect Mother'' (1981) featured the perfectly hateful Lill Hodsden, whose children were only some of the people with good reason to wish her dead. The title character in ''Death of a Mystery Writer'' (1979), the bullying Sir Oliver Fairleigh-Stubbs, deserved everything he got.
And now ''A City of Strangers,'' notwithstanding its somber title and its often stark details, presents Mr. Barnard's most exuberantly nasty corpse-to-be thus far. Meet Jack Phelan, the scourge of the Belfield Grove Estate, a working-class development in the bleak suburbs of a contemporary Yorkshire city called Sleate. (Mr. Barnard lives in a contemporary Yorkshire city called Leeds.) A father of six, contentedly unemployed for nearly 20 years, filthy Jack spends his days guzzling beer, insulting the neighbors, picking fights, breaking furniture, hurting people whenever the opportunity arises - ''like a football hooligan grown up.'' (Says the widow next door: ''He never changed, only . . . ripened, you might say.'') He resents having to send his children to school, however briefly. The vicious Phelan teen-agers, Kevin and June, are already hardened criminals; the younger kids, with one miraculous exception, are precociously depraved. When the family descends on a local supermarket, the townsfolk scatter:
''There were five of them going the rounds of the aisles: the parents, June, Jackie, and Dale. Dale's push-chair and the supermarket trolley made them a formidable group to encounter - practically an armored battalion. Jack pushed the trolley aggressively, shouted instructions, got out of no one's way, cursed old ladies who were peering at prices to save a penny or two on a packet of teabags, and abused one of the shelf-boys who happened to be black. 'I wouldn't go to a Paki shop and I don't expect to see the buggers here,' he shouted ostensibly to his wife, really to all and sundry, and the black youth in particular, who was in fact Caribbean.''
Imagine the uproar, then, when rumors begin circulating that Jack Phelan has won a fortune ''on the pools'' - and intends to move self and family up the road to quiet, lovely, fiercely middle-class Wynton Lane, where one of the splendid late-Victorian houses is up for sale. Jack, a compulsive mischief-maker, revels in the shock and dismay, the fury, of Wynton Lane's current residents. So does Mr. Barnard, who sketches in the five very different white-collar households involved - hotbeds of neurosis and genteel hypocrisy - with a droll shrewdness and ruthless economy that are reminiscent of Agatha Christie at her very best. (Mr. Barnard's critical study of Christie, ''A Talent to Deceive,'' pays tribute to her underappreciated flair for social comedy.) But though the Wynton Lane dwellers band together in a not-in-my-backyard frenzy, they soon realize that they're powerless to prevent the infamous Phelans (who show up in all their slovenly, derisive glory to ''view'' the property) from buying anything they can afford - which means that when the Phelans' old house is torched, with paterfamilias Jack the sole fatality, Superintendent Mike Oddie has no shortage of possible candidates for the role of arsonist. Up on Wynton Lane there are all those respectable but highly motivated homeowners - including such improbable prospects as Mrs. Rosamund Eastlake, a longtime invalid obsessed with the retired school principal Daphne Bridewell. There are also, given Jack's personality (and his supposed recent windfall), more than a few questions to put to the not-so-grieving widow and other family members.
Of course, mystery writers who make jolly good use of the monstrous-victim gambit do inevitably encounter one potential drawback. Their most colorful character disappears - permanently - somewhere in the book's first half, and there's always a risk that things may pale noticeably thereafter.
Mr. Barnard, however, canny pro that he is, more than compensates his readers for the loss of Jack Phelan's entertainingly abominable, almost Dickensian presence. In the novel's second half, he sustains the Phelan flavor by shifting attention to the appalling son Kevin, who terrorizes minority merchants, and his sister June, a blase, small-time tart; they, together with parents and siblings, ultimately become a convincing microcosm of Thatcherite Britain's new underclass -''riotous, savage, with nothing to lose.''
At the same time, Mr. Barnard deepens his wry portraits of the nervous householders, developing a few of them - studies in hypochondria, sexual repression and male complacency - into tidy, satisfying subplots. (The standout: Mrs. Eastlake, who, roused from her sickbed by the invigorating anti-Phelan fuss, reinvents herself.) And Superintendent Oddie's low-key yet firmly paced sleuthing leads, by way of some bona fide Christie-like twists, to the surprise unmasking of the killer: a monster, no less so than Jack Phelan, but one of a distinctly less amusing sort.
In the end, in fact, ''A City of Strangers'' turns out to be not quite so merry after all. Having lured us in and cozied us up with Jack Phelan's extravagant (though never cartoonish) awfulness, Mr. Barnard subtly modulates his tone, from jocular to gravely ironic, as the plot's darker, more suspenseful elements take over. The result is as good an example as any of the humorous mystery novel at its unpretentious best: playful but far from giddy, perfectly poised between drollery (part satire, part human comedy) and the stern realities of crime and punishment.
 
THE FAMILY THE TOWN LOVED TO HATE
 Coming along Wynton Lane [Rosamund] saw a little squad of people: a heavy, dirty man who looked as if he had slept in his clothes for the past week; a slatternly woman pushing a push-chair and shoving forward the toddler who belonged in it, but who was instead walking beside her; a teenage girl, deplorably dressed, making a precocious attempt at sexiness; and lastly a smaller girl, maybe just of school age, but still uncertain on her feet. . . . What a gang!
Suddenly it came to her. The Phelans! This must be the Phelans. With feelings of dread mixed with excitement she watched their progress down the road.

HEADLINE: ABOUT CARS;
A 50th Birthday For Edsel Ford's Continental

BYLINE: By MARSHALL SCHUON

 BODY:
''The Continental, introduced in 1939, was one of the most graceful automotive designs ever executed, a fitting aesthetic sign-off for the age of the American classic car.''
Stephen W. Sears in ''The American Heritage History of the Automobile in America.''
This seems to be my week for Lincoln Continentals. First of all, I have been driving a new one. Then, just by chance, I discovered the hulk of a classic 1956 Continental Mark II on the lot of a New Jersey restoration shop and spent some time running eyes and hands over its lovely lines. That same day, I also spotted a beautiful metal model of the 1956 in an antiques shop and dug into my pocket for more than I could afford. 
The only part of this that was planned, in fact, was the test drive of the silver Continental, which seemed a good idea on a couple of counts.
This year is the car's 50th birthday. And the test seemed to have further merit because, like some other cars today, the Continental's dash provides information on instant and average fuel economy, not a bad thing given the price of gas and the probability that Washington's budget proposals will add further tax to every gallon.
The first Continental was conceived by Henry Ford's son, Edsel, as a special car to use on his vacation in Palm Beach, Fla. Returning from a trip to Europe, he gave sketches of foreign luxury cars to Ford stylists and asked them to give his car a ''continental look'' that would include a spare tire mounted on the trunk.
The vacation vehicle was delivered in February of 1939, and everyone who saw it thought it was sensational - so much so that the company decided to put it into production. The 1940 model, introduced in October of 1939, was built on a Lincoln Zephyr platform, had a 120-horsepower V-12 engine and cost $2,850.
The car has long been a collector's item, and prices now range upward of $30,000. The nameplate disappeared in 1949, but that second Continental, the Mark II, produced another instant classic when it was introduced in 1956, and that car, made only in 1956 and 1957, was priced at $10,000, lofty indeed when you consider that a standard Lincoln hardtop could be had for $4,600.
For 1991, the front-wheel-drive Continental is a four-door sedan in the middle of the Lincoln line, and it comes in two versions, the Executive series at $30,211 and the Signature series at $32,120.
Standard on both are such things as antilock brakes, computer-controlled air suspension, heated sideview mirrors and cruise control. But the Signature models add molded aluminum wheels, combination door locks and a power trunk, among other things.
Upholstery is in leather, with buckets up front and a bench in the rear. There is good room, but lack of storage is a surprising problem. The glovebox is a medium-size bin, containing a single cupholder in its lid, and there are pleated pockets on the doors, but that's it. No place for tapes, none for compact disks. Nowhere for a driver's coffee cup, and no handy place for toll change.
The driver does get an air bag in the hub of the four-spoke steering wheel, and the dash is built to accommodate a passenger air bag as well. However, Ford has had problems getting the larger right-side air bags (the supplier's plant blew up), and a company spokesman said they won't be available until December.
Behind the leather-wrapped wheel, you look at a digital dash whose speedometer paints itself in inch-high green. Buttons on the right side of the panel control the ''Message Display Center'' and show trip mileage, instant economy, average economy and how far you can go on the fuel in the tank. And that gets us back to what turned out to be an exercise in economical driving.
The Continental's 3.8-liter V6 is rated at 18 miles per gallon, city, and 26, highway, and three days' of mindless commuting provided a baseline average of 21.4 m.p.g. - not bad for a car that weighs 3,663 pounds but an average I thought could be improved upon.
With the message display set on instant economy and the constantly changing digits kept above the baseline, the highway figure rose to an amazing 31.6. And despite New York's impossible traffic and ever-present construction, careful driving produced an overall average of 22.8.
That was more than a mile per gallon better, and the process made the commute a lot more interesting. I did wonder, though, what Edsel Ford would think about today's luxury and the notion of fun with feather-footing.

New York's Business Conditions Get a 'Poor' Rating

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
In the eyes of executives around the country, New York City has grown markedly worse this year as a place to locate offices, according to a new survey.
Nearly one-third of all chief executive officers who claim familiarity with New York believe general business conditions in the city are poor, as reported in the annual ''Business America Real Estate Monitor,'' which Louis Harris & Associates conducts for the Cushman & Wakefield real estate concern. This is a sharp rise from last year, when 19 percent gave New York poor marks.
Specifically, the executives passed a harsh judgment on ''the climate state and local government creates for business through tax policy and the extent of regulation.'' This year, 41 percent think that New York's climate is poor, virtually double the percentage of previous years. 
Another noticeable increase has been registered in the number of executives who give New York poor marks for the cost and availability of labor. That rose to 36 percent this year, from 27 percent in 1988.
Cushman & Wakefield's chief operating officer, Anthony F. Sirianni, had a one-word explanation for the shift: ''Economics.''
If there is any comfort in the survey for local officials, developers and landlords, it may be that in more tangible categories - as opposed to the perceptual ones - New York would seem to be holding its ground.
For example, while Seattle gets the highest marks of any city in the country for its general business conditions, the New York area is nonetheless cited by more executives whose companies are ''actually planning to acquire office space in the next 12 months.''
''Major metropolitan areas are the places where business leaders intend to expand their operations,'' Mr. Sirianni said. ''They already have major investments here and, while they would like things to be better than they are, these are the places where they intend to make additional investments.''
''I think the negative things are a warning, rather than a statement that things are beyond repair,'' he said. ''It's a tenant's market in New York. Rents haven't increased as much as they would have five years ago. But the survey offers a warning that there are other factors that may overcome the benefits New York offers. You see the warning signs in the ways they've answered the questions of labor and quality of life.''
''Quality of life'' encompasses such things as the availability of housing, transportation and recreation. More than a quarter of the executives believe that New York offers a poor quality of life to their employees, while only 4 percent consider it excellent. Both excellent and poor ratings are the lowest in three years. The plurality of respondents, 47 percent, believe that New York's quality of life is ''only fair.''
Notwithstanding these sentiments, 7 percent of executives whose companies plan to lease, purchase, build or renovate new office space in the coming year say they will do so in the New York metropolitan area, versus 3 percent in the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue area. Indeed, when it comes to actual acquisition plans, the only locales ahead of New York are Los Angeles and Chicago.
Of those executives who plan to acquire new manufacturing, warehouse and distribution space in the next year, 8 percent plan to do so in the New York area, twice the number for greater Seattle. New York ranks No. 1 nationwide in this category - ''a very strong finish,'' Mr. Sirianni commented.
Moreover, one-third of all executives still give New York City excellent marks for ''easy access to markets, customers, clients,'' with only 10 percent saying it is poor in that regard. That is the category that they consider of paramount importance when thinking about office locations.
And although one-quarter of the executives rate as poor ''the cost, functionality and expandability'' of available office space in New York, that number has not worsened since 1989 and, indeed, has improved noticeably since 1988, when 37 percent of the respondents felt that way.
Yet there is a dark cloud even over the more upbeat statistics. The percentage of executives planning to acquire office space in the New York area is half what it was in 1989.
New York was not alone in the suddenness with which its ratings changed. For example, the number of executives who gave Boston a poor rating quadrupled to 20 percent this year, from 5 percent in 1989.
''We were surprised by the extreme volatility from one year to the next,'' said Warren Wechsler, first senior vice president of the Real Estate Board of New York. ''Even though there is a regional recession, that would not be reflected in so drastic a shift in the ratings of the cities as business operating sites. Many of the ratings given these cities have changed to a much greater degree than economic and fiscal circumstances.''
''I still think there are a lot of high-tech firms that want to be on Route 128 because of the proximity to Harvard and M.I.T.,'' he said, ''and many major merchant banks, both foreign and domestic, that want to be in New York because this is one of the three or four pulse points for the global economony.''
In other words, Mr. Wechsler asked: ''Which of the following does not belong? Paris. London. New York. Seattle.''
As to the dramatic increase in the number of executives who were critical of New York's governmental climate, Mr. Sirianni declined to speculate on whether that was connected to the administration of Mayor David N. Dinkins. He pointed out that the very low number of executives who said the climate was excellent had basically remained unchanged since the last years of Edward I. Koch's mayoralty.
''The question isn't really about politics,'' Mr. Sirianni said. ''The question is really about - I hesitate to use the word bureaucracy or red tape - but the elements of a city government that are there to assist these decision makers in getting what they're looking for to expand their businesses.''
Interviews for the survey were conducted from July 2 to Aug. 20. The subjects were 400 chief executive officers or their designated representatives (typically chief financial officers or chief operating officers) in companies with revenues of $250 million or more.
Companies in the East accounted for 35 percent of the sample, with 27 percent from the Midwest, 23 percent from the South and 16 percent from the West. Manufacturers represented 32 percent of the sample, with 19 percent being wholesalers and retailers and 24 percent involved in finance, insurance or real estate.
Opinions on New York were reported only for those respondents - 50 percent of the sample - who said they were familiar with the city as a business location. It is not known whether those who were most critical of New York were executives who actually work or do business in the city.
And that was one of the concerns raised by Mr. Wechsler, of the Real Estate Board. ''There's no indication as to who these C.E.O.'s are,'' he said. ''So it's hard to say how that would affect their preferences. We don't know what we are being told because we don't know who's telling us.''
Cities besides Seattle whose general business conditions were rated as excellent by one-fifth or more of the executives were Sacramento, Calif., 29 percent; Portland, Ore., 24 percent; Norfolk, Va., 22 percent; San Diego, 21 percent; Atlanta, 20 percent and Columbus, Ohio, 20 percent.
Other cities whose general business conditions got a poor grade from one-fifth or more of the executives were Detroit, 30 percent; Miami, 23 percent; New Orleans, 21 percent; Boston, 20 percent; Los Angeles, 20 percent and Washington, 20 percent.

HEADLINE: Homes and Offices for Sterling Forest?

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY

 BODY:
The long-delayed effort to develop Sterling Forest - 18,000 acres of woods, wetlands, streams and lakes that sprawl across southern Orange County 50 miles northwest of Manhattan - is gaining momentum as the owner moves to make the most of that region's economic boom.
Later this month, the owner, the Sterling Forest Corporation, the real estate subsidiary of the Home Insurance Company, will learn from consultants and planners how four basic development concepts it has drawn up for the property would affect wildlife, water supply, traffic congestion, solid-waste management, regional employment and local communities.
The company will then seek approvals for a preferred plan, which could be one of four devised so far or, more likely, a composite of elements from two or more of the design proposals. Once the plan is approved, construction could start on a new community with as many as 14,500 homes, schools and recreational areas, up to 7.5 million square feet of office and industrial space, hotels, stores and perhaps even a bus or trolley line.
The forest, the largest piece of privately held undeveloped property in the metropolitan area, embraces more than 27 square miles in the Hudson Valley - a territory larger than Manhattan. 
But the owners are moving forward at a time when New York State may try to buy part of the forest for preservation. On the ballot in next month's election is a $2 billion evironmental bond issue, the largest in the state's history, with $800 million set aside for land acquisition. Sterling Forest is among the properties the state is thinking about buying as part of its inventory of environmentally sensitive land.
New Jersey has already condemned 2,300 acres of Sterling Forest that extend into Passaic County, but the price is still in dispute.
Any development plans for Sterling Forest would have to be approved by the Towns of Tuxedo, Warwick and Monroe because parts of the forest are in each of those towns. The company is still months away from carrying final blueprints to local officials, but the plans drawn up so far offer a broad outline of what may rise on the land over the next 25 years.
''The forest is an asset that the company now wants to utilize,'' said Robert Thompson, chairman of Sterling Forest Corporation. ''But in the case of this property, preservation and development are not mutually exclusive goals.''
Mr. Thompson, a lawyer and former chief deputy attorney for Los Angeles, was brought in from California to steer plans through the development process.
Home Insurance, a property and casualty company, is owned by Ambase, the troubled publicly held Manhattan financial services company. Earlier this month it agreed to sell the insurance subsidiary to an investment group that includes Trygg-Hansa, a Swedish insurance company, and Vik Brothers USA, a European investor group.
A spokesman for Sterling Forest Corporation, which has owned the property for nearly 40 years, said that the transaction would have no effect on development plans.
Any development will face a host of obstacles - starting with the land's topography. As much as 70 percent of the forest is either marshland or steeply sloped hills. The bulk of the forest has no power, telephone, water or sewage lines or sewage-treatment plants that any large-scale development plan would require. And environmentalists in New York and New Jersey have expressed concern over the impact of any development on local water supplies in both states.
Both conservationists and community officials give the Sterling Forest Corporation high marks for its accessibility, its spirit of flexibility and for its having taken account of the communities' views in the development process at each step so far. But none of the four design concepts released by the Sterling Forest Corporation in a series of public meetings in the region last June has the wholehearted support of local officials, conservationists or regional planners.
''The sentiment here leans toward supporting further development of the forest,'' said the Supervisor of the Town of Tuxedo, Annette Dorozynski. ''But from our point of view, all of the plans call for too much housing.''
Ms. Dorozynski said she doubted that residents of the homes in any of plans suggested so far would pay taxes high enough to cover the cost of required municipal services. Whatever the company's final proposal, which is expected to be ready early next year, it has pledged to keep at least 75 percent of the forest open for the estimated 200,000 visitors who hunt, hike, fish and ski there each year.
This is not the first time the owners have sought to exploit both the forest's natural beauty and its proximity to New York City and northern New Jersey. In the mid-70's the corporation put forth a development plan that was turned down by local residents, who argued that further development would spoil the region's rural character. Another attempt at development was postponed indefinitely because of the oil crisis of the late 70's.
Three years ago the Sterling Forest Corporation looked for buyers for the land but later took it off the market before a firm deal could be made.
What has stirred the corporation's recent development ambitions is that while the rest of the metropolitan region struggles with a souring economy, Orange County is an anomaly; it is undergoing an economic expansion and development boom that has made it the fastest growing county in the state.
According to the Orange County Partnership, the county has had a net gain of 35,000 jobs since 1983 and 50 national and international companies have set up operations there since 1986. Among them are General Electric, Anheuser-Busch and Minolta, which last year opened its 90,000-square-foot North American headquarters in Goshen.
The Regional Plan Association has estimated that if Orange County continues growing at its current pace it will need 50,000 more housing units in the next 20 years. And housing is the centerpiece of two of the four development alternatives being considered by the Sterling Forest Corporation.
One plan, which would create a new community, calls for a mix of 14,500 units ranging from one-family houses to multi-family dwellings on sites up to an acre. It places most of the development east of Sterling Lake in the eastern portion of the property, near Route 17A and a yet-to-be-built north-south road.
The commercial component would total about 7.5 million square feet, including 750,000 square feet of retail space. There would also be up to five golf courses, at least one of which would be open to the public, and some sort of a community transit system.
A second plan, which would create the highest density of the four, would bring 13,602 housing units plus about 7.4 million square feet of commercial space, including office and research and design space, as well as a hotel and conference center.
This plan would be confined to the smallest area of the four and would leave the most open space. Most of the housing and commercial space would rise in a corridor between Route 17A and County Road 72, with little building in the western portion of the forest. Most conservationists favor this plan because it preserves the most forest land - 14,000 acres.
A third proposal assumes that no master plan is adopted for development in the forest and that as many as 170 parcels are sold off for development under existing zoning rules. It illustrates what might occur if the property were carved up and sold off tomorrow, but does not take into account changes in current zoning laws that the communities are considering.
Using this model, development would be scattered throughout the forest, rather than clustered in the eastern portion, and would result in 11,959 units of housing - mostly single-family homes - and just over a million square feet of commercial space.
A fourth proposal, which has been structured around the conventional suburban open-space development concept, calls for the greatest number of detached one-family homes - 9,000 - and the fewest multi-family housing units - 1,531. With this plan, commercial space would be kept at about 3.8 million square feet. Conservationists do not see any plan as ideal. ''The consultants have done spectacular design jobs,'' said John Humbach, spokesman for the Coalition for the Preservation of Sterling Forest, an umbrella group for eight environmental and conservation organizations, including local chapters of the Audubon Society and the Sierra Club, ''It is a shame that the forest is where they want to put it.''
''We feel it is the wrong site for any kind of development, no matter how well done,'' Mr. Humbach continued. ''Any development plan would turn the forest into a wooded suburb, and there are hundreds of wooded suburbs but only one Sterling Forest. It is one of the last vestiges of the great Northeastern Forest.''
The Regional Plan Association also has reservations about the four concepts, although its officials say they will not take a formal position until a master plan has been proposed. But in a letter to Mr. Thompson, chairman of the corporation, Richard T. Anderson, president of the Regional Plan Association, suggested that while the design plan that would preserve the most forest had ''some promising aspects,'' even that one would need extensive changes to provide less development and more open space.
Much of Sterling Forest is far from virgin territory. Portions of it were first exploited in the 1730's by Cornelius Board, a Scottish immigrant prospecting for mineral deposits. He discovered the iron ore that was to turn the land that is now Sterling Forest into one of the most active mining, refining and logging regions in the Northeast.
Under the ownership of James Alexander, the Earl of Sterling - for whom the property was named - a furnace was built and mines were added.
Mining was done extensively until the first part of the 20th century. In 1895, E. M. Harriman - father of the late Gov. W. Averell Harriman - bought the property. It remained in the family until the early 1950's, when it was acquired by the City Investing Company of New York, a forerunnner to Ambase.
Over the last three decades six residential developments with 300 one-family homes were built in Sterling Forest, as were office buildings for I.B.M., International Paper, Xicom and other companies. New York University established a medical research center there and for the last 15 years Tiger Mountain has held the four trails for the Sterling Forest Ski Center.
Sterling Gardens is now a 160-acre fairground where a Rennaissance festival is held each September. Moreover, some 400 new residences are to be built in the forest on land still owned by the corporation and on parcels bought by developers.
While preservationists hope that the bond issue passes, the state's acquisition of the land would not automatically preclude development. ''The state has never taken the position that there should be no further development in the forest,'' said Langdon Marsh, executive deputy commissioner of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. ''Nor is it likely that we would buy the entire parcel. Our objective is to find the right mix of preservation and development.''
Mr. Marsh said that it appears that goal could be accomplished if a substantial portion of the forest - particularly on the high ground - were left open while limited development was allowed along the corridors that already have residences and commercial buildings. He said that the state has met with the owners several times in the last few years and that it is having the whole forest appraised.
Mr. Humbach of the Coalition for the Preservation of Sterling Forest and others would like to see New York follow the lead of New Jersey and buy up the land. While the Sterling Forest Corporation has not contested the condemnation by New Jersey, it has gone to court seeking more than the $2 million the state has offered.
Mr. Humbach said his members were aware that it is the responsibility of the Sterling Forest Corporation to maximize the value of the forest.
''We recognize that the corporation is obligated to make the best deal for the stockholders,'' he said. ''That is why it is important that the state negotiate a fair price because development, we believe, is not the answer.''
The Sterling Forest Corporation would not be averse to having New York State acquire the forest, but company officials say they do not think the state will have the money to buy more than half the 18,000 acres, even if the bond act passes.
''I think that some sort of development will take place here in the next 10 years,'' said Mr. Thompson, the Sterling Forest chairman. ''It must be done with care and respect.'' The Tuxedo Supervisor, Ms. Dorozynski, agreed.
''The town's population is aging,'' she said, ''and our elementary school enrollment has declined. In order to have the kinds of services that we need and want in the future we will need some economic growth.''
''Another matter that some people don't want to face,'' she continued, ''is that even if the forest remains as it is, we will continue to pick up part of the tariff. As public parkland, even more people will be visiting the area and the pressure on our services will be greater than it is now.''

HEADLINE: Arts Face Lean Times as Patrons Retrench

BYLINE: By CHARLOTTE LIBOV

 BODY:
BATTERED by cutbacks in corporate contributions and audience belt-tightening, arts groups are facing hard times.
In Litchfield County, Pilobolus, the contemporary dance troupe, has shortened its season.
In Hartford, the Connecticut Opera, faced with a $100,000 deficit, is playing it safe by offering less risky productions of popular works.
In New Haven, First Night, last year's successful collection of New Year's Eve performances, will not be repeated this year.
These changes come as banks, real-estate firms and other businesses, faced with their own money problems, are curtailing their contributions to theaters, galleries, museums and other arts organizations. 
''This is the most difficult period I've ever seen in 20 years,'' said Robert Gregson, acting director of New Haven's one-person bureau of cultural affairs, which was slashed from a six-person department because of the city's fiscal problems. ''In the past, there's always been a program on the horizon that you could envision, but that's not true now.''
Wilson H. Faude, executive director of the Old State House, a museum in Hartford, said arts organizations must learn to accept the new realities.
''Years ago, groups depended on individuals and foundations,'' he said. ''Then, everyone got on the corporate bandwagon. Now, the cookie jar has been locked in the closet, and the stockholders must be fed first.'' Mr. Faude said.
 
Chilling Forecasts
So the Mattatuck Museum is discovering. The museum, in Waterbury, is in the midst of asking its corporate and business members to renew their memberships. ''We're hearing stories about companies that are bankrupt or have laid off one-third of their workforce,'' said the executive director, Ann Smith. ''And when you're in that situation, they can't write out a $150 check.''
The situation is likely to get worse, not better, warned Thomas Griggs, an assistant vice president at People's Bank, in New Haven, who serves on the boards of several arts organizations, including Connecticut Grand Opera, in Bridgeport.
''When businesses were budgeting last year, they budgeted for 1990 with some degree of generosity,'' he said. ''But the economy has become poorer. So the scary part is that funding for next year is being cut drastically. Arts organizations haven't seen the worst of it.''
In addition to curtailing contributions, businesses, facing staff layoffs, can no longer encourage their remaining workers to volunteer their time, Mr. Griggs said. ''The business people just don't have the freedom and flexibility we had in the past to serve on the boards of nonprofits.''
The state's ''real-estate and banking problems have affected a lot of people,'' said George D. Osborn, general director of the Connecticut Opera, based in Hartford, which is trying to cope with a $100,000 deficit. ''We have a number of people who have seen their investments go down substantially, and, clearly, if someone is losing money on their investments, they're much more careful about making donations.''
To increase ticket sales, the opera company is chosing to perform sure-fire popular works, like ''Carmen'' and the upcoming ''Marriage of Figaro,'' he said.
Such a strategy is also being used by the Stamford Center of the Arts, which has laid off 3 of its 14 staff members.
 
Aiming at 'Commercial Success'
''If financial pressures increase, every aspect of the operation is affected, including the choice of programs,'' said the executive director of the Stamford center, Randall Brion. ''You do those things which have a very high probability of commercial success.
''In the past, we had presented a program of contemporary composers performing their own works. It wasn't big box office, but we had an artistic responsiblity. But that's a program we haven't repeated this year.''
Cutbacks in corporate grants are also hurting the Long Wharf Theater, said David Mayher, a spokesman for the regional theater in New Haven. Rehearsal hours have been cut, he said, plays with fewer cast members are being performed, and more collaborations are being arranged with other theater companies, to save money.
But those in the field say that while the large institutions plan cutbacks, the smaller arts groups face the prospect of going under.
''I don't believe that the community would permit the Shubert,'' in New Haven, or the city's symphony orchestra ''to go away,'' said Michael Bingham, editor and publisher of The New Haven Advocate, a weekly newpaper. ''But I think everything else is in danger.''
One casualty already is First Night New Haven, a collection of theatrical performances, concerts and parades, which had been scheduled for New Year's Eve. Canceling the celebration was difficult, but there was basically no choice, said Mr. Bingham, who heads the First Night governing board. He said he hopes the event can be held next year.
''A lot of the businsses that had committed money to First Night this year said, 'We don't want to back out, but we prefer that you give us a break this year, because we're feeling a lot of financial pain,' '' he said.
Robert Resnikoff, a spokesman for the Greater Hartford Arts Council, said he is worried, too.
''We're trying to give a dose of reality therapy to all of the arts groups, so that we can consolidate and strengthen organizations and come out the other end of the economic downturn stronger and more viable than before,'' Mr. Resnikoff said.
In Litchfield County, the contemporary dance group Pilobolus, based in Washington, is not in danger of closing but has shortened its season, to 27 weeks from 35 to 40 weeks, said the manager, Susan Mandler. Pilobolus often performs at universities, whose budgets are being cut, too, she said.
 
'Hit Coming and Going'
Real Art Ways, a contemporary art gallery in Hartford, moved to a less-expensive location on the outskirts of the city last year, when real-estate prices were high. Now, the cost of real estate has fallen, but so has the organization's income, said the executive director, Will K. Wilkins.
''We managed to be the victim of the boom right when it busted,'' he said. ''We got hit coming and going.''
New Haven has always been a cultural center, but organizations there are particularly feeling the pinch, said the executive director of the local arts council, Frances Clark.
''We have a very small corporate base,'' she said. ''Now, it's getting worse and worse. There is practically no money.''
Performance Studio, a theatrical organization, mounted productions in a vacant restaurant in downtown New Haven, until the owner found he could no longer afford to keep the place vacant and is now trying to find a paying tenant, said the group's artistic director, Amy Seham. This was the latest blow for the theater, which two years ago was forced to end its popular outdoor Shakespeare plays because of declining corporate sponsorship.
 
Bookings Cut Back
Another New Haven group, Orchestra New England, is emerging from bankruptcy into the current tight economy. The group has lost the corporate sponsor for its annual Thanksgiving concert and has found its bookings by public schools and community groups cut back, said the general manager, Russ Rosensweig. She said the orchestra is pinning its hopes on a soon-to-be released compact disk, ''The Orchestral Music of Charles Ives.''
''This is being released internationally, so we're going to look for money outside of New England, where the recession is going to hit,'' Ms. Rosensweig said. No matter how the economy fares, it should not serve as an excuse for business to abandon the arts, said Mr. Griggs, the banker in New Haven.
''It is the responsibility of the corporate businesses to help these organizations through the tough times, because they are what makes Connecticut a nice place to be,'' he said. ''If they go out of business when times are tough, when things get better, we won't have them. You can't just re-create something like Long Wharf Theater.''

HEADLINE: National Attention On Spirited Contest

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO

 BODY:
NOT every Congressional race can feature a visit from Robert Redford and a stopover by President Bush. But such political ammunition is being hauled out in the Fifth District battle between a popular three-term Waterbury Alderman, Gary A. Franks, the Republican candidate, and a former Congressman and television newscaster, Toby Moffett, the Democratic nominee.
Mr. Bush's visit, scrubbed last week because of the budget debate in Washington, has been rescheduled for Oct. 23. His appearance underscores the contest's status as one of the most watched among the two dozen House races in the nation. 
Should he win the seat, which is currently held by the Republican gubernatorial candidate, John G. Rowland, of Waterbury, Mr. Franks would become the first black Republican since 1935 to sit as a voting member in the House. If Mr. Moffett wins, it would mark a major political comeback for a 1970's wunderkind who lost bids for the United States Senate in 1982 and for governor in 1986.
The race has also been unusually spirited, with Mr. Franks loudly calling Mr. Moffett a carpetbagger for recently moving to the district and Mr. Moffett repeatedly challenging his opponent to release his Federal and state income-tax returns.
 
'Nice, Clear Contrast'
''It's been rough and tumble,'' said Mr. Franks's press secretary, Stephen R. Beaujon.
The well-funded campaign, like that in the Third District between State Senator Thomas Scott, a Republican from Milford, and Rosa DiLauro, a Democrat from New Haven, presents an unusually stark contrast between the candidates' political philosophies. The Third District seat is now held by the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, Bruce A. Morrison, of Hamden. ''It is a very nice, clear contrast for people,'' Mr. Moffett said. Mr. Franks is a conservative, favors expanding the use of the death penalty, opposes the Federal family-leave legislation, says he believes the Federal budget should be cut principally through spending reductions and opposes the proposed Civil Rights Act of 1990, saying it resembles a quota system.
''Franks takes the Jesse Helms position, and he is out of synch with the entire district,'' Mr. Moffett said. ''He could be representing Grosse Pointe, Mich., more easily than Waterbury.''
Mr. Moffett is a liberal who favors the civil-rights and family-leave bills, opposes the death penalty and generally believes government intervention is a positive and productive force.
''He is a tax-and-spend liberal, a career politician from the past, a Jimmy Carter retread,'' Mr. Franks said.
Mr. Franks, 37 years old, also supports a cut in the capital-gains tax to help stimulate the economy. Mr. Moffett, 46, has said that he is ''not fundamentally opposed'' to such a plan, if it is carefully structured and includes raising other taxes for wealthy Americans.
''Moffett is trying to grab some conservative garb and wrap himself in it,'' Mr. Beaujon said.
Until last fall, Mr. Moffett worked for a New Britain television station. In recent months, he has been a self-employed environmental consultant.
 
'Against the Reagan Era'
He won his party's nomination in a fiercely contested battle with the Mayor of Shelton, Michael Pacowta, who decided against running in a primary after achieving more than 20 percent of the delegates at the Democratic Party's Fifth District convention in July.
''I'm running against the Reagan era, and I make no bones about that,'' Mr. Moffett said.
Mr. Franks has repeatedly criticized Mr. Moffett for his recent move to Newtown, in the Fifth District, which meanders across the western half of the state from Meriden to Danbury and includes such wealthy towns as Weston and Wilton, as well as Waterbury and the old blue-collar mill towns along the Naugatuck River.
Previously, Mr. Moffett had lived for three years in Branford, in the Third District. In his years in the House, representing the Sixth District from 1974 to 1982, he lived in Litchfield. There is no residency requirement for Congressional candidates. ''He is an opportunist,'' Mr. Franks said. ''He took a one-year lease in January, and he is trying to use the district to go to Washington.''
Mr. Moffett countered that he has spent far more time over the course of his political career working in the district. ''The issue here is who is the fighter here, and who does not have a record,'' he said. ''The real issue is who is the stranger and who is not.'' Mr. Moffett characterized the race as a contest between someone ''who remembers where they came from'' and someone ''who forgets.''
Mr. Franks ''shows no interest, no sense of outrage in urban problems,'' Mr. Moffett said. ''He has never fought and bled for people and cities who need a break.''
He said Mr. Franks comes from the ''I got mine, you get yours'' school of politics. ''If you are perceived as selling your soul, you lose respect from everyone,'' Mr. Moffett added.
 
Five-Candidate Field
Mr. Franks, who grew up in Waterbury and was graduated from Yale University, won his party's nomination in July at a seven-hour, nine-ballot, five-candidate convention. The other Republicans who vied for the spot were Steve Watson, of Danbury, State Senator James H. McLaughlin, of Brookfield, State Representative Alan Schlesinger, of Derby, and former State Representative Warren Sarasin, of Beacon Falls.
Mr. Franks, who owns his own real-estate company, defended his decision not to release his tax forms by saying that he had met all the Federal Election Commission requirements. ''I'm not going to be singled out and do something that other Congressional candidates have not done,'' he said.
In response, Mr. Moffett asked: ''Did he pay his fare share? We don't know. It's an issue that won't go away.''
Mr. Franks also dismissed charges that he is a slumlord because several of his properties occupied by low-income residents have been cited for minor building-code violations.
''It is very easy to get a violation, for a missing smoke detector battery or whatever,'' he said. ''This is a way to attack individuals when candidates don't have anything else to talk about.''
 
Visit From Ex-Speaker
Mr. Franks, meanwhile, has continued to hammer away at Mr. Moffett's liberalism. He noted that Mr. Moffett intends to bring former House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., of Massachusetts, into the district for campaign appearances. ''He is bringing in Mr. Tax-and-Spend himself,'' Mr. Franks said.
Mr. Redford, who owns a home in Weston, touted Mr. Moffett's environmental record during a stop in Danbury two weeks ago.
Mr. Franks has defused private murmurings by top Republicans in the district that they were unhappy with his campaign. ''With the President coming into Waterbury, that is the ultimate sign of support from the Republican Party,'' he said.
Besides the Presidential visit, Mr. Franks is expecting campaign appearances by Barbara Bush, and Marilyn Quayle, the wife of Vice President Dan Quayle. Mr. Franks said he expects to be aided by Mr. Rowland's political coattails in the district.
''I believe it will play a major role in the race,'' he said. ''John will cause the voters to come out in Presidential-year numbers in the Fifth District, and in Waterbury, a large number of Republicans will turn out.''

HEADLINE: Closter Journal;
A Harvest That Helps the Needy

BYLINE: By ALBERT J. PARISI

DATELINE: CLOSTER

 BODY:
THE autumn sun beat down on Mary Crain, but that didn't seem to matter because there was the smell of harvest in the air. At her feet, a bushel of just-picked green and red peppers gave off a fragrance not found in supermarkets.
''Try finding these in the produce aisle,'' she said, straightening up and wiping her brow with the back of her hand. ''You don't mind this part of the job so much when you think about where it's going to. What we grow here fills a few empty stomachs, and that's what a farm was meant to do.''
For Mrs. Crain and a core of volunteers who manage the historic Abram Demaree Homestead on the corner of Old Hook and Schraalenburgh Roads here, preserving an 18th-century Dutch Huguenot-style farmhouse and recalling Bergen County's agricultural history are not enough. For the last two years, they have helped farm the land adjacent to the site, and its rewards have been reaped by the needy of two states. 
 
Believing in Something
''I guess some people might think that we're a little odd to do all this,'' said Mrs. Crain, a Haworth resident and the nonprofit group's president. ''But is it too much trouble to believe in something and go out and do something about it? I think not.''
The vegetables, grown on about seven acres of land planted by a local farmer, are aiding regional nutrition programs, like the Salvation Army Meal Project in Hackensack, as well as soup kitchens in New York City. The produce is given free to established charitable organizations, Mrs. Crain said.
The harvesting became a reality, she said, because the homestead wanted to convey ''a sense of what a working farm is all about.''
The roads' intersection, she said, is one of the busiest in the county - a recent county traffic study indicates that about 18,000 cars travel by daily - ''and we wanted people who go by to see that this is how it was long ago, when lives and the economy were not ruled by computer chips and the stock market.''
Rick Henning, a spokesman for the Rivervale Realty Company, which leases the acreage to the homestead group for $1 annually, said, ''What they've accomplished here is incredible and should serve as a lesson to all of us.'' Through the group's need to heighten a sense of historic awareness, the homeless are being reached out of a common effort, he said.
For Lieut. Jorge Diaz, director of the Salvation Army Community Center in Hackensack, the effort comes at a time when more and more homeless people are taxing his limited resources.
''We really don't have enough funds to go around, and these vegetables help to augment our meals,'' he said. ''This is hearty food, and for many, this becomes the bowl of soup served up with a roll that holds them over from day to day.'' His organization feeds about 50 people a day, he said.
John R. Mooney, a spokesman for City Harvest, a New York City nonprofit organization that ships about 10,000 pounds of food every day to more than 100 shelters and assistance programs in the city, said: ''That food is literally helping thousands to get by, and it couldn't have come at a better time. Their foodstuff is good, it's fresh and it's badly needed.''
Mrs. Crain said that volunteers had helped in the harvest but that the amount and variety of the crops - including five types of peppers, three kinds of tomatoes, eggplant, squash, green beans, turnips, lettuce and collard greens, guarded by a scarecrow - were more plentiful than expected.
''We've been able to manage some of the picking, but we kind of fell short,'' she said. But a solution was realized.
''A church group from New York was supposed to come down and pick up a load of vegetables, but they wound up arriving a day early,'' Mrs. Crain said. ''Some of it was picked, a lot of it wasn't and when I told them that, they just said, 'Well, point us to where it's at and we'll do the picking.' ''
Members of the Open Door Church of God and Christ, in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, worked for hours filling bushel baskets and have returned often. For many church members, picking crops destined to help others has brought back memories.
''This is nothing for me because I grew up on a farm,'' said Henry Cook, a North Carolina native, as he loaded a bushel of ripe tomatoes onto an aging church minibus. ''As a kid, our days were long out in the field and this ain't nothing,'' he said.
He added that the crop picked would go toward preparing meals for a regularly scheduled Saturday dinner for the needy as well as a twice weekly food giveaway that helps about 500 families in Bedford-Stuyvesant.
''You know, people think about the homeless and all they see are those by themselves in the street, but that ain't so,'' Mr. Cook said. ''It's not what we see. We're seeing people with kids that don't have enough to make ends meet and that's where this food goes, and thank God for it.''
 
'Eating Instead of Needing'
For Melvin Lee Ward, a church volunteer also raised on a farm, the harvest means feeding those less fortunate than himself.
''I put food on the table for others by using my hands,'' he said, holding up two bell peppers the size of softballs. ''Tomorrow or the next, somebody's going to be eating instead of needing.''
Laurence E. Smith, a church member and spot welder by profession, said that ''sometime a while back somebody helped me when I needed it'' and that the harvest was just one means of ''giving back the courtesy.''
''Whether it's us doing the picking or these people here who thought enough to grow this fine food and give it away, we're all choosing to help to give a helping hand to folks that can't help themselves,'' he said. Other volunteers echoed the feelings. ''I heard about what they were doing here and felt that I should do my part,'' said Cindy Kaplan of Haworth, an independent film producer. ''We all need to reach out and make that difference.'' For Mrs. Crain, the planting and harvest are a chance for herself and the homestead organization to help a community that extends beyond the bounds of the farmland and the municipality. ''The homestead exists because of people's concern and generosity,'' she said, explaining that its budget is based on private donations and funds generated by an annual arts and craft sale, from Nov. 8 through Dec. 16.
Though the ground is fertile, some crops do better than others.
 
Bad Luck With Pumpkins
''The last couple of years, we've had bad luck with pumpkins,'' Mrs. Crain said. ''We were able this season to grow a couple of good-sized ones, but somebody came through here the other night and stole them.''
Last year's pumpkins were lost to groundhogs after volunteers had promised to donate them to gravely ill children at local hospitals. The crop perished, but the promise did not. Mrs. Crain purchased pumpkins, and volunteers helped to deliver them.
Next year, the group plans to cultivate additional acreage. ''We're trying to get a corporation interested in underwriting a small tractor for us,'' Mrs. Crain said.
The donations are appreciated in ways that may never be seen, Mr. Cook said. ''Some people don't know what it is to be hungry,'' he said, ''but we see some families where the kids go without because the welfare check goes to drugs instead of what's right. To see a small child smile because he's eating regular, that makes all difference. Kids ain't done nothing to nobody. There's no need for them to suffer.''

Seattle Induces Office Builders to Include Child Care

BYLINE: By HARRIET KING

DATELINE: SEATTLE

 BODY:
 In four other cities that give developers density bonuses for child care -- Irvine, Calif., Portland, Ore., Cincinnati and Hart ford -- proposed projects have been put on hold until sluggish real estate markets im prove.
In the other areas where child-care centers or fees for a community day-care fund are mandatory -- Clayton, Concord, Danville, Martinez, San Francisco and San Ramon, all in California, plus Boston -- only a handful, mostly in California, have been built in new properties. Most developers have chosen to put money in a community child-care fund rather than meet strict codes or negotiate with day-care operators.
In 1985, a change in the zoning code here gave builders 12 square feet of floor space for every foot of ground-level space dedicated to day care -- twice the bonus proposed for New York City by the Real Estate Board of New York in a package of proposals to stimulate development. New York has no mandated or optional zoning statute on day-care centers. 
The offer here meant Wright Runstad & Company, which provided a 2,000-square-foot day-care center, could add 24,000 square feet to its Washington Mutual Tower.
A moratorium that began in May 1989 and continues through next May on new down town office high-rises has prevented any fur ther use of the bonus. But developers are expected to take advantage of it in the future.

When the 1.05-million-square-foot Wash ington Mutual Tower opened in 1989, Wright Runstad advertised it as "an office building so friendly you can bring your kids to work." The day-care center, with its 22 children, 2 months to 2 1/2 years old, is tucked into a courtyard behind a fountain. The center oper ates at capacity.
The Y.W.C.A. operates the center, which is subsidized by United Way. "It's convenient for parents who work in the building," said Tema Nesoff, its assistant director. "They see what the child is doing during the day."
Costs range from $285 to $650 a month, depending on the child's age, and 30 percent of the children come from low-income fam ilies. Another concern, Harbor Development Company, lets the center use a nearby empty lot as a play area and local architects de signed outdoor equipment free of charge.
Steve Trainer, senior vice president of Wright Runstad, said his company had long wanted to place child care in downtown projects. But state law required that centers be built at street level, eliminating most towers because first floors on Seattle's hilly streets often range from below to above grade. That law has since been eased.
"This is definitely a start on what the city envisioned," said Rebecca Herzfeld, the city's manager of code development and coordination.
But Billie Young, Seattle's child-care coor dinator, noted that the costs of providing care tend to be higher downtown than in neighbor hoods. Centers downtown tend to be smaller, so there are no economies of scale that larger neighborhood centers can achieve.
Staff members are paid more to work in downtown than in the suburbs. Because par ents who want to take their children down town demand high quality in care, more staff members are needed in the city core. But proponents say that day-care centers in downtown offices tend to "humanize" the often sterile environments.
The publicity surrounding the incentive program has encouraged developers to in clude day care even if they gained their permits prior to the zoning change and thus were not entitled to a density bonus, Ms. Herzfeld said.
For example, Pacific First Centre, a Pres cott Development Company project complet ed last year, provides an 8,000-square-foot day-care center for 55 children, operated by Pacific First Montessori. The developer gave the operator a five-year lease at nominal rent.
Dick Clotfelter, president of Prescott De velopment, said he was marketing the 1.07- million-square-foot building with the day-care center as an incentive. A store in the 8,000 square feet the center occupies would have rented for about $12 a square foot, or $96,000 a year, he said.
Kelly Sandy, whose wife, Linda, works in the Pacific First building, said he felt a full day would be too tiring for his 3 1/2-year-old son, Curtis, so a nanny picks the child up after lunch. He chose the Pacific First day-care center over one near his home.
Suzanne Haggard, director of the Pacific First Montessori, took out a Small Business Administration loan to finance her school/-day-care center, which opened in mid-1989. Costs range from $550 to $750 a month, depending on age of the child.
"We're looking for new ways to finance child care and have been pushing for help from developers nationally," said Caroline Eichman, research director of the Child Care Action Campaign. "Seattle has a very good program.
She said San Francisco has seen little success so far with its five-year-old law de signed to promote child care in office build ings. It requires developers of buildings larg er than 50,000 square feet to pay $1 for every gross square foot or to set aside 2,000 square feet of floor space or 1 percent of the total area, whichever is greater.
"The law was written to entice developers to pay the fee," Ms. Eichman said, "so the city can have control over spending and community planning. "
No child-care centers have gone into new San Francisco towers, but one developer, Ron Kaufman Companies, is seeking permits for a new building that would include day care for up to 40 children. Lynne Beeson, director of the Mayor's Office of Child Care, said most developers are paying fees and the city will receive $300,000 by year's end.
"Things aren't changing fast," Ms. Beeson said. "We have got such a long way to go."
Some California cities, like Concord and Danville, have built day-care centers and also collected fees. But in Boston four new office buildings that would include child care in the once-blighted Midtown Cultural Dis trict are on hold, and the same is true of a building in Hartford. Cincinnati has had a bonus law on the books since 1987 but nothing has come about, and in Irvine, Calif., two projects still are pending.
Some of the 14 other cities now considering mandatory child-care laws are running into rebellion from developers opposed to what they see as mandatory zoning. Pittsburgh will decide about mandatory laws this fall. City planners say it is crucial to plan centers now for future buildings because of the num ber of working mothers. Pittsburgh's centers near downtown currently handle only about 680 children and planners expect that within 20 years more than 50,000 women of child-bearing age will work downtown.
"Developers across the country haven't opposed bonus laws, but they have opposed mandatory zoning," Ms. Eichman said. "They see these laws as unfair taxes and feel they're being made scapegoats. They say day care is the responsibility of employers and the community as well."
Developers say they are being singled out because their buildings will create new jobs and new demands on city services like child care. Yet, Ms. Eichman said, "we've found that communities across the country are strapped for funds, and Federal and state monies have been cut back."

HEADLINE: An Immigrant's Pain in Concrete

BYLINE: By CAROL STRICKLAND

 BODY:
''I DIDN'T plan to be a writer,'' said Pietro Di Donato, the author of 50 short stories and 6 books, including the 1939 best seller ''Christ in Concrete.''
''One day I wandered into the library and met my true friends - Zola, Balzac, Turgenev - and said: 'This is where I belong. I can do this, too.' ''
Soon after, using a borrowed typewriter, Mr. Di Donato pounded out the story of the gruesome death of his father, a man buried alive in liquid concrete in a construction accident on Good Friday in 1923.
''The book was hailed as a masterpiece, not just of ethnic literature, but of English literature,'' said Mario Mignone, chairman of the French and Italian department at the State University at Stony Brook. 
The overnight sensation created by the autobiographical novel, a Book-of-the-Month Club Main Selection, transported Mr. Di Donato, a bricklayer working on the 1939-40 World's Fair in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in Queens, ''to another world,'' he said, ''a world of sugar kings, movie actresses, multimillionaires, Popes and presidents.'' The author took to international celebrity like a child to chocolate. ''Strangely enough, I fit in everywhere,'' the writer, 79 years old, said in an interview at his home in Setauket. ''I guess I was just born author material.''
On Thursday at 8 P.M., as part of an Italian-American film festival, the New Community Cinema in Huntington will show the 1949 film based on Mr. Di Donato's novel. Its name is also ''Christ in Concrete.'' After the screening, the writer will discuss both his life and work. Although it won the Grand Masterpiece Award at the 1949 Venice Film Festival and the Paris Press Prize for direction, the film is not well known in this country.
Its director, Edward Dmytryk, who was one of the ''Hollywood 10,'' was blacklisted for refusing to cooperate with the House Un-American Activities Committee.
Although the film was not shown in the United States, its message is far from subversive.
 
First Chapter Is Dramatized
The movie dramatizes the first chapter of the novel, lyrically transforming the immigrant experience from stereotypic to stereophonic as it hits all the notes from beauty to pain in working-class life.
In the film, the lead character, Geremio, a bricklayer like Mr. Di Donato's father, is corrupted by greed and forsakes his Old World morality and pride in workmanship. Realizing his error, Geremio makes peace with his conscience and his friends, announcing:
''Man does not live for himself alone.''
In the powerful conclusion, Geremio dies when a building's shoddily constructed walls collapse.
The novel itself is ''the premiere work for the Italian-American immigrant experience,'' said Anthony De Franco, professor of English at Suffolk County Community College. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, an ardent fan of the book, keeps it on his desk in Albany, next to the Bible.
Explaining the significance of the title, Mr. Di Donato spoke of the time he addressed mental patients at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Northport and was asked, ''What do you mean by Christ in concrete?''
''Before I could marshal my palaver,'' Mr. Di Donato recalled, ''a patient answered, 'Don't you realize that any good man is a concrete Christ?'
''That was it. There's lots of bull about religion. Give me a good man or a good woman, someone we can smell, taste, kiss, embrace, hear and see. The spirit is within us.''
 
Stomachs Become Wounds
The book's lyrical style matches the elevated view of the dignity and divinity of the common man. The poetic prose is completely dissimilar, however, from the vernacular of other Depression-era novels of blue-collar life.
''In the home of Geremio, stomachs have become wounds,'' Mr. Di Donato wrote. ''In the home of Geremio, hearts have become swollen vessels and eyes ceaseless falls.''
The author of ''Christ in Concrete'' also differed from other ''proletarian'' novelists like John Steinbeck and John Dos Passos in his consistent concern for the poor. Whereas the youthful idealism of those two writers gave way to conservatism, Mr. Di Donato retained his sense of outrage at economic inequality.
''They never broke stone,'' he said of once-fiery radicals who lost their fervor. ''They all have women's fingers.'' Far from mellowing, Mr. Di Donato said: ''The older you get, the more you must become a dangerous element in society. My mind is never at rest.''
A pacifist who joined the Young Communist League the night ''the establishment murdered Sacco and Vanzetti,'' Mr. Di Donato still fulminates against the ''monstrous massacre of the Vietnam War.''
 
He Knew His Subject
In contrast to theorists and intellectuals who described working-class life without experiencing it directly, Mr. Di Donato knew his subject intimately. Only 13 when his father died, he became the sole support of his mother and seven brothers and sisters.
''I knew all about being homeless,'' Mr. Di Donato said. ''I was introduced starkly to the realities that the school or church wouldn't support us. The paesanos were all poor. We had to survive somehow or die.''
The family moved from Union City, N.J., where Mr. Di Donato was born, to the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn. In 1930, when he was working on the construction of Pilgrim State Hospital in Brentwood, he moved to Long Island.
''Northport was really idyllic,'' Mr. Di Donato recalled of the colony of political radicals, including the late I. F. Stone. ''I brought Thornton Wilder out there and said, 'This is our town.' ''
With the success of ''Christ in Concrete,'' Mr. Di Donato gave up bricklaying to become a full-time writer. He moved to Setauket after Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia had performed the ceremony in which Mr. Di Donato married Helen Dean, now deceased.
 
'Mixture of Every Nationality'
The writer's acquaintances included Che Guevara and Fidel Castro, President John F. Kennedy, Ernest Hemingway, Federico Fellini and Popes John XXIII and Paul.
Always he remembered his roots, growing up in a tenement that was ''a polyglot mixture of every nationality, so close that you could reach out and touch Ellis Island,'' Mr. Di Donato said. ''When I was a kid,'' he recalled, ''everything was larger than life. The streets were like tribal city-states, with one section from Abruzzi, another from Sicily. There wasn't this dependency on television.
''People are becoming sedentary troglodytes today. Back then, you celebrated your own tragedies and your own comedies. Life and death took place right in your own railroad flat.''
Mr. Di Donato recalled the frozen underwear, chamber pots under the bed, drying tomato paste on the tenement roof and canvas diapers. Streets turned into carnivals at religious festivals.
 
Resonance of Urban Life
''Christ in Concrete'' resonates not only with these sights, but also the sounds of urban life. As one passage puts it:
''The snoring children, the cats moaning, the milk wagons over cobblestones, the rattling Els, the whistle-rumble of the river boats.''
Mr. Di Donato renders reality without damp-eyed sentiment, unblinkingly portraying the pain of hard labor: ''The fine sharp brick dust'' that bruised the fingers, ''the hot lime mortar'' that ate into the hands, the frequent accidents on the job.
''I saw a man go flying through space,'' he reminisced of a scene the book viscerally depicts of a friend's falling from a 20-story skyscraper, his body exploding on the pavement like ''human fruit'' into a ''brilliant red wet overalled pulp.''
''I wrote it as fiction, but it's all history,'' Mr. Di Donato said.
The author, however, calls himself ''more of a missionary than a fictionist.''
''I want to impart to another human being the depths beneath the sea,'' he said. ''It's the unwritten duty of the artist to instruct his listeners so that they go away with something.''
Mr. Di Donato attributes his empathy with the downtrodden to his early role as family breadwinner.
''Being a father, brother and mother to all those kids,'' he said, ''made me extend that compassion to the underdogs of the world as though I were a god who could change injustice.
''That's the strength of my writing. There's no room for trivia or shamming. But the subject matter has to have gravity. It cannot be cotton candy. It has to be good solid bricks.''

HEADLINE: Dispelling the Gloom Over the Economy

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

DATELINE: RYE BROOK

 BODY:
THE prevailing mood was gloom as several hundred business leaders in the county gathered this month to hear Rosemary Scanlon, chief economist of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, andWilliam T. Knowles, chairman and chief executive officer of National Westminster Bancorp and chairman of the Regional Plan Association.
Ms. Scanlon acknowledged the gloom and attributed it to a decrease in construction activity and a decline in jobs in the county and the New York City region. Mr. Knowles warned that the region needed increased investment to be competitive with foreign capitals.
They were among the speakers assessing the region's economy before about 225 business leaders at the fifth yearly economic symposium sponsored by the Westchester County Association, the Westchester County Bankers Association and the Westchester Business Partnership. It was held Oct. 2 at the Rye Town Hilton here. 
Why so much gloom? Ms. Scanlon offered two reasons. First, with the exception of the manufacturing industry, the Northeast has not had a real recession in 15 years.
And in addition, she said, ''We have a whole generation of young people in the work force who have been conditioned by the boom years of the 1980's: a generation that believes jobs in the financial industry will grow automatically by 11 percent a year and that house prices that go up 20 to 25 percent a year are the norm.''
So the psychological effects of the economic downturn, she suggested, make it seem worse than it actually is.
''The numbers don't support the gloom,'' she said. ''The national economy is worse off than the economy of the region, which includes Westchester.''
Although the outlook in the county for the rest of this year and 1991 is for more job cutbacks and continued weak retail sales, and remains bleak for office and housing construction, Ms. Scanlon pointed to some small silver linings.
''Tourism, for one,'' she said. ''Hotel and air-passenger traffic is showing strength. And despite the downturn in construction, there's still a lot of construction work being done, but it's different work, smaller jobs.''
Housing prices in the region, she noted, have fallen only 10 percent from their peak. ''Yet statistics show that the median family income is still only 70 percent of what is needed to buy a medium-priced home,'' she said. ''Home prices will have to come down more before we will see action in the resale market.''
 
Tri-State Strategy Urged
The symposium's keynote speaker, Mr. Knowles, the chairman of the Regional Plan Association, called for ''a tri-state economic strategy and a common agenda.'' Explaining that the county must be considered as part of a whole, Mr. Knowles said, ''In the past, Westchester vied with New York City or Connecticut or New Jersey for new business. Now the competition for economic development is increasingly between our region and others - such as greater London or greater Tokyo - that have already taken a regional approach.''
Westchester will need considerable investment in transportation, education, housing and the environment, he said, and added that such investment far exceeds the resources of any local area.
Overseas, such efforts are usually financed by national governments or by the private sector in partnership with public agencies, he said.
''Yet, at the moment I see little commitment from the Federal Government toward keeping this region competitive with other world financial capitals,'' he said. ''It is only by banding together as a region that we can generate the vision needed to get this kind of investment.''
 
Future Growth Is Viewed
Citing changes over the last 20 years in the fundamental structure of the economy, Mr. Knowles said the industries associated with the region's role as a global command post and financial center are the dominant ones, while manufacturing had declined.
In the 1980's, tri-state area added about 200,000 new jobs a year. ''I doubt that that's sustainable,'' Mr. Knowles said. ''But we could attain growth in the late 1990's and beyond at perhaps 90,000 to 100,000 jobs a year, once the economy resumes its expansion.''
His optimism, he explained, was based on the region's position as the leading metropolis of the world's richest market (the United States), a magnet for international investment. The 31 counties making up the tri-state region have the largest concentration of national and multinational headquarters in the world, he said.
Jay N. Woodworth, vice president and senior domestic economist for Bankers Trust Company in Manhattan, offered another assessment, predicting slow growth but no hard landing.
 
Sources of Strength Cited
''I don't predict a recession,'' Mr. Woodworth said. ''I expect the economy to turn around and do a little better in 1991.''
Explaining the reason for his optimism, Mr. Woodworth said the economy was not the same as it was during the last two recessions:
''There are sources of strength in the economy, namely in consumer spending on durable goods, rising volume of exports because of the weak dollar and business capital spending for equipment. The weak links are financial services, home building and office construction.''
S. J. Schulman, president of the Westchester County Association, a businesss group, addressed a question to Mr. Knowles: ''The problems of the banking and financial industries in Manhattan are important to us here in Westchester. What effect do you think will be felt in Westchester?''
Acknowledging that there was no good news on the horizon in the financial employment sector, Mr. Knowles pointed out that the banking and financial industries had been overbuilt and at over capacity. He said that shrinkage was now to be expected.
''Mergers and acquisitions will result in greater efficiency,'' Mr. Knowles said. ''However, they will also put numbers of middle and senior managers - those people who normally buy houses - out of work. It's a long, deep valley. I don't expect the next business expansion phase to come before 1992, and then the financial industry will participate in the growth.''
In assessing the outlook for the American economy in a world troubled by the Persian Gulf crisis, Mr. Woodworth said: ''There is a difference from past oil shocks. The difference in this oil shock is that there is no fear of energy shortages by American consumers. New-car sales have remained comparatively strong through August. We will probably avoid an energy-induced recession.''
 
Job Outlook in Suburbs
Job cutbacks in the suburbs will be directly tied to the dramatic downturn in construction and slow rate of the growth in the financial industry, Ms. Scanlon said, asserting that the suburban office market has been greatly overbuilt.
''Construction contracts are down 26 percent; housing starts are down almost 50 percent,'' she added.
But Gary F. Sherlock, president and publisher of Gannett Westchester Rockland Newspapers, suggested that judging from the advertising volume of the local newspapers for the first eight months of the year, Westchester might be better off than other counties in the region.
The major problems facing the region, Mr. Knowles said, are of such magnitude that they can't be left to individual local officials. ''Widespread involvement is essential for the political muscle to get the job done,'' he said. ''Our future depends on working together.''

HEADLINE: Seattle Induces Office Builders to Include Child Care

BYLINE: By HARRIET KING

DATELINE: SEATTLE

 BODY:
The city of Seattle is beginning to get experience with the use of zoning incentives that encourage builders to provide day-care centers for the young children of office workers. The results so far suggest advantages, but at a substantial cost to users for a substantial benefit to builders.
A national study by Child Care Action Campaign, an advocacy organization based in New York City, shows that day-care centers in downtown office buildings are slow in coming, possibly because the economic climate has generally slowed development.
In four other cities that give developers density bonuses for child care - Irvine, Calif., Portland, Ore., Cincinnati and Hartford - proposed projects have been put on hold until sluggish real estate markets improve.
In the other areas where child-care centers or fees for a community day-care fund are mandatory - Clayton, Concord, Danville, Martinez, San Francisco and San Ramon, all in California, plus Boston - only a handful, mostly in California, have been built in new properties. Most developers have chosen to put money in a community child-care fund rather than meet strict codes or negotiate with day-care operators. 
In 1985, a change in the zoning code here gave builders 12 square feet of floor space for every foot of ground-level space dedicated to day care - twice the bonus proposed for New York City by the Real Estate Board of New York in a package of proposals to stimulate development. New York has no mandated or optional zoning statute on day-care centers.
The offer here meant Wright Runstad & Company, which provided a 2,000-square-foot day-care center, could add 24,000 square feet to its Washington Mutual Tower.
A moratorium that began in May 1989 and continues through next May on new downtown office high-rises has prevented any further use of the bonus. But developers are expected to take advantage of it in the future. When the 1.05-million-square-foot Washington Mutual Tower opened in 1989, Wright Runstad advertised it as ''an office building so friendly you can bring your kids to work.'' The day-care center, with its 22 children, 2 months to 2 1/2 years old, is tucked into a courtyard behind a fountain. The center operates at capacity.
The Y.W.C.A. operates the center, which is subsidized by United Way. ''It's convenient for parents who work in the building,'' said Tema Nesoff, its assistant director. ''They see what the child is doing during the day.''
Costs range from $285 to $650 a month, depending on the child's age, and 30 percent of the children come from low-income families. Another concern, Harbor Development Company, lets the center use a nearby empty lot as a play area and local architects designed outdoor equipment free of charge.
Steve Trainer, senior vice president of Wright Runstad, said his company had long wanted to place child care in downtown projects. But state law required that centers be built at street level, eliminating most towers because first floors on Seattle's hilly streets often range from below to above grade. That law has since been eased.
''This is definitely a start on what the city envisioned,'' said Rebecca Herzfeld, the city's manager of code development and coordination.
But Billie Young, Seattle's child-care coordinator, noted that the costs of providing care tend to be higher downtown than in neighborhoods. Centers downtown tend to be smaller, so there are no economies of scale that larger neighborhood centers can achieve.
Staff members are paid more to work in downtown than in the suburbs. Because parents who want to take their children downtown demand high quality in care, more staff members are needed in the city core. But proponents say that day-care centers in downtown offices tend to ''humanize'' the often sterile environments.
The publicity surrounding the incentive program has encouraged developers to include day care even if they gained their permits prior to the zoning change and thus were not entitled to a density bonus, Ms. Herzfeld said.
For example, Pacific First Centre, a Prescott Development Company project completed last year, provides an 8,000-square-foot day-care center for 55 children, operated by Pacific First Montessori. The developer gave the operator a five-year lease at nominal rent. Dick Clotfelter, president of Prescott Development, said he was marketing the 1.07- million-square-foot building with the day-care center as an incentive. A store in the 8,000 square feet the center occupies would have rented for about $12 a square foot, or $96,000 a year, he said. Kelly Sandy, whose wife, Linda, works in the Pacific First building, said he felt a full day would be too tiring for his 3 1/2-year-old son, Curtis, so a nanny picks the child up after lunch. He chose the Pacific First day-care center over one near his home. Suzanne Haggard, director of the Pacific First Montessori, took out a Small Business Administration loan to finance her school/-day-care center, which opened in mid-1989. Costs range from $550 to $750 a month, depending on age of the child.
''We're looking for new ways to finance child care and have been pushing for help from developers nationally,'' said Caroline Eichman, research director of the Child Care Action Campaign. ''Seattle has a very good program. She said San Francisco has seen little success so far with its five-year-old law designed to promote child care in office buildings. It requires developers of buildings larger than 50,000 square feet to pay $1 for every gross square foot or to set aside 2,000 square feet of floor space or 1 percent of the total area, whichever is greater.
''The law was written to entice developers to pay the fee,'' Ms. Eichman said, ''so the city can have control over spending and community planning. '' No child-care centers have gone into new San Francisco towers, but one developer, Ron Kaufman Companies, is seeking permits for a new building that would include day care for up to 40 children. Lynne Beeson, director of the Mayor's Office of Child Care, said most developers are paying fees and the city will receive $300,000 by year's end.
''Things aren't changing fast,'' Ms. Beeson said. ''We have got such a long way to go.''
Some California cities, like Concord and Danville, have built day-care centers and also collected fees. But in Boston four new office buildings that would include child care in the once-blighted Midtown Cultural District are on hold, and the same is true of a building in Hartford. Cincinnati has had a bonus law on the books since 1987 but nothing has come about, and in Irvine, Calif., two projects still are pending.
Some of the 14 other cities now considering mandatory child-care laws are running into rebellion from developers opposed to what they see as mandatory zoning. Pittsburgh will decide about mandatory laws this fall. City planners say it is crucial to plan centers now for future buildings because of the number of working mothers. Pittsburgh's centers near downtown currently handle only about 680 children and planners expect that within 20 years more than 50,000 women of child-bearing age will work downtown.
''Developers across the country haven't opposed bonus laws, but they have opposed mandatory zoning,'' Ms. Eichman said. ''They see these laws as unfair taxes and feel they're being made scapegoats. They say day care is the responsibility of employers and the community as well.''
Developers say they are being singled out because their buildings will create new jobs and new demands on city services like child care. Yet, Ms. Eichman said, ''we've found that communities across the country are strapped for funds, and Federal and state monies have been cut back.''

HEADLINE: Bankers Hoping for End To Steep Decline in Profits

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
AS Connecticut banks release their third-quarter financial results this month, industry experts say the long slide in profits should be halted although perhaps not reversed.
This quarter, more than any in recent memory, is being watched closely by banking regulators and economists, because it follows a disastrous string of quarterly results. In the last quarter, banks' profits fell more steeply in the state than anywhere else in the country, due to losses on real-estate loans.
''I think things have just about hit bottom,'' said the president of the Connecticut Bankers Association, Preston C. King.
''Banks have already written off most of their bad loans, and they haven't been writing new loans so much as they've been investing, because of the beating they took from regulators,'' Mr. King said. ''I don't think we're going to see any bankruptcies in the third quarter.'' 
No one believes that banks will be showing any significant growth in profits this quarter, but economists said that given the performance of the last year, even a halt in the downturn would be encouraging.
''Having swallowed their medicine, banks may begin to look a little better than they have been,'' said Dr. Lewis Mandell, a professor of finance at the University of Connecticut, in Storrs. ''They'll still be showing losses, but they won't be $200 million or $300 million.'' The president of the Savings Bank Association of Connecticut, Gerald M. Noonan, said one reason Connecticut's financial system will not collapse like those in Texas and California is the inherent conservatism of the Connecticut banker.
''We don't have a lot of high fliers or management that comes in to make a quick killing,'' Mr. Noonan said. ''My gut feeling is the worst of our problem is behind us. The economy may still be in a slide, which will affect profitability. But profitability really hasn't been the culprit the last few quarters. It's been these tremendous real-estate write-downs.''
The tough times may not be quite over, however. Banking officials say a slowing economy and the accompanying layoffs could bring a new round of residential foreclosures, with banks ending up with houses they cannot sell.
And Dr. Mandell said banks still have one problem that has not surfaced. For the last several quarters, one of the few areas where banks have been able to make money has been in credit cards, he said.
''In order to milk that business for all that it's worth, they've been pushing those cards on marginal borrowers,'' Dr. Mandell said. Those customers who are poor credit risks will default in huge numbers as the economy continues to cool down, he said.
''When the credit-card crash hits the banks, then you'll see them really suffering,'' Dr. Mandell said. ''And I think that's going to hit by the spring of next year.''
Banks are also coming under increasing criticism because they have responded to increasing regulatory pressure by getting out of the mortgage business, experts said, which has hurt small businesses.
''It's as if the banks suddenly ran out of money,'' said the president of the Connecticut Small Business Federation, Leon Lemaire, ''and we know they haven't. They're just afraid.''
Mr. Lemaire said he knows of one man who owns the small shopping complex where he operates a package store. Though he had never defaulted on a payment and had no mortgage on his business or his house, in Glastonbury, the man's bank refused to renew his credit line recently, even though the rents from his shopping center would have more than covered the payments, Mr. Lemaire said.
 
'Sense of Antagonism'
''I thought banks were supposed to be in the mortgage business,'' he said. ''But somehow, all of a sudden, you get a sense of antagonism when you're dealing with banks.''
Seven of the top 20 banks in the state showed losses in 1989, and even at those that stayed in the black, profits were generally weak, totaling just over $200 million, compared with losses of almost $600 million at the others.
The situation has continued to deteriorate. Under results reported late last month by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Connecticut banks showed a net loss of $103 million, down from a net profit of about $39 million during the same period in 1989. It was the worst decline in the 50 states. Only one other Northeast state, New Hampshire, showed a net loss.
New England is undergoing ''a real recession,'' said the chairman of the F.D.I.C., L. William Seidman, as he announced the results.
Savings institutions have not had it any easier, reporting losses of almost $200 million during the second quarter. Mr. Noonan said the thrifts suffered problems similar to those of the state's residents. Throughout the late 1970's and early 1980's, when inflation was high, people with conservative investments looked with envy at the high returns made by the risk takers.
''After five or six years, even the most prudent people felt foolish,'' Mr. Noonan said. ''It wore down the conservative approach our bankers had taken for years.''
Mr. King said Connecticut's commercial banks also had little time to position themselves for the economic downturn that has affected the state. Because of mergers and acquisitions, only 28 of the 68 banks in the state in 1980 are still around today, but there are 71 banks now.
''Almost 60 percent of Connecticut's banks are less than six years old,'' Mr. King said. ''There's no other state in America with those kinds of statistics.''
 
Bigger Problems Elsewhere
Another problem that bankers cite is that regulators who dealt with the more-serious problems of the Southwest came to Connecticut last year and imposed strict new rules on writing off the losses that have affected banks' balance sheet.
Connecticut's problems, bankers agree, are far less serious than those in Texas and California. Texas alone has 86 failed savings-and-loan associations; bailing them out will cost $23.2 billion. California has 28 such institutions and the bail-out bill is expected to approach $36 billion.
But Connecticut banks have had their problems. Several that issued stock in the mid-1980's at prices from $10 to $20 a share are now trading at around $1. And several former industry leaders are struggling to overcome serious losses.
Under Securities and Exchange Commission regulations, bank officials cannot comment on their third-quarter performance until the profit-and-loss figures are announced, but there is general optimism.
Connecticut Bank and Trust, for instance, showed a loss last year of $355 million, more than the combined profits of all the top 20 banks in the state that finished in the black last year. It ended the first quarter of this year with a profit, then slipped back into the red in the period from April to June.
 
Recovery Is 'Under Way'
But a spokesman for the bank, Richard J. DeNoia, said it is still ahead $16 million for the first six months of the year, and is bringing out several new checking and savings products that it hopes will buoy its fortunes. ''We feel that our recovery is well under way,'' said Mr. DeNoia. At Connecticut National Bank, which showed a loss of $128.9 million last year (like Connecticut Bank and Trust, because of a fourth-quarter write-off), a spokeswoman, Margaret Root, said the bank posted profits of almost $71 million in this year's first and second quarters.
''There were some real surprises in the second quarter,'' Mr. King said. ''A lot of banks that were profitable in the first quarter showed a loss, and a lot of banks that showed a loss in the first quarter turned a profit. That's why everyone's so interested in what's going to happen in the third quarter, because so far, we can't see any kind of a trend emerging.''
Dr. Mandell said that while the banks' flow of red ink might be staunched in the third quarter, ''I really don't see any parts of their business that are going to be picking up soon.''

HEADLINE: Life Savings During Wartime

BYLINE: By JOSEPH NOCERA; Joseph Nocera is writing a history of personal finance.

DATELINE: NORTHAMPTON, Mass.

 BODY:
''The crisis,'' screamed the cover of Time magazine a few weeks ago: ''What to Do With Your Money.'' Imagine that: what to do with my money. Saddam Hussein had invaded Kuwait; America was rushing troops to Saudi Arabia. And someone was going to tell me where to put my money.
The story turned out to be written by that guru of personal finance, Andrew Tobias, who explained that if you had been smart enough to take advantage of the crisis by shorting stocks, you would have made a fortune. ''In July,'' he wrote breezily, ''you could have bought I.B.M. October 100 puts for $25 each and sold them for $560 when the Middle East tension was at its height a month later. Twenty times your money in a month!'' 
Although Mr. Tobias didn't take this thought to its logical conclusion, it's not hard to do: If you can make this much when there's only ''tension,'' imagine how rich you can get if an actual war breaks out!
The Tobias article is part of an emerging genre that has developed since Iraq invaded Kuwait. ''Money- management-in-wartime,'' you might call it. And you see it everywhere.
''Within hours of the first gunfire,'' predicted one magazine, ''look for stock prices to fall 150 points or more on the Dow.'' I got a mailgram from Shearson Lehman Brothers. ''Mid East Crisis'' it began, ''how will it affect your investments.'' I ran a computer search on news articles that contained both the phrases ''Saddam Hussein'' and ''stock market.'' There were well over 500 entries.
It is difficult to read this new genre without feeling that our priorities have gone terribly askew. To be sure, the bear market is here. But even so, it's amazing that we can obsess about money at a time like this without even a hint of remorse. Has there ever been a time when so many people have been so unabashed about viewing the possibility of war through the prism of their own personal finances? I think not.
Why is this happening now? It's happening because of two trends. The first has to do with the markets, which have become part of the daily life of the middle class. As recently as 20 years ago most Americans kept their money in the bank, where it earned a federally regulated (low) rate of interest.
Today, the situation is different. The raging inflation of a decade ago, the deregulation of interest rates, the 1980's bull market, the rise of the mutual fund industry have all forced the broad middle class to become investors. For instance, 60 million Americans have money in a mutual fund, up from 12 million only 10 years ago. The affect on the stock market of a war, should it come to that, will hurt millions of people.
That those millions will talk about this out loud speaks to a second, far more lamentable, trend: the continuing division of America into haves and have-nots. It's not much of an exaggeration to say that one large segment of society owns mutual funds while the other fights wars.
It's a commonplace view by now that the Vietnam War was fought by the poor while the rich evaded the draft. But at least there was a draft then: at least people from all classes were forced to confront the consequences of war. Yes, the war brought inflation, but the national agenda was dominated by the more compelling issues of the war's purpose. Americans may have disagreed about the answer, but there can be no doubt that that's what they thought about.
And now? Now, with no draft the haves no longer really have to think about purpose, or death, if they don't want to. The growing insularity of Americans also comes into play here: most of the mutual fund class not only have no connection to the military themselves, they don't even know anybody who does. For them, war has entered the realm of the theoretical, except in one area: their personal finances. So that's what they talk about, never reflecting about how cruel all this money talk must sound to those who have sons and daughters stationed in Saudi Arabia.
It's probably true that the Dow Jones average will drop 150 points if fighting breaks out. But so what? If it does come to that, what will matter is that Americans will be fighting and dying. Common decency alone would suggest that that's the only thing that should matter. To our everlasting shame, that is no longer the case.

HEADLINE: Leonard Bernstein, 72, Music's Monarch, Dies

BYLINE: By DONAL HENAHAN

 BODY:
Leonard Bernstein, one of the most prodigally talented and successful musicians in American history, died yesterday evening at his apartment at the Dakota on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. He was 72 years old.
Mr. Bernstein's spokeswoman, Margaret Carson, said he died of a heart attack caused by progressive lung failure.
His death followed by five days the announcement that Mr. Bernstein would retire from performing because of health problems. A heavy smoker for most of his life, he had been suffering from emphysema, pulmonary infections and a pleural tumor. 
In recent months, Mr. Bernstein had canceled concerts in Japan and in Charleston, S.C., and a tour of Europe. He conducted his final performance at Tanglewood on Aug. 19, when he led the Boston Symphony in Britten's ''Four Sea Interludes'' and the Beethoven Seventh Symphony.
 
'Fated for Success'
Long before Mr. Bernstein became, at the age of 40, the youngest music director ever engaged by the New York Philharmonic, the drama critic Harold Clurman sized up the flamboyant musician's future: ''Lenny is hopelessly fated for success.''
It was Mr. Bernstein's fate to be far more than routinely successful, however. His fast-burning energies, his bewildering versatility and his profuse gifts for both music and theater coalesced to make him a high-profile figure in a dozen fields, among them symphonic music, Broadway musicals, the ballet, films and television.
Still, his hydra-headed success did not please all his critics. While he was music director of the Philharmonic from 1959 to 1969, some friends and critics urged him to quit and compose theater music full time. Many regarded him as potentially the savior of the American musical, to which he contributed scores for ''On the Town,'' ''Wonderful Town,'' ''Candide'' and ''West Side Story.''
 
Determining His Focus
At the same time, others were deploring his continued activity in such fields, contending that to be a successful leader of a major orchestra he would have to focus on conducting.
Still other observers of the Bernstein phenomenon wished he would concentrate on the ballet, for which he had shown an affinity (''Fancy Free,'' ''Facsimile''), or on opera and operetta (''Trouble in Tahiti,'' ''Candide'').
Or on musical education. His television programs on such subjects as conducting, symphonic music and jazz fascinated millions when he appeared on ''Omnibus,'' the cultural series, and later as star of the Philharmonic's televised Young People's Concerts.
And still others, a loyal few, counseled Mr. Bernstein to throw it all over and compose more serious symphonic scores. His gifts along this line were apparent in such works as his Symphony No. 1 (''Jeremiah'') of 1942, Symphony No. 2 (''The Age of Anxiety'') of 1949 and Symphony No. 3 (''Kaddish'') of 1963. He played the piano well enough to have made a separate career as a virtuoso. He was a facile poet. He wrote several books, including the popular ''The Joy of Music'' (1959). He was a teacher of rare communicative talent, as television audiences discovered.
But Mr. Bernstein resolutely resisted pressure to restrict his activities. During his decade as the Philharmonic's musical director, he grew steadily as an interpreter and as a technician.
His performances of Mahler's symphonies were almost universally conceded to be of the highest quality, and his recordings for Columbia Records of the complete set not only constituted the first such integral collection but also continue to be regarded as among the most idiomatic Mahler performances available. His obsession with that composer, in fact, has been credited with generating the Mahler boom in America.
His conducting of works by Classical composers like Mozart and Haydn, often derided in his earlier days, attracted more and more praise as his career unfolded and he could relax a little. ''There is nothing Lenny can't do supremely well,'' an acquaintance remarked several years ago, ''if he doesn't try too hard.''
The future Renaissance man of American music was born in Lawrence, Mass., on Aug. 25, 1918, the son of Samuel and Jennie Resnick Bernstein. His father, a beauty-supplies jobber who had come to the United States from Russia as a boy, wanted Leonard to take over the business when he grew up. For many years the father resisted his son's intention to be a musician.
The stories of how he discovered music became encrusted with legend over the years, but all sources agree he was a prodigy. Mr. Bernstein's own version was that when he was 10 years old his Aunt Clara, who was in the middle of divorce proceedings, sent her upright piano to the Bernstein home to be stored. The child looked at it, hit the keys and cried: ''Ma, I want lessons!''
Until he was 16, by his own testimony, he had never heard a live symphony orchestra, a late start for any musician, let alone a future musical director of the Philharmonic. Virgil Thomson, while music critic of The New York Herald Tribune in the 1940's, commented on this:
''Whether Bernstein will become in time a traditional conductor or a highly personal one is not easy to prophesy. He is a consecrated character, and his culture is considerable. It might just come about, though, that, having to learn the classic repertory the hard way, which is to say after 15, he would throw his cultural beginnings away and build toward success on a sheer talent for animation and personal projection. I must say he worries us all a little bit.'' These themes - the concern over Mr. Bernstein's ''talent for animation'' and over his penchant for ''personal projection'' - were to haunt the musician through much of his career.
 
Economy of Motion Not His Virtue
As for ''animation,'' that theme tended to dominate much of the criticism of Mr. Bernstein as a conductor, particularly in his youthful days. Although he studied conducting in Philadelphia at the Curtis Institute with Fritz Reiner, whose precise but tiny beat was a trademark of his work, Mr. Bernstein's own exuberant podium style seemed modeled more on that of Serge Koussevitzky, the Boston Symphony's music director. The neophyte maestro churned his arms about in accordance with some inner message, largely ignoring the clear semaphoric techniques described in textbooks. Often, in moments of excitement, he would leave the podium entirely, rising like a rocket, arms flung aloft in indication of triumphal climax.
So animated, in fact, was Mr. Bernstein's conducting style at this point in his career that it could cause problems. At his first rehearsal for a guest appearance with the St. Louis Symphony, his initial downbeat so startled the musicians that they simply looked in amazement and made no sound.
Like another prodigally gifted American artist, George Gershwin, Mr. Bernstein divided his affections between the ''serious'' European tradition of concert music and the ''popular'' American brand. Like Gershwin, he was at home in jazz, boogie-woogie and the cliches of Tin Pan Alley, but he far outstripped his predecessor in general musical culture.
In many aspects of his life and career, Mr. Bernstein was an embracer of diversity. The son of Jewish immigrants, he retained a lifelong respect for Hebrew and Jewish culture. His ''Jeremiah'' and ''Kaddish'' symphonies and several other works were founded on the Old Testament. But he also acquired a deep respect for Roman Catholicism, which was reflected in his ''Mass,'' the 1971 work he wrote for the opening of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington.
A similar catholicity was reflected throughout his music. His choral compositions include not only songs in Hebrew but also ''Harvard Songs: Dedication and Lonely Men of Harvard.'' He was graduated in 1939 from Harvard, where he had studied composition with Walter Piston and Edward Burlingame Hill.
A sense of his origins, however, remained strong. Koussevitzky proclaimed him a genius and probable future musical director of the Boston Symphony - ''The boy is a new Koussevitzky, a reincarnation!'' - but the older conductor urged Mr. Bernstein to improve his chances for success by changing his name. The young musician replied: ''I'll do it as Bernstein or not at all!''
He pronounced the name in the German way, as BERN-stine, and could no more abide the pronounciation BERN-steen than he could enjoy being called ''Lenny'' by casual acquaintances.
In a sense, he was in lifelong flight from Lenny Bernstein, from being treated as the raffish ''ordinary guy'' that the nickname seemed to suggest. Although some elder members of the New York Philharmonic never stopped calling him Lenny, Mr. Bernstein lived down the nickname, and in his late years heard himself addressed almost reverentially as ''Maestro'' in the world's music capitals. The man who had been patronized in print for many years as ''Glamourpuss'' or ''Wunderkind of the Western World'' became a favorite of Vienna both as conductor and as accompanist for such lieder specialists as Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and Christa Ludwig.
Fame brought the usual honorary degrees, and honors far beyond the usual. He not only conducted at La Scala in Milan, at the Metropolitan Opera and at the Staatsoper in Vienna, but he was also invited by Harvard in 1973 to lecture, as Charles Eliot Norton Professor of History, on linguistics as applied to musical analysis. The distinction had previously been conferred on Robert Frost, T. S. Eliot, Igor Stravinsky, Aaron Copland and Paul Hindemith. Typically, Mr. Bernstein's Harvard performance was greeted with a mingling of critical raves and boos.
Harvard played an important part in Mr. Bernstein's rise, providing a pinch of Brahminism. The boy whose bar mitzvah was at Temple Mishkan Tefila had gone on to the elite Boston Latin School, and graduated cum laude from Harvard with a B.A.
During his last semester at Harvard, he organized and led a performance of Marc Blitzstein's ''Cradle Will Rock,'' a left-wing musical that had been banned in Massachusetts, but that could not be proscribed within the academic walls. It was not his first fling as a producer. At age 16 he had starred in his own production of ''Carmen'' at a summer camp, playing the title role alluringly in wig and black gown.
It was as a result of another schoolboy production, at Camp Onota in the Berkshires, that he met Adolph Green, with whom he later collaborated in several Broadway musicals. Mr. Bernstein was a camp counselor and theater director and Mr. Green was in ''The Pirates of Penzance.''
 
An Unlikely Start For a Conductor
Subsequently, when Mr. Bernstein was out of a job in New York City, he looked up Mr. Green, moved in with him in his East Ninth Street apartment in Greenwich Village, and began playing the piano at the Village Vanguard for a group called the Revuers. The ensemble included, besides Mr. Green, his musical comedy collaborator Betty Comden and the actress Judy Holliday.
Mr. Bernstein met Aaron Copland at Harvard in 1937, and through him came to know two other aspiring composers, Roy Harris and William Schuman. Admiring his intuitive grasp of modern music and his phenomenal skill at playing complex orchestral scores on the piano, the composers agreed that Mr. Bernstein should become a conductor. Dimitri Mitropoulos, the New York Philharmonic's music director, met Mr. Bernstein in 1938 and added to the consensus.
At that point, Mr. Bernstein ''didn't know a baton from a tree trunk,'' as he later put it.
Nevertheless, he had made up his mind. Because he had applied at the wrong time of the year and was turned down by the Juilliard School, he went to Philadelphia to audition for Reiner's conducting class at the Curtis Institute. The Hungarian maestro opened a score in the middle, put it on the piano and told Mr. Bernstein to play until he could recognize the piece.
The aspiring conductor, who was having difficulty seeing the music because he was suffering from an allergic reaction to Copland's cat, nevertheless discerned that the work was the ''Academic Festival'' Overture of Brahms. He was accepted.
At Curtis, he studied conducting with Reiner and piano with Isabella Vengerova. His earlier piano teachers included a neighbor, Freida Karp, Helen Coates and Heinrich Gebhard. In 1940 he went to Tanglewood, where he studied at the Berkshire Music Center with Koussevitzky, who quickly adopted Mr. Bernstein and called him Lenyushka.
In later years, Mr. Bernstein prided himself on having retained the respect and friendship of both Koussevitzky and Reiner, who held virtually opposing ideas about what a conductor should do and how he should do it. But the story as the famously irascible Reiner told it to acquaintances was different: ''He didn't leave me for Koussevitzky - I threw him out.''
In truth, not all of Mr. Bernstein's associations with elder colleagues were warm and collegial. In John Gruen's biographical ''The Private World of Leonard Bernstein,'' published in 1968, Mr. Bernstein asserted that Artur Rodzinski had once pinned him against the wall of a dressing room, trying to choke him because of jealousy over the young assistant's flair for publicity. But according to Mr. Bernstein, Rodzinski had by this time become somewhat peculiar: he always carried a gun in his back pocket, for instance, for psychological support when he faced the orchestra.
 
A Boycott Causes Stumble at the Start
It was Rodzinski, however, who gave Mr. Bernstein his chance at conducting the New York Philharmonic at a lean time when the young man was scraping along as a musician in New York. When he was 22, Mr. Bernstein had been offered a guest-conducting engagement with the Boston Symphony by Koussevitzky but had been forced to refuse. The American Federation of Musicians, to which Mr. Bernstein belonged, advised its members to boycott the Boston Symphony, the last of the major orchestras remaining unorganized. Mr. Bernstein tried to mark time by opening a teaching studio in Boston, he later recalled, but ''nobody came.''
That fall, he moved to New York, where he fared hardly better.
Eventually he got a $25-a-week job at Harms-Remick, a music-publishing house, where his duties included listening to Coleman Hawkins and Earl (Fatha) Hines, and getting their jazz down on paper. He also wrote popular arrangements under the name of Lenny Amber (Bernstein in English).
The Philharmonic offer by Rodzinski came without warning. Rodzinski had heard Mr. Bernstein conduct a rehearsal at Tanglewood, remembered the young man, and after an hour's discussion, had hired him as an assistant for the 1943-44 season.
Assistant conductors by tradition do a great deal of assisting, but not much conducting. Destiny had other plans for Leonard Bernstein, however, and when opportunity knocked one Sunday afternoon in 1943, he was ready to open the door. On Nov. 14, Bruno Walter fell ill and could not conduct the Philharmonic. The young assistant took over his program (works by Schumann, Rosza, Strauss and Wagner) and achieved a sensational success. Because the concert was broadcast over radio and a review appeared on page 1 of The New York Times the next day, the name of Leonard Bernstein suddenly became known throughout the country.
''Typical Lenny luck,'' some longtime Bernstein observers said. But Mr. Bernstein had given luck a hand: Knowing that Walter was not feeling well, he had studied the program's scores especially hard, just in case. At 25, he had become a somebody in the symphonic world.
After that break, though he was still more then a decade away from becoming music director of the Philharmonic, Mr. Bernstein began to consolidate his gains. He put in three exciting but financially unproductive seasons (1945-48) as conductor of the New York City Symphony. He received no fee, and neither did the soloists.
 
In 40's, Celebrity And Back Muscles
In the late 1940's Mr. Bernstein bloomed as a public figure. He came to be a familiar sight at the Russian Tea Room, at Lindy's and at Reuben's. Columnists reported that he liked boogie-woogie, the rumba and the conga, and that female admirers swooned when he stepped on the podium.
Tallulah Bankhead once watched Mr. Bernstein conduct a Tanglewood rehearsal and said to him in her husky baritone: ''Darling, I have gone mad over your back muscles. You must come and have dinner with me.''
Just about everyone in those years wanted Mr. Bernstein. The United States Chamber of Commerce named him as one of the outstanding men of the year, along with Nelson A. Rockefeller and John Hersey. His fans, it was reported, ripped at his clothes and attacked him in his car. Paramount tested him for the title part in a film about Tchaikovsky, but he was turned down, according to the conductor, because ''my ears were too big.''
Mr. Bernstein, in fact, looked the part of a pop idol with his strong profile and wavy black hair.
Musically, his career was on the upswing, too. In 1947 he conducted a complete Boston Symphony concert as a guest, the first time in Koussevitzky's 22-year reign that any other conductor had been permitted to do that in Carnegie Hall. He served as musical adviser of the Israel Philharmonic Symphonic Orchestra for the 1948-49 season. He was a member of the Berkshire Music Center from 1948 and head of its conducting department from 1951. He served as professor of music at Brandeis University from 1951 to 1956.
In 1953 Mr. Bernstein became the first American-born conductor to be engaged by La Scala in Milan, Italy's foremost opera house, leading a performance of Cherubini's ''Medea'' with Maria Callas in the title role.
During the six-year tenure of Mitropoulos as music director of the Philharmonic, beginning in the 1951-52 season, Mr. Bernstein was a frequent guest conductor. In 1957-58, the two worked jointly as principal conductors of the orchestra. A year later, Mr. Bernstein was named music director.
The New York appointment would have been a severe test of any conductor. The orchestra's quality had gone downhill, its repertory had stagnated and audiences had fallen off. Orchestra morale was low and still sinking. Mr. Bernstein leaped in with his customary brio and showmanship and his willingness to try new ideas.
He designated the Thursday evening concerts as ''Previews,'' at which he spoke informally to the audience about the music. He built his season around themes like ''Schumann and the Romantic Movement'' and ''Keys to the 20th Century.'' Strange-sounding works by avant-garde composers like Elliott Carter, Milton Babbitt, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Gunther Schuller and John Cage began to infiltrate the Philharmonic's programs. He took the orchestra on tours to Latin America, Europe, Japan, Alaska and Canada.
It sometimes seemed that Mr. Bernstein could not possibly squeeze in one more engagement, one more social appearance. During one particularly busy stretch, he conducted 25 concerts in 28 days. His conducting style accurately reflected his breathless race through life. Although in later years he toned down his choreographic manner, he remained one of the more consistently elevating conductors of his time. That irrepressible buoyancy sometimes led to trouble: in 1982 he fell off the stand in Houston while conducting Tchaikovsky and two years later encored that frightening stunt while leading the Vienna Philharmonic in Chicago. The worst injury he suffered, however, was a bruise from a medallion he wore around his neck.
Throughout his Philharmonic years, he kept his ties with Broadway and the show-business friends he had made before he became an internationally adulated maestro. He had already written music for the musical version of ''Peter Pan'' (1950) and ''The Lark,'' a play starring Julie Harris (1955). For Hollywood, he wrote the score to ''On the Waterfront'' (1954). Musical successes on the stage followed: ''On the Town'' (1944), ''Wonderful Town'' (1953), ''Candide'' (1956) and ''West Side Story'' (1957). Several of the stage works continue to thrive: in 1985 Mr. Bernstein conducted a quasi-operatic version of ''West Side Story'' (the cast included Kiri Te Kanawa and Jose Carreras) that pleased him immensely and introduced the work to a new generation of listeners.
Then there were the ballets ''Fancy Free'' (1944) and ''Facsimile'' (1946); the song cycles ''I Hate Music'' and ''La Bonne Cuisine''; the ''Jeremiah'' and ''Age of Anxiety'' symphonies; the one-act opera ''Trouble in Tahiti''; Serenade for violin and string orchestra with percussion; the Symphony No. 3 (''Kaddish''), and the ''Chichester Psalms.''
In the years after he had left the music directorship of the Philharmonic to become the orchestra's laureate conductor, he returned to the theater. He created the ecumenical and controversial ''Mass'' and, with Jerome Robbins, the ballet ''Dybbuk,'' staged by the New York City Ballet in 1974.
Mr. Bernstein's life took a turn toward greater stability in 1951 when he married the actress Felicia Montealegre Cohn. Her American father had been head of the American Smelting and Refining Company in Chile and she had been sent to New York City to study the piano. After several years of off-and-on romance, they were married in Boston. They had three children: a daughter, Jamie, a son, Alexander Serge (named for Serge Koussevitzky) and a second daughter, Nina.
In addition to his children, who all live in New York City, and his mother, of Brookline, Mass., Mr. Bernstein is survived by a sister, Shirley Bernstein of New York City, and a brother, Burton, of Bridgewater, Conn.
Mr. Bernstein and his wife began a ''trial separation'' after 25 years of marriage. They continued, however, to appear together in concerts, one such occasion being a program in tribute to Alice Tully at Alice Tully Hall, where Mr. Bernstein conducted Sir William Walton's ''Facade'' with his wife as one of the two narrators. Mrs. Bernstein died in 1978 after a long illness.
After leaving the music director's post with the Philharmonic in 1969, Mr. Bernstein hardly curtailed his frantic activities. He continued to guest-conduct, to record for Columbia Records, to conduct at the Metropolitan Opera and to play the piano for lieder recitalists. His company, Amberson Productions, which he had formed with his friend Schuyler G. Chapin to handle his diverse interests, expanded into the new field of videocassettes.
Mr. Bernstein, a longtime Democrat and liberal, took a deep interest in politics and was a friend of the Kennedys. His ''Mass'' was dedicated to John F. Kennedy. Among guests at fund-raising parties in his apartment during the late 1960's, one could find some of the leading civil-rights advocates of the period, a form of hospitality that inspired the writer Tom Wolfe to coin the term ''radical chic.'' In his book ''Radical Chic & Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers,'' Mr. Wolfe described a fund-raising party that Mr. Bernstein gave for the Black Panthers.
During Mr. Bernstein's Philharmonic decade, the orchestra engaged its first black member, the violinist Sanford Allen.
He continued composing, if only in spurts. Late works included ''Jubilee Games,'' ''Arias and Barcarolles,'' ''Halil'' and a sequel to his opera ''Trouble in Tahiti'' entitled ''A Quiet Place.'' After its premiere in Houston in 1983, ''A Quiet Place'' was produced at the Vienna State Opera, La Scala and the Kennedy Center in Washington.
Almost to the time of his death, Mr. Bernstein carried on a bewildering variety of activities, rushing about the world with the same tireless abandon that had characterized his life in the days when he was churning out a hit a season on Broadway.
But Broadway had changed by the time Mr. Bernstein's final theatrical score reached the Mark Hellinger Theater in March 1976. The long-awaited work that he and Alan Jay Lerner had composed, ''1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,'' closed after seven performances.
He turned up in Israel, where the Israel Philharmonic was putting on a Leonard Bernstein retrospective festival to celebrate the 30th anniversary of his debut on an Israeli podium. During a two-week period, his music was heard in concert halls, theaters, movie houses and other auditoriums all over the country. In 1988, when he was 70 years old, Mr. Bernstein was named laureate conductor of the Israeli orchestra. That birthday year brought honors from all directions, but none seemed to gratify him more than the celebration staged for him at the Tanglewood Festival, scene of so many triumphs early in his career. On Nov. 14, 1988, to mark the 45th anniversary of his Philharmonic conducting debut, he led the orchestra in an all-Bernstein concert.
Laurel wreaths continued to shower on him in his last decades. Elected to the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters in 1982, he was awarded the Academy's Gold Medal three years later. The city of Milan, home of La Scala, also gave him its Gold Medal.
A discordant note sounded in 1989 when he refused to accept a medal from the Bush Administration, apparently as a protest against what he regarded as censorship of an AIDS exhibition by the National Endowment for the Arts. Like many other artists and public figures, he contributed his services at concerts to benefit the fight against AIDS.
Mr. Bernstein's private life, long the subject of rumors in the musical world, became an open book in 1987 when his homosexuality was brought to wide public attention by Joan Peyser's ''Bernstein: A Biography.''
 
As Age Advances, The Pace Does Too
Far from slowing down as age encroached, Mr. Bernstein seemed to accelerate. Last Christmas he led a performance of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony in Berlin to celebrate the crumbling of the wall between East and West Germany. With typical flair, he substituted the word ''Freiheit'' (''Freedom'') for the poet's ''Freude'' (''Joy'') in the choral finale. The East German Government bestowed on him its Star of People's Friendship Medal.
Although he had reportedly refused an offer to return to the New York Philharmonic as music director, he was scheduled to conduct six weeks of concerts for the next few seasons. Before collapsing from exhaustion this year in Japan, Mr. Bernstein had taken part in the Pacific Music Festival.
Late in his extraordinarily restless and fruitful life, Mr. Bernstein defended his early decision to spread himself over as many fields of endeavor as he could master. ''I don't want to spend my life, as Toscanini did, studying and restudying the same 50 pieces of music,'' he wrote in The Times.
''It would,'' he continued, ''bore me to death. I want to conduct. I want to play the piano. I want to write for Hollywood. I want to write symphonic music. I want to keep on trying to be, in the full sense of that wonderful word, a musician. I also want to teach. I want to write books and poetry. And I think I can still do justice to them all.''

HEADLINE: Rule of Thumb for Negotiating A Budget: 'Don't Tax Friends'

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 14

 BODY:
While the big battles over Medicare, capital gains and income tax rates have been blocking a budget agreement between Congress and the White House, dozens of backroom deals and horse trades on lesser matters have helped shape the deficit reduction packages lawmakers will vote on this week.
The White House chief of staff, John H. Sununu, alluded to one such deal today when he noted that the Administration liked the $3.4 billion in tax breaks for the oil and gas industry incorporated into the bipartisan plan that the Senate Finance Committee approved early Saturday. Those tax breaks, notably absent from the plan produced by House Democrats, are the work of Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who is chairman of the Senate panel.
In Texas, the energy industry matters. In the Senate, bipartisan support does, too, and so Mr. Bentsen also attended to the needs of certain important members of his committee. For example, there was the 10 percent luxury tax for expensive cars, boats, airplanes, furs and jewelry proposed by both the Finance Committee and House Democrats. 
 
A Difference on Small Planes
The House measure would apply the tax to all private airplanes that cost more than $100,000. The Senate Finance Committee plan would apply only to planes that cost more than $250,000 and would exempt planes used more than 80 percent of the time for business purposes.
Why the difference? Two major producers of small planes, the Cessna Aircraft Company and the Beech Aircraft Corporation, are in Kansas, home state of the Senate Republican leader, Bob Dole, who also happens to be a member of the finance panel.
''With an exemption like that, it's going to be pretty difficult to find some poor miserable private airplane owner who is actually going to be subject to this tax,'' said one tax lobbyist who has been following the committee's deliberations.
 
A Change on Fur Tax
The $100,000 luxury tax threshold for boats was originally set at $30,000, back when Congressional leaders and White House officials were huddled behind the closed doors of the budget negotiations. But as one lawmaker involved in the deliberations explained, the $30,000 limit caused a problem for the boat building industry of Maine, home of another important Senator, George J. Mitchell, the Senate majority leader and also a member of the Finance Committee.
''I urged a higher threshold as did several others,'' Mr. Mitchell said, adding that the figure bounced around considerably in the early negotiations.
As for the House Democrats, who have taken pains to fashion a plan raising taxes on the wealthy, their luxury tax contains a curious anomaly: a levy on furs with prices of $10,000 and up.
Until last Thursday, the figure was $5,000 or more, as in both the negotiated plan and the Senate Finance plan. But by Friday, when the House Ways and Means Committee chairman, Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, unveiled the final version of the Democratic plan, the threshold for furs had crept up to $10,000.
According to a person familiar with the fur industry, the change was made after several fur company owners convinced members on the Ways and Means panel that middle-class consumers would be shut out of the fur buying market entirely if the tax applied to furs priced as low as $5,000.
''They told members that it was really only at $10,000 that you began to hit the luxury furs like minks and sables,'' said this person, who spoke on the condition of anonimity.
 
The Issues of Gasoline
One of the the most visible and politically sensitive tax decisions lawmakers will have to make this week is on gasoline taxes, and the the House Democratic plan and Senate Finance Committee plan differ drastically.
House Democrats, pitching their plan to working people, have managed to avoid any gasoline tax increase at all. The Finance Committee would raise the current 9-cent-a-gallon excise tax by 9.5 cents over the next three years.
Mr. Bentsen is hardly a fan of gasoline taxes, given the driving habits in Texas and other large Western states, but to win Republican votes on the committee he had to have some way to find the revenue House Democrats gained by raising income tax rates for the wealthy. The trade-off cost him the vote of a traditional Democratic ally, Senator Max Baucus of Montana.
Mr. Baucus, who is facing re-election this year, would have supported higher tax rates on the wealthy, his spokesman said, but he felt he could not back an increase in the gasoline tax.
Both Mr. Bentsen and Mr. Mitchell today defended the bipartisan Finance Committee package as a significant improvement over the budget summit agreement approved two weeks ago,, but both made it clear that their commitment of support did not necessarily extend beyond the Senate floor.
 
'We're Committed'
''When we go to the floor we're committed to hold the package together,'' Mr. Bentsen said in an interview on the ABC News program ''This Week.''
''When you go to the conference, there has to be give on both sides,'' he said, referring to the committee where the Senate negotiators will have to work out a compromise with the House Democratic plan.''
Both Mr. Sununu, who appeared on the NBC News program ''Meet the Press,'' and Vice President Dan Quayle tried meanwhile to make the best of an increasingly difficult situation for the President and the Republican Party, seeking to blame Congress for the budget delays and to focus attention on other tax increases in the House Democratic plan.
Mr. Quayle, interviewed on the CBS News program ''Face the Nation,'' said the House Democratic plan would mean ''a whopping new tax on the middle class'' because of provisions that delay for a year the inflation adjustments in tax brackets and tax exemptions.
 
Swapping in Negotiations
Some of the most important horse trading occurred more than a month ago, when the budget negotiators from the White House and Congress, meeting in seculsion at Andrews Air Force Base, worked out a plan of tax increases that included the new levy on luxuries and increases in excise taxes on cigarettes, beer, wine and spirits.
The tobacco industry, one of the most powerful interest groups in Washington, fared better in the wheeling and dealing than even its own executives had dared hope. In early discussions, lawmakers had talked of raising cigarette taxes by as much of 16 cents a pack, twice the level eventually agreed to in either the plan that emerged from the negotiations or the plans fashioned by the Senate Finance Committee and House Democrats.
Senator Wendell H. Ford, a Kentucky Democrat, and Mr. Rostenkowski, whose committee deals with tobacco taxes, may have had something to do with that.
Mr. Ford is not up for re-election this year, but as one veteran lobbyist explained, ''Kentucky senators have four primary interests in Washington: tobacco, bourbon, coal and horse racing.''
 
Reversal on Airport Fee
As chairman of a Senate subcommittee that oversees aviation, Mr. Ford has until recently been a staunch opponent of legislation that the House has passed that would permit airports to impose fees on passengers as a way of financing construction and improvements.
One city that stands to benefit signifcantly if the fee is finally approved is Chicago, Mr. Rostenkowski's hometown where officials are trying to build a new airport to relieve congestion at O'Hare International. Mr. Ford's subcommittee and the full Senate Commerce Committee recently approved legislation along the lines of the House's measure.
Mr. Rostenkowski insists there was no trade-off. ''The only conversation I've had with Senator Ford is when he came to see me at Andrews and asked me what kind of flexibility there might be on tobacco taxes,'' the Ways and Means Chairman said. Asked whether he had suggested that flexibility on tobacco taxes might be linked to flexibility on the airport fee, Mr. Rostenkowski smiled. ''It's a pregnant thought,'' he said.
 
Favor Liquor Industry
The liquor industry also fared better than it might have, thanks to some persuasion by the Anheuser-Busch Company of St. Louis and help from the House Majority Leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, and the state's two senators in holding down the increase in excise taxes on beer. The California wine industry was another beneficiary of connections in high places.
Although the House Democratic bill would boost wine taxes by 22 cents a bottle, the Senate Finance Committee plan would hold the increase to 18 cents; these taxes would be added to an existing 3 cent tax.
People familiar with the plan said that Republicans on the panel were less concerned about wine than about the campaign of their colleague, Senator Pete Wilson, for governor of California. Mr. Wilson, who is not a member of the Finance Committee, has missed a number of Senate votes in recent weeks so that he could remain on the campaign trail.

HEADLINE: Honoring Investing That Paid

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES

 BODY:
For the last few years George Soros, a Wall Street financier, has quietly bankrolled the democratic movements and leaders who today are struggling to reshape the political landscape of Eastern Europe.
''He recognized early on that to support independent ventures was a critical element in opening up these societies,'' said Michael H. Posner, director of the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, which is to present Mr. Soros with its 1990 Human Rights Award today. ''He helped create an alternative to the state-controlled institutions. He is anti-bureaucratic, aggressive and a risk-taker, and he is not afraid to fail.'' 
Mr. Soros, who is president of Soros Fund Management, and chief investment adviser to Quantum Fund N.V., a $2 billion international investment fund, has distributed more than $15 million this year through nine foundations in Central and Eastern European countries, including his native Hungary.
He has funded Oxford scholarships for Hungarian, Polish and Soviet students along with a trip by free-market Soviet economists to meet officials of the International Monetary Fund in Washington. He bought 400 photocopying machines and put them in Hungarian public libraries and universities at a time when party officials kept such equipment from public use.
 
Now, a More Difficult Task
Dissidents who found themselves dismissed from their jobs were often employed by Mr. Soros for such disparate assignments as translating works by Kant or running a folk-dance troupe.
He gave to experimental schools, independent clubs and research projects, all of which provided shelter to those who organized the groundswell of support that toppled the Communist governments.
''At that time, when our aim was to break open a closed system, we supported the iconoclasts,'' he said. ''Now the task is to build an open system. It is much harder to do this. We no longer support the iconoclasts. Instead of backing opponents to a dam project we try to educate people in ecology. In a way it is much more boring. Building is always more effort than destroying.''
His work has earned him the enmity of many Eastern European nationalists and Marxists, who have accused him of trying to manipulate their economies and societies.
''His work has been positive in that it helped open and enrich our intellectual life,'' said Peter Bihari, a Hungarian Marxist economist who is a visiting professor at the University of Manitoba. ''He provided support to groups that had no other support. But his money has contributed negatively to the change in social forces in Hungary by reinforcing intellectual groups that are against the socialist system.''
 
Trouble with Philanthropists
Mr. Soros has had few failures in the world of international finance, amassing more than $500 million.
''I feel more comfortable with Soviet intellectuals than I do with American businessmen,'' he said one rainy afternoon in the library of his apartment overlooking Central Park.
While Mr. Soros praised the generosity of American philanthropists he said that many fail to channel their money effectively.
''These very level-headed businessmen become very soft, very sentimental when they give money away,'' he said. ''This is partly because they want to have their egos stroked. They don't want to go through the same hard-headed process they engage in when they make money.''
Mr. Soros, who attended the London School of Economics, was influenced by the British philosopher Karl Popper, who argued that Communism and Fascism were philosphically linked and who championed the open, democratic system.
To the young Hungarian, who had suffered through Nazi and Communist rule, the thesis made sense.
 
Biggest Failure Was China
''I am passionately opposed to any kind of closed system,'' he said, ''where there is a dogmatic, fixed interpretation that you are supposed to accept.''
Mr. Soros says his ''biggest and most spectacular failure'' was in China, where he invested several million dollars.
''The foundation itself had become an organ of the security police,'' he said of his abandoned effort in China. ''We lost the battle.'' ''I made a fundamental error,'' he added. ''I thought that I could apply the thinking that I used in Hungary, but the Chinese society has not reached that stage of evolution. Hungary was shaped by the revolution of 1956. The Tiananmen Square massacre was the equivalent of the 1956 Revolution. I misunderstood the historical moment in China.''
Stashed away in Mr. Soro's apartment is an unpublished manuscript he wrote as a young philosophy student who yearned to make a difference in the world of Stalinist labor camps and political show trials and who believed that philosophy could defeat totalitarian dogma.
''I would really like to be recognized as a practical philosopher,'' Mr. Soros said, ''but I am quite happy to be recognized as a philosopher manque.''

HEADLINE: A Tradition for Tampa Raises Questions of Bias

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TAMPA, Fla.

 BODY:
For 86 years, the biggest annual event here has been the Gasparilla parade, a winter extravaganza that features 500 of the city's most powerful men - bankers, lawyers, heads of government agencies -swaggering through the streets dressed up as gun-toting pirates. Mayor Sandy Freedman made the parade part of her pitch to the National Football League for Super Bowl XXV.
But after Tampa was awarded the January 1991 Super Bowl, a racial dispute erupted over the parade, which has always been sponsored and organized by an all white, all male private club. It did not end when the club canceled this year's parade.
The club's top officials refused the demands of a coalition of black residents that the club be integrated immediately. Many black residents, as well as whites, say the existence of the club and its parade shows that, despite some gains for blacks in recent years, the Old South mentality still influences this port city on Florida's gulf coast. 
To its defenders, the parade was a harmless day of celebration for the entire city. To critics, it was a painful throwback to Tampa's segregated past. One critic, a lawyer named Warren Dawson, said: ''It was a bunch of white guys dressed up as pirates, swigging joy-juice and throwing coins, and this time they were going to televise it before the whole world.''
 
Scramble for a Substitute
The club paid for the bash, but the city provided police and cleanup support.
Now the city's Convention and Visitors Bureau and a biracial group of residents are scrambling to put together an integrated substitute parade in time for the Super Bowl.
With about 750 members, the club, Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla, is considered the most prestigious of the many private clubs in Tampa. While membership is secret, local newspaper accounts list among its members H. L. Culbreath Jr., the chairman of the Tampa Electric Company; Hugh Culverhouse, the owner of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and Richard Pittman, the former publisher of The Tampa Tribune.
Walter Baldwin, an insurance executive who is a member of the club and the chairman of the Super Bowl Task Force, said: ''The Krewe is made up of most of the leaders in the community. Unfortunately, it isn't integrated.'' Members say they never set out to make the Krewe all white. Michel Emmanuel, a senior partner of one of Tampa's oldest law firms, and a member of the Krewe, said, ''We've never had a black applicant to consider.''
But Henry Carley, the president of the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said: ''No black man has ever been invited to apply.''
 
Parade Had Some Blacks
Krewe members say they meet as a club only a few times a year. They say the high point is when they dress up as pirates, and sail into town on a 165-foot replica of an old East Indian square rigger, shoot blanks from real guns and swill whiskey from hip flasks.
To a degree, the parade, usually scheduled for February, has become integrated over the years by marching bands from black schools and other floats. But to many people here, black and white, Gasparilla means the spectacle of the pirates, all of them white. ''A bunch of good ole boys having a good time,'' says Bob Gilder, a television talk show host who was the president of the N.A.A.C.P. chapter here for 35 years.
Last August, a coalition of black churches and organizations, including the Greater Tampa Urban League and the N.A.A.C.P., threatened to create bad publicity for Tampa if the Krewe did not integrate and if certain other demands, like more management jobs for blacks, were met.
 
Demand to Admit Blacks
Mr. Dawson, one of the coalition's leaders, demanded that the Krewe admit 25 black members by the end of September. The Krewe responded by calling off the parade.
The captain of the Krewe, Warren Frazier, a lawyer, issued a news release stating that the club's participation might have hurt the city's image. He said that the club would probably integrate soon, but that it was too late to admit new members this year.
But in a letter to club members, Mr. Frazier was more blunt. ''Any compromise which suggested that the Krewe has yielded to pressure would only encourage other special interest groups such as 'NOW', which has stated that it was going to push for women Krewe members,'' he wrote.
Mr. Gilder and others say it is not so much that they want to belong to the Krewe. Rather they want a shot at some of the economic opportunities that they say have been enjoyed by the members of the club.
''This whole town, symbolically, is a Gasparilla Krewe,'' said Mr. Carley, who is the coordinator of minority recruitment for Hillsborough Community College. ''For the most part, Tampa is a closed shop.''
Tampa has 286,000 residents, 23 percent of whom are black. One black sits on the seven-member school board, one on the seven-member County Commission and one on the seven-member City Council. There are only a handful of black executives.
If many of Tampa's blacks chafed over the years at the bit part they were asked to play in the Gasparilla parade, they still considered it a minor annoyance. But all the attention over the Super Bowl this year threw the spotlight on the parade and its sponsors.
It was three years ago that Mayor Freedman sold the N.F.L. on Tampa for the 1991 Super Bowl, set for Jan. 27. ''I thought the parade would set us apart,'' she said recently. ''No Super Bowl had ever had a parade.''
Mr. Baldwin, the chairman of the Super Bowl Task Force, had already persuaded the Krewe to reschedule the parade for the day before the game.
Mrs. Freedman said she had not been aware that the parade might offend blacks. ''I don't think it occurred to anybody,'' she said, adding that the city would not support any future parades unless the Krewe integrates.
 
'I Worked My Way Into It'
Blacks and many whites see no defensible reason for the Krewe's exclusion of blacks. Many Krewe members seem bewildered by the charges of racism.
Mr. Emmanuel, who become a member 35 years ago, said: ''I worked my way into it. I got an application and took it to several of my partners - one of whom was a former governor - who were members. They sponsored me, and after several years I was accepted. I was pleased. It meant you had arrived in the community.''
Along with a lot of other people here, Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Emmanuel say it is time to integrate the Krewe.
''I can think of one or two whom I'd sponsor,'' Mr. Emmanuel said.
Jim Apthorp, a real estate consultant who is the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce and a member of the Krewe, said the issue had raised the consciousness of many people. He has been negotiating with the black coalition over some of its demands.
Prompted by the issue, several other all-white clubs in the city are reported to be about to accept black members.
Henry Carley, who grew up here and remembers when schools and lunch counters were segregated, said he is hopeful. He said the publicity over the Super Bowl and the parade may have given blacks new standing.
''Some people have criticized the N.A.A.C.P. for being opportunistic,'' he said. ''They're doggone right; we are. Everybody else - hotels and restaurants - is being opportunistic about the Super Bowl. I don't see why we shouldn't use it to get more jobs and equal opportunity.''

HEADLINE: Get New York's Fat Out of the Fire

 BODY:
How can New York City's government climb out of the current fiscal mess? By promptly taking two steps: First, keep matters from getting worse by delaying further labor negotiations immediately. And second, find a way to withhold part of the alarmingly large raise granted the teachers' union.
Stop the Clock. Mayor David Dinkins's administration plans to intensify its talks with unions, in an effort to reach settlements this week. That would be a perilous mistake. The city cannot prudently commit itself to further salary increases until the Mayor and his advisers understand more clearly the depth of the city's economic problems. 
Mr. Dinkins's top aides disagree even among themselves on how much tax revenue is coming in, and estimates of the deficit in the coming year vary wildly. Will it be $1.4 billion, as the Mayor's budget office predicts, or $2.6 billion, Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman's even gloomier projection?
Budget-making always requires guesswork, but when the guesses are so profoundly different something is wrong. There has to be a consensus. Until it's reached, there is no plausible way for the city to continue talking with unions. How can Mr. Dinkins and his negotiators say with any confidence what they can afford to pay workers?
Reappraise the Pension Fund Change. Nearly half of the 5.5 percent raise for the teachers' union would come from a change in the union's pension fund. The city says it can save $104 million by investing in higher-income securities, permitting an assumption of 9 percent in earnings, instead of 8.25 percent. That would go toward the raise.
But many pension experts question the prudence of that change. Even supporters of the contract ought by now to be wary of this proposal. That's even truer for those who believe the 5.5 percent settlement is too expensive for the city right now, and would serve as a dangerously costly precedent for settlements with the other unions.
Whether or not the contract negotiations are reopened, however, the city cannot conscientiously proceed with the package until it can solidly justify changing the pension's earning assumptions. Until that's possible, it would make considerable sense to suspend that portion attributed to the change. Without the pension money, the United Federation of Teachers would be left with a 3 percent increase.
The union would do retirees a favor by insisting on further assurances about the pension change. In the meantime, if the U.F.T. will not renegotiate the entire contract, it would perform a major service to the city by agreeing to the more modest 3 percent increase.
But even if the U.F.T. is disposed to cooperate, it can't unless Mr. Dinkins takes bolder action. He is now in a position to show the public and the nervous financial markets that he can manage scarcity. Rolling back, and holding the line, can bring the city back from the errors of the last two weeks.

HEADLINE: ESSAY;
Bring on C.S.C.E.

BYLINE: By William Safire

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Upon hearing that the transcendentalist Margaret Fuller had said ''I accept the Universe,'' the historian Thomas Carlyle delivered this withering put-down: ''By God, she'd better!''
I accept the C.S.C.E. My 18-year battle against the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe is over.
Five weeks from now in Paris, amidst posturing and hoo-hahing at the ministerial level, a new regional agglomeration of nations will be institutionalized.
This will ultimately lead to a vast secretariat - limousines, lifetime sinecures, 24-hour cocktail lounges, the diplomatic works - headquartered in Prague or Budapest, to be wedged between an identity-critical NATO and a cumbrous U.N.
It all began in 1972, the heyday of deceptive detente, when Leonid Brezhnev wanted the West to ratify Soviet claims to the Baltic states and a chunk of prewar Poland. 
His bait: He would agree to our desire for a Mutual and Balanced Forces Reduction negotiation (which President Nixon needed to relieve Senator Mike Mansfield's pressure for withdrawal of our troops) in return for an all-European ''security'' conference that would treat present borders as permanent.
Henry Kissinger went for the deal, leading President Ford to a Helsinki signing in 1975. Because hard-liners in the U.S. grumbled, our side insisted on a ''Basket 3'' in the final agreement calling for human rights in each of the signatories, with a follow-up conference to review progress.
The Soviets got what they wanted - de facto border gains - but had no intention of reducing troop levels (M.B.F.R. talks went nowhere) or of honoring human rights pledges.
We righties went ballistic about this double-cross, demanding that we ''rescind Helsinki'' unless Soviet dissenters were freed. After one such diatribe in this space, a Brezhnevian flack at the Novosti agency in Moscow sent a letter to The New York Times:
''In order to cure the cold Mr. Safire claims to have diagnosed,'' wrote Gennadi Gerasimov, ''he suggests, in fact, removing the head. Just think of the consequences for detente.'' Afghanistan followed.
But the hard-line suggestion that the Helsinki agreement could be rescinded if Moscow ignored it was a useful prod. Equally useful, I now admit, was the cottage industry that grew around the world to monitor the accord. ''Basket 3'' turned out to be a propaganda headache for Mr. Brezhnev.
That was then. Now the handsome Gennadi is peddling perestroika and touting C.S.C.E. With the Warsaw Pact in shambles, his latest boss wants to replace NATO with a European alliance in which Moscow and Washington would have equal influence in a ''Center to Prevent Conflict.''
The new Soviet interest in C.S.C.E. is to break up the military alliance facing Moscow's troops before Soviet disarmament, and to enter the West's economy before accepting capitalism.
No, thanks. Before creating a new regional association to provide shelter for homeless ex-superpowers, we should insist on evidence of deep Soviet arms cuts and thorough economic reform.
Asking too much? Hardly; only when we linked the Soviet-sought Paris C.S.C.E. talks to progress on ending the imbalance of conventional forces in Eastern Europe did Moscow stop stonewalling.
The second round of these arms talks, aimed at halving the new balance of troops and tanks and planes, ought to remain the business of NATO and Moscow, with ''prevention of conflict'' outside C.S.C.E., at least in its formative years.
Our interest in C.S.C.E. should be in forming an organization qualitatively better than the U.N. Its primary purpose should be to advance political freedom and human rights within each of the signatories. Tyranny and torture are not ''internal affairs.'' Sanctions should be built in to prevent the decadelong contempt for Basket 3 that the Brezhnevites displayed.
And let's give the group an accurate name. Drop ''security'' from the title, because it is not a military alliance but an association to promote individual freedom; drop ''Europe,'' too, because this grouping stretches from Vancouver to Vladivostok; and save us from alphabet soup. (Send suggestions to Name That League, The New York Times, 1627 Eye Street, Washington, D.C. 20006.) Henry's Baby has come of age. The new trans-Atlantic community of 37 nations - no deal, of course, unless it includes the three independent Baltic nations - could be a freedom forum and an economic discipline. That's why I accept it. (By God, he'd better!)

HEADLINE: What Kind of People Are We?

BYLINE: By Anthony Shorris: Anthony Shorris was Finance Commissioner for the City of New York in 1989.

 BODY:
The budget deficit facing Mayor David Dinkins has been estimated at between $1.5 and $2.5 billion for next year. While the city's budget appears to be huge - $29 billion in its fiscal year 1992 - in fact, only $20 billion are city funds. The rest are Federal and state monies over which the Mayor has little control.
Of the city's own money, over $2 billion is required to match Federal welfare and Medicaid funds - no comparable burden is placed on any other city in the country - and nearly $3 billion goes to fund debt service on money borrowed long ago. And the Mayor lacks discretion over much of the $15 billion remaining. 
Close to $3 billion is used to pay for the pension of city workers, the costs of the city's leases and fuel bills, and other items essentially outside the Mayor's control. Being $2 billion short on a budget of $12 billion is as a close to a fiscal crisis as the city has been since 1975.
With an undeclared recession melting revenue collections, a crime wave in the daily headlines and a million people living past the brink of poverty, the Mayor's choices - and ours - will not be easy. They are not made easier by those who crab about his rhetoric or second-guess his timing of press conferences. What will the choices we make tell us about what kind of people we have become?
First, we'll find out how smart we are. It doesn't take great ingenuity to raise taxes or cut services. What takes brains and commitment is improving productivity. Commissioners are paid to be effective, and in this crisis every one of them should cut their agency's city-funded, discretionary budget by five percent without reducing services. Otherwise, we should get some new Commissioners.
Furthermore, can we afford to have four separate economic development agencies? Should we continue to spend millions on redundant mini-bureaucracies for elected officials whose powers were reduced by the new charter? Productivity could cut the deficit as much as half a billion dollars.
Union leaders should be asked to improve the efficiency of the government by another one percent. Helping to avoid additional layoffs should stimulate their creativity. When services needs to be reduced by as much as $300 million, we'll find out how much we care about the not-very-safe economic safety net that distinguishes New York from every other city in America.
We can slash programs for the middle classes and the wealthy - subsidizing museums, smoothing roads for those who drive to work, sweeping the streets in midtown - or we can increase class sizes in the early grades, close public health clinics and drop homeless housing programs. We can choose to keep the parks as clean as we would like and tolerate hospital emergency rooms that are Dickensian nightmares.
We can cut back on services to small businesses or we can drop poor children from daycare. We can accept third world infant mortality rates or start collecting garbage in some neighborhoods less frequently.
Economics textbooks tell us that localities should never have progressive tax systems, because wealthier people will vote with their feet and leave only the poor behind. But in New York, we have tried to have a local tax structure that reflects our values as well as our pocketbooks. Now those beliefs will be tested.
When we add the billion dollars of new taxes that the next budget will require, who will pay them? We should return to the 4.3% marginal rate on the city personal income tax that we had only a few years ago, rather that institute new, regressive taxes that give those with unearned income a free ride.
We need to change the property tax system that leaves a city homeowner paying less than half what a Nassau County homeowner pays for a house of equal value. And it's time to use the tax system to discourage behavior we don't like (driving in midtown during the day) rather than behavior we need (poor people taking low-paying jobs to stay off welfare).
The lessons of the last decade should have taught us that for a society to function, sacrifice is required. New Yorkers have long understood this, and as late as the 1970's, municipal labor unions, Wall Street and the government work together to save a city on the brink. Will those same players be able to set aside their parochial interests again?
Can the public employees recognize that wage settlements will directly reduce the level of services for everyone else? After all, the workers of Chrysler and The New York Post took pay cuts to save institutions somewhat less important. In today's crisis, what ''give-backs'' are our labor leaders prepared to offer? Perhaps it's even time to offer some of the able-bodied adults on welfare small additional stipends to perform the work of laid-off civil servants.
Great universities, foundations and private hospitals should pay some taxes, or make ''voluntary contributions,'' toward the services they receive just as Yale now does for New Haven. Museum stores should pay sales tax when they sell the same luxury commodities as other merchants. Members of the city's private clubs would feel less guilty about stepping over the homeless on their doorsteps if they gave up their tax exemption.
The city's insurance companies shouldn't be too proud to start paying the same corporate income taxes as every other business. And is it right that the city should have to spend millions of dollars on tax auditors just to make big businesses pay the taxes they owe? We're waiting to hear more from the leadership of the private sector than threats to dive into the swamps of New Jersey.
Is New York still an assembly of people with a commitment to social justice as well as fiscal prudence? Or has it become, as some have said, a city built on greed and gossip? We will find out whether each of us is to live alone in this great city, or live together as New Yorkers.

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET BATTLE;
White House Urges Decrease In Short-Term Interest Rates

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 14

 BODY:
The White House chief of staff, John H. Sununu, said today that he hoped the Federal Reserve would cut short-term interest rates sharply should an agreement be reached with Congress to reduce the Federal budget deficit.
Mr. Sununu said a short-term rate cut of one-quarter of a percentage point, which has been anonymously suggested by some Federal Reserve officials as the likely reaction to a budget agreement, would not be large enough to affect the slumping national economy. 
''We're hoping for a both short-term and long-term movement in a downward direction,'' Mr. Sununu said. Asked how large the movement should be, he replied, ''That's for the Fed to make the final decision on, of course. But we're hoping for significantly more'' than one-quarter of a percentage point.
Mr. Sununu spoke on the NBC News program ''Meet the Press.''

EXECUTIVES PLAN FOR A RECESSION

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOT SPRINGS, Va., Oct. 13

 BODY:
Corporate leaders at a conference here urged consumers to remain confident in the American economy, while their companies are laying plans to cope with a possible recession.
Many of the chief executives attending the semiannual meeting of the Business Council at the Homestead Hotel said in interviews today and Friday that they were considering cuts in investment spending and, in a few cases, preparing for possible layoffs. As a result of such cutbacks, some industrial equipment companies are already in a recession, their chief executives said. 
New orders at the Cummins Engine Company dropped by a third immediately after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, and have remained low also because of continued uncertainty about the Federal budget. ''Buyers just said, 'I'll stop until I figure out what I need,' '' said Henry B. Schacht, the company's chairman and chief executive.
 
Layoffs Have Started
The Digital Equipment Corporation, the nation's second-largest producer of computers, after the International Business Machines Corporation, has already laid off some employees because of a slowdown in capital equipment sales that began two years ago, said Kenneth H. Olsen, Digital's president and chief executive. Further reductions in employment, possibly through layoffs, are likely, he said.
Robert H. Malott, the chairman and chief executive of the FMC Corporation, a large producer of chemicals and industrial machinery, summarized the position of many chairmen when he said that while his company had made no final decision on whether to cut investment, the combination of the budget impasse in Washington, tensions in the Middle East, higher oil prices and the poor health of the nation's banks was discouraging.
''I have told our people to do their 1991 budgeting and planning as if we were entering a recession, a mild recession, and to be alert in case we're wrong,'' he said. ''The thing that concerns me is that whatever scenario we use, the risk on the downside is greater than the gain on the upside in this environment.''
 
'Oil Price Scenarios'
Senior management at the Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corporation has begun requiring higher projected rates of return for the approval of new projects, said William W. Boeschenstein, who was the company's chairman and chief executive until his retirement two weeks ago.
The General Electric Company is reviewing capital spending for next year, along with staffing, inventory and equipment levels, said John F. Welch Jr., its chairman and chief executive. ''Each business is preparing for a high oil price scenario and a $25 oil price scenario,'' he said.
General Electric has a record level of backlogged orders for products that take a long time to produce, like aircraft engines, electrical power generation systems and medical equipment. But its businesses selling consumer products, including refrigerators and dishwashers, are already in a recession, Mr. Welch said.
Some corporate bosses, like Edwin L. Artzt, the chairman and chief executive of the Procter & Gamble Company, which makes everything from Crest toothpaste to Pampers diapers, said they had no immediate plans to cut long-term investments. Mr. Artzt said his company would be conducting a series of seminars for its managers around the world on how to cope with a recession.
 
Slower Growth Predicted
Motorola Inc., one of the world's largest producers of cellular telephones, two-way radios and other wireless communications equipment, has sharply increased research and development spending in the last several months, resulting in lower than expected third-quarter earnings that sent the company's stock down sharply last Tuesday.

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET BATTLE;
A Familiar Campaign Trail Is Harder to Navigate

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CONCORD, N.C., Oct. 14

 BODY:
In the past two months, Representative William G. Hefner, who has represented this area of small textile towns and farms for eight terms, has been unable to get home to campaign much. The budget debates and standoffs have kept him busy in Washington, so television advertisements stressing his work for farmers, the textile industry and the military have taken the place of personal contact in his re-election campaign.
When he finally returned home this weekend, the Democratic lawmaker ran into a buzz saw of criticism from his Republican opponent, Ted Blanton, who has railed more against the status quo than against Mr. Hefner in particular and pointed repeatedly to the budget impasse in Washington as an example of a hidebound system in which few had the ''courage to take the tough actions.''
Mr. Blanton, a Salisbury lawyer, acknowledged that he was stressing an anti-incumbency message more now than he was before the back-and-forth on the budget. Mr. Blanton said he senses that the voters are receptive, but Mr. Hefner says this notion is more a creation of the news media and Mr. Blanton than a real phenomenon.
The Congressman says he senses that voters have a free-floating anxiety about such things as whether there will be a recession and whether the Persian Gulf crisis will lead to war. They feel frustrated, he said, but not necessarily angry at incumbents. 
 
Frustration at the Fair
At the Cabarrus County Autumn Fest here this weekend, there were indications that both assessments of the voters' mood hold some truth.
Watching his two children romp on a grassy slope to the sound of country music, Bill Caudle said he thought nearly all politicians ''aren't for anything but themselves,'' they ''waffle too much'' and had shown in the recent budget debates that they were not willing to make tough decisions.
''We're frustrated,'' said Mr. Caudle, a salesman with a steel-fabricating company that services military contractors. ''Years of observation tell me that politicians will be for whatever people want. Now, nobody wants higher taxes, but logic tells you that someday we are going to have to pay. I don't have anything against Bill Hefner, but he's a middle-of-the-roader, and sometimes you just have to make waves.''
Seated at a picnic table nearby, Jerry Haire said he was a Republican but still liked Mr. Hefner.
''I don't think there is anything wrong with him, and he hasn't done anything to make me turn against him,'' said Mr. Haire, a draftsman with a textile firm. He said he had been more concerned about Mr. Hefner's attempts last week to override President Bush's veto of a bill limiting textile imports than about the budget debate. Nevertheless, Mr. Haire said, ''I voted for him before, and he's done a good job.''
 
Stress on the Local
Such views are a confirmation of some conventional wisdom to which the 60-year-old Mr. Hefner subscribes. At bottom, all politics is local, he suggested, and the budget contretemps hundreds of miles away in Washington does not matter much to voters back home ''if they are working and aren't sick, and you are performing constituent services.''
But Billy Paul, Mr. Hefner's campaign manager, said the incumbent is not ignoring Mr. Blanton's attempts to ''basically condemn Hefner for being an incumbent.''
Although the Hefner campaign's local polling shows that people are upset with Congress and the President over the budget, Mr. Hefner is making sure voters know that he opposed proposals to cut Medicare and raise excise taxes on such things as gasoline, heating fuel, tobacco and alcoholic beverages. He is stressing that he wants fewer cuts in Medicare and higher taxes for the wealthy.
''And the problem with Blanton is that he isn't proposing anything, just going negative,'' said Mr. Paul.
 
Embraces Farms and Mills
The Eighth Congressional District stretches from the south-central part of the state and its plains of tobacco and wheat farms west and north into the Piedmont, where textile mills are clustered. More than 56,000 people in the district are employed directly in the textile industry, and thousands more depend on it indirectly.
The district skirts the larger urban concentrations of Charlotte at its southern end and Winston-Salem at its northern tip, and is consequently made up of a string of small towns like Concord, Salisbury and Kannapolis, the largest of which has about 32,000 people.
Republican strength has been increasing in the district, but Mr. Hefner has held his own even when strong Republicans like former President Ronald Reagan, President Bush and Senator Jesse Helms have been at the top of the ticket. Two years ago, Mr. Blanton challenged Mr. Hefner and lost in a close race with 49 percent of the vote.
''That was in a Presidential year, when the district went for the Republican Presidential candidate,'' said Howard Schloss, a spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. ''This is basically a rematch, and they can be tricky. But we basically think Blanton showed his best two years ago.''
 
Experience on the Hill
But Mr. Blanton said he believed the ''anti-incumbent'' message sounds better this year than it did two years ago, and that a strong Republican turnout for Senator Helms could be just the margin he needs.
''The thing that comes across to me when I talk to people is that, once politicians get to Washington, they change and become a rubber stamp for the liberal leadership of Congress or for a conservative President,'' said the 40-year-old Mr. Blanton, who from 1977 to 1983 served on the Capitol Hill staffs of a Democratic and two Republican senators. ''I see myself as part of a group of young conservative Republicans in the mold of people like Representative Newt Gingrich, who want to change the status quo and have the courage to do it.''
As Mr. Blanton took his message to people at the Cabarrus County Autumn Fest, there were mixed reactions. Tammy Jordan, a young mother sitting in the tent where children were making balloon dolls, said she agreed that a change was needed and that people like Mr. Hefner had ''lost sight of our needs and been in office too long.''
But seated nearby was Sarah Newberry, who frowned as Mr. Blanton passed through. She said she could not vote for him because he had adopted an anti-abortion stand that was not a strong feature of his last race.
''He's been showing up at these anti-abortion rallies, and I'm pro-choice and will vote that way all the way down the line,'' said Ms. Newberry. ''I don't like the fundamentalist image that we know what's best for you, which a lot of North Carolina politicians are projecting, but I suspect I'm in the minority.''
At 76, Dessie Howell could claim to know more than most about what happens with aging and getting used to something. She is by her own admission set in her ways, preferring to ''live in the country'' rather than move into the city with her grown children. She has voted Republican for a long time but has not talked about it much until recently, and she thinks a change is needed in politics.
Her comments were at once a tonic and a caution for the youthful-looking Mr. Blanton. ''We have to get them old men out of there and get some new ones in,'' she said. ''They get up there in Washington in those jobs for so long, they think they own them. That Jesse Helms has been up there so long he thinks he owns his, but it's time for a change.''

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET BATTLE;
Crux of Tax Debate: Who Pays More?

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 13

 BODY:
As the budget fracas continued last week, often in a cloud of confusion, perhaps the clearest point of contention became the question of who should bear the greatest financial burden of increased taxes: rich or poor or the people in between.
On Thursday, Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee introduced the first plan that would call for a greater sacrifice from the wealthy than from the middle class and the poor. The plan that Congressional and White House negotiators had produced after months of debate had sought just the opposite, taking the proportionately biggest bites from those lowest on the income ladder.
The Democratic proposal to structure tax increases progressively was called unacceptable by President Bush, who is armed with the power of the veto, and the distribution of a final agreement remains anyone's guess. But no matter what happens, the budget debate has brought into sharp prominence the questions of who gets and who gives. 
''The differences in approach are sharpening,'' said Bob Greenstein, director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington group that advocates progressive taxation. ''The middle class is becoming more conscious of how they're being treated compared to the rich.''
 
An Awareness of Inequity
Kevin Phillips, a Republican political analyst and author of a recent book on the distribution of wealth, agreed. ''I think the whole budget debate has slowly but significantly increased the middle class's awareness of what happened in the 1980's, that the people at the top got a real break that other people didn't get,'' he said.
The current debate about distributing burdens comes after a decade in which an often-quoted saying had come true: The rich had gotten richer and the poor poorer. And tax policy was part of the reason.
With the economic expansion of the 1980's, the wealthiest Americans saw their pretax incomes rise sharply while their tax rates dropped. The Reagan Administration argued that tax cuts, by stimulating investment and expanding the economy, would actually bring more revenue to the Government.
According to a study by the Congressional Budget Office, the top 5 percent of American families will have 45 percent more in pretax income in 1990 than they did in 1980, after accounting for inflation. But the overall percentage of that income they pay in major Federal taxes will have fallen from 29.5 percent to 26.7 percent, a drop of almost 10 percent. #28% More by the Poor Precisely the opposite trend occurred on the bottom of the income ladder. The budget office estimates that the poorest 10 percent of American households will earn 9 percent less in 1990 than they did in 1980, in terms adjusted for inflation. But rather than paying 6.7 percent of their income in taxes as they did in 1980, they will pay 8.5 percent, an increase of almost 28 percent.
For the bulk of the middle class, both pretax income and tax rates remained about the same, the budget office figures show.
The main tax change benefiting upper-income households was the cut in income tax rates, from 70 percent in the top bracket in 1980 to 28 percent today. In lowering the rate, Congress closed a number of loopholes that had allowed the wealthiest to reduce what they paid the Government.
The main change hurting the poorest households was the rise in payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare, from 6.13 percent in 1980 to 7.65 percent in 1990. Since the amount of income subject to those taxes is capped, they affect lower-income households more than wealthier families.
 
Paying for Others' Fortune
For those in the middle-income levels, the cut in income taxes and the rise in payroll taxes essentially canceled each other out.
Mr. Greenstein argues that the tax policies of the past decade have sharpened the current debate because tax cuts for the wealthy helped increase the deficit, whose enormity makes the proposed tax increases and service cuts so pressing.
''People in the middle and at the bottom ask: 'Why should I be asked to pay more for the tax cuts wealthy people received in the 1980's?'' he said.
Of the current proposals, the one that would hit lower- and middle-income people hardest is the plan agreed upon by the White House and Congressional leaders but later rejected by the House of Representatives.
Among its features were ones that asked the elderly to pay more for Medicare, delayed unemployment benefits for two weeks and raised the gasoline tax by 10 cents a gallon. A rise in the gas tax hurts the poor and middle-class the most since they spend a greater proportion of their income on gas than do the wealthy.
Perhaps most significantly, the negotiated plan contained no increase in income tax rates.
According to an analysis by the Joint Committee on Taxation, the negotiators' plan would have increased the taxes paid by people with incomes under $10,000 by 7.6 percent, while raising the taxes of people earning more than $200,000 by only 1.7 percent.
Liberal lawmakers denounced the plan as an unfair sop to the rich, and House Democrats began to rally around a plan that reversed the burdens. In the Senate, the Finance Committee crafted a proposal late last week that falls somewhere in the middle.
 
Wealthy as Target
The House Democrats' proposal makes smaller changes in Medicare, leaves unemployment benefits untouched and eliminates the increase in the gas tax.
All those measures are of greatest help to those with modest incomes. So is the Democrats' plan for a larger expansion of the earned income tax credit, a rebate given to working families with children and incomes of less than $20,000 a year.
The House Democrats sought to raise a greater percentage of revenue through higher income taxes on the wealthy. They would do this by raising the top income tax rate to 33 percent, from 28 percent; by raising the alternative minimum tax on those with large itemized deductions to 25 percent from 21 percent, and by adding a 10 percent surtax on those with incomes above $1 million.
The Joint Tax Committee estimated that under the House Democrats' plan the amount of taxes paid by those earning less than $10,000 would fall by 1.3 percent, while those earning $200,000 and above would pay 7.4 percent more.
 
Sharp Differences
The plans are also markedly different in the amount of money they seek to raise from the middle class as opposed to the wealthiest Americans.
For instance, the negotiated agreement sought to raise $20 billion in taxes, but only $3.2 billion of it from those with incomes above $200,000. The Democratic alternative would raise $16 billion, and those earning more than $200,000 would pay almost $10 billion of it.
While the proposal from the budget negotiations would raise $8.6 billion from households with incomes between $30,000 and $75,000, the House Democrats sought only half that amount. While the negotiators' plan would raise taxes of those earning between $30,000 and $40,000 by 2.7 percent, the House Democrats sought only a 1 percent rise.
The negotiated proposal would raise $3.9 billion from households in the $75,000 to $200,000 range, while the Democrats would raise $1.8 billion.
Yet another approach came from the Senate Finance Committee. Its plan would raise fuel taxes almost as much as in the original proposal from the negotiations. Compared with the negotiators' plan, it has a higher limit on deductions for taxpayers earning more than $100,000, but it does not change the basic tax rates as the House plan would.
However the current debate is resolved, analysts see it setting the stage for a longer-term move toward increasing the progressivity of the tax code.
''There's going to be more progressivity, said Mr. Phillips, the political analyst. ''That's out of the barn.''
He said the pressure for change is from people in the middle class, who feel squeezed by 1980's increases in payroll and state and local taxes, and who benefited much less than the rich from Reagan-era cuts in income taxes. Middle-class disaffection, he said, has now found political opportunity.
''In the past 10 days, blood has been drawn, George Bush's blood,'' he said. ''Everything he does gets him headlines about favoring the rich.''

HEADLINE: Outdoors: A Gem in the New Hampshire Rough

BYLINE: By NELSON BRYANT

DATELINE: ENFIELD, N.H.

 BODY:
SOME things don't change and Cole Pond is one of them.
Tucked away in a forested, hill-surrounded valley at an altitude of 1,376 feet, 17-acre Cole Pond is one of the jewels of New Hampshire's remote trout pond system that includes relatively small bodies of water, many of which can only be reached on foot. In some instances, logging roads go to or near them, but such roads are often so boulder-strewn, deeply rutted and muddy that they are almost impassable to an ordinary four-wheel-drive vehicle.
Those who fish Cole Pond face no such problem; there's no road at all, just a foot trail that meanders for less than a mile up the thickly-wooded hillside from Bog Road. (Bog Road runs from Washburn Corner and McDaniels Marsh in Springfield north to Enfield Center, and a large, wooden Fish and Game Department sign marks the trailhead to the pond.) I hadn't visited Cole Pond, which is stocked from a helicopter with about 2,000 fingerling brook trout each spring, for the better part of a decade. The trail was well-worn and in one place there was a fork in it that hadn't existed before. The fork led around a swampy area, but I wallowed through the swamp because that was the route with which I was familiar. Ruth Kirschmeier, my non-fishing companion, chose her own course a little to the south of me. 
A ruffed grouse burst from the edge of the trail when we were a few hundred yards from the pond and a few seconds later another throbbed away unseen.
No one else was at the pond when we emerged from the hemlocks at its south end. Orange, red and yellow leaves torn from the hardwoods by a gusty west wind whirled across the water and dark clouds hurtled past over the hills.
Extricating myself from my pack, I set about inflating my new portable raft on the granite outcropping on the pond's west shore. Only fly fishing is permitted on the pond, and, because the woods grow to the water's edge leaving no room for a backcast, those who would fish it must become waterborne. Decades ago, there were usually one or two battered boats on the pond - often they were dragged in over the snow and left there - but none was visible that day.
Those who visit Cole pond should either portage in a lightweight canoe, or an inflatable raft or wading tube, although there is one spot on the pond's south end where shallow water and a hard sandy bottom permit limited fly fishing with chest waders. Cole Pond is within the state's Enfield Wildlife Management Area, which embraces about 3,000 acres and also includes Butternut and Halfmile ponds and a portion of Smith Pond. Camping is not allowed in the management area.
Ruth took over the raft-inflating task while I assembled my fly rod. The raft, sold by Sherpa of Chicago for $385, appears to be a duplicate of one I once owned that was made by the now-defunct American Safety Company. Including its plastic oars and carrying sack, which doubles as an inflation bag, it weighs only 7 pounds, making it ideal for backpacking anglers. It is billed as a two-person raft capable of supporting 375 pounds. I don't doubt its flotation potential, but unless they are relatively small and unusually supple, a brace of fly fishermen would find it impossibly confining.
The literature that accompanies the raft also says that it can be inflated in six minutes. My best time to date is 20 minutes, if a decent wind is blowing. You need the wind to help you fill the inflation bag with air. For what it's worth, the last stage of inflation making the raft's two flotation compartments drum-tight is more easily accomplished with lung power. I'm not knocking this little raft - I treasure what it does for me - just pointing out its limitations. Finding an angular rock for an anchor, I knotted 50 feet of heavy nylon cord to it and set forth. Cole Pond's deepest point in the middle is more than 50 feet, but I do most of my fishing in 12 to 30 feet along its shores, particularly in fall when the surface water cools and the trout are ranging at all levels. The surface water temperature was 60 degrees that day.
A short while after I began fishing, the patches of blue overhead disappeared and the day grew dark. The temperature dropped more than 10 degrees, into the high 40's, in 15 minutes, and fierce gusts of wind veering back and forth from the west and northwest sent me scudding about the pond with the leaves. A cold, stinging rain began and soon I was kneeling, the only position that I find comfortable in that raft, in a puddle of water. I rowed ashore where Ruth and I took shelter under an overhanging ledge.
A half hour later, the black clouds that had carried the rain swept past, the wind abated and the hills were once again aflame. I rowed to a little cove where more than 25 years ago a huge brook trout had made a pass at my fly, its broad side gleaming in the noon sun as it turned away and left my offering untouched. Ruth ensconced herself on a sun-bathed beaver house on the far shore and got out her sketch pad.
On my first cast - I was using a sinking line and a squirrel tail streamer fly - a fish hit but became unhooked. Two casts later, a medium-sized male brookie was mine. That prompted visions of catching enough trout for supper, but more black clouds swiftly obscured the late afternoon sun and a big wind spun me in a circle about my stone anchor. The day was once again dark and bleak, and the rain resumed.
I drove a cast against the gale toward shore. The fly was taken instantly before it had time to settle more than an inch or two, and I was fast to a good-sized fish, a fat female of about a pound. As I was netting her, the wind spun me in another circle. Damp, cold and cramped but somehow satisfied, I called it quits. Had the day been halcyon, I would have remained until after sundown, using the light of the nearly-full moon to keep me on the trail when I left.
Fifteen minutes later, we set a fast pace downhill in the rain and the wind and the gathering darkness.

How Youth Could Pay A Debt to Civilization

Gratitude
Reflections on What We Owe to Our Country
By William F. Buckley Jr.
169 pages. Random House. $16.95.
Surprise! William F. Buckley Jr. is in favor of national service. In ''Gratitude: Reflections on What We Owe to Our Country,'' America's most articulate conservative thinker proposes a plan for universal voluntary national service for men and women 18 years of age and older. 
Mr. Buckley's program would be overseen by what he calls a national service franchise administration, though it would be financed and shaped on the state level. The young men and women who participate would do everything from caring for children and the elderly to planting gardens and repairing damaged library books. If everyone eligible signed up at a cost, say, of $10,000 each, Mr. Buckley estimates, the total expense would amount to less than ''we were paying for the G.I. Bill after the Second World War,'' and who can estimate what the profit to the country might be?
Why should young people be so obliged? Because, as Mr. Buckley writes: ''Those who do not murder, rape, or steal also owe a debt to their society, if only because it pauses to distinguish between those who rape, murder, and steal and those who do not. Call it, broadly, a debt to civilization; more distinctly, a debt to the 'fatherland' - the nation-state into which we were born, or to which we repaired.'' Mr. Buckley's proposal is surprising because it seems to run counter to everything one thinks of conservatism as standing for. To ask the state to sponsor philanthropy hardly accords with the laissez-faire ideal of a free market in which invisible forces determine supply and demand. It's a little as if Mr. Buckley wanted to wire together President Bush's ''thousand points of light'' and to put switches in every state capital and a fuse box in Washington.
Naturally, Mr. Buckley anticipates conservatives' objections to his program, and liberals' as well. In fact, ''Gratitude'' is organized so as to clear the stage of objections first and then to haul in the rudiments of a service plan.
At the heart of his essay, he argues that a nation can have ''afflictions'' that ''are not registered in conventional demand-supply terms.'' He writes: ''I think that one such affliction is the failure to acknowledge a running debt to one's homeland (biological or adopted). That is one deficiency that national service seeks to accost.''
In sum: a ''great, green pasture exists now outside the formal structures of the market and encourages the desire to augment the effort, in order further to satisfy the needy - but primarily in order to give scope to the impulses of those who desire to go to them. To help.'' In response to Mr. Buckley's proposition, conservatives may argue that when you begin measuring and responding to ''signals'' that do not ''travel from the objective situation to the economist's computer screen,'' you start down a slippery slope that leads toward socialism, and even to the pit of the welfare state.
Meanwhile, liberals may question whether there is really much of a distinction between Mr. Buckley's idea of compulsory service and the sanctions he proposes to make sure that everyone eligible volunteers. The sanctions would range from depriving the reluctant citizen of savings-bank insurance to withholding a driver's license until the young person has signed up for national service.
And both conservatives and liberals may object to the imperative of Mr. Buckley's idea of gratitude. Should everyone to feel thankful simply for the chance of being born? Should a crack baby or anyone likewise disadvantaged at birth feel gratitude to the ''fatherland''? Shouldn't expressions of thanks be reserved to those who have reason to feel spontaneously grateful to the system? Actually, Mr. Buckley is more compelling when he weighs the idea of national service as an effect rather than as an obligation. ''To emulate the Swiss example in the United States would be foolish,'' he writes. ''We do not need a universal military draft. We do need a basket of other services, which could absorb the civic energies, were they proffered, of three-plus million Americans, which energies are otherwise at best dissipated, or worse, channeled into activity hostile to home and to the community - drugs, licentious sex, crime.''
And in addition to diverting young people from negative activities national service might lead them to positive ones. ''I am not conversant with the literature of clinical psychology,'' Mr. Buckley concludes, ''and do not intend to become so. But I sense intuitively that while friendship does not necessarily grow out of experience shared, experience shared conduces to a bond from which friendship can grow. I move on to say that my conviction is that friendship is strengthened by such experiences as bring out in us that which ever so lightly elevates us from the trough of self-concern and self-devotion.''
This vision of friendship rising out of shared experience is the most appealing part of Mr. Buckley's argument. Except, perhaps, for his retelling of Anatole France's story about the young postulant at the monastery alongside Our Lady of the Sorrows whose only skill was juggling. ''And so,'' Mr. Buckley writes, ''in the dead of night, driven by the mandate to serve, walking furtively lest he be seen and mocked by his brothers, he makes his ardent way to the altar with his sackful of wooden mallets and balls, and does his act for Our Lady.''
Mr. Buckley has come forth with a sackful of fresh thoughts, witty anecdotes and philosophical speculations, and he has juggled. The result transfixes the reader's mind and provokes one to imagine ways that the United States might reinvigorate itself.

Disney Adding Book Unit In Bid to Be a Top Publisher

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
The Walt Disney Company plans to establish a unit to publish books for adults as part of a long-term plan to become a leading book publisher.
Disney expanded earlier this year into the children's book field. The latest plan, to be announced formally today, reflects the company's conviction that it can be more profitable than other trade, or general-interest, publishers and that a full range of books will complement its other entertainment businesses. 
''We believe that there are opportunities to be much more profitable in adult publishing than exhibited by other companies up to this point,'' said Charles P. Wickham, group vice president for Disney publishing. He singled out marketing - where Disney's aggressiveness is renowned -as an area in which he believes the company can go well beyond other publishers.
Mr. Wickham declined to say how much the company was investing in the new publishing venture. ''It's a substantial amount,'' he said. ''We're not going in lightly.''
The new adult publishing unit, whose first list will be announced next summer at the American Booksellers Association meeting, plans to publish 50 books in its first year. About 75 percent of those books will be nonfiction.
The division's publisher will be Robert Miller, who was previously vice president of Dell.
No authors have been signed up yet, but Disney plans to sell a complete range of books, from highly commercial to serious.
A name has not yet been chosen for the adult book division, but Mr. Wickham said the name Disney would not be used.
The move into adult books by the Burbank, Calif.-based company follows its decision earlier this year to publish children's books. Its children's imprints include Disney Press, which publishes books based on Disney characters, Muppet Press and a yet-unnamed imprint that will not feature Disney characters.
Mr. Miller said the company intended to market its adult books ''relentlessly.''
Disney, he said, would be looking for new authors whose works could be attractive to ''particular audiences,'' adding that direct marketing, special events and other techniques would be used to push up sales.
Charles E. Hayward, the publisher of Simon & Schuster's trade division, said that although Disney was starting the adult book operation at a time when the economic climate is extremely tough, ''it would be a mistake to underestimate them.''
But he added that the fact the company did not have a mass-market paperback division could be a severe handicap in attracting authors, who increasingly want so-called ''hard-soft'' - or hardback and paperback - deals from publishers.
Disney intends to publish some so-called trade paperback books, but it has no current plans for a mass-market division.
Since Michael D. Eisner took over as chief executive of Disney in 1984, the company's profits have surged. Disney earned $703.3 million last year, a sevenfold increase from 1984, and revenues nearly tripled, to $4.59 billion. These results have been achieved through the aggressive exploitation of existing assets like the theme parks and a bold drive into movies, records and the merchandising of Disney characters.
Stuart Applebaum, a senior vice president at Bantam Doubleday Dell, said that if Disney was half as successful at marketing and selling books as it has been with its theme parks and music, ''it will be a great publishing success.''
But, he added, ''such crossovers do not always work in entertainment conglomerates.''

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Gulf Situation Called Key to Interest Rates

 BODY:
Credit analysts say that despite mounting evidence of a recession, long-term interest rates are likely to remain mired around 9 percent for some time, unless the confrontation in the Middle East is suddenly resolved.
A hint of the kind of tonic a Persian Gulf settlement could be was seen on Friday, when speculation that President Saddam Hussein of Iraq was considering a withdrawal from Kuwait was picked up by credit market participants at the end of a volatile, agitating week.
Bond prices rallied by more than a point on the talk, and the gains were sustained even though the rumors were subsequently debunked.
 
Prospect Tied to Mideast
''It seems clear to me that the crisis in Iraq is holding up rates higher than they otherwise would be,'' said David H. Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International. 
''And if we could get a full percentage point drop in interest rates quickly,'' he added, ''it is conceivable that we could avoid or minimize the damage of a recession. But that prospect hinges on what happens in the Middle East.''
A solution to the crisis in the Middle East would almost certainly give the market more help than an agreement on the Federal budget, analysts said.
 
Different Reactions Expected
''Eventually, probably after the election, Congress will pass a budget that cuts the deficit by $40 billion,'' said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at the Chase Manhattan Bank.
''But given all that has happened in the past few weeks,'' he added, ''I am wondering if the market and the Fed reaction then will be the same as it would have been a week ago. I don't expect a major improvement in long rates for a while.''
News reports said last week that, in early October, members of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee voted to ease monetary policy once a budget package was passed by Congress and signed into law. But since then the policy makers have gotten further evidence that inflation remains a serious problem, including a report last Friday that showed that producer prices rose by 1.6 percentage points in September. As Mr. Fine suggested, those fresh facts are likely to make the Fed less generous than it might have been earlier.
''Larger issues still constrain the Fed,'' Robert V. DiClemente, an economist at Salomon Brothers Inc., wrote in the firm's weekly ''Comments on Credit.'' ''Gathering evidence of recession will set its own timetable for substantive Fed easing,'' he said. ''In the interim, policy makers will likely seek to contain unsettled markets by stalling.''
Aside from inflation worries, long-term interest rates most likely will have to remain high if the Treasury is to sell what likely will be a record amount of securities in the fourth quarter. Particulars of the Treasury's quarterly refunding auctions will not be announced for two weeks.
Still, some market participants are already fearful that with the dollar falling and confidence in the United States shaken, foreign demand for the new Treasury issues will be modest at best, and that interest rates may have to go even higher to sell the new issues.
 
Lack of Participation
Worries about foreign participation received new urgency last week, when the Treasury struggled to sell $8.5 billion of new seven-year notes. The overseas appetite for securities of that maturity has never been strong, but last week, market participants said, it was nonexistent.
Some analysts have argued that the seven-year auction was an aberration. Others said that, even if foreigners did not participate, interest rates were not likely to rise by much, because domestic customers, worried about credit quality and with few alternatives, would take up the slack.
''The seven-year auction took place in an environment of maximum uncertainty on every front,'' Nomura's Mr. Resler said. ''At least some of those issues, most probably the budget, will probably be resolved before the refunding.''
Foreigners may yet balk, but with corporate bond issues off sharply, commercial banks and insurance companies in the United States would seem to have few high-quality alternatives to Treasury securities.
''With the exception of short-term issues, corporate borrowing programs are on hold,'' said Robert A. Schwartz, a vice president and senior financial economist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. With debt levels at near-record levels and the sharp slowdown crimping revenues, ''I think we are in for an extended period of slow borrowing demand'' from the private sector, he added.
''Without a 9 percent coupon on the bond, selling the long-term securities could be hard,'' said William N. Griggs, a managing director at Griggs & Santow Inc., a financial consulting firm. ''But I would think maturities of up to 10 years would not be a problem. The banks and insurance companies, who want to get quality assets, will be big purchasers.''
Aside from observing how much leeway there is in the Friday deadline for Congress to pass a new budget, market participants are likely this week to receive another unwelcome reminder that inflation is at unacceptably high levels. On Thursday the Government is expected to release its September report on consumer prices. Analysts are not sanguine about what the figures will show.
Most forecasters see further increases in prices for gasoline and home heating oil helping to push up the September Consumer Price Index by eight-tenths of a percentage point, a figure that would equal the rise recorded for August. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the index was seen probably rising by three-tenths of a percentage point, following a half-point August rise.

HEADLINE: U.S. Plans Farm Trade Concession

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 14

 BODY:
In an effort to find a compromise with the European Community over the sticky issue of farm subsidies, the United States will present a plan in Geneva on Monday that modifies its call for an end to such aid.
The farm subsidy issue has proved to be a significant barrier to progress in the broader trade talks in Geneva. President Bush has called the talks aimed at liberalizing world trade his highest trade priority, but he has threatened to pull the United States out of the talks if he does not win meaningful cuts in farm subsidies.
 
A Wide Gulf
The latest United States proposal would cut 90 percent of farm export subsidies and 75 percent of farm income supports over 10 years. Washington had previously called for the elimination of all such subsidies over five years. 
Yet the United States' compromises fall far short of what the community has been seeking.
The 12-nation community, which contains a vocal farm bloc five times as large as that in the United States, is promoting an alternative that would trim supports by 30 percent and do little about export subsidies, Washington's main target.
Even with the new American proposal, the gulf is so wide, said Dale E. Hathaway, former United States Under Secretary of Agriculture, that ''only heads of state now can bridge it.''
The United States considers itself the world's most efficient food producer. If farm protection is reduced, it expects to win back export markets lost chiefly to Europe because of historically high European Community subsidies. The Agriculture Department says protectionist policies in other countries cost American farmers $11 billion a year.
 
Delays Broader Accord
''This is the final phase of the negotiations, and we're trying to move the ball forward,'' a senior Administration official said of the new proposal.
Hit by drought and declining prices, European farmers are fighting any significant cuts in the overall level of European Community support. Twice in the last two weeks, protests by French farmers have disrupted ceremonies involving President Francois Mitterrand.
The division over what to slice from the $250 billion a year of worldwide farmer protection programs has checked progress in the broader trade talks, known as the Uruguay Round because the first talks were held in Punta del Este, Uruguay, in 1986. The talks, under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, are scheduled to wind up in two months in Brussels. GATT, the Geneva-based forum that wrote the initial trade charter 43 years ago, serves as the world's trade court.
The success of the talks hinges on complex trade-offs struck by groups of countries. For example, third-world countries are refusing to open their markets to financial services from industrial countries unless those countries make it easier for third-world nations to export food.
The stakes are high. The lower trade barriers that could result from successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round would add $300 billion, or 5 percent, to the gross output of the American economy by the end of this decade, according to a new study by the Stern Group, a trade advisory firm, for a group of multinational companies.
Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, has calculated that the liberalization would raise American exports to third-world countries by $200 billion over the same period.
Washington also sees lower protection as the key to billions of dollars of budget savings.
Under a budget compromise being weighed by Congress, some $13 billion of income support payments would be knocked from the current annual base of $54 billion of farm spending over the next five years.
 
No Unilateral Moves
But the Administration has also said it will not ''unilaterally disarm,'' or cut protection programs, without equivalent reduction abroad.
Still the Bush proposals are making some American farm groups nervous, especially sugar, dairy, peanut and cotton growers, whose quota protection could be dismantled.
Some analysts think the Europeans could be holding back in the belief that Congress will never back the kind of protection cutbacks the Administration seeks.
The European proposal, offered by the community's executive commission but still not finally acted upon by its Council of Ministers, contains provisions that are red flags both to Congress and the Administration.
Washington regards as most objectionable a plan for ''rebalancing,'' under which the community would slap import quotas and tariffs on certain food items on which there has already been international agreement not to increase protection under earlier trade rounds.
The target, most analysts believe, is the $2 billion-a-year market the United States has built up in Europe selling soybeans, oilseed meal and feed grain substitutes. European farmers cannot compete in these markets without special protection. 15 Areas Under Discussion Agriculture is only one of 15 sectors in which negotiators in Geneva are working to put together the overall balance of benefits and concessions that will be necessary for the round to succeed.
Some of the other issues under discussion include strengthening the protection for copyrights and patents, setting up a comprehensive set of market-driven rules to reduce barriers in the service sector and improving GATT's procedures for settling disputes.

HEADLINE: A European Slump Hits U.S. Computer Makers

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
A growing number of American computer companies can no longer count on gaudy sales figures in Europe to compensate for slow growth at home, according to some analysts anxiously awaiting third-quarter earnings figures.
High interest rates and economic stagnation in Britain have been the biggest brake on sales growth. But analysts said uncertainty about where to direct capital investment during Germany's reunification had apparently delayed some computer purchasing in that country, Europe's biggest computer market.
 
A Slump Is Projected
Sales of work stations, personal computers and portables are still growing at a healthy clip. But sales of mainframes are slow, and midsized computers may actually end up showing little or no gain for the year, said Bertrand Lebel, who follows electronics equipment for the International Data Corporation in Paris. And some analysts say that weaknesses are beginning to show up even in parts of the personal computer sector. 
''P.C. growth is down to around 10 percent here from 30 percent last year,'' said Michael A. Styles, who follows the industry for Smith New Court Securities in London.
International Data, a multinational market research firm based in Framingham, Mass., projects that total European computer hardware sales will slump to an annual growth average of 7.9 percent for the five years ending in 1994, from 16 percent in the five years from 1984 to 1989. Donald Bellomy, director of worldwide studies for International Data, said the growth rate for the United States was about 6 percent in the earlier period and was unlikely to change much through 1994.
 
Interpreting the Lag
Analysts say that the economic cycle and political conditions are not the only reasons European sales growth may be flagging. Many companies are preparing to introduce product lines, a situation that encourages customers to delay purchases, said Daniel Benton, a computer industry analyst for Goldman, Sachs & Company.
The trick in interpreting third-quarter figures, analysts say, is to consider these factors after first taking into account the normal sluggishness of the period, which results from the European practice of taking lengthy summer vacations.
A long-term slowdown in sales growth in Europe puts new pressure on growth-hungry American and European computer makers to build up marketing efforts in Asia, despite the difficulty of going head to head with Japanese, Korean and Taiwanese computer makers.
Although Europe will continue to be a bigger market than Japan and is likely to surpass the United States by 1994, demand for nearly every type of computer equipment is projected to be much stronger in the Pacific Rim countries over the next five years, according to International Data.
Analysts said balance sheets would begin to reflect tougher price competition in Europe as well as slower growth for many companies. Among the rumors that worry observers in the City of London, Britain's equivalent of Wall Street, are reports that the International Business Machines Corporation has growing inventories of unsold personal computer products in Britain. ''When the industry leader has problems like that, it is bound to lead to price wars,'' said one analyst, who declined to be named.
An I.B.M. spokesman here said the company would not comment on its inventories in a particular country.
 
Competition from Japan
Price wars for some products might be inevitable even without slower growth. ''If I were an American manufacturer, I would be even more worried about what the Japanese are going to do than the economic cycle,'' Mr. Styles, the Smith New Court analyst, said. He noted that Fujitsu Ltd. would take control of International Computers Ltd., the largest computer maker in Britain, next month, giving it an established distribution and service network to increase sharply its European marketing.
Mitsubishi has acquired the British manufacturing operations of Apricot P.L.C., one of Britain's most successful personal computer companies, and is said to be looking for other expansion opportunities.
''Then there's Hitachi, which has good technology and is second to Fujitsu in Japan,'' Mr. Styles said. ''We haven't heard much from them here, yet.''
Few computer companies break out regional sales figures before the end of their financial year. A few, notably the Unisys Corporation, reported unexpected European sales slumps in the second quarter. Others like Tandem Computer, cited Britain in particular as a weak spot. With earnings due out shortly, no one is commenting on projections for the third quarter.
 
'A Temporary Uncertainty'
The prevailing climate was summed up by Mark Steinkrauss, a spokesman for the Digital Equipment Corporation. ''Outside of Britain, you don't hear talk of a recession, but the overall tone is more conservative,'' Mr. Steinkrauss said. Digital, based in Maynard, Mass., is one of several companies that noticed a slowdown in German investment as reunification approached, but the company sees that development as inconsequential.
''The preoccupation with reunification isn't a negative in terms of computer demand,'' Mr. Steinkrauss said. ''It's just a temporary uncertainty.'' Growth figures are often heavily influenced by where a company is in its product cycle. The Compaq Computer Corporation is riding a heady part of the growth wave for professional personal computers, a market segment expanding than 20 percent annually in Europe.
Compaq figures that 23 percent of the potential European customers for such computers have them already, compared with more than 30 percent in the United States, and that penetration will reach 50 percent in both regions by the end of 1992, according to Gian Carlo Bisone, the Munich-based vice president in charge of European and international marketing for Compaq, which has its headquarters in Houston.

HEADLINE: Expanded Compaq Laptop Expected

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Oct. 14

 BODY:
A year after it began selling small, lightweight ''notebook'' computers, the Compaq Computer Corporation has developed a model that matches the speed and power of the most popular larger desktop machines. Compaq is expected to introduce its machine, named the LTE 386/20, on Monday.
''We are now at the point where this technology allows us to make a notebook computer our primary computer,'' said James D. Poyner, an analyst at William K. Woodruff & Company, a Dallas brokerage. He said the Compaq model and similar versions other companies will soon introduce should make the small laptop sector the hottest field for personal computers in 1991. Fate of the Desktops? The outlook for the industry's overall growth is more dismal, particularly if the nation's economy goes into a downturn. Some analysts said the advent of the notebook machines would depress sales for desktop models with the same features. 
A big appeal of Compaq's new model, Mr. Poyner and other analysts say, is its ability to run a new software program, Windows 3.0 from the Microsoft Corporation, which has become popular for its ability to conduct several tasks simultaneously on the same computer screen.
The Compaq model uses the same electronic brain, the 386 SX microprocessor made by the Intel Corporation, and high-clarity graphics systems as desktop models.
Earlier versions of notebook computers were built around Intel's 286 computer chips. The more powerful 386 chips are twice as fast as the 286 at processing data. Most 286 machines also were hampered by poor graphics clarity.
 
Japanese Disk Drive
Japan's Citizen Watch company is making the three-and-a-half-inch disk drive for Compaq, as it did with Compaq's first notebook model last year. Compaq is also making printed circuit boards with a new technique developed for instrument panels in the military's Stealth aircraft programs. The process eliminated most connectors on the circuit board, saving space and permitting more features.
''This is a new, improved version of an already best-selling product,'' said Peter Rogers, an analyst at Robertson, Stephens & Company, in San Francisco. ''It keeps Compaq in a leadership position, but really doesn't further the state of the art that much.''
The new Compaq machine is 2.2 inches thick, weighs 7.5 pounds and measures 8.5 inches by 11 inches. Its screen can show 25 lines of text at a time. The disk drive in one version stores 60 million characters of information, or approximately 30,000 typewritten pages. A smaller disk drive, which stores up to 30 million characters, is also available.
 
Fast-Growing Segment
Dataquest, a research firm in San Jose, Calif., estimated that 156,000 notebook machines with 386 SX microchips would be sold this year, and 615,000 next year. The segment should be the fastest-growing in personal computers through 1994, said Joan Hoelewinski of Dataquest.
Many analysts said Compaq's initial prices - $6,999 for the high-capacity disk-drive model and $6,499 for the lower capacity machine - were too high and that Compaq would be forced to cut them after several competitors, including Epson, Toshiba, Dell, AST and some smaller companies, begin selling similar models priced as low as $4,000 later this year. Most desktop models using the 386 microprocessor are less than $5,000.
Some analysts said Friday that because Compaq's initial price was too steep, they had reduced their earnings estimates for the company. Compaq's shares lost $2.25 each in trading on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, closing at $36.75, their lowest point in more than a year.
Mr. Rogers, the analyst at Robertson, Stephens, said he was not troubled by Compaq's pricing strategy and did not change his earnings estimate. ''This product will contribute modestly to growth and profitability at Compaq in 1991,'' he said.'' Compaq is now in its third generation of laptop computers; Apple and I.B.M. are not even in the market.''

HEADLINE: NWA Options On Cost Cuts

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ST. PAUL, Oct. 14

 BODY:
The machinists' union at Northwest Airlines said Friday that it was considering a company proposal that it choose between laying off workers or taking a 10 percent pay cut for six months.
Alfred Checchi, the chairman of NWA Inc., the parent company of Northwest, made the proposal on Wednesday to Guy Cook, president of the 24,400-member International Association of Machinists at Northwest, The St. Paul Pioneer Press reported Friday. It quoted unidentified sources.
Mr. Cook generally confirmed the report but said the number of layoffs is ''up in the air.'' He said figures of ''10, 15 and 20 percent were all mentioned.''
Mr. Cook's union covers mechanics, baggage handlers, reservations agents and other ground personnel.
Northwest would not confirm or deny that a proposal was made.
Northwest employs about 44,000 workers, about 16,500 in Minnesota. A 15 percent cut would amount to 6,600 jobs.
Other big airlines, including USAir, Pan American World Airways, Trans World Airlines and the industry heavyweight, American Airlines, have already announced layoffs to cope with a sluggish economy and a 65 percent increase in fuel prices.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL REPORT;
5 Years After Duvalier, Haiti Is Still in Shambles

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti

 BODY:
Like many other people in business here, Richard Morse pegged his hopes on plans for democratic elections in 1987 that were meant to put a definitive end to the long Duvalier family dictatorship.
By reopening the venerable Oloffson Hotel just weeks before the vote, Mr. Morse said he ''figured either we would have a good election and a lot of tourists would start coming, or something bad would happen, and at a minimum we'd have a lot of journalists on our hands.''
Instead, Mr. Morris said, in what could well serve as an epitaph for the entire Haitian economy in the wake of the death-squad attack on voters that forced the cancellation of the elections, ''people got killed, they shot at the journalists and nobody came.''
 
Violence and Corruption
Nearly five years after a popular revolution ended the 29 years of dictatorship by Francois Duvalier and his son Jean-Claude, almost everyone who has managed to remain in business in Haiti has nightmarish tales of hardship. They run from incidents of Government mismanagement and outright thievery to the flight of customers and investors alike in the face of violence, neglect and decay. 
''We have had a succession of Governments without economic plans,'' Raymond Lafontant, president of the Haitian Industrial Association, said of the five regimes, all undemocratic, that the country has seen since 1986. ''That has hurt us as much as any strikes, riots or other social problems.''
Elections are planned for Dec. 16, and Mr. Lafontant and others see them as a sort of last call for the revival of Haiti's once-robust economy. ''If we can't honorably pass the hurdle of true elections, we are going to have a major economic crisis here,'' he said.
By the standards under which most countries measure economic performance, Haiti is the Western Hemisphere's poorest nation and already has a big crisis.
Largely cut off from foreign aid since the 1987 elections, the economy has steadily shrunk. According to official trade data, exports contracted to an estimated $153 million last year, from $223 million in 1985. Imports suffered a similar decline, falling to $259 million last year, from $345 million five years ago,. The Central Bank, in its annual report, has warned of a ''growing pauperization of the Haitian people.''
While neighboring islands and some Central American countries rushed to take advantage of the Caribbean Basin Initiative, a United States regional trade incentive program, Haiti has been left behind.
Much the same has happened in tourism. Once a haven for sophisticates who relished its cultural and historical richness even before many of its neighbors had international hotels, Haiti is now plagued by a lack of investment and a reputation for violence. Even though foreigners have rarely been victims, Haiti has all but disappeared from the tourist map.
Sugar, once a big export, is now imported, and coffee and several other agricultural products are also in steep decline.
 
Elemental Weaknesses
Before they can entertain rosy thoughts of an economic takeoff or even plan for a modest economic turnaround, Haitian businessmen say, much needs to be done to stop the country's steep slide.
Lacking its own oil and having lately had low rainfall, Haiti this year began to experience a severe energy crisis that has included long electrical blackouts and shortages of gasoline. The decrease in rainfall has hampered hydroelectric generation.
The Government recently had to patch together deals with the United States, Venezuela and other countries to assure that a tanker carrying petroleum products arrives every three and a half weeks. In August, when negotiations stalled, the country went virtually without oil for 10 days.
Much of the Government's cash crunch has been attributed by the business community to rampant corruption.
''We don't have smuggling anymore in Haiti, we have direct thievery,'' said George Izmery, a grocery supplies importer. ''All of the goods you see in the country are coming in without paying any taxes. If you go to the provinces, you will see ships unloading cars and refrigerators without passing customs. No wonder the state is going bankrupt.''
Like many in the business community, Mr. Izmery said the Government must mount a serious attack on corruption, while streamlining a host of regulations that discourage trade and investment.
 
Reservoir of Aid
Western diplomats in Port-au-Prince say that should Haiti successfully conduct elections and begin the process of economic reform, there is a large reservoir of international aid already in the pipelines - most of it frozen because of instability and violence - that could quickly become available.
''If you had a more predictable environment here you would quickly see more Haitian and more foreign money legitimately invested,'' said a diplomat who spoke on the condition that he not be identified. ''There is a reasonably large and imaginative private sector here, and given a chance, they would make a go of it.''

HEADLINE: LAWMAKERS OFFER AN ARRAY OF PLANS TO CUT THE DEFICIT

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 15

 BODY:
Filling in details of a comprehensive plan to reduce the Federal budget deficit, Congressional committees recommended cuts today in programs from veterans' benefits to student loans and proposed increases in a wide variety of fees.
But the committees spared food stamps, school lunches and other child nutrition programs. And in defiance of the prevailing trend, House and Senate committees recommended expanding Medicaid to provide health care to more children in poor families.
After a weekend break, budget deliberations resumed on two fronts. One was the committees' work on a budget package intended to save $40 billion in the 1991 fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, and $500 billion over five years. The other was tactical planning by the Congressional leadership. 
 
Democrats to Work Together
Democratic senators, anxious to capitalize on the Republican discomfort over President Bush's proposals on taxes and spending, were promised that their leaders would work with House Democrats to develop a budget plan more favorable to poor and middle-income Americans than what Mr. Bush wants. [Page B8.] The White House has indicated that the President could accept a budget plan similar to the one the Senate leadership has proposed but that he would veto the House plan.
House Republicans, agreeing that any plan of theirs would stand no chance of carrying the House, decided to come forward with a budget plan nevertheless. Their proposal would freeze spending and would not increase taxes at all.
 
House to Vote on 3 Resolutions
The House will vote Tuesday or Wednesday on three budget resolutions: the Democratic leadership plan, a more liberal Democratic alternative and the Republican plan.
While lawmakers on both sides of the Capitol worked on the budget legislation, President Bush was on a two-day campaign swing for Republican candidates. In Dallas, he promised that he would not allow Government spending to continue if authority ran out before a budget was completed.
''Twice now this year, I've signed emergency legislation to add more time to the clock,'' the President said. ''Well, this Friday, time's up. The American people deserve more than this stopgap government.''
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, Democrat of Washington, struck back. ''The President,'' he said, ''often takes the stance of standing aside as if he's not a participant in these budget negotiations.''
Congress is unlikely to finish the budget by Friday night, and Senator Bob Dole of Kansas and Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the leaders of the Republican minority in each house, warned against closing down the Government again.
A veto by the President forced most Government activities to close over the three-day Columbus Day weekend while Congress was working on the broad outline of the budget package. ''I would hope we could avoid that,'' Mr. Michel said. ''I think the President takes a bigger hit than Congress.''
The program reductions proposed today by 22 Congressional committees would curtail spending increases planned for some programs and actually cut spending in others. The House proposals will be folded into an omnibus ''reconciliation bill,'' scheduled for debate by the full chamber as early as Tuesday or Wednesday. The bill would make the detailed statutory changes needed to help save $500 billion over five years, in keeping with the goal endorsed by President Bush and Congressional leaders.
Here are some of the recommendations made by various panels:
Veterans: The House and Senate Committees on Veterans Affairs voted to recommend an increase in the fee for home mortgages made or insured by the Department of Veterans Affairs, and a $2 fee for prescriptions filled for certain outpatients at veterans' hospitals. The panels also called for a one-month delay in the cost-of-living adjustment for compensation payments to disabled veterans, including some wounded in combat. This would save $49 million in 1991, but amounts lost by the delay would be paid in a lump sum at the start of the new fiscal year, in October.
The two committees would also require the Government to try to collect payment from private insurers for health care unrelated to a veteran's military service. The panels estimated that all the proposed changes, taken together, would save the Government $627 million this year and a total of $3.6 billion over five years.
Shipping: In a signal of the lengths Congress is going to raise new revenue, the House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries recommended that tonnage taxes for international cargo shippers, including American carriers when they are coming from foreign ports, be increased for the first time since 1909. The duty for ships coming from ports in the Western Hemisphere would rise from 2 cents a ton to 27 cents; the duty on ships from other foreign ports, now 6 cents a ton, would rise to 81 cents.
Patents: The House and Senate Judiciary Committees recommended a surcharge of about 50 percent on fees paid by people seeking patents. The basic filing fee for a company seeking patent protection of a mechanical or electrical device is now $370. Some small businesses and individual inventors qualify for a discount; Congress rejected a proposal by the Bush Administration to eliminate the discount.
Education: Under a proposal approved by two other Congressional committees, the Federal Government would no longer offer guaranteed loans to students attending certain colleges or trade schools with high default rates. The number of schools that would be affected is uncertain. Congressional aides said the House provisions might affect 1,000 of the 7,000 schools where students receive guaranteed loans, and the Senate provisions could eventually affect 2,000. Most of the schools would be trade schools, which teach subjects like auto repair and truck driving.
Another provision recommended by the two committees would affect freshmen starting work at colleges and trade schools next year. The first disbursement of their guaranteed loans would be delayed until 30 days after classes begun. A significant number of students get loans, drop out of school and then default.
Medicaid: The Senate Finance Committee and the House Committee on Energy and Commerce recommended expansion of Medicaid, the Federal-state health program for low-income people. The House proposal would require states to cover children through the age of 12 in families with income up to the Federal poverty level. The Senate proposal would require coverage of poor children through the age of 18, and it would give states the option of covering children aged 18 and younger in families with income up to 85 percent above the official poverty level.
The poverty level for a family of four was $12,675 last year. If the ceiling were set 85 percent above that level, it would be $23,448.
Banks: The House and Senate Banking Committees voted to allow Federal regulators to increase premiums paid for deposit insurance by banks and savings and loan associations. Commercial banks now pay 12 cents for each $100 of deposits. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation announced last month that the premium for banks would rise in January to 19.5 cents for each $100 of deposits, the largest increase in the agency's history.
The two committees voted to eliminate the statutory limit on premiums. They envision a further increase in the premium for commerical banks, to 23 cents, in January 1992. The increase would help control the Federal deficit and would shore up the bank insurance fund, strained by bank failures.
Worker Safety: Senate and House committees both proposed to increase the civil penalties that can be imposed on employers by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The maximum penalty for a willful or repeated violation, now $10,000, would be increased to $50,000 under the Senate proposal and to $70,000 under the House proposal.
 
Softening the Political Impact
While many proposals in the deficit-reduction package have drawn protests from those affected, they are generally less explosive than earlier proposals to increase health insurance costs for elderly people enrolled in Medicare. Members of Congress say the package is not likely to be approved or defeated because of proposals affecting veterans, college students, banks or shipping companies.
Senator Frank H. Murkowski of Alaska, ranking Republican on the Veterans Affairs Committee, said changes in veterans' benefits accounted for less than 2 percent of all the savings projected over the next five years.
''Congress is attempting to balance the budget uniformly and does not intend for our veterans to shoulder an unfair amount of the burden,'' he said. ''At the same time, veterans' benefits will lose their value if the economy that supports them is crushed under the twin burdens of debt and deficit.''

HEADLINE: Banks Cut Business Lending, Hurting Weakened Economy

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The nation's major banks, concerned about their own deteriorating finances, are making fewer loans to corporations.
By cutting back on loans that companies use to buy other concerns, build factories and develop products, the lending slowdown weakens the national economy and could precipitate or lengthen a recession that many economists say has already begun.
So far this year, according to Federal Reserve data, existing loans to business by the country's large banks have fallen nearly $5.2 billion, to $315.58 billion - a significant change of direction from 1989, when loans at banks rose more than $18.4 billion. Banks have pulled back on lending and laid off employees mainly in response to their own troubles, especially a growing volume of commercial real estate loans that are not being paid back. And Federal regulators have encouraged the banks to be tightfisted by pushing them to set aside more funds as a capital cushion against further losses. 
 
Corporations Are Crimped
Executives and entrepreneurs across the nation are finding that bankers once eager to lend them money are suddenly reluctant. The recent experience of Carl C. Landegger, an investor in several paper mills and owner of the Black Clawson Company of New York City, a profitable manufacturer of paper-moving and recycling equipment, shows how the financial problems at the nation's largest banks are crimping corporate America.
Mr. Landegger, who has in the past arranged billion-dollar loan agreements with banks, was ready to expand again by buying the Garden City Paper Company, a profitable paper recycler in Richmond.
But Mr. Landegger's plans ran into a snag: His bankers, usually so accommodating, balked at financing the acquisition, even though it was the kind of purchase that he says he would have had little trouble getting approved by banks a year ago or so.
''I have never seen banks so afraid as they are now,'' Mr. Landegger said.
In general, bankers' fears, according to analysts, are understandable given the mounting losses on loans at many banks and the continued softening of the nation's economy. Banking regulators have found the industry's losses so worrisome that they are prodding banks to add to their capital, which can be used to cover losses from bad loans. But the industry's troubles are making it increasingly costly for banks to raise new capital because investors are shunning bank stocks and bonds.
''We don't know yet how bad things will become for banks, and that uncertainty is creating a lack of confidence in banks,'' said Richard L. Pike, banking specialist at Chancellor Capital Management, a New York investment advisory firm.
Accordingly, most banks do not have the option to issue new securities to raise capital these days. Thus, to shore up their capital base, the major banks have typically taken two steps to conserve scarce funds: cut their stock dividends and shrink their business.
Twenty banking companies, including the Chase Manhattan Corporation and Chemical Banking Corporation, have reduced or eliminated dividend payments to shareholders in the last year. Many banks are also cutting their work forces, led by Chase Manhattan, which expects to eliminate 5,000 jobs by the end of the year.
Perhaps even more common than dividend cuts is the willingness of banks to reduce assets, the traditional measure of a bank's size and importance. In accounting terms, banks count loans as assets, which can produce profits from fees and interest payments.
 
To Reduce Risk
But by reducing the amount of loans on their books, the banks can also reduce their risks, and reduce their need to borrow money at a time when investors are very skittish. Among the 25 largest banking companies at the end of 1989, nine were smaller at midyear and two showed growth of less than 1 percent. By the end of the year, that trend is expected to expand as bankers reduce their need for outside financing by shrinking in size, either by making fewer loans, or selling the loans they have made.
''Many large banks are now planning for no growth or a shrinking of assets,'' Mr. Pike said. ''This is creating more of a credit crunch than people realize.''
Robert Parry, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said, ''The process of contraction is painful, but I don't know what other choice there is.'' A delay in forcing banks to deal with their problems ''runs the risk of later encountering difficulties in banks that resemble the savings and loan industry,'' he said.
The Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, has told Congress several times this year that he wanted more capital at large banks. By increasing capital, the amount of shareholder funds and long-term borrowings available to absorb future losses, the industry and the Federal deposit insurance program would be better protected from losses, he explained.
 
Capital Plans Needed
Although the Fed has yet to describe in detail its tougher capital standards, bankers and their advisers are preparing. ''If earnings take a hit from loan losses or costs of restructuring, bankers better have a plan to rebuild capital,'' said James McDermott, president of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, a securities firm specializing in banks.
John F. Kooken, vice chairman and chief financial officer at the Security Pacific Corporation of Los Angeles, said that ''to the extent that banks raise capital under these conditions, it adds to their costs, and to the degree that they elect not to raise capital, they will restrict credit flows.''
Both options have important consequences. If banks' costs increase, customers can expect higher fees and interest rates as bankers pass on their costs. If banks curb their lending, more and more companies can expect a cold shoulder from their bank.
Thomas C. Theobald, chairman of the Continental Corporation, a Chicago banking concern, said cutbacks by banks were becoming evident in the corporate loan market. ''Where you might earlier have had six or seven banks competing for a corporation's business,'' he said, ''there might now be only three.''
 
Less Competition
With less competition, Mr. Theobald said bankers had been able to raise fees and interest rates ''a bit, but not enough to get rich.''
In commercial real estate lending, an area where new bank lending commitments have dropped off precipitously after the rapid growth in the last half of the 1980's, Mr. Theobald said that for those banks still willing to lend, there was sometimes so little competition that ''you can now charge just about anything you want.''
Small businesses, which are often the first to be hit when credit becomes less available, report that banks are increasingly reluctant to lend to them. According to the National Federation of Independent Business, only 33 percent of its members said they were borrowing regularly, a record low.
 
Lending by the Fed
So far, the financing problems of large banks have not been serious enough to require emergency loans from the Federal Reserve, except for the Bank of New England, which borrowed several billion from the Fed early this year. But after decades of relying on short-term borrowings, the availability of those borrowed funds is now being questioned.
Christopher Roberts, head of the New York branch of Credit Suisse, one of the world's strongest banks, said, ''We have been benefiting somewhat'' from the problems at American banks. But he added that foreign banks had not been cutting their deposits or credit lines with large American banks.
So far, the four large American banking companies that have less than top-notch financial ratings and rely on short-term deposits from institutions around the world - Citicorp, Chase Manhattan, Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover - have had little trouble in attracting foreign funds.
 
'Clearly Less Confidence
''There is clearly less confidence today in the American banking system than at any time since the Depression,'' said Robin Monroe-Davies, president of IBCA Ltd., a London-based bank analysis firm. ''But there has been nothing at all like the flight of deposits which hit Continental Illinois in 1984.'' After heavy losses from bank oil-industry loans, Continental suffered a run on its deposits and required a multibillion-dollar Federal rescue.
At home, the standing of the largest American banks in the commercial paper market - another important source of short-term financing - has clearly deteriorated. A proposed rule by the Securities and Exchange Commission limiting money market mutual fund holdings of less than top-rated commercial paper to 5 percent of fund assets has hit banking companies hard, since 5 of the 10 largest banking companies do not carry the highest Moody's rating.
''We do not buy any commercial paper that does not carry top ratings of A-1 and P-1, and that means we buy very few bank names,'' said Ellen Harris, manager of the mutual fund group at Paine Webber Inc. ''The higher interest rates on lower-rated issues are not worth the extra risk.''
Paine Webber estimates that large American banking companies have been paying higher rates on commercial paper than top-rated industrial and financial companies, which are also major borrowers in that $500 billion market. While a top-quality company like J. P. Morgan might pay a rate of about 7.90 perent, or 15- to 20-hundredths of a percentage point less than the offered rate for interbank deposits in London, lower-rated companies like Chase, Chemical and Manufactures Hanover would pay 25- to 50-hundredths of a percentage point more than than the London interbank rate.

King Hussein on Kuwait and Dashed Hope

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Oct. 15

 BODY:
He is chain-smoking again, and says it is impossible to sleep more than four hours a night. To relieve the pressure, he has taken to riding around his palace on a BMW motorcycle. While his eyes can sparkle at times, he looks at other times as if he is carrying the cares of 200 million Arabs on his shoulders.
Since the Persian Gulf crisis began, King Hussein of Jordan has traveled more than 50,000 miles and met with 15 leaders to avert a war that he warns would be catastrophic not only for his country, but also for this region and the West.
''With or without war, nothing will return to what it was,'' the King says. ''This will be an area of turmoil unless people face up to the need to create new dreams and new realities.'' 
Now, after 10 weeks, he says that war may be imminent, despite statements in Washington indicating that there are still months of waiting to see if the economic sanctions against President Saddam Hussein of Iraq will work.
If war comes, the Jordanian King says, it will be partly because of a failure by President Bush and other Western leaders to respond in time to signals from the Iraqi leader, soon after the Kuwait invasion, that he was ready to withdraw from most of the occupied territory.
The 54-year-old King, now in his 38th year on the throne, says he believes that a peaceful end to the Kuwait dispute is possible, but only if there is a greater willingness to compromise by the United States and its Arab allies, and what he called ''an end to the current embargo on dialogue.''
''A dialogue across the airwaves is not constructive,'' he said. If diplomacy fails, he said, his conversations with Saddam Hussein have convinced him that the Iraqis would fight.
''If it's a question of humiliation and surrender, it won't work,'' the King said. ''Capitulation is unacceptable.''
Back at Nadwa, his yellow granite palace in downtown Amman, the King continues his diplomatic campaign with King Hassan II of Morocco and President Chadli Benjedid of Algeria, sending letters and messages back and forth between Baghdad and other Arab capitals, planning his next moves.
In a series of interviews over the weekend, he spoke at length about his efforts to prevent and later to contain the Persian Gulf crisis, the first time he has given a full public accounting of his actions.
He said that on Aug. 2, the day of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, he had been given 48 hours by President Bush to secure a commitment from President Hussein to withdraw his troops. The Iraqi leader, he went on, had promised to begin pulling out troops if the Arab League did not condemn him, something it did do. This, he said, led to the collapse of his early efforts.
The King's mood, often frustrated and angry, was lightened by occasional bursts of humor as he mused about happier times, or watched the latest news on CNN. At one point, his spirits darkening, he spoke of resigning from a job that many regard among the most dangerous in the Middle East, thoughts he said he has since put firmly out of his mind.
 
A Favored People Now Out of Favor
Jordan was once regarded by the United States and other Western countries as the most dependable of the Arab nations, Now, King Hussein showed his distress at the way he and his country have been criticized since the start of the crisis by the United States and its allies. They have deplored what they regard as his hedging on condemning the Iraqi invasion, a stand that the harshest critics say comes close to condoning Baghdad's action.
What made his isolation particularly stressful, he says, is that he and President Bush are friends of long standing. And he went out of his way not to assail the United States. He was more critical of his former Arab allies.
Of all Arab leaders, King Hussein said, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt has disappointed him the most. The King said he had helped bring Egypt back into the Arab fold, after its peace treaty with Israel in 1979, but that the move seemed not to have assuaged Egyptian anger at having been excluded in the first place. At a Cairo summit meeting in August, the King said he had the feeling that Mr. Mubarak was ''trying to pay back Iraq for having led the campaign against Egypt.''
Mr. Mubarak has been bitter, in turn, at President Hussein for deceiving him before the invasion of Kuwait, by telling him that he would not take military action.
The King repeatedly emphasized that Jordan has supported all the United Nations Security Council resolutions on Kuwait. He has, however, opposed the presence of American forces in Saudi Arabia, something he said was neither anti-Western nor pro-Iraqi.
''I am pro-peace,'' he declared. ''I have backed nobody except my conscience and the interests of all in peace and security in this region.''
Nevertheless, in the interviews, he praised Mr. Hussein as ''a friend and a new phenomenon in Arab politics.''
When he was asked if he believed that President Hussein, his namesake but no relation, was justified in having invaded part or all of Kuwait, he seemed momentarily uncomfortable.
''I honestly can't tell, but given the leadership of Saddam Hussein, I know it was not easy,'' he replied. ''I can't justify or condone, but the reason must have been pretty substantial to have had it happen. Both sides, I fear, gradually succumbed to a conspiracy theory about the other.''
 
Quashing Rumors Of Lust for Land
The King seemed especially eager to rebut a conspiracy theory that has gained wide credence in Arab circles since the invasion, that Iraq, Jordan and Yemen had been eyeing Kuwait and Saudi Arabia for themselves, and had been planning for months before the invasion to divide up the oil-producing area among themselves.
According to these accounts, Iraq would have taken Kuwait, securing its long-sought free access to the Persian Gulf; Yemen would get part of disputed Saudi territory, and King Hussein, who is revered as a 33d-generation descendant of the prophet Mohammed, would be restored to his family's traditional role as custodian of Islam's most sacred sites in Saudi Arabia.
He said Jordan wanted nothing but peace, and had not been forewarned about the Iraqi invasion.
The King argued, however, that the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait could have been prevented through astute Arab diplomacy, and that American forces would not have been needed if the Arabs had enough time to resolve the problem themselves.
And, he said, the United States' decision to send forces to the Saudi desert was taken before the Riyadh Government formally requested them and, he said, seemed ultimately intended not to defend Saudi Arabia but to destroy President Hussein.
According to the King's account, he received an agreement from President Bush, in a telephone conversation within hours of the Iraqi invasion, that he would be given 48 hours to secure a commitment from Mr. Hussein to withdraw his troops. The King said the commitment was given while he was meeting in Alexandria, Egypt, with Mr. Mubarak.
The King said he told the American and Eygptian leaders that he had talked to President Hussein by phone before flying to Egypt and that the Iraqi had said he was planning to begin withdrawing from Kuwait within days. ''Within a week we'll be gone,'' the King quoted President Hussein as saying. The King told Mr. Bush and Mr. Mubarak that the Iraqi leader had also warned that he ''would not respond positively to threats or intimidation.''
 
Conciliatory Word From Iraqi Quoted
The Arab League foreign ministers were meeting in Cairo, and, the King said, Saddam Hussein suspected that the ministers might call for foreign involvement. ''Let us not scratch each other's eyes out,'' the King quoted the Iraqi leader as saying. ''If things go that way, we may say Kuwait is part of Iraq and annex it.''
Early the next morning, Aug. 3, the King flew to Baghdad, where he found President Hussein ''fine and more relaxed than on my previous visit'' six days earlier. The Iraqi leader, he said, reiterated that he was willing to withdraw from most of Kuwait - exactly to where he did not say - and to discuss other grievances at a meeting of heads of government in Jidda on Sunday, provided the Arab League did not condemn him or call for foreign intervention.
The King said he returned to Amman later that day, confident that agreement was possible, but he said he was unable to get either King Fahd or President Mubarak on the phone. While still waiting to convey the results of the Baghdad meeting, he said, he learned that Egypt had just condemned Iraq's invasion, and that the Arab League was preparing to take similar action that night.
King Hussein said he still did not understand why his initiative was undermined. But the condemnations dashed hopes of an early peaceful resolution to the crisis, he said, adding ''Suddenly, it was all torn apart.''
From the King's version of the crisis, an extraordinary picture emerged of the world of Arab politics - a milieu of secrets and conspiracies; of lies and treachery; of humiliations for him and other, poorer Arabs; of duplicity, revenge and broken promises, and of dashed hopes that, he said, had brought him to consider resignation.
''When you look beyond this,'' he asked, ''what is there for us? I'm proud of what I've done in Jordan, but the region itself is sitting on a time bomb. So before the crisis, I was thinking of quitting. I won't quit in the middle of this. But I'll never be a burden to my country.''
 
When Baghdad Decided to Strike
Ranging back and forth through his experiences in recent weeks, the King shed fresh light on other aspects of the crisis.
Among other things, he said, after the invasion Mr. Hussein had told him that he had decided only late in July that military action was necessary. The King said the Iraqi leader had told him that he had decided to seize all of Kuwait, instead of the part of the territory long in dispute, because he expected the United States to defend the emirate with force, and believed he would be in stronger position militarily and politically if he could eventually withdraw to a point that left Iraq with the disputed territory only.
The King said Saddam Hussein also told him that he never intended to invade Saudi Arabia, a threat that was originally cited by the United States in sending troops there.
Furthermore, the King said, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher had told him, during a meeting at her country residence, that the United States troops were ''halfway to Saudi Arabia'' before they were formally requested. The King said he had confirmed this later through what he described as his own sources.
The King of this small country, flanked on three sides by Iraq, Israel and Saudi Arabia, seemed most agitated when expressing the view that the invasion could have been prevented.
On at least five occasions since the end of the Iran-Iraq war in 1988, he said, he said, he unsuccessfully tried to persuade Kuwait directly or through gulf intermediaries to resolve the financial and territorial disputes with Baghdad that he said triggered the invasion. Saddam Hussein also made repeated, unsuccessful attempts, he said.
He said he first became concerned about an escalation of the dispute five months ago, at the end of May, at an Arab summit meeting in Baghdad.
''We had a closed meeting and he was very frank,'' the King said. President Hussein warned that his debt-ridden country was being strangled by economic warfare waged by ''its brothers'' among Arab leaders, and that these leaders seemed indifferent to the fact that Iraq had protected them and their people with ''the blood of Iraqis'' during the just-concluded war with Iran.
Saddam Hussein had already tried to resolve the border issue during the Iran-Iraq war, the King said. Kuwait and Iraq had formed several different levels of joint commissions to resolve it, but with no success.
 
A Volatile Mixture: Oil and Outrage
The King's ''second jolt'' came when he learned that Iraq's Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, had sent a scathing public memorandum to the Arab League on July 15 accusing Kuwait of violating its oil-production quotas and of stealing Iraqi oil from the Rumaila field, which the two countries shared. Terrible consequences might result, Mr. Aziz warned.
In retrospect, neither Kuwait nor Saudi Arabia seemed to have trusted him, the King said. But he added that relations with Kuwait had never been easy. An assistant to the King described his visits to Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti Emir, for discussions of financial matters, as a ''tin-cup excercise,'' and said that they had become increasingly humiliating.
By 1988, the gulf states had stopped making payments under a 1978 pledge to support Arab countries threatened by Israel. Some had not made full payments. And Jordan had a $6 billion deficit. After 1988, the payments abruptly ended, he said. ''They were putting the squeeze on us and I realized we were going to have severe internal problems,'' the King recalled.
In the spring of 1989, as he had feared, severe food rioting erupted in Jordan. Kuwait ultimately paid Jordan a modest sum, for which the King said he was grateful.
He said his final effort to warn Kuwait about the potential consequences of its deteriorating relationship with Iraq came late in July. On July 29, he visited Mr. Hussein in Baghdad.
''They were bitter,'' the King recalled, speaking of the Iraqis. They recalled with fury, for example, that after Iranian-backed terrorists had tried to assassinate the Emir, ''Iraq had blasted Iran with everything they had - ground to ground missiles, the works.'' Iran had retaliated, causing 1,500 civilian casualties, but Kuwait would not write off its debt, or end the border dispute, or stop stealing oil.
''I realized then that the situation was really very serious,'' the King said. ''I knew they were hurting badly. The atmosphere was tense; the troops were on the border.''
On July 30, the King said he visited the Emir in Kuwait and expressed hope that a special meeting in Jidda between Kuwait and Iraq, scheduled to open the next day, would succeed. And he warned that the meeting was critical.
''I pleaded with them,'' he said. ''They were warm and cordial, unusually so. But there was no commitment, just hopes that it would not fail.''
 
The View of Doom In Soldiers' Eyes
Before boarding his plane, he said, he had a premonition. ''I looked at some Kuwaiti soldiers on the tarmac. I suddenly had a deep sense of sadness. Sometimes, leaders' failures can cost these young people's lives.''
On the plane back to Jordan, the King said his aides told him that they, too, had failed to detect true concern in their meetings with the Kuwaiti Foreign Minister. ''They said their Constitution does not permit us to give up an inch of territory. We won't give in. If they attack us, we would call the Americans.'' The Kuwaitis' only concern, the King said he was told, seemed to be that relying on American military backing would be ''embarrassing'' because of American support for Israel.
He said he had learned of the invasion at 6 A.M. on Aug. 2, when King Fahd telephoned him and urged him to call Saddam Hussein and ask the Iraqi leader to withdraw to the disputed territory. ''It's all Kuwait's fault,'' King Hussein said, quoting King Fahd. ''They would be this adamant. They've brought this about.''
The King said that he spoke to King Fahd rarely after that. On Aug. 6, the Saudi ruler invited ''friendly forces'' to assist in his country's defense. The next day, he sent an envoy to assure King Hussein that relations between Riyadh and Baghdad were fine, that there was no evidence of a hostile Iraqi buildup on the border, and that despite American assertions, there was no truth to reports that Iraq planned to invade Saudi Arabia. Later that night, the presence of U.S. forces in the Saudi desert was announced.

HEADLINE: U.S. AID JUDGMENT UPSETS PAKISTANIS

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Oct. 15

 BODY:
The United States decision to suspend military aid to Pakistan because of strong suspicions that Islamabad is developing nuclear weapons has aroused a debate here that focuses less on this country's arms policies than on the extremely delicate issue of America's supposed ''big brother'' role.
In the last few days, relations with the United States have been dragged into a bitter mudslinging election campaign as Benazir Bhutto's opponents in the Islamic Democratic Alliance accuse the ousted Prime Minister of playing to a Congressional lobby in Washington bent on interfering in Pakistan's internal affairs.
She, in turn, charges her critics with having destroyed a good working relationship with the United States. Crowds at her opponents' rallies shout abuses against the American Congress. Newspaper columnists talk about a ''Zionist conspiracy.'' 
American and other Western diplomats are concerned at the rising level of anti-Americanism, and wonder how self-destructive it might become amid calls to renounce American assistance.
 
Gulf Crisis Costs a Factor
Diplomats and officials of international organizations here say that Pakistan, already suffering severe shocks from the economic costs of the Persian Gulf crisis, cannot afford to resupply its military with new European or other weapons systems, or to antagonize nations on which Islamabad depends for a range of non-military aid.
The nuclear issue exacerbates a still-simmering controversy over remarks the United States Ambassador, Robert Oakley, made to an Asia Society audience in Washington in September. In a speech that dealt only in small part with Pakistan, he voiced a personal opinion that it might be fairer if the standards of government by which a Pakistani court is judging Ms. Bhutto's rule were also applied to the administration that preceded hers. For his remarks, Mr. Oakley was dubbed ''the Viceroy.''
Ms. Bhutto's Government was removed on Aug. 6 amid charges of corruption and she could be banished from political life by the court that is to rule in her case.
In Pakistan, where feelings are quickly hurt when Americans say anything about this country's shortcomings, the suspension of military aid draws outrage that cuts across all regions and classes, reinforcing a range of anti-American constituencies, including Islamic militants.
Aid to Pakistan was suspended, at least temporarily, on Oct. 1 because President Bush was not able to certify to Congress that Pakistan's nuclear program was peaceful, as required by the Symington and Pressler Amendments. The action in Washington means that all military assistance will be cut off while no new economic assistance beyond what is in the pipeline will be forwarded.
 
Criticism Is Impassioned
The criticism of the United States action tends to be impassioned and some is vitriolic, with words like ''imperialism,'' ''blackmail'' and ''exploitation'' being used generously in newspaper columns and letters to editors.
One central theme runs through it all, framed by the question, Why only Pakistan?
''When the United States' interest in Pakistan has been minimal, our nuclear program has proved to be the bugbear,'' a long editorial in the sober, independent newspaper Dawn said in an editorial on Wednedsay. ''This approach especially smacks of cynicism when compared to the tolerance displayed the the U.S. toward other aid-receiving countries such as Israel, India and Brazil.''
All major parties in Pakistan have at one time or another backed a nuclear arms program. Public opinion polls support Islamabad's belief that it has the right to develop a nuclear deterrent so long as India, which detonated a device in 1974, has one.

HEADLINE: SINGAPOREAN CITES SIREN SONG OF TV

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, Oct. 15

 BODY:
On the day that The Asian Wall Street Journal decided to stop circulation in Singapore because of press restrictions, Singapore's Prime Minister, Lee Kuan Yew, blamed television reporting for the deaths near Tiananmen Square in Beijing in June 1989.
Mr. Lee made the remark today in Hong Kong, in a speech to the Commonwealth Press Union, before leaving for China. His trip there will be his first since Singapore normalized relations with Beijing in August.
Mr. Lee said Chinese students had been seduced by television coverage of demonstrations in the Philippines and South Korea into believing that they could alter conditions in China. 
Such coverage, more than any desire for freedom, he said, encouraged Chinese students to protest.
''China's students forgot that China was a very different country from either the Philippines or South Korea, two countries with close links with the United States, where the media and Congress wield immense influence.''
 
Television Is Blamed
Television was responsible for this amnesia, he suggested, saying, ''I believe it is this contextless television experience that led to the tragedy of Tiananmen on June 4.'' On that day, the Chinese Army attacked demonstrators and killed at least several hundred in the streets around the square.
Mr. Lee, who was educated in Britain as well as Singapore, has often spoken of the damage done to Singapore's Asian nature by the individualism of Western values, and often praises his own understanding of Confucianism as a system of communitarian hierarchy and respect.
In a similar fashion, he criticized China's students for not understanding the need for patience and circumspection in their dealings with their aged leaders.
''They had achieved a dialogue with Government leaders,'' he said. ''If they had been patient and circumspect, they could have contributed over 10 years to the gradual opening up of the system, which had already started.''
Mr. Lee, 67 years old, is stepping down as Prime Minister in November after more than 30 years in office. A blunt and combative man, he enjoys annoying journalists and challenging their assumptions about how Asian societies function.
 
Hong Kong Press Criticized
In this vein, he also criticized ''the foreign press'' in Hong Kong, a British colony, for trying ''to foist Western values'' on the citizens there. He said the Western press had ''crusaded for their vision of democracy'' in Hong Kong and had thus caused the Hong Kong stock market to fall after the killings in Beijing.
By the Western press, Mr. Lee seemed to have in mind The Asian Wall Street Journal and its sister publication, The Far Eastern Economic Review, both owned by Dow Jones & Company, which have been regular targets for his criticism and libel suits in Singapore.
The Journal and the Review, whose reporters are not allowed to work in Singapore, are the only regional publications in Asia that try to provide Western standards of objective journalism to the societies there. Mr. Lee has had running battles with both publications since 1987, when he restricted the Journal's circulation in Singapore from 5,000 copies to 400, contending that the paper was interfering in Singapore's internal affairs.
The Journal had published an article about Singapore's plans for its stock market but refused to publish the entire text of a 1,500-word letter the Government wrote in response. Singapore also limited the Review to 400 copies for its reporting on political opposition in Singapore and the treatment of dissidents there. In response, the Review stopped its circulation altogether, causing Singapore to alter its copyright laws to allow a local, advertisement-free reprint of the Review to be sold.
 
Paper Halts Circulation
The Journal fought in the courts to restore its circulation. But after the publication of new regulations on the foreign press, approved by Singapore's Parliament on Aug. 30, the Asian Journal announced in an editorial today that it, too, was halting its circulation in Singapore.
The regulations require foreign publications to post an unspecified security deposit against legal judgments and obtain an annual permit if they distribute more than 300 copies in Singapore and carry articles on politics or current affairs in ''any country in Southeast Asia,'' a requirement that will also apply to the Paris-based International Herald Tribune, partly owned by The New York Times and The Washington Post.
Mr. Lee's announced successor, First Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, has also said that foreign publications may be required in the future to sign a waiver of rights under the Singaporean Constitution in lawsuits, the Journal's editorial said.
''What worries us is the purpose to which, five years of experience warns us, these powers will be put,'' the paper said. The Singaporean Government wants the foreign press ''to practice self-censorship,'' it continued. ''A facade of factual reporting will be allowed,'' it said, but nothing to disturb what the Journal called ''the political monopoly of the People's Action Party or the pretense of democracy.''
Tonight in Hong Kong, Mr. Lee called the Journal's decision unimportant. ''Besides,'' he said, ''anything of importance is immediately faxed to anyone who's got an interest in knowing it.''

HEADLINE: EVOLUTION IN EUROPE: Gorbachev's Prize;
Soviet Leader Is Regarded as a Hero Everywhere but in His Own Country

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Oct. 15

 BODY:
Mikhail S. Gorbachev today became the second Soviet champion of democratic reform to win the Nobel Peace Prize, and the second to be denied a national celebration in this country so often out of step with the world's enthusiasm.
When Andrei D. Sakharov was honored in 1975 for his campaign against Communist suppression of human rights, the private joy of the country's freedom-lovers was muted by an official chorus of vilification. The official press called the prize ''political pornography'' and mocked Dr. Sakharov as a Judas who had sold out to the C.I.A.
Fifteen years later, Mr. Gorbachev's moment was greeted with ambivalence in his Parliament, widespread indifference on the street and bitterness from Mr. Sakharov's widow.
Mr. Gorbachev's compatriots generally acknowledged that his award was justified, but said it would not distract attention from ethnic conflict at home or the indignity of the food markets, where a dozen eggs now cost two days' wages. 
''I am sure that he deserves the Peace Prize,'' said Georgi A. Arbatov, director of the U.S.A. and Canada Institute and a member of Parliament. ''I wouldn't think he has deserved the Nobel Prize for economics.''
 
Revising Economic Plan
Mr. Gorbachev got the news from the Norwegian Ambassador while he was closeted with aides repolishing a much-postponed program to dismantle central economic controls and create a free market. His plan was scheduled for presentation today but was delayed until later in the week as he tried to strike a balance between radical and conservative variants.
The Soviet leader told a pool of television reporters that he was ''thrilled'' by the award and would go to Oslo for the presentation ceremony on Dec. 10, ''like all other recipients'' of the prize. The comment overlooked one notable exception: Dr. Sakharov, who was refused permission to leave the country.
He said the prize reaffirmed the correctness of his policies and would energize him ''intellectually, emotionally and physically.''
Mr. Gorbachev's spokesman said he had not decided what to do with the cash prize of about $710,000 that accompanies the award. In the past he has shared foreign awards and book advances with the Communist Party and domestic charities. #2 Literature Prizes Recalled While the lack of public celebration had its parallel to the award to Dr. Sakharov, it also formed a stark contrast with the way the Soviet Union responded when two of its citizens, Boris Pasternak and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, were awarded Nobel Prizes for literature in 1958 and 1970 respectively. Under pressure and intimidation from the Government, both men turned down their prizes after first accepting, although Mr. Solzhenitsyn eventually was able to pick up his award four years later after he was expelled from his native land.
In the Soviet Parliament, where a hard-line minority spent much of the day savaging the policies that won Mr. Gorbachev the favor of the Nobel Committee, the announcement was greeted with five seconds of lukewarm applause.
During a rare and freewheeling foreign policy debate with Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, critics charged that Mr. Gorbachev had sapped Soviet strength and prestige by his liberation of Eastern Europe and slashing of the military.
''Even I could defend the interests of the Soviet Union in this way, by making concessions, unjustified concessions,'' said Col. Nikolai S. Petrushenko, an army propaganda instructor and a maverick in Parliament.
 
'Award Came From Outside'
Later, in the Kremlin courtyard, Colonel Petrushenko said Mr. Gorbachev's award ''reminds me of the times when Leonid Brezhnev used to pin awards on his own chest.'' He continued: ''My opinion is this will not enhance the authority of the President inside the country. This award came from outside.''
Other deputies praised the award, while agreeing that it would have little impact at home.
Roy A. Medvedev, a historian once persecuted for documenting Stalin's repressions, said Mr. Gorbachev's peacemaking would ultimately help the Soviet economy by cutting military costs and opening the way for Western aid.
Shoppers and sightseers interviewed outside Moscow's two most prominent tourist attractions, Lenin's mausoleum and the new McDonald's restaurant, said the award reflected Mr. Gorbachev's standing in the world, but not his dwindling popularity at home.
 
Suggestion: Buy Big Macs
''The prize is premature, because his work is not finished,'' said Galina Shefkun, a computer programmer. She suggested that Mr. Gorbachev donate the prize money to buy Big Macs for Moscow children.
''The Nobel Committee just doesn't know what it's like here,'' a young teacher told the Reuters news agency. ''Let them spend a couple of months living like Russians and see how they feel. Is peace only for foreigners?''
Some strollers said the Soviet press and television in recent years had recorded so many man-of-the-year awards and peace honors bestowed on Mr. Gorbachev that no one would pay much attention to another.
Few Soviet citizens appreciate the prestige the world associates with the Nobel Prize, perhaps because the Kremlin has traditionally made light of it.
Indeed, a Soviet reporter for the prime-time news program ''Vremya'' asked Mr. Gorbachev how he felt about receiving a prize that has traditionally gone to anti-Communists like Mr. Sakharov and Lech Walesa, the Polish Solidarity leader. The Soviet leader skirted the question.
 
Ill-Timed, Bonner Says
Yelena G. Bonner, Mr. Sakharov's widow and companion in the human rights campaign, declined to comment directly on Mr. Gorbachev's worthiness for the award. But she said it was ill-timed, coming with the world near war in the Persian Gulf and the feckless Soviet leadership fiddling over an economic plan.
''It's shocking, the West's blindness to the tragedies our country has lived through during the five years of perestroika headed by Gorbachev,'' she said in a telephone interview.
Mr. Gorbachev released Mr. Sakharov from internal exile in 1986, and for the next two years the dissident and physicist applauded the Soviet leader while goading him to press farther and faster toward democracy.
But gradually Mr. Sakharov grew disenchanted with Mr. Gorbachev, charging that the Soviet leader was accumulating dictatorial power while losing touch with the public mood. Mr. Gorbachev in turn grew resentful of the pressure from the unrelenting human rights advocate, and today reporters extracted from him only the most cursory praise of his predecessor on the Nobel honor roll.
As Miss Bonner saw it, ''He said what he had to say, nothing more.''

HEADLINE: As Korean Leaders Meet, North Seems Increasingly Isolated

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Tuesday, Oct. 16

 BODY:
Six weeks after the start of a new high-level discussion between North and South Korea, a senior South Korean delegation traveled to the North this morning amid signs that Seoul was prepared to offer some limited new concessions to its longtime Communist enemy.
Prime Ministers Kang Young Hoon of South Korea and Yon Hyong Muk of North Korea are to hold their second round of talks on Wednesday and Thursday in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang. The first set of talks took place Sept. 5 and 6 in Seoul.
Diplomats and officials here said that they did not expect significant breakthroughs and that most likely the two sides would do what they did last time: repeat longstanding positions and demands without significantly narrowing their differences. 
North Korea continues, for example, to demand that South Korea expel the 43,000 American troops deployed there and ban American nuclear weapons from the region as a prerequisite for improving relations. South Korea, rejecting these proposals, wants North Korea to recognize its legitimacy as a government.
Despite the broad differences, officials and specialists said they were not certain what would happen this week, at least in part because of the fast pace of changes since the opening round of talks last month. Some recent developments are seen as possibly forcing the negotiators' hands.
 
Isolation of the North
Perhaps the biggest event was the formal announcement last month by the Soviet Union, North Korea's longtime patron, that it would establish diplomatic relations with South Korea. In addition, China, another Pyongyang patron, has said it will set up a trade office in Seoul.
Both steps illustrated the extent to which the North has become increasingly isolated. It has apparently been forced to look for friends elsewhere in the world; this month it welcomed a delegation from Japan and vowed to improve ties with Tokyo.
Although the Korean changes are not on the scale of what has happened in the last year in Europe, diplomats say they have been startled by the degree of uncertainty spreading in an area that largely remains a relic of cold-war tension and confrontation.
The issue of a United Nations seat for Seoul is a sore point in North Korea, which continues to regard its southern neighbor as an illegitimate colony of the United States. North Korea has been reluctant to agree to anything undercutting its claim to sovereignty over the whole peninsula.
But now both China and the Soviet Union are widely seen as likely to support South Korea's bid for a seat at the United Nations, where it has had to attend as an observer in deference to North Korea's longtime insistence that there be only one seat for the two countries. Neither side now has a seat in the General Assembly.
 
Certain Concessions Seen
In the last round of talks, North Korea made it clear to South Korea that Seoul's persistence in pushing for a United Nations seat for itself could jeopardize the future of the two countries' new dialogue, which is the first effort to reduce tensions on the Korean peninsula in nearly two decades.
According to news accounts in Seoul, President Roh Tae Woo of South Korea is eager to gain some sort of recognition of his Government's legitimacy from this round of talks, which many experts rate as a long shot at best.
Mr. Roh was said to be prepared to make certain concessions, like curtailing joint military exercises with the United States and releasing anti-government dissidents if Pyongyang agrees to improve cultural, family or economic ties between the two countries.
In South Korea, diplomats say they have been a little confused about the signals from North Korea in recent weeks. On the one hand, Kim Il Sung, the 78-year-old dictator in Pyongyang, has been quoted as saying that although there was only one Korean nation, there was room for two governments.
Japanese news accounts of a Tokyo delegation's visit quoted Mr. Kim as saying, ''Let's have one country and one people, but two systems and two self-ruling governments.''
On the other hand, Mr. Kim's son and heir apparent, Kim Jong Il, was quoted in more recent reports as taking a harder line, saying there could be no concessions in such matters, and that Pyongyang would continue to look with disfavor toward a United Nations seat for South Korea.
 
New York Film Festival
Beyond those diplomatic steps, there have been several cultural and athletic exchanges in recent days that appear to have lent an atmosphere of optimism to the talks.
This week, for instance, several South Korean musicians traveled to the North, as did a soccer team. And in New York City the two countries lent their names to a film festival with offerings from both sides. The two sides have also agreed in principle to try to field a joint team at the next Olympic Games.
The delegation from South Korea is expected to pay a call on the elder Mr. Kim in Pyongyang on Thursday, conveying a message from President Roh that sought a summit meeting between the two and for another round of talks at a later date.
Mr. Roh was also said to be ready to accept some of North Korea's choice of language in a joint statement if Pyongyang would make its own concessions. But the South Korean leader has had his own problems in recent weeks, and some diplomats say they have weakened his hand.
The South Korean President was forced to dismiss key military and intelligence aides when it was revealed that military intelligence was continuing to carry out extensive illegal surveillance of South Korean citizens.
Such surveillance is against the law, but North Korea and its left-wing sympathizers have long accused the Government of such behavior. In addition, Mr. Roh is trying to get talks going with Kim Dae Jung, the popular opposition leader.

Cheney Says Forces in Gulf Are 'in for Long Haul'

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Oct. 15

 BODY:
Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney said today after conferring for an hour with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher that the allied forces arrayed against Iraq in the Persian Gulf were ''in for the long haul.''
''I don't think anyone should make the mistake of assuming that this is the kind of operation that will be over in a very short time,'' Mr. Cheney said tonight. He is scheduled to leave on Tuesday morning for a four-day visit to Moscow as the guest of the Soviet Defense Minister, Dmitri T. Yazov.
Asked at a news conference when President Saddam Hussein of Iraq would run out of time for a peaceful withdrawal from Kuwait, which he invaded and seized on Aug. 2, Mr. Cheney said that there was no set timetable. 
 
Discourages Attack Speculation
In brief interviews earlier in the day and before the press at the British Defense Ministry tonight, he sought to play down speculation that the United States and its allies would be forced into a military attack against dug-in Iraqi forces in Kuwait within weeks or months. Last week, the British Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, said that an assessment of how well the current policy of economic sanctions had worked would have to be made within that time.
Tonight, Mr. Cheney said, ''The fact is, we haven't ruled out any options at this point.'' The United Nations sanctions against Iraq are beginning to hurt, he went on, and must be increasing domestic political and economic pressure on President Hussein to withdraw his forces, though he said he could offer no evidence that the Iraqi leader would change his mind.
American forces in and around Saudi Arabia now exceed 200,000, with additional tens of thousands of Arab troops from Egypt and the gulf states. Mr. Cheney told British Independent Television News tonight that the deployed forces had prevented President Hussein from attacking Saudi Arabia after seizing Kuwait.
A British force of about 7,500 troops and 120 tanks from the Seventh Armored Regiment is arriving in Saudi Arabia now, reinforcing several thousand men with British air and naval forces sent to the area in August, and France has deployed an even larger force. Mr. Cheney said he would make a brief visit to Paris at the end of the week on his way back from Moscow.
There, he is expected to discuss the situation in Iraq, where the Soviet Union still has about 180 military advisers, and visit Soviet airborne training centers, Moscow's air defense command, and a MIG-29 aircraft factory.
Asked if he would be pressing the Soviets for more help in persuading President Hussein to leave Kuwait, Mr. Cheney said: ''The Soviets have been, we think, very cooperative to date. I think over all their performance has been consistent with their stated objective of working with the rest of us.''
 
Bush Talks of 'Atrocities'
DALLAS, Oct. 15 (Special to The New York Times) - President Bush accused the Iraqi Army today of committing ''ghastly atrocities'' in occupied Kuwait akin to Hitler's crimes and made an oblique threat to conduct war crimes trials if the United States and its allies succeed in forcing President Saddam Hussein's forces out of Kuwait.
In a speech at a political fund-raiser in Dallas, Mr. Bush said: ''Every day now, new word filters out about the ghastly atrocities perpetrated by Saddam's forces. Eyewitness accounts of the cruel and senseless suffering endured by the people of Kuwait; of a systematic assault on the soul of a nation. Summary executions, routine torture.'' Mr. Bush said the Kuwaiti Emir had told him during a White House visit last month of ''newborn babies thrown out of incubators and the incubators then shipped off to Baghdad.''
''Hitler revisited,'' Mr. Bush said. ''But remember, when Hitler's war ended, there were the Nuremberg trials.''
Mr. Bush did not elaborate.

U.S. Optimistic That Oil Windfall Will Make Iran Honor Embargo

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 15

 BODY:
Bush Administration officials say they are optimistic that Iran, enjoying an economic and diplomatic windfall from the Persian Gulf crisis, will continue to abide by the United Nations embargo on Iraq.
''We don't see any evidence of any significant Iranian violation of the sanctions,'' a State Department official said today. The possibility that Iran might violate the embargo ''is always a concern,'' he said. ''But we have to believe that Iranians know it's in their best interest to help isolate Iraq.'' 
Speaking on condition that they not be identified, American officials say they have no evidence to confirm recent reports from oil industry analysts that Iran might be planning to violate the embargo by swapping food and medical supplies for Iraqi oil.
American officials warn that the Iran's Islamic Government, which has long reveled in its ability to confound conventional wisdom in the West, may yet forge an anti-American alliance with President Saddam Hussein of Iraq designed to foil the blockade.
 
U.S. Heartened by Statements
But the Administration, they say, is heartened by a series of statements from senior Iranian officials, who have vowed that Iran will abide by the United Nations trade sanctions imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran repeated the vow last week, telling Le Monde in an interview that ''if, like Iran, all countires fully applied the embargo, Iraq would be obliged to yield and withdraw from Kuwait.''
The gulf crisis has proved to be a boon for the Iranian economy, which was devastated by the eight-year Iran-Iraq war.
Oil is Iran's major export and, according to some estimates, Iran will take in an extra $3 billion dollars in oil revenues this year because of the jump in oil prices prompted by the invasion. Iran reported this month that its oil exports to Japan, which had once depended largely on Kuwaiti and Iraqi oil, would triple to 750,000 barrels a day.
 
Violation Would End Windfall
The oil bonanza could disappear overnight, however, if Iran breaks its vow and begins trading with Iraq. Under terms of the embargo, a nation that violates the boycott can be subject to a similar boycott.
''Why would Iran want to jeopardize the oil windfall?'' a Bush Administration official asked. ''The Iranians need the money. They are looking for new Western support to rebuild after the war.''
If the Teheran Government violated the embargo, it could also place in jeopardy millions of dollars in development loans that Iran is seeking from foreign lenders, including Western banks.
 
Reassert Regional Power
Foreign policy specialists say recent actions by Iranian leaders suggest that they have come see the gulf crisis as an extraordinary opportunity to wrest concessions from Western nations, as well as from its oil-producing Arab neighbors, and to reassert itself as a regional power.
Shireen T. Hunter, an Iranian specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said she believes that despite the recent peace agreement between Teheran and Baghdad, Iranian leaders have no desire to strengthen President Hussein's position by weakening the embargo.
''It is not in their interest, in the long term or the short term, to see Saddam Hussein emerge as the master of the Persian Gulf and as a hero in the Arab and Moslem world,'' she said. ''You cannot forget that Saddam is the man who devastated Iran during the war, who set Iran back more than 10 years.''
There is general agreement among diplomats and foreign-policy experts that Iran's peacemaking efforts with Iraq since the Kuwait invasion have not been prompted by any newfound support for the Iraqi regime, but instead by a realization that Baghdad was so desperate for Iran's support that it might relinquish much of what it had taken from Iran during the war.

HEADLINE: An Old Refrain, Crime, Sounded In New Contests

SERIES: The 1990 Issues - First article of a series.

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Oct. 12

 BODY:
Early in his standard campaign speech, Clayton Williams, the Republican candidate for governor of Texas, vows to double prison capacity and expand use of the death penalty.
''If you elect me,'' the oil millionaire says in a slow, threatening voice, ''I am going to hurt some drug dealers.''
But moments later he adopts a mellower tone and promotes a package of education programs that he says are intended to keep poor children from turning to crime. He concludes by proposing two years of free college tuition for the disadvantaged.
''About now,'' he adds, ''I bet some of you are thinking I sound like a Democrat.'' Then, changing gears again, he reassures his supporters by asserting that he will pay for his war on drugs by cutting other programs rather than raising taxes. 
 
New Uses for Crime
Across the country this autumn, politicians are developing complex new ways to use crime as a campaign issue. Candidates in several races for governor are blending their positions on crime with stands on other questions, just as Mr. Williams mixes crime, education and fiscal policy into one rhetorical stew.
And crime is being used by a greater variety of candidates to reach a broader swath of the electorate. Republicans emphasized crime most often in the past, and they were usually trying to attract conservative voters, especially working-class Democrats. This year Democrats are just as eager to talk tough, and crime is being used to win over voters across the political spectrum.
The result of all this, according to political scientists and campaign consultants, is a refiguring of some traditional formulas that have distinguished Democrats from Republicans and conservatives from liberals. With voters in a contrary, anti-incumbent mood, they say, many candidates are striving to seem different - to seem anything but a traditional politician - and this is reflected in their use of a classic campaign issue like crime.
''In the past, crime has been more of a character-defining issue,'' said Peter Hart, a veteran Democratic poll taker. ''People dealt with it as a straight up-and-down, stand-alone issue so that a candidate said, 'Here I am on crime, I'm tough, you're not,' and that was it.
''We still see a good bit of that this year, but there is also something a bit different. Some candidates are using more sophisticated tactics by bringing in education and other ancillary issues when they talk about crime.''
 
Talking Tough Not Enough
Talking tough is as popular as ever, but it is not enough this year because virtually all politicians are doing it. Campaign consultants often say they are motivated by the specter of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts floundering in the 1988 Presidential campaign in the middle of accusations that he had treated criminals permissively. Avoiding that fate has meant getting out early with vengeful oratory and anti-crime plans.
''In some ways we are getting a more realistic and mature discussion of crime,'' said Mr. Hart ''It is evolving as an issue.''
Senator Pete Wilson, a Republican running for governor of California, and Gov. Bob Martinez, a Republican who is seeking re-election in Florida, have gone beyond their earlier promises to fight crime to appeal to moderate voters by stressing crime prevention, not just punishment.
Norman Cummings, political director for the Republican National Committee, said, ''A common thread in the gubernatorial races is that crime and quality education go together as issues and one is the key to the other.''
He added, ''Without altering their philosophical framework, Republicans this year are focusing on crime and education to expand their appeal across the political spectrum and to all racial groups.''
 
Campaigning as Outsiders
Among Democrats, Dianne Feinstein in California, John R. Silber in Massachusetts and Lawton Chiles in Florida are running campaigns for governor as outsiders who selectively reject some parts of their party's liberal heritage.
It is perhaps Ms. Feinstein, the former Mayor of San Francisco, who best illustrates the unusual ways that crime can provides the underpinning.
In what campaign consultants have dubbed the ''double death strategy,'' Ms. Feinstein frequently pairs her support for the death penalty with her backing of abortion rights, often highlighting the two disparate points in one brief television commercial.
Facing an electorate that seems to be revolting against traditional political formulas, Ms. Feinstein presents herself as a paradox. Under the slogan ''tough and caring,'' she portrays herself as a maverick who rejects the dogmas of both political parties.
In one of her latest television commercials, Ms. Feinstein promotes a sense of discord between her stand on crime and her lifelong tenure as a Democrat. The advertisement shows her being booed at the state Democratic convention last April when she defiantly told the crowd of predominantly liberal delegates: ''Yes, I support the death penalty. The people of this state want to be protected, and I aim to protect them.''
 
The Essential Counterbalance
For Ms. Feinstein, projecting herself as very tough on crime seems to serve as the essential counterbalance to being a Democrat and a woman. And because she is facing Senator Wilson, who has a long record of promoting anti-crime measures, talking tough is also self-defense.
Dick Dressner, a campaign consultant for Mr. Williams and several other Republicans, said that when it comes to crime, voters respond emotionally. ''They are looking to see if you feel the same way about it as they do,'' he said.
But establishing that link is much more difficult this year. ''There is enormous dissatisfaction out there over the Government's inability to solve problems,'' Mr. Dressner said, ''and the crime problem has been around for so long, it is an obvious target for frustration. The people taking the heat are the incumbents, all over the place, regardless of whether they've been doing a good job or not.''
Democratic officials argue that the public's disenchantment is all the greater because it responded enthusiastically to President Bush's declaration of a war on drugs last year and has been waiting ever since to see a real battle, let alone a tangible victory.
Ms. Feinstein and Mr. Williams, the two candidates who appear to have scored the greatest gains from the crime issue this year, have struck anti-incumbent poses from the outset. And they have addressed crime from the perspective of their own direct experience.
 
An Influential Commercial
Many political experts have argued that a single television commercial played a major role in Ms. Feinstein's come-from-behind victory in the Democratic primary. The advertisement replayed news tape of Ms. Feinstein appearing at a chaotic news conference to announce the City Hall assassinations of Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk. She is widely credited with restoring a sense of civic and emotional order to San Francisco after the 1978 tragedy.
Although Mr. Williams's anti-crime proposals have been criticized for being far more expensive than he acknowledges, he rode from political obscurity to a landslide victory in the Republican primary. He campaigned by telling of his teen-age son's drug addiction and rehabilitation. In virtually every speech, he says that is the reason he entered politics.
Both Ms. Feinstein and Mr. Williams started out with major advantages in the contest to establish emotional links with voters. In the critical early stages of their campaigns they could equate themselves with the public and speak with the outrage of victims. Gradually they have joined their rivals in the classic, and this year much more vulnerable, posture of politicians promising to solve a lingering problem.
Crime has often been considered a Republican issue because virtually every Republican Presidential candidate since Barry Goldwater in 1964 has made it a major element. Many races this year have imitated the slugging match quality of those efforts as candidates strive to prove who is toughest, but in other aspects of style and substance the use of crime this year differs markedly.
There have been relatively few allegations by Democrats this year that crime is being used by Republicans in an appeal to racial bias, compared with recent Presidential campaigns, including 1988. The Bush campaign's heavy use of a commercial featuring a black criminal, Willie Horton, who raped a white woman, generated so much controversy that journalists and campaign officials are on watch for the first signs of racial appeals.
Some candidates, like Mr. Williams, have gone out of their way to avoid this problem. For example, he used all white actors for a chain gang in a commercial that promised to teach drug dealers ''the joys of busting rocks.''
And so far, the candidate facing the loudest charges of racial insensitivity is a Democrat, Mr. Silber in Massachusetts. Among other things, he has explained his reluctance to campaign in a predominantly black area of Boston by saying there was no point in going to ''talk to a bunch of addicts'' about fighting crime.

HEADLINE: Bridging Blight in New Rochelle

 BODY:
Davids Island, a spot of land in New Rochelle Harbor, full of promise for development, may forever remain untouched because of a misguided ruling by Gov. Mario Cuomo's Secretary of State, Gail Shaffer. In objecting to a practical proposal for a 1,750-unit housing development on the island, Ms. Shaffer blights the hope New Rochelle sees in it for reviving its failing economic fortunes.
The plan calls for a causeway and bridge to connect the unused, uninhabited island, once the site of Fort Slocum, to the mainland. New Rochelle's assessor expects the project, designed for 3,100 upper income residents who would need few municipal services, to yield $27 million in property taxes. To support her rejection, Secretary Shaffer cites language in the state's Coastal Management Program urging maximum possible public access to waterfront. But she ignores language in the same document that backs ''large-scale development . . . contiguous to, or in close proximity to an area of concentrated development where infrastructure and public services are adequate.'' 
Few places are more ripe for development than decaying suburban cities like New Rochelle. Such cities once contained thriving industrial, commercial and residential activities. Now they are home to many low-income families but not many job opportunities.
Some of New Rochelle's affluent neighbors oppose the Davids Island plan as a precedent for similar development within their boundaries. But their own zoning laws and cherished independence make that threat remote. These communities also worry about pollution produced by the development. But their concerns should be allayed by state regulations plus developers' commitments to build the necessary sewage treatment facility.
New Rochelle's school board, parents' groups and the local N.A.A.C.P. chapter all have criticized Secretary Shaffer for her negative position. She would serve the state better by balancing her concerns for added beach access with New Rochelle's need to encourage a well-designed, fully taxable housing development.

HEADLINE: Inflation Hits Government and Taxpayer Alike

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Is indexing desirable for tax purposes on ordinary income, on capital gains? The function of taxes is to meet the costs of Government operations. Such costs are affected by inflation to the same degree as income in the private sector. Hence, if taxes are assessed to pay for Government operations, it is essential that they pay the entire amount of such costs, including the portion attributable to inflation.
Since Government costs can't be indexed, not even under the Gramm-Rudman Act, it makes little sense to index the income on which taxes are assessed.

The Commuter's Share

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Commuters and suburban legislators will balk at New York City's proposed payroll tax. The result will be that city residents will again pay a disproportionate share. 
As a White Plains commuter who spends 10 hours every workday in the city and several weekend hours enjoying the culture, arts, entertainment and sports available here, and not in my suburban city, I pay absurdly low taxes. I generate garbage picked up by the New York City Sanitation Department; I am protected by all of the uniformed services in this city and its underfinanced criminal justice system and by the entire network of health services, and I use the city's roads, bridges and subsidized public transportation system.
Considering that I sleep most of the time I am in White Plains, I generate more government expenses in New York City than I do in White Plains. My New York City nonresident income tax rate is a ridiculously low .0045. If I officially resided in New York City, my tax rate would be more than 3 percent of my income.
Now an essential payroll tax is proposed on wages earned in New York City. My commuting neighbors would vote their legislators out of office if they permitted such a tax to be applied to commuters.
Not only should I pay my fair share of a payroll tax, but also I ought to be taxed at a higher rate of my income. Although I am a White Plains resident, for all practical purposes I live in New York City. If commuters paid their fair share, the extra tax base would raise the quality of life in New York City for residents and commuters alike.

Don't Limit Donations

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The budget negotiations between Congress and the Administration include a proposal to limit the deductibility of charitable gifts to increase Federal revenue. The 1986 Tax Act already severely limited the deductibility of charitable gifts by (1) eliminating the deduction for the 72 million taxpayers who do not itemize, (2) making gifts of appreciated property subject to the alternate minimum tax and (3) lowering the tax rates, in effect, raising the cost of giving. 
It has become more and more apparent that charities are going to have to step in to fill the void for services the Federal Government can no longer afford to provide.
The two top Federal tax brackets are 28 percent and 33 percent: this means for a gift of $1, the charity would receive the $1 for use; if it were not donated, the Federal Government would receive only 28 cents or 33 cents. If charities do not receive these funds, additional pressure may well be placed on the Government to provide assistance to programs to make up for the shortfalls that charities now fill.
Changes in the deductibility of charitable gifts will hamper the ability of charitable organizations to provide important services, not only to our local community, but also to those in need of our support throughout the world.

Relief for Singles

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Single people are heavily discriminated against in the Federal income tax system. For example, on adjusted gross income of $35,000 in 1989, a single person taking the standard deduction paid a Federal income tax of $5,954; a childless married couple filing jointly and taking the standard deduction paid $3,866.
For a Federal tax system fairer to single people and less burdensome on lower income people and most middle income people who derive most of their incomes from wages, I suggest the following changes:
* One tax rate schedule, Schedule X, for all taxpayers, except married couples filing separately, for whom a Schedule Y. For Schedule X, five tax rates: 12 percent on taxable income less than $20,000; 15 percent on $20,000 to less than $30,000; 22 percent on $30,000 to less than $40,000; 27 percent on $40,000 to less than $60,000; 33 percent on $60,000 and up. For Schedule Y, halve the incomes at each bracket in Schedule X. 
* Full taxation of capital gains, interest, dividends and other income, from whatever source. Taxation of all Social Security benefits, in the manner of Civil Service annuities and wage income.
* Standard deductions: No change.
* Itemized deductions: None, except charitable cash contributions and medical and dental expenses as currently allowed.
* Exemptions: No change, except an additional $1,000 for oneself if 65 or older, and an additional $1,000 for one's spouse if 65 or older.
* A tax credit for every married couple filing jointly whose income before adjustments is less than $20,000 and a tax credit for every single person and every married person filing separately whose income before adjustments is less than $15,000, the credit being phased in against taxable income so that those at the bottom of the income scale receive the larger credits as a percentage of taxable income.
Even with mortgage interest payments disallowed as a deduction in this tax change proposal, the vast majority of taxpayers making mortgage payments on gross income of $60,000 or less and nearly all taxpayers with gross incomes of $30,000 or less will benefit from the changes.
Taxing all Social Security benefits in full will reduce the after-tax income of many of the elderly. However, there is no compelling reason Social Security recipients should not pay Federal income taxes on the same scale as wage earners making the same income, most of whom are raising families and have fewer net assets than the elderly with the same income.

HEADLINE: Cut the Defense Budget

BYLINE: By William A. Niskanen; William A. Niskanen, chairman of the Cato Institute, was a member of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Reagan Administration.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
At a meeting with some war hawks several weeks ago, one of them told me that ''We owe Saddam Hussein a favor. He saved us from the peace dividend.'' That was no favor. Unless there is a war, the major cost of the risky new venture in the Middle East is the failure to reduce our defense budget in response to the dramatic developments of the past year.
The Soviet empire has collapsed. Soviet troops are scheduled to leave Czechoslovakia and Hungary in a few months and East Germany in a few years. Germany is unified and will substantially reduce its military forces. The outcome of this process is uncertain and may still be dangerous in different ways, but the cold war is over and we won! 
Yet the defense budget included in the revised budget resolution approved last week would spend nearly $300 billion dollars in response to the threats of a world that no longer exist. Indeed, real defense spending for fiscal year 1991 - which specifically excludes all present and future expenditures for the Persian Gulf operation - will be about 10 percent higher than total defense spending at the peak of the Vietnam War.
All of the major weapons programs are continued, and only small reductions are scheduled for the U.S. forces now stationed in Europe and Asia. A failure to make major phased reduction in the defense budget is the primary reason why our political ''leaders,'' for the first time in U.S. history, have agreed to a large tax increase after a major war.
A more responsible post cold war defense budget would reduce real annual defense spending by 50 percent by the end of the decade.
At least three of the four new strategic systems in the current budget should be scrapped: the B-2 bomber, the MX and Midgetman missile system and the new D-5 missile for the Triton submarines.
President Bush has proposed to maintain 195,000 troops in Europe and more than 100,00 in the Far East against a threat that is rapidly disappearing. We should remove and demobilize all of our forces in Europe, Japan, Korea and the Philippines sometime before our good friends ask us to go home.
There is no longer any reason to race to develop an advanced tactical fighter or a space-based missile defense system; on the other hand, we need a good close-support aircraft and some limited defense against strategic missiles. None of these opportunities and problems have been addressed.
There is broad bipartisan support to cut the defense budget. While people may differ on how the peace dividend should be spent, that issue requires both peace and a peace dividend, the prospects for both of which have been threatened in the past several months.
Yet even some of those who most ardently support our new Persian Gulf venture recognize that the current defense budget is not responsive to the new political and military realities. Deep defense cuts can be made, and my own preference is to commit all defense savings to some combination of deficit reduction and, not only no new taxes, but a reduction of those taxes that most limit economic growth.
The reason for my preference in a new reality of our own making - the Federal deficit was about four percent of GNP in the eighth year of economic recovery. The growth of productivity has been slow for 17 years. And the economy is now in a period of negative to slow growth, increasing inflation and falling dollar - at a time when our financial institutions are unusually vulnerable and our ability to borrow abroad has been seriously reduced. Our defense budget should be based on the new economic realities at home.
There is still time for leadership. In a world that has turned upside down in the pursuit of individual freedom and a market economy, an expansive and expensive vision of the American role abroad and of Federal Government at home is neither good economics, good politics nor good sense.

HEADLINE: An Orthodox Synagogue Perseveres in the South Bronx

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
Each Saturday in the Longwood section of the South Bronx, a handful of elderly Jews slowly converges on the Intervale Jewish Center, uncertain whether enough men will gather to worship at the temple to provide a minyan, the quorum of 10 men needed to perform a full service. If not, Moishe Sacks, who serves as the temple's rabbi, will settle for nine and throw open the doors to the wooden ark, where the Torah is stored, and declare that God is their 10th man.
''The ritual says there have to be 10 men, and I don't doubt at all there have to be 10,'' said Mr. Sacks with a sly smile and a shrug. ''The idea is how you count those 10.''
 
Clinging to Traditions
Such creativity has served him well as the rabbi of the South Bronx's only surviving Orthodox Jewish shul, or synagogue. The building's facade looks like a throwback to the decimated temples of postwar Europe, with its doors seeming to be shuttered and a phantom second story that was never completed for lack of funds. 
But Mr. Sacks and his congregation tenaciously cling to their traditions in a neighborhood in which dozens of other temples have faded into memory and Spanish has long since replaced Yiddish as the language of daily life.
While his twists on Jewish law have drawn criticism from his stricter colleagues, Mr. Sacks said his interpretations maintained the spirit of the religious laws and enabled him to continue ministering to his congregation. ''It's like you want to cross the stream and you can use a boat, swim or go across the rocks,'' he said. ''If you can't swim, you use a boat, and if you're a good jumper, you go across the rocks. The important thing is to get to the goal.''
When the Intervale Jewish Center opened in 1922 for Russian immigrants from Minsk, the streets of the South Bronx and the East Bronx were filled with Jews who had traded their dreary existences in Lower East Side tenements for the roomy apartments that sprang up alongside the elevated trains that rumbled up Westchester Avenue. There were stores that catered to their dietary laws, Yiddish theaters that provided popular entertainment, and, above all, temples that met their spiritual needs.
But the 1950's saw the beginning of an exodus from the area to New York City's growing suburbs as Puerto Ricans and blacks moved into the neighborhood, only to find themselves trapped in a shrinking manufacturing economy where jobs were scarce. The neighborhood began its inexorable descent into the depths of urban blight, leaving behind mostly those older Jews either too poor or too set in their ways to move.
To those who remained, the Intervale Jewish Center was the focal point of their lives. ''The synagogue is my heart,'' said Malachi Parkus, 76, who was born in Abyssinia, now Ethiopia. ''Without the synagogue I see no reason to live for.''
 
Faded and Tattered
Where 500 people once fit into the temple, seven worshipers sat last Saturday on creaky benches that were splattered with paint and sometimes served as makeshift shelves for prayer books. Four men went up to the Torah and gently swayed as Mr. Sacks read in Hebrew from the book of Genesis.
Behind them, faded and tattered banners elaborately embroidered with Stars of David or the Ten Commandments flanked by lions and bearing the names of defunct congregations hung on railings in mute testament to the toll that time has taken on the area. The temple's dank, mildewy air has left curlicues of flaking paint clinging to walls mottled with yellow water stains.
Mr. Parkus stood nearby with his head swathed in a tan and black prayer shawl and one hand atop the unrolled scroll. ''I put my hand on the Torah so the words will go up and reach God,'' he explained later. ''That way, every time Mr. Sacks reads, God gets it.''
In the Orthodox tradition, the women sat apart from the men, but not behind the threadbare white curtain that once designated their section along the far left wall. In deference to their age and the temple's tiny congregation, they sat across the aisle from the men at tables, where they awaited their after-service meal of hallah, gefilte fish and dates.
Elsie Miroff, a 92-year-old retired dressmaker, chattered away with two friends, her hoarse, whispery speech a rapid-fire blend of Yiddish and English. Although she closed her nearby tailor shop three years ago to move into a nursing home in the northeast Bronx at her children's urging, she goes to the Intervale Jewish Center every Saturday and Sunday.
 
'It's My People Here'
''I love it,'' she said of the synagogue. ''It's my people here.'' At the end of the service, the men's voices rose in song as they prayed and approached the women. ''As long as my soul is within my body, the Lord is with me and I am not afraid,'' they intoned in Hebrew as the three women at the service rose to their feet and hummed along.
While Saturdays are devoted to worship, Sundays at the temple are a blend of school and socializing. Former and current neighborhood residents, as many as two or three dozen, come by for brunch and a chance to see friends and join a discussion of the week's Torah reading.
''If they want an oasis of Judaism, this is the place to come,'' said Louis Kaplan, 74, a retired clerical worker.
During the week, Mr. Sacks tends to the business of running the temple, paying bills, answering letters from old neighbors who write to see if the temple still exists, and thanking donors who have helped the temple keep it doors open. Occasionally, he engages in biblical discussions with Seventh Day Adventists or Jehovah's Witnesses from down the street who come to him for accurate translations of biblical passages from the original Hebrew.
Mr. Sacks, a pudgy man with silver hair and dark bushy eyebrows who was born in Lithuania, has lived since 1936 in the neighborhood, where he worked in a nearby bakery unitl he retired five years ago.
He arrived at the Intervale temple in 1962 after the other local temples he had attended closed down, one by one. He was never been ordained, but his boundless energy, intellectual curiosity and ability to weave stories that give a lesson made him a natural for the rabbi's position when it was vacated in the mid-1960's.
 
The Driving Force
His congregation credits him as the synagogue's driving force, a view echoed by an anthropologist who chronicled the five years he spent studying the synagoue in ''The Miracle of Intervale Avenue'' (Schocken Books, 1986). ''Moishe gave me a sense of the creative response to the vicissitudes of life,'' said the writer, Jack Kugelmass, who now teaches at the University of Wisconsin. ''He weaves a narrative through which everybody there fulfills a role.''
Although Mr. Sacks's sons have urged him to move from the area because it has been plagued by serious crime and the synagogue has had burglaries in past years, Mr. Sacks remained steadfast in his commitment to the temple. He said he has welcomed to the synagogue the children of mixed-faith marriages who did not feel comfortable in stricter congregations and he has even offered a wedding blessing for a Jewish woman whose own congregation frowned on her marriage to a gentile.
''This shul has got a significance to each person that comes here, whether it is just a tie back to the past, a little soul-searching on the present situation or a little lamentation on how they got into the present situation,'' he said.
 
A Vote of Confidence
Staying open was a vote of confidence in a community that has begun to shed its image of postwar ruin for that of a neighborhood whose sloping streets have started to be lined with renovated apartment buildings and ranch-style houses with green lawns and white picket fences.
''The community itself wages a fight and when they see someone else waging a fight too, it's like gladiators fighting and looking next to them and appreciating one another,'' he said. ''In the end, we have common enemies -enemies against morality.''
The passage of time may have helped the community begin its slow return to stability, but for the temple's elderly congregation, time brings the threat of extinction. Yet on some days, local merchants or the occasional police officer will drop in, filling out the minyan and enabling the group to say the kaddish, or prayers for the dead, while at other times the congregants' grandchildren and great-grandchildren come by for services, giving Mr. Sacks a glimmer of hope that the temple could survive, even if it meant bending the rules at times.
''As long as there is life in you, you can worship God,'' he said. ''Life is the predominant factor.''

HEADLINE: A Weak Economy Buffets Two Commuter Railroads

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
Hit hard by a weakened regional economy, two of the major commuter railroads in the New York metropolitan region find themselves with shrinking tax subsidies, disappointing ridership and rising expenses that could threaten service and lead to higher fares.
The Long Island Rail Road and the Metro-North Commuter Railroad both envision unexpectedly large shortfalls for the fiscal year that begins in January - $27 million for the L.I.R.R. and $20 million for Metro-North. In 1991, the railroads will receive substantially lower tax subsidies, which account for about half of their overall financing, the officials said. The subsidies were cut by the state as a result of its own decline in tax revenue. 
The outlook is worse for the L.I.R.R., which has seen its ridership plummet in the last year, than it is for Metro-North, where ridership is growing but at a much slower pace than in the past. The L.I.R.R. is considering several options, including cutting back service, and closing Penn Station during the early morning hours.
About one-third of 372,000 riders who commute to New York City on the railroads work in industries like finance, banking, insurance and real estatewhere there have been widespread layoffs, the officials said.
At the same time, the costs are increasing, especially as the price of oil rises. Railroad officials estimate that for every dollar increase in the price of a barrel of oil, the railroads pay an additional $500,000 for electrical power.
''We are facing some serious problems here that can only be solved through severe belt-tightening across the board and that may include service reductions,'' said Charles W. Hoppe, who became head of the L.I.R.R. in April.
L.I.R.R. officials said that they now expect $297 million in fare revenues for 1991, compared with their previous estimate of $304 million. The officials expect to receive $311 million in tax subsidies in 1991, compared with the $326 million they had anticipated.
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which supervises the railroads, has told them that they will have to cut their expenses by 3.7 percent in 1991 to offset the expected decline in tax revenues and fares. The railroads already have reduced their expenses by 3 percent this year. A third commuter railroad, N.J. Transit, which is not operated by the M.T.A., has not disclosed its plans for next year.
Mortimer L. Downey, the authority's executive director, said that while the commuter railroads are ''being asked to do more with less,'' he is confident that they will find ways to cut costs without sacrificing the quality of service. But, he said, ''if the economic situation gets worse, the railroads may be forced to make more severe cuts.''
To offset its revenue shortfall, the Long Island is considering continuing its current hiring freeze, reducing the total number of employees through attrition, cutting service on all lines and possibly closing Penn Station for several hours in the early morning.
Although a fare increase is not scheduled until 1992, Mr. Hoppe said that if the economy continues to deteriorate, the price of a ticket could increase sooner.
Ridership on the L.I.R.R. declined 7 percent to 5.6 million passengers in August 1990 from 6.04 million passengers in the same month last year. Railroad officials attribute much of the decline to weak economic conditions, but Sheldon Schachter, chairman of The L.I.R.R. Commuter's Council, an independent watchdog group, said many passengers had abandoned the railroad because of delays and dirty trains.
 
Feeling the Crunch
Metro-North, which serves commuters who live in Connecticut and several New York counties, is in much better fiscal and operating shape than the L.I.R.R.
Average weekday ridership has increased 15 percent to 197,800 passengers this year, compared with 172,500 passengers in 1985. And the railroad's on-time performance reached a record high of 92.6 percent last year, Metro-North officials said.
Still, Metro-North officials said they are feeling the crunch of the region's slow economy and expect ridership to drop considerably by year's end.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 20, 1990, Saturday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about budget problems at the Metro-North Commuter Railroad and the Long Island Rail Road misstated restraints placed on their spending in 1991. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which supervises the railroads, has told them to limit spending increases to 3.7 percent in 1991, not to cut spending by 3.7 percent.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Offers A Plan to Help Small Business

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE

 BODY:
The Dinkins administration yesterday announced a plan to help small businesses, including many owned by women and minorities, get millions of dollars in loans and city contracts.
''We must recreate the old New York where small businesses thrived alongside larger ones,'' Mayor David N. Dinkins said in announcing the plan.
The program would change the city's contracting practices to channel more business to small enterprises, create loan funds to help small businesses grow, and attempt to encourage neighborhood reinvestment and business development. 
The city, facing a budget deficit, will not allocate new funds for the program. Staff members from other economic development programs are being reassigned and $13.5 million will be reallocated from other programs.
Speaking to a crowd of city officials, supporters and minority business owners, the Mayor said the program would particularly benefit companies owned by women and minority-group members, many of which are small, neighborhood-based businesses.
 
Reviewing Past Policies
City officials will also study whether past patterns of discrimination have affected the city's purchasing. If so, the Mayor said, the city will devise programs to set aside some of its business for enterprises owned by women and minority-group members.
City officials emphasized that they had not yet determined whether such a program was needed. They also said any such program would conform to a Supreme Court ruling this year that requires cities to show evidence of past discrimination and to tailor set-aside programs to address specific inequities.
Under the program announced yesterday, four banks - Morgan Guaranty Trust, Banker's Trust, Chase Manhattan and the Bank of New York - will create a $6 million loan fund for small companies. The city will provide $1 million for similar loans.
The city will also award contracts to local businesses whose bids may be as much as 10 percent higher than those by businesses outside the city. City officials said this change would benefit neighborhood businesses and would also keep jobs in New York and increase tax revenues.
In addition, the city will divide larger contracts into several smaller ones to give small companies a better chance to compete.

HEADLINE: New York Municipal Labor Talks Entering Hoped-For Home Stretch

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
New York City's municipal labor talks today enter what both sides hope is the home stretch, in which the negotiators are supposed to go into a room and not emerge until they reach an agreement.
''You lock the doors and don't come out until you have a settlement,'' said Edward Handman, an aide to Stanley Hill, the executive director of District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.
Mayor David N. Dinkins's press secretary, Albert Scardino, described the talks similarly. ''They stay in until white smoke comes up the chimney,'' he said. 
If the negotiators fail to reach an agreement, they can seek a declaration of impasse. Under state law, a panel of neutral arbitrators would be appointed to review the dispute, decide the issues and impose a contract. While the procedure is used occasionally, both sides prefer to work out their differences.
 
A Backdrop of Gloom
For the unions and the administration, this is a bad season to be bargaining, labor experts agree.
The municipal treasury is limited, the region's economy is deteriorating and city revenues are down sharply. Despite recent tax increases and service cuts, projections of the budget gap are growing. In response to rising crime, the administration has announced a costly plan to hire more police.
There is even the specter of 15,000 layoffs to save money. For the unions, the choice between losing jobs and getting raises is distressing. Eric J. Schmertz, the Labor Relations Commissioner, said that ''layoffs are something we'll certainly be tackling in the negotiations.''
The unions are under pressure from their members to keep up with inflation. Specifically, they want to match the 5.5 percent raise and welfare fund increase of $100 per employee that the city granted the teachers on Oct. 1. The city's position is that it cannot offer more than the 1.5 percent raise already budgeted, unless the unions find new savings. The administration is under attack from financial critics who say the teachers' contract was more than the city can afford.
All those pressures mean both sides are searching for creative solutions. The possibilities include productivity savings, maneuvers in pension fund financing like the one that made possible 2.5 percent of the teachers' raise and ways of delaying raises and revising the steps on the pay scales.
Some critics of Mr. Dinkins's labor and fiscal policies oppose what they see as a potentially unwise rush to settlement. ''I fail to see why the Mayor is so anxious to conclude a contract, since it plays directly into the hands of the union leaders,'' said Raymond D. Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a business-supported organization. He said the other unions learned their lesson from the teachers, and ''they want to get their contracts signed before the roof falls in.''
Today's events start with the officers of several city unions gathering for a strategy session at the Sheraton Centre in Manhattan. Mr. Hill, whose 140,000 members constitute the city's largest union, and Barry Feinstein, president of the 12,000-member Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, will be hosts of the breakfast meeting.
About noon the unions plan a joint news conference with city officials. After that, negotiations begin.

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET BATTLE;
Senators Vow to Form Plan Less Favorable to Wealthy

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 15

 BODY:
With their rank-and-file members smelling the political blood of Republicans, Senate Democratic leaders promised at a strategy session today that they would work in negotiations with the House to develop a budget plan more advantageous to the poor and the middle class and less favorable to the wealthy than the one the Bush Administration wants or the one that will go before the Senate this week.
Senators George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, and Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, chairman of the Finance Committee, made that promise at a private lunch meeting of Democratic senators after broad support was expressed for a budget plan to be voted on by the House of Representatives on Tuesday or Wednesday.
That plan, sponsored by Representative Dan Rostenkowski and almost certain to be passed by the House, would force taxpayers earning more than $200,000 a year to bear the brunt of deficit reduction.
A plan approved early Saturday by the Senate Finance Committee would divide the additional tax burden about equally between the wealthy and other taxpayers. This is the plan most likely to be adopted by the Senate and to be sent to a conference with the House to work out the differences. It is in the conference that Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Bentsen said that they would try to make the final legislation more acceptable to the Democratic rank and file. 
 
Another Shutdown Looms
After meeting with President Bush this morning, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, said in an interview that he thought the President would back the Senate plan.
The budget agreement struck last month by President Bush and Congressional leaders would place most of the additional taxes on the middle class and would cut Medicare benefits much more deeply than the other proposals.
With the budget battle heading for a climax late this week, Mr. Bush vowed today to shut down the Government once more if Congress did not produce budget legislation before the authority to spend money lapses at midnight Friday. He was immediately criticized by Thomas S. Foley, the Speaker of the House. Republican leaders also said they thought another Government shutdown would be unwise.
House Republicans, meanwhile, struggling to get off the political defensive, prepared a budget plan that would contain no tax increases whatsoever.
 
Senators' Churning Stomachs
Senators Mitchell and Bentsen were clearly uncomfortable at the luncheon meeting today, said senators who were present. The leaders argued that they were compelled to support a budget package less politically attractive than the House bill because they needed bipartisan support to get any legislation through the Senate.
No one at the lunch stood to support Senators Mitchell and Bentsen, but their predicament was widely understood, senators said.
''If anybody's stomach is turning upside down over not being able to support Rostenkowski, it's George Mitchell, but he's in a very tough spot,'' one Democratic senator said.
Senator Bentsen said after the lunch that he had not defended his committee's bill so much as he had explained that it was the best bill that could realistically get through the Senate.
''I told them,'' he said, speaking of his colleagues, ''that the American people are fed up with arguing, and they want this thing to be brought to a successful conclusion. This means you have to have bipartisan support.''
 
Rostenkowski Plan Favored
But Democrats coming out of the lunch said they felt they were on the political offensive for the first time in years. Mr. Rostenkowski's plan, they said, allowed Democrats to be seen as the party of the people and Republicans as the party of fat cats.
Several senators said they expected someone to offer the Rostenkowski proposal as an amendment on the Senate floor but that it would surely be voted down because of solid Republican opposition and because of a Senate rule that would require it to obtain 60 votes for approval. There are 55 Democrats in the Senate.
''The whole question becomes what do you do to the hand in conference,'' said Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota.
After bills are passed by the Senate and House, they go to a conference committee for reconciliation of the differences. For approval in the conference, a measure must have the votes of a majority of the House conferees and a majority of those from the Senate. Because Democrats control both chambers, a majority of both conference delegations will be Democratic.
 
Unknown Factor: Senators
The negotiators are selected by the committee chairmen involved, in this case Mr. Rostenkowski and Mr. Bentsen, usually strictly on the basis of seniority.
Mr. Rostenkowski always exercises an iron hand over his delegation to conferences, and it usually votes the way he wants.
But senators are more independent, and Mr. Bentsen cannot automatically count on complete support from his fellow Democrats. The most probable Senate Democratic negotiators are Mr. Bentsen, Mr. Mitchell, Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York and David L. Boren of Oklahoma.
Mr. Moynihan is enthusiastic about the Rostenkowski plan, but Mr. Boren is more conservative and often votes with Republicans on tax matters. The Republican conferees will probably be Senator Dole, Bob Packwood of Oregon and John C. Danforth of Missouri. They can be expected to defend the White House position.
 
Trading on Gas Tax
The cornerstone of the Rostenkowski package is an increase in the tax rate of those with incomes above about $200,000 to 33 percent from 28 percent now, and a sharp limiting of the reductions in Medicare benefits proposed earlier. This plan would not change the Federal gasoline tax, now 9 cents a gallon, and would give a tax break on capital gains that would mostly benefit middle-income rather than wealthy taxpayers. It would, however, affect the middle class by abolishing for one year the indexing of tax brackets and personal exemptions for inflation.
The plan that will go before the Senate this week would not change tax rates but would place a limit on the itemized deductions that the rich could claim. It would increase the gasoline tax to 18.5 cents a gallon and would cut Medicare more deeply than the House plan.
Mr. Rostenkowski is a supporter of a higher gasoline tax, and his colleagues said he would probably be willing to trade in conference his provisions canceling indexing for a gasoline tax raising the same amount of revenue.
 
Hollow Statements
The House Republicans, divided between those who want to support the President and those who want to make a political statement, came down hard on the side of politics.
They announced this evening that they would offer an amendment on the House floor that freezes spending on almost all domestic programs and foreign aid and raises no new taxes. This plan would reduce the deficit over the next five years by much less than the $500 billion sought by Mr. Bush and most others in Congress.
Because they are outnumbered in the House by a 3-to-2 ratio, the Republicans have no chance of their plan's being approved.
Representative Guy Vander Jagt, a Michigan Republican, explained the position this way: ''The decision was made that there was no way we could pass a Republican plan, so let's make a statement of what we stand for.''

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET BATTLE;
Budget Turmoil Leaves G.O.P. Bereft and Besieged

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 15

 BODY:
The political turmoil in the Republican Party caused by the Federal budget impasse has left its leaders openly feuding over strategy and struggling to preserve the party's identity just three weeks before the November elections.
Republican leaders admit that the party has taken a beating and that President Bush's wavering on a budget deal and reluctance to impose higher taxes on the rich has only deepened an already pronounced rift between moderate and conservative Republicans.
A party that has long prided itself on putting forth an unmistakable message of lower taxes and less government, reflected for eight years in the steadfast philosophy of Ronald Reagan, is now under siege as the party of the privileged, a party that has been left rudderless by Mr. Bush's failure to convey any clear direction.
The reason for the Republican concern will be amply clear this week, perhaps as early as Tuesday or Wednesday, when the House is to vote on a Democratic deficit reduction plan containing several provisions that would much more heavily tax the rich. Republicans generally do not like the plan, but opposing it would only further paint them as the party of the privileged. 
Many Republicans fear an immediate fallout in next month's elections, but they hope the damage will be softened by a public frustration with all incumbents and with the Democratic-controlled Congress.
 
Loss of Relevance Is Seen
Representative Marge Roukema, a moderate Republican from New Jersey, said: ''We've lost our relevance. Most people rely on Republicans to set forth sound fiscal policy and manage the economy. The whole budget debacle has badly eroded our ability to speak out that way. Our proposal makes it look like we are favoring only the rich and not looking out for our middle-class base.''
Senator John H. Chafee, a Rhode Island Republican, asserted that ''the tarring of the brush of the rich versus poor has probably stuck.'' While he said he did not think that the President had lost his constituency, Senator Chafee conceded that ''their enthusiasm has been dulled so they might not be out there in such force as they might have been in November for our candidates.''
Douglas Bailey, a Republican political consultant, was more blunt about the political danger. ''I've talked to a whole bunch of Republican consultants out there over the last three days,'' he said. ''All of them are jittery and all of them are saying, 'Our numbers don't look good.' ''
Republican candidates are moving quickly to distance themselves from Mr. Bush, even at the advice of party officials. ''I think the Republicans were hurt when Bush's wavering back and forth,'' said Dick Waterfield, a rancher and commodity broker from Amarillo, Tex., running for Congress. ''I'm sorry that the party couldn't get together on 'no new taxes.' It looks to me that the uncertainty has hurt us.''
 
Long-Term Damage Feared
Beyond the midterm elections, some Republicans are more nervous that there will be long-term damage, both in the party's ability to govern and in erosion of political support as the 1992 Presidential campaign approaches.
''If you're speaking for the party as a group, I think they're flummoxed, in a word,'' said Craig Shirley, a leading conservative political consultant. ''The historical imperative of the party for the last 15 years, 20 years, has been tax cuts, spending restraint and less government. What has developed instead is quite obviously an image of being for higher taxes and not necessarily concern about restraint of government.''
Indeed, to hear some Republicans talk, it is as if they have already suffered devastating losses at the polls.
''We've been incompetent - they've been excellent,'' said Senator Malcolm Wallop, a conservative Republican from Wyoming, comparing his party's handling of the deficit crisis with the Democrats. ''The other side has played it for every political advantage.''
Even Charles Black, the chief spokesman for the Republican National Committee, conceded that the party's public image has been hurt. But he insisted the troubles would be short lived.
''They've done a pretty good propaganda job in the last several weeks to try to get the fairness issue raised again,'' he said of the Democrats. ''But I don't see it sticking very long. Look, if the election were Tuesday, I would say this would be a bad week. But it's not. I don't think there's any long-term party slip in the works. Our disagreement has been more over tactics than anything else.''
 
Democratic Unity Hailed
Yet, as the breach in Republican ranks deepens, Democrats are reveling in their new-found unity over making the wealthy bear a larger burden in reducing the budget deficit.
''I believe that we are witnessing the disintegration of the Republican Party,'' said Ronald H. Brown, the Democratic national chairman. ''I don't know that I have ever witnessed such internecine warfare. I think they have demonstrated that they are incapable of leading even their own party.''
John W. Kingdon, a professor of political science at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, said he was not so sure the Republican disarray would lead to significant losses in next month's elections, which, particularly in Congressional districts, usually hinge more on local issues.
But he said he expects long-term problems in how Republicans can govern, and said the party could lose conservative, working-class supporters that it won over from the Democrats.
''In order for a Republican President to accomplish anything on the Hill, he needs a solid Republican majority behind him and to chip away at some Democratic votes,'' Professor Kingdon said. ''And that coalition is really splintered now. This image of disarray will eventually get healed. But this image of protecting the rich - that can have the potential of reconstructiong the old-fashioned Democratic coalition that Reagan so assiduously sought to destroy. They could be wooed right back to the Democratic Party.''
 
Republicans Look to Bush
More than any other target, Republicans blame Mr. Bush for the party's identity crisis, and therefore say it is up to him to pull the party out of it. It is particularly important for him to restore its economic principles, they say, because the Republican faithful can no longer rally around other core issues like fighting Communism.
The obvious initial test for the President and the party to begin recovering is for Mr. Bush and Congress to finally reach a budget agreement.
''This is not something where you count bodies daily; this is not a war,'' said Senator Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska. ''The final result is what counts in this political battle.''
Senator Wallop said: ''Republicans need to come under a banner of accountability. The President needs to lay down the markers and get us back on the economic side that brought us to power.''
Still, it is not clear just how Mr. Bush should go about salvaging the party's longtime principles.
Mr. Shirley, for one, said the President must act quickly and dramatically. ''Tomorrow morning,'' the conservative consultant said, ''he should wake up and say, 'I've had it and I'm going to spend the next two years, hopefully the next six years, running against this town, vetoing every bill for every new tax and putting it on the Democratic Congress.' '' Not every Republican is so glum. ''I've seen worse times,'' said Frank J. Fahrenkopf, the Republican national chairman from 1983 to 1989. ''I was around after Watergate.''

HEADLINE: Banks Have Weak Quarter; Morgan Gains

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Several large banking companies reported weaker profits for the third quarter yesterday because of losses on commercial real estate and a paucity of new lending opportunities. An exception, though, was J. P. Morgan & Company, which rarely makes loans for commercial real estate.
Bankers' problems with real estate loans, which started in New England last year, have since spread widely, hurting the largest banks in the country as well as many regional ones.
The Chase Manhattan Corporation, the Security Pacific Corporation and the First Chicago Corporation issued earnings reports showing a rise in problems with real estate loans. 
On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Chase's shares gained 25 cents each, to $12.75; Security Pacific's added 37.5 cents each, to $20, and First Chicago's advanced 75 cents each, to $15.75. Morgan's stock rose $1.375 a share, to $34.875.
'' 'Business as usual' in the banking industry has broken down,'' said Chris Kotowski, a banking analyst at Oppenheimer & Company. Besides losses from bad real estate loans, he noted that ''there is essentially no loan growth'' and that the fat fees banks once earned from financing corporate takeovers have fallen sharply.
With the economy weakening and a recession more likely, analysts do not have much hope for a quick improvement in bank earnings. A weak economy means it will take longer to find tenants for vacant real estate projects and raises the risk that other businesses, particularly those who are deeply in debt to banks, will have trouble repaying their loans.
 
Chase Manhattan
At Chase Manhattan, the $623 million loss it disclosed yesterday was in line with an estimate it issued three weeks ago. The quarterly loss compared with a loss of $1.1 billion last year. For the latest nine months, Chase lost $527 million, compared with a loss of $840 million in the comparable 1989 period.
The third-quarter loss was caused by the setting aside of $650 million as a reserve to cover loan losses, and a $350 million charge for one-time expenses resulting from a program to cut employment by 5,000 workers. At mid-year, Chase had nearly $9.5 billion in commercial real estate loans.
According to its third-quarter earnings, about $1.5 billion in real estate loans are not paying interest, or are in such serious trouble that they are not likely to continue paying.
Chase's consumer banking business, which includes credit cards and the New York branch system, remains profitable, even though it charged off as a loss $97 million worth of consumer loans, up 37 percent from the third quarter last year.
The third-quarter results at Chase and many other large banks were much improved over the corresponding period last year, because profits in the third quarter of 1989 were depressed by the setting aside of several billion dollars in reserves to cover losses on loans to less-developed countries. Excluding the 1989 losses associated with those reserves, the trend of bank earnings has been down in recent quarters.
 
Security Pacific
At Security Pacific, in Los Angeles, third-quarter profits of $135.3 million were down nearly 27 percent from the $185.1 million reported for the comparable period of last year, and nearly 31 percent below the second quarter of the year.
In addition to bad real estate loans made by its Arizona affiliate, Security Pacific has been hurt the last year by poor-quality loans to companies in Britain and Austrialia. In the third quarter, Security Pacific had to add $240.9 million to its loan-loss reserves, more than twice the amount added a year ago, and up sharply from the $160.7 million added in the second quarter. The increase since the second quarter was primarily because of commercial real estate loans in Arizona.
Although its profits have been hurt by bad loans, Security Pacific's financial condition was strong enough that the banking company could afford to rapidly increase its consumer deposit base by acquiring savings and loan associations in California and nearby states.
Robert H. Smith, Security Pacific's president, noted that the $5.7 billion gain in consumer deposits had improved the company's finances by lowering the amounts it borrowed in wholesale markets.
At a time when business loan growth is slack, Security Pacific and many other banks have been stepping up their efforts to reduce expenses. At Security Pacific, expenses other than interest paid on borrowed funds grew only 1 percent in the last year, despite several acquisitions and an 11 percent increase in its earnings assets.
 
First Chicago
First Chicago announced a quarterly profit of $36.2 million. A year ago, the company lost $23.3 million because of charges related to loans to less-developed countries. In the second quarter, First Chicago earned $87.4 million.
The decline in profits at the banking company was caused by the addition of $160 million to its loan-loss reserves. About $120 million of that was allocated for possible losses on commercial loans, including real estate, and $40 million for losses on consumer loans. In the second quarter, First Chicago added only $85 million to such reserves.
The American National Bank and Trsut Company, a First Chicago subsidiary that specializes in lending to medium-sized companies and has a history of low loan losses, has been hurt by poor conditions in the real estate market, causing it to add $60 million to its reserves for losses.
The increase in the reserves at First Chicago was accompanied by a $242 million increase, to $535 million, in its real estate assets acquired when its borrowers defaulted. Other kinds of troubled loans fell slightly, to $800 million, from $870 million at the end of the second quarter.
 
J. P. Morgan
J. P. Morgan said its quarterly profits totaled $208 million, or $1.08 a share, up from $207 million in the second quarter, and slightly better than some analsyts had expected. In the third quarter of last year, the company posted a loss of $1.18 billion.
Reflecting a lending policy that avoids risky loans that other banks routinely make, Morgan added only $10 million to its reserves for loan losses in the period. Of Morgan's $3.3 billion in loans to highly indebted companies, only $38 million, or about 1.1 percent, were not paying interest or were in such serious trouble that a default was likely. Among other banking companies, loans to highly indebted companies include a far higher portion of troubled loans.
While corporate finance fees fell $16 million from a year ago, to $58 million, Morgan's revenues from foreign exchange and bond trading rose by $188 million, to $300 million in the quarter.

HEADLINE: Earnings Rise 27% At I.B.M.

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
I.B.M. reported yesterday that its earnings rose nearly 27 percent for the third quarter, but financial analysts said they were concerned about declining international and personal-computer sales.
At the same time, market watchers generally echoed management statements that the International Business Machines Corporation appeared to have reached the bottom of a trough financially and was realizing the benefits of the cost controls it initiated in the United States the last year.
''The worst is over,'' said Robert Djurdjevic of Annex Research, a computer industry market research firm in Phoenix. ''I can't find a weakness in their product line.'' 
The company's stock fell $4.375 early yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange from its opening of $100.625 on rumors after a morning telephone conference with analysts that I.B.M. would issue disappointing news. But those rumors proved unfounded, and the stock rebounded quickly to close at $99.25, down $1 from Friday.
 
'Continue to Make Progress'
I.B.M. said yesterday that it believed it was on track with its earlier statements projecting a planned financial recovery based on a far-reaching restructuring in December 1989. But it also noted that a worsening economy might undermine its progress.
''Despite weakening economies in the U.S. and other parts of the world and a major product transition, we continue to make progress on the course we have set for the business,'' I.B.M.'s chairman, John F. Akers, said.
For the quarter, I.B.M.'s earnings advanced to $1.11 billion, or $1.95 a share, from $877 million, or $1.51 a share, in the 1989 period. Revenues rose 6.8 percent, to $15.28 billion, from $14.31 billion in the comparable period of 1989.
The company attributed a 1.5 percent decline in hardware sales, to $9.07 billion, to the shift away from an older line of its most powerful computers. In last year's third quarter, hardware sales were $9.2 billion.
 
Shift to New Mainframe
Several analysts gave I.B.M. high marks for its managing of the transition to its new ES/9000 mainframe family of computers. Such transitions, which come only once or twice a decade, entail great risk because customers tend to stop buying existing machines.
''They've done a remarkable job,'' said Daniel Mandresh, a computer industry analyst at Merrill Lynch.
While the company said that it had continued to grow both domestically and internationally during the third quarter, analysts said the weakened dollar had a positive affect on its financial situation. I.B.M.'s revenue actually declined internationally in terms of local currency, the analysts said. Mr. Djurdjevic said he estimated the currency impact at $1.4 billion in revenue, or about 26 cents in earnings, for the third quarter.
During its morning conference call with analysts, I.B.M. said softening was evident in the Japanese market.
''International revenue fell 2 to 5 percent in terms of local currency,'' said Rick Martin, a computer industry analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities. I.B.M., based in Armonk, N.Y.. also had a difficult quarter in terms of personal computers sales, he said. ''At the high end of the PS/2 line they were flat, and at the low end they were down a ton,'' he noted.
Infocorp, a Cupertino, Calif., market research firm reported that personal computer-industry sales declined 25 percent in the United States in September from September 1989.
Separately, Joseph R. Canion, president of the Compaq Computer Corporation, said in an interview yesterday that the Houston company was standing by its earlier positive forecasts but that the European market had been sluggish recently, although England had been one of the company's brightest spots.
 
The Recession Issue
The possibility of a recession was still the largest question mark for financial analysts. Mr. Martin said that he would take $1 billion to $1.5 billion out of his forecasts for I.B.M.'s annual earnings if the country entered a recession.
I.B.M. refused to comment on a report on Saturday in the British newspaper The Guardian that it planned significant job cuts through a new early retirement plan in England, which has been hard hit as the European economy has slowed in recent months. Yesterday an I.B.M. spokesman said that because of poor financial conditions in Britain, the company was evaluating options but had not yet reached a decision. Over all I.B.M. has said the number of employees will continue to decline for the foreseeable future, but the spokesman said that he knew of no specific planned cutbacks ''in the next several months.''
Surprising many analysts, the company said that revenues for its midrange AS/400 computer were in double-digit figures worldwide. The strength of the AS/400 has contrasted sharply to the rest of the minicomputer business, which has been suffering because of the growth of the personal-computer and work-station markets.

HEADLINE: Vehicle Sales Weaken, Falling 2.5%

BYLINE: By PAUL C. JUDGE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 15

 BODY:
Domestic car sales rose 1.9 percent in early October, but sales of light trucks fell 10.7 percent, resulting in an overall decline of 2.5 percent in sales of American-built vehicles.
Analysts said concerns about a weakening economy might be catching up with vehicle sales, which had been surprisingly strong for six weeks.
''This is the sort of weakness that I expected to see develop much earlier,'' said Tom Webb, chief economist of the National Automobile Dealers' Association, which represents 16,000 dealers. ''People simply don't have the money or confidence to buy.'' 
 
Loans Are Harder to Obtain
Consumers who do venture into dealerships are finding financial institutions ''demanding more money down, or otherwise making loans harder to obtain,'' Mr. Webb said.
''The killer for this industry is not the cost of energy,'' said Ronald A. Glantz, an analyst with Dean Witter Securities in San Francisco. ''The killer is the cost of financing.''
On a seasonally adjusted basis, cars sold at an annual rate of 6.5 million units in the Oct. 1-10 period. Last year, cars sold at a 6.1 million rate in early October. So far this year, cars have sold at a 7 million rate.
Ten manufacturers that produce vehicles in the United States sold 183,925 cars in early October, and 86,935 light trucks, a category that includes mini-vans and four-wheel-drive vehicles as well as pickup trucks.
There were nine selling days in the period this year, compared with eight in the comparable period of 1989.
 
A Sign That Mileage Matters
Dealers and analysts said softer sales of light trucks might be an indication that prospective customers were having second thoughts about vehicles that were not fuel efficient.
Jack Simmons, sales manager of Orange Buick-GMC in Orlando, Fla., said sales of Buicks were steady. ''But sales of GMC trucks are only fair,'' he added. ''Some of the full-sized trucks with V-8 engines - the gas guzzlers - are feeling the pinch.''
The Big Three posted a collective sales decline of 1.5 percent in car sales during early October, while Japanese companies that build cars in the United States reported an overall increase of 42.6 percent, reflecting the new production capacity that several Japanese manufacturers have added to their American operations.
These ''transplants'' raised their share of the American car market to 10.6 percent in early October from 7.6 percent a year earlier.
 
G.M. Gains the Most
Of the Big Three, the General Motors Corporation was the biggest gainer. G.M.'s car sales rose 15.9 percent, to 89,040, compared with abnormally weak sales a year earlier. G.M.'s light-truck sales rose 7.3 percent, to 35,306.
''G.M.'s sales results last October were horrible,'' said Joseph S. Phillippi, an analyst with Shearson Lehmann Brothers in New York. The largest auto maker held clearance sales in September 1989 to sell off huge inventories before the model year ended. Many people who might have bought vehicles in October jumped to take advantage of the deals, and October results suffered.
The Ford Motor Company reported a drop of 23.8 percent in car sales, to 49,190, and light-truck sales fell 17.2 percent, to 32,052. Ford executives attributed the sharp declines to a reporting anomaly. Because the new model year started a few weeks later last year, generous rebates to clear the backlog of older-model cars and trucks generated brisk sales in early October 1989.
The Chrysler Corporation's car sales increased 2.6 percent, to 26,234. ''We're seeing a little strengthening of demand,'' a Chrysler spokesman said. But Chrysler suffered a 30 percent downturn in sales of light trucks, to 16,758; those include Jeeps and mini-vans.
The Honda Motor Company reported a sales increase of 22.5 percent, to 9,313, of cars it builds in Marysville, Ohio.

HEADLINE: Gulf Quiet, Oil Falls by $1.74 a Barrel

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
The oil market, which alternates between believing that no news is good news and fearing that silence is ominous, took the former tack yesterday, and oil fell nearly $2 a barrel on world markets.
With the Persian Gulf quiet, oil for delivery next month closed at $37.95 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, down $1.74 from Friday's close. The market hit a record close on Thursday of $40.42 on war jitters, but those seemed more distant yesterday.
''No news, no rally,'' said Christian D. Gohler of Merrill Lynch Futures. Mr. Gohler said the momentum since Wednesday was down. When the momentum was in the other direction, traders sometimes said that quiet meant lack of movement, which meant a drift toward war. 
But at the Pegasus Econometric Group of Hoboken, N.J., Peter C. Beutel said after yesterday's close, ''There was a palpable sense this morning that the tension level had dropped.'' A report from Soviet officials that Saddam Hussein was willing to withdraw from all but a small slice of Kuwait, although later denied by the Iraqi President, added to the more relaxed atmosphere, traders said.
 
Further Decline Expected
At United Energy Inc., Tom Bentz, the director of trading, said, ''The market is getting kind of tired of the news we've had; every kind of bullish story and rumor is built into the price.'' Tension has kept prices high, he said, but looking at the fundamental factors of supply and demand, ''everyone agrees that prices should probably be lower.''
The shift downward yesterday, he said, ''opens the door up for the possibility of moving back towards $34.''
Mr. Beutel said that several factors beyond the sense that tensions were lower pushed the price of crude down. Refineries are beginning their seasonal shutdowns for maintenance and for reconfiguring, to produce more heating oil and less gasoline, and thus their demand for crude is lower. And, he said, because prices for refined products have not continued to rise as sharply as crude, some refiners are reluctant to pay $40 for crude and are using stockpiled supplies instead. That has depressed demand. Numerous market experts say that production by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is nearly as high as when Kuwait and Iraq were still exporting oil. The Department of Energy has predicted for weeks that by next month world production without those two countries will be a scant million barrels a day short of what it was before the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait by Iraq, and some traders think the shortfall is smaller than that.
Products for November delivery also moved lower yesterday. Heating oil closed at $1.0207 a gallon, down 3.29 cents, and unleaded gasoline closed at 94.95 cents a gallon, down 2.18 cents A secondary effect of the embargo against Iraq, the change in the fortunes of oil companies, will become evident next week as the major companies report their third-quarter earnings. While the price of oil has slipped from its recent peak, it is still roughly double the level before the Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
 
Varied Effects on Companies
The effect will differ from company to company. Those that drill for oil will see the value of their production multiplied, but many of those that refine or sell oil will see profits shrink, because costs have grown faster than revenues.
The Oryx Energy Company of Dallas, which was formerly the exploration and production arm of the Sun Oil Company, reported yesterday that its profits rose eightfold in the third quarter. Net income rose to $48 million, or 45 cents a share, from $6 million, or 6 cents a share, in the corresponding quarter of 1989. Revenues were $514 million, up from $295 million.

HEADLINE: Japan's Trade Surplus Falls

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 15

 BODY:
Robust domestic demand and higher oil prices helped to trim Japan's bulging trade surplus in September, the Government said today.
The surplus, unadjusted for seasonal factors, shrank to $6.9 billion last month from $7.19 billion a year earlier, the Ministry of Finance said. 
Imports rose 10.3 percent, to $18.89 billion, from $17.13 billion a year ago, the third straight monthly increase, while exports grew 6.1 percent, to $25.8 billion from $24.31 billion.
The trade surplus with the United States, Japan's biggest trading partner, shrank slightly, to $4.31 billion, from $4.78 billion a year ago. September was the 12th straight month that Japanese exports to the United States declined.
Japan posted larger surpluses with the European Community and many Asian countries.
Japan's trade surplus should narrow further in coming months, economists said.

HEADLINE: 1515 Broadway In Chapter 11

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Oct. 15

 BODY:
A partnership known as 1515 Broadway Associates L.P., whose sole investment is an office building in Times Square, said today that it had filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code.
The building is owned by a partnership consisting of an affiliate of the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States as a general partner and a group of 25 limited partners. 
The building has had low occupancy rates and a declining rental income, which is insufficient to service its debt, the partnership said. The largest part of the debt has interest rates fixed in excess of 13.6 percent.
The partnership is a stand-alone entity, and the filing does not have a significant impact on Equitable.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Inch Up in Light Day

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities moved slightly higher, and interest rates inched lower, in quiet trading yesterday, as credit market participants shrugged off a big drop in the price of leading commodities, including oil.
Paced by a sharp drop in gold prices, a widely watched inflation barometer, the Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 basic food and industrial futures prices, fell by more than 4 points yesterday, its biggest one-day decline in more than three years.
''If you look at what is going on outside of oil, there is almost a deflation going on,'' one Government bond trader said. ''But the market, which has a reasonable bid to it, really isn't focusing on that fact right now.'' 
 
Sliding Since Summer
Even with a near-doubling in oil prices, the bureau's index has been sliding since the summer. Nevertheless, the message it has been sending has been lost on credit market participants.
The drop in the index is saying that ''outside of oil, it is going to be hard to make goods price increases stick,'' said Joseph R. Liro, a vice president and economist at S. G. Warburg Securities Inc.
''But with the budget accord still grinding in Washington and sabers still rattling in the Middle East, there is no hurry for accounts to commit money to the market,'' he added. ''People were happy to let the bond market sit yesterday.''
At the Treasury's weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills, the three-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 7.18 percent, little changed from the average 7.19 percent rate at last week's sale. Bids on the new six-month bills generated an average discount rate of 7.22 percent, up from 7.21 percent a week ago.
 
Budget Pact Needed for Sale
Although various Congressional committees continued to work on budget legislation, it appeared unlikely yesterday that an agreement would be reached before Thursday, when the Treasury is scheduled to sell one-year bills.
''The only way you are going to have a one-year bill auction is if the budget is passed,'' a Treasury bill trader said. Indeed, when it announced the auction last week, the Treasury said it might postpone the bill sale if a budget agreement was not in place.
Barring a budget agreement and another increase in the Federal debt ceiling, the Treasury will run out of money on Oct. 25.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 98 3/32 late yesterday, up by 7/32, to yield 8.93 percent, down from 8.95 percent late Friday.
Among note issues, the 8 3/4 percent 10-year notes were offered at 99 25/32 in late trading, up by 5/32, to yield 8.78 percent. And the 8 1/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 13/32, unchanged from late on Friday, to yield 7.89 percent.
 
Penney's Debt Offering
In other developments, the J. C. Penney Company offered investors in the investment-grade corporate bond market $200 million in seven-year notes through an underwriting syndicate led by the First Boston Corporation.
The 10 percent notes, which mature on Oct. 15, 1997, were priced at $100, or par, 1.33 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent seven-year notes at the time of pricing.
The securities are rated A-1 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and A-plus by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Activity in the secondary markets for investment-grade corporate and tax-exempt municipal bonds was very light, dealers reported.
Prices of most corporate issues rose by about an eighth of a point, traders said. Meanwhile, actively quoted municipal bond prices were unchanged to up an eighth of a point.
In the market for high-yield ''junk bonds,'' traders said prices of most issues were little changed to up slightly in thin trading.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

HEADLINE: Mergers Around World Down Sharply

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Mergers and acquisitions around the world dropped sharply in the third quarter, partly because of the economic uncertainty created by the threat of a recession in the United States and Britain, the Iraqi crisis and the doubling of oil prices.
The United States appeared headed to a strong quarter of purchases that would have pushed it ahead of Britain as the leading purchaser of companies abroad in the first nine months of the year. But early this month, the Bell Atlantic Corporation's plan to purchase half of Argentina's telephone system fell through.
This was caused by the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company's inability to raise the $2.3 billion in existing Argentine bank debt needed to swap for the control of the telephone company. But United States companies still managed to out-purchase British concerns in the third quarter. 
 
Market Viewed as Repressed
''The gulf crisis and the subsequent upheavals in the oil and stock markets have combined with the warnings of a recession and higher interest rates in many countries to repress the M. and A. market,'' said Herbert Adler, international mergers and acquisitions partner for KPMG Peat Marwick, the accounting firm, in New York.
At a value of $19.4 billion, the 478 cross-border deals around the world reported in the third quarter were down 48 percent in value and 32 percent in the number of deals, to the lowest level in two and a half years, according to the data collected by KPMG Peat Marwick.
In the second quarter of this year, 705 deals were reported, with a value of $35.1 billion for the transactions in which prices were disclosed. The deals recorded have been announced but have not necessarily been completed.
 
Drop in Nine-Month Period
For the first nine months of the year, the total number of deals reported around the world dropped to 1,884 with a total value, when prices were reported, of $84.3 billion. This was down from 2,052 deals in the first nine months of 1989 with a reported value of $88.2 billion. Several very large deals kept the reported price levels close, although the number of deals was down by 8 percent.
Acquisitions of food and beverage companies, including the $3.8 billion purchase of Jacobs Suchard by Philip Morris, and the privatization of telephone companies from New Zealand to Chile were the largest sources of deals.
In the third quarter, American companies announced or completed 141 deals with a value, in the cases where prices were reported, of $4.3 billion, after knocking out the Argentine telephone deal. This was twice the number of deals in the second quarter, but the reported value was down 39 percent, from $7.2 billion. In comparison, British deals fell to 139 with a value of $2.67 billion after a total of $11.7 billon in the first six months of the year.
 
Positioning for 1992
Despite the overall drop in acquisitions, the pressure of the economic unification of Europe in 1992 is still driving European and other companies to position themselves through mergers and acquisitions before then.
Among these countries was Sweden, where companies are making a major push to be ready for 1992, although the country is not a member of the European Community. For the first nine months, Swedish companies were involved in 110 deals with a reported value of $8.95 billion, up from 80 deals with a reported value of $827 million in the similar 1989 period.
There was also a surge during the nine-month period in acquisitions by Spanish companies, which were involved in 21 deals with a value, where prices were reported, of $3.52 billion, far above the 11 deals and $244 million in the period last year.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Mostly Higher, But Loses Ground to Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar finished higher yesterday against all leading currencies except the Japanese yen.
''Most of the activity was in cross trading, with movement out of high-yielding currencies and movement mostly into yen,'' said Ronald Holzer, chief dealer with the Harris Trust and Company in Chicago. He said traders moved out of Australian dollars after that country lowered interest rates.
In New York, the dollar finished up against most major currencies, after also rising overseas.
One British pound fetched $1.9498, down from $1.9675 on Friday. In London, the pound fell to $1.9545 from $1.9740.
But the dollar fell against the yen across the board. It closed in New York at 127.73 yen, down from 129.05 on Friday. In Tokyo, it fell to a closing 128.83 yen, from 129.98 on Friday. Later, in London, it fell to 128.05 yen. Other selected late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday rates, were: 1.5262 German marks, up from 1.5243; 1.2905 Swiss francs, up from 1.2860; 5.1120 French francs, up from 5.1055; 1,143.00 Italian lire, up from 1,142.25, and 1.1540 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1471.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday's, were: 1.5230 German marks, up from 1.5175; 1.2870 Swiss francs, up from 1.2780; 5.1035 French francs, up from 5.0555; 1.7165 Dutch guilders, up from 1.7110; 1,141.50 Italian lire, up from 1,137.25; 1.1520 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1470.

HEADLINE: ON HORSE RACING;
Track Faces A Fading Night Life

BYLINE: By Steven Crist

 BODY:
For more than a decade after opening its doors in 1976, Meadowlands Race Track offered something completely different in the New York area every fall: nighttime thoroughbred racing, a game with a look and feel of its own and an appeal so strong that some in the racing industry predicted racing under lights was the way of the future.
Sparkling and beeping with the latest in technological gadgetry, the Meadowlands touched something in the urban horseplayer that the fields of Belmont or Saratoga never could. There was neon everywhere, loud voices, and an electric energy. The bettors were far less sophisticated than their New York brethren, and there were generous payoffs to be had. 
Devoted customers called it the ''House of Action,'' not only because of the profusion of exotic bets and tempting payoffs, but also because of the current that ran through the place. The racing was never as good or as important as New York's, but there were 10 opportunities a night to pick a winner.
Pegasus, the swanky dining complex with its own glass elevator riding up the side of the clubhouse, offered a casino-style ritziness: marble floors, brass fixtures, polished wood, recessed video monitors and old racing prints lining the walls. For a dedicated horseplayer, it was a place to feel like a swell, and for casual fans, it was a fun night out. Then last year, the people suddenly stopped coming. Attendance and handle, static for nearly a decade, suddenly fell by nearly 20 percent. No one had seen the drop coming and no one could figure out why everyone had suddenly decided to stay home. Track officials could only round up the usual lineup of excuses when racing slumps: a recession, increased competition for the gambling and entertainment dollar (primarily casinos and lotteries), an aging fan base and insufficient television and press coverage of the sport.
The exodus continues. This year, attendance is down another 12 percent, despite management's best efforts to reverse the trend. A $10 million renovation project has made the place even more inviting. The track has tried clever advertising (a sign on the New Jersey Turnpike warns gamblers, ''Meadowlands: 5 miles; Atlantic City: 128 miles), an expanded track program loaded with information, mini-theaters and sports bars. Nothing seems to be working, and for the first time in its history, there are nights when the track is failing to show a profit. For most of its history, it has supported the entire Sports Complex, and continues to generate two-thirds of the operation's revenue.
The track gets from 12.11 to 16.61 percent of the betting handle with only 0.5 percent going to the state of New Jersey. (In New York, the state takes 10 times as much, a full 5 percent, and the track gets only 8.5 percent.) Meadowlands Race Track, operated by the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, continues to pay for the entire Sports Complex and remains a bigger moneymaker, even in hard times, than Giants Stadium and the Brendan Byrne Arena.
Track officials are hoping that two initiatives on the Nov. 6 ballot will help, one to permit Sunday racing and another to allow the Atlantic City casinos to take bets on races. These measures, though, will not address the larger problem of shrinking business.
One school of thinking is that more racing has led to less revenue, and that less racing could be the answer. Horseplayers' bankrolls are being depleted by too many opportunities to lose, and the sport has no sense of season - it is a continuous grind without enough openings and closings.
One possibility that Meadowlands officials are exploring is a full restructuring of the New Jersey racing season. One idea is to switch the track's thoroughbred racing dates to the spring, to trade in on heightened public interest in the sport around Triple Crown time.
Some Meadowlands' officials would like to operate a 10-week meeting from late March through the middle of June instead of the current 15-week meeting that runs from Labor Day until almost Christmas. Monmouth would then run a month longer than usual, through September, and the Meadowlands could begin its harness-racing season in October rather than January.
For such a switch to work, approval would be needed from Garden State Park, which currently runs throughbreds in the spring and harness racing in the fall. Neither of those meetings is flourishing, though, and there are nights when Meadowlands customers are betting more on the Garden State races through simulcasts than the on-track customers are. The two tracks might both benefit from some date swapping. New Jersey is the only state in the union with all three major forms of legalized gambling - casinoes, lotteries and parimutuel racing - and it also has five racetracks. Obviously, gamblers do not have infinite bankrolls, and their action is being spread too thin.

HEADLINE: Hospital Cuts Aren't Hurting Care for Elderly, Study Says

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN

 BODY:
A comprehensive national study has found that measures to limit Federal health costs have not reduced the quality of hospital care for the elderly, as many experts had feared.
Measures imposed in 1983 to shorten hospital stays for people 65 years of age and older who are insured by Medicare have not disrupted a trend of improved chances for their survival, said the study, which is being reported today in The Journal of the American Medical Association.
But the cost-cutting measures did increase the likelihood that an elderly patient would be discharged in a medically unstable condition. The percentage of such patients rose to 14.7 from 10.3 before the measures began, said the team of 19 researchers at the University of California at Los Angeles and the Rand Corporation who did the study. 
 
Survival Rates Compared
Those who were discharged in medically unstable condition were 50 percent more likely to die within 90 days than were those who were medically stable. The researchers said the rise in deaths slowed the overall improvement in survival rates, but did not reverse it.
Dr. Bruce C. Vladeck, president of the United Hospital Fund in New York City, a nonprofit research and philanthropic organization whose goal is to improve health care, said it was ''reassuring'' to find that hospital costs could be lowered without sacrificing quality. The study provided ''a more powerful methodology to pull together the bits and pieces of evidence'' that the cost-containment measures had not harmed the overall quality of care, Dr. Vladeck said in an interview.
Medicare now reimburses hospitals at a fixed amount for specific categories of illness called diagnosis-related groups, or D.R.G's, a system that the medical association has opposed. Previously, the payments were simply based on what the hospital charged.
 
Cut in Short-Term Stays
The impact has been significant. Stays in short-term hospitals were cut to 8.5 days last year compared with 10 days in 1983, according to the Health Care Financing Agency, the Federal agency that administers the Medicare program.
The study of 14,000 Medicare patients found a 1.1 percent drop in death rates for the five most serious diseases covered by Medicare in the critical 30 days after admission, when most deaths occur. The drop was from 16.5 percent to 15.7. The 180-day death rates were essentially unchanged at 29.6 percent, compared with 29 percent before the measures were imposed, the researchers said.
The study involved patients who were treated at 297 hospitals in 30 areas in five states. The patients suffered from five diseases that make up 19 percent of Medicare admissions and 32 percent of deaths within 30 days. The researchers compared representative cases of patients cared for in the same hospitals in 1981-1982 and in 1985-1986.
 
Medical Records Reviewed
Over all, the length of hospital stay declined 24 percent, to 11 days from 14.4 days The length of stay fell for each of the five diseases: 21 percent for congestive heart failure, 18 percent for heart attacks, 14 percent for pneumonia, 32 percent for strokes and 28 percent for hip fractures.
To measure the quality of care, the researchers reviewed medical records and developed statistical tools to adjust for how sick the patients were at the time of their admission. With the cooperation of Health Care Financing Agency and the hospitals, the researchers said they had successfully accessed 96 percent of the records requested.
The study showed that physicians and nurses appeared to be providing better physical examinations, diagnostic testing and treatments for elderly patients. The percentage of patients receiving poor or very poor care declined to 12 percent from 25 percent.
But poor care remained a troublesome issue. For example, 30 percent of the patients were judged to have received very poor care, and their death rate 30 days after hospital admission was almost double the 17 percent rate for those receiving very good care.
 
System Imposed by Fiat
The Government imposed D.R.G.'s not as a result of an experiment but nearly simultaneously by fiat in 1983, raising fears that the cost-cutting measures would lead to more deaths and a serious decline in quality of care.
Contrary to widespread belief, the study found no statistically significant increase in the number of patients spending prolonged periods in nursing homes after discharge.
Another surprising finding was that patients were sicker at admission than before the system was introduced. Many experts had predicted that financial incentives to cut the length of stays and substitute lower cost services would favor admission of the less seriously ill. The researchers said they presumed that the finding was the result of stringent admission reviews by professional review organizations that the Government established to monitor quality and appropriateness of care.
Patients who were discharged ''quicker and sicker'' in medically unstable conditions were more likely to die within 90 days than were those who went home in medically stable condition. Among the problems contributing to the medical instability of such patients were rapid heart beats, fast breathing rates and urinary and fecal incontinence, problems that were not present at the time of admission.
 
Lower Death Rate Likely
The senior author, Dr. Robert H. Brook, said the nature of the study did not allow his team to determine ''how many deaths could have been prevented if patients were kept in the hospital longer or if there had been better plans for their care at home.''
The researchers estimated that the 180-day death rate would have been at least an additional two-tenths of 1 percent lower by 1986 if there were no deaths because of instability and other problems at discharge.
''Learning at a hospital level what causes instability at discharge and how to reduce it should become a major joint activity of the hospital administration and medical staff,'' the researchers said.
To reduce the risk of premature death and the burden on families caring for such elderly patients at home, Dr. Brook said in an interview, Federal officials, hospital administrators and doctors need to develop plans that are as explicit for the care of patients after discharge as those made at time of admission to a hospital.
Dr. Gail Wilensky, the administrator of the Health Care Financing Agency, which paid $3.9 million for the study, wrote in an editorial that ''the reports place the burden of proof on those who doubt that we can provide better care at lower cost today.''
In another editorial James P. LoGerfo, medical director of the Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, wrote that restraint of capital improvements might have prevented hospitals from providing even better care than what was noted. But Dr. LoGerfo said the study could not answer the question because the effects may take years to detect.
Because the D.R.G. system is still in transition, Dr. Brook's team said the program needs continual monitoring to make sure future cost restraints do not have adverse effects.
''We have a long way to go to make hospital quality as good as we would like it to be,'' Dr. Brook said.

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET BATTLE;
HOUSE APPROVES DEMOCRATIC PLAN TO REDUCE DEFICIT

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 16

 BODY:
Eleven days after it rejected the budget compromise struck by President Bush and Congressional leaders, the House of Representatives voted tonight for a new Democratic plan that would sharply raise the income taxes of the wealthy.
The focus of the effort to reduce the deficit now shifts to the Senate, where a vote is expected Wednesday on a package supported by President Bush that would force the middle class to bear more of the brunt of higher taxes and lower spending.
A showdown is likely at the end of this week, when the Government's authority to spend money lapses. The President promised again today that he would veto any measure like the House's and that he would close most of the Government if a budget suitable to him had not been enacted. 
 
A Highly Partisan Vote
This evening the House approved the tax and spending plan, offered as an amendment to an overall budget measure, by a highly partisan vote of 238 to 192. Only 10 Republicans joined 228 Democrats in supporting the plan; 164 Republicans and 28 Democrats voted against it.
After the vote on the amendment, the House voted, 227 to 203, to approve the full legislation, which is the core of a five-year package meant to reduce the deficit by $40 billion this year and $500 billion over five years. The deficit is now about $300 billion. At a campaign rally in Glen Ellyn, Ill., today, Mr. Bush called the measure in the House ''a Democratic tax plan'' and added, ''It raises the income taxes of the working men and women in this country, and I am not going to do that.''
While the House plan would delay the adjustments in taxes for inflation, which could cost middle-class taxpayers a few hundred dollars a year, by far the biggest increase would affect people with incomes over $200,000. The plan the President supports would leave income taxes alone but would raise other taxes, like those on gasoline, that primarily affect middle-income people.
Late today, Mr. Bush canceled plans to attend the second game of the World Series in Cincinnati on Wednesday after a phone conversation with the Republican leaders in the Senate and House, Bob Dole of Kansas and Robert H. Michel of Illinois. The White House press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, said the two leaders had told Mr. Bush that the talks were ''all coming to a head in a day or two.''
Today's House votes followed a spirited debate in which Democrats took the political offensive on an economic issue for the first time in years. With all factions of the party united, they seized the chance to portray themselves as the party of ordinary Americans and their Republican opponents as the patrons of the fat cats. ''Soak the rich'' became a Democratic war cry as well as a Republican epithet.
 
'Economic McCarthyism'
''The middle class is angry,'' said Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the majority leader. Americans, he continued, believe that ''everybody's got to pay their fair share; the people at the top should have the highest rate.'' And he asked, ''Doesn't that make sense?''
But Republicans accused the Democrats of pandering to voters without grasping the dire economic consequences. ''In the last few weeks,'' said Mr. Michel, ''we've heard the sounds of economic McCarthyism, the savage cry of class warfare.''
Republicans maintained, in the word of Representative Mickey Edwards of Oklahoma, that they had been ''gagged,'' prohibited by the Democratic majority from offering a plan that would have slashed spending for domestic programs and foreign aid but raised no new taxes.
Democrats countered that the Republican proposal broke the rules of the budget outline approved by Congress last week because it would have reduced the deficit by only $400 billion over five years, not the $500 billion required by the outline.
 
'They Come Up With a Mouse'
''When it's time to put up, they come up with a mouse,'' said Representative Leon E. Panetta, the California Democrat who heads the Budget Committee.
On a procedural motion that amounted to a test vote on the Republican plan, the Republicans lost on a nearly straight party-line vote of 241 to 184.
The party-line votes tonight were in sharp contrast with the vote early in the morning of Oct. 5, when the House handily turned down the budget compromise that President Bush and the Congressional leaders had reached after a month of intense negotiations. Then, liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans joined forces to defeat a package that both found objectionable.
Today Representative Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat, made one of the few statements both sides could agree on. ''This is a debate about the direction of the country,'' she asserted. ''It is about what gets cut and how much. It is about who pays and how much.''
 
Taxing the Richest
The plan approved tonight would raise the taxes of all but the very poor by suspending the adjustment of taxes for inflation by one year. But unlike other budget plans, it would raise the top tax rate, put a surtax on millionaires and allow most of the benefits of a capital-gains tax break to fall on the middle class. The taxes of the richest 1 percent of taxpayers in America, those with incomes over $200,000, would rise by an average of $11,000 a year.
Furthermore, the House scrapped many aspects of the deal struck by the President and the Congressional leaders that had generated the most opposition. Gasoline taxes would not be raised, Medicare cuts would be limited, home heating oil would not be taxed and people thrown out of work would not have to wait two weeks for their first unemployment check.
The budget debate has galvanized House Democrats like no other issue in years. Late in the debate, with the House chamber jammed but the outcome no longer in doubt, Representative Guy Vander Jagt, Republican of Michigan, argued that rich Americans were already overtaxed.
From a seat in the back, Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of Manhattan, called out, ''Let's hear it for the rich!''
But the Democrats' euphoria may be short-lived. The more conservative Senate is considering a budget bill that has the backing of the Bush Administration, goes easier on the wealthy and harder on the middle class than does the House bill, though many provisions are identical.
It will be up to a conference committee to reconcile differences in the Senate and House versions.

HEADLINE: MIDEAST TENSIONS;
IRAQIS ARE HINTING AT A COMPROMISE; U.S. REJECTS TERMS

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 16

 BODY:
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said today that President Saddam Hussein of Iraq had indicated tentative interest in a compromise settlement of the Kuwait crisis but that Washington considered the terms unacceptable and continued to insist that Iraq withdraw from Kuwait before any talks begin.
Mr. Baker said at a news conference that the vague compromise proposals being floated by Baghdad suggested it might be willing to pull out of Kuwait if it were allowed to retain ''Bubiyan Island, access to the gulf and things like that.''
Bubiyan is an uninhabited island off Kuwait that controls access to Umm Qasr, Iraq's only military port on the Persian Gulf.
 
Dispute Over Oilfield
The Rumaila oilfield in northwest Kuwait is considered another strategic prize that Baghdad would insist on retaining, even if it pulled out of the rest of the country. The huge field is partly under Iraq and partly under Kuwait and Baghdad has accused the Kuwaitis of stealing oil from Iraq's part. 
The overall oil production of Kuwait averaged 1.8 million barrels a day in 1989, but it has never disclosed how much oil it has pumped from Rumaila.
Administration officials say they believe that the Iraqi feelers are part of a strategy of President Hussein aimed at limiting Washington's room for maneuver. By hinting that he is ready to consider diplomatic solutions, they say, the Iraqi leader hopes to reduce the prospect that the United States and its allies will soon use military force.
 
Pressures Start to Build
By floating diplomatic hints, the officials added, he also hopes to create cracks in the coalition aligned against Iraq. This coalition includes countries with different interests, different staying powers and different attitudes toward the use of force in the gulf.
Administration officials also acknowledge that pressures are starting to build to at least try negotiating with Baghdad as the United Nations sanctions produce no change in Iraqi behavior and the costly resort to military force increasingly seems the only way likely to force a total Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait.
This was apparent today in Rome where Yevgeny Primakov, a member of the Soviet Presidential Council, met the Italian Prime Minister, Giulio Andreotti, on the first leg of a trip that will also take him to Paris and Washington, where he will meet President Bush on Friday. Mr. Primakov, who returned from a visit to Baghdad on Oct. 6, was said by Italian officials to have told Mr. Andreotti that President Hussein would be ready for a negotiated settlement provided the West did not make ultimatums or threaten military intervention.
Officials said Mr. Baker's remarks were deliberately planned to puncture the trial balloons being floated by Baghdad and to quash any suggestions that a compromise be struck with President Hussein. The Secretary spoke at a news conference called to announce a new program for rewarding people who provide information to convict terrorists.
 
No Formal Proposal
Mr. Baker said that since the Iraqi leader's first overture two months ago when he said he would withdraw from Kuwait if Israel were to withdraw from the occupied territories, Washington had ''seen some suggestions that would indicate that other things are negotiable as far as Baghdad is concerned.''
The Secretary did not elaborate on those overtures, but officials said he was referring to suggestions by Arab leaders like King Hussein of Jordan, Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, Arab diplomats at the United Nations and Arab foreign ministers who have recently been to Baghdad, all indicating that Iraq might be ready to make a deal for Bubiyan Island or some oilfields. The officials emphasized that no formal proposal had been made by President Hussein or anyone else.
Had the Iraqi leader confined his initial invasion of Kuwait to the seizure of strategic areas such as Rumaila and Bubiyan, it is likely the United States would not have mounted the international campaign it has undertaken. The American Ambassador to Baghdad, April Glaspie, said in an interview last month that Washington never thought Iraq would seize all of Kuwait. But since it has done so, Washington is not prepared to consider any compromises.
''If the international community were willing to go for that, we would be permitting an aggressor to profit from his unprovoked aggression,'' Mr. Baker said. ''Let me say that our diplomatic agenda has been clear from the very beginning. We seek full implementation of the Security Council's resolutions. We are indeed unwilling to participate in a search for partial solutions. We think that the United Nations resolution should be implemented and implemented fully.''
 
Baker Recalls the 30's
Pressed on whether the Iraqi leader had shown any interest in an unconditional withdrawal, Mr. Baker responded: ''All we've seen so far has suggested that there may be some interest in what we would characterize as a partial solution. That is, some interest in a negotiated arrangement that would enable him to claim benefits from his unprovoked aggression against a small neighbor. This is the principle that the United States and most of the international community are standing against.
''We made this mistake in the 30's,'' added Mr. Baker, ''We did not stand up in opposition to unprovoked aggression. And we remember what happened in Europe when we refused to take a principled stand.''
The Administration's official position is that to approach the Iraqi leader now and offer him a diplomatic way out would only signal to him that bargaining had opened and that he could expect at least some reward for pulling out of Kuwait. Administration officials are therefore always careful not to even hint at a compromise.
The weakness of this approach, as former President Jimmy Carter argued in an essay in Time magazine this week, is that the notion that Iraq would unconditionally withdraw under the pressure of economic sanctions alone and without any negotiated settlement is questionable.
 
Credible Threat of Force
''So far, the Bush Administration has not acknowledged the need for negotiations or exploratory talks, which might imply weakness or willingness to reverse adamant public statments,'' Mr. Carter argued. ''Only unconditional surrender following a total military victory can remove the need for negotiated settlements.''
Administration officials acknowledged that for sanctions to be effective in pushing Iraq out of Kuwait they would have to be coupled with a credible threat to use force. The Iraqi leader, they say, has to be convinced that he really has only two choices: to stay in Kuwait and lose everything or leave and survive. Unless Mr. Hussein believes that, the officials say, he will never be serious about withdrawing.
The problem, Administration officials increasingly acknowledge, is that it is difficult to make the Iraqi President believe that he has only two choices when the United States must work within an international coalition, some of whose main members are reluctant to use force under any circumstances.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Orders Agencies to Draft Plans for $1 Billion in Cutbacks

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
The Dinkins administration told city agencies yesterday to prepare to cut more than $1 billion in programs and services from their operating budgets over the next 21 months to help close expected budget gaps.
Most agencies were ordered to recommend cuts equal to 4 percent of their budgets for the current fiscal year, which ends June 30, and 10 percent of their spending plans for the fiscal year that starts July 1.
The public school system, the City University, city-run hospitals and the Fire Department would be spared to some degree. They would only be forced to cut half the amount of other agencies. In addition, the Police, Correction and Probation Departments, district attorneys and other criminal-justice agencies would be asked to trim from 1 percent to 5 percent of their budgets, but through internal productivity gains over the next two years. 
The largest cuts would be more than twice the size of the biggest such annual cuts made over the last decade, and 10 times the size of other annual cuts. City officials have not calculated the concrete effects of such reductions on services, but they said they would be severe, from sharply scaled-back street cleaning and garbage pickups to closing libraries and firehouses, and possibly thousands of layoffs.
Most agencies must propose contingency cuts of an additional 2.5 percent in their budgets for the coming fiscal year in case projected city budget gaps of at least $300 million for the rest of this fiscal year and $1.4 billion for the next year worsen. Because by law the city's budget must be balanced, cuts are needed to close the gaps between expected revenues and projected expenditures.
''New York City is on track,'' Mayor David N. Dinkins told a luncheon meeting of the Staten Island Chamber of Commerce. ''And economic storms will not overwhelm us. Without a doubt, and beyond debate, we maintain our fiscal integrity.''
 
'Extremely Unfortunate'
In a memorandum to all agency heads, the city's Budget Director, Philip R. Michael, said, ''It is extremely unfortunate that large layoffs may be an inevitable part'' of the plans for the next fiscal year.
Ten days ago, Mr. Michael warned that 15,000 layoffs would be needed, but he said yesterday that it was too early to say just where the cuts might come and that the targets did not mean decisions had been made on just what would be cut.
The Budget Director issued his memo after Mayor Dinkins held a meeting with his commissioners and agency heads at City Hall. The gloomy orders came on the same day that the city opened a new round of joint talks with two of its major labor unions, and it inevitably put more pressure on the bargaining.
 
A 'Benchmark'
Outlining the possible cuts was the sort of ''benchmark'' that Mr. Dinkins promised members of the State Financial Control Board last week that he would make public as he prepares to submit the required modifications of the city's budget to the board next month, and in January.
''I'm not prepared,'' Mr. Michael said, ''to give you specific programs, other than to say that it will be massive cutbacks as far as agency services are involved. You will see that across the board.
''Layoffs should be the final piece that an agency would layer on in order to hit their target.''
Agencies are to submit their recommendations to the city budget office in stages over the coming weeks, with the first of them, aimed at cuts in the current fiscal year, due next Wednesday, and final decisions about next year's major cuts to be made by the Mayor by January.
 
'The Right Direction'
Commenting on the latest action, Allen J. Proctor, executive director of the Financial Control Board, which monitors the city's finances, said, ''I think it's definitely a move in the right direction. Whether that ultimately is the best solution, we'll see. But fundamentally, they've started a process to identify the source and feasibility of substantial reductions in spending, and that's abolutely the right direction.''
Even if fully put into effect, the proposed targets would produce enough savings to close only part of the projected deficit for next year. Officials have acknowledged that the rest might have to be made up through new taxes or other revenues.
For the current fiscal year, Mr. Michael said, all the reductions would save about $330 million to help close an estimated gap of about that size, including a projected $150 million shortfall in tax revenues and a similar amount in increased costs.
In the next fiscal year, the reductions would save $840 million, against the estimated gap of at least $1.4 billion. If the contingency cuts were made, they would save another $195 million, officials said.
 
'A Heavy Lift'
Peg Breen, a spokeswoman for the City Council, which would, in practice, have to approve most major budget changes, said, ''This appears to be prudent, but it is a heavy lift for this year, and the Council will carefully monitor the agency plans to insure that quality-of-life services are not disproportionately cut.''
Ms. Breen said the Council's Speaker and majority leader, Peter F. Vallone, a Queens Democrat, was especially concerned that essential services like garbage collection not be ravaged by any cuts.
Mr. Michael's memorandum warned agency heads that ''this is not an exercise to be taken lightly'' and said the Mayor would meet with the officials himself to assure that they adhered to the required timetable.
 
Productivity Gains
The Budget Director said all agencies should first try to save money through productivity gains, including better cost controls, better deployment of workers, increased use of computers and technology and, in the uniformed services, for example, using civilians to free officers doing desk jobs for other work.
First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel said Mr. Dinkins had told the commissioners that ''maximum efforts ought to be made to streamline administrative areas before sacrificing line operations or services.''
But, Mr. Steisel added, ''inevitably, there may have to be some very difficult choices about what programs go forward or do not.''
City officials said savings generated from a previously imposed partial hiring freeze and a moratorium on most raises could be applied by the agencies toward this year's cost-cutting targets.

HEADLINE: Old Marxist Returns, With Hope for South Africa

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES

 BODY:
In the world of emerging political movements Joe Slovo is an anachronism, an avuncular white man lionized in South African black townships as a symbol of resistance against apartheid, a committed Marxist with an ideology that many thought had collapsed with the Berlin wall and a politician glad-handing his way across South Africa after years as a clandestine guerrilla leader.
Mr. Slovo, the leader of the South African Communist Party, is the highest-ranking white in the African National Congress. He was in Manhattan, on his first visit to the United States, for the International Conference on the Future of Socialism, a meeting of Marxists from about 20 countries that was sponsored by The Monthly Review and the New York Marxist School.
Mr. Slovo's return to South Africa in May ended 27 years in exile, where he helped lead the struggle against white minority rule, and has already made him an important South African political figure. 
 
Greenwich Village Hospitality
But the 64-year-old Mr. Slovo, the son of Lithuanian immigrants, has had to adjust to South Africa, just as many of the five and a half million whites in the country have had to adjust to him.
''There is a marked difference in the relationships between people since I left,'' he said in an interview. ''The way blacks walk down the street is different. They walk like people who are about to take over.''
''When I left the country, blacks couldn't be loitering in any part of the white city area without a special permit,'' he said, seated at the kitchen table in the Greenwich Village apartment of a friend. ''Now they are actually living there. The whole atmosphere is different, in quite a radical way.''
''I remember when I first got back to Johannesburg, I saw a black man walking down the street holding the hand of a blond white woman, and I went into a sort of panic,'' he said. ''I was sure a mob was about to appear to attack them. The whole integration of blacks into the society, into positions in business, is new. When I left, you would never even see a black behind a cash register.''
On his United States visit, he said, ''I never expected a year ago that I would get here and even less that I would get here from Johannesburg.''
 
Familiar Places
Mr. Slovo flew back to Cape Town as part of the African National Congress's negotiating team last May. But when he broke away from talks with the Government a week later, he headed to the neighborhood in Johannesburg where he and his first wife began their married lives.
His wife, Ruth First, was killed by parcel bomb in Maputo, Mozambique, in 1982. His family life was often in shambles because of his political activity.
''They went through a lot of pain,'' he said of the couple's three daughters. ''They went through periods of terrible insecurity as a result of our commitment.'' He married his present wife, Helena Dolny, about three years ago.
Mr. Slovo was outside South Africa in 1963 and 1964, when most of the members of the congress's military high command were arrested and sentenced to prison. He worked to resurrect the armed movement from outside the country. During the last decade he traveled incognito from country to country and house to house.
Now, back in South Africa, he is trying to make peace with a whirlwind of experiences and emotions.
''Each day new memories are evoked, driving or walking around the city,'' Mr. Slovo said.
''Not all my memories were happy ones,'' he said. ''There is a great deal that people went through, and one pauses and remembers all over again the sort of tribulations of friends.''
 
Sympathetic Welcomes
Mr. Slovo, labeled a terrorist by the white Government, said he was unprepared for the reception he has been given by both whites and blacks.
''Before leaving in 1963 I was increasingly feeling a sense of isolation from the community in which I lived, because of fear,'' he said. ''This has changed completely. Not only the whites I knew, but the whites I didn't know, come to me in the street and say that while they do not agree with what we believe in, they want to wish us good luck because we are their only hope.'' But it was his reception in black townships that overwhelmed him.
''I realized what the regime had done for me,'' he said. ''They were a very effective public relations firm. Most of these people who expressed their adulation for me as a person, and what I stood for, had never heard me, or ever seen me, or even considered what my ideas were like.
''I was astonished to find names of streets put up after me, schools and songs. It is quite worrying, because one realizes one has to try to measure up to something that perhaps one doesn't even deserve.''
Mr. Slovo remains a driven man who, while casting off his Stalinist past, firmly believes in socialism. He says that in South Africa, capitalism has only enriched the white minority. He sees the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, as the guiding light for the modern socialist movement.
He spends much of his energy trying to assure whites that he has no intention of swooping into their homes to confiscate their property. At the same time, he insists that the nation's economic structures must change.
''We are all doing our best to de-demonize our movement,'' Mr. Slovo said. ''We find that when we are together with even some of the most hardline whites, they at least begin to have a doubt about their impressions of us.''
''I have the advantage,'' Mr. Slovo said, ''of starting off with such a bad reputation that if they see me smiling, they think maybe I'm not so bad.''

HEADLINE: Tokyo Journal;
Tatami or Colonial, a House Is Wishful Thinking

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 16

 BODY:
Hiroshi Akizuki, a 27-year-old computer programmer, wandered into a Queen Anne-style model house with his girlfriend the other day, peered up the giant central staircase, inspected the elegant brick fireplace in the parlor and pondered the question of whether he would ever live like this.
''It's probably impossible,'' Mr. Akizuki said, shaking his head as he stood on the stoop of the building, which would look more like home in the New Jersey suburbs than the center of Tokyo. ''The house is not so expensive, but who could afford the land underneath?''
He consoled himself with the thought that for three-quarters of a million dollars ''you don't even get a single tatami room,'' referring to the traditional straw-mat rooms found in almost every Japanese house. 
The house he was looking at, in fact, is sitting on some of the world's most expensive real estate: an entire village of oversized American- and European-style houses, complete with some suburban streets, improbably situated in a vacant railroad yard just steps from the neon and noise of Shimbashi, once this city's most famous geisha quarter.
 
'The Kids Want Western'
The idea was to fuel the huge popularity here of Western-style Colonials, ski chalets and stately English country houses - all imports, the Government notes - which Japan's nouveaux riches jam into tiny lots and fill with Jacuzzis, gold-plated faucets and computer-controlled kitchens.
But the housing display, it turns out, is teaching Tokyoites about more than just the novelty of two-by-four construction. It is also debunking one of this country's favorite myths: that the Japanese are a decidedly middle-class society, where few are much better off than their neighbors.
The only serious buyers in Shimbashi are people like Kozo Kayo, a 70-year-old retiree, who bought his land long before the Imperial Palace was worth more than the state of Florida. Now the site of his apartment building in Kawasaki is worth millions and he is preparing to sell it in order to build a ''two generation'' house.
''If it was just me, I would build something Japanese-style,'' Mr. Kayo said, wandering out of a house done half in Japanese tatami, half in automated luxury. ''But the kids want Western. And if I don't build it for them, where will they live?''
 
Building Spree by the Elderly
Mr. Kayo is one of the millions of elderly Japanese who are on a rebuilding spree. But for everyone else, the model houses in Shimbashi just drive home the fact that the possibility of home ownership seems more remote than ever.
For young couples, Tokyo's housing show is almost a cruel joke, a chance to walk wide-eyed through three-bedroom houses the way tourists in Beverly Hills gawk at the mansions of stars.
''At one time building a house was a symbol of success in life,'' Kazuro Santo, an official of the Federation of Home Construction, said recently. ''For many men, that is still the case. But now young people come to see the houses simply to serve their dreams. When they can build, no one knows.'' Once, the land crisis was Tokyo's problem, not Japan's. No longer. A recent Government survey showed that, at long last, the huge runup in the price of land in the nation's capital was finally leveling off, increasing only 10 percent last year. But in Osaka, the country's second largest hub, prices shot up 45 percent last year, and in Kyoto, the ancient capital, nearly 50 percent.
The survey suggested what many people have long suspected: The Government's much-publicized effort to put a lid on property prices - ordering banks to cut back their lending and giving Government agencies the right to reject big, speculative transactions - has largely failed. Increasingly, young house-hunters are beginning to wonder whether national leaders who talk about the ''land crisis'' as Japan's most urgent domestic issue have the incentive to solve it.
''It is difficult to believe politicians on any subject,'' said Norio Ishikawa, a 31-year-old builder trying to scratch together the money for a ''Sweden House'' he saw on display in Tokyo. ''It is impossible to believe them about land.''
More than 60 percent of Japanese families are landholders. They are also the bedrock of the Liberal Democratic Party, and few seriously believe that the party is interested in diminishing their constituents' biggest single asset.
While it is hard to find a Government official these days unwilling to issue the standard line about how skyrocketing land prices pose a grave national threat, it is harder still to find one who, in the next breath, fails to note that those property values are the foundation of Japan's booming economy.
A committee put together by the Prime Minister's office suggested that the Government adopt an official policy to put home ownership within reach of ordinary working people. That idea was greeted with silence. A Government plan to impose a tax on corporate land, especially unused tracts that could be freed up for housing developments, has met a storm of opposition from business.
 
More Disputes Taken to Court
Families themselves are increasingly doing battle. The Mainichi Shimbun, one of Japan's leading dailies, reported recently that the number of disputes over property inheritance spilling into the courts was up by more than 30 percent in the last four years. And more and more people tell polltakers that they identify themselves as members of the ''lower class'' rather than the great, undifferentiated middle in which they have long felt secure.
But if there are resentments, most Japanese are well mannered enough to keep them well hidden. The apartment renters who jam their families into tiny three-room apartments at night emerge in the morning smiling as they sweep the streets with next-door neighbors who own fairly spacious houses.
More likely than not, those homeowners are tearing down their old, drafty, wooden Japanese houses and replacing them with something in brick and stucco, often with a carport.
The other day in a quiet neighborhood in the southern part of Tokyo a middle-aged woman whose family rents a tiny apartment stood and watched as workers unloaded big kitchen cabinets for a new house under construction next door.
''Those cabinets,'' she said flatly, ''are bigger than my kitchen.''

HEADLINE: EARLIER HARM SEEN IN GLOBAL WARMING

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS

 BODY:
After two years of study, an international group of scientists working under United Nations auspices has found that global warming could cause serious environmental damage starting in the early years of the next century, long before the maximum temperature levels predicted by many scientists are reached.
And for the first time, they recommended establishing limits beyond which the average global temperature and sea level should not be permitted to rise, lest the world be subjected to serious and ever-increasing risks.
These limits are well below the levels that another international scientific panel said last June will ultimately result if heat-trapping gases, mainly carbon dioxide, continue to pour into the atmosphere at the present rate.
A report issued yesterday also includes a detailed analysis of measures that might bring the expected warming under control and concludes that if the measures are aggressively pursued, the limits can be achieved. 
 
Steps Toward Formal Treaty
The conclusions, recommendations and supporting analyses will furnish grist for the Second World Climate Conference starting in Geneva on Oct. 29, a gathering sponsored by the United Nations at which governments from around the world expect to take the first steps toward what they hope will be a formal treaty aimed at controlling global warming.
Two international groups of scientists have been studying the problem, both with United Nations sponsorship. One, operating as part of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, was formed in late 1988 to advise the governments attending the World Climate Conference. The other, which was formed in 1986 and was the progenitor of the intergovernmental panel, has no government affiliation but rather is an association of independent scientists called the Advisory Group on Greenhouse Gases.
The independent group's report, issued yesterday in London, Stockholm and New York, goes beyond the scientific assessment of the intergovernmental panel, made public last June, in attempting to set targets for the control of global warming.
Among the practical measures that the scientists said might be taken to limit the warming were improved energy efficiency, greater reliance on natural gas, reforestation and the adoption of alternative energy sources that are both technologically and economically feasible. The sources include solar, wind, geothermal and biomass technologies. ''Limiting emissions so we can stay below the minimums should be attainable,'' said Michael Oppenheimer, senior scientist for the Environmental Defense Fund, who was the chairman of the working group on control measures.
 
Rate of Increase Forecast
In June, the scientists advising the intergovernmental group predicted that under what it called the ''business as usual'' scenario, the average global temperature would rise by nearly two degrees Fahrenheit by the year 2025 and by more than five degrees by the end of the next century. The rate of increase, which scientists say is as important as the absolute increase because of the difficulty of adjusting to rapid climatic change, was predicted at about half a degree per decade.
In the report issued yesterday, the independent scientists said that to minimize the risk of environmental damage, the rate of increase should be held below one-fifth of a degree per decade.
An absolute increase beyond 1990 of more than about two degrees above pre-industrial levels, it said, ''may elicit rapid, unpredictable and non-linear responses that could lead to extensive ecosystem damage.'' Non-linear responses refer, for example, to sudden jumps in global temperature rather than even, gradual increases.
The report last June of the intergovernmental scientific panel said that the world has already warmed by about half a degree to one degree since the industrial age began, but scientists do not know whether this rise was caused by greenhouse gases emitted as a result of human activity or whether it is attributable to natural climatic variability and therefore, possibly, is temporary.
 
'Severe Impacts' Without Action
The report said that the atmosphere may already contain enough heat-trapping gases to push the global temperature above the two-degree target. ''This means that unless we take very prompt and significant actions to reduce greenhouse emissions, we're very likely to experience severe impacts,'' said Peter Gleick, a co-chairman of the working group dealing with targets. He directs the global environmental programs of the Pacific Institute in Berkeley, Calif., a non-profit research institute.
The report established an ''upper limit'' of about 3.5 degrees in temperature increase since the start of the industrial age ''beyond which the risks of grave damage to ecosystems, and of non-linear responses, are expected to increase rapidly.''
While the voluminous study was reviewed in detail by other scientists before it was issued, not all authorities were initially prepared to give it unqualified endorsement.
''It sounds as if they've taken the worst-case scenarios and tried to make the case for a maximum effort,'' said William D. Nordhaus, a Yale University economist who cautioned that he had not yet had a chance to read the report. He has been the chairman or co-chairman of a number of National Academy of Sciences panels looking into global warming.

HEADLINE: MIDEAST TENSIONS;
Iraq's Seesaw Diplomacy: Threats and Entreaties

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Oct. 16

 BODY:
Saddam Hussein is sending decidedly mixed political signals about his intentions toward Kuwait, thus causing Arab and Western moods and expectations to shift and complicating efforts by the United States and its allies to forge a coherent strategy for getting Iraqi forces out of Kuwait.
With every new Iraqi statement, stock and oil market prices rise or fall, and analysts alter their assessments about whether the prospects of war grow more imminent or more remote. As a result, policy makers in Washington and other allied capitals are being constantly kept off balance, drawing up contingency plans for war one day and for diplomacy the next.
Moreover, Saddam Hussein, by alternating between hints that Iraq might compromise and end the Persian Gulf crisis and denials of any such possibility, has attempted with some success to exploit tensions in the American-led alliance against him. No Negotiating Room, but . . . The latest signal from Baghdad has been hard-line. On Sunday, officials insisted that not even a war would prompt Iraq to relinquish Kuwait as its 19th province. Taha Yassin Ramadan, deputy to Saddam Hussein in the leadership, said Iraq was prepared ''to confront whatever happens'' to hold onto the emirate. On Monday, Latif Jassem, Iraq's Information Minister, said similarly, ''There is no room for any compromise about Kuwait.'' 
The tough stance followed reports over the weekend that President Hussein might be prepared to show some flexibility on withdrawing from Kuwait. The softer line was delivered, as usual, through private diplomatic channels the week before, almost always to those to whom hints of compromise would be particularly welcome.
Last week, for example, Yevgeny M. Primakov, a member of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's Presidential Council, said after a meeting with Saddam Hussein in Baghdad that he was more optimistic about the chances for a peaceful resolution of the crisis.
While the Soviet Union has condemned Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and has endorsed all the United Nations Security Council resolution, Soviet officials have repeatedly said that they would send troops to the gulf only as part of a United Nations force. And on Monday, Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze took the further step of reassuring Parliament that the Kremlin would ask for legislative approval before committing Soviet forces.
 
Signals Through Jordan
President Hussein has sent similar conciliatory signals in recent weeks through King Hussein of Jordan, whose determination to do what he can to avert the use of military force has been reinforced by what he called the few ''positive signals'' he has received in written messages from the Iraqi leader.
As a result, King Hussein has pressed on with his attempts to devise an Arab solution to the crisis with the help of President Chadli Benjedid of Algeria and King Hassan II of Morocco. He has done so despite the fact that some of his closest advisers are skeptical about whether Iraq is ultimately willing to compromise.
King Hussein's statements, in interviews over the weekend, reflected the twin messages emanating from Baghdad. Based on discussions with and letters from President Hussein, the Jordanian ruler said, he felt that the Iraqi President was willing to leave most of Kuwait if some of his requirements were met. On the other hand, he emphasized, President Hussein was willing to fight rather than walk away from Kuwait with nothing.
The mixed signals have also served to enhance tension in the American-led alliance by driving a wedge of sorts between those countries who have sent soldiers to the Saudi desert and those who have refused, or been reluctant to do so.
 
Allies Who'd Rather Talk
''The Soviets and French are simply much more keen on letting the economic sanctions and diplomatic options run their full course than the British and the Americans,'' a diplomat here said. ''So Moscow and Paris have responded more enthusiastically and less skeptically to hints that a diplomatic settlement may be possible than Washington.''
Thus, the softer line serves Iraqi interests in that it forces those who are opposing Saddam Hussein's occupation of Iraq to check continuously with one another to see that both currents in this delicately balanced alliance continue to emphasize a determination to drive Iraq from Kuwait, but not appear insufficiently sensitive to pursuing chances for a diplomatic breakthrough.
Finally, Saddam Hussein, by setting up the possibility of a diplomatic and a military option for ending the confrontation, has left himself the greatest room for maneuvering.

DATELINE: SANTA CRUZ, Calif.

 BODY:
The downtown of this seaside city still resembles a war zone - empty lots surrounded by cyclone fences. Frustrated with the pace of recovery from the huge earthquake a year ago, townspeople compare what remains of the Pacific Garden Mall to downtown Beirut.
But local officials, developers and even some merchants say the physical ruins of the downtown area belie the progress they have made toward rebuilding it. Although only one new building is under construction, five more have been approved and others are expected to be approved soon. 
While they concede that recovery is taking longer than anticipated, they remain hopeful that several significant buildings will be completed and open for business in time for the 1991 Christmas season.
In Watsonville, a farming town 14 miles south of here, rebuilding of the downtown business district is also proceeding slowly; no buildings are under construction. But there the major concern is housing. With one in eight Watsonville homes destroyed by the quake, more than 80 low-income families are still living in trailers supplied by the Federal Government.
Downtown redevelopment projects typically take several years to complete, but Santa Cruz's historic antipathy to development of any kind means that the process here is even more difficult. For years officials went out of their way to restrict development along the Pacific Garden Mall, a tree-lined street of turn-of-the-century buildings that anchors downtown Santa Cruz.
 
Brief Ceremony Planned
''You have a city that proudly limited growth by slowing down the planning process, so there are no mechanisms in place to do things quickly,'' said Mark Primack, an architect and chairman of the Santa Cruz zoning board. ''Given how self-obstructive we were, we are doing O.K. The earthquake caught Santa Cruz sleeping, and that's part of the reason it's taking us so long to get things together.''
Santa Cruz has planned a brief ceremony today to mark the first anniversary of the earthquake, which registered 7.1 on the Richter scale last Oct. 17. The ceremony, to be held from 4:45 to 5:15 P.M., Pacific daylight time, will be at the Town Clock, at the north end of the mall. Mayor Mardi Wormhoudt is scheduled to speak, and at 5:04 P.M., the precise time the quake struck, all the church bells in Santa Cruz County will ring. Separately, a nondenominational service will be held in a tent that now houses the nearby Holy Cross Church.
Local residents say that they have grown accustomed to the holes where downtown used to be, and that somehow the area has again become a lively gathering place.
''The first few months were so depressing, a few people I know left the area simply because they couldn't stand to face the mall,'' said Gary Young, a poet and printer who lives in the hills north of here. ''Now, although they've done very little to fix the mall, more and more people are hanging out down there, leaning on the cyclone fences and talking, just as if there was still a downtown.''
 
The 'Phoenix Pavilions'
In the first few days after the quake, merchants, property owners and civic leaders mobilized to keep the downtown alive. They relocated 45 shops to a row of huge tents that they dubbed the ''Phoenix Pavilions.'' A public-private redevelopment foundation, Vision Santa Cruz, was formed to help reach a consensus on the mall's future.
''It has been tricky to find the balance between holding people off to spend two years planning the perfect town and just approving everything that's come in,'' Mayor Wormhoudt said, adding that people's expectations of a rebuilt downtown in one year were simply unrealistic.
An outpouring of community support created a record-breaking Christmas season for many of the businesses in the Pavilions last year, but there have been long dry spells since. This year some businesses' sales are up, while others are down. Given the downturn in the nation's economy, few merchants here are sanguine about the coming season. And many are skeptical about the pace of the rebuilding.
''It's definitely taking longer than it needs to,'' said Mark Sanchez, co-owner of Kelly's French Pastry, which has been able to move back into its permanent home at the north end of the mall. ''There are so many meetings about how the town should be and what kind of businesses should be allowed to come in - as if we had any choice.''
 
Six-Screen Theater Planned
Still, the apparent paralysis has not frightened away developers. A six-screen theater built above retail shops is to be constructed on the site of an old department store, and a combination retail and office building is to be built behind the facade of the demolished County Bank Building.
At the same corner, the Jay Paul Company, a developer based in neighboring Scotts Valley, is planning a $12 million project on the site of the Cooperhouse, a former county courthouse converted to shops and restaurants. The company bought the building for $1.7 million in 1988 and spent $1.2 million more refurbishing it, only to lose it to the wrecking ball when it was deemed unsafe after the earthquake.
Leonard McVicar, president of Jay Paul, remains optimistic about downtown Santa Cruz but concedes that getting financing is difficult. ''Going to the bank to get money is not the easiest thing in the world right now,'' he said. ''We couldn't have done our building and gotten funding without the city's commitment to rebuild downtown.''
But significant obstacles remain. Besides rebuilding the commercial buildings downtown, Santa Cruz must also rebuild the area's infrastructure, including water and sewer systems dating to the turn of the century.
''The handicap in Santa Cruz is the financial resources,'' said Ceil Cirillo, executive director of the city's redevelopment agency. ''I've never been in a community where the resources are so strapped.''
Ms. Cirillo is counting on voter approval of a 1/2-cent sales tax on the November ballot. Without it, she said, redevelopment will be significantly hampered.
 
Thousands Left Homeless
While only a few of the buildings proposed to replace the 25 destroyed in downtown Santa Cruz contain housing, many of the new retail buildings planned for Watsonville include apartments on their upper floors. Even before the earthquake, Watsonville had a vacancy rate of less than 1 percent; the quake left thousands of people, many of them poor farm workers, homeless. Some are now living in trailers; others are in motel rooms paid for by the Red Cross.
Charleen Shaffer, executive director of the Watsonville Chamber of Commerce, said she hopes that new downtown housing will help generate traffic and customers for retailers. Changing demographics had hurt the downtown merchants, she said, as many of Watsonville's newer and more affluent residents patronized a shopping center at the western edge of the city or went elsewhere.
Watsonville's downtown, like Santa Cruz's, is marked by holes where buildings once stood. Indeed, throughout the county there are signs that, while the quake lasted just 15 seconds, its impact will be felt for years.
''We're still in the middle of this crisis,'' said Ms. Wormhoudt, the Santa Cruz Mayor. ''We're not past that. ''It's neither wonderful or dire. It's going to be O.K. It's just hard right now.''

HEADLINE: Kansas Journal;
Russians and Americans Bury an Era

BYLINE: By WILLIAM ROBBINS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LAWRENCE, Kan., Oct. 16

 BODY:
The Russians are conquering the hearts of people in America's heartland, if the warm receptions given so far to a Soviet delegation here for a weeklong series of conferences with American citizens are any indication.
In the spirit of harmony that has prevailed here, the son of Nikita S. Khrushchev, the Soviet leader who caused a stir in this country when he declared, ''We will bury you,'' buried once and for all his father's threat.
''He proved to be wrong, in the sense that socialism would triumph over capitalism,'' acknowledged the son, Sergei Khrushchev, who is part of the 290-member Soviet delegation.
The son made the observation at a convocation here Monday after a weekend of Middle American hospitality. The Russian visitors were feted at a football game, a midnight basketball practice and a Soviet-American art show, were entertained in nearly 150 Kansas homes and joined a circle of Indian dancers at a gala at the University of Kansas. 
Privately, Sergei Khrushchev said through an interpreter that his father continued, until his death in 1971, to believe firmly that Russian socialism was the better political system.
When organizers first began to plan these sessions more than two years ago, they envisioned them as a way to further the cause of peace between the East and the West. But world events have raced far ahead of anything they thought possible.
Now, the ''people to people'' meetings and satellite conferences being held here and in other Kansas cities are focusing on issues like market economies, science, the environment, trade and ways to increase contacts between citizens of the two countries. The meetings and workshops will continue through Thursday.
Nowhere was the change in the world mood better illustrated than at the opening assembly on Monday. It was at the session that Americans and Soviet visitors learned that the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. The response was an instant of stunned silence and then a deafening burst of applause from both Kansans and guests.
The announcement was made by Robert Ivanov, an official of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. Mr. Ivanov is co-chairman of the event along with Bob Swan, a Lawrence insurance agent who, associates say, has been pursuing the dream of a Soviet-American conference here for six years.
Mr. Ivanov noted in an interview that the sessions, titled ''Meeting for Peace,'' were being run on a shoestring. The organizers were helped by the hospitality of Kansans, who agreed to take in Russians as guests in their homes, and by the Soviet Peace Committee, a nominally nongovernment Soviet group that raised funds for the air transportation.
The visitors include business and trade officials and groups of specialists in agriculture, the environment, government, international relations, communications, education and health, as well as many interpreters.
That camaraderie had survived a weekend of guest-and-host relationships and language difficulties was evident from smiling faces and comments from many of the visitors, including two daughters of the late Marshal Georgi K. Zhukov, a wartime friend of Dwight D. Eisenhower.
The daughters, Era and Ella Zhukova, had just accompanied other visitors to Abilene, Kan., for the centennial celebration of President Eisenhower's birth. There they presented to the Eisenhower Library nine photographs their family had saved of a meeting between General Eisenhower and Marshal Zhukov at the end of World War II.
''I like Kansas,'' Era Zhukova said. ''It's a quieter here.'' In similar vein, Viktor Vavilov, a television news producer from Penza, a Soviet city of about 500,000 people, told of being enthralled by the warmth of his reception here but not surprised. ''I come,'' he said, ''from the heart of Russia to the heart of America.''
In the spirit of the occasion, The Lawrence Daily Journal-World has been offering front-page coverage of the conference, as well as a daily column of domestic news from the Soviet Union, provided by Tass, the Soviet press agency.
''I thought it would be a good idea to give them some news from home,'' said Dolph C. Simons Jr., the editor and publisher. ''And our people here might enjoy reading it, too.''

HEADLINE: 'Baby Boomers' Donate More, a Survey Says

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN TELTSCH

 BODY:
Americans in the 25-to 44-year age group have substantially increased their contributions of money and volunteer time to charities, belying the popular perception that they are an ego-centered generation, a new survey shows.
Giving by all age groups last year totaled $96.4 billion. The most striking trend was the increase in gifts from Americans born since the mid-40's. The number of individuals within this group who gave increased, and those who made donations gave more. In addition, the survey said, the rate of increase of the 25-to-44 group exceeded that of other age groups. The group's financial contributions rose to 43 percent of all charitable donations last year, from 39 percent in 1987. The same age group provided 46 percent of all contributed volunteer time in 1987 and 55 percent in 1989. The age group makes up about 45 percent of the adult population. 
''The dramatic increase in charitable behavior by these baby boomers is particularly encouraging because the sheer size and youth of this group likely forecasts two generations of continuing growth in giving,'' said Brian O'Connell, president of the Independent Sector, the country's largest philanthropic coalition, with 750 foundations, companies and nonprofit organizations.
The coalition commissioned the survey by the Gallup Organization, which interviewed 2,727 adults in their homes from March 27 to May 20. The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
 
Previously a Poor Showing
Previous surveys reported disappointing response in giving and volunteering by 25-to-44 age group, said Virginia A. Hodgkinson, vice president of the Independent Sector, who has led its research programs.
She said: ''The behavioral patterns we are seeing now reflect a number of influences on this population group: Young adults in their child-bearing years tend to become more altruistic. This group is more highly educated than preceding generations. They are at the peak of their earning careers. They are more concerned about values. They were in the vanguard of the peace movement in the 60's. These influences add up to more charitable giving and more volunteering for community service.
''If these encouraging trends continue, we truly can predict a renaissance of philanthropy in America,'' Ms. Hodgkinson added.
The survey, called ''Giving and Volunteering in the United States,'' reported that more than 98 million Americans, an increase of 23 percent since 1987, volunteered their time last year to help charitable oranizations, and 75 percent of all households made financial contributions.
But the survey also found a shift in giving to youth programs and to health and human services, a change to programs that suffered the deepest Federal budget cuts, Ms. Hodgkinson added.
 
Giving by Wealthy
Giving and volunteering among blacks continued to increase markedly, a trend reported in earlier surveys. Sixty-one percent contributed money last year - up from 51 percent in 1987 - and volunteering also increased to 38 percent, from 28 percent.
Even though giving among the wealthy has increased, Mr. O'Connell said, most of America's affluent families are not generous: Ninety-five percent of households with incomes exceeding $1 million yearly averaged only $16,000 in charitable gifts. The remaining 5 percent in the same class averaged $125,000 annually, he said.
''In comparison to the proportion of giving by lower-income families with little disposable income, most wealthy Americans have to be characterized as stingy,'' he added.
In 1989, households with incomes under $10,000 gave an avergae of 5.5 percent of their income to charity.
Last year $54.3 billion, or 47.4 percent of all charitable contributions went to religious organizations, according to Giving USA, the annual report of the Trust for Philanthropy of the American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel.

HEADLINE: Dukakis Still Buoyant Despite Tough Times

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, Oct. 16

 BODY:
This has not been a good year for Gov. Michael S. Dukakis.
With Massachusetts in recession and the State Legislature paralyzed over a prolonged budget crisis, the man who only two years ago was the Democratic nominee for President has had to watch as his popularity rating has plummeted to below 20 percent.
In last month's primary election, virtually every candidate for statewide office who had any connection to him was trounced. And Mr. Dukakis's wife, Kitty, has written a best seller candidly describing her addiction to pills and alcohol, saying his actions fed into her addiction. 
But Mr. Dukakis retains an uncanny equilibrium, a detachment, even a sense of optimism, that friends praise as strength and critics deride as a lack of feeling. In an interview in his office in the gold-domed Statehouse on Beacon Hill, Mr. Dukakis said he does not feel personally rejected by the people of Massachusetts.
''People are angry generally across the country,'' he said, wearing a familiar button-down shirt, his hair a little grayer than during the Presidential campaign.
 
'Camelot All Over Again'
He acknowledged that voters in Massachusetts are particularly bitter. ''What happened here was, we were on a tremendous high,'' he said. ''The Governor of the state was running for President. Everybody knew I was a long shot, including yours truly, and lo and behold, it gets better and better, and suddenly he's won the nomination. It's Camelot all over again. ''And then we crashed. Kaboom. We did a lousy job in the general election. I've got to take responsibility for that.'' At the same time, he said, the state's economy, which he had been trumpeting as ''the Massachusetts miracle'', began turning sour. With that, Mr. Dukakis said, ''You've got the makings of a lot of anger and a lot of frustration.''
He added, ''People said, 'He kind of let us down in the campaign, and now he's back here and the thing isn't working.' ''
Asked how his wife's addiction and now the publication of her memoir had affected him, Mr. Dukakis answered eliptically, as he often does. ''I love her more today than I did the day I married her,'' he said.
''I'm married to an extraordinary woman,'' he added. ''She has dealt in a remarkably courageous way with a difficult personal problem.''
 
Accompanying Wife to Therapy
In her book, ''Now You Know'' (Simon & Schuster), Mrs. Dukakis says that in the weeks after her husband's defeat by George Bush, she began drinking so heavily that she sometimes passed out in the mornings in their bedroom, leading to calls to the Governor's office that brought Mr. Dukakis home to find her lying in vomit. Later, he would drive her to clinics for treatment, or accompany her to therapy sessions.
Mr. Dukakis rejects the suggestion that his wife's troubles interfered with his work, compounding the difficulty of ending the state's budget mess. ''Of course, you're concerned by it, you carry it with you,'' he said. But his 10 years of experience as Governor, he added, enabled him to get through his job.
 
Anger for Bush and Reagan
When Mr. Dukakis does display some emotion, some anger, it is saved for Ronald Reagan and President Bush. ''Bush is paying the price for 'Read My Lips,' '' he said, refering to Mr. Bush's campaign slogan promising no new taxes that was used so effectively against Mr. Dukakis. ''And we're all paying the price for Ronald Reagan.''
As a Presidential candidate, the thing Mr. Bush did that Mr. Dukakis found ''the most outrageous'' was to promise he would never raise taxes. ''That's a commitment no chief executive can keep,'' Mr. Dukakis said, ''He knew that.''
Part of being elected to office, Mr. Dukakis said, is ''you've got to be prepared to do things that are unpopular.'' Mr. Dukakis noted that he himself has cut $1.4 billion out of Massachusetts's $13 billion budget in the past 14 months. For Mr. Bush to do the equivalent in Washington, Mr. Dukakis said, he would have had to cut the Federal budget by more than $100 billion.
Mr. Dukakis indicated he is not holding a grudge against another candidate who ran a campaign against him, John R. Silber. Mr. Silber, the president of Boston University, won the Democratic nomination for governor last month with icy attacks on Mr. Dukakis's stewardship.
Mr. Dukakis said he would nonetheless vote for Mr. Silber in November because the candidate is oppposed to a popular ballot initiative that would drastically cut state taxes and fees, forcing the state to cut the $13 billion budget by an estimated $1 billion in the first six months of next year and by another $2 billion the following year.
 
'Silber Is Absolutely Right'
''On that fundamental issue, our friend Mr. Silber, whatever one thinks of his peccadillos, is absolutely right,'' Mr. Dukakis said. Mr. Silber's Republican opponent, William F. Weld, a former United States Attorney, supports the tax-cutting measure.
Mr. Dukakis also insists he is optimistic about Massachusetts' future. He spends much of his time traveling the state, spreading the gospel of salvation through high tech, the source of much of the Massachusetts boom of the 1980's.
Mr. Dukakis will not comment on what his plans are after he leaves office in January. One report says he and his wife will accept teaching positions at the University of Hawaii, at least temporarily.
He admits no self-pity. ''We are all volunteers in this business,'' Mr. Dukakis said. Nobody asked us to do this job. Through good times and bad I've loved public service.''
But Mr. Dukakis does have one wish. ''I would have loved to be President of the United States,'' he said. ''I'm sorry I'm not.''

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET BATTLE;
Plan Would Revise Farm Subsidies

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 16

 BODY:
House and Senate conferees reached agreement today on a $41 billion, five-year farm policy that changes the structure of commodity price supports and includes the strongest environmental provisions of any farm legislation in history.
The changes in rules that have provided subsidies to producers of grain, cotton, rice and other commodities for more than five decades are intended to save the Government $13.6 billion over the next five fiscal years.
The conferees estimated that, at $41 billion, farm program spending from fiscal 1991 through fiscal 1995 would cost slightly more each year than the $7.8 billion that was spent in fiscal 1990. Before the agreed changes, conferees estimated that the five-year cost of the bill would be $54 billion to $56 billion. 
 
New Course for Agriculture
Over the long-term, experts in both parties said, the broad package of economic, scientific and environmental provisions agreed to today is intended to set a new course for American agriculture, making the farm sector less costly to the Government and less threatening to the environment.
The agreement on programs to protect the environment come after both committees for decades rejected the notion that farm chemicals needed to be closely regulated to reduce contamination.
Edward Madigan, Republican of Illinois and the ranking minority member of the House Agriculture Committee, said today that the provisions had been adopted by the House committee to head off even more stringent regulations that were being proposed.
The legislation is expected to be considered and approved later this week or early next week by both houses of Congress and signed by President Bush. ''It is a respectable work product that balances well inumerable sensitive, often divergent, interests,'' Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said today.
The most significant change was introduced late last week to respond to the demand by Congressional leaders that farm program spending be cut by more than 25 percent to reduce the Federal deficit. The conferees said they met the demand by agreeing to change the structure of the price support programs.
 
Decades of Control
Since the program was established in the 1930's, the supply of grain, cotton, rice and other commodities has been controlled by the Government through contracts with hundreds of thousands of farmers.
In exchange for letting a specified amount of land lay fallow each year, typically 5 percent to 15 percent of their tillable land, farmers who signed up for the program are paid for every bushel of grain, bale of cotton or pound of rice they produce. Under the new bill, the amount of land on which farmers can grow crops eligible for payments would be reduced by 15 percent.
The conferees also agreed to set a limit of $100,000 on payments to any farmer.
According to an analysis by an economist at Oklahoma State University, a farmer who has a 1,000-acre wheat farm in Kansas could lose nearly $13,000 as a result of the change.
The reduction in the amount of a farmer's harvest that is eligible for Government support, together with the $100,000 limit on payments, opens the commodity price support programs more than ever before to market forces.
 
Some Might Drop Out
Experts in both parties said today that under the proposed new program, farmers might be eligible in some years to grow crops that receive Government payments on just 70 percent of their land. If market prices are high enough, thousands might drop out of the program, they said. If farmers abandoned the program, Congressional support could diminish and lead to more substantial structural changes, even elimination of the programs as early as 1995.
''You have a farm bill where farmers now can make a real choice about whether to farm on the program or off,'' said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Democrat of Vermont and chairman of the conference committee. ''In the past, you really didn't have a choice. The programs were the only game in town.''
Several conferees said that they were anxious about the rule changes and that they might vote against the final bill. ''It will cause in the short-term a reduction in net farm incomes at a time when costs are up. It's going to squeeze cash,'' said Senator Bob Kerrey, a Democrat of Nebraska. ''It's going to have a negative impact and it's apt to be felt the worst in the Great Plains because it's drier and farmers don't have the same options'' as farmers in other parts of the country.
Several farm groups said today they were very unhappy with the proposed reduction in harvests that are eligible for payments. They also criticized fees that producers of milk, sugar, tobacco, peanuts, honey and wool are expected to pay when they market their crops in a new plan expected to raise $1 billion or more.
''Congress has gone tax crazy,'' said Wayne Cryts, a spokesman in Missouri for the American Agriculture Movement, one of the nation's largest farm groups. ''It is our opinion that we have enough tax writing committees in Washington, but it appears now that we have two more in the Senate and House Ag committees.''
 
New Enrivonmental Provisions
The 1990 farm policy law also contains an array of new provisions that the conferees believe will make farming less polluting and result in safer food for consumers.
Perhaps the most significant is a ten-fold increase in the amount of money that Congress wants the Department of Agriculture to spend on research into cultivation practices that use little or no toxic chemicals. The department spent $5 million in fiscal 1990 to develop such practices; the conferees authorized the department to spend $80 million a year.
The conferees also established rules that require farmers to keep records on how they use 125 toxic pesticides. The records could be reviewed by the department for studies on pesticide use across the United States and must be made available for review by medical specialists in the investigation of poisoning accidents.
One provision sought by environmental groups to bar the export of pesticides outlawed for use in the United States was dropped from the bill after the White House, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Agriculture agreed with the pesticide industry that it was unnecessary and would cost hundreds of jobs.

On the private balcony that adjoins his office and commands a sweeping view of Washington's monuments, Bob Dole is squinting into the autumn sun and plotting a budget strategy to save face for George Bush's White House.
It is a twist of fate that escapes no one who has watched the leader of the Senate's 45-member Republican minority operate on Capitol Hill in the two years since Mr. Bush trounced him in the New Hampshire Presidential primary, all but ending his hopes for a chance at the White House.
''Senator Straddle,'' Mr. Bush called Mr. Dole then, for refusing to sign a no-tax pledge. Whatever pleasure Mr. Dole may take in seeing the President awkwardly straddle the tax issue now, it is private. A politician who is fiercely proud of being a pro, he gives careful, correct responses to questions about his relation to the former rival he once scorned as a lightweight. 
 
No Time for Dancing
''I get people who say, 'You ought to call the President,' '' Mr. Dole said in an interview this week. '' 'You know, call him up and talk to him.' I say, 'I called Ronald Reagan three times in eight years.' I don't bother them. I figure they're busy, we're busy. We meet.''
The closest he would come to criticizing Mr. Bush's seeming changes of mind and direction on taxes was in his account of the advice he gave the White House on Monday. ''I did say we ought to know in advance where we want to come out,'' Mr. Dole said. ''I mean it ought to be clear. We ought to let everybody know in advance, including the Democrats. We don't have time anymore to dance around the bottom line for three or four weeks.''
The Senator is not often so direct. One reads him between the lines, in the famous quips and barbs that serve him as both weapon and shield. They hide the emotions of a complex man, capping the well of raw anger that flashed across across national televison two years ago, when in an interview after Mr. Bush's New Hampshire primary victory, the Vice President wished him well in the contest ahead.
Eyes blazing, the Senator replied, ''Stop lying about my record.''
''Outrage,'' he says now. ''You have to watch that sometimes.''
 
An Arrow for Gingrich
His penchant for political trench-fighting serves him better as a legislative leader than it did as a national candidate in both 1988 and 1976, when he was Gerald R. Ford's running mate. But his job in the next few days is also that of conciliator: to repair weeks of miscalculations and ham-handed negotiating by Mr. Bush and his top advisers; to keep the Democrats from tagging the Republicans as champions of the rich; to try to salvage the framework of a budget compromise that he and his friend Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who heads the Senate Finance Committee, have worked out with Senate Democratic leaders.
''Some of my colleagues say: 'Why are you up there doing this? You ought to be out there with us: No new taxes,' '' Mr. Dole said. ''But I'm the leader; I'm the Republican leader. I'm not Newt Dole, you know.'' That arrow is aimed at Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the House Republican whip, who led the rebellion two weeks ago that toppled the budget compromise between the White House and top Congressional leaders of both parties.
 
Next, the Hard Part
The Senate's new bipartisan plan, intended to divide the burden of new revenues equally between the wealthy and other taxpayers, will come to the floor on Wednesday or Thursday. Mr. Dole's first job is to make sure it passes. The hard part will come later, when the Senate plan must be reconciled in a conference committee with a rival Democratic measure approved in the House today.
''The test is going to be whether we still have the Democratic leadership in the House, or whether they are going to abandon us for Rosty,'' Mr. Dole said. The reference is to Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who heads the House Ways and Means Committee and who devised the Democratic plan to raise the rates of upper-income taxpayers while avoiding unpopular taxes on gasoline or deep cuts in the Medicare program.
Although Mr. Dole called the Democratic plan a blatant example of partisan grandstanding, he did not hide his admiration for Mr. Rostenkowski's political gamesmanship. ''He's got a great staff,'' Mr. Dole said, ''but who knows how much he's put in there for mischief and how much he really means?''
 
'Hard-Bitten Conscience'
It is in such calculations that Bob Dole is in his element. The son of a cream and egg man in Russell, Kan., he thought about being a doctor. A near-fatal wound in World War II shattered his right arm and put that dream out of reach, but left him with a burning drive to prove he could make it. Instead of medicine, he turned to law and politics.
After a term in the Kansas House of Representatives in the early 1950's, he was elected to Congress in 1960 and the Senate in 1968; from 1971 to 1973 he served as Republican national chairman under Richard M. Nixon. During the Reagan years, he and his second wife, Elizabeth, now the Secretary of Labor, were known as Washington's ''power couple.''
Ask his acquaintances what his hobby is. They say politics. Many also say, as does Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, that he is ''a man of conscience, a certain hard-bitten conscience.''
He brandishes income tables, the newest tactical weapon in the battle over the budget. For months, Democrats have made effective use of them to brand Republicans as the party of the rich, turning fairness into a new litmus test of acceptability.
Sure, he says, the House Democratic plan would place a surtax on millionaires. But what about its proposed one-year delay in inflation adjustments for tax exemptions and tax brackets? ''A married couple with children and a taxable income of $34,000 would pay $313.50 more next year,'' he said triumphantly. ''That's a 6 percent tax increase.''
 
Taxes: The Tough Sell
The provisions of the tax code that index brackets and exemptions for inflation were Senator Dole's handiwork in 1981. A third of the tax increases in the new Senate package would fall on taxpayers of upper-middle and upper incomes, he says, noting that he made this point to the President. It's a tough sell, he agrees, not the sort of thing that wins points on television, and maybe not enough to persuade a majority of Senate Democrats and Republicans in the end.
''You have to give people some reason to vote for this,'' he continued. ''The real reason, deficit reduction, ought to be good enough, but they have to have something to take home and say, 'I won this.' For some that was a capital-gains tax cut; for the Democrats it was a rate hike.''
And it was the drive to win a capital-gains tax cut, he said, that cost the White House tactical leverage and political high ground. ''We hung on to that issue too long,'' he said; it was clear, at least to him and other Republican senators, that the Democrats would never permit a capital-gains tax cut on terms the White House could accept.
''I think I know the players here pretty well,'' he went on, ''and I think I know when when there's a genuine exchange, or when somebody's holding back something. And when somebody tells you, in effect, 'This is our bottom line . . .' '' His voice trailed off.
Conversation with Bob Dole is like that, lurching unpredictably from topic to topic, leaving his listeners to complete half-finished thoughts or sentences that end ''you know'' whether you do or not. Did he give other advice that the White House ignored?
''I just hate to get tagged with the fairness issue,'' he said, and called the White House preoccupation with a capital-gains tax cut a ''tar baby'' that needlessly stalled and dominated the budget negotiating. Never as wedded to the gains cut as Mr. Bush, he publicly proposed to separate it from the deficit-reduction plan a week before the White House dropped its insistence on it.
Privately, he had argued in vain that the Administration was losing sight of its original objective: a deficit-reduction measure that could pass both houses. ''There's always a tendency in the White House for people to believe that the members of Congress are a sort of fraternity up here,'' he said, ''and that if they're not pushing their point of view it's not going to be heard.''
That anonymous ''they'' was a reference to the White House chief of staff, John H. Sununu, who happens to have been the architect of Mr. Bush's campaign in New Hampshire, and to Richard G. Darman, the White House budget director. But before the point could be pressed, Mr. Dole broadened it to speak of Ronald Reagan's budget director, David A. Stockman, and to note that the syndrome may be universal.
Mr. Stockman would come to his office seeking spending cuts ''hundreds of times, push, push, push, trying to get one million more, or ten million, or a billion,'' said the consummate legislative politician, who added: ''So from that standpoint, I don't think it's much different. But there's got to be a time when you sort of let go, you know.''

HEADLINE: Fooling Around With Taxes

 BODY:
The House is on the verge of passing a $500 billion deficit reduction package. But it is hard to take the bill seriously. It includes amendments imposing stiff tax increases, aimed at the rich, that are unlikely to pass the Senate and that President Bush is sure to veto. 
The principle of taxing the rich more than the poor to pay for deficit reduction might be noble. But the amendments amount to demagogy. They would eliminate an increase in the gas tax, undermining energy conservation. They would postpone correction of the income tax code for inflation, leaving an invisible tax on the middle class. They would lower the capital gains tax for exactly the wrong kinds of investments.
The House plan was well designed to embarrass Republicans into voting against a package weighted in favor of the poor. The Republicans responded with some demagogy of their own, proposing a deficit reduction package that pretended to cut the deficit without raising taxes. Congress owes the country a responsible deficit reduction package. Three days before the deadline for closing down the Government again, the country is still waiting.
Last month's budget summit produced a plan to cut the deficit by $500 billion over five years. But it would have raised taxes on the poorest families three times as much as on the richest. That was the main reason the House rejected the package.
The alternative plan approved last week by the House Ways and Means Committee, similar to one before the Senate Finance Committee, would have increased taxes on gasoline, alcohol, cigarettes and several luxury items. It would also have reduced the total amount of deductions for rich families and expanded tax credits for the working poor. Roughly speaking, it would have affected most income groups proportionately.
The plan voted in the House yesterday drops the tax hike on gasoline and postpones for a year the indexing of tax rates and personal exemptions for inflation. That's a cynical way to hit the middle class with an invisible rather than a visible tax. And it would undo a boost for energy conservation.
The House plan would also raise the tax rate on the highest incomes to 33 percent from 28, and raise the tax on wealthy families that take advantage of enormous amounts of deductions and exemptions. But the Democrats surely know that Mr. Bush would veto any package that raised income taxes unless it also capitulated to his obsessive quest for a capital gains tax cut.
It is precisely on capital gains that the House plan reverberates with ignorance - or cynicism. It would allow individuals $100,000 of capital gains free of income tax over a lifetime - but only on the sale of real estate, farms, businesses and timber, not stocks. The tax code already heavily favors investments in real estate and timber. To direct more precious resources their way is shameless.
The budget clock is still ticking. Congress is still fooling around.

HEADLINE: Holes in the Fish Safety Net

 BODY:
While meat and poultry have long been subject to mandatory Federal inspection, there is no comparable program to protect the public from contaminated fish - despite a marked rise in fish consumption by consumers seeking to cut down on dietary fat. Legislation set for a vote today in the House would begin to close this gaping hole in the food safety net.
The risks are real. Fish and shellfish come from waters where sewage and toxic chemicals abound. Data from the Centers for Disease Control suggest that the chance of contracting an illness from fish is about 25 times greater than for beef, and about 16 times greater than for pork or poultry. It's estimated that 1 in 250 people who eat raw shellfish will become sick. Such fish poisoning can cause nausea, severe abdominal cramps, chest pains and, in severe cases, death. 
A big problem is inadequate inspection. The Food and Drug Administration, though technically in charge, has lagged in setting legal limits on fish contaminants. And it has monitored seafood processing plants sporadically, testing only a small percentage of the four billion pounds of fish consumed. Meanwhile, state-by-state regulation of shellfish beds is weak and inconsistent.
Industry, wary of losing consumer confidence, supports sensible legislation that would require the F.D.A. to set strong standards for chemical and microbiological contaminants. The legislation would also require the Department of Agriculture, which now inspects meat and poultry, to carry out stepped-up fish inspections and product samplings.
Consumer groups are split. Some would prefer that the F.D.A. run the entire program. Nevertheless, the legislation promises a reasonable measure of protection.
A bill sponsored by George Mitchell, the Senate majority leader, who represents fishing-dependent Maine, has already cleared the Senate. There's a similar version in the House, sponsored by Representative Kika de la Garza, Democrat of Texas, which adds strong protection for whistle-blowers. The House version deserves prompt support.

HEADLINE: IN THE NATION;
Cracking the Coalition

BYLINE: By Tom Wicker

 BODY:
The deaths of 21 Palestinians from Israeli police gunfire have made it clear that the U.S. could not keep Arab nations in its shaky Middle East military coalition if it launched a military offensive against Iraq and Saddam Hussein.
This is so whether you accept Israel's contention that the 21 deserved what they got, or the more general view that the police barrage was unjustified. Either way, the events on the Temple Mount raised the possibility of renewed Arab unity against Israel and the breakdown of the U.S. coalition against Iraq.
So serious was the threat considered by President Bush that his Administration introduced in the Security Council a U.S. resolution condemning Israel, and designed to make it possible for Arab nations like Egypt and Syria to remain in the coalition. That's as far as any U.S. Government has gone in chastising Israel, and defying its powerful U.S. supporters. 
Even so, the Palestine Liberation Organization and other Arabs unsuccessfully sought a stronger resolution against Israel, which did not ease the problem by its intransigent stand against even the U.S.-backed resolution. If Israel, as promised, rebuffs a U.N. investigating mission, the crisis could be rekindled.
Yet the shooting of Palestinians produced a relatively minor Arab reaction compared with what would follow a U.S. assault on Iraq. Arabs who have joined in a justified international effort to stop Iraq from invading Saudi Arabia will not take part in a military attack on another Arab nation and on a man many Arabs regard as a hero and leader.
''Egyptian forces in Saudi Arabia will not participate in any offensive,'' their commander, Gen. Mohammed Ali Bilal, has said. Syria's attitude is not so clear, and Hafez al-Assad no doubt would like to see the end of Mr. Hussein as a rival for Arab leadership; but he could hardly stand alone with the U.S. in an attack on Iraq when other Arab nations were holding back or aiding Mr. Hussein.
It's not even certain that most non-Arab allies would join the U.S. in a desert offensive against Iraq. Mrs. Thatcher, as if nostalgic for her Falkland Islands triumph, did make a warlike speech to the Conservative Party last week. But the U.S. would need more than British backing if it were to make war on Iraq under supposed international auspices. Is the Soviet Union likely to join the U.S. and Britain in an anti-Arab war?
Up to now, Mr. Bush has admirably succeeded in putting together, leading and maintaining a collective-security effort in the Mideast that has restored credibility to the concept. It would vitiate that success and dash the concept if, in the end, the U.S. were to act alone, or in concert only with the British, to assert a military settlement of a political crisis.
But what about Kuwait and Mr. Hussein's aggression? If belligerent talk from Washington and London were muted, a settlement that restored Kuwaiti independence - but not the Emirate - and gave Iraq access to the Persian Gulf might not be impossible. Mr. Bush would have to swallow a few tough words, but that's what makes a compromise.
Even if that could be arranged, hawkish Americans and Israelis point out that Mr. Hussein would be left with his army, his chemical weapons, his nuclear ambitions, his savage dictatorship and his aggressive intentions. How, they ask, can the U.S., paragon of peace and democracy, permit any such thing?
Two responses are in order. The first is that if Saddam Hussein remains in power after a Kuwaiti compromise, he might cause trouble in the future, even after the massive international rebuke to his first aggression. But then again, he might not; predicting what may happen in five years, or ten, is an uncertain art, not necessarily improved by experience. And preventive war is only aggression with good intentions.
Second, if collective security could shut off the possibility of an invasion of Saudi Arabia, and impose a punishing blockade and embargo on an offender nation, it's possible collective security could provide the Mideast and the world with needed future protection against Iraq. Peace-loving nations, of which the anti-Iraq coalition supposedly is composed, owe it to the world to take that approach.
Mr. Bush, unfortunately, has encouraged without explicitly stating the idea that war is the only alternative if economic sanctions don't cause Mr. Hussein to surrender. The President has suggested, for example, that ''Nuremberg trials'' await Iraqi leaders. But tough talk is cheap; war costs real lives.

HEADLINE: Regan Sees Large Rise In Budget Gap

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
Providing the first hard evidence of how severely the state's fiscal fortunes may be sliding, the State Comptroller, Edward V. Regan, announced yesterday that New York State ran up a budget gap of almost $250 million for the first half of the fiscal year.
Mr. Regan also predicted that the state could face a shortfall of between $2 billion and $3 billion for the next fiscal year, which begins on April 1. Last January, before the Persian Gulf crisis or the full impact of the national economic downturn could be predicted, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's budget division forecast that the gap would be $941 million.
''Given these unforeseen events, the state must now prepare for a downward slope in budget numbers - at the very least for far slower growth in the next six months than had been projected,'' Mr. Regan said in a statement. 
 
A Difficult Economic Future
For several months, Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Regan have been predicting that the state, like New York City, was facing a difficult economic future. But today's report from the Comptroller gave those dire warnings a statistical edge and added to the fears that the next round of state budget negotiations could be even more painful than the last.
The Governor and Legislature approved a budget last spring that set records for lateness and for new taxes, which amounted to $1.8 billion. In the middle of the budget talks, the state's credit rating was dropped to its lowest level in history.
Mr. Cuomo, who is seeking re-election on Nov. 6, has taken the unconventional political step of sounding a loud siren about the state's fiscal condition before Election Day. He declared late last week that New York was in a ''mild recession'' and he argues in his latest campaign commercials that the state needs his experience to manage tough fiscal times that lie ahead. The Governor did not dispute Mr. Regan's numbers yesterday, but said he would await a report from his budget director at the end of this month before deciding if the state must take measures to erase a deficit. If the deficit is real, he said he would push for a plan that relies solely on spending cuts rather than tax increases and short-term borrowing.
The $246 million budget gap for the first half of the current year has been created by a plummeting downturn in tax collections that has not been offset by a spending slowdown ordered by Mr. Cuomo. A budget gap is a projected shortage of state funds created when either revenues are lower than anticipated or spending is higher than expected or both.
Tax revenues fell about $200 million below expectations during the first six months of the fiscal year, largely because of a $178 million shortfall in collections of the personal income tax, according to Marvin G. Nailor, a spokesman for Mr. Regan. Sales taxes also declined, while business tax collections were up, Mr. Nailor said.
Perhaps the most foreboding aspect of Mr. Regan's report is that the budget gap appeared only in August and September, an indication that the economy may be slipping quickly. A report he released in mid-August showed that the state budget had a $6.5 million surplus as of July 31.
Mr. Regan and Mr. Cuomo declined to estimate yesterday how wide the budget gap might be by the end of the fiscal year. But Carl Carlucci, who as secretary to the Assembly Ways and Means Committee is a top financial adviser to the Assembly Speaker, Mel Miller, said he ''would not be surprised'' if the number reaches $1 billion.
 
Speed Would Be Essential
Mr. Regan and Mr. Cuomo both said yesterday that speed would be of the essence in reducing a deficit. Mr. Cuomo, who appeared at a forum on state fiscal reform at New York University, said he would ask the Legislature to return to Albany ''immediately'' if he concludes there is a deficit.
The Legislature has tentative plans to convene a special session in December to consider a new capital plan for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, but Mr. Cuomo's comment raised the possibility that the lawmakers might have to return earlier.
''The best thing to do is to start sooner rather than later,'' said Cynthia Green, an analyst with the Citizens Budget Commission, a watchdog group financed by businesses. ''Once you get into the 10th, 11th, 12th months, it's very hard to realize any substantial savings.''
Mr. Cuomo said he would try to reduce a deficit without a tax increase.
 
'Do It Without Taxes'
''We will plan to do it without taxes,'' he said.
But he refused to take an absolute no-tax pledge. ''President Bush had a no new taxes pledge,'' he said, referring to the campaign promise that Mr. Bush broke this year. ''That's why I don't have one. I don't want to get into the box that the President found himself in.''
While Mr. Cuomo came close to ruling out new taxes as a solution to any deficit, at least one legislative leader was reluctant to do so.
''That's nice,'' said Mr. Miller, when told of Mr. Cuomo's comments on taxes. ''Is it feasible? It depends on how far down you go.
 
'Do It on the Spending Side'
''Two hundred and forty-six million dollars is not an overwhelming sum in a $33 billion general fund budget. It's not even 1 percent. If the shortfall is on that level then I think you can do it on the spending side. The question is how much more deterioration is there going to be by the end of the fiscal year.''
Although state officials were reluctant to quantify the potential budget gap, they were not optimistic.
Mr. Cuomo's budget director, Dall Forsythe, who is not prone to hyperbole about fiscal matters, said flatly today, ''We expect it to get worse.''
And Mr. Miller said there was a very good reason to solve this year's deficit early, unlike last year when the state had to borrow $775 million to cover its budget gap. ''I think every attempt is going to be made to finish the year in balance because I don't think next year is going to be any better,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Rinfret's No. 2 Hopes for Nibble from Voters

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK

DATELINE: SODUS POINT, N.Y., Oct. 14

 BODY:
Some politicians give out campaign buttons or bumper stickers when they take to the hustings. George F. T. (Geff) Yancey Jr. hands out cheese.
He talks about it as well. In most campaign appearances, before he talks about taxes or the death penalty or Pierre A. Rinfret, whom he hopes to serve as lieutenant governor, he talks about cheese. 
''Has anybody here ever eaten Heluva Good Cheese?'' he asked a cheering crowd at a Republican unity rally in Albany the other day as he stepped to the microphone to introduce Mr. Rinfret. Campaign workers passed out cheese sticks. Mr. Rinfret spoke. ''Great cheese, isn't it?'' Mr. Yancey said before introducing the next speaker.
The 44-year-old Mr. Yancey makes the cheese, $36 million of it a year, in this small town on the Lake Ontario shore. He says the cheese, with blue ''Yancey/Rinfret'' stickers on the package, is simply a device, a trademark if you will, to attract attention to a low-budget campaign for the state's No. 2 job. He laughs off suggestions that he is looking for free publicity for his cheese, or that he would rather talk about cheese than about Mr. Rinfret, who has conducted an erratic campaign.
''A heckuva lot more people know the name Heluva Good Cheese than the name Geff Yancey,'' he explained in an interview here at the cheese company, which markets cheese and cheese spread in supermarkets across New York and 16 other states.
''It's all in fun,'' continued the buoyant, mustachioed Mr. Yancey, the president of Heluva Good Cheese Inc. and a father of two and grandfather of two. ''Talking about it simply leads me into the real message of this campaign, which is that Mario Cuomo has been a disaster for this state.''
Whether the cheese is advertising the man or the man is advertising the cheese, Mr. Yancey is on a grueling promotion schedule these days: 31,000 miles so far, in 52 of the state's 62 counties.
But many voters in the New York metropolitan region have yet to see much of Mr. Yancey - among the counties he has not visited are Brooklyn and Queens - because his campaign is concentrated upstate, where party leaders hope he will galvanize Republican voters to come out for him and Mr. Rinfret on Nov. 6.
In some ways, swaying these crowds is not exactly an uphill battle. Although he is officially running against incumbent Lieut. Gov. Stan Lundine, he reserves most of his venom for Governor Cuomo, blaming him for rising taxes and what he considers too lenient treatment of criminals.
Just before Mr. Yancey was introduced at the annual meeting of the Wayne County Women's Republican Club here on Saturday afternoon, at the Sodus Bay Heights Golf Club, the speaker offered this invocation:
 
Mario Cuomo is my shepherd, I shall not want;
He leadeth me beside the still factories;
He restoreth my doubt in New York politics;
He guideth me to the path of unemployment;
He anointeth my wage with freeze.
Nevertheless, even if the Governor is vilified in some of the precincts where Mr. Yancey campaigns, the candidate must also generate enough enthusiasm for Mr. Rinfret so that Republican voters will not boycott the polls, or defect to other contenders like Herb London, the Conservative Party candidate, or Louis P. Wein, the nominee of the Right to Life Party.
Unlike the campaign of Mr. Rinfret, Mr. Yancey's bid for office has not been marked by bluster or condemnation of his fellow Republican leaders. And with the exception of vigorous attacks on Mr. Cuomo's record on crime and the economy, Mr. Yancey has conducted an upbeat campaign. Some party leaders have even privately wondered whether a ticket topped by the articulate and relentlessly enthusiastic Mr. Yancey might have worked out better than the one headed by Mr. Rinfret.
 
Holes in Big Cheese Jokes
At the height of Mr. Rinfret's quarrels with Republican leaders, now said to be smoothed over, one county chairman said Mr. Rinfret was ''out of control'' while another said he needed to get some bed rest. Mr. Yancey, however, has shown fealty all along.
He described Mr. Rinfret in glowing terms as a ''nonpolitician,'' and says that some of his more unconventional ideas, like putting armed vigilantes on the streets of New York City, simply reflect the way that good businessmen tend to consider ''a ton of ideas,'' not all of them practical.
''It's kind of a no-holds-barred strategy,'' said Mr. Yancey. ''The approach is: just give us any ideas you can, and we'll sort 'em all out later.''
Asked by a reporter whether Mr. Rinfret would make a great governor, Mr. Yancey whistled softly through his teeth and said after a moment, ''I think he would give us solutions to problems that have never been solved before.''
Mr. Yancey has not run for public office since being elected student body president at North Rose High School, although he has served as the Republican Party chairman of Wayne County and is active in a dizzying variety of local committees and charities in this county about halfway between Syracuse and Rochester. On the day this year's Republican convention in Rye ended, he was drafted to run for lieutenant governor by exhausted party leaders who had spent weeks trying to find someone to take the gubernatorial nomination.
Since then he has endured innumerable jokes about trying to be a big cheese in New York politics. Many local reporters have speculated that if he does not become lieutenant governor, he may have his eye on another position: a seat in Congress.
For now, however, Mr. Yancey says he is ''having a ball'' in the campaign, talking up conservative policies and talking down Mario Cuomo.
Once the voters know who he is, Mr. Yancey says, he'll be seen as a viable choice. ''Having Heluva Good Cheese behind me in this campaign is very important,'' he told the Republican Women's group here. ''In fact,'' he added, ''I've been thinking of changing my name. From now on, no more Geff Yancey. Just call me Heluva Good Yancey.'' Wessanen, U.S.A.d(Heluva Good Cheese)

HEADLINE: Can a Mall at a Toxic Dump Revive an Ailing Syracuse?

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

DATELINE: SYRACUSE

 BODY:
Just moments from the heart of downtown oozes Oil City, an industrial wasteland of oil tanks, junkyards, toxic dumps and corroded buildings hugging the shore of Onondaga Lake, itself a hazardous waste site.
For decades Oil City has stood as a kind of monument to 20th-century environmental arrogance, its future written off by government and business alike. ''It was a joke,'' said the city's development director, Joe C. Mareane.
But now, despite daunting environmental and economic hurdles, city officials and developers - in particular the Pyramid Companies, the mall-development giant based here - have joined to remake the 800-acre eyesore into what they hope will be the city's salvation.
They envision a thriving waterfront in the spirit of Baltimore's reborn harbor, ringed with parks, condominiums, canals and offices that could reverse a 30-year exodus that has sent the city's population to 165,000, from 225,000. 
The linchpin of this vision is Pyramid's first project in its hometown, the new Carousel Center, a mall to end all malls atop a former hazardous-waste site. With 1.4 million square feet of retail space on seven levels and an atrium soaring the equivalent of 17 stories, the mall will introduce Syracuse to such upscale outlets as Bonwit Teller, Ann Taylor, Banana Republic and Williams-Sonoma. But despite the great hopes for rebirth, there is concern whether the rest of Oil City - about 600 acres - will be revived. And with the Northeast shrouded in deepening economic gloom, there is skepticism that even the mall can succeed.
''I hate to sound like a doubting Thomas, but the mall could be a big souffle,'' said Susan Monagle, the owner of a downtown clothing boutique, TDF. ''It's going to be wonderful and the stores will knock our socks off, but there aren't enough people with enough money to support it.''
 
Rashes and Breathing Problems
The source of much of the skepticism over the rest of Oil City is Pyramid's troubles at the 75-acre mall site, on Hiawatha Boulevard overlooking Onondaga Lake. With the State Department of Environmental Conservation's approval, Pyramid volunteered to clean up 1.5 acres that were contaminated with solvents.
The cleanup cost the company $15 million - $13 million more than expected. Several construction workers on the part of the property not listed as a hazardous-waste site, the former Marley junkyard, were treated for skin rashes and breathing problems.
The Department of Environmental Conservation fined Pyramid $55,000 for allowing eight pounds of solvents to seep into a barge canal. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined a Pyramid subsidiary and consultant a total of $4,920 for violations, including failure to provide training and washing areas for workers.
In addition, Ward B. Stone, a Conservation Department wildlife pathologist nicknamed the ''toxic avenger'' for frequently contradicting the agency's official position, rode into Syracuse and took his own tests. He said he found a contaminated pocket on the Marley site with PCB's at four times the state's hazardous level of 50 parts per million.
The agency's local engineers had declared the Marley site safe, and they repeated that assessment after Mr. Stone left town and they were unable to replicate his findings. But the infighting among state environmentalists caused a stir in the local media and infuriated Pyramid officials.
When Pyramid proposed the Oil City redevelopment three years ago, it committed itself only to the two projects it saw as catalysts, Carousel Mall and Franklin Square, another part of Oil City whose decaying brick warehouses have been converted into condominiums and offices connected by brick walks, Victorian-style lampposts, benches and a park with a $35,000 bronze statue of Benjamin Franklin. But it was assumed that the company would do more. Now Pyramid says it will only promote Oil City's development, primarily because of the environmental problems.
''I fear our history will deter other developers, but the promise of Oil City is still there,'' said Bruce A. Kenan, a Pyramid partner in charge of the Lakefront Redevelopment, as Oil City's renewal is called.
Other factors could also leave the rest of Oil City fallow.
The city government now faces two uphill struggles. The first is the condemnation of 80 acres, dotted with 67 oil storage tanks and owned by nine oil companies. Although Pyramid has created a new oil tank farm for their relocation six miles away in the town of Van Buren, several oil companies want to stay put, and legal battles loom.
 
A New Federal Regulation
The second is the acquisition of the barge canal from the State Department of Transportation, so that a harbor can be developed with promenades and boat slips. The agency would rather consolidate its barge operations than abandon them.
A deterrent to more private investment is a new Federal rule with the effect of classifying petroleum-contaminated soil - of which there is much in Oil City - as hazardous waste, therefore making any cleanup of the oil-tank areas more complex and costly.
The Department of Environmental Conservation has petitioned the Environmental Protection Agency to drop the stricter regulations since New York has a thorough program for getting rid of petroleum-contaminated waste.
Finally, the economic downturn and sagging real-estate market in the Northeast bodes ill for Oil City, at least in the short term. Tightened lending policies are a concern since the prospect of an environmental cleanup could worry banks, making financing hard to come by for the thousands of condominiums and rental units and hundreds of thousands of square feet of office space envisioned.
 
'It's a Grave Threat'
''That's something that is more than a pall on this project, it's a grave threat,'' said Eric Mower, vice chairman of the Greater Syracuse Chamber of Commerce and owner of both a condominium and advertising and public-relations company with offices in Franklin Square.
Despite all this, state and city officials assert that Oil City's renaissance will come to fruition, maybe not overnight but certainly over several years.
''The economy may slow things down, but the internal logic of that project, which is to restore to a vibrant area a magnificent resource based upon Onondaga Lake, will push it forward,'' said Thomas C. Jorling, Commissioner of Environmental Conservation.
Environmental officials hope that Oil City's redevelopment could be a spur to cleaning up Onondaga Lake. The lake floor is lined with mercury, and the bottom third of the lake is without oxygen. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan has pledged to revive the lake, asking Congress this year for $1.75 million to study its cleanup.
 
Syracuse Would Suffer
The city expects Carousel Center to yield $165 million over 25 years from Pyramid in payments in lieu of taxes. The city has already committed that money to improving Oil City's utilities and systems.
Susan E. Hopkins, director of the city's Lakefront Development Office, said she was talking with a ''half-dozen developers who are seriously interested,'' but declined to name them.
If Oil City does stumble, most agree, Syracuse will suffer. One reason is the limited potential for growth in the downtown, severed by Interstates 81 and 690.
''There are a lot of other cities looking for more jobs and more companies, and some communities will win over the next 10 years and some will lose,'' Mr. Mower said. ''To have a lake and harbor flourishing in downtown Syracuse - that is more than just another gemstone in this community's tiara. It may well be the centerstone.''

HEADLINE: Labor Talks Begin With Charges of Meddling

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
Negotiations between New York City and its labor unions began yesterday on a bitter note with union leaders assailing what they called meddling by two prominent public figures.
The union leaders singled out Felix G. Rohatyn and Andrew J. Stein, accusing Mr. Rohatyn of poisoning the labor relations atmosphere and Mr. Stein of trying to thwart their efforts to gain new contracts.
''Felix Rohatyn has made it impossible for us to play on a level playing field,'' Barry Feinstein, the president of Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said at a news conference. ''We won't come to a table with Rohatyn at it. He is now the enemy. We are talking about a man who tries to bust unions. We will not deal with him in any capacity. So let's have the fight, let's have the war.'' 
Though Mr. Rohatyn, chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, a state watchdog agency set up during the city's 1970's fiscal crisis, has no direct role in labor negotiations, he has attacked the teachers' 5.5 percent raise as excessive and has urged rescinding it. He has proposed that other unions get no raise because of the city's faltering economy. Yesterday Mr. Rohatyn declined to comment on Mr. Feinstein's statements.
 
Opposition to Raise 'Resented'
After Mr. Feinstein criticized Mr. Rohatyn at the news conference, Stanley Hill, executive director of District Council 37, attacked Mr. Stein, the City Council President. Mr. Stein has opposed the teachers' raise as excessive. Mr. Hill said that Mr. Stein ''was'' a friend of labor, emphasizing the past tense, and that the unions ''resent'' his recent stand.
Mr. Stein said in an interview that he still considered himself a friend of labor but warned that the teachers' raise, if followed for the other unions, would result in widespread layoffs, higher taxes and sharply reduced services. The unions represented included transit workers, firefighters, correction guards, hospital workers and physicians.

HEADLINE: Quebec Hydropower Battle Entangles Utilities in U.S.

BYLINE: By ALLAN R. GOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GREAT WHALE, Quebec

 BODY:
New York and New England power officials have become reluctant participants in a dispute over whether one of Canada's biggest utilities should expand its generating capacity.
Utilities in the Northeast have purchased substantial amounts of power from the Canadian company, Hydro-Quebec, since the late 1970's. New contracts would extend those ties well into the next century. But environmentalists in the United States are hoping to derail the sales as both economically and environmentally unsound. 
In New York, purchases of Hydro-Quebec power have accounted for as much as 9 percent of the electricity supply in a year. Utility planners expect that by the year 2000, Canadian power sources will supply 30 percent of new electricity demand in the state.
 
A Buy-or-Build Choice
If the state cannot buy Hydro-Quebec power, said Richard M. Flynn, chairman of the New York Power Authority, new power plants would be needed to meet expected demand. The authority, Hydro-Quebec's largest customer outside Canada, supplies one-quarter of the state's electricity.
Hydro-Quebec wants to increase greatly the hydroelectric power it generates from the remote James Bay region in northern Quebec. It plans new hydroelectric projects on the Great Whale River near here, 650 miles north of Montreal, and on several rivers south of the huge La Grande hydroelectric complex, now operating.
Indians and Eskimos in the region and environmentalists in Canada and the United States oppose the new projects. They say Hydro-Quebec has given short shrift to energy conservation, the environment and the rights of the Cree and Inuit people who live in this isolated, subarctic territory.
The Sierra Club and the Crees have sued the authority, trying to block two new contracts to buy electricity from Hydro-Quebec. One contract would extend until 2018 an agreement to supply 800,000 kilowatts from April to October each year. A second, 21-year contract, effective in 1995, would commit Hydro-Quebec to supply one million kilowatts year-round, enough for one million households at any given moment.
The total cost of the purchases would be about $19 billion. The Sierra Club wants the power authority to study the environmental consequences of a power purchase from Hydro-Quebec.
''Energy conservation in New England, New York and Quebec could meet many times the demand that the new dams would serve,'' said James A. Dumont, a Middlebury, Vt., lawyer for the Sierra Club and the Cree.
The authority says buying Canadian hydroelectric power is cheaper than building plants of its own and does not carry the environmental problems of oil- and coal-fueled plants. Judge Kenneth Shorter of State Supreme Court in Manhattan is expected to rule soon.
Canada's National Energy Board recently approved Hydro-Quebec's proposed sale of power to New York and Vermont utilities. But the board made the sales contingent on a study examining the environmental impact of the new James Bay projects.

HEADLINE: EDUCATION;
Student Protest Movement Expands, and Its Voice Is That of the Consumer

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 16

 BODY:
It was a situation guaranteed to warm the heart of any campus radical of the 1960's.
For nearly two weeks, the main campus of the University of the District of Columbia echoed with the chants of students occupying the school's administration building. They threatened to keep the school closed until they got the resignations of certain members of the school's board, child care for students with children, longer library hours and other demands, 45 in all.
There would have been only one puzzlement to any aging 60's-era protester: The students' chief demand was not ''Peace Now,'' or ''Free the Chicago 7.'' It was, quite simply, a demand for a better education. 
Unlike their counterparts a generation ago, college students today are increasingly as likely to protest over the quality of their education as over the many social causes usually embraced by undergraduates. Across the country, recent student protests have been generated by concerns about class size, cutbacks in the number of classes and courses, other curriculum issues, unavailability of professors and foreign teaching assistants who cannot be understood by English-speaking students.
 
Students Are More Vocal
''We're seeing students be more vocal on their insistence on high quality in all aspects of their educational experience,'' said Dan Abrahamowicz, dean of students at the University of Toledo. ''They're acting in a way like consumers. They're saying: 'I'm paying top dollar for an education and I expect to get it.' ''
Part of the reason for this new educational consumerism at some schools may be the nature of the clientele. The University of the District of Columbia is a 13-year-old, publicly financed urban institution that caters to a largely working-class, predominantly black pool of students, most of whom are older than typical college students and go to school part time, and more than half of whom are women, many with children. These students - who achieved 42 of their 45 demands before the university reopened Oct. 9 - are first and foremost pragmatic.
Across the Potomac River, Northern Virginia Community College's suburban, predominantly white, working-class students were just as pragmatic about the quality of their education, but they took a different action.
When Gov. L. Douglas Wilder's budget cuts threatened to eliminate personnel and classes at the Virginia college, the second-largest community college in the nation, the students did not shut down the five-campus, 59,000-student institution. Instead, they petitioned for a temporary increase in tuition.
 
Higher Fees Sought
The students succeeded in getting a one-semester surcharge of $3 added to the $28.60 fee for each credit hour. Without the surcharge, a college official said, the administration would have had to increase the number of students in classes and some courses would not have been offered.
''Education is so valuable that that insignificant increase is worth it,'' said Milton Hodges, president of the Black Student Alliance and one of the students who presented the petition. Mr. Hodges started United Student Leaders for Quality Eduation, which led the push for the surcharge.
Elizabeth Grizzard, dean of students at the college's Annandale campus, said that because the majority of students work they were attuned to the marketplace and getting value for their money.
''They think about the marketplace all the time,'' she said, ''and they realize that sometimes you need to pay more to get a better product.
''Our tuition is very, very reasonable, and the students believed they could relieve some of the financial stress through this. They worked that out in their heads and nobody influenced them to do this. They led the charge.''
''They were really humorous about it,'' Ms. Grizzard added, ''translating the surcharge into six-packs and suggesting that by merely foregoing a six-pack or two, a student could pay the surcharge.''
 
Cutbacks Raise Concerns
Money is not the only thing necessary for quality, but cutbacks raise concerns about it, said Janet Hanson, director for policy analysis for the College Board, a non-profit educatinal company.
''If the decade of the '90s is, as is expected, a difficult one economically,'' Ms. Hanson said, ''it will be a period when institutions are under pressure to keep costs under control. That will raise issues of quality.''
Educational consumerism has not displaced other student concerns. Students continue to protest racism on campus, apartheid in South Africa, United States involvement in Central America and various environmental issues.
But concerns about educational quality are on the rise, and students are equally vocal about quality at many private institutions. In 1986, students at Syracuse University formed Undergraduates for a Better Education to push for smaller classes and teaching assistants whom English-speaking students could understand.
 
Survey at Syracuse
The Syracuse group is currently surveying undergraduates about their views on education quality, the size of classes, access to professors and other education issues.
''At these big, research-oriented private universities, you're paying $15,000 to $20,000 a year,'' said Catherine Sessler, president of Undergraduates for a Better Education. ''Students realize that there are problems out there. They had better ask questions now because that is a lot of money to be shelling out. Given the constraints on the economy, students are going to be the asking what they're getting for their money a lot more.''
William Coplin, director of the public affairs program at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, said: ''U.B.E. has had a really big impact here at Syracuse.'' But he added that students often do not understand the long-range problems a university must take into account.
''Students want better quality,'' Mr. Coplin said, ''but the institution is so complex it is hard to focus on how to get it. You can't just demonstrate. They don't know what forces are at work -why the curriculum is this way, why adjunct professors are used to the degree that they are. And they better watch it when they start asking for academic 'quality.' They may just get some very esoteric courses.''
 
Training for Assistants
Nonetheless, student demands, expressed in various ways at various campuses, have brought action. Syracuse, the University of California at Los Angeles, Pennsylvania State University and Purdue University, among others, have instituted training programs and proficiency standards for teaching assistants from foreign countries, to make sure they can communicate well in English. Other universities have put students on various boards and committees in their search to satisfy rising student demands.
But what exactly quality is and who determines it are areas fraught with wranglings. Arguments abound over the validity of ethnic studies and women's studies, even which departments such courses belong in and which professors should teach them.
At San Francisco State University, students and faculty in the School of Ethnic Studies have been protesting the placement of a black politics course in the political science department, arguing that it is a first step toward eliminating the 20-year-old ethnic studies school by dispersing its courses. School officials maintain that the course was moved to woo a more diverse student enrollment to the political science department.
As the student population becomes more ethnically diverse, experts say that whether these courses should be incorporated into the traditional curriculum or be separate departments will be a primary area of student activism.
''This new consumer movement has taken universities very much by surprise,'' said Charles Sykes, whose book, ''Profscam: Professors and the Demise of Higher Education,'' published in 1988 by Regnery Gateway, was a widely read and harsh critique of higher education. ''It really challenges the schools. You're going to see this grow exponentially.''
Or as one of the student protesters at the University of the District of Columbia said to administrators when the school reopened: ''We will police you until we get all that we can get -a quality education, a better education.''

The three styles are top-of-the-line, fully loaded extra virgin; pure, for everyday cooking; and an extra light, a highly refined variety of pure. 
The extra-virgin oil is fairly lush and fruity without the peppery intensity of other extra-virgin Tuscan oils. The oils carry a sticker price of about $7.50 for a liter of extra virgin, and about a dollar less for the others.
 
It Wasn't Truffle Weather
Northern Italy's white truffle harvest limps along. Rosario Safina, president of Urbani Truffle, a major importer, said: ''There was no snow last winter, no spring rain and a dry hot summer. It was great for tourists but terrible for truffles.''
Prices for large white truffles are close to $1,000 a pound. At Balducci's, 424 Avenue of the Americas (Ninth Street), they are $900 a pound, $600 a pound for small ones. At Grace's Marketplace, 1237 Third Avenue (71st Street), they are $55 an ounce.
Lou Todaro, the importer who owns Todaro Brothers, at 555 Second Avenue (31st Street), said: ''Forget about it. I doubt if I will bring any in at these prices, especially considering the economy.'' Fair or Tare Weight? Mark Green, the New York Commissioner of Consumer Affairs, is warning consumers about overcharging by salad bars, delicatessens and bakery counters.
On Friday he announced that 115 stores had been fined for not deducting the container's weight from the total. Containers weigh a fraction of an ounce, translating to pennies in the price of a salad, but adding up to $12 million a year citywide, Mr. Green said.
Members of his staff visited 254 salad bars, delis, bakeries and supermarkets in the five boroughs to purchase food anonymously. Fines from $30 to $100 must be paid by the violators. Mr. Green advised consumers to ask that purchases be reweighed properly if the container weight is not deducted.
 
Filtering Aid to Forests
Manufacturers of coffee filters are backing reforestation. Melitta of Germany, the world's largest producer of coffee filters, is donating money to the American Forestry Association's Global Releaf program, hoping to pay for planting two trees for every one used in making filters. Melitta uses pulp from America and Canadian trees for filters sold here.
Not to be outdone, Mr. Coffee Inc., based in Bedford Heights, Ohio, has also joined with the American forestry association's program to help finance needed tree plantings in cities around the country. The project began yesterday in Limon, Colo., with the replanting of trees destroyed by a recent tornado.
 
2 Books, Boiled Down
 
A PAIR of informative cooks' guides are now available in handy paperbacks. For the historically minded, there is the Dictionary of Cuisine by Alexandre Dumas. Edited, abridged and translated by Louis Coleman Fireside, $9.95), it is based on ''Le Grand Dictionnaire de la Cuisine,'' published in 1873.
The striking photography of the original ''Cook's Ingredients'' stands out as well in the new version, edited by Adrian Bailey (Reader's Digest, $14.95). But instead of having the photographs and text in separate sections, as in the book published in England by Dorling Kindersley in 1980, the sections are combined.

To The Living Section:
As a home economics teacher, I was delighted to see an article related to my specialty in The New York Times [''In the New Home Ec, Choices for Life,'' Sept. 26]. However, a large part of the story of home economics was not included in the article. As stated, ''home and career skills,'' as it is now called in the New York education curriculum, is not a required subject. It is an elective and a poorly promoted one at that. The ''major'' subjects - social studies, math, sciences and English - are usually studied for 12 academic years. Special topics in these areas plus languages, art and music are suggested elective courses in high school. Business and computer courses are promoted by guidance counselors because, of course, we must prepare for the outside world! 
But home economics, well, it's a minor and its topics, which include parenting, child development, family relationships, consumer education, nutrition, food preparation, decision making, career choices, clothing and textiles and interior design are considered minor ones in academic circles.
The young girl and/or boy upon graduation, however, will rarely multiply fractions or discuss the War of 1812, but will be faced daily with decisions relating to the home economics topics.
Teen-agers might prefer to prepare a hamburger rather than go to McDonald's if they knew how, and they might prepare minestrone soup rather than the hamburger if they had studied home economics. They might choose to use birth control if they had participated in a challenging course in child care.
Schools are called upon to assume a greater share of the child-care role and academic standards continue to decrease, not because schools aren't trying hard enough but because parents aren't trying hard enough. And parents aren't trying hard enough not because they don't want to but because they don't know how. The problems will increase in the next generation because we withhold access to this ''minor'' subject. When will there be an educator brave enough to mandate even two years of home economics in the 12-year educational life of our future generation?

HEADLINE: WINE TALK

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial

 BODY:
FOR many years, there was an excellent Greek restaurant on Eighth Avenue between 43d and 44th Streets, just around the corner from my office. It was called the Parthenon, and some of the freshest fish in New York came from its kitchen. For the regulars there was always a simple oinos lefkos, an expensive Greek white wine, with just the right acidity to match the oil in the fish. What was the name of it? What difference? The restaurant is gone now, and with it, one of the few chances to find decent Greek wines in New York. Oh, they turn up now and then, but almost exclusively in other Greek restaurants. They are considered an ethnic item, like taramosalata or sweet coffee with the grounds in the cup.
This may sound like heresy, but, for the moment at least, it isn't actually necessary to have access to Greek wines to enjoy them. 
There is no substitute for the real thing, of course, but a new book will do quite well until the real thing comes along. It is Miles Lambert-Gocs's ''The Wines of Greece.'' (Faber & Faber, $24.95 cloth, $13.95 paper), which is just now reaching the book shops.
Let's be frank. These are lean times in the wine business. Even the French and the Californians are threatened by mineral water. An advocate of Greek wines these days is truly a voice crying in the wilderness.
Mr. Lambert-Gocs, ardent proselyte though he may be, knows that he is not about to change things. Few retailers will rush to stock their shelves with Mavrodaphne and such on the basis of one book. No matter. Mr. Lambert-Gocs rises above the exigencies of the marketplace. He well knows that his readers are not about to descend on their local merchants demanding obscure vintages from Samos and the Eastern Sporades, or the red wines of Crete that, in Hugh Johnson's telling phrase, are ''more suited, perhaps, for Minoan than modern man.''
What he offers is an exciting armchair voyage through one of the oldest, least-known and, ultimately, most intriguing wine regions in the world. Mr. Lambert-Gocs, whose name is a nom de plume, is an agricultural economist in the service of the United States Department of Agriculture specializing in Greece and Eastern Europe. He is also a scholar, as anyone who has encountered his work under the same name on zinfandel and tokay in The Journal of Gastronomy will readily attest.
In his preface, the author says ''contemporary Greek wine is my focus.'' And so, perhaps, it should be. Happily, each of the 11 regional chapters includes a section on ''classical reflections,'' and the book itself concludes with a chapter on, as the author puts it, ''what I think is a vital and relevant picture of Greek wine in antiquity.''
And that, for this reader, at least, is the core of the book. Few of us are likely to be tasting our way through the Cyclades in the near future, but who among us has never thrilled to an allusion to the ''wine-dark sea''?
Certainly the current scene has its fascination. For example, on the windswept island of Santorini, some 70 miles north of Crete, the largest winery is that of the Koutsouyanopoulos Brothers.
Mr. Lambert-Gocs has good things to say about the brothers' white wines - one called Volcan, the other, Lava - but even if he did not, it would be worth a visit just to see their label.
More to the point are his comments on Crete where, he says, ''to explore the sources of the Cretan tradition is to trace the essentials of wine-growing back four millenia.'' The remains of an ancient vineyard found at Kato Zakros in eastern Crete, date from the early second millenium B.C., Mr. Lambert-Gocs goes on to say, and provide ''the earliest conclusive evidence of systematic cultivation of grape types destined specifically for wine production.''
According to the author, Greek wine production persisted, with considerable vigor, from antiquity through most of Byzantium and did not seriously wane until the five-century rule of the Ottoman Empire from the 14th to the 19th century.
After that - the last of the Turks didn't leave until 1913 - the Greek vineyards suffered from wars and disease, but most of all from emigration. Phylloxera, the insect that devastated the vineyards of Western Europe in the late 19th century, did not arrive in some areas of Greece until the 1950's and 1960's, but emigration, particularly in poor regions such as Epirus, left vast areas once covered in vines virtually abandoned.
Nevertheless, winegrowing is thriving in Greece, and according to Mr. Lambert-Gocs, wine quality is improving almost exponentially. He credits the introduction of appellation controls beginning in 1969. By 1972, 21 wine-producing regions had been given appellation status. Four additional regions were added in the 1980's and, the author says, more are to come.
Still, as any wine lover can attest, finding good Greek wines is not easy. Mr. Lambert-Gocs agrees. ''Few of the better ones have been exported at all, even fewer are exported on an ongoing basis, and still fewer are ever distributed abroad outside Greek ethnic channels.''
A few serious Greek restaurants stock some of the better Greek wines, but finding something to compare to the best of Italy or France or California is not easy. Mr. Lambert-Gocs is optimistic. He notes that Greek wine makers are convinced that the 21st century will see them regain the reputation they had in ancient times.
The 21st century is nine years and a few months away. Get ready for it by reading ''The Wines of Greece.''
 
TASTINGS
La Vieille Ferme Cotes de Ventoux, 1989, $4 to $5. A bottle of decent French red wine for about $4? Yes, it can be done and La Vieille Ferme proves it. This wine - the name means the Old Farm - is made by the Perrin family, who also own Chateau de Beaucastel in Chateauneuf-du-Pape. Beaucastel is relatively small and special. La Vieille Ferme is a huge operation that specializes in good, inexpensive wine. Originally the Vieille Ferme appellation was Cotes-du-Rhone. The Gold Label version still is. But the standard wine - and the most popular - is Cotes de Ventoux, which comes from vineyards in the Vaucluse. The grapes are the same as in the Cotes-du-Rhone - grenache, carignan, syrah, cinsaut, mourvedre - and the alcoholic content is about the same, 11 percent. Once these were light wines, but in recent years the style has changed to give them more body and color. Some special Cotes-du-Rhones stand out from the crowd, but the Vieille Ferme Cotes de Ventoux will match most others and at a lower price. These wines represent very good value.

Paz a Known Quantity
Octavio Paz is not only the first Mexican to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. He is also one of the few foreign Nobel laureates in recent times whose books were widely available in the United States when he won the award. It was next to impossible, for example, to find the works of such previous Nobel winners as Camilo Jose Cela (1989), Naguib Mahfouz (1988), Claude Simon (1985) and Jaroslav Siefert (1984).
In the case of Mr. Paz, ''widely available'' may be stretching things, since none of his books have enjoyed huge printings. But 20 of his volumes of poetry or essays are still in print; his best-known book, ''The Labyrinth of Solitude,'' from Grove Weidenfeld, has been readily available for several decades. 
Grove Weidenfeld has two other Paz books in print; New Directions, which has published the poetry of Mr. Paz for 40 years, has six of his books in print; Harcourt Brace Jovanovich has available two collections of Paz essays, and Seaver Books, now distributed through Arcade, an imprint of Little, Brown, has five Paz titles; so, too, does the Harvard University Press, the University of Texas Press and such smaller houses as Latitudes Press, Riverrun and George Braziller.
 
Reissuing 'Bernstein'
Ballantine Books said yesterday that it was going back for a new printing of ''Bernstein,'' by Joan Peyser, a biography of Leonard Bernstein, who died on Sunday. The book, published in hard cover by William Morrow & Company, was reprinted by Ballantine in a mass-market paperback edition in July 1988.
 
A Tiny Toons Line
Longmeadow Press, the publishing arm of Waldenbooks, has taken a major step forward as a publisher in recent weeks with its new line of children's books, based on the Warner Brothers Looney Tunes characters. The new characters, known as Tiny Toons, are the offspring of a joint venture between Steven Spielberg and LCA Entertainment, the licensing division of Warner Brothers.
Ron Jaffe, the senior director of marketing at Waldenbooks, said his company had acquired the license to publish books based on those characters for prices ranging from about $5 up, while the Western Publishing Company has the license for the lower-priced books. (Western's Golden Books and Whitman imprints are a staple in supermarkets and similar retail outlets.) Five of Landmark's Tiny Toon Adventures, as the series is called, are already in stores, aimed at ages 2 to 9 and selling for $4.95 and $5.95. They were published last month to coincide with the debut of the television series, produced by Mr. Spielberg and Amblin Entertainment. Longmeadow plans to publish as many as 25 Tiny Toon titles during the next three years.
 
Appeal Still Weighed
A spokeswoman for Simon & Schuster said yesterday that the company had not yet decided whether to appeal the recent decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in Manhattan, upholding the constitutionality of New York's ''Son of Sam'' law. That law decrees that convicted criminals cannot profit from their crimes, and that money they earn from books or motion pictures must be used primarily to repay their victims. Thus the New York State Crime Victims Board sought $96,250 that the publisher had deposited in an escrow account for Henry Hill, a mobster whose life is the subject of ''Wiseguy: Life in a Mafia Family,'' by Nicholas Pileggi, published in 1986.
The publisher contended that the law violated constitutionally protected free speech, and could make such books unavailable in the future. But the appeals court, by a 2-to-1 vote, declared on Oct. 3 that concern for victims' rights outweighed free speech rights, adding that the law does not prevent criminals from writing about themselves, only from making a profit when they do so.
 
On the Soviet Economy
When in 1971 the University of New Mexico Press published ''Alienation and the Soviet Economy,'' by Paul Craig Roberts, a book analyzing the inherent weaknesses of Soviet planning, the book did not make much of a stir and eventually went out of print.
Next month, however, it will be reissued by Holmes & Meier Publishers, a New York house that specializes in scholarly books.
It is being co-published with the Independent Institute, a nonprofit organization that publishes a series of books on public policy. The book will also be published early next year in the Soviet Union, where it has been widely praised by members of the Academy of Sciences.

HEADLINE: Ideas That Changed Wall St. And Fathered Mutual Funds

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
Few Nobel awards in economics, it is safe to say, will be as enthusiastically received within the profession as this year's award to Harry M. Markowitz, Merton H. Miller and William F. Sharpe.
To academics, they are top-shelf theoreticians whose quarter-century-old insights into the economics of finance still dazzle the brightest graduate students. To nuts-and-bolts types, they are researchers whose ideas have changed Wall Street and the investment habits of millions of people.
''You can view them as the intellectual fathers of the mutual fund business,'' said Robert Litan, an economist at the Brookings Institution. 
Harry Markowitz's work came first, in the early 1950's, and probably had the greatest intellectual fallout. The prudence of not putting all of one's eggs into one basket had been understood intuitively for centuries. But it was Dr. Markowitz who refined the economic logic of diversification and offered a practical way to choose an ''optimal portfolio'' of assets.
Assets, whether General Motors stock, barrels of crude oil or building lots in Florida, can be classified by the likely return and the probability that the return will deviate from expectations. Investors might decide, for example, that G.M. stock will pay a $3 dividend, but there is a 10 percent chance that it will be higher than $3.50 or lower than $2.50.
Diversifying - say, buying $25,000 worth of each of two stocks rather than $50,000 worth of one - will change both the likely return on the investments and the risk that the actual return will be larger or smaller. Mixing G.M. and Ford stock might not change the risk-return prospects much because each of the American auto makers is subject to similar market shocks.
 
Mixing Assets to Cut Risk
But mixing G.M. shares with those of, say, Exxon would probably allow the investor to achieve the same return with less chance of losing a lot of money. The high oil prices that would hurt G.M.'s sales would be offset by Exxon's higher profits at the pump.
Dr. Markowitz showed how to measure the risk associated with different assets and how to mix assets in ways that would achieve the maximum likely overall return with the least possible risk. Those techniques, greatly enhanced by subsequent research and the number-crunching ability of computers, are now routinely used by sophisticated institutional investors - ''even by money managers who have never heard of Harry Markowitz or portfolio theory,'' Burton Malkiel, an economist at Princeton, points out.
William Sharpe built on Dr. Markowitz's foundation. And along with James Tobin of Yale (who won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science in 1981) he greatly enriched the concept and the practical value of the portfolio theory.
Dr. Markowitz had offered investors a menu of portfolios, different blends of assets that generated the best possible trade-off between the virtue of high expected return and the vice of high risk. Dr. Sharpe had the simple but elegant insight to approach the same questions from the other side of the equation.
 
Adjusting Prices of Assets
All valued assets have to be in someone's portfolio, because all assets are owned by someone. Thus buyers and sellers must adjust the prices of assets to make them attractive enough to fit into someone's ''optimal'' portfolio.
Now for the shocker: once assets are properly priced, a single mix of risky assets fits into every investor's portfolio, regardless of one's taste for taking chances. Those with less appetite for risk than the blend afforded could mix it with a ''riskless'' asset - putting, say, $10,000 in stocks and $40,000 in an insured bank deposit. Those with more appetite for risk could borrow money to buy more - say, borrowing an extra $100,000 to buy $150,000 worth of stock.
One direct consequence of Dr. Sharpe's work was the emergence of ''beta,'' a measure of the portfolio risk that clever diversification could not vanquish. Beta, which is widely used by Wall Street (and ignored by less sophisticated investors at the peril of their purses) compares the risk of holding one mix of stocks with stocks in general.
A mutual fund with a beta of, say, 1.3, is likely to go up (or down) by 13 percent if the stock market goes up (or down) by 10 percent. When assets are properly valued, Dr. Sharpe's work suggests, the expected return should be roughly proportional to beta. Thus if a mutual fund is twice as risky as the market in general, the managers are not doing their job well unless, on average, it delivers twice the return of the average stock. To Borrow or Sell Equity? Merton Miller took the Markowitz concept and ran with it in an entirely different - and possibly even more important - direction. Collaborating with Franco Modigliani of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (who won the Nobel award in 1985), he vanquished the conventional wisdom on how corporations should structure their finances.
Before the Modigliani-Miller theorem was published in 1958 it was generally assumed that companies could raise capital cheaply by borrowing or raise it safely by issuing more stock. The best mix of debt to equity - the mix that would make the company most valuable to its owner-investors - was one that somehow balanced the cost of capital against the risks inherent in greater financial leverage.
To Dr. Modigliani and Dr. Miller, that did not square with portfolio theory. More debt might make profits vary more from year to year. But the extra risk should not affect the price of the stock because conservative investors would always have the option of ''deleveraging'' their assets by holding more of a low-risk asset like bank deposits. Thus the optimal mix of debt and equity was simply the cheapest mix. It follows that in equilibrium, the cost of raising capital by selling stock or selling bonds should be equal.
Two real-world phenomena, taxes and potential losses in bankruptcy, do muddy this crystal-clear insight. In the end it may still serve investors' interests for companies to pay more (or less) for borrowed money. But as Dr. Litan argues, the Modigliani-Miller theorem ''clarified what it was that explains the difference.''
Portfolio theory changed - or more accurately, created - the modern discipline of financial economics. But Fisher Black, an economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company, says its contributions to economics do not end there.
The portfolio theorists, he says, ''were far ahead of mainstream economists in analyzing uncertainty.'' Many of the techniques now used to predict, say, the impact of changes in money supply on changes in interest rates can be traced to earlier investigations of asset risk.

HEADLINE: Five Big Drug Companies Show Strong Income Gains

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
Riding high in the face of economic weaknesses that have reduced profits in other industries, five major pharmaceutical companies reported strong gains in quarterly earnings yesterday.
Helped by new product sales and favorable currency exchange rates, net income rose 20.9 percent in the quarter that ended Sept. 30 at Eli Lilly & Company, 19.1 percent at Merck & Company and 16.7 percent at the Warner-Lambert Company. The American Home Products Corporation had a 14.2 percent gain and Pfizer Inc. an 11.9 percent increase.
But the five company's shares all dropped yesterday in a general decline in stock prices. 
 
Eli Lilly
Lilly, based in Indianapolis, said sales in the quarter increased by 29.3 percent, to $1.28 billion, from $991.0 million in the 1989 quarter. Net income rose to $256.8 million, or 90 cents a share, from $212.4 million, or 73 cents a share.
Richard D. Wood, Lilly's chairman, said sales and earnings set records, rising in each of the company's three main businesses: drugs, medical devices and diagnostic products. Ronald Nordmann at Paine Webber Securities, said that Lilly's drug sales rose by 31 percent, with overseas sales particularly strong.
Mr. Nordmann added that Lilly's earnings per share in the quarter would have shown a 38.5 percent increase, if ''extraordinary items'' reported in the third quarter of 1989 were taken into account. He said that Lilly had attributed about $42.4 million at that time to renegotiation of the debt instrument it got from Faberge Inc. in the 1987 sale of its Elizabeth Arden unit, and income from the settlement of a patent dispute.
Mr. Wood said important contributors to the sales growth included Lilly's antibiotics, genetically engineered human insulin and Prozac, an anti-depressant drug. Mr. Nordmann said Prozac sales in the period rose nearly 17 percent, to $210 million, from $180 million in the preceeding quarter, ''in spite of signficant negative publicity and lawsuits.'' Critics say that some people who took Prozac have experienced life-endangering side effects; many psychiatrists have said that the drug is effective and relatively safe.
Lilly shares were $74.75 on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, down $1.375.
 
Merck
Merck, the world's largest pharmaceutical company, said sales rose 17.2 percent in the quarter, to $1.91 billion, from $1.63 billion in the 1989 period. Earnings rose to $465 million, or $1.19 a share, from $390.5 million, or 99 cents a share, a year earlier.
Dr. P. Roy Vagelos, chairman of Merck, which is based in Rahway, N.J., said that ''sales growth was led by newer products.'' He added, ''Both our domestic and international operations reported solid gains in units sold.''
Mr. Nordmann at Paine Webber said that sales of Vasotec, the nation's largest-selling blood-pressure drug, rose by 25 percent in the quarter over a year earlier and would be $1.4 billion for the year. Merck also had sales gains in the quarter for Mevacor, a cholesterol-lowering agent that rose 43 percent; Pepcid, an ulcer treatment, up 67 percent, and Prilosec, a new type of gastrointestinal drug, which was introduced late in 1989.
Dr. Vagelos said the dollar's decline raised Merck's sales by one percentage point in the first nine months. Merck calculates its overseas earnings in dollars, closely reflecting currency changes. Mr. Nordmann attributed 4 percentage points of the 17 percent quarterly sales gain to the dollar's slide, 11 points to growth in numbers of products sold and 2 percentage points to price increases.
Merck stock fell 62.5 cents on the Big Board yesterday, closing at $77.875.
 
Warner-Lambert
Quarterly sales at the Warner-Lambert Company, based in Morris Plains, N.J., rose 7.1 percent, to a record $1.19 billion from $1.11 billion. The company said that sales growth would have been 5 percent if currency rates had not changed.
Net income climbed to $124.8 million, or 93 cents a share, from $106.9 million, or 79 cents a share, which was restated to reflect a 2-for-1 stock split in May 1990.
Joseph D. Williams, Warner-Lambert's chairman, said that the gains were fueled by worldwide sales of prescription drugs, which rose by 15 percent, to $390 million. Analysts said that quarterly pharmaceutical sales were led by its cholesterol-regulating drug, Lopid, which rose 19.4 percent, to $91 million.
Warner-Lambert closed at $60.375 yesterday, down 62.5 cents.
 
American Home
American Home Products, based in New York, said that third-quarter sales declined 1.6 percent, to $1.74 billion, from $1.77 billion a year ago, reflecting the sale in June 1990 of the company's Boyle-Midway household products unit. Nevertheless, earnings rose to $317.6 million, or $1.01 a share, from $278.2 million, or 89 cents, reflecting a 2-for-1 stock split on April 19.
John R. Stafford, American Home's chairman, said that taking out the effects of the Boyle-Midway divestiture, sales in the quarter rose 5 percent.
Mary Ellen McCarthy at Shearson Lehman Brothers said that the results were encouraging. Pharmaceutical sales increased by 10 percent, she said, ''the best showing for American Home in a long time. The synergies from American Home's acquisition of the A.H. Robins Company are really there.''
American Home Products lost $1.125, closing at $45.625.
 
Pfizer
Pfizer, which is also based in New York, said third-quarter sales rose 14.2 percent, to $1.64 billion, from $1.44 billion. Net income climbed to $243.3 million, or $1.45 a share, from $217.5 million, or $1.29 a share a year earlier.
Pfizer said drug sales increased by 22 percent and hospital products, 17 percent. Consumer products were up 10 percent and chemicals 13 percent. Specialty mineral sales declined 16 percent, reflecting the sale of Pfizer's pigments business this year.
Edmund T. Pratt Jr., Pfizer's chairman, said new products like Procardia XL, a heart drug, and Diflucan, an anti-fungal agent, accounted for more than one-fourth of the growth in drug sales. Analysts said Procardia XL sales were $127 million in the quarter.
Pfizer dropped 87.5 cents yesterday, to $72.25.

HEADLINE: 3 U.S. Economists Win Nobel

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: STOCKHOLM, Oct. 16

 BODY:
The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science was awarded today to three Americans whose pioneering work provided new tools for weighing the risks and rewards of different investments and for valuing corporate stocks and bonds.
The three are Harry M. Markowitz of Baruch College of the City University of New York, William F. Sharpe of Stanford University and Merton H. Miller of the University of Chicago.
Their work is known individually as Portfolio Theory, the Capital Asset Pricing Model and the Miller-Modigliani Theorem. Collectively, their theories are widely applied today. They influence the investment decisions of stockbrokers, bankers, mutual fund managers, government agencies and millions of individuals. 
 
Theories Now Taken for Granted
These theories, although taken for granted today, were considered innovative when they were developed in the 1950's and 60's. For investors, the research offered a way to tailor one's holdings to mirror one's willingness to take risks. For financial specialists and economists, the theories explained how the weighing of risks and rewards helps to determine securities prices and how factors like tax changes and bankruptcy affect those values.
Corporate finance experts use the theories to value potential acquisitions and to make decisions about dividends and financings. Governments use them to assess the potential impact of a tax change on different parts of the economy. And a public utility commission might use them to determine the prices that would give an electric company enough return on its investments so that it could build needed power plants.
 
'They Are All Pioneers'
James Tobin, the Yale University professor who won the economics prize in 1981 and is now retired, said that in many ways the school of thought that believes financial markets are rational or efficient - that is, that the value of a company is always accurately reflected in the price of its stock - rests on the three men's work. ''They are all pioneers in finance theory, which has been flourishing in recent years,'' he said in a telephone interview from New Haven. ''But these guys were way ahead of the fashion.''
Assar Lindbeck, chairman of the prize committee at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, noted that while the three did not collaborate, their work was a continuum.
''Each one of them gave one building block for a unified theory of financial economics,'' he said. ''This theory would have been incomplete if one of these pieces were missing.''
In a telephone interview from Cambridge, Mass., Franco Modigliani, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, called the prize ''the final seal of approval'' for recognizing ''for the first time that finance is a major area of economics.'' Dr. Modigliani won the economics prize in 1985, partly for his theories about savings and partly for work on corporate finance theory, which he did with Dr. Miller in the 1950's and 60's.
He added, ''These three pieces of research work in a span of about 10 years changed finance from a field of purely institutional interest, where there was no theory or basic models to explain what was going on, into a flourishing area of economics that has given us a completely different understanding of what finance is all about.''
As with most of the other Nobel Prizes, the award for economics is given for work that has often been completed decades ago but has stood the test of time. Sometimes theories or projects that at first seemed arcane wind up gaining wide application, often with modern technology like computers as a catalyst.
The three will equally share the prize, which this year totals four million Swedish crowns, or about $710,000, paid by the Swedish central bank.
The economics prize was established in 1968 by the bank and first awarded the next year as a memorial to Alfred Nobel, the Swedish industrialist who invented dynamite. It is distinct from the Nobel Prizes in physics, chemistry, medicine, literature and peace, which were set up under the terms of Mr. Nobel's will and are financed from his legacy.
 
'Growing Branch' of Economics
In seeking out the three professors, said Lawrence Klein, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania who won the economics prize in 1980, ''the prize committee wanted to broaden the concept of economics, and these people represent a new, growing branch of the field.''
Dr. Markowitz, the Marvin Speiser Distinguished Professor of Finance and Economics at Baruch, developed the portfolio theory, which analyzes how wealth or savings can be optimally invested in assets that differ in terms of expected return and risk.
While investment managers and academic economists had long recognized the need to weigh potential returns against risks, Dr. Markowitz provided a formula to do so.
Dr. Sharpe, the Timken Professor of Finance at the Stanford Business School, used Dr. Markowitz's theory to develop a model for explaining how securities prices are established in the market to reflect risks and potential returns. His theory - the Capital Asset Pricing Model - is now widely used by investment firms to predict, for instance, how a stock will perform in relation to the overall market.
The committee noted that several other researchers independently contributed to this area in the mid-1960's, although it called Dr. Sharpe ''the leading figure.''
Dr. Miller, currently the Robert R. McCormick Distinguished Service Professor at the University of Chicago's Graduate School of Business, is widely considered to still be the dominant force in theoretical and empirical analysis in corporate finance.
He was awarded the economics prize for his theory explaining the relation between manufacturing companies' capital asset structure and dividend policy on the one hand, and their market value and cost of capital on the other.
Before the Modigliani-Miller theorem, many economists and corporate executives believed that if a company raised money by selling stock rather than borrowing, its value - based on the price of its securities -would rise because it would appeal to investors who thought the company was less risky than others with large debts.
But the theorem states that corporate executives should instead leave it to investors to reduce their risks by diversifying their portfolios. Corporate managers can best safeguard the interests of stockholders by maximizing their companies' net wealth.

G.E.'s Net Rises 9% In Quarter

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Although its performance was hampered by the weakening of the economy, the General Electric Company said yesterday that its net income climbed 9 percent in the third quarter, to $1.03 billion, from $945 million in the 1989 period.
Revenues rose 9.2 percent from last year's third-quarter levels, to $14.2 billion from $13 billion. Earnings per share rose more rapidly - up 12 percent, to $1.16, from $1.04 a year ago -because the Fairfield, Conn., conglomerate had purchased 35 million of its own shares since November as part of a $10 billion buyback plan.
Slower economic growth and the unsettled situation in the Middle East hurt General Electric's lighting, plastics, and appliance businesses, said John F. Welch Jr., chairman. The company said operating profits also fell at NBC, G.E.'s broadcasting subsidiary, and were about flat in the company's industrial products group. 
But a number of other G.E. businesses that operate on much long production and sales cycles, notably aircraft engines and power systems, had strong performances. The company said its financial services group and medical systems business also posted strong gains. And the appliance group managed to increase profits thanks to productivity gains, even though demand stagnated.
 
Stock Declines
Mr. Welch said the results added up to a good quarter, but investors were uneasy. The company provides only the sketchiest of information on the performance of its many subsidiaries, except for its year-end report. G.E.'s shares fell $2.875, to $51.50, in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Analysts tended to agree with Mr. Welch. ''Given the state of the economy, they are doing extremely well,'' said Russell L. Leavitt, who follows the company for Salomon Brothers.
The productivity gains in the appliance group were among the more pleasant surprises for Wall Street. Changes like moving refrigerator production from a high-cost Chicago plant to Decatur, Ala.; productivity improvements in Louisville, Ky., and programs to improve the quality of parts from suppliers helped the group report increased profit on flat sales. Big competitors like Whirlpool and Maytag are expected to report earnings declines, said Robert Cornell, who follows the industry for Shearson Lehman Hutton.
Both the aircraft engine group and the power systems group benefited from sales momentum, which has been a growing factor in G.E.'s performance for the last year. G.E. said that the power group received $300 million in new orders in the quarter, bringing the total for the year to $3 billion. The backlog of aircraft engine orders has climbed to $14.1 billion from $13.3 billion this year, with new orders 13 percent ahead of 1989 for the first nine months.
Aerospace systems also had higher profits in the quarter, but the gains were tied to higher revenues that reflected the timing of product deliveries rather than underlying strength, the company said.
 
Financial Services Gain
G.E.'s financial services reported a 19 percent gain in profits for the quarter, which the company attributed to the activities of the General Electric Capital Corporation, a subsidiary that provides financing and credit for a wide range of industrial and consumer activities. ''The fact that the financing company is contributing a growing share of earnings and that they continue to make acquisitions worries some investors,'' said Mr. Leavitt of Salomon Brothers.
Analysts said that the Kidder, Peabody Group, the securities firm that is 80 percent owned by General Electric, had a flat quarter. A company spokesman declined to comment.
G.E. also declined to elaborate on the performance at NBC, which suffered an unspecified ''modest'' fall in revenues and operating profits. ''I think NBC is doing O.K.,'' said Martin Sankey, who follows G.E. for First Boston. ''Prime time ratings are down but so are expenses.''
Mr. Welch did not comment on the fourth-quarter outlook directly, but concluded that General Electric expected 1990 to end up as the company's fourth straight year of double-digit increases in earnings per share.

HEADLINE: Professors With Influence Far Beyond Their Schools

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:

Harry M. Markowitz
City University of New York
By many accounts, Harry M. Markowitz, professor of finance at Baruch College of the City University of New York, is the gentlest of the three recipients of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science, and perhaps the most scholarly.
His colleagues at Baruch talk of his ''intellectual fervor'' and bookishness. And Fisher Black, a former finance professor now applying Dr. Markowitz's theories at Goldman, Sachs, tells of how he reversed himself after Dr. Markowitz, with great courtesy, poked holes in a paper that Mr. Fisher had written.
The paper called for automated, computerized stock trading, in lieu of the present exchanges. But after a cross-examination from Dr. Markowitz, Mr. Black reversed his conclusion, rewriting the paper and endorsing the exchanges. 
At age 63, Dr. Markowitz still teaches graduate students three days a week at Baruch, and this semester he is a lecturer at the University of Tokyo - his first big foray abroad. He is to follow that with a teaching stint at the London School of Economics.
Dr. Markowitz first developed his portfolio investment theories in his 1955 Ph.D. dissertation at the University of Chicago.
He has taught since 1982 at Baruch and now also works as a consultant to Daiwa Securities, the Japanese investment house. Before Baruch, he had worked at the Rand Corporation and was an I.B.M. researcher, developing Simscript, a computer language used to write programs for economic analyses.
 
Merton H. Miller
University of Chicago
The time was early 1958. Merton H. Miller, a young professor at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh, was sitting in the back of a classroom, auditing a lecture by a colleague, Franco Modigliani, when Dr. Modigliani started to discuss issues Dr. Miller had been trying to investigate.
''I had collected some data,'' Dr. Miller recounts, ''but had no theory to serve as a framework, and he had some theory.''
The two professors had adjoining offices and were soon exploring the topic in daily discussions. Their first pioneering paper appeared a few months later, and took them a distance from their starting point. Pushing aside debt and stock outstanding as the key to a corporation's value, they concluded that what really counted were the skills of a company's managers and how much cash plants and equipment generate.
Such a conclusion might seem obvious today, notes Dr. Miller, who is now 67, but in 1958 - when companies seemed to earn money without great regard to operating strategy - the Miller-Modigliani thesis was counterintuitive and produced enormous debate.
The son of a Boston lawyer, Dr. Miller graduated from Harvard University in 1944, worked as a tax expert at the Treasury Department and enrolled at John Hopkins University to earn a Ph.D. in economics.
He went on to Carnegie-Mellon, and eight years later, in 1961, moved to his present post. In Chicago, he has emerged in a new role - as a consultant and director of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and a staunch defender of the exchange's trading in stock-index futures.
 
William F. Sharpe
Stanford University
The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science comes to William F. Sharpe when he is more or less retired from teaching but, at age 56, very much engaged in practicing the theories for which he was honored yesterday.
Dr. Sharpe had elaborated on the earlier work of his mentor, Harry Markowitz, who also won a Nobel yesterday. While Dr. Markowitz focused on how investors evaluate risk and reward in trading portfolios, Dr. Sharpe explained how markets actually moved as investors made their decisions.
Today, as the chief executive of William F. Sharpe Associates - his wife, Kathryn, is the administrator -he applies his findings as a consultant to various pension funds.
Dr. Sharpe was a 27-year-old Ph.D. candidate at the University of California at Los Angeles, working on the side at the Rand Corporation, when he first met Dr. Markowitz, a fellow Rand employee. The entrepreneurial Dr. Sharpe persuaded the economics department to let Dr. Markowitz be the mentor for his dissertation, although he was not connected with U.C.L.A.
Three years later, as a professor at the University of Washington in Seattle, Dr. Sharpe published the lengthy paper with the findings and conclusions, now known as the Capital Asset Pricing Model, for which he has won the Nobel.
From the University of Washington, Dr. Sharpe went briefly to the University of California at Irvine and in 1971 to Stanford University, where he is professor emeritus of finance. And through most of those years, he refined his original findings - although the 1987 stock market crash shook his confidence.
''My theory assumes that at any given time, market prices reflect investors' opinions of the future course of the economy,'' Mr. Sharpe said. ''The crash certainly raises serious questions about the efficiency of the markets.''

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Contrarian Bets On Soviet Future

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
THERE have been shortages from cigarettes to bread. The troubled Government is still seeking the right plan for a quick, but still painful, transition from the centrally run Communist economy to a market system. And the staying power of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, despite his Nobel Peace Prize, is in doubt.
But Batterymarch Financial Management, an investment management company known for the contrarian views of its founder, Dean LeBaron, still thinks this is the right time to bet as much as $1 billion on the future of emerging companies in the Soviet Union. So with an official backdrop provided by the auditorium of the Soviet Mission to the United Nations in New York, Mr. LeBaron and Vladimir F. Petrovsky, the Deputy Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union, announced the start of the Soviet Companies Fund yesterday. 
The fund, which will charge up to 2 percent in marketing and management fees, is the first such Soviet investment vehicle, Mr. LeBaron said. But the fund is also another in a growing list of approaches to the economic opportunities that promoters see in the Soviet Union and in Eastern and Central Europe. There have probably been more announcements than actual investments so far. And given the risks involved in ventures where both the governments and economies are moving into untraveled territory, all the investments face some real problems.
In the case of the Soviet Companies Fund, the initial investment appears to be an attractive way for a large corporation to get a small piece of the Soviet future. Unlike a joint venture, there is not the difficult process of choosing the right mate. But the longer-term bet is dicey. Getting the investment out depends on the development of a liquid Soviet stock market relatively quickly and an appetite for Soviet stocks both in the Soviet Union and abroad.
Mr. LeBaron acknowledges the risk but is not deterred. His answer sounds like a contrarian's mantra. ''Many good investments are made when there is public skepticism,'' he said. ''By the time the skepticism is gone, often the opportunity has passed. This is the contrarian idea.''
The fund, which hopes to raise $400 million to $1 billion, is only for big corporate investors who may have a long-term interest in joint ventures and want to have access to developing Soviet technology. The investors will be limited to 20 companies with a minimum investment of $20 million. Mr. LeBaron, who is beginning the solicitation process, is looking for investments from companies like Raytheon, Lockheed, Bechtel Power and others around the world.
The targets in the Soviet Union are the technologically advanced military contractors that are now beginning the transition to civilian and consumer production. Mr. Petrovsky said the Government wanted the conversion process to focus on food processing, retail trade and catering services, communications, including radio and televison broadcasting, civilian ships and aircraft and environmental protection. Mr. LeBaron is also interested in pharmaceuticals, chemicals, optics and the commercial use of space.
The fund, which would hold only 2 percent to 5 percent stakes in these Soviet companies, would not get the investing companies as involved in the Soviet Union as a joint venture. It would allow them to survey the opportunities in Soviet technology. With this introduction - and the knowledge gained through their part ownership - they could decide on joint ventures in the future.
After three years the Soviet Companies Fund would be dissolved, leaving the investing companies with the choice of holding their stock in the Soviet companies or selling out. But this could be difficult if the hoped for Soviet stock market is still underdeveloped and the Soviet ruble is still relatively unconvertible.
Mr. LeBaron said the money he raises would depend on the outlook for the new Soviet economic plan, which is being hammered out in Moscow right now, and the chances for convertibility of the ruble. The more uncertain the outlook, he added, the less he will be able to raise.
But he is not worried about convertibility or about the future of the stock market or the economic plan. ''We don't know the answer to those questions,'' he said. ''Nor do I want this fund to stop and do nothing until we do.'' In fact, he hopes that the fund itself will help force some answers to these questions sooner rather than later.
This comment points to the less-talked-about motive that many backers of such investments have. The Soviet-American flag pins in the lapels of the Americans at the news conference yesterday seemed to signal an extra commitment to the successful economic and political development of the glasnost and perestroika Mr. Gorbachev began. And Mr. LeBaron will probably have to find the same sympathy in his potential investors for the fund to be successful.

HEADLINE: Dow Drops by 35.15, Despite Late Rally

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stocks fell sharply yesterday as oil prices rose, but rallied slightly in the final 15 minutes on a report that President Saddam Hussein of Iraq might accept a diplomatic solution to the gulf crisis.
After two days of gains that lifted the market 51 points, the Dow Jones industrial average slid 35.15, to 2,381.19, recovering a few points in the final quarter-hour. Birinyi Associates, which monitors program trading, said that heavy program selling knocked the Dow down close to 49 points.
Analysts and economists also began saying cautiously that the bear market could be coming to an end. 
''There's a major bull market going to unfold,'' said David B. Bostian Jr., chief economist for the investment firm of Jesup, Josephthal & Company, ''probably in 1991.'' He said he had advised clients ''to cut cash levels to the minimum and invest in high-quality bonds and stocks.'' Beginning of the End? ''You're looking at a wounded bear,'' said Ronald J. Hill, investment strategist for Brown Brothers, Harriman. ''The beginning of the end of a bear market comes when bond prices perform better than stocks, as they have since Sept. 25. That's generally the first step. The next requires greater investor confidence and that's the hang-up right now,'' Mr. Hill continued. ''They have to step up to the plate and buy stock.''
He argued that continuing uncertainty about the budget and the Iraqi crisis ''are holding people back,'' but that ''if we get a positive resolution on those, it'll be much easier for people to come in and buy.''
Trading volume slumped to 149.6 million shares, from 165 million Monday, as 1,077 shares dropped in price and an unsettling 276 fell to new lows. Only five touched new highs and 487, or less a fourth of the total, rose in price.
 
Near Certainty on Fed
Mr. Bostian of Jesup, Josephthal argued that ''it's almost certain that the Fed is going to ease monetary policy in a matter of days because a budget accord is expected in a matter of days.''
A budget agreement seemed close indeed. After the market closed, the White House said President Bush had canceled a trip to Cincinnati, were he was to attend the second World Series game, so that he could monitor the budget talks in Washington.
Mr. Bostian also said that ''the probabilities are fairly high that the Middle East crisis will be resolved in a month or so.''
''You can't be sure if it's war or peace,'' he said, ''but it's another positive because even if it's war, it could be decisive fairly quickly.''
As a result, he said, ''One should be focusing on the stock and bond market to rally in the near future.''
 
No 'Follow-Through'
But Peter G. Grennan, head of stock index futures for Shearson, Lehman Brothers, said: ''In the last six weeks, there hasn't been a rally where the market's been up more than twice in a row. That means there's no follow-through. Traders can't get any conviction that we've seen the lows for the year.''
In a sign, however, that traders were prepared to believe good news from almost anywhere, the stock market turned up a bit in the last 15 minutes - after four hours of weakness - when a news report from Bonn said Iraq might be willing to accept mediation to end the gulf crisis.
The report said reporters had gotten that impression after interviewing Dieter Schinzel, a German deputy in the European Parliament and a member of the opposition Social Democrat Party.
 
Busy Day for Shorts
Earlier in the day, crude oil declined, bonds rallied and stocks followed. Speculators who had sold short rushed to buy back stock before it rose further. When the rally faded, the short sellers sold stock short again, driving down the market.
By the end of the session, crude rose 94 cents a barrel, to $38.89; bonds rose sharply, yields on 30-year bonds fell to 8.88 percent, and stocks stood 619 points, or 21 percent, away from their all-time high in mid-July.
Amid concern about the state of many American banks, Citicorp, the biggest banking company, topped the Big Board active list falling 1 1/8, to 13, with 3.6 million shares changing hands. It said third-quarter earnings per share fell 43 percent largely because of provisions for poor real estate loans.
Nynex, the phone company, fell 3 7/8, to 72 7/8, after administrative judges of the New York Public Service Commission recommended smaller rate increases than it had requested.
General Electric reported a small rise in profits but the stock fell 2 7/8, to 51 1/2, on concern about future quarters. PPG Industries, the glass and chemicals company, fell 3 3/4, to 34 5/8, after a new low of 34 1/2.
Student Loan Marketing, known as Sallie Mae, fell 6 5/8, to 36 1/2, in heavy trading. The F.B.I. said it was investigating allegations that Sallie Mae bought canceled loans to inflate its assets; Sallie Mae called the charges, from two former employees, ''without merit.''

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Late Rally Lifts Treasury Issues

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
A late rally pushed up prices of Treasury securities and moved interest rates lower at the end of a generally slow session yesterday.
Traders said the spurt had much to do with yesterday's slide in stock prices, particularly bank stocks. To credit market participants, the drop in the price of bank shares, prompted in large part by weak third-quarter earnings, gave added weight to comments made earlier in the day by Martha Seger, a Federal Reserve Board Governor.
Speaking in Washington, Ms. Seger said that the Fed's move in July to lower interest rates had not completely offset the tightening of credit conditions in the financial sector. 
Traders interpreted those comments as suggesting that Ms. Seger and others at the Fed favor moving interest rates lower now rather than waiting for a budget package to be approved by Congress and the President.
''The argument about the fragility of the financial system gained some credence after the bank earnings came out,'' said James R. Capra, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities. ''That caused some portfolio managers to buy some bonds.''
The fact that budget votes in both the House and Senate appeared likely last night, signs that the process is moving forward, also helped the bond market, participants said.
 
Further Drop in Gold Price
Prices were also helped by a further drop in gold prices and more Middle East peace rumors.
A sharp drop in the dollar, which fell to new lows against the German mark, and a rise in oil prices contributed to a drop in prices early in the session. But those negative factors were largely forgotten as the day wore on.
Traders and analysts said they did not attach much significance to yesterday's price action.
''The market is frozen, and the Fed is frozen'' until something happens in the Middle East or on the budget in Washington, said Kristen Foster, a financial market economist at Citicorp Investment Bank.
Under current circumstances, ''positions in short-term securities look pretty safe,'' Ms. Foster said, ''because the likelihood of a rise in short-term rates is very low. But the long end is a very scary place to be because of what could happen in the Middle East and on the budget front.''
 
Bonds Post Biggest Gains
Despite those risks, bond prices posted the biggest gains.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 98 19/32, up 1/2 point, or $5 for each $1,000 face amount of securities, to yield 8.88 percent. Late Monday, the bellwether issue was offered at a price to yield 8.93 percent.
Among note issues, the 8 3/4 percent 10-year notes were offered at 100 3/32 late yesterday, up 1/4 point, to yield 8.73 percent. And the price of the 8 1/2 percent five-year notes rose by 1/8 point, to 100 17/32, to yield 8.35 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates dipped slightly.
By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.15 percent, down one basis point, or one one-hundredth of a percentage point. Six-month bills fell by two basis points, to a late offered rate of 7.18 percent.
During the afternoon, the Treasury said that if a budget was passed in time it intends to increase the size of next week's bill auction to a record $19.2 billion, from $18.8 billion.
Activity in the tax-exempt municipal bond market was highlighted by a competitive sale of $327 million bonds for the Florida State Board of Education.
A bid from a group led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets won the issue, which consists of serial and term bonds.
Maturities on the serial bonds run from 1990 to 2013, with coupons ranging from 5.90 percent to 7.40 percent in 2013.
A term bond maturing in 2020 carries a coupon of 7.45 percent.
The securities are rated AA by both Moody's Investors Service and by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
In the secondary market for municipal bonds, traders said that the increasing likelihood of Federal tax rises and a trickle of new tax-exempt issues helped to push up prices of most widely quoted bonds by about 1/4 point.
Traders in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds said prices of most issues were unchanged to up about 1/4 point in very thin trading.
The drop in stock prices had little adverse impact in the high-yield ''junk bond'' market, participants said. Prices of most issues dipped by 1/4 point to 3/8 point in slow trading.
''People were not motivated to be aggressive buyers or sellers'' yesterday, one trader said.

HEADLINE: Revenue Bonds For Illinois Project

 BODY:
The Village of Hoffman Estates in Cook and Kane Counties in Illinois has tentatively priced $111.5 million in tax-increment revenue bonds through underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs & Company.
The financing, for a Hoffman Estates economic development project, is backed by a letter of credit issued by the Union Bank of Switzerland through its Chicago branch office. The letter supporting the financing is good for seven years.
For serial bonds with shorter maturities in the pricing, yields range from 6.50 percent due in 1994 to 7.35 percent in 2000 and 7.65 percent in 2003. Investors interested in a longer maturity were offered a 7.625 percent bond due in 2009 priced at about 97.306, to yield 7.90 percent.
Because of the letter of credit, underwriters expect the issue to be rated Aaa by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and AAA by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Low Against Mark; Strength Is Shown by Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar sank on foreign exchange markets yesterday, reaching new lows against the German mark and tumbling against the Japanese yen.
Traders cited economic difficulties in the United States as the reason for the dollar's slide. They pointed in particular to the Government report on housing starts expected today and tomorrow's report on September consumer prices, which are expected to show a further economic weakening and higher inflation. 
The dollar has been under a strain in recent weeks amid speculation that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates to revive a slowing economy, a development that would make the dollar less attractive to foreign investors.
Tim Barton, an assistant vice president at the Chicago-based Harris Trust and Savings Bank, said the dollar ''doesn't seem to have much of a bounce,'' and that there are no signs of a willingness to step in and support the currency.
Against the German currency, the dollar fell in New York to a new low of 1.5115 marks, down from 1.5262. That was its lowest level since the mark was created in 1948.
In New York, the dollar slid to its lowest point since January of 1989, settling at 126.79 yen, down from 127.73 yen on Monday. Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar had fallen 0.10 yen, to a closing 128.05 yen. In London, it was quoted at 127.20 yen.
In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.9575, compared with $1.9545 late Monday. In New York it cost $1.9655 to buy 1, more expensive than Monday's $1.9498.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's rates, included: 1.2770 Swiss francs, down from 1.2905; 5.0660 French francs, down from 5.1120; 1,132.75 Italian lire, down from 1,143.00, and 1.1564 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1540.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates Monday, included: 1.2780 Swiss francs, down from 1.2870; 5.0732 French francs, down from 5.1035; 1.7070 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7165; 1,134.25 Italian lire, down from 1,141.50, and 1.1551 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1520.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Gold Prices Plummet Again On Mine Companies' Woes

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Gold prices dropped again yesterday, with the latest burst of selling attributed largely to mining companies that are selling future bullion output because of their increasing inability to obtain bank financing.
At the close on the Commodity Exchange in New York, the major gold and silver futures market, the spot October gold delivery settled at $362 an ounce, down $13 on the day. This returned the price of gold to where it was before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 sent precious metal prices soaring. 
Other futures contracts, including grains, oilseeds, livestock and coffee, also declined. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of futures prices, a barometer of inflation and general economic trends, continued to fall. Despite rising oil and byproduct costs, the index of 21 basic farm and industrial commodities slipped 1.18, to 230.92 - with 100 equal to the index in 1967.
It was the index's lowest level since July 20, when it stood at 230.30, reflecting excellent crop prospects, declining industrial demand for raw materials and weak energy prices. But it turned upward after the run-up in oil prices from the Middle Eastern crisis renewed inflation fears.
Unsubstantiated rumors that banks are having difficulty collecting on outstanding loans to domestic and foreign gold producers also weighed on the silver and platinum markets.
''With shares in gold mining companies falling with bullion prices and many banks facing their own liquidity problems, we expect that many cash-short producers will be forced to sell or swap anticipated output for cash,'' said William B. O'Neill, senior futures market strategist with Merrill Lynch Futures Inc.
Steven J. Pepper, senior vice president at the Republic National Bank of New York, said bids for gold had been reduced overnight in foreign markets, mainly as Monday's drop of $12.50 an ounce in New York inspired selling in those markets.
''The market appeared to stabilize when we opened our books about 7:30 this morning,'' Mr. Pepper said. ''Then the bids for gold began to shrink. To make matters worse, the commodity funds began unloading metals in the last 45 minutes of Comex trading.''
Comex spot October silver closed at $4.142 an ounce, up a cent on what dealers said was hedge buying by some gold traders.
But the spot October platinum contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange dropped a further $5.60 an ounce, to $388.50, bringing the two-day loss to $28.40.

HEADLINE: Profits Up at Microsoft and Down at Lotus

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 16

 BODY:
The Microsoft Corporation today reported strong gains in revenues and earnings, while the Lotus Development Corporation reported declining earnings on essentially flat sales, which it attributed to upgrading its most popular product.
The company's stocks moved in seemingly unexpected directions. Microsoft shares closed at $54.625, down $1.875, in heavy over-the-counter trading, while Lotus gained $1.625, to $14.375. 
The price of Lotus was apparently helped by two company announcements. Lotus said it expected a big increase in profits in the fourth quarter and it planned to repurchase up to five million shares of its outstanding common stock, or approximately 12 percent of its 43 million shares outstanding.
Commenting on the market's negative reaction to Microsoft's positive results, David Readerman, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers in San Francisco, said: ''No one believes the 'e' in earnings-per-share growth stories anymore. People are questioning what personal computer growth rates will be next year.''
For its third quarter ended Sept. 30, Microsoft reported earnings of $87.6 million, or 71 cents a share, up 76 percent from $49.6 million, or 43 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenues rose 57 percent, to $369.4 million, from $235.2 million in the third quarter of 1989.
''We were particularly pleased with the strong demand for Windows 3.0 and applications products for the Windows 3.0 environment during the quarter,'' Michael Hallman, Microsoft's president and chief operating officer, said in a statement. Windows 3.0 is a software program that gives I.B.M.-compatible PC's much of the ease of use of Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh.
Lotus reported third-quarter earnings of $8.6 million, or 20 cents a share, less than half the $23 million, or 54 cents a share, it earned in the comparable period last year. Revenues rose 2 percent, to $157.4 million, from $153.9 million in the third quarter of 1989.
''While the quarter was negatively affected by the transition to 1-2-3 Release 3.1 from 3.0, we are encouraged by initial marketplace response to the product,'' Jim Manzi, the president and chief executive of Lotus, said in a statement.
Should sales of 1-2-3 Release 3.1, the latest version of the company's accounting spreadsheet software, remain strong, and barring a major downturn in the economy, Lotus expects a significant increase in its profitability in the fourth quarter, the company said.

Top Executive Ousted At New Haven Register

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES

 BODY:
The top executive at The New Haven Register was dismissed Monday night by the paper's owner, the Journal Register Company, after he resisted the second round of layoffs in a month, reportedly on the ground that they would seriously damage the newspaper.
Journal Register is a holding company owned by E. M. Warburg, Pincus & Company, a New York investment company that was in partnership with Ralph Ingersoll Jr. until they divided their newspapers earlier this year. The Register and the other Ingersoll papers in the United States went to Warburg while Mr. Ingersoll kept the British papers. 
Robert M. Jelenic, president of Journal Register, based in Princeton, N.J., said the layoffs were ''just prudent business'' prompted by declining revenues. He said he the paper would not be seriously hurt.
''The paper is very strong,'' Mr. Jelenic said.
Thomas P. Geyer, who was dismissed by Mr. Jelenic as The Register's chief executive, declined to discuss his opposition to the layoffs.
But a Register executive who spoke on condition of anonymity said that Mr. Geyer had expressed concern that the paper's news coverage in the suburbs and ability to maintain the paper's delivery standards were in jeopardy.
The executive said Mr. Geyer had also felt that The Register was being forced to generate excessive profits to provide money to meet debt payments on about $200 million owed from the paper's purchase. Last year, Mr. Ingersoll and Warburg paid Mark Goodson, the game show entrepreneur, a reported $245 million for The Register, which was considered a huge price at a time when New England was in an economic slump.
Mr. Jelenic said the debt, which he declined to quantify, had played no role in his decision to order 31 layoffs yesterday and 19 on Oct. 3.
David J. Butler, editor of The Register, said that nine full-time members of the news staff and one freelancer were laid off yesterday, and nine full-time and two part-time members of the news staff were laid off Oct. 3. At the end of 1988, when the New Haven economy was booming, the news staff was 151; it is now 108.
''I don't think the layoffs jeopardize the news coverage, but they hurt news coverage somewhat,'' said Mr. Butler, who added that such projects as the study of race relations in New Haven were the kind of luxuries that would have to be sacrificed.
The Register has circulation of 105,000 daily and 140,000 Sunday, the Audit Bureau of Circulations says.
Mr. Goodson bought The Register in 1986 for about $185 million. Mr. Ingersoll had a longstanding agreement to manage Mr. Goodson's papers. Mr. Geyer, who was the top operating officer for all Ingersoll papers, decided to concentrate on The Register.

HEADLINE: Mr. Dinkins Faces Fiscal Reality

 BODY:
Mayor David Dinkins and his advisers have finally awakened to reality. By ordering New York City agencies to plan for cuts of more than $1 billion, they are beginning to acknowledge the depth of the city's economic problems. At the same time, though, City Hall has saddled itself with an imprudent labor settlement that urgently needs to be modified.
The settlement reached with the teachers' union for a 5.5 percent salary increase is not only too generous; it forces other union leaders to demand equivalent deals. As the new service cuts so starkly dramatize, the city cannot afford increases like that. To demand sacrifice from the public, while giving generous pay increases to municipal workers, amounts to paying for those increases with cuts in city services.
As worthy as teachers are of raises, the settlement with the United Federation of Teachers was a mistake. The city can avoid compounding it now by rolling back all or part of the contract, and by slowing down its negotiations with the other unions.
The Board of Education, scheduled to vote on the contract next Wednesday, can delay that vote at least until the city modifies its financial plan early next month. In the interim, the city can get an independent analysis of a questionable part of the contract - the plan to reduce the city's contribution to its teacher pension fund by changing the fund's earnings assumption. The savings are supposed to pay for 2.5 points of the raise. Moreover, if the city can save on its pension contribution, the money could do more good going into the city treasury - and reducing service cuts for all New Yorkers.
The next several days of labor negotiations could be crucial to the city's financial future. If other unions get settlements equivalent to the U.F.T. contract, the new service cuts will barely begin to deal with the cost. The more the unions get, the more the Dinkins administration will have to cut programs and tax the public. In fact, with the economy worsening, there's a good chance that the city will have to lay off members of the very same unions that are on the verge of getting raises.
Finally, fortunately, the Dinkins administration is starting to show some common sense. If it continues, by slowing down its labor negotiations and doing whatever possible to roll back the U.F.T. contract, New York may yet be able to respond to fiscal strain reasonably and not ruinously.

HEADLINE: U.S. Sealift Deficiencies Exposed in Gulf Crisis

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The crisis in the Middle East has generated renewed criticism of United States maritime policy (or lack of it) as evidenced by the paucity of useful U.S.-flag sealift capacity to move an American expeditionary force and its materiel overseas, and the consequent reliance on foreign tonnage to do the job.
In early August, at the outset of the White House response to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, United States maritime unions were told to bend every effort to man the ships that were to be broken out of reserve to supply a field army in Saudi Arabia. Some 40 or more of these ships were activated and manned by seagoing union personnel.
The unions were also told to be prepared to man additional vessels on short notice, to scour the waterfront for qualified people, even to recruit pensioned seamen who were physically capable of cutting it at sea. The union response, as in past conflicts, was prompt and effective.
But few additional ships have materialized as the Navy has judged the reserve fleet inventory unequal to the task. These ships, many of World War II vintage, are slow, mechanically unreliable, rigged with archaic cargo gear and generally ill suited to rapid deployment to destinations of opportunity. Senator Ernest Hollings, chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, said last month that so many reserve fleet vessels were forced into Spanish ports after the Atlantic crossing that ''it looked like we were invading Spain.''
Rather than resort to these reserve fleet relics, the Navy culled American and foreign merchant fleets to find more suitable tonnage and found few U.S. vessels that could be diverted to military supply without disrupting essential commercial operations. The neglect of our ''fourth arm of defense'' over the years has left the remaining U.S. operators with a minimum number of vessels to service their trade routes. Result: the U.S. is forced to rely on foreign countries to supply its armed forces.
The Navy's Military Sealift Command said last month that 35 of the 50 ships thus far chartered to the sealift are flying foreign flags. The ''ship of choice'' for Operation Desert Shield is the roll-on, roll-off vessel. All 17 of this type vessel in the reserve fleet have been activated and the Navy has had to look abroad for additional tonnage. This problem will become more acute as the Kuwaiti stalemate continues or escalates.
Repeated admonition to the Administration and Congress has failed to stem the erosion of America's maritime base priorities. Farm and other vested interests have fought all attempts to regain America's historical status as a major sea power. Such self-serving tactics place the national security in most serious jeopardy; endorsement of this distorted triage is tantamount to a dereliction of duty in those who are sworn to ''provide for the common defense.''
Ignoring history's lessons carries its much-vaunted peril, of course, but there is no law of man or nature that says we absolutely must repeat our mistakes. ''The obvious point,'' said Robert W. Kesteloot, a former Navy official, ''is that if we had a robust U.S.-flag merchant marine, we would not have to rely on foreign shipping as we are currently forced to do.''
This self-evident position is being echoed through a wide spectrum of the national forum as renewed debate on the sealift has been triggered by the shortcomings made manifest in the Persian Gulf crisis.
A ready reserve fleet in activeservice, out at sea, contributing to America's economy as well as its defense, is far preferable to a muster of ancient hulks gathering rust and expense in some maritime boneyard.
A United States-flag reserve fleet, chartered and operated by American steamship companies, manned by American seamen and hauling a far greater share of American cargo than the ''normal'' 3 or 4 percent, would be a viable asset to the country, able to discharge its military obligations in times of emergency, reduce the enormous United States balance-of-payments deficit, provide employment for its citizens, and once again show the flag around the world.

HEADLINE: Why Puerto Ricans Want Statehood

 BODY:
To the Editor:
A House panel's approval of a bill authorizing a referendum on Puerto Rico's status (news article, Sept. 28) correctly states that Puerto Ricans on the island now favor statehood. It was indicated that ''statehood at this point appears to be preferred, primarily because it would mean greater economic aid for the island's residents and give Puerto Ricans, who already have United States citizenship, full political representation . . .''
True, dissatisfaction with colonial status is behind the preference for statehood. But the prospect of more government aid has not played a major role. A poll conducted by Dr. Frank I. Luntz & Associates and sponsored by El Mundo newspaper and Channel 40 of Puerto Rico proves the point. Puerto Ricans were asked to rank seven issues related to the upcoming referendum in order of importance to them. ''More assistance from the Federal Government'' ranked last. The issue that ranked first had to do with which status ''would provide more employment opportunities.'' The right to vote for President and Congress ranked a close second.
Your article is one of several that have cited an increase in financial aid as the main reason Puerto Ricans prefer statehood. The value Puerto Ricans attach to their attainment of greater job opportunities has been glossed over or missed altogether. This is not a trivial fact. Puerto Ricans are the poorest minority in the United States, and many have taken this to mean we do not have a strong work ethic.
The poll findings suggest that to conclude Puerto Ricans are the poorest group in the United States because we are ''lazy'' is simplistic and unfair. Other groups are more successful at least partly because they do not find themselves affected by the same complex interaction of historical, social, political and economic factors in which we find ourselves embedded.
Statehood means two main things: (1) more employment opportunities and (2) the end of 500 years of colonialism.

HEADLINE: ESSAY;
Tax Or Spend?

BYLINE: By William Safire

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
These are glory days for American democracy. Congress is in an uproar, the wavering White House is acquiring a new sense of direction, and the American voter may soon be treated to a real campaign.
The Democrats are acting like old-fashioned Democrats. ''Soak the rich'' - a phrase born in 1934 to blast F.D.R.'s embrace of Huey Long populism - is the new battle cry of suddenly unabashed liberals.
Having suckered President Bush into abandoning his no-tax firewall, Democrats have shifted the focus of the budget debate away from spending and onto the source of more taxes.
They call this ''the fairness issue.'' A central tenet of liberalism is government's guarantee that everyone, working or not, needy or not, is entitled to what politicians decide is a fair share of what the nation produces.
Republicans traditionally grumble that this classic, straightforward demagoguery encourages ''class warfare,'' turning rich against poor. They get defensive when charged with standing for vested property interests by opponents who claim to belong to ''the party of the people.''
But these self-conscious conservatives miss the point of politics in an age of affluence. The fairness issue has been turned on its head. Most people think of themselves as closer to being rich than to being poor, and consider it unfair to carry all those unproductive others on their backs.
When these more-rich-than-poor Americans utter such sentiments, old-fashioned liberals deride them not only for being selfish but racist to boot. This swells the ranks of conservatives, because most voters are not so motivated and resent politicians who make them feel guilty.
Therefore, Republicans should not fear class warfare; the almost-rich far outnumber the almost-poor, and most of the people in the middle tend to identify with the almost-rich, whom they want to become.
Moreover, most people now know that the target of taxers has to be the middle-class pocket; squeezing the richies may be egalitarian fun but is not where the big money is.
What happens if you surtax millionaire incomes by 10 percent and add a 10 percent tax on furs, boats and jewelry, as the House liberals suggested? The budget deficit might be reduced by 2 percent, not counting the losses to the Treasury of taxes from people prevented from selling luxury items.
The hidden tax increase in that liberal budget proposal is to reinstate ''tax bracket creep'' - using inflation to automatically increase tax rates. That's $36 billion out of middle-class pockets for one year's creep; prevent indexing for five years, as would surely follow, and you achieve the liberal dream of ''fairness'' - redistributing income on a grand scale.
The Republican President, chastened by a whopping drop in support after waffling on the central promise of his campaign, says he would veto that bill. That fat and easy target will never reach his desk; Senate Democrats are taking a slightly more sober route of taxing booze and gas.
But whatever budget the Democratic Congress passes, its philosophical approach to the deficit will be new taxes in this ''in'' year and pious promises of reduced rates of spending in the ''out'' years. Tax now, cut spending later.
This liberal approach will pass over the objections of most of the Republican minority in Congress. Such dissent is healthy; if it means that the Government shuts nonessential services for a while, that will dramatize the depth of disagreement and bring the voters to the polls.
The only way the minority will become a majority is to draw an issue of principle. Within the Administration, Mr. Bush's Stolypin, Jack Kemp, soldiers on in loyal silence, but in Congress, the Republican minority must hold the Bob Packwood line on tax rates and align itself with the majority opinion in the nation. Where will it all end? Isn't compromise the name of the game? The game's name is political purpose. Compromise should be struck after the will of the people has been expressed. Let Mr. Bush veto the taxation budget, let the Republicans uphold the veto, and let us use this election as a referendum on taxing vs. spending.
The current impasse is no cause for national embarrassment; on the contrary, it is the overdue surfacing of basic political difference.
A closed-down Government on Election Day would bring out anti-incumbent voters in force. Candidates, take your positions: tax and service reductions vs. tax and service increases. Duck that in your spots and feel the voter heat.

HEADLINE: For Adobe, Whether Humble or Fashionable, It's Mud to Mud

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LAS CRUCES, N.M., Oct. 15

 BODY:
It is the odd paradox of adobe that it serves at once as the fashionable choice of shelter for the rich in the American Southwest and as the promise for housing the poor in the third world. Common mud, or ''earthen architecture,'' to use the stiffer technical term, has come to the fore again as architects march backward in time in search of style and shelter.
An increasingly urgent question is how to preserve the relics of this primitive form of shelter, which grows so gracefully out of the earth from which it was dug, but which also melts when it rains, cracks when it heats and cools, flakes in the wind and shudders when the earth quakes.
Santa Fe sophisticates aside, more than 30 percent of the world's people still live in earthen homes, said Neville Agnew, scientific program director at the Getty Conservation Institute in Marina del Rey, Calif. The institute is a sponsor of the Sixth International Conference on the Conservation of Earthen Architecture here this week.
Not a few of the more than 300 participants who came from about 30 countries were surprised to learn from Richard Pieper, a New York architect, that many 19th-century homes in rainy upstate New York are really nothing more than bricks of mud beneath Greek Revival and Gothic Revival wooden skins.
That these houses could survive so long in such a hostile clime serves to underscore the versatility and durability of earthen architecture, often scorned in this and other parts of the world as a sign of poverty. But a new appreciation for its advantages over cement and wood is emerging: with foot-thick walls, an earthen home acts as a thermal stabilizer, damping daily temperature swings by keeping the warmth of the day at night and the cool of the night during the day.
Indeed adobe construction, which dates back 10,000 years, may serve mankind for centuries to come. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, looking forward to human colonization of the moon, has considered building structures there by filling bags with moon rocks and dust, and stacking them up.
For now, though, the economic crisis in poorer nations has drawn attention to mud. ''The housing problems of the Third World are such that we cannot ignore any technology,'' said Hugo Houben, a Belgian who is vice president of the International Center for Earth Construction in Grenoble, France. ''How are we going to build thousands of classrooms and hospitals?'' he said. ''We have got to revitalize local know-how and use it.''
It seemed both incongruous and fitting to hold the Adobe 90 conference in New Mexico, where multimillionaires live in splendid adobe-style mansions in Santa Fe only a few miles from primitive Pueblo Indian adobes that are still occupied nearly a millennium after their construction.
More than 500,000 Americans lived in 176,000 adobe homes in 1980, according to census figures, mostly in New Mexico, Texas, Arizona and California. About 1,500 new adobes are built annually. Given the labor involved, it is cheaper in this country to build a conventional home, but in drier parts of Africa, Asia and South America, mud is the cheapest and perhaps the only option for shelter.
Adobe is made by mixing clay, sand and silt and forming the mixture into bricks, which dry hard in the sun. In some countries the preferred technique is rammed earth, in which the mud mixture is piled into a wooden form that is removed when the mud is dry. In a third method, called puddling, layer upon layer of mud is applied by hand.
Sun-baked bricks are used in the American Southwest; asphalt or chemicals may be added to stabilize the mud. Sometimes straw is added to bind the mud and promote drying.
Adobes need much attention, especially after rains, but they hold up well if the roof and foundation are good. ''All it needs is a good hat and a good pair of shoes,'' said Paul G. McHenry Jr., an architect in Albuquerque.
But matters are far more complex when it comes to preserving archeological remains, all the more so because many earthen landmarks are still occupied. The ravages of time and neglect can be seen just 20 miles north of here in the remains of Fort Selden, a 19th-century Army outpost set in a clump of cottonwoods in the Mesilla Valley. The walls have crumbled, and only the outlines of the encampment can be discerned.
Nearby, 64 slabs of adobe stand on the parched desert floor like rows of ancient Mayan steles. They are part of two experiments in adobe conservation. On one side, Michael R. Taylor, an archeologist with the National Park Service, is trying different coatings, caps and foundations on 13 walls built five years ago, comparing their resistance to the elements with the resistance of a ''control'' wall that has had no special protection or treatment - ''amendments,'' as they say in the adobe game. These techniques are being explored as ways of preserving historic adobe buildings, but they might eventually be found useful in new construction.
Mr. Taylor has found, for example, that it does not help to top a wall with a cap of regular bricks overhanging the sides. A cap but serves only to dribble rainwater right into the mud, badly eroding the upper part.
Another concern is water entering from below by capillary action. No concrete apron or foundation has worked, Mr. Taylor said. ''We have not come up with anything better than keeping the water away with a good slope away from the walls.''
Nearby is a more elaborate experiment started two years ago by the Getty institute. Lined up in three rows, 51 test walls are subjected to a variety of stresses including spraying and wind. Each wall has a different protection, like a chemical treatment or a textile canopy, except for one control wall of adobe.
Mr. Agnew of the Getty institute said that injecting either of two chemicals into the walls proved highly effective in consolidating the adobe and retarding decay. These are alkylalkoxysilanes, similar to bathtub caulking, and diisocyanates, used in the manufacture of certain paints. These chemicals react with moisture and bind to the clay.
One of the test walls stands under a tentlike structure made of a special synthetic knitted cloth, dun colored to match the desert, originally developed for horticulture. The wall under this ''aerotextile'' will be examined for wear over the next year or so.
Another approach to preservation is to rebury excavated structures, so Mr. Agnew is also testing ''geotextiles'' to wrap around archeological materials to protect them from moisture, roots and insects until they are dug up again for study.
But debate rages among experts over the use of chemical or other irreversible preservation methods on archeological sites. ''To experiment on an object is a very serious thing; you can totally destroy it,'' said Alejandro Alva Balderrama, an architect with the International Center for the Study of the Restoration and Conservation of Cultural Property, an international agency in Rome.
He cited the case of earthen remains at Gela, in Sicily, that were destroyed because a plastic tent put up to protect them created an unexpected microclimate. He and other experts favor regular maintenance, by which new mud plaster is applied to shore up decaying structures.
Mr. Agnew of the Getty institute strongly dissents. Regular maintenance for occupied earthen structures like the casbahs of North Africa is appropriate, he argues, but not for abandoned old sites. ''After 100 years of mud repair, you don't have a historic object anymore,'' he says. ''If you can find the right chemical, combined with shelter, you can minimize damange to the historic fabric.''
If chemical treatments to preserve ancient earthen architecture are controversial, such constraints do not apply to new construction. The rub here is money. Mr. Houben of the Center for Earth Construction in Grenoble helps developing countries build housing. Mud and labor are cheap in those countries, but they cannot afford the stablizing chemicals. They must turn to local resources and know-how, he said, adding, ''What we stabilize with is gray matter, not cement.''

Presidential Popularity And the Role Of the Media

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
When a President's popularity goes into decline, he is not likely to blame either himself or the abstraction that politicians in their pious mood call ''the American People.'' To blame oneself, besides being hard on the ego, means giving grist to the opposition; to blame the American People may signify a death wish. So who does one blame? Why, naturally, the media, by which is mainly meant television.
In the interpretation that Vice President Dan Quayle advanced last Sunday on ''Face the Nation,'' as he was ducking Lesley Stahl's questions about Mr. Bush's changeability on the budget, much of the Administration's problem can be traced to the way Washington correspondents have been reporting the story; if only they got it right, the American People would understand that the President is consistency itself with no special solicitude for the rich.
How much of the blame or credit has television earned for the President's slippage? Not, in this viewer's estimate, all that much. Despite the reputation for liberal leanings of journalists in Washington and New York, they have proven themselves willing to pick on all residents of the White House, whatever the party label. (If John F. Kennedy got off easy, he owed it more to his camera-friendly style than to his politics.) Skepticism is in the nature of the job, and the President exists to be the national target for praise and censure. More often than not, however, journalists, like politicians, take their lead from the public. They pick up on inchoate dissatisfactions and then feed them back in a form that both confirms and exacerbates.
In the two issues that are now confounding the nation - the standoff on the budget and the facedown in the Middle East - television news was far from hasty in criticizing the White House. Quite the contrary. In the first days and weeks of the movement of American troops into Saudi Arabia, the emphasis was all on the nastiness of Saddam Hussein and Washington's brilliant success in rallying so many members of the United Nations against him. Mr. Bush was the hero of the hour, although he did not share credit with the media for his good marks in the polls.
The camera's concentration on the young Americans in the desert may have subdued public enthusiasm by bringing home to viewers the realization that these fresh-faced soldiers would be the first to die should war break out. But it was inevitable that as the weeks wore on, support for the exercise would wear down, and questions that went unasked in the first flush of patriotism would be heard. Officials on talk shows, compelled to react to inklings of impatience, as well as to President Hussein's threats of destruction, boasts of defiance, hints of compromise, began to seem vague and wishful.
It was also the President's bad luck that the effects of America's deployment in the Gulf were felt instantly in the form of higher gasoline prices. Here was another story that was made for television. Day after day, the news cameras were directed at the ever-rising figures on the pumps. Could the prices have gone up any faster, some viewers must have begun asking, if Iraq had been left to take over Kuwait? Was Kuwait worth $10 or $20 a week? Soon, the television stories about the misfortunes of Kuwaitis began to be accompanied by stories about the wealth and power of the country's ruling family.
To Mr. Bush's further misfortune, the already worrisome economic outlook, darkened by uncertainty in the Middle East, was brought to the center of attention by the budget fiasco. But here again, the television news programs and talk shows by no means leaped on the President early in the process. The negotiations were so secretive, the politicians so reticent that correspondents had trouble getting a line on what was happening; there was not much disposition to lay blame on anyone.
It was only after the weeks of negotiating came to nothing and the public exploded that network newshounds scented blood and headed yelping toward the White House. These days, anchors and correspondents permit themselves to refer to the President's flipflopping as an accepted fact rather than attributing it to some Democrat. Television started nothing, but it picked up fast on the national mood, just like the Democrats in Congress. That comes naturally to a mass medium, which is nourished by its umbilical link to its audience.
So to get back to those polls, Mr. Bush and Mr. Quayle are kidding themselves if they think they have been cooked by the tube. The television tube is a great reflector that catches the nation's passions and sends them back in brighter and hotter hues. Should a deal be struck on the budget or with Iraq, the President's curve will doubtless go up again, and he can count on being treated better on the airwaves.
The criticisms of the budget finaglings now heard on television and the developing sense of unease over Iraq in the nightly reports may have taken away a couple of points from the President's popularity, but for the root of the decline, he will have to look to the real world, to his own actions and to the American People.

HEADLINE: On the Fiscal Stage, Rohatyn's Star Dims Among His Old Fans

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
In New York City, certain word associations are inevitable: bagels, lox; Russian, Tea Room; fiscal crisis, Felix G. Rohatyn. As the city once again faces economic hard times, the eminent investment banker's predictions (dire) and remedies (bitter) have returned him to center stage. As one former City Hall official put it, somewhat sourly, ''The cat is back.''
But the man who once helped save the city from financial ruin is discovering that 1990 is not 1975. Some of the same people who turned to him in that crisis are now turning against him.
Yesterday he announced plans to resign at year's end as chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation. The corporation, a state watchdog agency established during the fiscal crisis to issue bonds on the city's behalf, was his platform for critiques of the city's financial strategy for the last 15 years. But now, he said, he is concerned that his persona has become too prominent in contract negotiations between the city and its unions. 
''By personalizing this thing, it gives people an excuse not to face reality,'' he said. ''It's not the unions vs. Felix Rohatyn, it's the unions versus the reality of the city's condition.''
Mr. Rohatyn left open the possibility that Gov. Mario M. Cuomo could persuade him to stay after the new year. ''He could lock me in a room,'' Mr. Rohatyn said, ''but all things being equal, my intention is to get out.''
Mr. Cuomo said yesterday, ''If I win on Nov. 6, I will go to him and say, 'Please stay.' ''
Mayor David N. Dinkins said that Mr. Rohatyn's departure was up to Mr. Rohatyn and the Governor, but that he expected Mr. Rohatyn to remain an adviser to his administration.
Mr. Rohatyn said the criticism by his sometime allies helped persuade him to announce his departure.
Where he once found esteem, he now finds silence, or worse. Mr. Dinkins has politely thanked him for his advice and then ignored it. Labor leaders have labeled him ''the enemy.''
Mr. Rohatyn, who has been critical of the city's handling of a financial crunch he anticipated more than a year ago and calls far more serious than that of 1975, finds himself cast no longer as mediator, problem-solver and disinterested statesman, but as the leading adversary of labor and City Hall. He does not like it. ''People get angry, and say 'Who the hell are you to tell us this, you're just wishing for a crisis so you can be back on the front page of The New York Times,' '' he said. ''I find that disconcerting.''
But Mr. Rohatyn is clearly not entirely comfortable with the prospect of leaving a platform that helped transform him from banker to leading public policy sage.
 
'Not Going to Retire'
In explaining on Friday that he had told Mr. Cuomo last summer of his desire to step down from the Municipal Assistance Corporation, Mr. Rohatyn took care to note that the city's precarious economy might oblige him to stay.
''I obviously am not going to retire, because I don't think that would be right,'' he said. ''If I am going to try and be helpful and effect change, I might as well do it from the platform that I have.''
Despite their attacks on Mr. Rohatyn, union leaders said yesterday that they were surprised by his announcement. ''I was stunned,'' said Barry Feinstein, the president of Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters who on Tuesday called Mr. Rohatyn ''the enemy'' of labor.
''I didn't expect Felix to be leaving office,'' he said.
Mr. Feinstein said he had no doubt that Mr. Rohatyn would leave, but some of the financier's own associates, as well as aides to Mr. Cuomo, said there was still a chance that Mr. Rohatyn could be coaxed into staying. Gary Fryer, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, said the Governor had told Mr. Rohatyn that he ''understood his feelings,'' but asked him for ''time to discuss this after the election.''
 
Shock at Some Unions
Mr. Dinkins has refrained from disagreeing publicly with Mr. Rohatyn, but he took issue with Mr. Rohatyn's assertion that the city should reconsider a new teachers contract, limit wage increases for other city unions and convene a special meeting of labor and business leaders and government officials to develop a financial strategy for the city. Such a move could symbolically suggest that City Hall could not solve the city's problems.
''All of these parties are involved, we consult them as we go,'' Mr. Dinkins said recently. ''Having these various elements at a single meeting is questionable. I am not prepared to discuss it right now.''
Labor leaders, outraged by Mr. Rohatyn's attack on the 5.5 percent salary increase recently negotiated for public school teachers, were more belligerent. ''He never even called me ahead of time to tell me what he is going to do, I was absolutely shocked,'' said Sandra Feldman, president of the United Federation of Teachers.
Victor Gotbaum, the former head of District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Muncipal Employees who was best man at Mr. Rohatyn's wedding, put the friendship forged in 1975 momentarily aside. ''In 1975 Felix was part of the solution, but now he is part of the problem,'' Mr. Gotbaum said.
Mr. Feinstein, another longtime friend of Mr. Rohatyn, grudgingly conceeded that Mr. Rohatyn's gloominess about the economy could bear out. ''Over the years, Felix has been wrong, wrong, wrong, but it may be that this is one in 15 crises that he's right about.''
 
Concerned About Layoffs
Mr. Rohatyn, who, as he did in 1975, has called for ''shared sacrifice,'' said he detected one important difference now from then. ''We had unions recognizing that there was a crisis and that they had to give something up,'' he said. ''Today, they clearly have no such impression.'' He said he was concerned that wage increases would inexorably lead to layoffs of city employees.
Mr. Rohatyn spoke with wry nostalgia of the ''crazy days'' when ''we were running the city from a table at Elaine's, with Woody Allen sitting at the next one.'' But he said he had no desire to resume so critical a role.
''I think you need someone who can wake up every morning and say this is my chance to be in the sunshine, and today I'm going to invent something new,'' he said, adding, ''I've been in the sunshine, and I'm not sure I can invent anything new.''
 
Took Off His Glasses and Fedora
Mr. Rohatyn, who vowed to speak out on fiscal matters as long as he is chairman of M.A.C., has not abandoned his other platforms. Mr. Rohatyn, a senior partner at Lazard Freres investment firm, is an adviser to Mr. Cuomo, and he lists Henry Kissinger and Francois Mitterrand among his many friends. He has written an article about the current economic slump for the Nov. 8 issue of The New York Review of Books, given speeches, appeared on television and made his advice available to Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Dinkins.
Norman Adler, a political consultant and former lobbyist for labor groups, was skeptical that Mr. Rohatyn would be content to sit this crisis out. ''If you don't want to be recognized as Superman, its easy: you don't take off your glasses and fedora,'' Mr. Adler said, adding, ''Felix hasn't seen his glasses and fedora for months.''
Few in New York felt that Mr. Rohaytn's threat to leave an institution whose powers were diminished when its surpluses were turned over to the city would significantly diminish his voice in matters of city or state. ''Even if he does step down, he won't be fading away,'' Mr. Adler said.
Mr. Rohatyn said as much himself. ''I will always be an adviser to the Governor,'' he said on Friday, ''whether I'm chairman of M.A.C. or sitting on my stoop in Southhampton.''

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET BATTLE;
BUDGET MEASURE CLEARS 2 HURDLES IN SENATE VOTES

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 17

 BODY:
After Senate leaders from both parties struggled all day to line up votes, their budget package passed its first critical tests late tonight.
The senators rejected a proposal to raise taxes on the wealthy, largely out of fear of a Presidential veto, and turned down an effort to scrap an increase in the gasoline tax.
The first votes seemed to have secured passage of the package, which would raise taxes on gasoline and other items and would cut Medicare and other benefits.
After Senate approval, which is expected Thursday, the budget legislation will go to a conference with the House, where senior lawmakers will try to resolve the differences in the two versions under the watchful eye of the White House.
The first proposal defeated tonight, by a vote of 67 to 32, was much like the measure passed by the House on Tuesday to put more of the burden of deficit reduction on the wealthy and less on the middle class. 
Then, the senators rejected an amendment favored by many Southern and Western senators of both parties that would have kept the Federal gasoline tax from being raised and would have meant that the overall package would have fallen short of the goal of $40 billion in deficit reduction this year and $500 billion after five years. The vote was 59 to 40.
Both votes came on parliamentary motions rather than on the substance of the issues in each measure, giving senators a way to support their leaders without directly voting down politically attractive measures.
The Senate was racing to beat a deadline, 48 hours away. The Government's authority to spend money lapses at midnight Friday, and President Bush has pledged to close down the Government again if no budget that satisfies him has been enacted by then. The first proposal, offered by Senators Kent Conrad of North Dakota and Max Baucus of Montana, received strong support from their fellow liberals. Like the House measure, it would have raised the top tax rate, placed a surtax on millionaires and increased the minimum tax paid by the wealthy.
Mr. Bush has said he would veto such a measure. John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, explained the President's position on higher taxes on the wealthy in a television interview today. ''Once they start playing with taxes at one end, they can't stop,'' he said.
 
Deflecting a Veto
The rejection of the Conrad-Baucus amendment came on a procedural vote after Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Democratic leader, said the certainty of a veto made Senate approval irresponsible.
Though Mr. Mitchell is himself a strong proponent of higher income tax rates, he told his colleagues: ''It is a question of whether we want to make a statement or make a law. Adoption will result in making a very strong statement but adoption of no law.''
Senator Conrad argued that a veto, and the resulting portrait of President Bush as a patron of the rich, would not be the worst outcome. ''It seems to me we ought to give the President that opportunity,'' he said.
Earlier, urging his colleagues not to change the bill that had been assembled compromise by compromise over many weeks by the Senate Finance Committee, Mr. Mitchell told the Senate: ''This is a test. This is a test for every senator. And ultimately, this is a test of our nation's future.
''Do we have the courage to do something that's difficult, that's unpleasant, that's unpopular? Can we not keep in mind the national interest?''
 
Opposition From Left and Right
Senator Mitchell's Republican counterpart, Bob Dole of Kansas, agreed that if the politically popular amendments were adopted, ''we might as well fold up our tent.''
But the leaders faced opposition from the left and right. Mr. Baucus declared, ''If we are going to raise taxes to address the deficit, the rich should pay their share.'' Senator Brock Adams, a Washington Democrat, agreed. ''We can no longer let the wealthy off scot-free,'' he said.
Senator Steve Symms, a conservative Republican from Idaho, led the fight to strip from the leaders' bill the part that would more than double the Federal gasoline tax. ''This is a good issue to draw the line on as to whether we want to raise taxes on the American people,'' Senator Symms said. Later, he added: ''Stop taxes. Freeze spending.''
 
A Vote for 'the Common Good'
But the leaders insisted that the yearlong effort to cut the deficit by the largest amount in history was doomed if the changes were made.
Senator Jim Sasser, the Tennessee Democrat who heads the Budget Committee, swallowed his personal enthusiasm for the Conrad-Baucus proposal, saying, ''I'm going to do it in the name of the common good, and the common good is reducing the deficit that is eating away at the vitals of the economy of the United States.''
And Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Democrat who is chairman of the Finance Committee, said his Texas constituents were adamantly opposed to a higher gasoline tax but added that he had to support one because ''the job we have to do is to make a critical cut in the deficits we are facing.''
Senator Dale Bumpers, an Arkansas Democrat who can occasionally swing votes with his eloquence, was enlisted by the leaders.
''I hate this,'' he began, saying that if a bill came out of a Senate-House conference with a large increase in the gasoline tax, he would vote against it. But approving a bill tonight, he said, would ''at least get us to conference.''
 
Shape of a Compromise
Already today, even before the Senate cast a vote, lawmakers were beginning to discuss the shape of a compromise.
A senior Republican Senator suggested that the White House and the Senate could probably accept an increase in the top tax rate to 31 percent. That is above the current 28 percent but below the 33 percent in the House bill. But the Senator said the 10 percent surtax in the House bill and the one-year delays in adjustments of tax brackets and personal exemptions for inflation would probably be dropped. Suspension of the inflation adjustment would cost middle-income families a few hundred dollars a year in extra income taxes.
A leading Democratic Representative suggested that House members could probably be persuaded to accept a higher gasoline tax, though not so large as the one in the Senate measure. He also said the House might back a provision in the Senate bill that would limit the deductions that could be claimed by affluent taxpayers.
Few taxes are so unpopular as gasoline taxes. According to the Highway User Federation, the average household pays about $3 a week in gasoline taxes. But the figure tends to be higher in the South and West, where public transportation is not available and where long distances must often be traveled to work and for routine chores. For a commuter with a 30-mile round trip, doubling the gasoline tax would cost about $1 a week.
''This is like a dagger in the heart of the poorest state in America, Mississippi,'' said Senator Trent Lott, a Mississippi Republican.
These are among the main elements of the Senate bill:
* An increase in the Federal gasoline tax to 18.5 cents in 1992 from 9 cents now.
* A doubling of the annual Medicare deductible, to $150. The monthly Medicare premiums the elderly pay for insurance against doctors' bills, now $28.60, would rise each year as medical costs increased.
* An increase to $89,000 from $51,300 in the amount of wages subject to the 1.45 percent payroll tax for Medicare.
* A 10 percent luxury tax on automobiles costing more than $30,000, boats costing more than $100,000, private planes costing more than $250,000 and furs and jewelry costing more than $5,000.
* Tax breaks totaling $3.5 billion over five years to encourage oil and gas production. They would not become effective unless the price of oil, now more than $40 a barrel, fell below $34.
* A limit on itemized deductions for affluent taxpayers. Taxpayers would have their deductions reduced by 5 percent of the amount their annual income exceeded $100,000.
* Requirements that all state and local employees pay Medicare taxes and that those not in a public employee retirement system pay Social Security taxes.
* Higher taxes on alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
* A $15 billion cut in agriculture programs, primarily price supports paid to farmers.
* An expansion of tax credits for poor workers.
The measure would also impose a variety of fees for Government services, including a charge for commercial use of data from the National Weather Service.

HEADLINE: House Openly Debates C.I.A. Aid in Angola

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 17

 BODY:
The House conducted a rare and bitter public debate today over a major Central Intelligence Agency program as critics of American-backed guerrillas in Angola sought unsuccessfully to end the agency's $60 million in annual support for the rebels.
By a vote of 246 to 175, the House rejected a measure by Representative Ronald V. Dellums, Democrat of California, that would have ended C.I.A. support of the Angolan rebels and forced the Bush Administration instead to detail the request for aid to Congress in public.
But the House later approved an amendment by Representative Stephen J. Solarz, Democrat of Brooklyn, that did restrict the Administration's options for future C.I.A. aid. The amendment, approved 213 to 200, would suspend military assistance to the rebels, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, or Unita, for three months once the Administration certifies that Angola's Government has agreed to a cease-fire, a political settlement with Unita, and the holding of elections within two years. 
Since 1985, the C.I.A. has provided increasing military aid to the rebels. The aid, which is approved by both intelligence committees of Congress, supports the rebels in a war against Angola's leftist Government, which lawmakers said today receives more than $500 million a year in aid from Moscow. Theoretically, the aid is classified, but the program is covert in name only.
The debate came as the House considered legislation that would allot about $30 billion for the new fiscal year for the C.I.A. and other intelligence agencies. Included in the bill is financing for rebels in both Angola and Afghanistan who are backed by the C.I.A. That bill later passed by a voice vote. ''The funding of Unita guerrillas is a cold-war anachronism,'' Mr. Dellums said. ''We are providing cold-war dollars that have wreaked incredible havoc on the people of Angola.''
Mr. Dellums and other backers of the amendment argued that the measure would not end aid to Unita, but would only force the Administration to make its case for the assistance in public.
But a coalition of liberals and conservatives who support the rebels asserted that the amendment would effectively kill the C.I.A.'s Angola program at the verge of success. Unita's leader, Jonas Savimbi, and officials of Angola's Government are reported to be near a cease-fire in their long war, with important details like the date of free elections still to be worked out.
Under the Solarz amendment, aid would remain suspended as long as this situation prevailed. But the aid would resume if the Angolan Government lagged in carrying out the agreement, broke the cease-fire or began stockpiling arms for an offensive.
The House bill goes to a conference committee, where its provisions will be melded with those of a similar bill that the Senate passed this summer.
The Senate bill is notable because it includes the first legal definition of so-called covert actions, easily the most controversial of the C.I.A.'s espionage duties.
The 1947 law that established the C.I.A. contained no explicit permission for the agency to conduct secret activities abroad other than collecting information. Over the years, Presidents and spymasters have interpreted that silence as a charter to wage paramilitary wars, run propaganda campaigns and even to overthrow other governments.
The Senate bill defines a covert action as an activity by the Government ''to influence political, economic or military conditions abroad so that the role of the United States Government is not intended to be apparent or acknowledged publicly.''
That definition includes operations conducted by agencies other than the C.I.A., in an attempt to prevent future scandals such as the Iran-contra affair, in which a guerrilla war against the Nicaraguan Government was managed largely from the White House. But it also excludes Federal law-enforcement activities overseas, espionage actions whose ''primary purpose'' is to gather intelligence, ''traditional diplomatic or military activities'' and routine support for publicly acknowledged Government programs.

HEADLINE: MIDEAST TENSIONS;
Soldiers Have Some Beefs for the Boss

BYLINE: By JAMES LeMOYNE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: IN SAUDI ARABIA, Oct. 17

 BODY:
The men of the headquarters supply platoon of the Second Squadron of the Army's Fourth Cavalry Regiment had a few things they wanted to get off their chests.
''Tell George Bush to get off the golf course and out of his fishing boat and come out here in the desert to take a look at what we're doing and drink some hot water with us,'' declared Pvt. Brett Thompson, 21 years old. ''We're tired of being kept in the dark like we don't have the intelligence to be told what's going on.'' 
It was only one of many heated comments by the mostly young enlisted men of this unit, which has been working an average 18 to 20 hours a day for the last two months.
''I had to come out here to find out what the Army really thinks I'm worth - nothing,'' said an angry private who asked not to be identified. ''Why is it that when the U.S. economy gets bad we always go to war?''
In shouted comments, more than a dozen soldiers in the unit complained of very slow mail, no news, no clear definition of their mission, few cots, no chance to telephone home, almost no recreational equipment and a feeling that senior commanders either do not listen or do not want to hear their complaints.
Although some soldiers said mail delivery had improved, it still seems slow and erratic. Pvt. John Barnes, 20 years old, said he had received no mail in more than a month.
Commanders said there are plans to install phones at a nearby town and to ferry troops to a beach resort for a break, but nothing seems definite yet.
''The longer we just sit here like this, the worse morale is going to get,'' said Sgt. Rolland Brooks, a veteran of Vietnam. ''I don't think we came over here to fight for low oil prices. The atrocities we came to stop are still going on in Kuwait and we're just sitting here.''
''I think all the big people involved in this should come out to the desert, here in the sun,'' Sergeant Brooks added. ''I think they'd make a decision real fast.''
''I want to be able to go to church,'' said Pvt. Woodrow Campbell, 19. ''It matters to me.''
A sergeant said a tent was being raised to serve as a chapel. Several men said the fact that their unit has a chaplain is very important to them.
Several soldiers complained that they were taking a pay cut because they were sent to fight in Saudi Arabia. They said they lost a supplemental $180 per month for off-base living expenses in the United States, and were given instead an extra $110 hazardous duty pay -adding up to a loss of $70 a month for risking their lives in the desert.
''We work for less pay than most American civilians,'' one private said, ''and we have a job that starts at 4 in the morning and doesn't end most nights until 9 P.M.

House Approves Pact Relaxing Czech Trade

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 17

 BODY:
The House tonight unanimously approved a trade agreement between the United States and Czechoslovakia that would reduce tariffs and increase business ties and tourism between the two countries.
The accord, which was signed by the two Governments in April, still has to be cleared by the Senate. Action expected before Congress adjourns.
Newly democratic Czechoslovakia would get the lowest possible tariffs for its exports to the United States, making products like Czech glassware and beer more competitive in the American market. Trade between the United States and Czechoslovakia now runs about $150 million a year.
In return for getting favorable tariff treatment, Prague has agreed to treat Americans the same way as Czechoslovaks in establishing bank accounts and paying for goods within the country. Also, hard-currency earnings of American companies in Czechoslovakia can be immediately taken out of the country.

HEADLINE: Navajo Leader Is Guilty In a Tribal Bribery Trial

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WINDOW ROCK, Ariz., Oct. 17

 BODY:
Peter MacDonald Sr., the suspended leader of the Navajo Nation, the country's largest Indian tribe, was found guilty today in Navajo tribal court on 41 of 42 counts of accepting bribes, violating the tribe's ethics laws and conspiracy.
His son, Peter (Rocky) MacDonald Jr., was found guilty of all of the 23 similar charges he faced.
Leaving the tribal courthouse here smiling and holding hands with his wife, Wanda, Mr. MacDonald told reporters the verdict ''was no surprise'' because the special prosecutor was ''snow jobbing'' the jury. He also said he still considered himself chairman of the tribe and asked for votes in the tribe's Nov. 6 election. 
 
No Decision on Appeal
His lawyer, Val R. Jolley of Farmington, N. M., said that Mr. MacDonald would probably appeal his conviction to the Navajo Supreme Court but that he would not represent him.
The defense called no witnesses in the two-week trial and Mr. MacDonald did not take the stand.
Although Navajo ethics laws require Mr. MacDonald to step down as chairman, Mr. Jolley said he should remain leader of the tribe until the Navajo Tribal Council impeaches him.
''Since nobody has been convicted under this statute before nobody really knows the procedures,'' Mr. Jolley said. Sentencing is scheduled for Monday, and Mr. Jolley said his client faced up to 10 years in tribal jail and thousands of dollars in fines.
 
Two Trials Pending
Mr. MacDonald faces two other criminal trials in the Navajo court, and Robert Rothstein, a special prosecutor brought in by the tribe, said 70 potential corruption cases involving former Navajo officials were pending. Mr. Rothstein is a member of the Santa Fe law firm of Rothstein, Bennett, Daly, Donatelli & Hughes.
Special prosecutors accused the MacDonalds of acting as a team to solicit $400,000 in what were portrayed as consulting fees and loans from businessmen seeking preferable treatment or lucrative contracts worth millions of dollars from the tribe.
In several instances, prosecutors said, the younger Mr. MacDonald was hired as a consultant who was supposedly familiar with tribal procedures. Several witnesses testified that all that was known about him was his relationship to his father, and that many times he performed no work.
''People paid for influence and that's what Rocky MacDonald got them,'' said Mark Donatelli, another special prosecutor.
The jury found that the MacDonalds conspired to hide their illegal transactions by fabricating documents to conceal illegal transactions.
Mr. Jolley argued that the prosecution's evidence was largely circumstantial and inconclusive. Acknowledging the MacDonalds took money, he said they were loans or gifts based on social relationships or legitimate consulting fees.
Mr. Donatelli said today's verdict should send a message that tribal governments expect honest leaders.
 
Years of Prosperity
Mr. MacDonald, who was the Navajo chairman for 13 years over two periods between 1970 and the time of his suspension, led the Navajos during an era in which the tribe experienced much of its economic growth.
By next year the tribe expects to earn $73 million from its reserves of oil, gas, coal mining, investments, timber and land rentals. Another $20 million will come in from its own business taxes. Its annual general budget averages $88 million, tribal officials say. Federal appropriations bring in another $100 million annually.
Long seen as brash, enigmatic yet charismatic figure on the 26,100-square-mile reservation, Mr. MacDonald remains a man of contrasts simultaneously revered and reviled by Navajos and non-Indians.
Throughout the trial, he called the proceedings against him a ''sham'' and ''political witchhunt.''
On Tuesday, Mr. MacDonald is scheduled to stand trial in tribal court on charges of defrauding the tribe on its purchase of a ranch for $33.4 million.
On leaving the court today, he had no comment on last week's Federal indictment of a former associate, Byron Brown, in connection with the 1987 purchase of the ranch.

HEADLINE: Federal Budget Puts Wild Card Into Ohio Race

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CLEVELAND, Oct. 14

 BODY:
With a base of support in this largely ethnic, racially diverse and heavily unionized city, George Voinovich, a Republican who is a popular former Mayor, seemed to start the campaign for governor of Ohio already holding the Democratic trump card.
So it was hardly surprising that polls this month showed Mr. Voinovich with a lead of 10 percentage points or more over the Democratic nominee, Anthony J. Celebrezze Jr., the State Attorney General.
But in the budget dispute in Washington, Mr. Voinovich may have been dealt a troublesome wild card, as many reports of the rancorous battle over taxes have cast the Republicans as protectors of the rich.
''You bet it's going to affect my vote,'' said Iva Schuster, as she stacked supplies at a K mart store in the working-class suburb of Berea. ''They're trying to put the screws to blue-collar people like us.'' 
 
Working Class vs. Elite
In a dash, Democrats here have hit the airwaves with commercials that portray Mr. Voinovich as part of a Republican Party establishment that caters to the elite.
Mr. Celebrezze, who has also criticized his opponent for recently holding a $25,000-a-ticket fund-raising event with President Bush, contends that his polls now show the race even.
Until now, the contest to succeed Gov. Richard F. Celeste, a Democrat who is required by state law to step down after serving two consecutive terms, has seen little in the way of fireworks or political drama.
''Voinovich has been running very strongly in traditionally Democratic country,'' said Herbert Asher, a political science professor at Ohio State University. ''Now Celebrezze has finally latched on to something that could narrow the gap: populism. He's running against Washington, putting himself forward as the man who will fight for the working class.''
But Mr. Voinovich stands to benefit from an economic upswing in Cleveland, a city that was flat on its back in 1979, when he took over as Mayor.
The symbol of Cleveland's renaissance is rising on the banks of the Cuyahoga River, where a gleaming new 52-story building, Tower City Center, boasts expensive stores, hotels and movie theaters. Along with other new commercial projects, the center is seen as a symbol of civic pride, a jewel amid the rust that characterized the long, hard times for this old factory city.
 
Delay in Endorsement
''I'm a registered Democrat, but I'm voting for Voinovich,'' said Leon Burleigh, a security guard inside the center, who said he owed his job to the aggressive policies of the former Mayor. ''And he's been fair to everyone. He's given blacks a fair shake.''
Cleveland's Mayor, Michael White, a Democrat, has endorsed Mr. Celebrezze. But the Mayor, who is black, did not do so until well into the campaign, and political observers here say the delay demonstrated Mr. Voinovich's popularity among voters here, black and white. Mr. Voinovich stepped down as Mayor in December after 10 years in office.
Throughout Ohio, especially in urban centers that experienced hard times in the 1970's, many voters cite the Cleveland turnaround as reason enough to support the Republican. ''If he can do for the rest of Ohio what he did for Cleveland,'' said Doug Welker, who works for the General Motors Company in Youngstown, ''then I'm all for Voinovich.''
But many Ohioans expressed resentment toward Republicans on the tax issue.
Vice President Dan Quayle campaigned Saturday with Mr. Voinovich in rural southeastern Ohio, the impoverished, hilly country that shares many of the problems of Appalachia.
Curtis Ramey, a 49-year-old firefighter in Rio Grande, took his 6-year-old grandson to the curbside in the little town to catch a glimpse of the Vice President, who waved from the back seat of a black limousine that moved past the clapboard houses here.
 
Paying Fair Share
''I wanted the boy to see the Vice President, but I'm voting Democrat,'' Mr. Ramey said curtly, folding his arms against his chest. ''The rich people ought to start paying their fair share. The Republicans don't seem to understand that.''
The two candidates are generally viewed here as honest and intelligent politicians, if not dynamic campaigners. Their agendas do not seem drastically at odds, although they differ on the abortion issue.
Mr. Celebrezze, reversing a longtime stand, has declared his support for a woman's right to abortion; Mr. Voinovich, who has characterized his opponent as ''a flip-flopper'' on the issue, opposes abortion except in cases of rape, incest or where necessary to protect the health of the woman.
''The abortion issue hasn't had the kind of salience that it has in other states,'' said Mr. Asher, the political science professor. ''Voinovich has done very little to scare the pro-choice people. He's said he wouldn't try to change the status quo.''
At the rally in Rio Grande with Mr. Quayle, Mr. Voinovich stressed patriotism and prosperity. The Republican, a tall, slender man with an angular face, punched his index finger in the air and vowed that rural Ohio ''will not be forgotten.''
''There will be jobs, more jobs, better jobs,'' he said.
 
'Rights of Victims'
In his endorsement, Mr. Quayle praised Mr. Voinovich as someone who would ''put the rights of victims ahead of the rights of criminals.'' And he accused Congressional Democrats of stalling on the budget.
''They fight us on everything,'' Mr. Quayle said with exasperation.
At a country fair in nearby Gallipolis, where Mr. Voinovich stopped briefly with the Vice President, a young dental hygienist sat on a bale of hay and promised her vote.
''The Republicans believe people should have to work for a living,'' said the woman, Raegene Wood, as she listened to a country music band strum a Merle Haggard standard. ''The Democrats are more for giving handouts.''
On the stump, Mr. Celebrezze, the son of a former Mayor of Cleveland, has the deliberate manner of an economics professor, explaining the certitude of his theories.
''Our message is very simple,'' he told a group of black supporters in Columbus on Saturday. ''We will work on behalf of working people and forgotten people.''
''The Republicans have no concept of what working people earn,'' he added, rolling his eyes in disgust over the $25,000-a-ticket Republican event that Mr. Bush attended here earlier in the campaign. ''I intend to work for the people who make $25,000 in a whole year.''

ANALYSIS
 
While the candidates differ on the issue of abortion, the race appears to pivot on the coice between Mr. Voinovich's pro-business stance, which invigorated Cleveland during his years as Mayor, and Mr. Celebrezze's position that workers and others ofmodest means are not getting a fair shake from government, especially on taxes.

Cuomo Tactics: Avoiding Curse Of Incumbency

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York is defying the odds against incumbents this year because: (a) - Republicans miscalculated by presuming that he was invulnerable. (b) - Even after serving for 15 years in state government, he manages to be regarded as a political outsider. (c) - The anti-incumbent tide may be greatly exaggerated. (d) - All of the above. The correct answer is (d). With Election Day less than three weeks away, almost nobody realistically doubts that Mr. Cuomo will win a third term - in sharp contrast to three other Democratic governors from the Northeast who chose not to run again and at least two Republicans who are considered vulnerable. About all that is left to ponder is whether Mr. Cuomo's victory margin will hit a record high and whether voter turnout will plummet to a record low, and why.
The G.O.P.'s Misjudgment: Mr. Cuomo had raised $7 million by last spring, and potential challengers were duly intimidated. But they either failed to detect, or felt unequipped to capitalize on, two trends detected in some public-opinion polls: while the Governor was still personally popular, fewer people were impressed with his performance; moreover, many New Yorkers said they were dissatisfied with the direction in which they thought the state was going. 
A well-financed, articulate challenger who offered a convincing rationale for his candidacy could have given Mr. Cuomo a run for his money. None of those qualities seemed to apply to Pierre A. Rinfret, the Republicans' nominee of last resort.
That no more credible candidate could be enlisted also reflects the decline of political parties, which no longer can absorb campaign debts or bruised egos. Republicans have been deprived of an opportunity to deflate the Presidential trial balloons that are sent up periodically on Mr. Cuomo's behalf. He has been denied the chance to hone his skills for a more challenging national campaign.
The Odd Man In: Mr. Cuomo served in Albany as secretary of state and then lieutenant governor before being elected governor in 1982, but he has largely avoided the curse of incumbency. ''Mario never had the personality of an incumbent,'' said David Garth, the media strategist. ''He always has someone to be in moral conflict with - the Mayor, the Legislature, the President. As a result, it always looks like he's an outsider.''
He has also often been on the cutting edge of issues, saying that New York's problems are not unique and that many stem from Federal abdications. ''Mario has always sounded the anti-Washington, anti-conventional-wisdom alarm,'' said Robert D. Squier, a political consultant to Dr. John K. Silber, the Boston University president, whose victory in last month's Democratic primary for governor of Massachusetts was viewed as evidence that voters crave a fresh approach.
William Mulrow, an official of Mr. Cuomo's campaign, analyzed Dr. Silber's platform and said that although his politically unconventional views sound fresh, ''most of what he proposes has already been tried or accomplished in the past eight years in New York State.''
The Mixed Blessing of Incumbency: Many voters are incensed about being taxed more for benefits that they never seem to reap. But newness alone in a challenger is not enough. Among statewide incumbents, only Comptroller Edward V. Regan, the lone Republican, appears to be vulnerable. In a period of economic uncertainty, Mr. Rinfret has helped define his own race as one between an erratic newcomer and an experienced political tactician.
''This is a time of uncertainty, confusion, even occasional moments of chaos,'' Mr. Cuomo said. ''People want strength.'' Mentioning Presiden Bush and Mayor David N. Dinkins in the same breath, he said, ''There is a sense in the people that government is not being clear, decisive and giving effective leadership'' - weaknesses the media seizes upon.
''Dinkins's 'ambivalence' - they love to charge you with ambivalence,'' Mr. Cuomo said. ''Bush? Look what they're doing to Bush - flip-flop. This is a very important characteristic - not being able to make the decision. That's what the people see and that is what the media is playing up. And I understand it.''
Rather than capping the number of terms an official can serve, Mr. Cuomo would reduce the edge of officeholders by publicly financing campaigns. But the two-term Governor dismisses the notion that incumbency is now a fatal liability. ''We see two dots, we draw one line and we think we have a rhombus,'' said Mr. Cuomo, whose oblique angles comprise a candidacy that may not always seem to be politically symmetrical but is in surprisingly good shape.

HEADLINE: Environmental Bond Passage in Doubt

BYLINE: By ALLAN R. GOLD

 BODY:
With less than three weeks to go until Election Day, strong opposition by upstate New York residents to the $2 billion environmental bond issue has put government and private supporters on the defensive and passage of the measure in doubt.
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who hoped to get easy political mileage from the 21st Century Environmental Quality Bond Act, instead finds himself the target of criticism from upstate residents, particularly those in the Adirondacks, who oppose using bond proceeds to buy private land there.
''Many of the people north of the Tappan Zee will not support the bond issue,'' Lieut. Gov. Stan Lundine said on Tuesday at a gathering of supporters of the bond act.
Last spring, in the afterglow of Earth Day, environmental groups were confident the bond issue would pass easily. All nine previous environmental issues have been approved by voters. 
But a combination of the state's growing financial problems, upstate hostility to land purchases and a general lack of knowledge about the bond act have given supporters cause for concern, they say.
People around Adirondack Park are already angry about a state commission's report last spring recommending large land purchases and stricter regulation. Such acquisitions will depress economic activity in the region, opponents say.
''We feel the money could be better used in New York City for fire, police and disadvantaged kids, rather than buying land and letting it sit here,'' said Marty Mischenko, a spokesman for the Adirondack Solidarity Alliance in Lewis.
Prominent critics include Comptroller Edward V. Regan, who is running for re-election against Carol Bellamy, a supporter of the bond act; Pierre A. Rinfret, the Republican candidate for governor, and the New York Farm Bureau, the state's largest farm advocacy organization. All of these assert the bond issue is fiscally irresponsible.
''The state is broke,'' Mr. Rinfret said, ''and can't afford the acquisition of more land at this time.''
The bond act would authorize borrowing $1.975 billion for land purchases, recycling programs, closing landfills and historic preservation.
''We don't have a way to pay for these projects if it fails,'' said Anne Crowley, a spokeswoman for Mr. Cuomo. ''That's precisely why the Governor proposed the bond act.''
''It may be in some trouble because of the bad financial news over the last month or two,'' said Larry Shapiro, a representative with the New York Public Interest Research Group, a nonprofit environmental lobbying and research organization.
The Heritage 2000 Alliance, an umbrella organization of supporters of the bond act, has begun a public relations campaign. Mr. Cuomo, who has made the bond act a top priority, will keep pressing for it, a spokesman said.
''He's been all over the state explaining what the bond act would do, why it is necessary and why it is affordable and why it can't wait,'' said the spokesman, Thomas Conroy. Supporters say the bond act would cost each state resident $7 a year for the life of the bonds.
In a recent survey of registered voters by the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion in Poughkeepsie, 71.5 percent of the respondents said they had not heard of the bond act.
At $800 million, land acquisition would account for the largest chunk of the proceeds. Money for land purchases from the last two bond acts has been committed or will soon be obligated. The remaining $1.175 billion would be divided into these categories:
* Solid-waste programs like recycling, landfill closure and medical-waste disposal would get $525 million.
* A wide range of environmental restoration and preservation projects, $201 million.
* Acquisition and improvement of municipal parks and historic preservation, $175 million.
* Financing of a local sewage-treatment plant loan fund, $174 million.
* Assistance in the development of the West Side waterfront esplanade along the Hudson River, $100 million.
Including the esplanade money, New York City can expect to receive $500 million to $700 million of the bond issue proceeds, said Sandford Evans, a spokesman for the Department of Environmental Protection. City officials estimate that New York would receive $100 million to buy land in the Catskill watershed area to protect drinking water quality and $100 million for recycling and closing landfills.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Links Teacher Raise To Albany

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins said yesterday that if the State Legislature did not approve changes in pension earnings assumptions to finance almost half of a 5.5 percent raise for teachers, New York City would not be liable for making up the difference.
In one sense, Mr. Dinkins's comments -made in response to questions about the raise on a day when he came under more pressure from fiscal monitors critical of the contract - simply restated his contention that only 1.5 percent of the raise would be borne directly by the city budget.
''If we don't get the pension fund money, we have no commitment to fill that hole,'' Mr. Dinkins said. But in other ways, Mr. Dinkins stepped out on a political tightrope. 
On the one hand, he seemed to be sending a signal to the financial community. Senior mayoral aides acknowledged that by so publicly attempting to shift more of the burden for the contract to the Legislature, he could be paving the way for a renegotiation of the entire contract, if fiscal conditions grew so bad that the Legislature would not approve the change.
 
Union Takes Exception
On the other hand, he risked alienating the teachers union, his strong political ally, which says a deal is a deal. And there is no reason to suspect that the Mayor actually hopes that the deal will fail under present conditions.
Susan Amlung, a spokeswoman for the United Federation of Teachers, said yesterday that the union did not share the Mayor's view on the raise. ''There was no mention of any contingencies when the memorandum of understanding was signed,'' she said. ''It's our position we have a legal, binding contract, assuming ratification by the members and approval by the Board of Education.''
Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez said in an interview that he was sure the school board would devise ''some kind of safeguards'' to assure that the Legislature's approval would be necessary before the raise could take effect.
Indeed, city officials said the memorandum of agreement between the city and union specified that a provision in the existing contract, based on the state civil service law, would continue. That provision says that any part of the contract that requires legislative approval to provide financing shall not become effective until the relevant body has acted.
It appears doubtful that the Mayor could simply drop the matter into the Legislature's lap, since it would not be likely to buck the powerful teachers union even if the Mayor asked it to, and Mr. Dinkins's aides said he had not.
In fact, legislative aides in Albany said the Mayor had told the leaders there that he could not possibly renege on the teachers contract, since he would never again have credibility with labor.
The city is proposing to raise, from 8.25 percent to 9 percent, the figure that represents how much it thinks the pension fund's investments will earn each year. A higher earning estimate means that the city would need to contribute less to the fund, and the extra money would be used to generate a 2.5 percent raise for the teachers. The rest of the 5.5 percent increase would come from state aid and previously budgeted city funds. Other unions still negotiating contracts have said they will seek similar raises using the same approach.
James A. Yates, counsel to Assembly Speaker Mel Miller, a Brooklyn Democrat, said, ''I assume that if the Mayor asks for us to approve'' the change ''and it's actuarially sound, then the Assembly would approve it.'' Prudent Assumptions? Carl A. Carlucci, secretary to the Assembly's Ways and Means Committee, said, referring to City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman, ''If every actuary in the world said this is a bad idea, or if Liz Holtzman said this is not prudent,'' then the Assembly might have to look skeptically at it.
Some pension experts have suggested such an increase might not be prudent, given a declining economy, and might commit the city to bailing the funds out in the future.
Ms. Amlung of the teachers union said the city may want to delay the payment of the raise until Albany approves the change in pension assumptions. But she said the union believed the settlement could not be abrogated, and was studying what actions it could take to enforce it.
But yesterday, in the latest criticism of the idea, the board of the Municipal Assistance Corporation unanimously urged that savings from such pension changes be used to close a projected gap in the city's budget for the coming fiscal year of at least $1.4 billion, and to avoid the large-scale layoffs of city workers that Mr. Dinkins has warned might be necessary.
 
'Social Balance' Called For
In a letter to the State Financial Control Board, which includes Mr. Dinkins, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and the City and State Comptrollers, and to the Speaker of the City Council, which would also have to approve use of the pension money, the chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, Felix G. Rohatyn, said, ''Credible fiscal balance is necessary for full and free access to the credit markets.''
He added, repeating a theme he has sounded often in recent weeks: ''Social balance dictates the fewest number of layoffs possible. Both objectives will be served by dedicating whatever pension savings are deemed prudent to general budget purposes.''
Mr. Rohatyn said yesterday that he planned to step down by the end of the year. But Mr. Rohatyn's views still hold considerable sway in the financial markets, and he is only one of a number of critics who have raised concern about the teachers pay agreement. City Council President Andrew J. Stein has said that the pension changes should not be approved, and aides to Ms. Holtzman, the City Comptroller, predicted yesterday that scrutiny of the issue would grow as both state and city faced larger budget gaps.
Mr. Dinkins met yesterday with officials of Moody's Investors Service and the Standard and Poor's Corporation, in an effort to assure them that he will keep the city's budget balanced. Last week, citing concerns about the teachers contract and other matters, Standard and Poors, a major credit rating agency, warned that the city's bond rating might fall.
''I explained to them that I had an understanding, a grasp of the situation in which we find ourselves,'' the Mayor said.

HEADLINE: In Connecticut, A Big Silence On Prison Crisis

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SOMERS, Conn.

 BODY:
Detailed proposals about crime and punishment have been few and far between in Connecticut's race for governor. Many people inside the state's overwhelmed criminal-justice system say the relative silence has raised the level of campaign honesty.
With a crushing budget deficit looming for the state, a huge prison expansion only now approaching midway, and a toughened sentencing system taking effect this month after years of debate and public outcry, experts say that promises of sweeping reform in how Connecticut deals with crime could probably not be kept.
For the short-term, they say, the state's next governor will be just one more prisoner of the apparatus forged in the 1980's. 
 
Operating Budget Has Tripled
Prior financial commitments alone will be considerable. The 10-year prison expansion that began in 1985, at nearly $1 billion for 8,200 new prison beds, is one of the most expensive in the nation. Yet the prison system is still expected to fall far short of the growing criminal population.
The new construction has in turn forced a tripling of the prison operating budget since 1985, to $231 million this year, and state budget officials say that further large spending increases for new guards and administrators extend as far as the eye can see. The Department of Correction is seeking a 49 percent one-year spending increase, to $345.6 million, for the year that begins next July 1.
Here at the Somers Correctional Institution, the state's largest prison, the concerns are more gut-level. Somers, which was built to house 900 inmates in 1963 now holds more than 1,400 and officials plan to squeeze in another 200. The prison, set on 1,400 acres that were once part of a Shaker farm, is one of four state prisons on the site, with a combined population of about 3,500 - more than a third of the state's prison population of 9,876. Two more prisons are to be completed by 1993. There are shortages of both space and staff. Younger guards with less experience, hired in the expansion, are supervising inmates who are more violent and less controllable than ever. Double-bunking in many cell blocks has pushed tensions higher still. A shortage of guards has made mandatory 16-hour tours-of-duty common. Then there is what they call ''creaming down.'' The phrase, attributed to the state's Commissioner of Correction, Larry Meachum, is a direct result of the way Connecticut has expanded its prisons, with almost all of the growth in lower-security, fast-track construction of dormitory-style prisons rather than higher security - and far more expensive - individual-cell lockup prisons.
With only one maximum-security prison in the state, Somers, here on the Massachusetts border, officials admit that many inmates who should stay in maximum security are shipped out. Like skimming cream on milk, the idea is to take out the best of the worst criminals and disperse them to other operations.
Guards say, however, that creaming down leaves Somers with an ever-harder core of violent inmates, and the new dormitory prisons with growing numbers of only slightly less dangerous inmates who cannot be isolated in cells when things get out of hand. The dormitory prisons don't have cells.
 
'A Lot More Dangerous'
''It means that cheap minimum-security structures are housing maximum-security inmates,'' said Michael Ferrucci Jr., the chief negotiator for the union that represents state prison guards.
''It's a lot more dangerous job than it used to be,'' said Officer William Stark, who has worked at Somers for eight years. ''All you want to do is do your shift and get out alive or unhurt.''
Law-enforcement and prison authorities directly blame creaming down - along with simple overcrowding - for a riot in June that caused more than $2.7 million in damage at a four-year-old minimum-security prison just down the road from here in Enfield. Some officials warn that worse could come on the next governor's watch if the high-security prisons, to be built in the second half of the plan, are not built.
''If it were a perfect world, we would have one cell per inmate,'' said William H. Carbone, chairman of the state's Prison and Jail Overcrowding Commission, which oversees prison construction in the state. ''But the rate of increase in the population did not permit us to do that. What was feasible was dorms.''
 
Pay Would Be Frozen
So far, none of the three major candidates for governor has proposed any sweeping changes in either the construction plans or operation of the system, though one, Representative John G. Rowland, Republican of Waterbury, has said he would try to make it easier for the state to impose the death penalty and would seek salary concessions from all state employees, including prison guards, whose pay would be frozen.
Mr. Rowland has also said he would not rule out trying to squeeze more inmates into the current space, perhaps up to 130 percent of capacity. Current state law imposes a ceiling at 110 percent of capacity.
Both the Democrat, Representative Bruce A. Morrison, of Hamden, and the former Senator, Lowell P. Weicker Jr., running on his own Connecticut Party, have said that building more prisons is fruitless, though neither has recommended turning back on commitments already made.
Both men have emphasized alternatives to incarceration, especially community service and drug rehabilitation. Mr. Morrison says in addition that he would favor life without parole or ''death in prison,'' as he calls it, for particularly heinous crimes.
 
Opposition From Lawmakers
In any event, efforts to change the sentencing system would probably encounter opposition from lawmakers and administrators who worked, in some cases for years, on the overhaul completed just last spring.
The plan, enacted under public pressure to keep inmates in jail longer, eliminated a supervised home-release program that had allowed many convicted criminals - especially for nonviolent crimes like selling drugs - to be released after serving only 10 percent of their sentences.
In its place, the new law requires anyone sentenced to prison to serve at least 50 percent of their sentence before being eligible for release. Longer prison time will in turn, however, require more prisons and Mr. Carbone's commission is expecting to have waiting on the next governor's desk in January a request for at least 3,000 to 4,000 more prison beds, or the equivalent of about 10 new units.
''Those are optimistic numbers that 4,000 beds are going to be enough,'' said State Representative Richard D. Tulisano, Democrat of Rocky Hill, who is co-chairman of the General Assembly's Judiciary Committee, and the main author of the new law. ''We have yet to accept that we can't build our way out of this.''

HEADLINE: Nobel Winner Salves a Bruised Baruch

BYLINE: By SAMUEL WEISS

 BODY:
The award of a Nobel Prize to a faculty member would bring pride and joy to any campus but for Baruch College, the award of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science on Tuesday to Dr. Harry M. Markowitz had a special poignancy.
''The whole campus is just very joyous,'' Virgil Bird, chairman of the college's Faculty Senate, said yesterday.
These have been rough times for the Manhattan school, the largest school of business in the nation and the school that trained as many as one-third of the accountants in the city. Last March, a major accrediting agency, the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools, deferred Baruch's normal 10-year reaccreditation on the ground that it had not done enough to hire minority faculty members and that it had done a poor job in retaining minority students. 
Educators at the time said the action was the first time that a major college had been threatened with a loss of accreditation on such grounds. Baruch, a college of 16,100 students, in the Gramercy Park section, is the second-largest branch of the City University of New York. Many faculty members, Mr. Bird said, were ''very demoralized by the controversy.''
 
College's President Resigns
Soon after the accrediting body's action, Dr. Joel Segall, the president of Baruch for 13 years, resigned, and students began questioning the value of their degree credits.
Those fears were largely allayed at the end of June when the Middle States fully reaccredited Baruch after accepting a comprehensive plan by the college for hiring more minority faculty members and providing more support for minority students. Still, many faculty members, administrators and students say the announcement of Dr. Markowitz's prize - for developing a theory for diversifying assets in investment portfolios - was a needed boost to the college's morale and reputation.
''I think the recognition of Dr. Markowitz's award provided a very good example of the hidden treasures on this campus,'' said Dr. Joyce F. Brown, the City University's vice chancellor of urban affairs who became acting president of Baruch on Sept. 1.
Toni Colavito, editor in chief of the student newspaper The Ticker, said while many students believed the criticisms of the college were justified, they were ''happy to get some good publicity for a change.''
 
Proof of 'a Real University'
Dr. Frederick S. Lane, a professor of public administration, said too many New Yorkers tended to take the City University for granted.
''Many people think the ideal university is always some place else,'' said Dr. Lane, who served as executive director of the Governor's Task Force for Higher Education in the mid-1970's. ''I think Dr. Markowitz's Nobel Prize shows they're wrong - that New Yorkers have a real university right in front of them.''
But Dr. Donald H. Smith, chairman of the college's education department, said that he did not want people to draw the wrong conclusions.
''I think it's wonderful for the college that Dr. Markowitz received the Nobel Prize but I don't think it is indicative of anything concerning the Middle States findings,'' he said. ''Middle States questioned the lack of diversity and inclusion on this campus. No one ever complained that the people presently employed were not people of quality.''
Faculty members in Baruch's School of Business and Public Adminstration are pursuing a grievance against the Middle States association before the Council of Post-Secondary Accreditation, a Washington group that oversees the nation's major accrediting organizations. The grievance claims the deferral of the college's reaccreditation was unjustified.
The college, in its response to the accrediting association, promised that Baruch would recruit more minority candidates for administrative and teaching positions, would review the content and organization of programs to retain students and would re-evaluate its curriculum to insure that it prepares students for a ''multicultural college and work environment.''

HEADLINE: 'Productivity Gain' in Pact With Teachers Is Optional

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
A concession won by the New York City Board of Education in its contract with the teachers union - a speedier system for disciplining teachers - is not compulsory, officials have acknowledged. It is an option that teachers can choose.
The disclosure may raise further questions about the wisdom of the 5.5 percent wage increase that was granted to the teachers as part of the contract. Felix G. Rohatyn, the chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, and others have challenged the prudence of such an increase at a time of budget cuts. 
Replying to these critics, Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez took pains yesterday to defend the pay increase, telling the Board of Education in a four-page statement that he sought ''the largest increase the city could afford'' so he could retain the ''best and brightest'' teachers. He singled out the optional disciplinary process for tenured teachers as one of the productivity gains he had won. #3-Member Panels Now Used The new process is part of a contract agreement that must still be approved by the union membership and the board. And since it is optional, teachers can still pick the current disciplinary procedure, which is more time-consuming.
At present, charges of incompetence, insubordination, drug use or other misconduct are heard by three panelists, one chosen by the board, one by the union and an impartial chairman chosen by both sides. The panel's ruling is not binding and can be appealed to the State Commissioner of Education.
The new process would effectively reduce the panel to a single arbitrator whose decision and penalties, announced within two weeks of the close of hearings, would be binding. Administrative appeals would be barred, though a teacher could resort to the civil courts.
Both officials of the board and the United Federation of Teachers said when the agreement was announced that the new process would shave months off the time needed to choose panelists and to schedule hearings. It would also save thousands of dollars in teachers' salaries, which are paid until a ruling is made.
 
'May Have Been My Fault'
The fact that teachers can reject the binding arbitration procedure and elect to use the three-member panels was not publicized by James S. Vlasto, press secretary to Mr. Fernandez, when the press secretary explained the contract accord on Oct. 1. The union's press statement also did not say the new procedure was voluntary, calling it an ''experimental disciplinary and termination process.''
Mr. Vlasto said the failure to clarify the provision ''may have been my fault.''
''There was a little confusion about the final wording of the memorandum,'' he said, referring to the contract. He added, however, that there was no effort to conceal the voluntary nature of the deal, because ''we were satisfied with it.''
Susan Amlung, a spokeswoman for the union, said she had told reporters at a City Hall news conference on the accord that the new procedure was voluntary.
 
Speed Offers Benefits
Both Mr. Vlasto and Ms. Amlung contended that most teachers would prefer binding arbitration.
It will be chosen, Ms. Amlung said, by those who ''want to have their name cleared'' or those ''who recognize the validity of the charges'' and want to ''get it over with quickly.''
Rhonda Weingarten, counsel to the union's president, also noted that the new disciplinary procedure had to be optional, since any changes in the current process would require state legislation.
According to Lawrence E. Becker, head of the board's Office of Legal Services, the board disposed of 53 cases of professional misconduct from September 1989 until July 1990, with 40 resulting in an employee's leaving the system. Three-quarters of the cases involved tenured teachers, he said. #5.5 Percent Raise Defended In his statement yesterday, Mr. Fernandez argued that only 1.5 percent of the 5.5 percent pay increase would come from city funds. A second 1.5 percent portion, he said, is derived from state aid allocated for inflationary rises, and a 2.5 percent portion ''comes from the teachers own pension fund.''
Actually, the pension savings would stem from a more optimistic assumption about how much interest the pension fund's investments would earn. The city could then reduce its contributions to the fund and use the savings for increased teacher salaries.
Mr. Fernandez argued that the size of other union raises should not be linked to that given to the teachers. ''In contrast to other city agencies,'' he said, ''our schools are constantly losing staff to nearby school districts, which consistently pay more than we do.''

HEADLINE: Talks by I.B.M. and Motorola On Advanced Chip Collapse

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
Negotiations between Motorola Inc. and the I.B.M. Corporation to license the computer maker's most advanced memory-chip technology have collapsed, dashing some people's hopes of an American alliance that would strengthen the nation's semiconductor industry.
The talks, which began earlier this year, focused on offering I.B.M.'s four-million-bit computer memory design to Motorola. The chips, which store the equivalent of more than 300 pages of typed text, are the highest capacity now in production. They are used in the most advanced computers, from mainframes to laptops. 
The collapse of the negotiations was disclosed recently by people familiar with them in the Government and in the industry. An I.B.M. spokesman said that since the company had never acknowledged the discussions, it would not comment on the report that they had ended. Motorola also refused to comment.
High-capacity memory chips, known as dynamic random access memories, or D-RAM's, have grown increasingly important in all modern electronic products. Being able to build the most advanced memory chips is seen as vital to competing in the semiconductor business.
Currently, I.B.M. is the only American manufacturer of the four-million-bit chip. Motorola, which has an agreement to produce one-million-bit chips under license from the Toshiba Corporation of Japan, plans to use Toshiba's technology to produce four-million-bit chips in the future.
According to I.B.M. executives and industry analysts, the computer maker has been trying to create a second source of semiconductor supply separate from Japanese manufacturers and has also been seeking to fashion a broader industrywide alliance to strengthen America's high-technology manufacturing base.
The Motorola-I.B.M. relationship has also been cited by Charles H. Ferguson, a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as a crucial element of a proposed American-European strategy for withstanding Japanese industrial competition.
Writing in the July issue of the Harvard Business Review, Mr. Ferguson advocates the formation of American ''keiretsu,'' or cooperating associations of private corporations whose technologies complement each other. The Japanese have made large inroads in world high-technology markets by using the keiretsu to allocate investments in strategic industries.
''It surprises me,'' Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., an economist and former United States trade official, said recently. ''It seemed like a logical thing. It was in line with thinking about cooperative deals to give the United States companies the same kind of heft and bulk of the Japanese.''
 
Dominance Expected to Wane
But other industry executives have contended that Japanese control of semiconductor memory technology will begin to wane because of the huge capital costs in developing advanced semiconductor plants.
''My view is that Japanese domination is anomalistic,'' said Andrew S. Rappaport, the president of the Technology Research Group, a semiconductor consulting group in Boston. He argues that in future generations of computer memories, competitors from regions around the globe will enter the market, thereby lessening Japanese control of the industry.
The International Business Machines Corporation, based in Armonk, N.Y., has already licensed its semiconductor technology to Micron Technologies Inc., a computer memory maker in Boise, Idaho, and was prepared to make a similar agreement with United States Memories, a consortium seeking to create an independent American maker of memory chips.
One other American company, the Dallas-based Texas Instruments Inc., is now making D-RAM's, with help from Hitachi Ltd. of Tokyo.
 
Other Talks Fall Through
Earlier this year I.B.M. also discussed licensing its memory technology to Cypress Semiconductor Inc., a Silicon Valley chip maker, but Cypress declined to come to an agreement, saying I.B.M. was asking too much.
Several people in the industry familiar with the I.B.M.-Motorola negotiations said similarly that the talks had broken off last month because I.B.M. was asking substantially more for access to its technology than Motorola was paying to Toshiba.
Motorola, based in Schaumburg, Ill., originally entered the negotiations because it was concerned about its dependence on Toshiba, one of the world's leading semiconductor makers, according to the Government and industry executives.
 
Looking to the Future
Nevertheless, in July, Motorola said it had signed a memorandum with Toshiba that covered a second phase of their agreement. Industry executives believe that the memo covers future technologies through 16-million-bit memory chips and beyond. A Government official familiar with the negotiations has said Toshiba ''sweetened the pot.''
Last year, Motorola agreed to participate with I.B.M. in developing X-ray technology to use in advanced chips. The technology may be widely used later in the decade.

HEADLINE: Oil Prices Tumble $2.17, To Below $37

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Oil prices tumbled yesterday as the stalemate continued in the Persian Gulf. The decline occurred despite a report that the nation's oil inventories were falling.
''With a lack of fresh news and a lack of military action, these levels just might be too high for this market,'' said Thomas Blakeslee, analyst at Pegasus Econometrics, speaking of the record prices oil has reached recently. ''It seems like the market wants to regroup at a lower level.'' 
Oil for delivery in November on the New York Mercantile Exchange tumbled $2.17, to $36.72 a barrel. Although it rose 94 cents on Tuesday before the inventory report was released, oil prices have been mostly retreating from last week's record trading high of $41.15 a barrel and its record close of $40.42.
 
Heating Oil Below $1
Unleaded gasoline also sank, with the November contract losing 4.48 cents, to 93.40 cents a gallon. Heating oil for November delivery tumbled 5.75 cents, to 98.25 cents a gallon, the first time it has dipped under $1 a gallon since Oct. 4.
Analysts said the oil market was weighed down by the belief that crude was still widely available, despite the report that the nation's oil inventories fell last week.
The American Petroleum Institute, a leading industry group, said Tuesday, after the futures market had closed, that oil inventories fell 6.2 million barrels, to 343.3 million barrels in the week ended Oct. 12. But the institute said oil stocks were still 499,000 barrels above levels a year ago.
''I don't think there's a real shortage of crude right now,'' said Mark Scullion of Gerald Inc.
The group also said inventories of heating oil last week were a steep 15.6 million barrels above a year ago, at 120.3 million barrels, as the industry scaled up production for the winter season.
Traders may be sensing that the recent jump in oil prices on the Mideast war scare was overdone, analysts said.
 
Doubling Since Aug. 2
Oil prices have nearly doubled since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait prompted supply fears. But, as one trader said, ''There's nothing doing in the Middle East except the Saudis are producing a lot of oil.''
Traders were unsure how to interpret a statement by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d urging the world to have patience as economic sanctions tighten the noose on Iraq. But they thought it suggested a deadlock in the Middle East situation.
Testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Baker rejected a compromise solution to the Persian Gulf crisis. Iraq again dismissed suggestions that it would withdraw from Kuwait.
 
Seasonal Shutdown At Hand
Analysts said prices also eased on the belief that the demand by refiners for crude oil would drop as they started to shut down some operations for seasonal maintenance.
The petroleum institute data showed the shutdown was already under way, with refineries running last week at 85.8 percent of capacity, down 1.8 percent from a week before.
Iraq reacted yesterday to oil price fluctuations, saying it welcomed a Venezuelan proposal made earlier this month to convene a United Nations conference of oil producing and consuming countries.
''The acute current fluctuations of oil prices serve speculators in the oil market at the expense of producing and consuming countries and of developing states,'' Iraq's oil minister, Issam Abdul-Rahim al-Chalabi, said.

HEADLINE: Head of Dow Jones Sets His Retirement

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES

 BODY:
Warren H. Phillips, the longtime chairman, chief executive officer and guiding spirit of Dow Jones & Company, announced yesterday that he would step down as chief executive of the publishing and information company on Jan. 1 and retire on July 1, soon after he turns 65.
Peter R. Kann, the company's president and chief operating officer and publisher of The Wall Street Journal, will become chief executive officer. It is widely assumed that Mr. Kann, who is 47 years old, will also be named chairman when Mr. Phillips retires.
Kenneth L. Burenga, the company's general manager, will replace Mr. Kann as chief operating officer. 
By choosing Mr. Kann as his successor, Mr. Phillips has insured that Dow Jones will have at its head a person who rose from the news operation of The Wall Street Journal, the company's crown jewel.
Mr. Phillips was the managing editor of The Journal for several years and Mr. Kann won a Pulitzer Prize in 1972 for his coverage of the India-Pakistan war as The Journal's Asia correspondent.
 
Striking Growth
For much of the 15 years since Mr. Phillips became the company's chief executive officer, Dow Jones experienced enormous prosperity and was a darling of Wall Street, principally because of the striking growth of advertising and circulation of The Journal during the boom years of the 1980's.
As The Journal succeeded financially, Mr. Phillips greatly expanded its size while adding to its existing reputation as one of the nation's premier news organizations. He added a third section and pushed aggressively to cover Asia and Europe with separate editions.
But in recent years, and especially in recent months, the company's performance has been damaged by declining advertising sales at The Journal and reduced profits from the company's information services group, which includes Telerate Inc., a financial data company.
Indeed, Mr. Phillips will be stepping down at a time when the wisdom of his decision to acquire Telerate for $1.6 billion is being questioned by industry analysts because of Telerate's failure to justify the investment thus far.
''The last half-decade has been much less joyous than the first 10 years,'' said John S. Reidy, an analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company in New York. He added that whether the Telerate investment proves a success will not be known ''for a couple of years.''
Last week, Mr. Phillips and Mr. Kann announced a cost-cutting plan that included a freeze on capital spending and all departmental budgets, including total salary costs, at the budgeted 1990 level. Because of negotiated salary increases with unions, the freeze likely means that vacancies will not be filled.
The plan also callled for ''holding down news space in our publications,'' a reduction in the number of special reports, postponing the creation of a magazine, cutting the use of freelancers and correspondents, eliminating almost all relocations of people, and other moves to save money.
While The Journal has been subject to economy efforts during Mr. Phillips's tenure, there has been a great reluctance to do anything that might be perceived as diminishing the quality or breadth of the paper's coverage.
 
No More Immunity
Analysts interpreted the plan as a signal that The Journal would no longer be immune to severe constraints if they were necessary, and they hailed Mr. Phillips for his willingness to make the cutbacks.
''He stepped up and made the decision he had to,'' said James D. Dougherty, an analyst at County NatWest Securities Inc.
But Mr. Dougherty and others expressed concern that the cuts The Journal had made, similar to those at many other papers, would eventually hurt.
''I suspect the average reader may not notice next year or the year after that, but eventually they have to,'' Mr. Dougherty said. A spokesman for Dow Jones said none of the executives involved in yesterday's announcement would be available for an interview.
As head of the company, Mr. Kann will be faced with the task of restoring The Journal's level of profitability and making Telerate a financial success that will justify the company's enormous investment.
In 1985, the company's business publications group, which includes The Journal and Barron's, accounted for about 75 percent of Dow Jones's operating income; in 1989, that contribution had declined to 30 percent, reflecting both the difficult times for advertising and the absence of big cuts in overhead.
The information services group provided 64 percent of Dow Jones's operating income 1989, which showed an overall decline of 4.6 percent, to $335 million, on revenues of $1.7 billion.
 
Premium Stock Price
Throughout the 1980's, as Dow Jones revenues more than trippled and net income increased more than five fold, the company's stock sold at a premium of up to 25 times annual earnings per share, compared with the average for the Standard & Poor's 500 companies of 14 times earnings per share.
Though the stock closed unchanged yesterday at $19, about 15 times its annual earnings per share, even that multiple is higher than the current S.& P. average multiple of 13 times earnings.
But restoring the old magic will be difficult, many analysts say, because The Journal is the key to the company's success and it is suffering from problems that may be deeper than the cylical pain of a depressed general economy.
The Journal's advertising linage declined 9.3 percent in the first nine months of 1990, and 16 percent in the third quarter.
 
A Thinning Market
But even before the stock market crash and the current advertising trough, advertising volume had begun to decline as the ranks of middle managers - the paper's core market - began to thin because companies were consolidating and eliminating positions.
The Journal also began to face increasing competition from USA Today, the national edition of The New York Times, Investor's Daily and other publications that cut into its franchise on financial advertising.
In recognition of the need to diversify Dow Jones's business, Mr. Phillips steered the company toward electronic publishing of financial data.
In 1985, the company acquired 32 percent of Telerate, a fast-growing company that provides traders in the financial markets with data like price quotes on bonds.
By 1987, Telerate earnings were growing at 45 percent a year and Dow Jones increased its stake to 56 percent, and then 67 percent in 1988. It completed the acquisition this year for a total of $1.6 billion.
But the slowdown in the financial services business in the last few years and intense competition among data suppliers have hurt the information services group. For the first half of 1990, the group, which includes the Dow Jones news service, reported a 44 percent drop in earnings; it declined 36 percent in the third quarter compared with a year earlier.
The poor operating results were heavily influenced by the costs of developing Telerate's electronic system for foreign exchange, called the Trading Service.

HEADLINE: New Rule On Benefits Approved

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
In a move that financial experts say will eventually slash millions of dollars from corporate earnings, the board that makes the nation's accounting rules voted yesterday to require employers to subtract from each year's earnings reports a portion of the costs of the health benefits that they have promised to future retirees.
After 20 months of debate with employers and accountants, who generally accepted the change but lobbied vigorously against potentially costly provisions, the seven-member Financial Accounting Standards Board in a 4-to-3 vote instructed its technical staff to write the rules. They are to be published by the end of the year.
The reason for the change is to make the costs of promised health-care benefits clear to investors and corporate executives and other employees. Most large companies provide some retirement health benefits. 
 
'A Milestone'
Dennis R. Beresford, the board's chairman, said that the rules would be formally adopted in December. ''I don't expect any changes,'' he said, though in theory, changes could be made. He called yesterday's action ''a milestone.''
Most companies have been accounting for benefits to current retirees on a pay-as-you-go basis, but under the new rules, which are to start taking effect in 1993, companies will not be able to wait until costs are incurred. A portion of the expected costs must be taken against each year's reported income.
Accountants and health actuaries will have to estimate the obligation to present and future retirees and report accrued costs as an expense, based on spreading the costs over a number of years.
At the General Motors Corporation, for example, which says it currently spends about $1 billion each year on retiree health benefits, the reported costs will increase, though the actual cash outlays will not be affected by the new rules, Gene Flegm, an assistant controller, said. G.M. also spends $2 billion for present employees' health costs.
 
At Least $227 Billion
Companies will also have to provide an estimate of their total obligation in a footnote to balance sheets. Government officials have estimated that the obligation for all companies will be $227 billion to $400 billion. Richard Ostruw, a vice president in Cleveland with Towers Perrin, a benefits consulting firm, said that $227 billion would cover just the combined obligations of the 1,000 largest companies.
In another vote yesterday at its Norwalk, Conn., headquarters, the accounting standards board rejected efforts by employers to stretch the period of an employee's working career to be used in calculating when retirement will begin. Four board members voted to stand by its rule, which bases the period on when an employee becomes eligible to retire rather than an estimated retirement date. Two members dissented, and one said he would decide later whether to join the majority.
At G.M., Mr. Flegm said, employees are eligible to retire at age 55 but often continue to work until 62. Employers had asked the board to let them estimate the actual retirement dates of their employees.
Some employers and accountants said they were disappointed that the board had not agreed to this change and others that would soften the effects of the rules. But they welcomed changes that the board had accepted since issuing a preliminary version of the rules in February 1989.
''The importrant thing is that there was agreement to go to accrual accounting,'' said Harold Dankner, a Washington partner with Coopers & Lybrand, the accounting and benefits consulting firm.
''While every accountant may find conclusions of the board that he or she would like to change, over all, the board has reached the right conclusions,'' said Benjamin S. Neuhausen, a partner in Chicago with Arthur Andersen & Company, the accounting firm.
Among other changes, the board delayed the rules by one year, to 1993, for large companies and to 1994 for those with fewer than 500 workers. Employers will be permitted to adjust their accounting costs, if they have announced changes in benefit plans that are ''likely to occur.''
The rules were also changed to allow companies to account immediately for costs that otherwise could be spread over 20 years but would be increased by calculations of interest costs.
 
Inflation Rates
But the board rejected an employer request to use general consumer costs as the basis for calculating inflation, rather than the much higher health-care inflation rate.
The board can act by a 4-to-3 majority until Dec. 31. Next year, under a change recently adopted by its governing body, the Financial Accounting Foundation, a 5-to-2 majority will be required. Mr. Beresford said that action on the retiree health issue would probably be completed in December.
A handful of large employers have changed their benefit plans for future retirees to try to limit the liability. Among them are American Telephone and Telegraph, Pillsbury, American Airlines and TRW. Benefits experts said most large companies were studying the issue, particularly as they have become aware of the accounting issues. But Mr. Flehm said the automobile companies had long been sensitive to retiree health costs. ''When you've got $3 billion in cash going out the door, you don't need anybody to tell you about it.'' he said.

HEADLINE: Home Building Off 8th Month in Row

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 17

 BODY:
Construction of new homes fell in September for the eighth straight month, the Commerce Department said today. The slide is the longest in more than 30 years, as activity slowed to a recession-era pace.
Total starts on single-family homes and apartments fell six-tenths of 1 percent last month after a revised 1 percent decline in August, reducing starts to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.14 million units. 
The last time starts were lower was in August 1982, when the annual rate was 1.046 million units. There have never before been eight straight drops in construction activity since the Government started recording the statistics in 1959.
Real estate analysts said the industry had not hit bottom yet, particularly in the Northeast, where home building and sales in New York and Massachusetts have plunged.
''Given the events of the past couple of months, with the invasion of Kuwait, higher interest rates, falling consumer confidence, we expect the housing industry will continue to decline for the next two to three quarters,'' said Dick Peach, an economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association.
 
'Very, Very Bad'
Housing starts fell 11 percent in the Northeast during September and were below levels recorded in the 1981-82 recession. ''The situation in the Northeast is very, very bad,'' said Dave Seiders, an economist for the National Association of Home Builders. ''We're still searching out the bottom there.''
Regionally, the housing picture varied widely. Starts fell 4.4 percent in the West, but they gained 3.3 percent in the Middle West and 3 percent in the South.
Building of single-family homes rose 4.3 percent in September, but that was more than offset by a 14.3 percent drop in apartment construction. Mr. Seiders attributed the apartment decline partly to a less willing attitude on the part of banks and savings institutions to extend credit to contractors.
The department revised the August drop in housing starts to 1 percent from its previously reported 1.7 percent decline.
Total starts last month were 10 percent lower than in September 1989, when they were at a 1.263-million-unit rate; building in the first three quarters of 1990 was also running 10 percent below comparable 1989 levels.
Mr. Seiders said builders hoped the worst was behind them. After a further small decline in the first quarter of 1991 there might be a gradual pickup, he said.
 
Rate Decline Expected
Current mortgage interest rates for 30-year loans that now average 10.66 percent should fall below 10 percent in six months, Mr. Seiders projected, which would aid building activity. Rates now are far below the staggering 15 to 16 percent range for mortgages that were common in the early 1980's when the country was in recession, he noted.
The building industry started 1990 strongly as record warm temperatures in January made construction work easier and starts soared by 23 percent, to an annual rate of 1.57 million units. But building slackened with the return of more normal weather, and home building went into a long tailspin that shows no immediate sign of ending.
Building permits, an indicator of future plans, fell 4.2 percent in September, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.01 million units, after declining 3 percent in August. Permits for single-family homes were down 3.8 percent, to 733,000 units, while permits for apartments fell 5.2 percent, to 273,000 units.
The number of houses started in September totaled 95,400, before seasonal adjustment, compared with 103,800 in August.

HEADLINE: U.S. Output Climbed 0.2% In September

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 17

 BODY:
Industrial production rose two-tenths of 1 percent in September, the Government reported today, with a 7.5 percent spurt in automobile production masking an underlying manufacturing weakness.
The Federal Reserve report was ''loaded by the motor vehicle numbers, which are unsustainable,'' said Robert G. Dederick, chief economist for the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. Excluding autos, the Fed said production dropped one-tenth of 1 percent. 
At the same time, the central bank revised output figures for July and August to show the industrial economy stronger than reported last summer. Production in July was increased from flat to a gain of two-tenths of 1 percent, and August output was changed from a decline of two-tenths of a percent to an advance of one-tenth of a percent.
The Fed also said the operating rate of the nation's factories, mines and utilities was unchanged at 83.6 percent. The operating rate measures not only output but also changes in productivity levels.
''There were a lot of questions about whether we were still growing in the third quarter,'' said David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a New York securities dealer. ''What we had was an economy that was slipping into recession in slow motion.
''We still feel that given the sharp deterioration in consumer and business confidence on the heels of the oil shock, the economy will show negative growth in the fourth quarter.''
 
'Aggressive Rebates'
The 7.5 percent gain in auto output, Mr. Jones said, resulted from ''aggressive rebates that tend to steal from future demand.'' He noted that sales dropped from a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 8.2 million in the last 10 days of September, when incentives were offered, to 6.5 million in the first 10 days of October.
Production at manufacturing plants making both durable and nondurable goods rose two-tenths of 1 percent in September. But the Fed said, ''Apart from the sharp rise in motor vehicle assemblies, manufacturing output dropped two-tenths of 1 percent.''
Indeed, Mr. Dederick said that ''if you look at the components, the declines were fairly widespread.''
Output of durable goods - automobiles and other big-ticket items expected to last at least three years -increased two-tenths of 1 percent, down slightly from a gain of three-tenths of 1 percent in August.
Manufacturing of nondurable goods also gained two-tenths of 1 percent after slipping one-tenth of a percent the previous month.
Output at mines gained four-tenths of 1 percent after slumping 1.7 percent in August. Utility production rose nine-tenths of 1 percent after a 1.3 percent advance in the previous month, in part because of warm weather.

HEADLINE: NCNB's Net Tumbles 60.3%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: CHARLOTTE, N.C., Oct. 17

 BODY:
The NCNB Corporation today reported sharply lower third-quarter earnings, citing problem loans and deterioration in the economy.
The bank reported net income for the quarter of $57 million, or 51 cents a share. That was down 60.3 percent from $143.6 million, or $1.45 a share, in the 1989 period.
''NCNB's earnings this quarter reflect the difficult operating environment facing banks today,'' said Hugh McColl, the chairman of the nation's seventh-largest bank holding company, which has more than $69 billion in total assets.
''Continuing increases in problem loans and loan losses, combined with the continuing deterioration of the U.S. economy, dictate our cautious stance on credit quality issues,'' he said. ''This caution was illustrated by our decision to strengthen our reserve for loan and lease losses by $67 million in the third quarter, to $593 million.''
The bank said the earnings for the current quarter were affected by its decision to place $146.4 million in reserve for loan and lease losses. That's more than twice the $66.3 million placed in reserve in the 1989 quarter.

The MCI Communications Corporation posted a large third-quarter loss yesterday because of a one-time charge against earnings, while three of the seven Bell regionals reported small changes in sales and earnings.
The revenues of MCI, the nation's second-largest long-distance carrier after the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, were lower than expected, said Edward M. Greenberg, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. ''Certainly it's getting tougher to take market share away from A.T.& T.,'' he said.
But O. Gene Gabbard, the chief financial officer of MCI, disagreed. ''It's not any tougher right now, and maybe even a little easier than it was earlier this year or last fall,'' he said. 
Revenue growth in the entire long-distance industry slowed in September as the economy weakened, Mr. Gabbard added.
BellSouth and Pacific Telesis both reported little change in sales and earnings, while Ameritech announced a modest improvement in third-quarter results, in part because of increased revenues from telephone directory advertising, lease financing and other businesses not directly related to local telephone service.
''Any time you get an earnings report that you can look at and say, 'fine,' and file it, that's good news,'' said Jack B. Grubman, an analyst at Paine Webber Inc.
 
MCI
MCI said it lost $168 million on sales of $2 billion in the third quarter, compared with a profit of $165 million, or 62 cents a share, on sales of $1.67 billion in the 1989 period. The loss included a $550 million charge for replacing obsolete equipment. The quarterly earnings are before payment of dividends on preferred stock.
Without the charge, announced on Aug. 21, MCI said it would have earned $180 million for the quarter. MCI's stock fell $1.125 a share, to $29.625, in heavy over-the-counter trading of 5.8 million shares.
Mr. Gabbard, the financial officer, estimated that growth in the long-distance industry slowed to a 10 percent annual rate last month, from 12 to 13 percent earlier in the year. He predicted that growth would not recover this year, but said a contraction of the industry was unlikely. ''We believe it would take a 1930's-type Depression'' to do that,'' he said.
MCI's acquisition on Aug. 14 of Telecom U.S.A., the nation's fourth- largest long-distance network, increased costs, said Mr. Gabbard, the former chairman and chief executive of Telecom.
 
Ameritech
Chicago-based Ameritech, which serves Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin, announced that third-quarter profits grew 7.6 percent, to $311.2 million, or $1.18 a share, from $289.1 million, or $1.06 a share, a year earlier. Sales rose to $2.67 billion, from $2.55 billion in the period last year.
Ameritech's higher earnings compensated for its lackluster growth of 2.8 percent in telephone lines served, well below the national average of about 3.5 percent, said Stephanie Georges, a telecommunications analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. The company's ability to increase earnings faster than revenues is ''definitely evidence you can manage your costs,'' she added.
Shares in Ameritech rose 25 cents each, to $63.50,on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
BellSouth
Third-quarter profits at the BellSouth Corporation dipped to $402.9 million, or 84 cents a share, from $404.4 million, or 84 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales were essentially unchanged, at $3.55 billion.
BellSouth is based in Atlanta and serves nine Southern states, several of which reduced local telephone rates in exchange for giving the company greater flexibility in pricing and investment decisions.
BellSouth added 52,454 new cellular subscribers during the quarter, for a total of 589,614. But Ms. Georges of Salomon Brothers said the company's pace of adding new subscribers was slowing, while profit margins in the cellular business fell as new customers used their phones less than earlier customers.
Shares in BellSouth closed unchanged on the New York Stock Exchange, at $52.
 
Pacific Telesis
Based in San Francisco and serving California and Nevada, the Pacific Telesis Group reported third- quarter earnings of $285 million, or 72 cents a share, on revenues of $2.47 billion. The company earned $278 million, or 68 cents a share, on revenues of $2.37 billion a year earlier.
A $391 million reduction in the rates of its Pacific Bell subsidiary, as part of a new regulatory system in California, depressed the results. Shares in Pacific Telesis rose 25 cents each on the New York Stock Exchange, to $44.

A.T.&T. in Venture To Lay Cable to Japan

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
The largest international telephone companies in the United States and Japan announced plans yesterday to link the two countries in 1996 with a high-capacity undersea cable of radically new design.
The American Telephone and Telegraph Company and Kokusai Denshin Denwa said the new cable would be able to carry 600,000 simultaneous conversations, compared with 40,000 conversations for cables laid in the recent years. The first trans-Atlantic cable, laid in 1956, carried 48 conversations. 
A.T.& T would not estimate the cost of the planned cable, citing uncertainty about the final design and route. The cable would use a new technique for periodically renewing the signal as it crosses the ocean floor. The technique will make it possible for the first time to increase the speed with which calls may be transmitted after the cable has been laid, said Jack M. Sipress, A.T.& T.'s director of research, development and manufacturing for underwater systems.
''The technology A.T.& T. is talking about will certainly be useful,'' said Leland L. Johnson, a senior communications economist at the Rand Corporation. The huge growth in international telephone calls, particularly for facsimile machines, is making large capacity increases necessary, he said.
The new cable should cost no more than existing cables, but the investment cost per line should fall sharply because the new cable can handle more conversations and computer and facsimile data, said William B. Carter, the executive director of A.T.&T.'s international facilities unit. The last significant cable laid, across the Atlantic Ocean in 1988, cost about $360 million, or $9,000 for each of its 40,000 lines.
Fiber-optic cables use lasers to send voice and data through hair-thin strands of glass. But the signals fade with distance and have to be renewed periodically.
Current cables rely on ''repeaters,'' which look like torpedoes and cost about $800,000 apiece. Each repeater receives a light signal, which converts it into an electrical signal, amplifies it and then converts it back into light for transmission to the next repeater.
The planned cable would use recently developed optical amplifiers, which increase the power of a light signal as it passes through a piece of specially treated optic fiber attached to a small laser. The signal is never converted into electricity, allowing for periodic increases in the number of conversations the cable can handle.
Repeaters on current cables are spaced every 40 to 60 miles and soon will be spaced up to 100 miles apart as technology advances, Mr. Sipress said. The optical amplifiers will initially be spaced every 20 to 30 miles, but they are cheaper than repeaters and bigger spacing distances should be possible in the future, he said.
A.T.&T.'s stock fell 75 cents today, to $30.875, on the New York Stock Exchange.
