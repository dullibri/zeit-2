HEADLINE: Stockholm Journal;
In Years Since Palme Killing, a Loss of Innocence

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE 

DATELINE: STOCKHOLM

 BODY:
The site is so modestly marked that it is easy to miss. Perhaps appropriately, one must bow one's head to see it.
The simple brass plaque in the pavement at the Tunnelgatan entrance to the Hotorget subway station reads, "On this spot Sweden's Prime Minister Olof Palme was killed." 
 People by the scores find it daily, though, drawn to the site where many Swedes think their country began to lose its way.
"When Palme was killed, we were an innocent, virgin country," said Nina Ersman, a Swedish diplomat, expressing the common view that the assassination profoundly altered Sweden's view of itself as the unassailable guardian of the world's social conscience.
Mr. Palme, a statesman who aroused intense opinions by speaking out forcefully against apartheid in South Africa, United States actions in the Vietnam War and intolerance in general, was shot in the back by a lone gunman on the night of Feb. 28, 1986, as he was walking home from the movies with his wife.
The 12 years since that convulsive event have not been kind to Sweden's sense of itself as decent, efficient and distant from the tensions and treacheries of the rest of the world. If a certain fatalism took hold of the country at that moment, it has been deepened by the hapless performance of the police, which has left the case still unsolved.
"While the act itself was a national catastrophe, what has turned out to be an enormous setback is that the authorities have been unable to handle the case in a way that has not been open to criticism," said Defense Minister Bjorn von Sydow. "It has proved to be too great an event for our local police."
Arne Ruth, an author and former editor in chief of the newspaper Dagens Nyheter, was more blunt. "After the assassination," he said, "the total failure of the judicial system to handle the case was in a way an even worse disaster for Sweden."
The inquiry has been repeatedly sidetracked by disputes and scandals that have forced the resignations of a Justice Minister, a police chief and other officials.
In recent years, self-styled "private investigators" have produced increasingly bizarre versions of who was behind the killing, variously accusing the Central Intelligence Agency, the Mafia, NATO, Kurdish rebels, the renegade Italian Masonic lodge P-2, the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad, South African defenders of apartheid, local right-wing businessmen, Stockholm police officers angered at wage cuts, a Finnish bodybuilder and an unnamed member of the staff of former President George Bush.
"These are mostly made up by sick people," said Marten Palme, the late Prime Minister's 36-year-old son, who was with his father the night he was killed. "I've had some of them call and apologize to me after they received medication and got better."
Marten Palme, an associate professor at the Stockholm School of Economics, said the remaining family -- his mother, Lisbet, 67, and brothers Joakim, 40, a sociologist, and Mattias, 30, an architect -- were largely able to ignore the continuing furor now. "The most important thing for our family is to know what happened that night," he said, "and we feel we do."
They are convinced that the killer was Christer Pettersson, 51, a confessed drug addict and alcoholic who was convicted of the murder and sentenced to life in prison in 1989 but then freed later that year by an appellate court. He had spent much of the previous 20 years in jail, with a record of 63 arrests, including one for having stabbed a drug dealer to death with a bayonet in 1970.
Swedish criminal law is heavily weighted toward defendants' rights, and the higher court said the evidence used to convict Mr. Pettersson was too circumstantial. He received about $40,000 compensation for wrongful jailing.
An effort by prosecutors to reopen the case against him this spring failed when a Supreme Court panel ruled on May 27 that new witness testimony did not justify a new trial.
The justices also faulted prosecutors for failing to establish a motive or find the .357 Magnum that fired the bullets recovered from the scene. For years police divers have been looking for the pistol in the canals and waterways of Stockholm, a city built on islands in the Baltic Sea.
As for the motive, Swedes have wrestled with reconciling themselves to the notion that a society they long proclaimed to be the world's most rational may have been transformed by a senseless act.
Swedes have burdened the Palme assassination with being the inspiration for a series of unrelated accidents and violent episodes in the last dozen years. It has become a familiar if disjointed recital here -- the sinking of a ferry in 1994 that killed nearly 1,000 people, the machine-gun killing of seven people by a berserk army lieutenant the same year, the attack a year later that killed 4 people and wounded 20 by a young man retaliating with an assault rifle for having been denied admittance to a discotheque.
"The Palme assassination introduced a kind of criminality that we hadn't had before," a Swedish diplomat said.
Toivo Sjoren, research head of the Sipa opinion survey group, said a majority of Swedes thought Mr. Pettersson was the killer and distrusted the conspiracy theories. But the theorists persist.
The night he died, Mr. Palme had gone to the downtown Grand Cinema with his wife, his son Marten and Marten's girlfriend. On leaving, the Palmes said good night to the young couple and turned to walk down Sveavagen, a broad, tree-lined central boulevard. They were headed for the subway station three blocks away to take a train home.
It was not a remarkable thing for a Swedish Prime Minister to move about unprotected, a fact that was to be recalled repeatedly and ruefully after the killing, as permanent security guards were assigned to the country's leaders.
As they passed an artists' supply shop on the corner of Tunnelgatan, a figure emerged from the shadows, fired a shot that passed through Mr. Palme's back and upper chest and a second shot that grazed Mrs. Palme. Then the assassin ran along the dark side street and up a flight of stone stairs at its end two blocks away.
No one has ever come forward to say he or she saw the man fire the gun. At the 1989 trial, Mrs. Palme identified Mr. Pettersson as a man who had glared at her with a hostile expression as her husband lay dying on the snowy street. The accuracy of her recollection was challenged by defense lawyers because three years had passed since the killing.
In court, Mr. Pettersson greeted her claim by shouting out, "Olof Palme is in his heaven, and he would not like what you are saying, but if you believe it, it is O.K.!"
Mr. Pettersson has maintained his innocence, saying that at the time of the shooting he was on a commuter train headed for his suburban home.
The new evidence that prosecutors presented to the Supreme Court in December came from four witnesses, two of whom knew Mr. Pettersson before, who said they had seen him both outside the movie theater and running down the cross street after the shooting.
"The Palme investigation is not over," Lars Nylen, the National Police Commissioner, said in response to the court's refusal in May to permit a new trial. Tuve Johansson, one of 15 detectives still working the case, said his men would continue to seek the weapon and follow up leads.
"We get lots of tips," he said. "They're coming in all the time, but they are mostly ones we have seen before. It's very important to find the weapon." Asked if they were pursuing anyone besides Mr. Pettersson, he said, "We're not investigating just him, but he is a very interesting one."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
From Japan, a Securities Firm With a Spiel of Radical Change

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

 BODY:
Yoshinari Hara, president and chief executive of Daiwa Securities, is on a mission to New York this week to sell ratings agencies, financial institutions and investors on the merits of a purely Japanese securities firm.
It's going to be a hard sell. 
 Japanese securities firms have struggled ever since the bubble economy burst nearly a decade ago. Now, deregulation has made things worse, opening the firms to intense competition from foreign concerns with expertise in products and services they know little about.
Outsiders have already made big gains in Tokyo Stock Exchange trading and pension-fund management. Merrill Lynch has taken over Yamaichi Securities, and Salomon Smith Barney is in a joint venture with Nikko Securities.
Only Nomura Securities, the brawny leader of Japan's securities firms, has a chance to survive as an independent, many analysts suggest.
So in July, when Daiwa, Japan's No. 2 brokerage firm, announced an alliance with Sumitomo Bank, it was greeted with something verging on disappointment.
Sumitomo, Japan's No. 2 bank after the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, is the core of the keiretsu, or business group, that includes Daiwa, and the alliance was largely seen as just another case of circling the wagons.
Moody's Investors Service, which had already put four Daiwa subsidiaries on notice for a possible downgrade, said the announcement did little to dispel its concerns.
"Sure, it lends credibility and substance to the group," Leslie Muranyi, senior analyst at Moody's in New York, said of the alliance. "But it doesn't provide any new products or services, it doesn't create a new management structure, and it doesn't provide a substantial inflow of new ideas and know-how."
And Ayako Sato, an analyst at Warburg Dillon Read, wrote in a report, "We should not expect too much from this merger."
Mr. Hara and his new adviser, Wilbur Ross, a high-profile turnaround strategist at Rothschild Inc., beg to differ. They see room for a purely Japanese firm and say Daiwa is redesigning itself to compete.
"We might get higher marks from overseas markets if we tie up with overseas partners," Mr. Hara said. "But since we will be focusing our business in the Japanese market with Japanese customers and clients, it is their evaluation that is important."
That is only partly true. A downgrade by Moody's would push the ratings of Daiwa's four subsidiaries to junk bond status, greatly raising the cost of borrowing abroad.
And with Japanese companies increasingly reliant on capital markets, not banks, for financing, global investors cannot be ignored.
That is why Mr. Ross was retained. "We wanted to know how we look from the viewpoint of an overseas business consultant," Mr. Hara said.
In Japan, foreign consultants are usually retained merely as window dressing. But so far, Mr. Ross has operated much the way he would if working for an American company, calling reporters, analysts and creditors to sing the praises of the Sumitomo alliance and pushing Mr. Hara to do interviews, including this one.
"This is a huge operation in an industry undergoing immense change," said Mr. Ross, who has branched out from advising creditors in bankruptcy cases to representing some of Asia's deeply troubled corporations. "Daiwa is undergoing probably the most radical change of any of them."
Analysts and reporters, he argued, have missed the fact that the Sumitomo alliance will bring $1.25 billion to $2 billion to Daiwa above and beyond the capital that will be transferred to the three joint ventures Daiwa will form with the bank.
That chunk of change -- which Mr. Ross said would be largely tax-free, when counted against previous tax losses -- would buy Daiwa the technical infrastructure it needs, with enough left over to lure a few foreign professionals to manage new businesses like derivatives and other exotic securities.
Moody's Mr. Muranyi, though, said there was nothing in the numbers he had seen to indicate that Daiwa would get anything close to that amount from Sumitomo. He is expected to meet with Daiwa officials and Mr. Ross soon.
Mr. Ross also said analysts had not taken adequate account of Daiwa's strengths in retail brokerage and investment banking and of the way they would be enhanced by an overhaul.
"They, meaning Daiwa, haven't done a very good job of telling people what this means," he said.
Mr. Muranyi and other analysts agree that theoretically there are benefits to the structure Daiwa is adopting, but they say the proof will be in the pudding.
The alliance is predicated on a reorganization of Daiwa Securities into a holding company, a structure illegal in Japan until recently.
That structure, set to be in place by spring, is regarded at Daiwa as an open invitation to foreign partners, and Mr. Hara says he is in discussions with several foreign firms about running the new asset management subsidiary.
Making an alliance with a separate subsidiary carries far less risk of exposure to the parent's liabilities, which has been a major concern of foreign investors.
Seven subsidiaries will reside under the Daiwa Securities Group umbrella. A retail brokerage firm will be a wholly owned subsidiary while ownership of three other subsidiaries -- in investment banking, asset management and risk management -- will be shared with Sumitomo.
With 300 billion yen in capital, the Daiwa-Sumitomo investment bank will have the biggest cushion in Japan, Mr. Hara said. The combination of Sumitomo's and Daiwa's asset management groups will bring together some 3 trillion yen, or almost $21 billion, in assets -- a drop in the bucket next to the more than $1 trillion controlled by Merrill Lynch but a decent-size pool for Japan.
As a holding company, Daiwa may be better able to control costs by more accurately assessing return on capital for each subsidiary and using the flexibility the structure gives it to cut labor costs.
Mr. Hara regards Daiwa's commitment to the structure as a clear sign of its commitment to new ideas. "It takes a lot of courage to go ahead and establish a holding company when no one else has done it," he said. "But we have decided to become a trend-setter. We have to."

HEADLINE: A Bitter Airline Strike

 BODY:
It is hard to imagine a less sympathetic union than one made up of high-salaried pilots. Northwest Airlines, in a move to exploit that vulnerability, has launched a large advertising campaign denouncing the pilots, saying they get a lot of money for very little work. The pilots have their own, smaller campaign blasting management as being greedy.
This kind of open warfare between management and employees has damaging precedents in the airline industry. The bitter warfare between management and labor at Eastern Airlines ended in the bankruptcy and death of the airline. 
 Northwest's current labor problems have their origin in one of the last great leveraged buyouts of the 1980's. In that transaction, Gary Wilson, now Northwest's chairman, and Al Checchi, who went on to mount an expensive but unsuccessful campaign to be governor of California, took control of the airline.
Northwest soon ran into a crisis caused by the recession that arrived in 1990 and intensified by the company's highly leveraged capital structure. By 1993 the company faced possible bankruptcy, averted only by getting creditors to accept deferred payments and employees to grant givebacks.
Then things turned brighter. The economy recovered, profits in the airline industry improved and there was a boom in Asia, an area in which Northwest has concentrated. Under the 1993 contracts, wages were supposed to snap back to old levels in 1997, as they did, and new contracts were to be negotiated. Those negotiations have failed.
This strike comes at a difficult time for Northwest. The Asian recession has reduced its profitability, and its stock has lost half its value since March. At the same time, management fears that any concessions it makes to the pilots will come back to haunt it in negotiations with other workers. The result is a bitter deadlock particularly damaging to the Midwestern communities where Northwest is the dominant -- in some cases, the only -- carrier.
President Clinton has so far refused to invoke a law that would enable him to impose a 60-day cooling-off period. It is clear that cooling off would help, but it is not as clear that postponing this strike to early November would accomplish much cooling. This is a strike that both sides need to settle -- and on terms that do not result in an embittered work force that will only alienate customers.

HEADLINE: Latin America Is Buffeted, but Seems Stronger Than in '94

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Aug. 31

 BODY:
The demons of financial crisis are haunting Latin America again, unleashed by tumult in Russia, Japan and, now, the United States. Markets and currencies across the region are sinking as panicky investors retreat to the safe haven of American Treasury bonds and dollars.
Most of the major Latin economies are far better fortified to withstand external battering than they were four years ago. That was when a disastrous devaluation in Mexico engulfed several Latin economies into what economists, investors and politicians called the tequila effect. Since then Mexico and Brazil have taken sober measures to build foreign reserves and control inflation, while Argentina and Chile persevered in tough programs already in place. 
 Among the big players only Venezuela failed to buckle down to austerity, and it is now paying the price. Venezuela is in a full-scale emergency, as reserves have been dropping; short-term bank interest rates have been soaring, to 120 percent, and the stock market has fallen, 37 percent in the last month.
Because most of the underlying economies are solid, the turmoil might have milder effects in Latin America than appearances augur, economists and analysts said. But they cautioned that if markets outside the region continued to dive for long or if investors fled the emerging markets en masse without regard to the strengths of individual countries, the outcome could be devastating.
If the slide in the United States results in a sluggish American economy, the damage will be even greater in Latin America, which sends most of its exports to the United States.
As if to demonstrate the point, on a day when the Dow Jones industrial average plummeted 512.61 points, or 6.37 percent, the Mexican stock market was down 5.14 percent.
Mexico canceled a regular Monday auction of Government treasury bills, known as cetes, saying, "The offers received were not consistent with the macroeconomic situation of the country."
It was the first time that Mexico had canceled the auction since the days after the devaluation in 1994.
The leading index of Brazilian stocks was off by 4.06 percent. Even the stock market in stolid Chile was off 3.01 percent. Venezuela, surprisingly, was not hit, with its stock market in a modest rally of 0.18 percent.
"Latin America is the good neighbor in a bad neighborhood," Riordan Roett, director of the Western Hemisphere program at the Johns Hopkins University, said.
The region "should not be affected, but they will be," Mr. Roett said.
A top economist at the Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico, Alejandro Hernandez, said: "Nobody has any really perfect defenses. This is the challenge of the smaller economies in a globalized world."
In 1994 the region's problems were largely self-inflicted, and the United States, then growing robustly, and the International Monetary Fund were ready to step in with loans to help.
Now Latin America is paying for mistakes made in Moscow and Tokyo that rattled the markets and also sent prices for many important Latin commodities like wheat and oil to their lowest real rates in decades. And neither the United States nor the cash-strapped I.M.F. can do much to rescue any country here.
Mexico has done the most to clean up since 1994. Although the peso has slipped -- it recovered slightly today, to 10.02 cents, up 0.4 percent -- many analysts say it is fairly valued.
Oil revenues make up 37 percent of the Government's income, and President Ernesto Zedillo responded quickly to the drop in petroleum prices by slashing the Federal budget three times, maintaining a modest deficit of 1.25 percent of the gross domestic product.
Growth, which boomed in the first half of the year, is generally expected to slow through next year but remain healthy. The Government continues to promise growth of more than 5 percent this year. But economists have revised their estimates down, to 4 and 2.3 percent, by Bursametrica Management in Mexico City.
Interest rates climbed today, to an annualized rate of 38 percent for the overnight cete. But after the drubbing that Mexican banks and indebted citizens took in 1994, far fewer loans are out. Foreign reserves have remained at record highs, with the influx of long-term investment in factories and infrastructure, which now accounts for about 70 percent of foreign investment, helping to keep the reserves strong.
Mexico's big weak spot is its ailing banking system. The Congress, which opens a new session next week, is angrily divided about how to pay for a multibillion-dollar bailout for the banks.
On Sunday three million Mexicans voted against the Government proposal in a symbolic referendum organized by an opposition party, the Party of the Democratic Revolution.
"This is very far from classifying as a crisis," an economist with Latinsource Mexico, Jonathan Heath, said. "There is a lot of noise, a psychological crisis. But while the financial markets are reflecting what is happening in the rest of the world, the real economy continues to grow."
Elsewhere political factors are central. At the outset of the Asian financial crisis in October, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil marshaled through a package of changes that doubled interest rates and imposed steep tax increases and spending cuts.
But the fiscal deficit remains at nearly 7 percent of the economy. The Brazilian currency, the real, is traded in a fixed band and is said by analysts to be overvalued by at least 10 percent. The Central Bank said $7.7 billion left the country in the four weeks before Aug. 28.
Mr. Cardoso appears to determined to forestall any devaluation and even cut interest rates, at least until after elections on Oct. 4. Polls show that he is most likely to win a second four-year term easily in the first round.
Brazil has huge foreign reserves of $72 billion, and several valuable Government properties to sell in a crisis.
"We are going to face this crisis, as always, calmly, without any new package, without any scares," Mr. Cardoso told reporters in a brief appearance on Friday.
Venezuela faces the most severe problems, analysts said, primarily because neither of the two most prominent candidates in presidential elections in December hold much promise of bringing tough solutions to a wayward economy.
The front-runner, Hugo Chavez, 44, is running on a populist platform of broadside repudiation of the political elite for years of economic instability.
Another contender is Irene Saez, 36, a former Miss Universe who has no experience in economics.
Venezuela has done little to reduce its dependence on petroleum, which accounts for three-quarters of exports.
In the longer term, economists are worried that investors' confidence will be so shattered by a new round of losses in the emerging markets that Latin countries will have trouble returning to the international markets to help to pay their debts next year.
"It may be a long time before investors can differentiate and say that Brazil is different from Russia," Sylvia Maxfield, a strategist on emerging markets at Lehman Brothers, said. "We could be in for a period when nobody is willing to touch the emerging markets."

HEADLINE: TURMOIL IN RUSSIA: THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT;
Beyond Personal Faults, The Power of the Office

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, Aug. 31

 BODY:
In the eyes of many of his fellow leaders and ordinary people around the world, President Clinton has lost personal stature since investigations into his private life and his admission of an inappropriate relationship with a White House intern. But he has lost little of the authority and power conferred on him by the Presidency.
Some, particularly in the Muslim world, fear that Mr. Clinton no longer has the moral authority to use his power in ways they would like to see. 
 Others, in the Middle East and Africa, say they believe that he ordered military strikes against reported terrorist targets in the Sudan and Afghanistan to divert attention, and that he may be tempted to respond similarly in future crises.
But leaders everywhere say that whatever Mr. Clinton's private life, his position as leader of the world's most powerful economy and the only military superpower makes him indispensable in dealing with international problems from terrorism to turmoil in Russia.
New York Times correspondents on five continents report that the people, regardless of their personal feelings about Mr. Clinton, stand in awe of the power of the Presidency -- if somewhat less in awe of the character of the man now occupying the office.
But because Mr. Clinton has been taken down a notch in the last month, leaders in some countries are quicker than usual to take issue with American policies.
For example, one high-ranking European official criticized the President's determination to travel to Russia in the face of the political and economic turmoil that has hobbled President Boris N. Yeltsin. "It's a completely useless meeting," the official said, "but neither Yeltsin nor Clinton could afford to be the first to say, 'Let's call it off.' "
The worst outcome of the Russian crisis, most European leaders agree, would be abandonment by Moscow of a commitment to democracy and to a free-market economy. In their eyes, despite the personal revelations, Mr. Clinton is still capable of conveying that the West will continue its support if Russia keeps trying.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, who is fighting against the odds for re-election on Sept. 27, would have perhaps the most to lose if Russia changed course; the German Government and banks have lent billions to Moscow.
As Mr. Kohl said in a television interview a week ago: "Bill Clinton is the No. 1 in the world. Whatever American domestic politics are, he has his responsibilities. In contact with Russia, Indonesia or Japan, to name only a few problem areas, it's absolutely necessary. There is no letup, not for the President of the United States."
President Jacques Chirac of France referred to his "personal friendship" for Mr. Clinton in a speech to French ambassadors in Paris last week. But he also ticked off a list of differences between the United States and France, saying Washington had an isolationist and unilateral streak that complicated international issues.
Everywhere, it seems, there is bafflement about a country where a President's foes can use his sex life to attack him politically. "Is this an advanced form of democratic political conduct?" the French Foreign Minister, Hubert Vedrine, mused.
John Biehl del Rio, chief of staff to President Eduardo Frei of Chile, said, "Outside the United States, we do not give this issue the same importance. We are all praying, or at least crossing our fingers, that he is not hurt by this. The world faces a recession, and the United States is holding the economy of the world together almost alone."
The Mexican writer Jorge Castaneda said, "There are a lot of problems in the world that only the U.S. can fix, and there's a sense among Mexicans that there wouldn't be this worldwide mess if there was somebody in charge in Washington.
"How can a successful President who has brought prosperity and well-being to the U.S. be weakened, destroyed or crippled by this silly story?"
Tumi Mahabane, deputy editor of Y, a magazine for young people in South Africa, said: "I don't think people should look to presidents for moral authority. Presidents should steer countries. Their morality is peripheral."
But in the Arab world, the dominant view is that Mr. Clinton's relationship with the intern, Monica S. Lewinsky, has weakened the Presidency and Washington's ability to press Israel to negotiate with the Palestinians. "It is no longer possible to plan any policy with them," said a senior official in Saudi Arabia.
It is widely thought in some Muslim countries that Ms. Lewinsky was an Israeli agent placed in the White House. Without his troubles over her, some Palestinian and other Arab officials contend, Mr. Clinton might have been willing to criticize Israel earlier this year for not agreeing to an American proposal for an accord with the Palestinians.
Hemi Shalev, a commentator for the Israeli newspaper Maariv, wrote: "The weakening of the President was a boon to the right wing. They quickly translated Bill Clinton's troubles into local currency and reached the conclusion that a President up against the boards is one who cannot pressure Israel to implement the second redeployment."
Reaction in much of the Islamic world was also critical of the bombings in the Sudan and Afghanistan, and inclined to see a connection with Ms. Lewinsky.
Sarote Phaksumlee, a leader of Ban Krua, the biggest Muslim community in Bangkok, Thailand, said: "The timing is very strange. Nobody has heard of Osama bin Laden before," a reference to the Saudi who Washington says planned the bombing of American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
"It is obvious the attack is staged to divert attention from Bill Clinton's sex scandal," Mr. Phaksumlee said. "If America can do what it did in the Sudan and Afghanistan, tomorrow it can bomb northern Thailand by saying we are growing opium and manufacturing heroin and exporting it to America."
Dr. Mansor Mohammad Noor, former leader of a fundamentalist Islamic group in Malaysia and now a lecturer at University Science Malaysia, said: "Clinton has discredited himself even though he might be right. The greatest error is that Clinton is sowing fear among people throughout the world. He has shown the might of the United States and it can hammer anyone anywhere.
"The United States can bomb anyone anywhere. This is a very dangerous precedent: the world is at the mercy of America. Clinton has frightened the world. A frightened world is a dangerous world."
But Mukhtar Baki Kizginkaya, the leader of Emirgan, an Istanbul neighborhood, offered a different opinion: "Clinton is a very valuable man. He did what was necessary in the Sudan, responding to terrorism."
Whatever the outcome of his trip to Russia, Mr. Clinton can apparently expect a warm welcome afterward in Ireland, where he is very popular. He plans to visit both North and South, then relax for a few days to play golf before he goes back to Washington.

HEADLINE: Decline in New-Home Sales Is a Bit Steeper Than Expected

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 31

 BODY:
Sales of new homes fell more than expected during July, a sign that the housing market may be settling down after its record growth in June.
The Commerce Department said today that sales of new single-family homes declined 1.6 percent in July, to 886,000 units at an annual rate. The increase in June, which was originally reported as a 935,000-unit annual rate, was revised downward to a 1.1 percent gain, or an annual pace of 900,000 units, still a record. 
 Analysts had expected an 929,000-unit annual rate for new-home sales in July. Still, they said the July decrease, although larger than expected, did not point to significant weakness in housing activity. Over the last four months, the annual rate of new-home sales has stayed between 886,000 and 900,000 units.
The July statistics still "indicate a lot of strength" in housing activity, said Marilyn Schaja, an economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities in New York. Sales near the 900,000-unit level "are more sustainable" than the 935,000 units previously reported for June, she said.
Demand for labor is strong, incomes are steady, consumers are confident and interest rates are low. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in August was about 6.92 percent, down from 6.95 percent in July and 7 percent in June.
New-home sales in July rose 1.4 percent in the South, to a 432,000-unit annual rate. They fell 11.7 percent in the Midwest, to a 144,000-unit rate; four-tenths of 1 percent in the West, to a 236,000-unit rate, and 1.3 percent in the Northeast, to a 74,000-unit rate.
The median price of new homes rose to $147,900, from $145,800 in June.
The inventory of new homes for sale at the current sales pace rose to a four-month supply in July from a revised 3.9-month supply in June. The low supply of new homes suggests builders will be busy through the end of the year, analysts said.

HEADLINE: Reporter at The Times to Receive Award for Decades of Journalism

 BODY:
A reporter for The New York Times has won the 1998 John Chancellor Award for Excellence in Journalism, the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania plans to announce today.
John Kifner, 56, now a metropolitan reporter for The Times, won for the body of his work, for both foreign and domestic reporting. The Annenberg School for Communication, which administers the award, cited his ability to translate "complicated changes in the political, economic and cultural landscape for American readers." 
 In more than 30 years at The Times, Mr. Kifner covered the Iranian revolution, the Persian Gulf war and the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin. He also covered the 1968 Democratic convention, the Kent State shootings, the busing crisis in Boston and the Oklahoma City bombing. He won two George Polk Awards, most recently in 1989 for his coverage of the Palestinian uprising.
A seven-member committee of journalists and others chose the winner. Sander Vanocur, a veteran television journalist, said, "We wanted to honor a working reporter who was still slugging it out -- who gives you facts over punditry."
Jack Nelson, chief Washington correspondent of The Los Angeles Times, said, "I've had to compete against him; I know he's hard-hitting."
The award is given in honor of John Chancellor, the NBC television correspondent and anchor who died in 1996, and will be presented at a dinner in Philadelphia on Oct. 21. It carries a $25,000 prize.

HEADLINE: At N.Y.U., the Clintons, Gore and a Mini-United Nations

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
In what is shaping up as a remarkable lineup of domestic and foreign leaders at New York University, President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton have agreed to lead a day of discussions on the global economy at a conference later this month, with guests including the prime ministers of Britain and Italy, the White House said yesterday.
Vice President Al Gore is also likely to attend the daylong session at the New York University School of Law, a White House official said on condition of anonymity. University officials said the event would be an historic concentration of political power in Greenwich Village. 
 The Sept. 21 event coincides with the opening session of the United Nations General Assembly, which accounts for the university's success in drawing other heads of government to Mr. Clinton's afternoon discussion. The law school dean, John Sexton, is a longtime friend of the President and Mrs. Clinton, which in part accounts for the Clintons' agreement to appear.
The conference promises to be a notable moment even for this President. Although Mr. Clinton has repeatedly demonstrated an affinity for extended discussions of policies with scholars -- this one will go at least 90 minutes, Mr. Sexton said -- it is the first time he has attempted something like this with a panel of foreign dignitaries.
It also promises to be a notable moment for the N.Y.U. School of Law, which is sponsoring the forum, titled "Strengthening Democracy in the Global Economy." If all goes according to plan, a group of its students, selected by lottery, and faculty members will in the space of the day witness a morning seminar led by the First Lady, a luncheon speech by Mr. Gore, and an afternoon discussion of international affairs with a panel that is to include, at least, Mr. Clinton, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and Romano Prodi, the Prime Minister of Italy. The leaders of Canada, Brazil, Bulgaria, Sweden and the Netherlands have also been asked to attend, school officials said.
The conference promises to be interesting for both political and logistical reasons. As a rule, the General Assembly's opening sessions, with their influx of foreign dignitaries, motorcades and security details, bring traffic tie-ups and disruption to the streets and sidewalks around the United Nations. The conference promises to extend that confusion to Greenwich Village.
And the fact that Mr. and Mrs. Clinton will be attending the same conference, though not necessarily appearing together, during a time of public scrutiny of their private life could mean an unusual amount of attention to a conference devoted to the arguably dry theme of global economics and politics.
Whatever the case, White House and N.Y.U. officials said they were delighted with the way the conference was shaping up. University officials said it would draw attention to the new Global Law School Program, which is devoted to the study of how democratic governments have been affected by the global economy.
And Mr. Clinton's aides said it would give the President a chance to be spotlighted talking about policy.
Each of the discussions will be open to about 275 people, including the students, faculty members and outside guests invited by the university. "We are aiming for a sizable group of people from the general intellectual, business and labor community," said Prof. Norman Dorsen, the chairman of the Global Law School Program.
Members of the audience will be allowed to ask questions or make comments, either by passing the questions forward on sheets of paper or by going to an open microphone.
Mrs. Clinton will lead the morning forum, which will be called "Civil Society and the Future of Democracy."
Mr. Clinton will lead the afternoon forum, which will be a general discussion by the government leaders on themes that were raised during the day.
"What the President will talk about -- your guess is as good as mine, if I may be only slightly facetious," Professor Dorsen said.
Mr. Clinton's communications aide, Sidney Blumenthal, said the President's discussion would be devoted to "strengthening democracy in the world economy. Globalization. Everything from a civil society to how you create more opportunity for people in the new economy. How you respond to new realities."
"There's never been an event like this," Mr. Blumenthal said.

HEADLINE: THE MARKET TURMOIL;
Mexican Stocks Fall Sharply Over Interest Rate Concerns

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Aug. 31

 BODY:
Mexican stocks tumbled for the eighth day out of nine as traders dumped securities on concerns rising interest rates will stall the consumer spending engine that's been driving economic growth.
The Bolsa index fell 162.21, or 5.14 percent, to 2991.93, its lowest level in more than two years. The index plunged 37 percent in dollar terms this month. 
 "Everybody is talking about significantly slower growth in 1999 and that's part of what the market is considering," said James Barrineau, a Latin American equity strategist with Salomon Smith Barney.
The rout was lead by retailers as higher interest rates threaten to dry up consumer purchases on credit.
Overnight rates on Treasury bills shot up 650 basis points, to 38.50 percent, their highest level since March 20, 1996. An auction of Government debt scheduled for today was canceled, the central bank said, but it did not give a reason why.
Rates on the benchmark 28-day Treasury bill were expected to jump 824 basis points, to 35.40 percent, their highest level in two years.
Retailers were also hurt after an industry trade group said supermarket sales rose 2.5 percent in July from the same month a year earlier. Even though July's sales rose at a faster pace than 1.6 percent in June, the pace was smaller than in May and April, hinting that consumer demand is slowing.
A plunge in United States stocks also dragged down Mexican shares as United States investors dumped Mexican American depository shares in a 512-point selloff of the Dow Jones industrial average.
 Telefonos de Mexico S.A., which makes up about a quarter of the Bolsa index, dropped 4.7 percent, to 35.6875 in New York trading.
Investors continued to pull money out of Mexican securities as a Russian devaluation and threat to renege on debt drives up risk in other emerging markets. On the year, the Bolsa index has dropped 54 percent in dollar terms.

HEADLINE: GRADING THE SECRETARY: A special report.;
Albright, a Bold Voice Abroad, Finds Her Role Limited at Home

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Aug. 31

 BODY:
With her bold public stands undermined by irresolution in the White House and her experience rendered less relevant by new economic crises, Madeleine K. Albright has had a tough 20 months as Secretary of State.
Ms. Albright remains the Clinton Administration's principal foreign-policy voice and the liaison with a recalcitrant Republican Congress, and is greeted like a celebrity very popular in the country beyond Washington. But a President averse to military risk, preoccupied by the fallout from his relationship with an intern and unwilling to offend core Democratic constituencies has not supported her on key issues like the Middle East and Kosovo. 
 Her assiduous courtship of Congress was instrumental in winning Senate ratification of NATO expansion and the Chemical Weapons Convention from a Congress verging on isolationism. But Ms. Albright has had little to do with the few other Clinton successes of the second term: a settlement in Northern Ireland and a reinvigoration of relations with China.
And now, as Russia melts, tainting one of the relationships of which Mr. Clinton has been proudest, this is a particularly vulnerable period for the Administration's foreign policy. Russia was part of widening international crisis that has now hit Wall Street, threatening the booming economy that has kept his popularity afloat.
But Ms. Albright and the State Department have not been crucial players, White House officials say. With Mr. Clinton so distracted, it is not immediately clear who is in charge.
The evidence appears to favor the national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, and the Treasury Secretary, Robert E. Rubin, though, instead of Ms. Albright.
In a recent interview, Ms. Albright bristled at specific criticism, but says it is only natural that the economic experts take the lead on their issues.
"For me, what's important is what people think in years hence," Ms. Albright said. "Whether I used this four-year period in a way that ultimately accomplished what I want: to create the underpinnings for the American role in the next century, while taking care of what needs to be done to problem-solve."
Ms. Albright attended only one recent meeting of the National Economic Council, the functional equivalent of the National Security Council, and that was on Japan.
She and her officials did regularly urge a broader view of American interests in Asia than simply the financial, including security and the stabilization of democratizing Asian allies, and coordinated interagency aid packages for Thailand and Indonesia.
But her call for President Suharto of Indonesia to step down occurred only hours before he did so anyway, and in general, Ms. Albright and her department have let Treasury run the show.
Was this an opportunity missed, or simply, as Ms. Albright and her aides contend, the most efficient and collegial way to coordinate a post-Soviet world with new, nontraditional challenges?
In the Middle East, on the other hand, Ms. Albright has been central, trying to coax and cajole Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel into a compromise that would refresh a deterioriating peace and help restore American credibility in the Arab world. But her intensive efforts have not yet produced the clear personal triumph that zero-sum Washington seems to require.
In May, she gambled that public pressure and an ultimatum would move Mr. Netanyahu, but the White House failed to support her in the face of a lobbying firestorm stoked by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.
She kept the Administration engaged in Bosnia, where it could not reasonably retreat.
Here in Sarajevo on Sunday and again today, Ms. Albright spoke passionately and effectively about the effort required to make a multinational, democratic Bosnia come to pass, and she was eager to make it vividly clear that American aid would only come to those who worked to carry out the Dayton accords.
But her advocacy of an aggressive approach -- including a credible threat of air strikes -- toward the Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic, over his crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo Province did not find wide support within NATO and was rejected by Mr. Clinton in the spring.
Her vow in March that "we are not going to stand by and watch the Serbian authorities do in Kosovo what they can no longer get away with doing in Bosnia" has proven hollow.
Other American threats have seemed equally empty -- against Iraq to defend United Nations weapons inspections, for example.
That has called into question the American commitment to a sustained war on terrorism, a commitment Ms. Albright and others pledged would begin with the missile strikes against Afghanistan and Sudan.
 
Some Early Victories For a New Secretary
Ms. Albright's accession as Secretary of State, becoming the highest-ranking woman in American history, prompted enormous popular and media interest. She attracted attention for her newly discovered Jewish background as well as for successful efforts to expand NATO and to her push to articulate a more forceful American position than her dry, quiet predecessor, Warren M. Christopher.
She quickly earned respect from her French, Russian, Chinese and Arab colleagues. Early victories in Congress were hailed, and she has won important policy shifts on Iran and Cuba, while helping to prevent a trade war with Europe over sanctions.
But with domestic problems undercutting Mr. Clinton's international credibility, the Administration foreign policy seems ever more reactive. And with the bombing of American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, followed by missile strikes in Afghanistan and the Sudan, with civil war in Kosovo, nuclear tests by India and Pakistan, the Russian economic and political problems and the unresolved crisis in Iraq flaring again, the world seems a more dangerous and unstable place than when Ms. Albright came to office.
Ms. Albright's greatest virtues -- clarity and an intelligent, forceful voice connecting with the public and Congress -- have not diminished, said a senior White House official who admires her. But as the Administration faces diverse and less manageable problems, many due to the economic problems that began in Asia, "her virtues seem less impressive or timely," the official said, "because neither economics nor strategy are her strengths, and her depth lies in European issues, not Asian ones."
Even Ms. Albright's hard work with Congress -- in particular with Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina -- has not yet produced a deal to repay Washington's debt to the United Nations or funds to replenish the International Monetary Fund reserves, both described as high priorities by her aides. Compromises have been stymied by a fight with House Republicans over abortion policy.
"My predecessors had a different world to deal with in which the parameters were fairly set," Ms. Albright said. "They had the possibility of focusing all their attention on one or two issues." By contrast, she said, she is trying to "put into play a lot of issues that I see as challenges we're facing," like nuclear nonproliferation, economics and the effective use of sanctions, issues that were at the center of a January review of priorities.
 
The Land Mines And the War Crimes
Ms. Albright has failed to achieve some of the human-rights goals she described as among the most important to her. She was an early champion of a ban on land mines. Last year, however, in Ottawa, the United States was nearly alone in opposing a treaty.
As a Central European whose family fled first the Nazis and then the Communists, she has been especially concerned about crimes against humanity. She created an Ambassador for War Crimes and lobbied for a permanent international tribunal to prosecute them.
But at a Rome conference to accomplish that goal, the United States was part of a small minority refusing to sign a treaty to create a permanent tribunal. In both cases, the Pentagon and Congress successfully argued that the only superpower required special exceptions.
Ms. Albright said she continues to champion her principles, but she cannot forget America's responsibilities. "I have to balance enunciating the principles and leading the way with the pragmatism of getting things done and the power of the United States," she said.
But there is now a new expression in diplomatic circles -- "to pull an Ottawa" -- which means to promote a new initiative and then abandon it at the end.
Ms. Albright's fierce rhetorical battles with the Iraqis at the United Nations helped catapult her into the Secretary's elegant office on the seventh floor. And in a corridor leading off from it, she keeps a comic shrine, a collection of cartoons, newspaper cuttings and other mementos of her tussles with Iraq.
But the Iraq problem persists. The latest crisis is an outgrowth of the inconclusive standoff last March, which did little for the reputation of Mr. Clinton's foreign-policy team.
Iraq continues to serve as a reminder of the limits of American power, of the post-Soviet difficulties in orchestrating allies and of the continuing reluctance of Mr. Clinton to use force in risky circumstances.
 
The Big Fiasco In Columbus
But the televised town hall meeting in Columbus, Ohio, in February, was the most visible fiasco. Ms. Albright and Mr. Berger, the security adviser, and Defense Secretary William S. Cohen were unable to silence hecklers or to sound convincing about why a nearly isolated United States might need to bomb Iraq.
The Ohio meeting -- organized by the White House to use Ms. Albright's skills and popularity -- began the erosion of her reputation among the foreign-policy elite of which she has been a member for so long.
"If you look around the world for the big challenges now, where's the Secretary of State?" asked Robert B. Zoellick, former Under Secretary of State for James A. Baker 3d, who enjoyed a level of access to his President, George Bush, and influence over him that seems denied to Ms. Albright. "To an outsider, she's M.I.A. People run issues case by case, but there's a sense the show is being managed by Berger."
The Administration manages crises but has no clear strategic framework, Mr. Zoellick said. "How do different problems relate to one another? It starts with the President, but it's not her forte or Berger's. If you don't have a sense of where you want to take the country, you won't get there."
Michael Mandelbaum, of Johns Hopkins University, who criticized first-term foreign policy as "social work," thinks the current team is doing decently at managing the smaller crises of the post-cold-war era, which have less to do with national security and diplomacy.
"Certainly in this second presidential term, by far the most important figures in foreign policy" are Treasury Secretary Rubin and his deputy, Lawrence H. Summers, Mr. Mandelbaum said. "For that we should be grateful. A world with a financial crisis is far safer than a world with a military crisis, and they've been doing pretty well. But Albright doesn't seem to be a player in all this."
 
Success With China: Who Gets Credit?
Richard N. Haass of the Brookings Institution, who was on the National Security Council staff under President Bush, said "the one significant accomplishment in the second term" has been to renew relations with China. "There you can see a policy initiative and presidential investment," he said. "One senses that the engine for that has been the President and the National Security Council."
In the interview, Ms. Albright defended her involvement and that of her strong team in the full range of foreign policy, from Asia and China to Iran and Cuba. On financial matters, she said, she has been working to insure that the diplomatic, human and security aspects are fully grasped.
As a former academic, she has been happy to reach down to the regional assistant secretaries and to urge them "to think outside the box," wanting career officers to compete for ideas with outsiders. She has encouraged Under Secretaries Thomas R. Pickering and Stuart E. Eizenstat, and Deputy Secretary Strobe Talbott, "to drive policy and make things happen," an official said.
"Economic issues we have brought right into the department," Ms. Albright said, "and we have an Under Secretary who's strong -- Stu Eizenstat -- really working on sanctions issues and on trying to meld the financial with the assistance part of the Asian financial crisis."
She has pushed hard, as she promised him she would, Mr. Eizenstat said, to make State a serious player again on economic issues. Treasury gets the headlines over Asia, he said, "but we and she have been intimately involved with the humanitarian and political dimensions."
She is confident about her managing role as Secretary of State, as the prime foreign-policy spokesman for the Administration and as a formulator of key policy. And she rejects the notion that Mr. Clinton's choice of Richard C. Holbrooke to be chief American delegate to the United Nations -- someone who was said to have been a candidate for Secretary of State before Ms. Albright was chosen -- is a sign that her own star is waning or wanting.
"Washington is what it is," she said, shrugging. "People think you're terrific, and then they think you're too terrific, so then they let you know that you're not. You can't be in a position of being the visible voice for the United States and not be out there to be praised and criticized."
Ms. Albright and Mr. Berger have a friendship dating back to the presidential campaign of Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts, when Ms. Albright was the chief foreign-policy adviser to a candidate who took almost unremitting heat for not having a strong foreign-policy view. Despite moments of annoyance -- usually over personnel -- presidential briefings or second-guessing about the results of specific diplomatic missions, Ms. Albright and Mr. Berger are each other's closest advisers. They hash out policy in advance and speak many times a day -- a sharp contrast to the tension between Mr. Christopher and Anthony Lake, or the raging warfare under Jimmy Carter -- the last Democratic President -- between Cyrus R. Vance and Zbigniew Brzezinski.
 
Albright and Berger Are Both Pragmatists
"This is not the foreign-policy President who wakes up thinking what notes he can pen to his foreign colleagues," a senior Administration official said, a reference, apparently, to Mr. Bush, who was famous for his hand-written correspondence to world leaders. "So Berger becomes the guy who doesn't make foreign policy so much as broker it."
In meetings, another senior White House official said, "she is pragmatic and a consensus builder, like Berger, despite her reputation outside as an uncompromising, six-gun shooting moralist." She arrives well-briefed and armed with a collective department view, in contrast to Mr. Cohen, whose well-armed Pentagon often gets its way regardless. She is "articulate on issues she knows well, and tends to put aside the talking points and draw from her own experience, and she's best when she does that."
Ms. Albright dealt movingly with the emotional and security crisis surrounding the bombing of the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and the deaths of many of her employees, and she has handled Mr. Clinton's personal troubles with dignity.
But her finest policy moment lately has been a shift in the treatment of Iran after the election of the moderate Mohammad Khatami as President. While maintaining demands for a halt to terrorism and Iran's nuclear, chemical and missile programs, she pushed Mr. Clinton to a more receptive Iran policy.
"It was hard and had internal criticism, but she got it done with Sandy and the President," avoiding an interagency battle, an official said.
After her recent speech laying out the new policy -- to which Iran has not yet responded -- the President took her aside to congratulate her, she said, "for threading the needle."
Similarly, she used contacts with Pope John Paul II, the Congress and Cuban exiles in Miami to allow direct relief flights from the United States to Cuba to resume and to let relatives send money.
Ms. Albright is also praised for her work with the Russian Foreign Minister, Yevgeny M. Primakov, which helped forge a new relationship between NATO and Russia.
At one point, aides remember, as Mr. Primakov argued for secondary military status for new NATO members, Ms. Albright said: "Neither the President nor I will negotiate over the heads of the peoples of Central Europe. That happened once before and it's not going to happen again."
Mr. Primakov was silent, then diverted the conversation, and never pressed the issue so hard again, the aides say.
But Russian policy is generally run by Mr. Talbott and is dominated by the economic and political crisis, making Mr. Primakov -- and Ms. Albright -- less important.
Ms. Albright also pushed the Pentagon to act more decisively in support of political goals in Bosnia and to keep troops there without a deadline.
Her conversations with the Bosnian Serb President, Biljana Plavsic, were crucial in encouraging her to challenge Radovan Karadzic.
On Kosovo, she argues that -- unlike in Bosnia -- Washington and NATO were involved early and got Europe to act. A resolution is not yet clear, she says, but the ground is prepared.
Ms. Albright is also proud of using her unprecedented telephone relationship with the Chinese Foreign Minister to organize the Security Council's five permanent members -- the United States, Russia, China, France and Britain -- to condemn nuclear tests by India and Pakistan.
At their June meeting in Geneva, she told the others that they are "always talking about a multipolar and not a unipolar world."
This was their chance to prove it, she said, "so one country doesn't take a principled stand and the others sign up the contracts."
 
She Will Await History's Judgment
With all the "profound ideological confusion" facing a post-cold-war Secretary of State, said Moises Naim, editor of Foreign Policy, this is not a period for "grand strategy." Ms. Albright's role, he said, is inevitably one of a goalkeeper.
But Secretaries of State are often defined by challenges. Mr. Baker, for instance, had a great crisis thrust upon him, the Persian Gulf war, and a great opportunity, the collapse of Communism.
So far, Ms. Albright has not had such a test or made such an opportunity of the growing world economic problems.
"I can't operate on the basis of instant gratification on any part of my daily work," she said.
"The policies that are being put into place are longer term. It may be the next Secretary of State will reap the rewards of what I've done. Sitting in this chair you get the sense that you are a part of history."
She noted her recent induction into the national Women's Hall of Fame. "When they say I'm the highest-ranking woman in the history of the United States, that's pretty amazing. I don't mind occasionally having someone criticize me."
Judith Kipper of the Council on Foreign Relations, while a fierce critic of United States Middle East policy, praises Ms. Albright for showing the way.
"She can be soft with her children, motherly and nice, and go shopping and be all the things a decent person can be," Ms. Kipper said.
"But when it comes to the work, she's tough and serious. There's no gender in the work."

HEADLINE: Strike Apparently Settled, Workers Return to U S West

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: DENVER, Aug. 31

 BODY:
With nonunion companies competing hungrily for telephone business in booming cities of the Rockies, U S West tentatively settled a two-week-old strike today, putting employees back to work at the region's Bell company.
The settlement, which faces a ratification vote by the 34,000 striking members of Communications Workers of America, gives workers gains in pay and pension benefits, among other things, and allows for a voluntary pay-for-performance program. 
 The deal came as U S West is scrambling to keep control of an exploding market in fax, pager and telephone lines in Denver. Starting Tuesday, all local calls made within the Denver area will require 10-digit dialing. In October, greater Denver is to get a second area code, 720.
"The Bell companies are preparing to face increased competition from fairly lean, nonunion companies going after their market share," said Boyd Peterson, an analyst with The Yankee Group, a telecommunications research company in Boston.
Mr. Peterson said that although U S West remained strong -- its stock fell only seven-sixteenths of a point today in the face a sharp market decline -- it could not afford a protracted fight with an equally strong union.
Earlier this month, Bell Atlantic reached a settlement after only a two-day strike by the Communications Workers of America. In Connecticut last week, workers from that union rejected a contract offer by the Southern New England Telecommunications Corporation.
"C.W.A. is probably doing better than any union in the country," said Gregory Tarpinian, executive director of the Labor Research Association, a New York consulting company for unions. "They have a tremendous amount of leverage because most of the telecom companies downsized in the mid-80's and early 90's."
At U S West, the number of employees dropped to 53,000 this year, from 66,000 in 1984, the year of the company's creation. The strike found the company without enough mid-level managers to perform unionized tasks -- directory assistance, repair and installation. At the same time, the region's urban customers enjoy unprecedented choices for phone service in the deregulated environment caused by the Telecommunications Act of 1996.
Faced with a tight labor market -- unemployment in the U S West service area is nearly one percentage point below the national average of 4.5 percent -- and an increasingly competitive business environment, U S West agreed to wage increases of 10.9 percent over three years, slightly above inflation forecasts. In addition, it agreed to cut in half mandatory overtime, to a maximum of eight hours a week by January 2001.
On the most contentious issue, the company agreed to make a pay-per-performance incentive plan voluntary for eligible employees. Before the strike, the company had sought to make this plan mandatory for new workers as a way of improving efficiency and making the company more "customer friendly."
The union considered the company's final position on the pay-for-performance issue as a victory.
"Pay for performance is totally voluntary," Sue Pisha, vice president of Communications Workers of America District 7, said today, adding that the union "is not going to recommend that our members get in that plan."
But David Beigie, a U S West spokesman, called the union's acceptance of even a voluntary plan as "a breakthrough for the industry."
In a company where union workers on average earn $37,900 annually, some may go for the extra money.
The three-year contract, which also includes a 21 percent increase in pension benefits and a $500 ratification bonus, is expected to be ratified by the company's rank and file in September. Ms. Pisha said that on Sunday night, officials of the 65 striking locals "overwhelmingly" supported the new contract. All strikers are expected to back at work by midweek.
The strike affected service to about 25 million customers in 14 states. Because of automation, phone service was largely uninterrupted, though customers did encounter problems in trying to get directory assistance, new service and repairs.
Reflecting the retail nature of a telephone company, both sides in the strike sought to win public opinion with competing opinion polls and newspaper and television advertisements.
Although there was no major violence on picket lines, the company reported 130 incidents of vandalism during the 15-day strike.

HEADLINE: Not Your Grandfather's State Fair;
Leaping Llamas and Low-Cal Jams in an Agrarian Bastion

SERIES: RITES OF SUMMER: At the Fair

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI 

DATELINE: SYRACUSE, Aug. 31

 BODY:
Just next door to the display of the state's largest squash and only a flight of stairs above the room where assorted jams vied for glory, Kate Broderick struck a pose.
Her exuberantly purple gown was neither the worst nor the best of the 42 outfits worn by as many teen-agers in a fashion revue Saturday morning at the New York State Fair, but Miss Broderick, 16, of Rensselaer County, stood out nonetheless. Unlike most of the other 4-H Club girls and boys on the stage, she had not stitched, dyed, beaded or brocaded what she was wearing. 
 The totality of her accomplishment had been to purchase it for a really, really good price.
As she sidled back and forth, beaming and iridescent, an announcer explained that Miss Broderick had sought an affordable dress and had come across this one "when she was almost about to give up."
"She was stunned to find that the price was only $29.99," the announcer marveled. "She just couldn't beat it."
Intrepid shopping on a par with intricate sewing? It spoke volumes not only about the tenor of the times, but also about the way the New York State Fair has endeavored to keep pace with them.
For many city slickers familiar with state fairs only through old movies or television programs, the annual, end-of-summer events are anachronistic bastions of quaint pastoralism. To some extent, that's accurate.
The wonders of cultivation, from monstrous zucchini to mammoth swine, are still celebrated. The divine arts of pickling, canning, cookie baking and jelly making still garner intensely coveted blue ribbons.
But while the 152d New York State Fair includes cows trotted out by breeders eager to show off their livestock, it also features llamas leaping over a gradually raised bar for no purpose other than entertainment.
And while there are displays paying tribute to the homespun ingenuity behind hat decorating and flower arranging, there are also events and exhibitions honoring bicycle acrobatics, chain-saw sculpturing and, in Miss Broderick's case, keen-eyed trips down the aisles of Marshall's.
"We take everybody into account when we prepare the fair," said Peter Cappuccilli Jr., the director of the New York State Fair. "We've had to make it interesting for all people."
The numbers suggest that fair officials have succeeded. Last year, 865,000 people attended the 12-day event, second only to 1995, when 882,000 went. Those numbers represented sharp increases from the 1960's and 1970's, when attendance was usually about 500,000.
This year, the fair, which began on Thursday and ends on Monday, is on a pace to draw an all-time high of more than 900,000, state fair officials said. The fair is held every year at the permanent fairgrounds in Syracuse.
The officials estimated that less than 5 percent of today's fairgoers actually make their livelihoods from agriculture or livestock and said that New York's fair, like scores of others across the country, has evolved to reflect that.
It has become a dizzying, all-purpose entertainment extravaganza, replete this year with hard rock concerts, helicopter rides and the tedious but awe-inspiring construction of what is intended to be world's largest sand castle, which should top out at about 35 feet and more than 400 tons by the time the fair closes.
It's a kitsch-a-palooza, where people can drop by the Pan African Village to purchase lilliputian African figurines that function as refrigerator magnets, then amble over to the Center of Progress for Hawaiian-style leis of flowers they select themselves.
And it's a helter-skelter smorgasbord of such dubiously nutritious concoctions as snow cones, cotton candy, saltwater taffy and, of course, golden, greasy funnel cakes. Fried dough is to state fairs as chocolate is to Valentine's Day.
"The state fair is an orgy of consumption," said Mark Ritson, a marketing professor at the University of Minnesota who is studying state fairs. As such, Mr. Ritson said, it captures the world around it as well as it ever did.
Americans once defined themselves by what they produced, and the state fair's parade of newfangled tractors, plump tomatoes and fleecy sheep paid tribute to that. Americans now define themselves by what they purchase and consume, and the state fair exalts and indulges their ravenous, sometimes indiscriminate appetites.
State fairs began in the early 19th century as American adaptations of European harvest festivals, which reveled in the bounty of the land. They were vital to the agrarian economy, serving as trade shows for farmers who needed to familiarize themselves with the changing tools and methods of production or advertise their goods to potential customers.
But as the country industrialized and the number of small farms and farmers dwindled, state fairs were threatened with irrelevance. By the late 1980's, many state legislatures were cutting off tax money for the events and insisting that fairs become economically self-sufficient.
Joe LaGuardia, the marketing director for the New York State Fair, said it stopped receiving public money for anything but major construction work in 1990. While the fair is still its own quasi agency within the State Department of Agriculture and Markets, it now supports itself, in part through aggressive courtship of corporate sponsors. Every other pavilion or event at the fair seems to wear the tag of a company or brand name, from Coca-Cola to Pizza Hut, Mikasa to Motorola.
Fair officials have also devised ways to sell its most traditional elements to a modern audience by framing the fair as a sort of living museum, a child-friendly educational bridge to a simpler era.
The buildings devoted to cows and dairy products include not only the animals themselves, but also a painted wooden effigy at which children can mimic the task of milking, and a refrigerated sculpture of a milk deliveryman made with 1,000 pounds of butter.
There are tours of working barns that leave regularly from the fairgrounds. Matt and Linda Clark and their three sons had just returned from one when they sat down for a brief rest in the goat and swine building on Friday night.
"Most kids don't realize where everything comes from, and we learned that 98 percent of a beef cow is used for different things, not just for food," said Mr. Clark, a nuclear engineer from Parish, N.Y.
His wife nodded her agreement. "A lot of people from New York City don't know anything about this stuff," she said with more than a touch of rural pride. "They only know about the restaurants where the beef ends up."
Nostalgia draws many people to the fair. Carol Koller of Rockville Center, N.Y., came for a second year in a row and dwelled upon a jar of award-winning pickled vegetables in the Art and Home Center on Saturday morning.
"This is the way our grandparents lived," she said. "Who has the time today? Everybody runs around."
But the march of progress was evident even in the culinary judging booth just feet away, where a panel of four women size up the fruitiest pies, fluffiest cakes and fudgiest brownies.
"We have more and more low-sugar categories," said Candy Crider, a home economics teacher on the panel. "Grilled vegetables are new this year."
"That's very trendy," chimed in another judge, Carol Bradford.
The judges were in a delicate mood, for it was jam and jelly day, not among their favorites.
"It's so sweet and unrelenting," said Ms. Bradford, who received a nutrition degree from Cornell University and studied at the Cordon Bleu in Paris, as she steered her plastic spoon toward a paper plate with several gelatinous smears.
Some of the jam entries had to be eliminated at the outset. "One of the rules is that we won't eat anything that has a foreign object in it, like hair or debris from the kitchen," Ms. Bradford said.
"Those are the ones we can identify," said Ms. Crider, who clucked appreciatively over a blueberry-spearmint entry in the "herb jelly or jam" category and a cranberry-jalapeno melange in the "favorite jelly" field.
Still to come was Spam day, rewarding the contestant who uses the processed luncheon meat in the most ingeniously delectable fashion with a $100 prize from Hormel Foods and the chance to compete in the company's national Spam contest. One year, the contest was won by someone who used Spam in a chocolate cake.
Also ahead was the macaroni and cheese bake-off, which Sharon Potucek of Skaneateles, N.Y., a regular fairgoer who was hovering near the judging area on Saturday morning, said she was hoping to win. "You can do a lot with macaroni and cheese," said Ms. Potucek, an office manager for a heating fuel company. "And I'm not telling you what I'm doing."
She said that in a new twist for her fair-obsessed family, she and her husband were competing against each other, and not just in one cateogry. Both were submitting macaroni and cheese dishes and fruit pies. "I think we're headed for divorce," Ms. Potucek said.
But for every fairgoer who approaches the event with the utmost seriousness, there are several who revel in its sheer goofiness. Events like the leaping llamas, staged on Friday night to a recording of the Pointer Sisters song "Jump," cater shamelessly to that crowd.
"What you have to do is pick out your favorite llama and cheer 'em on to victory," explained Valerie Podet, a graduate student in geology at the State University of New York at Buffalo. Ms. Podet had a special interest in the outcome; her department chairman, Michael Sheridan, owned one of the llamas in the contest.
One by one, the serene beasts of burden, several of them shorn and groomed to look like gargantuan poodles, were led on leashes toward a horizontal wooden pole. Some simply planted their feet and refused to budge. Some blithely barged into the bar.
Mr. Sheridan's llama did fine at 28 and 30 inches, but failed at 32. By 36 inches, the field of about a dozen llamas had been narrowed to two, and "Jump" was on its third or fourth replay. The winning height was 40 inches, nearly as high as the triumphant llama's back.
There were peals of laughter, hoots of delight and robust applause. Then the 200 spectators scattered into the night. Candied apples, laser tag games, a live shark exhibit and a show by the Wallflowers, part of the Molson Concert Series, awaited them.

HEADLINE: Tax Takes a Holiday for Some Back-to-School Shoppers

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
In a back-to-school gift to shoppers and retailers, the fourth tax-free shopping week in the last two years begins today in New York State, with state sales taxes eliminated on all clothing and shoes costing less than $500.
New York City has suspended its own tax as well, meaning that through next Monday, city shoppers will not have to pay the normal 8.25 percent in sales tax on most types of apparel. The reprieve is intended in part to keep shoppers from taking their business elsewhere, as lower-tax states like New Jersey have often drawn people at peak shopping times like the holidays and before the opening of school. 
 Some retailers are worried, however, that the recent turmoil on Wall Street and other factors may undermine the impact of this week's tax cut.
"During past tax-free shopping weeks, United Colors of Benetton stores citywide saw a dramatic surge in sales," said Carlo Tunioli, general manager of Benetton U.S.A. "However, this tax-free shopping week may be impacted by the recent instability in the financial markets and the unrelenting hot weather, making customers reluctant to shop and thereby affecting a normally profitable sales period."
The 8.25 percent sales tax in New York City is made up of three components: a 4 percent state sales tax, a 4 percent city sales tax, and a 0.25 percent tax levied by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. During the last legislative session, lawmakers approved the gradual elimination of the state's sales tax on certain clothing.
Under the measure, the state share of the sales tax on clothing will be eliminated on clothing and footwear for items under $500 from Jan. 17 to 24, 1999, and will be permanently eliminated for clothing and footwear sold for less than $110 beginning Dec. 1, 1999. .
Ethel Sloan, marketing director of the Manhattan Mall, at Broadway and 33d Street, said that past tax-free weeks have drawn a sharp increase in shoppers. "We are anticipating an extremely strong response," Ms. Sloan said. "The past times we have had the tax-free week, our retailers have reported substantial increased traffic and sales, particularly stores like Modell's, Children's Place and Express."
The accounting and consulting firm KPMG Peat Marwick, which has studied past tax-free weeks, has forecast that retail sales volume in New York City would rise 125 percent during the week, in part because of normal back-to-school shopping. The figure was higher than the increase in sales in 1997, in part because of an improved economy and the inclusion of footware as a tax-free purchase, the firm said.
The firm also noted in its report of January's tax-free week that the tax reprieve prompted additional spending on taxable items while consumers were purchasing clothing, shoes and other items. This week, the items that are still taxable include watches, umbrellas, Rollerblades, sunglasses, handbags and helmets, among other items.
Not all cities in New York State are following the state's lead in suspending taxes for the week. The local 2 percent sales tax in White Plains remains in effect, though shoppers will still get a break on the state taxes.
Elliott Ettenberg, chief executive of Bozell Retail Advertising, said the tax elimination was a great boon to parents shopping for school supplies for their children. "If you do the math, at back-to-school time alone, the city loses $40 per child -- that's the cost of another outfit," he said.
"It's a mistake to have this tax at all," he said. "The city should get its tax money from hotel taxes, from the visitors who are clogging the city, instead of hurting the people who live here."
The tax-free week started symbolically on Sunday when Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani knocked down a stack of milk bottles with "tax" printed on them and then went shopping at Modell's in midtown.
"We have already seen a sharp increase in the sales of both footware and apparel during tax-free shopping week, especially with the New York Yankees merchandise line," said Michael Modell, president of Modell's Sporting Goods.

HEADLINE: Russia on the Verge

 BODY:
Boris Yeltsin's hastily arranged deal with the Communists last weekend was troubling, but Sunday night's sudden collapse of their bargain could prove even worse. Its first negative consequence was yesterday's parliamentary rebuff to Mr. Yeltsin's nominee for prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin. Russia is left without a government at a moment when urgent action is needed to check the country's vertiginous financial free fall. A prolonged vacuum in Moscow could fracture the geographically sprawling Russian Republic.
Such a troubled country would be an uncertain environment for a politically healthy American leader. President Clinton, in his weakened state, runs the risk of appearing ineffective and surrounded by chaos wherever he turns. Yet, having chosen not to postpone his trip, Mr. Clinton will have to address the crisis that will swirl around him in Moscow. He must speak forthrightly to the Russian people and to Russia's riven political leadership. 
 Yesterday's 253-to-94 parliamentary vote against Mr. Chernomyrdin is part of a bargaining process that could still produce agreement between Mr. Yeltsin and the Communist-dominated legislature. The Communist leader, Gennadi Zyuganov, rejected the political truce his subordinates worked out because he feared that once Mr. Chernomyrdin was confirmed, Mr. Yeltsin might renege on his commitment to yield some presidential powers. Mr. Chernomyrdin has two more chances to be confirmed before Mr. Yeltsin can call new parliamentary elections. The Communists presumably will use these votes to bargain for firmer guarantees.
But Russia has no time for such gamesmanship. Confidence in the ruble and the Government's ability to pay its obligations, including salaries, is near zero. Private foreign investors are pulling out. Russia needs infusions of money from Western governments, but they are saying that no new help will be forthcoming until Russia has a stable government with a serious economic program.
The most urgent task facing the next Russian government is not repaying foreign bankers or politically powerful domestic tycoons. It must regain the confidence of Russia's people, many of whom, including soldiers and nuclear scientists, have not been paid in months. Assuaging their anger will require the cooperation of all three elements battling for power in Russia -- Communists, business barons and Western-oriented reformers. All stand to lose if the current disintegration proceeds. They need to coordinate their efforts under the leadership of Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Chernomyrdin to pull Russia back from the precipice.
This is primarily a challenge for Russian politicians. But Mr. Clinton, while there, should take every opportunity to encourage the Russian people and tell Russian leaders that they can no longer look to Western bailouts as a way to avoid fundamental economic challenges at home. If Mr. Clinton cannot command the respect that once was his, he can at least mix reassurance with necessary candor.

INTERNATIONAL A3-12
 
Parliament Rejects Yeltsin's Choice
Russia's Parliament emphatically rejected President Boris N. Yeltsin's choice of Viktor S. Chernomyrdin for Prime Minister after an acrimonious debate, leaving the nation virtually rudderless in the midst of its deepening economic crisis.A1 

Although the vote against the confirmation of Mr. Chernomyrdin came as no surprise -- after the Communist opposition pulled back from a power-sharing agreement that would have salvaged his candidacy -- there was a striking lack of urgency about the debate. A11
 
President Clinton's visit to Moscow for a summit meeting with President Yeltsin was met with indifference by many Russians. A11
 
North Korea Launches Missile
North Korea fired a two-stage ballistic missile that crossed northeastern Japan, which strongly protested the action. The test added to the apprehension about security in the region by suggesting that North Korea had increased the range of its missiles.
 A6
 
North Korea's test of a medium-range missile capable of reaching targets in Japan and beyond represents a technological breakthrough that has raised new fears about the spread of ballistic missiles, said Administration officials and arms control experts. A6
 
Holocaust Laborers File Suit
Lawyers in the United States and Germany have filed a class-action suit against Germany's biggest industrial companies on behalf of workers forced into slave labor during Hitler's regime. The outcome of the suit could amount to billions of dollars being paid by companies like Daimler-Benz, Volkswagen, BMW and Siemens. A9
 
Latin American Markets Drop
Markets and currencies across Latin America are sinking as panicky investors retreat to the safe haven of American treasury bonds and dollars. But because most of the underlying economies are solid, the international financial crisis might have little effect in Latin America, economists and analysts said. A3
 
Uncertainty for Panama
Panama's presidential politics were thrown into a free-for-all after voters defeated a proposal that would have amended the Constitution to allow President Ernesto Perez Balladares to serve five more years and thereby control the Panama Canal when the United States relinquishes the waterway at the end of next year. A8
 
I.R.A. Denies Link to Bombing
The Irish Republican Army, which has observed a cease-fire for 13 months, made a rare public statement denying any connection to the bombing by an I.R.A. splinter group that killed 28 people in Omagh, Northern Ireland. The I.R.A. also rejected demands that it disarm soon and declare an end to its war against British sovereignty. A12
 
NATIONAL A18-23
 
Gore Dismisses Effect Of Lewinsky on Elections
Vice President Al Gore said he did not agree with Democrats who say they fear that the Lewinsky matter will be a major liability in the elections this year. Mr. Gore, who was traveling in Ohio and Illinois, made his remarks in his first interview since President Clinton's disclosure of an improper relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky. A22
 
No Gas Link to Gulf Illnesses
A Senate committee has concluded that while the Government failed many veterans of the Persian Gulf War there is insufficient evidence to conclude that exposure to Iraqi nerve gas caused any illnesses. A22
 
US West Strike Settlement
U S West tentatively settled a two-week-old strike, putting employees back to work at the nation's sixth-largest Bell company. The settlement must be ratified by the 34,000 striking members of Communications Workers of America. A20
 
Meeting on Northwest Walkout
Transportation Secretary Rodney E. Slater asked officials of Northwest Airlines and its striking pilots union to meet with him in Washington today. President Clinton, who asked Mr. Slater to call the meeting, has the power to order the pilots back to work for a 60-day cooling-off period, but the chief Federal mediator, who is responsible for recommending such action, said she did not think it would be a good idea now. A20
 
Computer Bug Hits Medicare
Government efforts to avoid a problem that threatens to shut down computers on Jan. 1, 2000, could cost Medicare recipients as much as $570 million in savings on their co-payments. A22
 
New Charges for Marine Crew
The Marine Corps said the pilot and the navigator of a plane that struck a ski lift cable in the Italian alps, killing 20 people, were being charged with obstruction of justice because they had hidden or destroyed a videotape, made during the flight. The officers already face court-martial on charges of negligent homicide and involuntary manslaughter. If convicted on all charges, they would face up to life in military prison. A22
 
Public Service Made Mandatory
The Chicago public school system has become the largest district in the nation to require students to perform community service to receive a high school diploma, starting with this year's sophomore class. The students will need to spend at least 40 hours in public service, like tutoring young people or helping the elderly, during high school, and submit an essay, a video project, an oral report on their experience. A18
 
P.T.A. Endorses Supply Chain
The National P.T.A. has agreed to let its name and logo appear, for a fee, in back-to-school advertisements by a large office-supply chain. Critics say the move is at odds with the organization's own policy opposing commercialism in schools. A18

HEADLINE: TURMOIL IN RUSSIA: THE SUMMIT;
Moscow Mood: What if They Ascended a Summit and No One Cared

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Aug. 31

 BODY:
Russia's top network news program, "Vremya," led off tonight with Parliament's rejection of Viktor S. Chernomyrdin as Prime Minister, the ruble's continued wobbliness and the anniversary of Diana's death. Then it flagged fascinating plans by Muslim extremists for several villages in rural Dagestan.
And oh, yes -- the President of the United States arrives Tuesday morning for a summit meeting with the President of Russia, Boris N. Yeltsin. That item was relegated to the second half of the newscast. 
 Such meetings used to be called summits for a reason. One can harken to Reykjavik, where Reagan and Gorbachev nearly disarmed, or Vienna, where Khrushchev took Kennedy to the woodshed, or even Washington, where Mr. Yeltsin ascended to the world stage on the arm of George Bush.
It would hardly be fair to call the latest meeting a nadir. There still are important issues to chew on. But in Russia, at least, it is close to a non-event.
Four newspapers published Monday issues in Moscow (most newspapers take the day off), including two serious journals, Sevodnya and Komsomolskaya Pravda. Not one mentioned the next day's meeting -- not merely on page 1, but anywhere.
"There's no enthusiasm," said Sergei Karaganov, a foreign policy specialist and sometime adviser to Foreign Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov. "It's not an issue for the simple reason that there are more important issues on the agenda. Most people, even in the political class, do not even suspect or remember that there is a meeting."
Indeed, the most spirited comment on the summit meeting came today from Russia's wildest-eyed nationalist, Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, who said people with Russia's high moral standards had no business meeting "with a man who cannot settle his relations with a secretary."
To an extent, Russians can be excused for their indifference. In the judgment of most experts, the country is in its worst political crisis since 1993, when Mr. Yeltsin's tanks shelled Parliament to put down a rebellion, and perhaps since the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991.
The great national issues these days, discussed everywhere, are the number of rubles a dollar will buy and the odds of a civil war or a putsch.
Mr. Clinton's arrival seems trivial in comparison, especially since he has little but moral support to lend Russia's democrats after their calamitous seven-year experiment with capitalism.
Mr. Clinton's three-day visit will cover the usual bases, from international terrorism to the spread of nuclear weapons to disarmament. To average Russians -- indeed, to Russia's Parliament and much of its executive branch -- none of them hold a candle right now to the 40 percent rise in the cost of cooking oil at local markets or their almost complete inability to tap savings accounts at the neighborhood bank.
For Mr. Clinton this visit is also a comedown.
His advisers first held out the meeting as a glittering prize for Russia should it finally ratify the Start 2 nuclear weapons treaty. Unfortunately, the get-togethers are not so prized anymore, and the Communist-controlled Parliament was more than happy to let the treaty languish, even if it kept Mr. Clinton out of town.
And so the President's trip has been recast primarily as an economic pep talk for Mr. Yeltsin and his troops, urging them to stay the agonizing course to free-market prosperity.
"What I want to do is to go there and tell them that the easy thing to do is not the right thing to do," Mr. Clinton said today in Virginia, in an apparent reference to alternatives to capitalism. "The easy thing to do would be to go back to the way they did it before, and it's not possible."
If there is a problem with this message, it is that Russians have heard it several times from virtually every Western leader, and with the ruble's drop of nearly 40 percent this month alone, it may be starting to ring a bit false.
The West may have had the best of intentions, Mr. Karaganov, the policy specialist, said today, but its advice and Mr. Yeltsin's Western-trained advisers "have brought about the total collapse of the economy and effectively bankrupted most of the Russian bourgeoisie in the last few days."
As so the little summit news that is playing in Moscow this week, on talk radio and even in some newspapers, is more often the refrain sung this afternoon by Kazbek Tzikou, a Communist legislator from the depressed southern region of Kuban.
"Yeltsin stands over everyone like a cobra and forces them to do what his friend Bill wants," Mr. Tzikou told the lower house of Parliament today. "Tell Clinton not to come. People would tear him to pieces if they could. Let him go to the moon with his advice and his dollars."
Nothing personal, of course. "Tell the American people that we wish peace and accord with them," Mr. Tzikou added.

HEADLINE: Many Ways Seen to Ease Property Tax

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Aug. 31

 BODY:
The State Property Tax Commission, created by Gov. Christine Todd Whitman after her narrow re-election victory last fall, has agreed on dozens of recommendations intended to lower real estate taxes in New Jersey.
At the Governor's request, the commission did not consider statewide tax increases to offset property tax bills, but panel members said one proposal would give the state's largest cities and towns new taxing authority. 
 Instead of relying on property levies alone, municipalities might be able to raise revenue by taxing parking, payrolls, hotels or even entertainment and sporting events. The recommendation would require approval by the State Legislature, where word of the proposal has already met with some skepticism.
The panel is also expected to recommend placing a cap on the salaries of school, municipal and county employees, a proposal that is guaranteed to draw strong union opposition. Other suggestions include state incentives for local governments to share services and having the state pick up the $200 million cost of New Jersey's 21 county prosecutor offices.
During her hard-fought campaign last year, Governor Whitman vowed to tackle the issue after polls showed that voters did not think she had answered their concerns about paying the highest property taxes in the nation.
The 24-member panel, made up of local and state government officials, as well as business and academic leaders, is expected to outline its recommendations to Governor Whitman early in September. Many of the suggestions would require legislative action, panel members said.
While some panel members said there was no single suggestion that would immediately deliver significant property tax relief, they also said that the recommendations, taken together, could reduce property tax bills over time.
The commission is expected to point out that New Jersey's longstanding tradition of home rule, including the reluctance of communities and school districts to share costs and control, is one of the biggest reasons property tax bills are so high. The report notes the hundreds of layers of local government: 566 municipal governments, 21 county governments, 188 fire districts and 611 school districts.
"There are no easy answers," said Barbara Cannon, the Mayor of Old Bridge Township and chairwoman of the commission. "Nothing is simple. There are going to have to be some choices made here."
One possible solution was off limits, at Mrs. Whitman's request: a statewide tax increase. "We did not want to increase the state's overall tax burden," Ms. Cannon said.
New Jerseyans pay the highest per-capita property taxes in the nation. The average property tax bill for homeowners is $4,000 a year, with public schools taking the largest chunk of that money. The state covers about 40 percent of the cost of local schools; the national average of state assistance to public schools is 50 percent of the total cost.
Although some experts say that significantly increasing state aid, particularly to schools, would be the most direct way to reduce local property taxes, New Jersey voters have already voiced their disapproval of that approach.
Former Gov. Jim Florio was widely criticized for pushing through a state income tax increase in 1990 to bolster state assistance for local schools and provide property tax relief. He lost his re-election campaign three years later to Mrs. Whitman, who promised to roll back the income tax rate increases. She kept her promise in her first term, but critics contend that she helped pay for part of the tax cut by not increasing state aid to municipalities.
In addition to offering specific suggestions, the commission's recommendations are also intended to raise awareness among taxpayers about the cost of various programs and policy decisions, particularly those concerning land use.
The panel is expected to issue a warning to municipalities about the high cost of some new development projects. For years, cities and towns embraced development to expand their property tax bases, but the panel notes that unchecked development can often end up adding to the tax burden of municipalities and school districts.
The panel is also expected to urge municipalities to follow the state's master development plan when making land-use decisions. The plan tries to guide growth away from environmentally sensitive and rural areas to parts of the state with existing roads and sewers that can support new development.
Since many of the commission's recommendations would require action by the State Legislature, some lobbying groups, including the state's largest teachers' union, are already preparing for battle.
Karen Joseph, a spokeswoman for that union, New Jersey Education Association, said the association did not think that the best approach to lowering property taxes was capping public employees' salaries, as the panel suggests. "We would be opposed to such a move," she said.
In the Legislature, it remains uncertain which recommendations are likely to win the backing of state lawmakers.
"There is not a silver-bullet solution to this," said Assemblyman Richard H. Bagger, a Republican from Westfield and chairman of the Assembly Appropriations and Budget Committee.
"It is a combination of a lot of different ideas," Mr. Bagger said. "But I am a dedicated incrementalist. And I am very confident that there will be a series of proposals that the Legislature can act upon and that will have some positive benefits for property taxpayers."
Assemblyman Joseph J. Roberts Jr., a Democrat who has been long involved in state fiscal matters, said he agreed with some of the recommendations that have been made public, particularly those urging local governments and school districts to consolidate some services. "I have tried to keep an open mind until I see a final document," he said.
But Mr. Roberts, whose legislative district includes the troubled city of Camden, said he was concerned about the recommendation that would allow cities and large municipalities to impose new taxes.
"It skirts the issue, which is the over-reliance on property taxes," Mr. Roberts said. "That is what is plaguing a place like Camden. If you have a community that is going to place greater burdens on the people who live there and work there, it is only going to cause businesses and residents to flee."
A few cities -- Newark, Elizabeth, and Jersey City -- already have authorization from the State Legislature to impose some levies beyond property taxes, including payroll and parking taxes. The recommendation would allow those cities to expand their taxing authority and enable other large municipalities to impose new taxes. In some cases municipalities may look to shift the burden from residents to people who work or visit but who do not live there.
Newark's Mayor, Sharpe James, said that he welcomed the recommendation because it would give cities more flexibility and help relieve the tax burden on residential property owners. "There has been a shrinking residential base," Mr. James said. "You are talking about helping those brave souls who have not abandoned the cities."
At the same time, Mr. James said that Newark and other cities had to be careful about not imposing any taxes that would hurt the city's economic development efforts.
State Senator Joseph M. Kyrillos Jr., a Republican from Middletown Township and a member of the Senate budget committee, said that the property tax problem, in some ways, was similar to the automobile insurance problem that lawmakers tackled earlier in the year. After much discussion and debate, the Legislature finally approved a package of bills earlier this year that was intended to lower auto insurance rates.
"There is really no easy answer to this," Mr. Kyrillos said. "With auto insurance, you had to change the product to change the cost. With property taxes, we may not be able to afford all the government that we now have. We are going to have to make some real choices, and hopefully, people will allow us, and encourage us, to make those types of choices."

HEADLINE: Transportation Secretary Calls for Meeting in Pilots' Strike

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS, Aug. 31

 BODY:
At the request of President Clinton, Transportation Secretary Rodney E. Slater asked officials of Northwest Airlines and its striking pilots union today to meet with him in Washington on Tuesday.
Mr. Clinton has the power to order the pilots back to work for a 60-day cooling-off period, but the chief Federal mediator, who is responsible for recommending such action, said she did not think such an order would be a good idea now. 
 Northwest today canceled all its flights for Wednesday and some international flights for Thursday as the strike by its 6,173 pilots went into its third day with no movement by either side.
No negotiations were scheduled, as both sides stuck to their final stances before the walkout.
Mr. Clinton called on both sides to "redouble their efforts to resolve their differences," but said, "it is up to the negotiating parties to reach an agreement."
Northwest said its chief executive, John H. Dasburg, planned to meet with Mr. Slater. A spokesman for the union, the Air Line Pilots Association, said the union's president, J. Randolph Babbitt, would also attend.
The Transportation Department emphasized that the meeting was not a resumption of the negotiations.
"The Secretary has called Babbitt and Dasburg to meet with him to explain why the negotiations are not going on right now when both sides have said they want to talk," said an official who insisted on anonymity.
Mr. Slater, who met today with Erskine B. Bowles, the White House chief of staff, is being careful not to press the two sides too hard to return to the table because Magdalena G. Jacobsen, the Federal mediator who has been supervising the talks, and who briefed him today, believes that further negotiations when neither side is willing to compromise would be counterproductive, and might even prolong a strike.
"What is the point of pulling people together if there is nothing to talk about?" Ms. Jacobsen, who is chairwoman of the National Mediation Board, a Federal agency that oversees labor matters in the airline and rail industries, said in an interview today. A meeting now could relieve some of the pressure on both sides without advancing the negotiations, she said, and it could also anger workers at the airline by raising false hopes of a settlement.
Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, criticized President Clinton today for not intervening, saying that the strike had already caused serious economic damage. The President has the power to order the pilots back to work while an emergency board tries to resolve the strike. Mr. Clinton used that power last year, when pilots walked out at American Airlines.
But Ms. Jacobsen, who is responsible for making the recommendation of intervention to the White House, said she did not think it was a good idea now because the pilots could simply reject the emergency board's proposal and walk out again in two months, on the eve of the Thanksgiving holiday. "What we are interested in is a resolution that translates into a contract," she said.
Northwest said today that as the strike continues it would cancel flights 48 hours in advance. The carrier is still hoping that the White House will order the pilots back to work before the busy Labor Day weekend, -- though the prospect is fading given Ms. Jacobsen's remarks -- and so it does not want to cancel flights too far in advance.
Disruption from the strike, which was anticipated for more than a month before the pilots walked out early Saturday, was lighter than expected over the weekend, but it became more serious as business travelers faced their first day without the airline. "We are facing a much bigger challenge rebooking our passengers," a Northwest spokesman said.
The airline, which is the country's fourth largest carrier, reiterated its negotiating stance in a teleconference with Wall Street analysts today. It said that it was willing to pay its pilots as much as their counterparts at Northwest's three larger competitors -- United Airlines, a unit of the UAL Corporation; American Airlines, a unit of the AMR Corporation, and Delta Air Lines -- but that the pilots' demand for an "industry-leading" contract would cost too much and would compel Northwest to give equally generous increases to five other unions that are negotiating contracts.
Northwest is offering a 9 percent raise over four years, a lump sum of $57 million, the reduction of a two-tier pay scale to three years from five years, and profit sharing.
The pilots say the package will still pay them less than what pilots receive at the other airlines. They want a 15.5 percent pay increase over three years, a lump sum of $86 million, elimination of the two-tier wage structure and greater job security.
The pilots say the difference between the two sides amounts to $70 million a year, but the airline told analysts that it believed the number was closer to $170 million
Northwest also said that it was losing $10 million to $15 million a day as a result of the strike. Kevin C. Murphy, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, estimated that the company lost $250 million in the month leading up to the walkout because passengers fearing a strike booked flights on competing airlines.
Citing these and other factors, Standard & Poor's, the bond rating agency, said today that it would take a closer look at Northwest's credit rating and possibly downgrade it.

HEADLINE: Taking a Political Detour, Unions Shift Into Neutral

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Aug. 31

 BODY:
About this time in election years, the political gears of New York's powerful labor unions begin turning -- grinding out mailings, setting up phone banks, organizing rallies and issuing endorsements. In statewide elections, those blessings are usually bestowed on Democrats.
But in the governor's race this year, the unions have been mostly silent, and many labor leaders say they will remain neutral. Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, spent his first 18 months in office in pitched battles with unions. But over the last two years, he has effectively neutralized the unions. That has not only denied the Democrats one of their most potent allies, but has also given Mr. Pataki a tactical advantage in not having to defend against a well-financed and organized attack from labor. 
 There is still no political love fest between labor and Mr. Pataki. But union leaders have calculated that the Governor is almost certain to win re-election and that going to war with him would be pointless and would harm their future dealings with him.
Labor chiefs have concluded, warily, that Mr. Pataki is someone they can work with. They point out that since 1996, Mr. Pataki has eased up on budget cutting and has signed a handful of labor-friendly bills.
"This Governor has a lot of drawbacks, but he's trying, and we're trying to work with him," said Danny Donohue, president of the Civil Service Employees Association of New York, which represents 265,000 state and local government workers.
But underlying such judgments is the calculation that a popular governor is too powerful an enemy to make.
"That's certainly a consideration and I'm not going to deny that," said Roger E. Benson, president of the 53,000-member New York State Public Employees Federation, a union of white-collar state workers that does not plan to make an endorsement in the race. "We have to maintain a relationship with the Governor. We're not interested in being at war."
Alan Lubin, executive vice president of the 400,000-member New York State United Teachers, said: "Some unions endorse an incumbent, or stay out of it, because they know he's going to win. Why waste your money when you can have more of an impact in close races that you can make a difference in?"
Zenia Mucha, Mr. Pataki's campaign manager, argued that labor leaders view the Governor more favorably because "they've decided that the Governor's policies are working for their members."
"The basic factor is that more of their members are working," she said. "The Governor's been able to improve the economy, where union members are now employed."
Many union officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, say they prefer Peter F. Vallone, a Democrat, to Mr. Pataki, but do not think he can win. Mr. Vallone, the New York City Council speaker, is a leading candidate for the Democratic nomination for governor.
A handful of unions, including the Buffalo Teachers Federation, are in the Vallone camp. But leaders of many of the state's largest and most politically active unions say their groups will probably not make an endorsement in the governor's race. Mr. Donohue said his group might actually endorse the Governor. The state A.F.L.-C.I.O., representing 2.5 million union members, is likely to remain neutral in the governor's race, according to several of its board members.
District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the umbrella organization for 120,000 New York City employees, is working for Mr. Vallone in the Democratic primary, but Stanley Hill, the council's president, said he was unsure whether it would play a role in the general election.
Kevin McCabe, Mr. Vallone's campaign manager, contended that the unions' neutrality is actually a sign of the Governor's weakness.
"If you're this powerful incumbent and things are going so well, why isn't labor out there endorsing him?" he asked. "By definition, some of the public employee unions aren't going to go with us because they've got to work with the other guy to negotiate a contract. But they can't go to their members with Pataki's record and convince people that he's the right person."
Of course, Mr. Pataki is not the first politician whose power and popularity have discouraged potential antagonists from taking sides. Business groups that disliked Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, a Democrat, were loath to take him on at the height of his popularity.
Mr. Pataki's one-time mentor, United States Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, has proved to be an expert at co-opting his opponents. But Mr. D'Amato, who has less direct power than the Governor to influence the issues labor cares most about, has not managed to silence unions the way Mr. Pataki has.
"Right now, I'd probably guess we're going to come out against D'Amato, go with whoever wins the Democratic primary" in the Senate race, said Ed Cleary, president of the state A.F.L.-C.I.O.
Another Republican, New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who never had the fierce fights with unions that Mr. Pataki did, was endorsed by District Council 37 when he ran for re-election last year, while the United Federation of Teachers was neutral.
Lately, the Governor's relations with unions have seemed downright cozy. He was invited to speak earlier this month at the annual state A.F.L.-C.I.O. convention, where he gave as rousing a pro-labor speech as any old-time liberal, declaring, "I value what you do."
The Governor has also been invited to march in the front row of this year's Labor Day parade in Manhattan, a first for him.
In 1995, his first year in office, Mr. Pataki did battle with unions over his proposals for deep cuts in state spending. He eventually won enough trims to force the elimination of 20,000 jobs. He came under a harsh union attack, including a television ad campaign, that hurt his popularity in polls.
In 1996, there was a new round of budget cutting and clashes, and the Governor set out to outlaw a class of lawsuits stemming from workers' compensation cases, again running into stiff opposition from labor before a compromise was reached.
Later that year, Mr. Pataki reached out to labor as he sought support for his $1.75 billion environmental bond act. Unions enthusiastically supported the measure, the first real thaw in their relationship with the Governor.
Since then, with the state running record surpluses, Mr. Pataki has allowed spending to grow rather than proposing the kind of cuts that threaten union members' jobs and wages. He has also expanded programs dear to the unions, including state-funded day care and health care for poor children.
This year, the Governor signed into law an increase in unemployment benefits for all workers and an increase in pensions for retired state employees, measures that had been avidly sought by labor.
He also vetoed $800 million in spending approved by the Legislature, much of it for programs unions had fought for, including supplementing teacher salaries, building housing for the mentally retarded and accelerating the expansion of day care for low-income families. Still, the budget increased more than 8 percent this year over last, with enough money to keep nearly everyone content. Democrats' efforts to stir up anger over the vetoes failed to get much of a response, or much assistance from the unions.
Some union leaders, speaking on the condition of anonymity, express fear that Mr. Pataki's conversion to moderation is one of convenience, meant to win him re-election and perhaps endear him to labor if he runs for president in 2000. Others say they think that in an economic slowdown, the Governor would return to his old budget-cutting ways.
"We think the Governor's trying to move more toward the center," said Mr. Donohue, president of the civil service union. "All the political pundits can argue about why, but we're hoping it's a permanent move."

HEADLINE: Queens Rivals to Meet Again in Primary for Assembly

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
When Pauline R. Cummings was selected by Queens Democratic Party leaders as their candidate in a special election for an Assembly seat five months ago, she was backed by the party's elected officials in that borough.
Despite that support, her victory in the race -- to fill the Assembly seat vacated when Gregory W. Meeks was elected to Congress -- was a surprisingly slender one. Only 211 votes separated her from her closest rival in a four-person race. 
 Now, in an eagerly watched contest in the Democratic primary, Ms. Cummings is running against the man who came close to snatching that victory.
In part, the primary will be a test of the might of the Queens Democratic organization that has officially embraced her. But it is also being watched because it has the potential of illustrating the continued vitality of the black church in the local political process.
Ms. Cummings's opponent is the Rev. Evan D. Gray, a 29-year-old Baptist minister who is the pastor of a church in Far Rockaway. Mr. Gray showed his electoral strength in the special election not only by drawing nearly as many votes as Ms. Cummings, but also by doing so as a candidate on the Liberal Party line in the overwhelmingly Democratic 31st Assembly District, which includes the neighborhoods of South Ozone Park, Richmond Hill, Springfield Gardens and, across Jamaica Bay, Far Rockaway, which accounts for the bulk of the district's voters.
Once again, Ms. Cummings, 53, has the support of the Queens Democratic organization and its chairman, Representative Thomas J. Manton, as well as the City Comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, and her predecessor in the Assembly, Mr. Meeks.
But Mr. Gray is not without support himself. He is the pastor of the Macedonia Baptist Church, which has a congregation of more than 500, an overwhelming number of whom live within the Assembly district. He has also been endorsed by the Rev. Al Sharpton and one or two union locals. Moreover, Mr. Gray has been the beneficiary of support, all given surreptitiously, from a few Queens politicians who do not want their assistance to become public.
Although both candidates have had several years of involvement in civic and community organizations in the Far Rockaway section of the 31st Assembly District, they are both new to politics.
A bookkeeper in the Manhattan garment district for nearly 30 years, Ms. Cummings has also been the chairwoman of the economic development committee of her local community board. Her principal political benefactor is City Councilwoman Juanita E. Watkins, who approachedMs. Cummings about running for the Assembly seat.
When asked to discuss the issues she considered most important, Ms. Cummings cited education and economic development. Her goal, she said, is to meet with city and state education officials "to see how we can best elevate the level of schooling."
Her five months in Albany, Ms. Cummings said, have been active ones in which she was a co-sponsor of two bills. "I spend a lot of my time talking with my constituents," she said. "I listen to their needs, so that when I get back to Albany, I will know what they want me to do."
Mr. Gray started a civic association in the Arverne section of the Rockaway peninsula and is on the board of a local hospital. Through his church, Mr. Gray has developed a number of programs, some for young people and others for low-income residents.
If Ms. Cummings speaks of the district's needs in broad brush strokes, Mr. Gray examines them with an eye toward details. Driving through the district in his black Grand Marquis on a recent morning, Mr. Gray pointed to everything, from the need to repair a bulkhead along a section of Jamaica Bay to controlling the mosquito population to installing drainage systems in some streets in the district.
It is not that Ms. Cummings is ineffective, he suggests, but merely that he would be more diligent.
"To be honest, I don't have anything negative to say about her," Mr. Gray said. "I just think I'm better for the job because I am a community leader."
His major campaign theme has been the need for jobs in a district where the unemployment level is higher than the city's average.
"I want to sit down with major corporations and entice them to do business in the 31st Assembly District," Mr. Gray said. "We have a lot of vacant land for companies to use for their businesses."
Mr. Gray uses as his model the campaigns of the Rev. Floyd H. Flake, whose resignation from Congress last year opened the way for Mr. Meeks's campaign for the Congressional seat. "We don't have the support of the Democratic organization," he said, "but we'll have the support of the people of the district."
Mr. Gray's predictions have not been widely shared by Queens Democratic politicians, who say that the party's support, coupled with the active involvement of several large unions, will make Ms. Cummings the more formidable candidate.
"He's popular and he's been active and he's a lifelong resident of the peninsula," said Mr. Meeks, who represented the district in the Assembly for five years and is endorsing Ms. Cummings. "He's not someone to be sneezed at.
"For that reason," he added, "Pauline must work hard. But she has shown in a short time that she does have the people's concerns at heart. That needs to be rewarded with her re-election. In the meantime, it will be an active campaign in this district."

HEADLINE: Union Pacific to Limit Traffic on Its Tracks

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

DATELINE: DALLAS, Aug. 31

 BODY:
The Union Pacific Corporation, still recovering from some of the worst congestion in the industry's history, announced a plan today to improve and, in some cases, ration its service.
Even as the railroad makes extensive investments for expansion, executives acknowledged that the company would not be able to reliably, or profitably, accommodate all that want to use its tracks. 
 Richard K. Davidson, the railroad's chairman, stressed his primary goal was to recover the 10 percent of its traffic lost in the last year -- not chase customers away.
"Rationing the business really isn't the main underpinning of what we're getting at here," he said in an interview. "It's how can we best satisfy our customers and maximize the potential for revenue growth."
But Union Pacific is beginning to study what sorts of traffic might be dispensable, or whether to charge more for shipments through crowded corridors at peak seasons, just as airlines would charge the most for a last-minute seat before Christmas.
The railroad plans to organize a new department to make sure its eager marketers do not sign up business and make commitments train operators cannot reliably fulfill.
"It's a more educated approach than we've ever taken before," Mr. Davidson said. "In the old days, when the marketing guys brought business in, whichever wheel squeaked the loudest would get attention."
The tie-ups were chiefly a result of Union Pacific's difficulties in absorbing the Southern Pacific Transportation Corporation, which it bought for $5.4 billion in 1996 to form the nation's largest railroad.
Having then tried to centralize its vast system at an Omaha command center, the railroad recently reversed itself and began farming some operations back out to the regions, appointing three regional vice presidents.
As Union Pacific heads into its own busiest season, with fall grain harvests and Christmas merchandise shipments, the congestion is only gradually easing. Improvements in Texas and elsewhere have raised average speeds throughout the 36,000-mile system to 15 miles an hour, from less than 12 in December, the company reported today.
But continued delays with shipments of chemicals, lumber, agricultural feed and other products in California are keeping speeds below the railroad's 18- or 19-mile-an-hour standard.
 After decades of cutbacks in the industry, Union Pacific is bent on expanding along with the economy as the amount of cargo grows. The company is adding about 550 locomotives over two years to a fleet now at 7,200, and building additional tracks through crowded corridors in states like Nebraska. It has agreed to buy back a track in Kansas it sold and maintain a mountainous route in Colorado it was planning to abandon.
But, as railroad executives like to say, you cannot build the church for Easter. "We've certainly learned the hard way that the days of seemingly unlimited capacity are behind us, and before we sign a contract we'd better be careful," said John Bromley, a company spokesman. "That's a sea change in our thinking. We can't be all things to all people."
Ed Rastatter, a policy director for the National Industrial Transportation League, said some well-planned rationing might be preferable to the unplanned rationing that resulted from the railroad's congestion. Noting he had not seen the Union Pacific announcement, he expressed doubts about whether all customers would benefit.
"This seems like a way of leaving out the little guy to make sure the big guy gets better service," he said. Mr. Davidson, however, said his railroad planned to carry additional smaller shipments as well, adding that chemical companies would continue to be major elements of his company's business.
Randy Speight, the Chemical Manufacturers Association distribution manager, said Union Pacific had already unsnarled its traffic around Houston, an industry hub.
But with tie-ups elsewhere on the rail system, he said, "It's like squeezing a water balloon. The danger is that it's going to flood back to the original problem area."
The Surface Transportation Board, criticized by many shippers for approving the Southern Pacific acquisition, lifted an emergency order in July that had required Union Pacific to share its Texas tracks with competitors.
A board spokesman said today that nobody there would have a comment on the company's latest plans.

HEADLINE: THE MARKET TURMOIL: WALL STREET;
Losses Pile Up On Wall Street As Markets Keep Eroding

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
Wall Street is starting to count the cost of the recent turmoil in financial markets.
Salomon Smith Barney, one of the country's biggest investment banks, said yesterday that in the last two months alone, it lost an estimated $360 million after taxes, in its arbitrage and Russian-related credits businesses. After allowing for profits from its private client and funds management business, Salomon said that it expected its overall after-tax loss for the last two months to be about $150 million. 
 Such losses may spell the end of a long run of bountiful profits for Wall Street, a time when stocks, financial markets and the fortunes of financiers have risen steadily. Another Wall Street firm, Credit Suisse First Boston, said last week that its first- half profits would be down $250 million because of losses on its Russian and Russian-related businesses.
Wall Street is having to adjust to the possibility of a sea change in the financial markets. The recent gloom over the markets has already spread to such areas as advising on big mergers and acquisitions and initial public offerings.
And there already is speculation -- denied by the principals yesterday -- that such high-profile planned transactions as Citibank's $70 billion merger with Travelers Group Inc. -- the parent company of Salomon Smith Barney -- may be postponed. Page 8.
Arda Nazarian, a spokeswoman for Salomon, the investment bank subsidiary of Travelers, said the merger, which would create a company called Citigroup, was on track. Richard J. Howe, a Citicorp spokesman, said: "We remain confident that the Fed will grant to Citigroup bank holding company status in the third quarter. But only the Fed knows the exact timing."
Many on Wall Street also expect Goldman, Sachs & Company to postpone its planned multibillion-dollar sale of a slice of its shares. A spokesman for the firm said yesterday that it would not comment on such rumors, and that Goldman's plans remained unchanged.
Still, if the financial markets continue to deteriorate, there may be more profound changes on Wall Street. Firms could start considering cutting back on expenses, and jobs in particular. Wall Street typically takes such measures when it falls on leaner times, as it did after the October 1987 stock market crash, during the bear market of 1990 and after the bond market rout of 1994.
If there are similar rounds of sweeping job cuts, that, in turn, would have a significant effect on the New York City economy, which has come to rely heavily on its brokerage firms, banks and insurance companies for tax revenues and well-paid jobs.
In a statement about its recent losses in arbitrage and Russian-related credits, Salomon said yesterday that they resulted from the recent "extreme volatility in the global fixed-income and equity capital markets." The brokerage firm estimated that for July and August it would have $60 million of Russian-related credit losses, $120 million of losses on its United States bond arbitrage portfolio and $180 million of losses on its international arbitrage business.
Profits from more successful areas, such as the firm's private client and fund management businesses, have so far helped to offset losses from arbitrage and Russia-related credits. Such profits must have totaled as much as $210 million in the last two months to cut the overall loss in the period to $150 million.
For the moment, several of Salomon's big competitors are keeping mum. "As a matter of policy we do not comment intra-quarter on results," said Tim Gillis, a spokesman for Merrill Lynch & Company. Jon Diat, a spokesman for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said his firm would have no comment on its results for July and August, or on what effect recent falling financial markets may have had on its performance.
In an interview yesterday afternoon, Jamie Dimon and Deryck C. Maughan, the co-chairmen of Salomon Smith Barney, were guarded about measures they may take to try to improve profitablity, and would not say whether their firm plans to cut back its staff, always one of the biggest expenses on Wall Street. "The answer is you don't cut people because of losses," Mr. Dimon said. "We have been probably reducing risk around the company for a while. You pray for the best and you plan for the worst. You have to know your risks and exposures."
Mr. Dimon was also quick to stress that "the rest of Travelers is doing great," and that Salomon's business with Main Street Americans had "not seen a dramatic decrease in retail volume."
But both Mr. Maughan and Mr. Dimon sounded cautious. "You'd be foolish not to worry," Mr. Dimon said. "Beware the Ides of August," Mr. Maughan said, adding that the month of August, in recent years, had ceased to follow financial folklore and be a quiet month for the markets. Mr. Dimon should know; he cut short his family vacation in the eastern Mediterranean to return to New York to discuss the recent losses.

HEADLINE: THE MARKET TURMOIL: MARKET PLACE;
Rumors of the Death of Bears Were, It Seems, Exaggerated

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
As they surveyed their outsized stock market gains over the last three years, some investors may have thought to wonder, on occasion and in an idle sort of way, just what a bear market felt like.
Now they know. 
In another day of relentless selling that took the Dow Jones industrial average down 6.37 percent, stocks of all kinds disintegrated. As a demise, it was orderly. But it was also indiscriminate. "Today was really different," said Douglas Cliggott, United States equity strategist at J. P. Morgan in New York. "Very high-quality companies with no visible sign of earnings weakness were taken down brutally." Indeed, the selling hammered stocks both in and out of favor with investors.
Yesterday was different in another way, however. It marked the first time in years that the three most popular market indexes -- the Dow Jones, the Standard & Poor's 500 and the Nasdaq Composite -- actually lost ground for the year. Until now, the declines in the indexes, unpleasant though they were, had still left investors ahead of the game.
No longer. Investors, playing with the house's money all year, are now faced with the prospect of giving up some of their own. Even those who own index funds, which had registered gains until yesterday, are now eating into last year's gains.
There was no stopping the selling. No "circuit breakers" to stop trading on the New York Stock Exchange to give investors time to regain their reason before they resumed the furious unloading of shares. Under the new rules instituted by the exchange last October, it would take a fall of 900 points for trading to be halted.
No one expects a decline of that magnitude to happen. Indeed, many strategists anticipate a rebound in stocks today. Investors who had been moving their money into cash or money market funds could easily decide that stocks at these levels looked attractive.
Still, yesterday's action was a harrowing reminder to investors of how the law of gravity works in the stock market: shares of the same high fliers that had propelled the market to its triumphant heights led the decline. Dell Computer closed down 15.8 percent, Yahoo ended the day 16.9 percent lower, America Online lost 14.8 percent of its value. Those are breathtaking moves, one-day declines that might have taken months in less frothy markets.
What fueled the decline? Yesterday's economic news wasn't great, but it wasn't awful either. A report from the National Association of Purchasing Management showed that increasing numbers of domestic manufacturers said their business was deteriorating. And sales of new homes fell 1.6 percent in July, a signal that the housing market may be slowing. Both reports contributed to the view that the United States economy was weakening.
Of course, inasmuch as a weaker economy translates to diminished earnings, these figures were not welcome news to stock market investors. Still, they were not the triggers necessary for the all-out collapse seen yesterday.
What appeared to be happening yesterday was the unwinding of two significant patterns of investor behavior. One was the shift from investors' being able to shrug off all bad news, what Wall Street calls climbing the wall of worry, to a newer concern. Maybe the economic problems in Asia, Russia and Latin America combined with the strong dollar will indeed have a deleterious effect on already weakening earnings of American companies.
"What we're looking at here is a rolling realization that there are a lot of problems in the world," said Alan Kral, portfolio manager at Trevor, Stewart, Burton & Jacobsen, an investment management firm in New York. "The sum total of a number of small problems has become a major problem for us. You can't take away growth opportunities in half the world's economies and blithely conclude that American stocks at 25 times earnings are cheap."
But an even greater contributor to yesterday's carnage, strategists say, was the reverse effect of what has come to be known as momentum investing. This strategy, characterized by investors chasing stocks simply because they are rising in price, with little regard for sensible valuations, pushed shares of the favored companies to levels unseen even in the hottest of markets. Now that these stocks are no longer rising, to stay true to their discipline, these investors must sell. And this selling feeds on itself.
"When you're buying something at a very high price-earnings ratio, you've always got your finger on the trigger," said Peter Tanous, investment consultant at Lynx Asset Management in Washington.
In choosing to pull that trigger yesterday, investors seemed to see several things on the horizon they did not like. First were the whiffs of third-quarter earnings disappointments, anecdotal only at this point, but a worry nonetheless. Companies have learned to warn investors when prospects look grim; the warning period for the third quarter begins in two weeks.
Neither have lower interest rates helped the market. This is a turnabout for investors who have come to expect that when rates fall, stock prices rise.
An increasingly bearish sentiment among investment newsletter writers may have contributed to yesterday's selling. According to Mark Hulbert, editor of the Hulbert Financial Digest in Alexandria, Va., at the end of July newsletter writers recommended on average that their readers maintain an exposure in stocks of 63 percent of their portfolio. Yesterday that recommended level had dropped to around 20 percent.
Still, Mr. Hulbert said he was not yet seeing people really throwing in the towel. "Even though there has been a big drop, I thought we'd have seen even more," he said.
The stock market has been largely a confidence game of late, said Fred Hickey, editor of High Tech Strategist. "Since investors have been so certain about their stocks for so long there's a shock factor. People have leveraged themselves, taken risks they shouldn't have taken because these stocks seem so invincible. You're seeing a reversal of these excesses."

HEADLINE: THE MARKET TURMOIL: WHITE HOUSE;
Market Is No Longer Staunch Clinton Ally

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 31

 BODY:
He had good reasons to go to Russia, President Clinton told a friendly audience in an elementary school gymnasium in Virginia shortly before noon today. "We have learned the hard way," he said, "that problems that develop beyond our borders sooner or later find their way to our doorstep."
Sooner, it turned out. 
 Less than three hours after he left the gymnasium, while in Air Force One high over the Atlantic, the President received word from the White House that his staunch political ally, the stock market, had gone south.
"We are living in a smaller and smaller world," Mr. Clinton had said in Virginia, sounding a cherished theme about the economy that might apply as well to how the political walls seem suddenly to be closing in on him.
Later, after hearing of the market's drop, Mr. Clinton spoke by telephone with the Treasury Secretary, Robert E. Rubin. It has long been an inside joke at the White House that the famously overstating President has been forbidden by his understated Treasury Secretary to boast about the astonishing performance of the stock market in recent years. Still, every now and then -- as he did in meeting with workers in Palo Alto, Calif., on May 1 -- he has let slip the observation that "the stock market has gone from 3,200 to 9,000 since I've been President and there's no precedent for that in history."
Today in Virginia, as he usually does, Mr. Clinton confined himself to boasting about other economic indicators. "We've benefited a lot from this global society of ours," he said. "We have over 16 million new jobs in the last six years, and we're about to have our first balanced budget surplus in 29 years."
With Mr. Clinton and many of his senior economic advisers up in the air, it fell to Mr. Rubin today to provide the Administration's calm reaction to the steep drop, after consulting with the President. "The world is currently working its way through a difficult period," he said.
Mark Mellman, a Democratic poll taker, said there might be no direct connection between stock market conditions and Presidential popularity. "Historically, there is very little relationship between stock market gyrations on the one hand and people's evaluations of the economy on the other," he said.
But Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster, said, "The weakness of the stock market will soon be tied into attitudes toward him." Mr. Luntz said that in a survey he conducted last week, 54 percent of likely voters this November said that they owned stocks or mutual funds of some kind. He said the poll had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.
Charles Cook, an independent political analyst who is a particularly close observer of Congress, said he could not predict what effect the drop in the market would have. But he said that combined with the possibility of more damaging information emerging from the inquiry into Mr. Clinton's relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky, the stock market performance did not bode well for the President.
"I was absolutely certain a week ago that Clinton was going to survive this thing, and that the impact on the elections wasn't going to be that great," he said. "And now I'm like totally shaken."

HEADLINE: THE MARKET TURMOIL: DEJA VU -- The Shadow of Black Monday;
Wall St. Has Come a Long Way Since '87, Hasn't It?

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
In the stock market, the sky is falling -- again.
Share prices are plunging, gurus are opining, and rattled investors are biting their nails. Just as they did after similar Mondays in October 1997, July 1996 and, yes, October 1987, the day that Wall Street still calls Black Monday. 
When the bottom finally fell out of the stock market on Oct. 19, 1987, more than one-fifth of the market's value was wiped out in a single day. This year, by contrast, most of the major market indexes -- including the Dow Jones industrial average of 30 blue-chip stocks -- have not yet lost that much from their peaks in July.
Nonetheless, investors can only hope that this Monday is another case of deja vu -- because that would mean the worst is over. After all of those historic blue Mondays, the stock market recovered, in some cases very quickly. In 1996 and 1997, stocks regained their previous peaks within a matter of months.
It took almost two years for investors to recover their losses from the crash of 1987, but recover they did -- and then some. Hard as it may be to remember, back then the Dow Jones industrial average fell to 1,739; even after yesterday's carnage, the Dow still stood at 7,539 -- a 333 percent gain from the bottom nearly 11 years ago.
O.K., that is over more than a decade, far longer than a lot of Americans have been investing. At the end of 1986, for example, fewer than 30 million shareholders had mutual-fund accounts; today, there are more than 135 million such accounts, according to the fund industry's trade group, the Investment Company Institute.
But to some old hands on Wall Street, some of the similarities between the stock market of today and that of 11 years ago are striking. "I was just saying, last Saturday, that it's starting to look like 1987," said Steven C. Leuthold, a money manager and market watcher in Minneapolis.
For those who missed the ugliness at the end of the 1980's, here are some of the similarities -- and the differences -- between those days and today.
SIZE -- Yesterday's decline, though bigger than 1987's one-day drop in points on the Dow, pales on a percentage basis. The 508-point drop in 1987 was a sickening 22.6 percent plunge; this 513-point fall amounts to only 6.4 percent.
SPEED -- Though many investors remember only the awful excitement of that October Monday in 1987, the market had started to fall apart long before it took the final plunge. It peaked in August and took two months to fall 36 percent.
This year, the market peaked in July and has taken six weeks to fall 19 percent.
BREADTH -- This is Wall Street jargon for how strong the market is, based on the number of stocks rising versus the number falling. When breadth is good, the generals and the troops are all marching in the same direction, said James B. Stack of Investech, a newsletter and research firm in Whitefish, Mont. When breadth is bad, the generals are still marching forward, but the troops are in retreat.
In the recent past, as in 1987, breadth has been lousy, Mr. Stack said. While blue-chip stocks continued to make gains, smaller stocks have been tumbling for months.
VALUATION -- This is an effort to compare stock prices to the underlying values of the companies they represent. And by these measures, stocks in 1998 are far more "overvalued" than they were even in 1987, Mr. Leuthold said. In 1987, he said, stock dividends, on average, paid a modest 2.8 percent, and shares were trading at 2.6 times the value of companies' net assets (or book value) and 16.8 times their operating earnings. Today, the dividend yield is a meager 1.8 percent for the Dow stocks, which are trading at 3.4 times book value and 18.3 times operating earnings.
VILLAINS -- Many commentators in 1987 attributed the market crash to program trading and portfolio insurance, which was supposed to protect its users from losses by prompting them to sell shares at the first sign of weakness. Unfortunately, such selling may have exacerbated the declines already under way, which prompted more selling, which worsened the fall, and on and on.
Portfolio insurance has pretty much gone out of fashion, although it may have been replaced by derivatives, which are complex financial contracts that allow buyers and sellers to bet on all kinds of things, including things that no one understands or can predict. Some of the decline yesterday, though, was carried out by computer programs that generate large and rapid sell orders.
GLOBAL TENSIONS -- In 1987, Russia was still the Evil Empire (a.k.a. the Soviet Union). It did not have a stock market, much less a market that could roil America's. Whether Russia's economic problems are really the cause of the current market malaise or just a convenient scapegoat remains unclear. Nor were the smaller so-called emerging markets in Asia and elsewhere a key factor in the 1987 decline.
Germany was seen as the culprit the last time, as Washington and Bonn clashed over the direction of interest rates and economic policies. Angry words from Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d about Germany's decision to raise interest rates were cited at the time as one cause of the market meltdown in the United States.
INTEREST RATES -- The bond market is almost as different as it could be from the way it was in 1987. Then, interest rates were soaring; the yield on long-term Treasury bonds topped 10 percent at the time of the crash. Today, yields on the same bonds have fallen to less than 5.25 percent, the lowest level since the 1970's.
MUTUAL FUNDS -- In 1987, a large fund complex -- commonly believed to be Fidelity Investments -- contributed to the carnage by dumping huge blocks of shares, according to a report by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Heavy selling by mutual funds may also have been at work yesterday. Laszlo Birinyi, who manages money and tracks the market from Greenwich, Conn., said the pattern of trading led him to believe that many funds sold shares shortly before the close of trading, after hoping for most of the day that the market would rebound. Funds try to keep cash on hand to meet redemption requests but must often sell shares to fulfill customers' orders.
SENTIMENT -- The sentiment of those customers may ultimately turn out to be the most important factor in whatever happens in the market today. In 1987, some investors panicked, sold at the lows and regretted it thereafter. Since then, the watchword among amateur investors has been "buy on the dips," no matter how severe. Their staunchness has served as a bulwark in the more recent market meltdowns.
Until now, perhaps. While there are few reports of panic selling, big fund companies like T. Rowe Price and Vanguard confirm that many investors have switched at least some of their holdings from stock funds to bond funds. And chatter -- on the Internet, in offices, and on the omnipresent financial television shows -- suggests that many investors are at least considering a move to the sidelines.
One thing to look for to tell if the party is really over: Street vendors will be selling watches from Timex, not "Rolex." Like a lot of other things related to the stock market, it has been known to happen before.

HEADLINE: THE MARKET TURMOIL: STOCKS;
DOW OFF 6% IN WAVE OF SELLING, ERASING MARKET'S GAINS FOR '98; PRESSURE FOR RATE CUT LIKELY

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
Waves of selling by investors large and small engulfed the stock market yesterday.
The selloff erased the last of the market's gains this year and sent stock prices down more than 19 percent from their peak set just six weeks ago, the sharpest decline in eight years. 
 The frenzied selling dashed the hopes of investors who had expected the market's recent slump -- which began with worries over economic conditions in Asia and accelerated as financial troubles ensnared Russia -- to be stayed by the fundamental strength of the American economy.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 512.61 points, or 6.4 percent, to 7,539.07, leaving the bellwether index 4.7 percent below where it started the year. The decline was the second largest in the Dow's history in point terms, trailing the 554-point drop last Oct. 27, but it did not rank in the top 20 when measured in percentage terms. The Standard & Poor's 500 index, a broader measure of the market, fell more than 69 points, or nearly 7 percent, to 957.28, down 1.3 percent since the beginning of 1998. The declines were the greatest among technology stocks, which until recently had been the market leaders.
The cumulative effect of the last few weeks is nearly as great as the one-day market plunge on Oct. 19, 1987, when stock prices fell 22.6 percent. But a market rebound soon followed and the national economy did not stray into recession.
While there were few signs yesterday of panic among individual investors, market participants said that selling by mutual fund companies, responding to withdrawals by individual investors that began over the weekend, played a part in the decline, including the stampede that sent the Dow average down 250 points in the last half-hour of trading.
The selloff in stocks accompanied a big rally in the bond market, where everyone seemed to be seeking shelter in securities that are backed by the Federal Government. As its price rose with demand, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to a record low of 5.25 percent.
Economists and financial analysts said the market rout was almost certain to put intense pressure on the Federal Reserve to lower short-term interest rates. For more than a week, the rates on some short-term securities have been higher than on some long-term bonds, a situation that is a classic precursor to a recession.
In Washington, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said yesterday that the economy remained sound, although he acknowledged that "the world is currently working its way through a difficult period." Mr. Rubin and Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, who is on vacation in California but who was in touch with Mr. Rubin yesterday, are scheduled to meet in California on Friday with the Finance Minister of Japan, Kiichi Miyazawa.
Whatever the cause of the financial difficulties that have plagued Asia and Russia over the last year, economists say, the stock market's recent activity indicates that those troubles have begun to wash up on America's shores.
"This is the first time in a long time where the future of the American economy hinges so much on what happens to American stock prices," said Henry Kaufman, a New York economist. "Consumers have much more than usual invested in stocks, and it has influenced their spending. That has benefited businesses enormously." With the decline in stock prices, he said, "we could begin to see the reverse."
He suggested that the situation called for a government response. "We are having a global financial problem," he said, "and it is a problem that cannot go away quickly. If there are further declines in the equity market, there should be an orchestrated reduction in interest rates by the major industrial countries." The scope of the market decline and the lurking economic threats seem to have sunk in with individual investors, who have been the stalwart supporters of the bull market for the last few years. Mutual fund companies, including Fidelity Investments, the country's largest fund company, reported withdrawals from stock funds over the weekend and yesterday, with most of those investors moving into money market or bond funds.
Bearing the brunt of yesterday's selloff were many of the technology stocks that have been the most popular with individual investors and with the mutual funds in which they invest. The Nasdaq composite index, the major market index most heavily populated with technology issues, fell 140 points, or 8.6 percent, to 1,499.25 -- its steepest daily decline in points and the fourth steepest in percentage terms. The Nasdaq index is now 4.5 percent below the level at the start of the year.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange measured 914.7 million shares, the third-busiest day on the Big Board, and the number of stocks that declined exceeded those that advanced by a ratio of more than seven to one. Exceptionally heavy volume on the Chicago Board Options Exchange caused a computer problem near the end of trading. But despite that glitch, Mr. Rubin said that the financial markets' mechanisms worked "effectively."
The Dow industrial average has declined nearly 1,799 points, or 19.3 percent, from its record closing price of 9,337.97 on July 17. That is slightly less, in percentage terms, than the 21.2 percent drop in the Dow in the bear market of 1990, which lasted from mid-June through early October.
Most other stock markets around the world posted losses yesterday, partly in response to last week's decline in the American stock market. Germany's leading market index fell 2.3 percent yesterday. British markets were closed for a bank holiday. In Hong Kong, the stock market plummeted, falling more than 7 percent after the government, which intervened to help prop up share prices last week, did not do so yesterday. Virtually alone among the world's major exchanges, Japan's market had a rise of 1.4 percent yesterday, bouncing back from last week's decline that took the Nikkei index to its lowest level in more than a decade.
To some traders and analysts, the decline on Wall Street yesterday took on some of the characteristics of a selling frenzy, the type of relentless liquidation of investors' portfolios that comes only at the point of maximum pessimism.
"The only good thing I see is that they are finally going after the sacred cows, the drugs and the retail stocks and the technology sector," said Henry Herrmann, chief investment officer at Waddell & Reed, a mutual fund company in Overland Park, Kan. Until yesterday, those stocks had proved a sort of refuge from the storm.
"When they are pounding the stocks that wouldn't go down, that tells me that the sentiment is really negative," Mr. Herrmann said. "And when the sentiment gets that negative, you can get a reversal pretty quick."
While Mr. Herrmann suggested a stock bounce might be in order, yesterday's rout, and the round of relentless selling at the end of trading, left open the possibility that further declines will follow today. Relatively few people in the market seem to believe that the downturn is finished.
"It may be that we are reaching a temporary climax," said Richard McCabe, an analyst at Merrill Lynch who tracks technical indicators. But he said that the market was just as likely to stumble further, at least as low as 7,400 on the Dow, which was the lowest point in January and is 2 percent below its current level. Last Oct. 27, on the day that the Dow industrials lost 554 points, the average fell as low as 6,971.
Market analysts and traders said there were several sources of the heavy selling that came at the end of yesterday's session. Laszlo Birinyi, an analyst who tracks program trading, the computer-driven trading strategies often employed by professional trading firms, said that much of the late-day volume appeared to come from institutions that had placed sell orders earlier in the day and needed them completed before trading ended.
Mr. Birinyi concluded that the heavy selling came from mutual fund companies responding to orders placed over the weekend and during the trading day.
There was some concern among traders that heavy selling was coming from index mutual funds, one of the few categories of stock funds that have continued to take in cash during the market's recent decline. But George U. Sauter, a managing director at the Vanguard Group who oversees the company's index funds, said in an interview that Vanguard's two big funds that track the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index did not participate in the market yesterday.
"By and large we've had positive cash flow into the funds, although certainly not to the extent we had earlier in the year," Mr. Sauter said. One of the big Vanguard index funds had a slight outflow but that was balanced out by an inflow into the other, Mr. Sauter said, meaning that the impact on the S.& P. 500 index was canceled out.
Near the end of the day, according to two traders, heavy selling of stock-index futures by hedge funds prompted some institutions to activate what are known as index arbitrage trades. In these cases, the trades involved selling the stocks in the S.& P. 500 index and buying the associated futures, in an attempt to lock in as profit the difference between the futures contract and the higher-priced stocks.
In an environment like yesterday's, few stocks were able to maintain gains; only 27 of the stocks in the S.& P. 500 rose yesterday. Among the gainers were utility companies, a traditional haven in tough times because of their high dividends, and shares of companies that sell food, beverages and other staples that consumers are expected to buy in good times and bad.
Yesterday's stock plunge knocked about $700 billion off the market value of companies in the Wilshire 5000 index. Since mid-July, the market capitalization of the index, which is made up of about 7,600 companies and is often used as a proxy for the entire stock market, has shrunk by nearly $2.5 trillion.
The rout has taken big swipes out of some longtime investor favorites. Coca-Cola, for example, lost $18.8 billion of market value yesterday, and since mid-July, the company's market value has shrunk by nearly $59 billion, or 26 percent.

HEADLINE: THE MARKET TURMOIL: POLICY;
Treasury Chief Seeks to Assure Jittery Investors

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 31

 BODY:
The sharp stock market selloff is likely to ripple through policy and politics, putting more pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates and threatening the air of prosperity that has been the foundation of President Clinton's political support, analysts and Government officials said today.
Yet unlike the much steeper stock market plunge in October 1987, the financial system handled today's fall in share prices without major problems, and the Clinton Administration hurriedly sent out Secretary of the Treasury Robert E. Rubin with soothing words about the continued soundness of the economy. 
 Mr. Rubin was back in Washington after two weeks of vacation. He said he had spoken during the day with the President, who was flying to Russia on Air Force One, during the afternoon as the market dropped precipitously, and with Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, who was on vacation in California.
A spokeswoman for the Federal Reserve, Lynn Fox, said the central bank had no comment on the market's decline. But economists said every sharp drop helped build a more compelling case that the economy could slow substantially in coming months and that a cut in interest rates would not only help avert a deeper downturn at home but also help restore confidence in badly battered world markets and economies.
"We may not be able to control the global wildfire, but by cutting rates we might be able to contain it," said Sung Won Sohn, an economist at the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis.
The Fed has until the last few weeks regarded inflation as the main threat to continuation of the nation's long economic expansion, which has driven unemployment down to 4.5 percent.
Many analysts think that the Fed will not reduce rates unless there is more compelling evidence that the domestic economy is sinking or the market slide accelerates so much that it endangers the stability of the financial system.
In 1987, Mr. Greenspan -- faced with a quicker market meltdown -- pressed lenders to make sure that they made credit available within the financial system and then cut interest rates to keep the economy from stalling.
But nearly 11 years later the banking and financial systems are much stronger than they were then, interest rates are already low by many standards, securities exchanges are better able to handle floods of orders, and officials and analysts said they saw no need for any immediate action to keep the markets functioning smoothly.
The market is different in another critical way, too. Compared with 1987, the stock market today is more broadly based, with many more households having invested in retirement programs and mutual funds. Compensation for many corporate executives is directly or indirectly tied to stock market performance through options, employee share-purchase programs and other means.
Allen Sinai of Primark Decision Economics said that the proportion of household wealth coming from the stock market was nearly 30 percent last month when the market was near its peak, up from 18.3 percent at the end of 1994.
As a result, economists said, consumers who have felt affluent and confident over the last few years as the market has surged, and therefore spent more money than they would have otherwise -- a phenomenon known as the "wealth effect" -- might now rein in their spending.
For the economy, that could mean slower growth. And any slowdown from dampened consumer spending would only compound the effects of a downturn in exports caused by the turmoil that has already sent much of Asia into recession and to a degree is now threatening Latin America.
While relatively few economists are predicting a recession in this country, even a sustained slowdown in growth could push unemployment higher, call into question the optimistic projections of big budget surpluses in coming years and leave Mr. Clinton without the bulwark of a rock-solid economy.
"The political implications are clearly related to how much consumers tighten their wallets," said Robert E. Litan, director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution. If they do, he said, and output growth "slows and unemployment grows, then the bloom has come off the rose and that would affect his standing."
With most of the Administration's economic team en route to Russia today and many of Mr. Clinton's political advisers traveling or on vacation, there was almost no public reaction from the White House.
But Mr. Rubin, who made a fortune navigating Wall Street's ups and downs as a partner at Goldman, Sachs before coming to Washington in 1993, restated today what has long been the Adminstration's approach to the markets: that in the long run they will reflect an economy's underlying strengths.
"The fundamentals of the United States economy are strong, due in part to the sound policies we have been following," he said, "and the prospects for growth with low inflation and low unemployment continue to be strong. The key is to continue on the right policy path, and particularly to maintain our fiscal discipline."
He urged countries caught up in economic crisis, especially Japan, to take the difficult steps needed to restore their strength. And he again urged Congress to provide $18 billion for the International Monetary Fund, which is running short of money just as the financial crisis threatens to spread to Latin America and elsewhere.
"It is particularly important that Japan, the second-largest economy in the world, move ahead with actions to put its economy back on track so it can be a source of strength in Asia and around the world," Mr. Rubin said.
The Treasury Secretary is scheduled to meet on Friday in San Francisco with his Japanese counterpart, Kiichi Miyazawa. Finance ministers from nine Latin American countries will meet with I.M.F. and American officials in Washington on Thursday and Friday to discuss what they can do to avoid the economic state that has befallen Russia.
Mr. Rubin said officials from the Treasury and the Federal Reserve were in contact throughout the day with their counterparts in the other big industrial nations, as well as financial market regulators in the United States including the Securities and Exchange Commission.
"The world is currently working its way through a difficult period," Mr. Rubin said.
"Our consultations indicate that the payment and settlement systems and other market mechanisms are working effectively," he added.
Mr. Rubin said the only problem had been at the Chicago Board Options Exchange, and that it had been taken care of. He provided no details.

HEADLINE: After a Holiday, Gore Campaigns in Midwest

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Aug. 31

 BODY:
Back on the campaign trail in Illinois and Ohio after his two-week holiday in Hawaii, Vice President Al Gore turned to his companions this morning on Air Force Two and asked, "Anything happen while I was gone?"
That was about as close as Mr. Gore came to alluding to the difficulties that are roiling the Clinton-Gore White House. Two weeks ago, there was the President's admission that he had had an improper relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky and had misled the American people about it. 
 Then, last week, Attorney General Janet Reno ordered a 90-day preliminary inquiry into whether Mr. Gore lied to investigators last year when he was interviewed about his telephone fund-raising solicitations from the White House.
And today, as Mr. Clinton headed for Moscow, Mr. Gore could not take solace in the choice of his friend, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, as Prime Minister by the embattled President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia. Mr. Chernomyrdin's nomination is in grave trouble.
But in his first interview since Mr. Clinton's disclosure about Ms. Lewinsky, Mr. Gore made clear that his strategy would be to say as little as possible about the tribulations that threaten to dog him until the November election and beyond -- to his own planned run for the Democratic nomination in 2000. He did not move beyond his statement of last week that he would be vindicated in the fund-raising matter and declined to discuss details of the Reno inquiry.
Asked whether Mr. Clinton had assured him he did not have a relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, Mr. Gore told reporters aboard Air Force Two, "I've never talked about my private conversations with the President, and I'm not going to start now."
The Vice President said he did not agree with Democrats who say they fear that the Lewinsky matter will be a major liability in this year's elections. Asked if he felt beleaguered, he said: "Not at all. Not at all."
Mr. Gore's calculation seems to be to stand close to his friend, the President, but not too close. For example, he acknowledged in the interview that he did not join Mr. Clinton in recent days in calling leading Democrats on Capitol Hill to reassure them that they would survive the Lewinsky matter.
But Mr. Gore insisted he was not distancing himself from the President, saying White House aides "didn't ask me to make a bunch of calls" because he was occupied with international issues like Russia and the American strikes in Sudan and Afghanistan.
Only when the interview turned from ethical questions to Russia did Mr. Gore appear comfortable, displaying his expertise on foreign policy.
As if to defy those who say the Administration is in trouble, Mr. Gore set off on a full round of campaign events. He started the day at a town meeting in Dayton, Ohio, with schoolchildren, then attended a fund-raising event for Mary Boyle, the Democratic nominee for senator from Ohio. Here in Chicago, Mr. Gore was the headline speaker at a convention of the Communications Workers of America, then he dedicated an AIDS prevention and care center, and ended the day at a fund-raising reception for the re-election of Senator Carol Moseley-Braun.
Though Mr. Gore said nothing about the developments that have buffeted the Administration, they were clearly on the minds of those in the audience. At the event for Ms. Boyle, the Vice President drew perhaps his most sustained applause of the day when he showed his allegiance to Mr. Clinton.
"Let me say this loudly and clearly: I am proud that Bill Clinton's policies have made this country a better place," he said. "I'm proud to serve with President Bill Clinton in helping to improve the lot of working families in America."
As if he were oblivious to his own party's problems, Mr. Gore turned his fury on the Republicans, asserting, "The Republican Party is in such disarray that the right hand doesn't know what the far right hand is doing."
But some in the audience said they feared that Mr. Clinton's ethical woes and the fund-raising questions threatened Mr. Gore's future.
"I feel for him both on the personal level and on the political level," said Jan Rudd, a veteran community worker and Democratic organizer in Dayton. "Already, you can see that Republicans across the country are using the Lewinsky issue against Democrats. Are they going to use it against Gore? Yes. Big time."
Bruce Jackson, a teacher who attended the Boyle event, said Mr. Gore might not be safe from the taint of the Lewinsky matter because "there's always the term, 'guilt by association,' but I'm more concerned that Reno says there should be an investigation."
As Mr. Gore was reciting the Clinton Administration's accomplishments in education and the economy, Mr. Jackson jabbed his thumb toward the Vice President in the distance and said, "Any time you're in politics you're going to be remembered more for the problems than the good. That's why he's harping on the good today."
But Jim Ruvolo, a former chairman of the state's Democratic Party, said Mr. Clinton's trouble over the Lewinsky matter should be the least of Mr. Gore's worries. "Gore's running mate is the economy," he said, speaking of 2000, "not Bill Clinton."

HEADLINE: THE MARKET TURMOIL: VOICES;
'It's Disturbing, to Put It Mildly,' But Investors Say They'll Hold On

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN 

 BODY:
Gloom, fear, pain and queasiness. Around the nation, anxieties ran high yesterday as investors big and small watched the jagged lines fall and much of the year's profits evaporate in a breathtaking 512-point plunge on Wall Street. Many called it scary, but almost no one seemed ready to panic.
The paper losses were heavy. But conditioned by years of bull-market bravado and still confident in the fundamental soundness of the nation's economy, most investors interviewed in New York, Atlanta, Boston, Denver, Los Angeles, Miami, Seattle and elsewhere voiced expectations that the market would bounce back. They also said they had no intention of getting out, not yet anyway. 
 "I'm not thrilled," Germaine Meilach, 61, an Upper East Side investor, said as she sipped a drink at a sidewalk cafe after the market's cascading close. "But I still feel things are good. I don't see a reason to panic. You can't have 28 percent earnings all the time. I think people would be foolish to get out. We have to be patient."
In Seattle, Peter Hurley, a city planner, agreed, though he lost 10 percent of his net worth yesterday. "It's disturbing, to put it mildly," he said. "But I'm taking the long view of it. The fundamentals are no different from a few weeks ago, but obviously the psychology is very different. We tend to think we're so damn logical, but we're still driven by fear and desire."
In Atlanta, Burdie Henry, who has stocks and mutual funds, sounded like a Wall Street pro. "I'm going to ride it out," she said. "I'm concerned, but I understand that if you're going to invest in the stock market you can't panic at certain things. I think you have to have a certain temperament, and if you panic with every change you probably shouldn't be in the market."
And in Stamford, Conn., Josephine C. McArthur, 52, the president of an after-school enrichment center for children, said she planned to hang tough in a market that had been good to her in recent years. "It's like childbirth," she said. "It's not easy when you're going through it, but after the pains your whole life is better. The party's not over for me."
No one seemed oracular. There were brokerage-house jokes about looking for tall buildings or jumping out first-floor windows. One investor called himself a cautious bull. Many spoke of the market plunge as a long-expected correction.
Maybe some investors were whistling past the graveyard, but many said they had sound reasons for staying in the market.
"If you look at just the fundamentals of the market place, nothing has changed," Kelly Keydel, an independent financial planner in Seattle, said. "There's low inflation, low interest rates, a very strong economy, and unemployment is low. Nothing has changed. People are nervous, but they need to stay the course."
Doug MacLennan, 28, a Merrill Lynch employee, echoed the opinion of many, saying he was in for the long haul and would only lose money if he sold out now. "It's terrible, but I'm a long-term investor and I'm going to wait it out. I try not to look at the daily highs and lows. It's too depressing. But I don't want to get out of the market because I'll realize all my losses."
Others justified what happened yesterday by noting that the market was overheated and due for an adjustment anyway. They said they were way ahead over the years and could afford to take some losses.
"It isn't surprising," Brian Shearer-Kearney, a 41-year-old Nebraskan who was passing through the Minneapolis airport, said of the market plunge. "The stock market had no reason to be doing as well as it was. Most of the country is pretty strong." As for the market, he added: "Eventually it will turn around."
No investors said the fall necessarily foreshadowed a recession, or even a much deeper plunge. And a few said they would soon be looking for buying opportunities.
"It looks like a pretty good buying opportunity," said Dennis Schouten, a certified public accountant in Denver, who stopped at a discount brokerage firm yesterday and calmly sipped iced coffee as the market dipped and dived.
Shirley G. Jarvis, 55, a saleswoman in Norwalk, Conn., said, "Maybe it'll get beaten down enough that I can sneak in and buy 100 shares of Microsoft."
"During past corrections, "I sat on the sidelines and missed my opportunity," said Ms. Jarvis, who described herself as a small investor but said she had learned some lessons from the long bull market. "Then six months later, it was back up. It always seems to be a slow, steady climb back."
Ray B. Washington, 54, a program manager for I.B.M. who lives in Stamford, went golfing yesterday to escape the grim bulletins of co-workers who surfed the Internet to take in the falling graphs. Mr. Washington, who called himself a cautious bull, quipped, "I know some guys who want to jump out of the office window, but we chain them down to desks."
Many investors, like Dilyn Loveless, a 21-year-old senior at Emory University in Atlanta who has small- company and technology stocks, said they were less jittery because they had other income to live on and did not have to depend on the market.
"If I had to live off the money I had invested," Ms. Loveless said, "I would certainly be struggling."
Daniel Thomas, a 28-year-old investment specialist in Denver, said that his own investments were long-term and that his age was a factor in his optimistic attitude toward the market. "I have about 20 or 30 years before I have to worry about retirement," he said.
Though no one was panicking, some expressed concern for small investors, and for retirees and elderly people on fixed incomes whose losses were felt disproportionately.
"For a year now, anyone over the age of 50 was nervous, and anyone under the age of 45 was still confident," said Elliot Herskowitz, 69, a former partner in a Wall Street brokerage firm. "The older people had lived through the 1970's, when the market went down 40 percent. Unless you lived through it, unless you knew the water torture where every day it goes down, little by little, you didn't know."
Brett Goldberg, an importer in Stamford, spoke of another kind of market fear: "It's sort of like knowing that your child is one of a bunch of kids playing out in the street and all of a sudden you hear a big screech and a crash and your first thought is, 'God, I hope it's not my stocks. God, don't let it be Intel.' "
For Carmen Diaz, who works at Prudential Insurance in Newark, the day's slide, which resonated with other falling markets around the world, was proof of the global interdependence of the financial world. "It tells me that we are all in this together," she said. "It makes you feel a little insecure. But what can I do? Take the money out and hide it under my mattress?"
Like many of the Wall Street experts, William H. Horton, a lawyer, said as he scanned the financial news on a tote board in a Newark office that economic problems in Russia, Asia and elsewhere were factors in the fall. But, like others, he scoffed at the notion that President Clinton's personal troubles over his affair with a White House intern constituted a significant factor.
A few more-or-less lucky investors, like Gary McFelia, who works on Wall Street, could afford to gloat a bit yesterday, having started weeks ago to withdraw from the market. Mr. McFelia began about a month ago and liquidated about half of his investments. "I wish I'd done a little more than I did," he said.
Ron Ries, an Internal Revenue Service examiner who paused to watch a tote board as he headed for a commuter train in Newark, stood in a small group and put the big issue to no one in particular: "Well, the question is are we going into a great depression, or is this an overreaction? I personally think it's an overreaction."
In Atlanta, Steven C. Moreland, a physician, seemed to sum it up for nearly everybody: "It was a bloody day, and I don't know whether it's stopped bleeding yet. The long term, I think, is really positive. I may eat those words, but it sounds good."

Auction of Kia Canceled After Low Bids

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 31

 BODY:
The auction of two South Korean auto makers was canceled tonight because none of the four initial bids met the sellers' minimum price.
Despite robust auto sales in North America and Europe, most of the world's 33 mass-production auto makers are losing money. There are enough surplus auto factories around the globe to supply the entire United States market. 
 But auto makers remain important sources of employment and symbols of national strength in many countries, making governments reluctant to allow their closure or sale to foreign investors. Such worries appeared to have played a role this week in the failed auction of the Kia Motors Corporation and its truck-making affiliate, the Asia Motors Company Ltd.
Kia and Asia Motors were put up for sale together this summer by their creditor banks after becoming unable to make payments on their many debts, which total an estimated $10 billion. But with some of the largest banks now financially troubled and effectively controlled by the South Korean Government, the terms of the auction went far beyond a conventional sale to the highest bidder. Instead, the terms required each bidder to submit a business plan to maintain exports and invest more cash. The auction's terms also required that bids include a stiff price for the auto makers' shares and an agreement to repay all of the auto makers' debt.
None of the bids, which came from the Ford Motor Company, Daewoo, Hyundai and Samsung, met all of these conditions, Korean officials announced on Tuesday morning in Seoul, when it was still Monday night here in Detroit. Lee Jong Dae, Kia's president, did not set a date for a new auction.
The apparent failure of the auction lessens the likelihood that Kia or Asia Motors will close any factories soon, despite their losses. So the global car market is likely to remain glutted, depressing prices and profits. The difficulties with the auction also represent a broad setback for South Korea's efforts to streamline its industrial sector, which suffers from heavy debts and excessive staffs in many industries.
Auto industry deals actually taking place now are unlikely to reduce excess global capacity.
The Chrysler Corporation is preparing to merge later this year with Daimler-Benz A.G., for example, but the two auto makers have almost completely different lineups of vehicles and no plans to close factories.
Robert J. Eaton, Chrysler's chairman and chief executive, said in an interview today that despite the recent plunge in stock markets around the globe, the planned merger would proceed. In the merger, shareholders of both companies would turn in their stock for shares in the combined company, DaimlerChrysler A.G.
Chrysler shares tumbled 13.5 percent last Thursday but partly rebounded on Friday. The stock fell last Thursday on speculation that the Daimler merger might not take place because Russia's economic and political troubles had caused the German stock market to plummet, dragging Daimler shares down.
But the United States market has also been battered since then. Mr. Eaton said this morning that there had been no discussion of renegotiating the merger terms. The merger would be affected only if the performance of the German and American stock markets diverged dramatically and the share prices of Daimler and Chrysler also diverged, he said, adding that he believed this was very unlikely.
"As long as the markets move relatively the same, I don't see any impact," Mr. Eaton said.
Another recently announced auto industry transaction also appears unlikely to relieve the industry's excess capacity. The Toyota Motor Corporation announced on Friday that it would spend $259 million to raise its stake in the Daihatsu Motor Company Ltd. to 51.2 percent. But Toyota's previous stake of 34.5 percent had already given it control of Daihatsu, which is strongest in the manufacture of very small cars, one of Toyota's few weaknesses.
The Kia sale has attracted international attention because American, European and Japanese auto makers have worried that a buyer that accepted the company with all of its debts could be forced to dump large numbers of low-priced Kia cars on international markets, in a possibly futile attempt to keep up with interest payments.
Chrysler did not bid on Kia, partly because it is still busy with the Daimler merger and partly because Chrysler executives were dubious about the profitability of East Asian markets even before the region's financial crisis began. "The only way Kia would be attractive to anybody would be if you restructured or reduced the debt," Mr. Eaton said today.

To the Editor:
Paul Krugman (Op-Ed, Aug. 30) highlights the part played by a handful of men -- Alan Greenspan, chairman of the United States Federal Reserve, and his few banking counterparts in other developed countries -- in the world's economic future. 
 What puzzles me is why the global economy is almost always considered to be a free market economy with only competition creating wealth. With less than a dozen people calling the shots, it seems that this is a distorted conception of the market. It is almost Orwellian to be so dependent on the analytical powers of a few and yet be told that the market is self-regulating.

To the Editor:
The photographs of Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, President Clinton, Helmut Kohl of Germany, Jiang Zemin of China and Keizo Obuchi of Japan that accompany "It's a Bad Time for Weak Leadership" (Week in Review, Aug. 30) are captioned, "None of these men is Churchill." 
 Since the crises these leaders are facing are economic and financial, that is just as well. While my generation reveres Winston Churchill for defending our freedom while Great Britain stood alone before Hitler in 1940 and 1941, he was a terrible Chancellor of the Exchequer in Stanley Baldwin's Conservative Government. He returned Great Britain in 1925 to the gold standard, a move denounced by John Maynard Keynes. From this action flowed deflation, unemployment and the general strike of 1926.
In "The Private Lives of Winston Churchill," John Pearson recalls Churchill saying over dinner: "Everyone said I was the worst Chancellor of the Exchequer that ever was. And now I'm inclined to agree with them. So now the world's unanimous."

To the Editor:
While James K. Galbraith (Op-Ed, Aug. 28) is right that wages begin to equalize during times of low unemployment and that we should aim Federal policy to minimizing unemployment, he neglects the essence of the causal relationship. Low unemployment leads to equalizing wages because with fewer candidates for jobs, there is less distinction among candidates. Employers therefore must offer more for less. 
 The equalized wages sought by Mr. Galbraith would mean there would be no benefit to bettering one's professional skills. We each compete to provide the best for our prospective employers and to demand the compensation due. Why should we strive to shrink a wage gap that is the natural and beneficial result of employer market forces?

TYSON FOODS TO TAKE $196 MILLION CHARGE TO SHUT PLANTS

BYLINE: Reuters 

 BODY:
Tyson Foods Inc., the leading United States chicken processor, said yesterday that it would record charges of $196 million in its fourth quarter, ending on Oct. 3, as it streamlines production at its poultry plants and accounts for losses in Russia and Asia. Tyson, based in Springdale, Ark., announced plans last month to close plants, cut its work force and write down goodwill, but it did not disclose the dollar amounts until yesterday. Tyson also announced plans to scale down its seafood operations, which consist mainly of fishing boats. The charges will probably result in a loss for the fourth quarter, but not necessarily for the full year, Tyson said. Tyson's stock closed down $1.125 yesterday, to $16.50, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: TURMOIL IN RUSSIA: THE OVERVIEW;
Russian Legislators Reject Prime Minister Candidate

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Aug. 31

 BODY:
Russia's Parliament today emphatically rejected President Boris N. Yeltsin's choice for Prime Minister after a rancorous debate, leaving the nation virtually rudderless in the midst of its deepening economic crisis.
Viktor S. Chernomyrdin implored lawmakers to approve his appointment as Prime Minister, saying he urgently needed to start forming a new government. 
 "Russia today is, in essence, on the verge of economic and political breakdown," he declared on a day in which Russia was still struggling to halt the slide of its currency and prevent the collapse of its banking and financial system. "Russia should not be without a government."
But the appeal drew jeers from the Communist-led opposition, which controls the lower house of Parliament. In the first of as many as three votes on his nomination, they rejected Mr. Chernomyrdin by a vote of 253 to 94 with the help of the other left-wing parties, the nationalists and the liberal opposition. Mr. Chernomyrdin needed 226 votes in the 450 seat Parliament to be approved but got only the support of his own party and an assortment of independents.
The Communists' strategy seemed to be discredit the Yeltsin Government in the hope that the embattled President would finally be driven to resign or at least agree to a more generous power-sharing arrangement. The lopsided rejection also seemed aimed at torpedoing Mr. Chernomyrdin's claim that only he could unify the splintered nation and serve as Mr. Yeltsin's heir.
But Mr. Yeltsin demonstrated tonight that he was also ready to engage in political brinksmanship, as he has so many times in the past. The President immediately renominated Mr. Chernomyrdin, and his advisers warned that the Parliament would be dissolved if it refused to yield, a worrisome prospect for many deputies who have grown comfortable with the free apartments and other perquisites of their office and who might fear a national election.
That set the stage for a new round of horse-trading over government posts and policies in the days ahead. If Parliament rejects Mr. Yeltsin's choice for Prime Minister three times, the President can dissolve the body and call for new parliamentary elections.
"President Boris Yeltsin wants Viktor Chernomyrdin to become the Prime Minister, and I do not recall a case such as this where he has changed his mind," said Boris Berezovsky, the tycoon who has sought to orchestrate Mr. Chernomyrdin's return to power.
Mr. Berezovsky should know; it was his opposition that Mr. Yeltsin defied just four months ago through three confirmation battles in the Parliament to put Sergei Kiriyenko into the Prime Minister's job from which he was dismissed last week.
On the eve of a Russian-American summit meeting, the angry standoff left the United States facing a meeting with a determined but embattled Russian leadership with no real government in place and the prospect of political, as well as economic, implosion growing by the day.
Today's acrimony marked an abrupt end to days of lofty talk of compromise and coalition government intended to secure a bloodless confirmation for Mr. Chernomyrdin.
"We got all the consent," Mr. Chernomyrdin complained to reporters after today's debate. "And all of sudden everything is destroyed."
Communist lawmakers said today that the negotiations broke down over a deadline for enacting amendments to the Constitution that shift some power from the executive branch to the legislature, among other power-sharing arrangements.
Aleksandr Shokhin, the leader of Mr. Chernomyrdin's parliamentary faction, suggested that the acting Prime Minister might still be able to mollify the Communist opposition and salvage his nomination.
Mr. Shokhin suggested that Mr. Chernomyrdin might identify his Cabinet choices and spell out his economic policy before the next vote on his nomination.
The idea would be to reassure wary lawmakers that if he became Prime Minister, he would honor his promises to left-wing politicians.
Market reformers warned that there was a danger that Mr. Chernomyrdin might now go too far in trying to placate the Communists.
Anatoly B. Chubais, who was dismissed from his post as the Yeltsin Government's negotiator with the International Monetary Fund, warned that the Kremlin would be making a grave mistake if it gave away the Finance and Economics Ministries.
"I don't know a single economist from the left side of the spectrum who is capable of proposing anything reasonable to resolve the crisis," Mr. Chubais said.
As Russia's politicians traded insults during today's debate, it was sometimes hard to tell that the nation was grasping for ways to stem the decline of its currency, fight inflation and save its banking system.
Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the strident nationalist, mocked President Clinton for his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. Sergei Dubinin, the head of the Central Bank, defended a loan he received to build a dacha.
Gennadi A. Zyuganov, the Communist leader, complained that Mr. Chernomyrdin's approval rating stood at a meager 7 percent.
Mr. Chernomyrdin derided his predecessor, Sergei Kiriyenko, 36, for leading a "kid's government" and blamed him for the nation's economic ills, even though most economists say Mr. Kiriyenko was struggling to correct policies that were decided during Mr. Chernomyrdin's first term as Prime Minister.
When Mr. Chernomyrdin addressed the financial crisis, his economic prescriptions were vague, halting and at times nearly incoherent.
He said that the Government should use credits to boost Russia's stricken industrial sector but conceded in the same breath that the government had no money.
He said that the Yeltsin Government decision to devalue the ruble was a mistake, but gave no hint of how he planned to prop up the nation's sagging currency.
He said he would not allow the banking system to collapse, but gave no details about how he could prevent the bankruptcy of some of the nation's leading banks.
His dominant policy goal since being selected as Prime Minister last week, he said, was simply to avoid a total financial collapse before he formed a new government and tried to figure out what to do. "The important thing was to hold on until the end of August," he said.
Before departing for the summit meeting in Russia, President Clinton said today that the West should help Russia as long as it continues to embrace capitalism, and he warned that any return to a centralized economy would backfire.
"What I want to do is to go there and tell them that the easy thing to do is not the right thing to do," Mr. Clinton said, in an appearance in an elementary school gymnasium in Herndon, Va., to promote his education proposals. "The easy thing to do would be to try to go back the way they did it before, and it's not possible."
But, he said, "If they will stay on the path of reform to stabilize their society and to strengthen their economy and to get growth back, then I believe America and the rest of the Western nations with strong economies should help them."
Mr. Clinton said it was in America's interest to help the Russians for two reasons: Because a strong Russia can play a role in resolving regional conflicts, such as the one in Kosovo; and because of Russia's nuclear arsenal.
"We don't want terrorists to get a hold of weapons of mass destruction," he said. "A weakened Russia, a weakened Russian economy would put enormous pressure on people who have those technologies and understandings to sell them. We don't want that to happen."
Declaring that "we are living in a smaller and smaller world," Mr. Clinton said that he had decided to go forward with his trip "because we have learned the hard way that problems that develop beyond our borders sooner or later find their way to our doorstep unless we help our friends and our neighbors to deal with them as quickly and promptly as possible."
 Mr. Clinton, looking relaxed, arrived in Moscow on Tuesday with his wife, Hillary, and was greeted by Mr. Chernomyrdin as they left Air Force One on a bleak, wet morning at the Vnukovo-2 airport, Reuters reported.
 The circus-like atmosphere of the debate in Moscow contrasted with grim economic news. Russia's stock market was so depressed that there were only three transactions during its first two hours.
Stock in Gazprom dropped sharply as word spread that Mr. Chernomyrdin's nomination was in trouble. Mr. Chernomyrdin served as head of the gas monopoly before first joining the Yeltsin Government, and investors have assumed that his return to power would benefit the company.
Some reformers were predicting the worst might be yet to come.
"A severe financial-economic rollback, lasting for years, not months, is in store for Russia," Mr. Chubais said.

Gore Sees Hope for Reform
 CHICAGO, Aug. 31 (By The New York Times) -- Vice President Al Gore, an important voice in the Administration's dealings with Russia, said today that reforms there were still possible despite the emergence of hard-line leaders.
"The Communists in Russia today are not the same as Communists of 50 years ago," Mr. Gore said told reporters on his plane traveling here. "And the idea that their participation in some coalition would represent a return to Leninism or Stalinism is just as almost certainly wrong."
He said "labels alone are not any longer the best guide to what these people are advocating."
Mr. Gore continued: "I don't want to put too bright a face on it. The fact is, we don't know what's going to happen there. But a lot of the changes in Russia that have taken place are irreversible. And the damage done by 70 years of Communism are, naturally, difficult to overcome."
Asked how weak President Yeltsin had become, Mr. Gore said, "Well, I don't want to create a diplomatic incident here. He's still President of Russia. But obviously there are negotiations under way that include consideration of how much authority he will designate to his choice as Prime Minister. And that in turn could trigger negotiations about how much power might be reshuffled from the executive branch to the legislative branch."

State's Emergency Fund Swells to $500 Million

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: HARTFORD

 BODY:
Connecticut has nearly $500 million in its emergency fund after closing the last fiscal year with a $610 million surplus.
Gov. John G. Rowland yesterday handed a ceremonial check for $160 million to State Treasurer Paul Silvester, bringing the rainy day fund to 5 percent of the general fund budget. Bond rating agencies, which set the interest rates on payments made by the state for money it borrows, recommend that emergency funds reach the 5 percent threshold. 
 In addition to padding the emergency fund, the state's seventh straight surplus helped pay the $124.5 million cost of tax rebate checks that many taxpayers received this summer. It also was spent on retiring state debt, increasing payments to towns that lose money on tax-exempt property and readying state computers for the year 2000 date change.
Governor Rowland shrugged off the suggestion that a robust economy created the windfall, and instead attributed the fiscal strength of the state to his trim budgets. But State Comptroller Nancy Wyman, a Democrat, said record-setting tax revenues were behind the surplus.

Big Cinema Planned For Jamaica Center

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
National Amusements, the Massachusetts-based parent company of Viacom Inc., has announced plans to develop a 15-screen, 3,200-seat movie theater complex at Jamaica Center in Queens.
The project, which is to be built on a city-owned site bounded by Jamaica and Archer Avenues, 160th Street and Parsons Boulevard, represents the single largest private investment in the neighborhood in recent memory. In addition to the multiplex, the 500,000-square-foot-complex is to feature retail and class A office space as well as a parking garage. Construction is scheduled to begin this fall and should be completed by spring of 2000. 
 Gap and Gap Kids, Walgreens and Old Navy stores have committed to the project.
The total cost of the project is approximately $95 million. The city will provide $11 million through its Economic Development Corporation. Another $3 million will be supplied by the state through the Metropolitan Economic Revitalization Fund.
"This project will provide a real boost to the local economy activity and is expected to generate 514 new jobs and 560 construction jobs for local residents," Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said. NICK RAVO

As foreign and domestic investors fled to the safe harbor of the United States Treasury market yesterday, talk was growing of a market-calming interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve.
The surge in Treasury buying came in the afternoon, as the stock market lost its footing and the Dow Jones industrial plunged to its second-worst one-day point decline ever. The yield on the 30-year bond dropped to 5.25 percent, the lowest for long-term rates in 30 years and a level that many or most of those who work on Wall Street have not experienced in their working lifetimes. The yield on the 10-year note fell to 4.96 percent, the first time it has been below 5 percent since 1967. 
 As the growing global economic crisis seems daily to impinge more on the still healthy American economy, several analysts have predicted that the 12 percent decline in the Dow in the last week would help force the Federal Reserve to lower its benchmark short-term interest rate soon.
"They can't ignore the message of the market," said John Lipsky, chief economist at Chase Manhattan Bank, referring to the fact that long-term interest rates are well below the Fed's 5.5 percent target for short-term rates. "And the message of the market is that the risks are heavily weighted on the side of a slowdown."
Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at Hoenig & Company, said the stock market fall also should prompt action by the Fed. "This now constitutes a breathtaking decline that central banks are supposed to pay attention to," he said.
The recent rapid decline in interest rates should provide some offset to the drag from Asia, as lower rates spur the housing industry.
The plunge in the 10-year note, which is a benchmark for mortgage rates, should mean that already low mortgage rates drop further.
But Mr. Lipsky argues that the economy has too much drag. At the present time, he said, the Fed's 5.5 percent target for the Federal funds rate -- the rate on overnight loans between banks -- is higher after adjustment for inflation than at the end of 1994. That was when the Mexican peso was devalued, setting off a market selloff that was serious but paled by comparison with the plunge in both developed and emerging markets around the world.
He also said that the 19 percent plunge in the Dow since July 17 was sure to make consumers more cautious, cutting into their strong spending that has kept the economy -- even though it slowed in the second quarter -- stronger than many forecasters had expected.
This slowdown by the consumer, plus the already painful drop in American exports because of the evaporation of buying from Asia, should slow the economy to no growth in the second half of the year, he said -- a reason for the Fed to ease.
Mr. Barbera argued that the Fed had to lower its interest rate to ease the pressure on the troubled emerging markets, most of which have large debts denominated in dollars that have to be rolled over soon.
Federal Reserve policy makers are next scheduled to meet on Sept. 29. At their Aug. 18 meeting they decided, as expected, to leave their short-term interest rate target unchanged.
In the minutes of the July meeting Fed officials showed no inclination toward cutting interest rates, in part because the economy was still strong and there were signs of inflationary wage pressures.
Fed policy makers can act, however, at any time between meetings. As the Asian economic crisis has spread to engulf Russia and to threaten Latin America all talk of a Fed rate increase has disappeared. But there is still a debate among economists over if and when the Fed would decide to lower interest rates.
It is possible that Fed officials could ease some concerns with just a hint, in a speech or comment, that the Fed is watching and ready to take action if necessary. The Fed did announce yesterday that its chairman, Alan Greenspan, was monitoring the markets while on vacation.
Some analysts said the Fed was unlikely to act immediately because that might be interpreted as a sign of panic. But the Fed took such action in the past with the interest rate cut after the stock market crash in 1987.
With yesterday's decline in Treasury interest rates, the 30-year bond yield of 5.25 percent, the 10-year note yield of 4.96 percent, the five-year note yield of 4.78 percent and the two-year note yield of 4.76 percent are all below the 5.5 percent Fed target for the Federal funds rate.
This is known as an inverted yield curve and has, in the past, signaled a slowdown for the economy or even a recession. That has been because the Federal funds rate moved higher than longer-term rates as the Fed raised its target to slow economic growth.
In this case, the inversion has been produced by a drop in longer-term rates as the Fed left its target rate unchanged. But while this appears to be less negative, it seems to be signaling a slowdown anyway.
One reason is that the high level of short-term interest rates, after adjustment for inflation, is a drag on the economy. Another is that the flight to a safe harbor is a signal of weakening economic prospects abroad, which, in turn, are bad for the American outlook.
Analysts said that both the flight to a safe harbor and the realization that the American economy was slowing should push interest rates even lower. But if some calm returns to both foreign and American markets, there could be a selloff that could force interest rates higher temporarily. Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three-month and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: 'Titanic,' the Promotion, Lands at Video Stores

BYLINE: By BARBARA STEWART 

 BODY:
It is not often that the release of a video generates a promotional blitz, but when the video is that of the highest-grossing movie of all time, it is a sure bet that video stores will make the biggest splash possible to draw in as much money as possible.
And while today's 12:01 A.M. release of "Titanic," for sale or rental, probably didn't need much hype -- smitten fans of Leonardo DiCaprio alone are likely to be responsible for millions in sales and rentals -- video stores in and around New York nonetheless spent the day yesterday making it clear that the movie about the ship had come in. 
 At Video Room on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, employees were unpacking 300 "Titanic" videos, a relatively large number. The plan was to sell 200 copies and rent the other 100. By contrast, the store bought 60 rental copies of "As Good as It Gets," an Academy Award-winning film that proved to be one of its most popular rentals.
At Couch Potato on Second Avenue in Manhattan -- known primarily for its stock of foreign films and hard-to-find classics -- the owner, Michael Mark, could not ignore the potential "Titanic" profits.
"You're a video store," he said, "and this is the biggest video in the history of the world, right? It behooves me to have it."
But the splashiest, most Titanic-sized promotions were held at the 240 Blockbuster stores in New York and New Jersey and on Long Island; all had planned to stay open until 2 A.M. today. At least one of those Blockbusters -- and it seemed unlikely that it was the only one -- violated the official release date and rented the tapes over the weekend.
Last night's midnight promotions, planned months ago at Blockbuster's corporate office in Dallas, centered, naturally, on ice. Stores were to give a free rental to the customer who lugged in the largest chunk of ice, and T-shirts were frozen in blocks of ice for people to chip out.
But in some areas the hype exceeded the reality. In Manhattan, only a handful of people lined up at two big stores on Lexington Avenue: an HMV store at 86th Street and a Blockbuster store at 85th Street. Indeed, both stores were rather quiet as the clock struck 12.
And while the Bay Ridge store in Brooklyn, at 612-634 86th Street, displayed a 1,500-pound ice sculpture of the ship, only a few people bothered to stay after the sculpting to await the release of the video.
Bob Gehringer, the video chain's corporate regional manager, said a record number of people had previously put down $5 of the $24.99 purchase price to reserve a copy.
As 20 million copies of the video were shipped to stores, similar promotions were going on across the country. The Associated Press reported that managers at the Tower Video store on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles planned to deck out the store like a ship.
Behind the race to sell "Titanic" tapes as quickly as possible was chilly economics. The demand for the videos will probably sink nearly as fast as the ship.
"It will reach saturation point early," said Michael Becker, the owner of Video Room, at Third Avenue and 84th Street. "This movie will die off in two or three weeks, a lot quicker than most." He attributed that to the many tapes available for sale through video stores, members-only warehouse stores and big general-purpose stores like Wal-Mart.
And, Mr. Becker said, relatively few will want to rent it. People who loved it and want to see it over and over will buy, not rent, he said.
Bargain hunters should wait a few weeks, he said. "A lot of stores will be depleting their inventory soon and the rental copies will be cheaper."
But for the next week or two, even esoteric video stores are plunging in. "We ordered seven or eight to rent," said Richard Mailman, manager of Kim's Video on Avenue A on the Lower East Side. "The people who frequent this store are not the "Titanic" type -- but the price is so low we can afford a few extra to rent, just in case."
And the managers of video stores that cater to a mainstream market say they are expecting to sell record numbers of "Titanic" tapes.
Video Den in Wyckoff, N.J., has cleared eight shelves to display its 48 copies for sale and 48 for rent. "Usually we buy 12 copies to rent," said Deborah Gelok, the manager.

Japan by the Bowlful, Con Brio

BYLINE: By Eric Asimov 

 BODY:
FINDING a reasonably priced restaurant in midtown is almost always a compromise, which is a polite way of saying that if the food is cheap, it's usually not very good, the restaurant's not very comfortable and the service is not very polite. Then, along comes Ya Bowl to prove that even this rule has its exceptions.
This sweet little Japanese restaurant opened five months ago just on the fringe of Times Square, and while the atmosphere is unmistakably Japanese, the small dining room could almost be mistaken for any New York living room. Posters of French advertisements and an orchestra conductor adorn one wall, while another is lined with bookshelves holding such unlikely titles as "Jewish Marital Status" and "Microwave Entertaining," along with a selection of videotapes and CD's. 
 The decor is not entirely random. Kimbo Ishii-Eto, the son of the charming owner, Mien Eto, is music director of the Gemini Youth Orchestra on Long Island and has conducted with the Boston Symphony Orchestra and the New York Philharmonic. He's on the poster, those are his CD's on the wall, and when the background music isn't jazz, that's likely to be his music you're hearing.
Ms. Eto is a proud mother, but she's also proud of her little restaurant. Meals often begin with a freebie, like a little bowl of delicious pickled daikon, the mildly bitter radish complemented by a sweet sesame dressing. Or it might be a bowl of fragrant miso soup, with little chunks of tofu, or a pleasant salad.
At lunch and dinner, you can order the sushi combination for just $14.50, usually including yellowtail, shrimp, a sweet eel roll, salmon and maybe bream or snapper. It's fresh, but unremarkable, seemingly on the menu because it's expected.
The raison d'etre of Ya Bowl is the bowl meals, one-pot meals in which hot food is served over rice in a bowl, a delicious and economical method. Salmon teriyaki ($12.50) is typical -- a well-cooked salmon steak brushed with sweet teriyaki sauce, which drips into the rice below. Even better is the unusual sukiyaki ($9.75), the beef-and-vegetable stew, which is simmered in a sweet soy sauce and, this time, served with egg over rice. Chicken cutlet ($9.50), a boneless breast pounded thin and deep-fried, is crisp and greaseless and is especially good flavored with a mild curry sauce ($10.50), a popular adopted food in Japan. Ya Bowl also serves excellent soba ($10.50), brown buckwheat noodles, in a sweet sauce of soy and rice wine.
Prices are slightly higher at dinner, but the expanded menu also includes more appetizers, like edamame ($4.50), fresh soybeans that are boiled and salted, sort of a Japanese bar snack; boiled spinach served in a sesame dressing ($4.50), and gyoza ($6.50), delicate yet savory pan-fried dumplings.
Before Ms. Eto opened Ya Bowl, she lived in Vienna, where her son studied music, and her desserts show the influence of the Viennese coffeehouses: a selection of rich, creamy cakes ($6 each), including wonderful chocolate espresso cake and fair strawberry cake, served with strong coffee. If you come by Ya Bowl in the afternoon, in fact, Ms. Eto turns it into a coffeehouse, serving desserts with coffee and tea.
I've always found the service at Ya Bowl swift and pleasant, except at lunch on Wednesdays, when the throngs visiting Times Square for Broadway matinees descend. Here's a tip: Go early.

HEADLINE: Hard-Charging Bulls and Red Flags

BYLINE: By Ron Chernow; Ron Chernow is the author of "Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller Sr."

 BODY:
No bull market in American history has been so avidly tracked as that of the 1990's. For eight years, we have watched this expanding balloon with a sense of collective wonder, transfixed by our unending prosperity.
Measured purely in terms of popular participation, this market has eclipsed anything seen before. Where only a quarter of Americans dabbled in stocks before the 1987 plunge, nearly half now own stocks, either directly or through mutual funds. By comparison, the roaring market of the Jazz Age, with its paltry three million investors, seems a mere sideshow. 
 Yet for all the attention paid to this bull market, few analysts spotted the glaring symptoms of a huge speculative bubble, which was finally pricked this summer by the simultaneous crises in Russia and East Asia. These weren't subtle signals but classic indicators -- many of them seen in the 1920's and all of them sadly familiar to students of financial history.
One telltale sign was the way the stock market became ubiquitous in our popular culture, moving from the margins to the center of our consciousness. Whenever the stock market seems to drive the economy, not mirror it, we are headed for trouble. And this time, the phenomenon was more pronounced than ever before. Even during the Reagan years, the evening news programs didn't monitor the market closely, whereas in the 1990's Messrs. Rather, Brokaw and Jennings updated us nightly on the market's triumphal march. Stock market gurus grew as fashionable and recognizable as rock stars.
During the past two years, the euphoric market has become less a white-collar bastion and more a blue-collar casino. As ever in financial history, the entry of the "little people" onto the financial stage suggested that the curtain was set to drop. And again, the magnitude of the trend should have made the danger unmistakable. Small investors grew so enamored of stocks that they abandoned the musty security of bank deposits, which now hold just 26.6 percent of household financial assets -- the lowest such percentage in 50 years. Today, 57.6 percent of those assets are allocated to equities. Americans now have more personal wealth stashed away in the stock market than in their homes.
As happened in the 1920's, high-spirited contemporary pundits promised us endless blue skies, a world blessedly free of market corrections, business cycles and bear markets. Their case for the bull market hardened into a mantra, chanted ad infinitum by many brokerage house analysts: the combination of low inflation, low interest rates and slow growth might last forever. Throw in the productivity of computer technology and a balanced budget and you had an indestructible wealth machine. That a speculative bubble could coexist with a sound economic boom -- that it could, in fact, be inspired by an unusually prolonged expansion -- was scarcely mentioned as a possibility.
Once these pundits decided that the gods had vouchsafed perfect economic conditions to the United States in the 1990's, they soon concluded that all conventional methods of market valuation were outmoded. We were told that a new era justified whatever giddy prices investors assigned to stocks -- the sort of hyperbole that reverberated throughout the 20's, and that should have raised another red flag. In April, the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the market had attained its highest price-to-earnings ratio in 100 years, sure proof of speculative excess. Yet the market, immune to all such assertions of common sense, streaked ahead.
One myth of the 1920's was the ardent faith that, with the creation of the Federal Reserve Board in 1913, the United States had acquired a modern financial system that would render crashes obsolete. Similarly, in the 1990's investors endowed Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, with magical powers, assuring themselves that the central banker could curb any sharp fall with lower interest rates.
If some delusions of this bull market recall earlier ones, the 1990's have also written fresh chapters in the annals of financial lunacy. By the market's July peak many stellar high-tech stocks traded at a staggering 70 times earnings, while investors had poured billions of dollars into Internet stocks that were largely bereft of profits. Just a week ago the stock market richly valued Yahoo! Inc. at more than $9 billion, awarding it a share price more than 300 times its projected earnings for 1998.
Most significantly, stocks came to be seen as suitable both for retirement funds and retirees. Many older Americans now live off dividends from mutual funds, as if stocks were simply turbo-charged bonds. If they sat tight for long periods, analysts told them, their stocks would outperform bonds and other traditional investments. Now many of them are trying to figure out how to survive in a world of skidding stock prices and interest rates.
Tutored to buy and hold stocks and to accumulate on dips, baby boomers in their 40's and 50's have managed to neutralize the stock market's historic fluctuations. Where the Dow had before experienced 10 percent corrections at roughly two- or three-year intervals, the market surged ahead from October 1990 to October 1997 without a single 10 percent correction. Even last October's 554-point drop was quickly erased by bullish investors, making them feel invincible.
Such investor confidence was hailed as a sign of financial maturity, and for any single investor this patient view seemed sensible. But what's right for one investor can wreak strange havoc when multiplied millions of times. The stubborn bullishness of small investors prevented the market from correcting and cleansing speculative tendencies. It further guaranteed that when the day of reckoning finally came, it would be swift and bloody.
In the end, Wall Street fell back on one last consoling myth: the oceanic flow of cash into mutual funds would buoy the market. Since 1991, $1.1 trillion has flowed into the market via this conduit. By early this year, Americans were channeling $21 billion a month into stock mutual funds. But small investors, though dogged, aren't automata, and they have now started to park money in bond or money market funds instead of stocks. The recent Wall Street bloodshed may lead them to re-evaluate the portion of their savings dedicated to stocks.
Why were so many people so blind to impending trouble? Booms tend to enlist the backing of their beneficiaries, and the longer they last, the more partisans they recruit. Brokerage houses touting stocks as safe for ordinary folk tend to play down the market's periodic treachery. Investment banks favor rising markets that accelerate the tempo of mergers and acquisitions and create the right atmosphere for public offerings of start-up companies. In a boom, it becomes hard for brokerage house analysts to broadcast their secret fears lest they seem disloyal. Our financial service companies aren't always the paragons of objectivity they pretend to be.
The nation's political leaders have largely been mute about the market's vulnerability. In December 1996 Mr. Greenspan warned of "irrational exuberance," but he didn't reprise this theme as the market grew even more irrational and exuberant. During the boom, while tens of millions of people accumulated huge paper profits, Washington officialdom, afraid of being stuck with the party-pooper label, became the silent prisoner of the bull market. The scandal-plagued Clinton team has been especially solicitous of the market, since the aura of well-being created by rising stocks has covered a multitude of sins.
While the market averages bounced back smartly yesterday in the wake of Monday's drop, the 9,337-point high of mid-July seems a distant memory. It is still unclear whether the recent turmoil represents a chastening correction or the threshold of a grim bear market. But for millions of investors newly drawn to stocks in the 1990's, it surely represents a loss of innocence.

HEADLINE: Business Travel;
Fliers are copingwith the Northwest strike, but things could get much tougher after Labor Day.

BYLINE: By Jane L. Levere 

 BODY:
THE pilots' strike at Northwest Airlines has not caused tremendous disruption so far for business travelers, since many carriers are temporarily increasing service at Northwest's primary hubs at Wayne County Metropolitan Airport in Detroit and Minneapolis/St. Paul International Airport.
However, such flying can be more expensive than usual, say some travel agency officials, who believe the other airlines are reducing availability of less expensive fares on routes where they normally compete with Northwest, as demand for seats currently often exceeds supply. 
 And although disruptions for travelers have been minimal so far, industry officials predict they could become quite severe if the strike extends into the two weeks after Labor Day, when business travel normally picks up.
Jim Faulkner, a Northwest spokesman, said the airline was trying to reschedule passengers on other carriers; he said this had been accomplished for 70 percent of Northwest's passengers so far.
To make up for the loss of Northwest's service, AMR's American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Trans World Airlines and UAL's United Airlines have increased the frequency of flights or started using larger planes from their main hub cities to either Minneapolis or Detroit.
In addition, Kiwi International Airlines began new service on Monday between Newark International Airport and Detroit. Added service out of Minneapolis is also coming from Sun Country Airlines, a privately held charter carrier whose fares are priced at least one-third lower than those of scheduled carriers, according to the airline. Sun Country has already increased its service between Minneapolis and O'Hare International Airport in Chicago and will increase flights between Detroit and Kennedy International Airport in New York.
Meanwhile, Northwest's competitors on its Asian routes, including Japan Airlines and Cathay Pacific, said they did not need to add flights or increase the size of their aircraft to accommodate Northwest's passengers, since traffic to Asia has been depressed.
Although the major United States airlines said they were not raising fares on routes where they compete with Northwest, it appears that they are trying to charge travelers the highest prices they offer. Unlike other big carriers -- which have been making full coach fares nonrefundable to avoid strike-related double booking -- United Airlines is offering a fully refundable coach fare that is approximately $50 higher than the normal full coach fare; the carrier is also offering a less expensive nonrefundable full coach fare. United officials acknowledged that they were making more of the refundable fares -- which were also sold before the Northwest strike -- available than usual.
"There's no question in my mind, when you have supply-and demand economics, and there's more demand than supply, the airlines are trying to raise their yields," said Travis Tanner, president of Carlson Wagonlit Travel, a major corporate travel company. "They're trying to take as much revenue on the plane as they can, and small travel agents and individuals are finding it almost impossible to get discounts."
Corporate travel agencies have scrambled to help clients stranded by the Northwest strike. Early last month, American Express, Carlson Wagonlit and Rosenbluth International started making alternate travel plans for customers in the event of a strike.
Although arranging alternative transportation has so far not been a big problem for most business travelers, the strike has inconvenienced many in small, often annoying, ways. Tom Polski, the Minneapolis-based vice president of public relations and communications for Carlson Hospitality Worldwide, was originally scheduled to fly Monday on Northwest to Brussels for a meeting; instead, he rescheduled the meeting and was to fly last night on Delta, via Atlanta. Mr. Polski said he felt "fortunate" that he was able to rearrange his plans relatively easily.
Sue Gilles, a Detroit-based marketing specialist for Genentech Inc., was to fly to San Francisco yesterday on American, rather than on Northwest, her carrier of choice. She would have preferred flying on United -- in whose frequent-flier program she participates, along with Northwest's -- but United's schedule did not fit her needs. She said she also had a layover in Chicago that made her trip three hours longer than usual.
Many in the travel industry predicted that prospects for business travelers could be far gloomier after the Labor Day holiday if the strike continues. Melissa Abernathy, a spokeswoman for American Express, said she expected a "spike" in business travel immediately after the holiday, while Mr. Tanner of Carlson Wagonlit predicted even greater disruption the following week, should the strike last that long.
"Next week will be softer because it will be a four-day week," he said. "The problem will come when people start trying to book for the following week."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Despite Wall Street's problems, many on Madison Avenue are upbeat about consumers.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
ADVERTISERS, agencies and the media are warily optimistic that the free-spending ways of American consumers, which have fueled more than three years of solid growth on Madison Avenue, will survive the wild gyrations on Wall Street relatively intact.
The advertising industry is notoriously sensitive to the whims of public mood because how people feel about themselves so often depends on how they feel about the economy. If shoppers are so rattled by a plunge in stock market prices that a national buyers' strike ensues in supermarkets, car showrooms and department stores, marketers may sharply pare ad spending. That would wound agencies, which were hard hit during the recession in the early 1990's. 
 Executives relaxed yesterday when the Dow Jones industrial average roared back, recovering part of the decline that had left the closely followed index, with apologies to George Bush, a thousand points lighter. Though the coming weeks may yet bring another tumble, they said they still believed that the advertising picture remained positive.
"I'm not all that surprised by the uncertainty, insecurity and turmoil," said Peter A. Georgescu, chairman and chief executive at Young & Rubicam Inc. in New York, "but I have yet to be persuaded that we're looking at something fundamentally calamitous."
"People still have their jobs," said Mr. Georgescu, whose agency creates campaigns for giant advertisers like Citicorp, the Colgate-Palmolive Company, the Ford Motor Company and the Philip Morris Companies. "I don't think they will go deep into bunkers and pull the blankets over their heads."
And the economic uncertainties, he added, may spur marketers "to place more emphasis on pushing the bottom line the old-fashioned way, by selling more stuff."
"That gives agencies a wonderful opportunity as well as a serious challenge: to make something concrete happen in the marketplace," he said.
Eugene P. Beard, vice chairman for finance and operations at the Interpublic Group of Companies in New York, echoed Mr. Georgescu.
"On a relative basis, we should be O.K.," he said of Interpublic, which owns agencies like Ammirati Puris Lintas, Lowe Group and McCann-Erickson World Group, "because I think we've been prudent enough to make sure we haven't stepped off the horizon."
"We had two or three meetings in the last month," Mr. Beard said, "to make sure that we stayed very, very focused."
"You've got to make your numbers, watch your cash flow, maintain your strong balance sheet and concentrate on what you're doing for clients and shareholders," he added. "If you do that, I think you have an opportunity."
The leading forecaster of Madison Avenue also predicted little fallout despite the Dow Jones falloff.
"There's no question that doom and gloom, and uncertainty, are not good things," said Robert J. Coen, senior vice president and forecasting director at McCann-Erickson USA, a unit of McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising in New York. "But I don't think this will net out to be much of a factor in ad spending."
Mr. Coen forecast in June that marketers would spend a record $200.3 billion to advertise this year in the United States, up 6.8 percent from $187.5 billion in 1997.
"I'll be watching closely," he said, "but I'm not making any significant modification yet in my figures."
Two industry analysts offered upbeat assessments of the future.
"Consumer confidence has proven to be a very strong leading indicator of ad spending," said William Bird, who follows the advertising and publishing industries for the Salomon Smith Barney unit of Travelers Group in New York, "and I don't see anything that would alarm me at this early juncture."
The multinational advertisers that hire such large agency companies as Y.& R., Interpublic, Omnicom Group and WPP Group P.L.C. "are spending at very healthy levels to maintain top-line growth,' he added.
"There may be unhappy people on Wall Street," he said, "but the Coca-Colas are still focused on unit growth and driving that unit growth through advertising."
Alan J. Gottesman, managing director at West End Communications/Consulting in New York, played down the preoccupation with Wall Street.
"Let's talk about the real America," he said, which "is not all that affected by this. People are still working; they're not getting fired or laid off. And more people are making more money. If some yuppie can't buy a house in the Hamptons, it won't have any impact on the advertising business."
There were, of course, some cautionary notes amid the generally sanguine mood.
"The market psychology affects spending," said David Verklin, chief executive at Carat North America in New York, a media services unit of Aegis Group P.L.C., "and clients are inherently conservative."
"The one thing left up for grabs is the fourth quarter," he added, "which accounts for at least 33 percent of annual spending. Everyone will make decisions next week and the week after about the fourth-quarter spot TV and radio markets. Will they want to spend that extra $5 million to add a schedule between Thanksgiving and Christmas?"
Bill Whitehead, chief executive for North America at Bates Worldwide in New York, part of Cordiant Communications Group P.L.C., recalled a two-week trip from which he just returned, visiting dealers who sell cars for a client, Hyundai Motor America, along with more expensive marques in sibling showrooms.
"The dealers told me they could not keep the BMW's and Mercedeses and Porsches in stock," Mr. Whitehead said. "Now the question will be whether consumers sustain that, or keep that money in their pockets."
Still, "the economy is pretty damn strong," he added, "and this is a great opportunity for advertisers to be aggressive and invest to build brand equity."
Media executives said they perceived no advertiser reticence.
"People's fourth quarter looks very strong," said Ann S. Moore, president at People magazine in New York, published by the Time Inc. unit of Time Warner Inc., "and we see no impact at this point" from the stock market's turbulent ride.
Larry Goodman, president for CNN Sales and Marketing in New York, who oversees cable networks also owned by Time Warner, said: "It has been exceptionally calm. We had no cancellations. In fact, we ended up with two mutual fund companies saying, 'Get me on the air.' "
At TV Guide magazine, said Richard G. Porter, senior vice president and publisher in New York, "so far it's business as usual."
He suggested with a chuckle that there could be a silver lining in Wall Street's woes for TV Guide, which the News Corporation is selling to United Video Satellite Group: If consumers curtail spending by forgoing restaurant meals and movies, they may stay home to -- yes, watch more television.

HEADLINE: North Korea Draws Anger With Test Of a Missile

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 1

 BODY:
Congressional leaders, already angered at reports that North Korea may be building a new underground nuclear weapons plant, responded today to the firing of a new medium-range missile across Japan on Monday with threats to cut off all food aid and other assistance to the North Koreans.
In Tokyo, the Japanese suspended aid to North Korea and put off talks on normalizing relations, officials said. 
 "They fired a shot across Japan's bow and therefore across ours too," said Senator Gordon H. Smith, Republican of Oregon, as the Senate moved to toughen the certification required of President Clinton before money can be released for a nuclear energy program given to North Korea in return for pledges not to build weapons.
The United States is now the largest donor of food to the famine-plagued North Koreans.
An American delegation has been holding talks this week in New York on nuclear issues, including the intelligence reports of a possible new weapons factory, with North Korean diplomats.
The North Koreans failed to show up for today's meeting, saying that they were awaiting new instructions from their Government. American officials said that the Korean diplomats were surprised and embarrassed by the missile test on Monday, indicating that they are far from the power loop in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital.
It was the first firing of a new class of ballistic missile, the Taepodong-1, which has now proved itself capable of hitting Japan. Japanese ships and planes were searching for the wreckage of the missile today in the Sea of Japan, 240 miles off the Noto Peninsula.
In New York, the leader of the North Korean delegation, Kim Gye Kwan, also failed to attend a scheduled meeting with Representative Benjamin A. Gilman, the New York Republican who is chairman of the House International Relations Committee. This was the second time within a week that Mr. Kim agreed to meet Mr. Gilman here but then did not appear.
Mr. Gilman, speaking at a news conference this afternoon at the United States Mission to the United Nations, said that the talks were at "a very critical juncture." He had been briefed by the American delegation leader, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Charles Kartman, but would not discuss details of the talks.
Talks with the North Koreans are always held in almost total seclusion, without any public comment by the Americans. The North Koreans are seen as a very skittish and unpredictable team, representative of the world's most secretive rulers.
"I've been supporting the ongoing talks," Mr. Gilman said, "but unless there is going to be an agreement that meets Congressional requirements, the support in the Congress will dissipate."
The North Koreans have complained that Congress is already holding up millions of dollars in disbursements of American contributions to the $6 billion energy program supported by the United States, South Korea and Japan.
Mr. Gilman said today that Congress was demanding tighter surveillance of North Korea and a higher level of cooperation from Pyongyang, where Kim Jong Il, the son of the late dictator, Kim Il Sung, is expected to be inaugurated as President next week. President Clinton is required to certify that North Korea is not violating its agreement to stop developing and exporting weapons.
Two of Mr. Gilman's aides, Mark Kirk and Peter Brookes, who just returned from a trip to North Korea to assess the food situation, issued a report today that documented the existence of "hunger prisons," where people caught foraging for food are confined.
Mr. Kirk said that the outside world is now feeding 7 million of North Korea's 22 million people -- including all children under 7, the elderly and hospital patients. He described the military as a powerful institution still able to override civilian officials. Under a Stalinist-style command economy, North Korea has all but ceased to function as an industrial or agricultural nation.
"I've supported food aid to North Korea in the past to save lives," Mr. Gilman said today. "But that kind of assistance cannot continue forever without some basic reforms in the North Korean economy."
In Washington today, Republicans were bitter in their attacks on the Clinton Administration for not freezing cooperation with North Korea.

President Clinton Lectures on Russia's Future

BYLINE: By ELEANOR RANDOLPH 

 BODY:
With markets crashing, banks shuddering and the Government imploding, Russians may not feel the urgent need for a lecture from President Clinton about economic reform. Despite the worthiness of his message about how Russia must ultimately follow "the fundamental economic imperatives of the global market" to flourish, the President's talk yesterday to young leaders in Moscow still sounded a little like the rich man giving a pep talk to the poor folk under the bridge: Yes, it's cold and gloomy down there, I know, and yes, it's painful now, but I promise it will be better in the long run.
Most Russians have been waiting a long time for the long run. During earlier decades, they endured Soviet five-year plans that dangled impossible promises of the golden Communist banquet where everyone would share more or less equally in the great national harvest. As the Soviet center fell apart in 1991, the old system gave way to a tender young democracy and an increasingly beastly form of capitalism. Many young Russians I talked with as a Moscow correspondent in those exuberant days saw a future where freedom was somehow accompanied by a BMW, as if democracy and a fat wallet would all arrive together in one lush Western package. 
 Now, faced with a reality that is increasingly painful to millions of people, Russia seems altogether too ready to decide that the Western reforms -- at least as their leaders and their shadow government of businessmen boyars practiced them -- were just another faulty experiment. "Stay the course?" said the Harriman Institute Prof. Steven Solnick of the President's advice. "To the extent they were on the course, they hate it. I think we need to steel ourselves for a long period of anti-Americanism."
Into this whirlwind comes President Clinton, suggesting grand needs for an increasingly needy country. Fair tax laws and fair enforcement, easier land transfers, intellectual property rights, independent courts, strong banks, security markets that protect investors, social spending that promotes hope and opportunity, a safety net for the dislocated and vigilance against "hidden ties between government and business interests" -- this was his list of lofty goals for a better Russia.
"This is not an American agenda," the President assured his young audience. "These are the imperatives of the global marketplace. . . ."
These imperatives, as worthy as they are, did not even lead the Russian nightly news a few hours later. The vacuum in the Kremlin, the fear of government upheaval, the weakening ruble, the stores with emptying shelves and the first day of school were more urgent topics for most Russians trying to survive far beyond the latest Presidential summit. Seven years after the end of the Soviet era, advice from a Westerner, especially an American President who acknowledges that he is not leavening it with financial aid, is hardly news.

A Straphanger Gets a Film Role
Somebody call ICM! GENE RUSSIANOFF, the earnest underdog lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign (a transportation advocacy group) and the New York Public Interest Research Group, (a government watchdog organization), has gone Hollywood. Sort of. 
 Mr. Russianoff abandoned his usual work schedule yesterday -- "gearing up to bash all the candidates for Governor for not giving New Yorkers enough subway and bus service," he said -- to tape a scene with MARK WAHLBERG for "The Yards," a Miramax film to be released next year about corruption in the commuter rail industry. The movie also stars JAMES CAAN, CHARLIZE THERON, JOAQUIN PHOENIX and FAYE DUNAWAY.
Mr. Russianoff, who has never appeared in a movie, arrived on the set -- a No.6 train at the Parkchester stop in the northern Bronx -- at 7 A.M. (Because he couldn't bear the thought of taking a car to get to the set of a movie about trains, he had to wake up at 4 o'clock to catch the subway from his home in Brooklyn.) He was to play the nonspeaking role of a snoozing subway rider. As Mr. Russianoff plopped into a seat across from Mr. Wahlberg -- whom the not-yet-ready-for-prime-time Mr. Russianoff still calls Marky Mark, by the way -- the assistant director told him to look as if he was sleeping. They had a brief spat.
"I told him no one would sleep on the subway unless you were semi-comatose," he said. "It's dangerous."
 
Former Politician Finds Employment
RUTH W. MESSINGER, whose long political career has been so closely associated with the borough of Manhattan, announced yesterday that she had accepted a job with larger boundaries: president and executive director of the American Jewish World Service, a nonprofit group that provides aid and technical advice to developing nations around the world.
Since her loss last fall to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Ms. Messinger, a former Manhattan Borough President and City Council member, has been unfamiliarly untethered to the political world. Though she has accepted teaching jobs at Hunter and Queens colleges, she said her new position is a natural outgrowth of her life's work.
"It's a wonderful opportunity to work in the field of social justice, which is what I believe my political and professional career has been about," she said. The 13-year-old group, based in Manhattan, provides volunteers and assistance to countries in need of aid in health, economic development, agriculture and education, as well as disaster relief.
 
Motherly Concerns
With things falling off buildings all around town, some mothers are worried. One of them is MADONNA.
In an affidavit filed in State Supreme Court on Monday, Madonna joined a lawsuit intended to stop the Y.M.C.A. on West 63d Street from building a 41-story residential tower near her apartment building on Central Park West, The Associated Press reported.
The proposed construction, according to the filing, would create a "hazard for me and my child."
Madonna, who identifies herself in the affidavit as a professional entertainer and a mother, is one of several Upper West Side mothers to file affidavits in the case, said Kevan Cleary, a spokesman for the coalition of West Side groups that filed the lawsuit on Aug. 16. The defendants include the Y and the Buildings Department.
The affidavit cited the July 21 incident in which scaffolding gave way on the north side of the 48-story Conde Nast building on 43d Street.
Elise Fink, a spokeswoman for the Department of Buildings, said the department had been working to insure the site's safety and had met with community leaders, contractors and representatives of the Y.M.C.A. ALEX KUCZYNSKI with David Firestone

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN MOSCOW: THE SCENE;
Summit Meeting Teeters On Edge of Self-Parody

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Sept. 1

 BODY:
As President and Mrs. Clinton prepared to retire tonight at the Marriott Hotel near the banks of the Moscow River, a car pulled over not far from the hotel entrance. The doors opened, and Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the ultranationalist who controls a bloc of seats in Russia's Parliament, climbed out.
Mr. Zhirinovsky turned toward the hotel and yelled, in so many exceptionally unprintable words, "Clinton, you are an idiot!" After applying the coarsest description of sexual relations to the President, he added, "Your dollar is dirt, and this dirt is all over the world!" 
 He then produced a dollar in his hand and told his supporters, "Burn it." They did.
This evening, Moscow television broadcast videotape of the event in its entirety, barely-bleeped epithets and all.
This sort of disgrace would never have happened if Leonid Brezhnev still ran things. But Brezhnev and the Soviet Union are dead, Boris N. Yeltsin is alive and, by several accounts still kicking, and Russian-American summitry -- still somber and inflated as ever -- now teeters at times on the slippery brink of self-parody.
Depending on one's point of view, Moscow right now is either no place for such a worldly event or the perfect place. The contrast between former summit meetings and the current state of the two countries -- and their leaders -- is simply too great to ignore.
The public aspects of this summit meeting have been scripted almost entirely for television; some events, such as a wreath-laying in Red Square this morning, were staged solely for cameras and a small pool of reporters.
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Yeltsin dutifully mugged for the cameras all day, exchanging bear hugs, gifts and tributes to the enduring friendship of their nations at almost every public opportunity.
Mr. Yeltsin, looking reasonably hale, good-naturedly stiffed news photographers by turning his back on them during one ceremony.
Mr. Clinton, ever gregarious, practiced staff-written Russian-language platitudes on crowds all day. Beyond the range of the lens, however, the economy is unavoidable.
As the Clintons and the Yeltsins and some 115 other luminaries dined in the Kremlin tonight on pike rasstegai, salmon, roast-beef-stuffed omelet and the obligatory wine and caviar, Muscovites a few blocks away were resting after a day of methodically picking grocery shelves clean of food and dry goods they fully expect will soon disappear.
Moscow newspapers reported today that ships loaded with imported goods, now a huge share of Russian purchases, were turning away or refusing to unload because of the fiscal uncertainty. Non-perishables like grain, oils and, in St. Petersburg, refrigerators were vanishing from stores, and prices in some instances had reportedly doubled.
Olympic-quality runners, fearful of being injured in a coup, threatened to desert a world-class track meet this weekend. The Russian Olympic Committee was hampered in responding because its electricity had been turned off for nonpayment.
And that was merely the Russian side of the equation. Moments after Mr. Clinton finished cutting a fat loaf of Russian bread this morning in Mr. Yeltsin's marble-and-bronze Kremlin study, the two men were jerked back to reality by a CBS News correspondent who suddenly asked: What about the economy?
The correspondent, Scott Pelley, was seeking a response from Mr. Clinton about Monday's 500-point drop in the stock market. But the question could just as easily have been asked of Mr. Yeltsin, whose nation's own stock market has shed 60 percent of its blue-chips' value in the last two months alone.
Mr. Pelley was escorted from the room by Russian officials and briefly stripped of his press credentials for breaking a promise to be silent.
As Mr. Zhirinovsky demonstrated, the respect usually accorded to summit participants has gone largely by the boards this week.
Mrs. Clinton played a decided second today to Naina Yeltsin as the two toured a factory, and Mrs. Yeltsin decried the lack of women's roles in business. Mrs. Clinton was even asked point-blank about her outlook in the wake of the President's admission that he carried on a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
"I've been getting along fine," Mrs. Clinton responded; reporters later analyzed her body language and facial expressions during a joint appearance with Mr. Clinton -- their first since his admission -- at a Russian public school. Mr. Clinton also suffered his share of slings. In downtown Moscow, a British manager of a fine-arts reproduction company was selling a special edition of Russian nesting dolls, featuring the likenesses of Mr. Clinton, Ms. Lewinsky and three other women with whom he has been said to have had -- or tried to have -- some involvement.
The manager, David Segal, said the $35 dolls "are being produced as fast as the people can get the stock for them."
Mr. Segal said he was merely doing his part for the Russian economy. "We're going to have most of one village turning them out," he said in an interview this week.

HEADLINE: Airline and Pilots to Weigh New Talks

BYLINE: The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 1

 BODY:
The heads of Northwest Airlines and its striking pilots union met for almost five hours today with the Transportation Secretary but agreed only to consider returning to the bargaining table.
The Secretary, Rodney E. Slater, said that the Clinton Administration would not order the pilots, on strike for four days, back to work, at least not for now. "It remains the President's view that it is up to the parties to reach agreement without Federal intervention at this time," he said. 
 Mr. Clinton has the power to order the pilots back to work for a 60-day cooling-off period, but so far has been reluctant to do so.
Mr. Slater met with John H. Dasburg, chief executive of Northwest; Richard B. Hirst, another executive; J. Randolph Babbitt, president of the Air Line Pilots Association, and Steven Zoller, chairman of the Northwest pilots' union.
The meeting with the Transportation Secretary came after Northwest announced that it had laid off 177 workers and said many of its 50,000 employees could follow.
A company spokeswoman said 162 dispatchers and 15 meteorologists would be laid off. Northwest deferred a decision on its other employees until Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Rebound on Wall Street

 BODY:
The American stock market bounced back yesterday, encouraging investors around the world and reducing the pressure on central bankers to lower interest rates here and in Europe. Perhaps markets will now pause to see just how far Asia's economic woes will spread.
Until this summer, most investors had been willing to act as if the American economy would continue to hum along, despite growing problems that have plunged most of Asia into recession. Now many think it will be difficult for the world's leading economies to avoid slowing. "It is only a question of time," warned Neal M. Soss, the chief United States economist for Credit Suisse First Boston, "before even the mighty U.S. economy catches cold." 
 That said, the evidence of illness in this country is so far limited. There are signs that banks are less willing to lend than they had been, and manufacturers are seeing a slowing of orders. But American consumers have continued to spend, and overall economic activity has not fallen off a cliff.
That economic strength was cited by some analysts yesterday as evidence that American stocks had fallen too far, and those arguments helped the market recover. But an irony of the current situation is that the apparent health of the American economy may end up hurting the world. That is because the Federal Reserve is charged by law with focusing on the United States' economy, with the rest of the world a secondary priority. Yet what is happening is that much of the world is being starved of capital as investors who only recently were all too eager to invest in emerging markets are now fleeing those markets. Central banks in those countries have raised interest rates in a futile attempt to bring capital back, only to see the high rates further depress the local economy.
As Robert J. Barbera, the chief economist for Hoenig & Company, said this week, "a global central bank would drive interest rates sharply lower in response to these obvious deflationary forces." But there is no such bank. The closest thing available would be concerted action by the Federal Reserve and the major European central banks. Calmer markets make that less likely.
One Asian country, Malaysia, took matters into its own hands yesterday by announcing stringent capital controls -- hoping to stabilize the value of Malaysia's currency while allowing local interest rates to fall and stimulating local business activity. Such a move, however, will make foreign investment even less likely, and runs the risk of encouraging corruption since it will be up to the Government to decide which people, or companies, can move their money out of the country. But it is an understandable move in the current situation, and only serves to heighten the need for international action to get the world growing again.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Treasuries Register Sharpest Loss in More Than 4 Months

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
With the stock market having rebounded from Monday's decline, Treasury securities posted their sharpest loss in more than four months yesterday. Volume was heavy, as flows of capital from equity markets into United States Government debt eased.
The yield of the 30-year Treasury bond -- the benchmark for various loans -- moved sharply higher, to 5.34 percent from 5.25 percent on Monday. And the price, which moves in the opposite direction, fell 1 17/32 to 102 17/32, or about $15 for each $1,000 of bonds in the hands of investors. 
 While the decline in bonds was coupled to the rise in stocks, a falling dollar in world currency trading also weighed on the market. A weak dollar makes dollar-denominated investments like Treasuries more attractive to foreign investors because of the potential gains they could make in currency translation.
Donald Fine, the chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said the National Association of Purchasing Management index for August, which was released yesterday, was down slightly, to 49.4. But more important, he said, it was under 50 for the third consecutive month. A reading below 50 implies contraction in the industrial sector.
By late in the day the yield on a 10-year note was 5.05 percent and a two-year note was 4.86 percent. Including the 30-year bond, all the rates were below the 5.5 percent Federal Reserve target for the Federal funds rate, a situation known as an inverted yield curve.
"It is the first sign of a recession at some point in the horizon," Mr. Fine said. "But given the incredibly strong economic base, it could be 18 months or so before we feel the effects. It's not in the economic numbers yet, but the inverted yield is probably the earliest leading indicator of economic duress. And while recessions do not last as long as expansions, for many it feels like forever."
Mr. Fine said that he believed the current yield curve suggested a monetary easing of 50 to 75 basis points. "However," he added, "it may be a few months before the central bank decides to act. Certainly if the stock market plummets further it may act sooner." A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Since last month's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, market events have made the Fed's bias toward tightening an anachronism, Mr. Fine said.
"It is now likely that, in the minds of the F.O.M.C. members, their bias has been removed in favor of a neutral stance," he said. "However, the Fed will be reluctant to ease until there are definitive signs of a sustainable slowdown in both consumption and housing. These signs should appear fairly soon, and thus also point to the next Fed move as being an ease, but this might not occur for a few months."

HEADLINE: WORLD ECONOMIES: THE LENDER;
Russian Woes Increase Doubts Over U.S. Money for I.M.F.

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 1

 BODY:
The current economic turbulence has widened the gulf dividing Republicans over whether to approve new financing for the International Monetary Fund.
Congress appeared certain to increase the American contribution to the monetary fund when lawmakers left on a monthlong recess in August. But with the Senate having resumed business this week, and the House due back next week, the new financing is now teetering on the brink with each day's gloomy news. 
 Critics led by Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader, say the fresh financial turmoil in Russia underscores their belief that replenishing the fund's reserves now would only throw good money after bad.
"The evidence is now undeniable that the I.M.F. has played a destabilizing role in world financial affairs," Mr. Armey said in a letter to House members today. "Russia simply took the I.M.F.'s latest $4.8 billion loan installment and threw it into the currency markets, where it was instantly vaporized."
But the fund's supporters argue that the current crisis is proof that the United States cannot be shielded from other countries' problems and that Congress must act quickly to approve the Administration's $18 billion request to avert even greater financial woes.
"It's a symbol as much as anything else that the world community will try to contain the meltdown of the international monetary system," Senator Ted Stevens, the Alaska Republican who heads the Appropriations Committee, said in an interview today.
These divergent views illustrate the split among Republicans, particularly in the House, between market purists who criticize the fund's secretive practices and internationalists who say the fund is essential to help maintain stability in the increasingly global economy.
"Markets respond to confidence, and the I.M.F. is one of those confidence builders," said Senator Chuck Hagel, a Nebraska Republican.
Indeed, that is an argument that Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, have been making on Capitol Hill for months. It is a theme that has been hammered home by business groups and by farmers, who are watching their exports to Asia dwindle or disappear.
Why would Republicans, traditionally the party of big business, block something that Wall Street would embrace? Mainly because the popular notion that the Republican Party and Wall Street walk in lockstep has been steadily eroding since Republicans like Senator Arthur Vandenberg led the party away from isolationism after World War II.
"There's a very uneasy relation between U.S. corporate interests and the G.O.P. majority, particularly in the House," said Edmund B. Rice, executive director of the Coalition for Employment Through Exports, a business group that supports new financing for the monetary fund.
"They are more grounded in small-town, rural, religious, political interests," Mr. Rice said of the House Republicans. "They're much more focused on domestic issues and suspicious of international involvement and certainly of large U.S. corporations."
The more internationally minded Senate overwhelmingly approved the full $18 billion months ago and was expected to reaffirm that vote this week. But the House leadership has balked. The House seemed prepared to follow the Senate in late July, when Mr. Armey conceded that the fund's supporters probably had the votes. But his apparent acquiescence upset House conservatives, and Mr. Armey quickly reversed himself and vowed to fight on.
The about-face also grew out of the political battle over the House leadership between Mr. Armey and Representative Robert L. Livingston of Louisiana, who heads the House Appropriations Committee. Both men want to be Speaker if Newt Gingrich steps down to run for President in 2000 and have been trying to curry favor among House Republicans.
Mr. Armey counts among his strongest supporters the House's most conservative members. Mr. Livingston, who supports the fund, has been looking to business groups, who favor more money for it, for support. But the events in Russia may be giving Mr. Livingston pause.
Whether the public cares is unclear. Even as the American stock market plunges, fueled in part by the uncertainty in Moscow, lawmakers say there is no public pressure to shore up the monetary fund.
Representative Jim Kolbe, an Arizona Republican and I.M.F. supporter, said today from Tucson, "It's not exactly a burning issue with most people."

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN MOSCOW: THE ACCORDS;
U.S. to Use Its Missile Warning System to Alert Russians to Launchings Worldwide

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Sept. 1

 BODY:
During the frigid days of the cold war, American satellites watched for the fiery launchings of Soviet missiles, a sign that the United States might soon be under nuclear attack.
Now that the nuclear standoff is over, the United States has found a new use for its warning systems. It plans to employ them to alert the Russians about missile launchings around the world. 
 On Wednesday, President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin plan to sign a new accord under which the United States and Russia will instantly share data about the launching of ballistic missiles and space payloads.
With Russia's economy deteriorating by the day and the Yeltsin Government in political crisis, arms control no longer holds center stage.
The idea of using American military technology to help the Russians plug the gaps in their early warning system recalls Ronald Reagan's heady dreams of a world in which the United States and the Russians would team up to develop "Star Wars" antimissile systems.
The objectives of the new accord, of course, are not nearly as grand, though they are still important.
With the collapse of the Soviet Union, Washington has become increasingly worried that Russia's warning system is so frayed that Moscow might misinterpret the data and conclude mistakenly that it is under attack. The result could be an accidental nuclear war.
It is not an abstract concern. For a few tense moments, the Russian military misread its data about the 1995 launching of a Norwegian scientific rocket as a possible submarine missile attack.
"The agreement provides further protection against an inadvertent nuclear exchange triggered by misidentification of a launch," said Robert G. Bell, a senior aide on the National Security Council.
The surprise test-firing of a North Korean missile over Japanese territory on Monday underscored the potential of launchings to unnerve neighboring nations.
Certainly, the Russian early warning system has many deficiencies. The Government's cash crunch has forced Russia to limit the deployment of warning satellites. Some ground-based radars are in poor repair. Others ended up on the wrong side of the border after the Soviet Union collapsed.
The Russian radar station at Skrunde, Latvia, was closed on Monday. The Baltic state had initially allowed the radar station to operate after the collapse of the Soviet Union, but finally concluded that it no longer wanted to serve as a Russian military outpost.
Col. Gen. Vladimir Yakovlev, commander of Russia's strategic rocket forces, said closing the Skrunde station would put a serious strain on Russia's warning network. Eventually, the military hopes to build a replacement station in nearby Belarus.
However limited their data, the Russians would also provide it to the United States under the new agreement.
The missile data accord was not the only measure intended to cope with the new dangers that have arisen since the cold war. The two sides also plan to sign an agreement on Wednesday calling for the disposal of weapons-grade plutonium.
Under the agreement, Russia and the United States would each remove 50 tons of plutonium from military stockpiles and dispose of it by using it as fuel in nuclear reactors or mixing it with waste.
Most of the details have yet to be negotiated, including the pressing question of how to pay for the Russian program to use the plutonium as reactor fuel.
An American official said the program could take more than five years -- an estimate some observers regard as optimistic. Even so, 50 tons represents only a quarter of Russia's estimated plutonium supply.
Still, American officials say the accord enshrines an important idea: Plutonium is not a resource to be husbanded, as the Russian nuclear establishment often argues, but a danger.
It is the missile-data agreement, though, that is the closest to being put into action. American officials said they hoped the system would be operational in a year or two.
This is how it would work. The United States receives data about missile launchings from two sources: Early warning satellites that detect the heat from missile launchings, and powerful radars in Greenland, Britain, Alaska and along the American coasts that track the missiles.
That data is synthesized at military processing centers and transmitted to the Pentagon, American military commanders and allies.
The new accord would add a new recipient: the Russians. The missile information could be transmitted directly to a Russian command post, like the Center for Space and Military Situations near Moscow.
Or a joint American-Russian command center might be established and the data sent there. That would enable the two sides to discuss the information and provide another check against misunderstanding.
If Norway launched another scientific rocket, for example, the Americans would provide data on the origin and time of the launching, its trajectory and moment of expected impact. There would be no more tense moments when Russian commanders struggled to figure out if the launching was hostile or benign.
American launchings would be included in the data dispatched to the Russians. But the United States will probably withhold information on Russia's own missile launchings.
The concern is that the Russians might launch missiles and then use the American data they receive to determine the limits and vulnerabilities of the American warning system. Even as the United States seeks to broaden its cooperation with the Russians, the military rivalry lingers on. To supplement the system, the United States is calling for a new international arrangement in which nations would provide advance notice of their missile launchings.
Bruce Blair, an expert on nuclear command and control systems at the Washington-based Brookings Institution, said the accord would help Moscow and Washington better understand the spread of missile technology in the third world.
"It is a good idea on several levels," Mr. Blair said. "It would alleviate coverage gaps and false alarms that could be a source of trouble."

Concern that blind spots in Russia's missile warning systems might contribute to an accidental nuclear attack has led the U.S. to conclude an agreement with Russia to share data from early warning systems. The final details are still being worked out, but here is how that system could work.

HEADLINE: Zedillo Tells Mexico Painful Economic Policies Are Farsighted

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Sept. 1

 BODY:
President Ernesto Zedillo tonight made his first major statement about the effects of the world financial crisis on Mexico. Mr. Zedillo acknowledged that plunging oil prices had forced painful budget cuts and urging Mexicans to be patient and work hard to help the country continue to grow.
"I must be the first to warn that the circumstances in which our economy will operate in the near future will be difficult," Mr. Zedillo said in his annual state of the union address. But Mexico can expect to average 4 percent growth for the two years that remain in his six-year term, he said, "as long as we keep our spirits high and work hard." 
 In an hourlong speech that defended his Government's efforts to solve everything from surging crime to illiteracy, Mr. Zedillo devoted the most time to explaining his often-painful economic policies, arguing that they had so far helped Mexico to bend, but not break, with the global financial pressures.
The extraordinary recent losses in the Mexican financial markets after Russia's de facto devaluation of the ruble surrounded Mr. Zedillo's report to Congress with an air of crisis.
Politicians and analysts of all stripes delivered their own assorted report cards on the President's performance in his four years in office.
"A quick look at the economic indicators reveal that our country is sustaining itself on the pillars of deceit and the people's poverty," Senator Gabriel Jimenez Remus of the opposition National Action Party told the Congress hours before Mr. Zedillo's address. "Falling per capita income, rising inflation, the devaluation of our currency, ever rising unemployment -- all are shoving our country toward the third world."
"Fifth Year Begins in Financial Crisis" was the headline today in the newspaper Reforma. The paper featured a poll that showed that 51 percent of Mexicans approved Mr. Zedillo's Presidency, down from 60 percent in December.
"Zedillo's approval ratings have begun to decline," the newspaper reported, "and the President's fall has been caused by the poor pace of the economy."
Even so, Mr. Zedillo is more popular than the opposition Mayor of Mexico City, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, and about half the 31 state governors.
The 1994 peso devaluation, during Mr. Zedillo's first month in office, provoked a worldwide financial crisis and plunged Mexico into recession. But the tight-money policies and fiscal discipline that he imposed after that brought the broad economic indicators back to healthy growth in two years.
The new economic turbulence, originating in Asia, has been washing over Mexico since July, when plunging world oil prices forced Mr. Zedillo to preside over the third severe budget cut this year. Soon the peso, which opened the year worth 12.4 American cents, began to slide. At the close of trading on Monday the peso was worth 10.03 cents.
Interest rates have climbed, to 38 percent in the secondary markets.
Mexican markets were closed today for a national holiday, the Day of the Presidential Report.
"People are saying that the President is weakened," Sergio Sarmiento, news director of the TV Azteca network, wrote in a newspaper column. "They say, with a certain degree of truth, that the international financial crisis is eroding the only point about which Zedillo could claim success, his handling of the macroeconomy.
"Everything else seems to be in disaster. But this isn't the first time Mr. Zedillo has been portrayed erroneously as defeated."

Europe and the United States today shunted aside a call from Japan for an emergency meeting of the world's largest economies to deal with Russia's economic crisis.
At the same time, leaders in several nations cast about for a fresh strategy to contain virulent outbreaks of economic instability. 
 Japan's new Prime Minister, Keizo Obuchi, asked for the meeting in a telephone call on Monday to Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain. But by the end of the day today it had been dismissed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who is fighting for political survival in a close German election campaign and is distancing himself from years of heavy financial support for Russia.
American officials also rejected the Japanese proposal, with some officials saying it would be counterproductive to gather financial leaders when no one agrees on how to remedy the global economic contagion, whose causes and cures appear more elusive every day.
"At the moment there is a vacuum in policy," said Allen Sinai, the chief global economist of Primark Decision Economics, an economic strategy advisory group. "No one has any good ideas. At the moment, one cannot see any real turnaround in Asia, Japan is getting sicker and Russia was a throw-away of money."
"The G-7 countries," he said, referring to the Group of Seven nations, which historically have taken the lead in global economic troubles, "are at a loss for what to do."
Senior Administration officials insist that they are batting around ideas in urgent calls with finance ministers and political leaders around the world, but they were loath to discuss them publicly.
The problem is complicated by vastly differing political agendas: Japan, Germany and the United States are consumed by domestic political events that have given their leaders precious little maneuvering room in one of the most complicated economic environments since the end of World War II.
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, who declared on Monday that "the world is currently working its way through a difficult period," stayed out of sight today, but he released a letter to leaders of both parties urging immediate Congressional approval of new financing for the International Monetary Fund.
"Events over the last eight months," Mr. Rubin wrote, "underscore the impact on the U.S. economy of developments abroad, including in Asia and Russia. We simply cannot afford any further delay in providing the I.M.F. with the resources it requires to help contain the threat of further financial and political instability around the world."
The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, was in California on vacation. On Friday he and Mr. Rubin are to meet with Japan's Finance Minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, in San Francisco, where they are expected to increase the pressure for immediate action by Japan to clean up its banking system and spur its economy. In recent weeks, hopes that the new Japanese Government would prove more energetic than the previous one have faded.
"A bigger meltdown in Japan is our biggest single nightmare, at a time when we have plenty of nightmares," a senior Administration official said over the weekend.
Some American officials suggested that Prime Minister Obuchi asked for a Group of 7 meeting to divert attention from Japan's problems. If so, it would be a difficult trick: Japan's investors are more focused on the numbing parliamentary debate over banking reform than they are about whether Russia will be able to pay its military.
But Japan is hardly the only country suffering domestic paralysis.
While Mr. Rubin has repeatedly called for $18 billion in new funds for the I.M.F., President Clinton has discussed the subject only in passing. Administration officials insist that the President is fully committed to the proposal, arguing that the timing is simply not yet right to begin twisting arms on Capitol Hill. Other Democrats, however, say the fight over financing may be the first test of whether Mr. Clinton's powers of persuasion have diminished since his admission of an inappropriate relationship with a White House intern.
Chancellor Kohl is performing his own political pirouette.
On the campaign trail this week, Mr. Kohl defended the West's strategy of giving Russia billions of dollars in aid in an effort to turn it into a market economy.
"From a German perspective, there was no alternative," he said, a reference to both Germany's security concerns and the billions of dollars that German financial institutions loaned to their Russian counterparts, much of which is now at risk. "It was in our elementary interest that Russia finds its way."
"I never said this will be a policy without setbacks," he added.
But it was Mr. Kohl who led the movement among European nations to delay aid to Russia after its effective devaluation of the ruble two weeks ago. Stanley Fischer, the No. 2 I.M.F. official, has said this delay greatly worsened Russia's problems.
Nonetheless, in cellphone calls from vacation retreats and E-mail letters among central bankers, ideas are being discussed on how to calm the world's financial anxieties.
The most common notion is to coordinate the lowering of interest rates around the world in hopes of stimulating growth. But Japan's interest rates are already at historic lows -- around 1 percent -- and companies there complain that no bank will lend them money at any price. The only advantage of a further cut would be to signal that the Government is interested in encouraging a modest amount of inflation, in the hope that it would initiate spending by consumers.
Another experiment being discussed by several nations -- but opposed by Washington -- is to control the exchange of international currencies in the hope of preventing damaging speculation.
But such a move would violate President Clinton's repeated calls for countries to embrace open markets, an appeal he renewed today in Moscow. "No nation, rich or poor, democratic or authoritarian, can escape the fundamental economic imperatives of the global market," he insisted in a speech at a Moscow university.
Some, however, are trying. Malaysia made a complete break with the strategy of open markets today when Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad announced sweeping controls that effectively prevent investors from converting their holdings in Malaysia into other currencies, including dollars. The announcement immediately set off a run for the exits: Prices on the Kuala Lumpur stock market fell 13.3 percent, the biggest decline in more than a decade.
American officials are worried that if Mr. Mahathir's experiment in cutting his economy off from investors around the world proves even briefly successful, it could be copied in other nations, all of whom are looking for a way to prevent a huge outflow of the foreign money that has given markets enormous power over the policy of governments.
Thailand and South Korea probably could not attempt such a move while under the I.M.F.'s tutelage. But Hong Kong's leaders have discussed the issue with American officials.

Excerpts From Clinton's Remarks: 'You Have to Play by the Rules'

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from remarks by President Clinton yesterday at Moscow State University, as recorded by Federal News Service, a private transcription company:
 We Americans have fought and argued with each other, as we do even today. But we have preserved our freedom by remembering the fundamental values enshrined in our Constitution and our Declaration of Independence, by continuing to respect the dignity of every man, woman and child, to tolerate those with different ideas and beliefs than our own, to demand equality of opportunity, to give everyone a chance to make the most of his or her life. 
 Russia's great ally in World War II, our President, Franklin Roosevelt, said that democracy is a never-ending seeking for better things. For Americans, that means, in good times and bad, we seek to widen the circle of opportunity, to deepen the meaning of our freedom, to build a stronger national community.
Now, what has all that got to do with Russia in 1998? Your history is much longer than ours and so rich with accomplishment, from military victories over Napoleon and Hitler to the literary achievements of Pushkin, Tolstoy, Chekhov, Pasternak and so many others, to great achievements in art, music, dance, medicine, science . . . .
Yet for all your rich, long history, it was just seven years ago that Russia embarked on its own quest for democracy. . . .
Now you are at a critical point on your journey. There are severe economic pressures and serious hardships which I discussed in my meetings with your leaders this morning. The stakes are enormous. Every choice Russia makes today may have consequences for years and years to come.
Given the facts before you, I have to tell you that I do not believe there are any painless solutions. And indeed, an attempt to avoid difficult solutions may only prolong and worsen the present challenges.
First, let me make a couple of points. The experience of our country over the last several years, and especially in the last six years, proves that the challenges of the global economy are very great, but so are its rewards. The Russian people have met tremendous challenges in the past. You can do it here. You can build a prosperous future. You can build opportunity and jobs for all the people of this land who are willing to work for them if you stand strong and complete -- not run from but complete the transformation you began seven years ago.
 
Global Markets
The second point I want to make is the rest of the world has a very large stake in your success. Today, about a quarter of the world's people are struggling with economic challenges that are profound -- the people of your country, the people in Japan who have had no economic growth for five years. It's still a very wealthy country, but when they don't have any growth, it's harder for all other countries to trade with them who aren't so wealthy -- to grow -- other countries in Asia. And now we see, when there are problems in Russia or in Japan or questions about the economy of China, you see all across the world -- the stock market in Latin America drops. You see the last two days we've had big drops in the American stock market.
What does that say? Well, among other things, it says, whether we like it or not, we must build the future together because, whether we like it or not, we are going to be affected by what we do. We will be affected by what you do, and you will be affected by what we do. We might as well do it together and make the most of it.
Now, in terms of what has happened in America, obviously it's always more enjoyable when our stock market goes up than when it goes down. But I have talked to our Secretary of the Treasury about this several times since yesterday. I want to reiterate the point that I think is important for Russia, for America, for every country. We believe our fundamental economic policy is sound. We believe our people are working at record rates. And we are determined to stay on a path of fiscal discipline that brought us to where we are.
I think that wherever there are markets, there will always be changes in those markets. But we must attempt to move in the right direction. And that's what I want to talk to you about today. How can we move in the right direction?
When I look at all the young people here today -- and I have read about you and your background, young people from all over Russia seizing the possibilities of freedom to chart new courses for yourselves and your nation, making a difference by building businesses from modest loans and innovative ideas, by taking technologies created for weapons and applying them to human needs, by finding creative government solutions to complex problems, by improving medical care and fighting disease, by publishing courageous journalism, exposing abuses of power, producing literature and art and scholarship, changing the way people see their own lives, organizing citizens to fight for justice and human rights and a cleaner environment, reaching out to the world.
In this room today, there are young people doing all those things. That should give you great reason for hope. You are at the forefront of building a modern Russia. You are a new generation. You do represent the future of your dreams. Your efforts today will not only insure better lives for yourselves, but for your children and generations that follow.
I think it is important to point out, too, that when Russia chose freedom, it was not supposed to benefit only the young and well educated, the rich and well connected. It was also supposed to benefit the men and women who work in factories and farms and fought the wars of the Soviet era, those who survive today on pensions and government assistance. It was also supposed to benefit the laborers and teachers and soldiers who work every day but wait now for paychecks.
The challenge is to create a new Russia that benefits all responsible citizens of this country. How do you get there? I do not believe it is by reverting to the failed policies of the past. I do not believe it is by stopping the reform process in midstream, with a few Russians doing very well but far more struggling to provide for their families. I believe you will create the conditions of growth if, but only if, you continue to move decisively along the path of democratic, market-oriented, constructive revolution.
The Russian people have made extraordinary progress in the last seven years. You have gone to the polls to elect your leaders. Some 65 to 70 percent of you freely turn out in every election. People across Russia are rebuilding diverse religious traditions, launching a wide range of private organizations. Seventy percent of the economy now is in private hands. Not bureaucrats but consumers determine what goods get to stores and where people live. You have reached out to the world with trade and investment, exchanges of every kind, and leadership in meeting security challenges around the globe.
Now you face a critical moment. Today's financial crisis does not require you to abandon your march toward freedom and free markets. Russians will define Russia's future, but there are clear lessons, I would argue, from international experience. Here's what I think they are.
First, in tough times, governments need stable revenues to pay their bills, support salaries, pensions and health care. That requires decisive action to insure that everyone pays their fair share of taxes. Otherwise a few pay too much, many pay too little, the Government's in the hole and can never get out, and you will never be able to have a stable economic policy.
It is tempting for everyone to avoid wanting to pay any taxes. But if everyone will pay their fair share, the share will be modest and their incomes will be larger over the long run because of the stability and growth it will bring to this Russian economic system.
 
Lessons of Experience
Second, printing money to pay the bills and bail out the banks does not help. It causes inflation and ultimately will make the pain worse.
Third, special bailouts for a privileged few come at the expense of the whole nation.
Fourth, fair, equitable treatment of creditors today will determine their involvement in the nation tomorrow. The people who loan money into this nation must be treated fairly if you want them to be loaning money into this nation 4 years, 5 years, 10 years hence.
These are not radical theories. These are simple facts proven by experience. How Russia reacts to them will fundamentally affect your future. Surviving today's crisis, however difficult that may be, is just the beginning. To create jobs, growth and higher income, a nation must convince its own citizens and foreigners that they can safely invest.
Again, experience teaches what works: Fair tax laws and fair enforcement; easier transferability of land; strong intellectual property rights to encourage innovation; independent courts enforcing the law consistently and upholding contract rights; strong banks that safeguard savings; securities markets that protect investors; social spending that promotes hope and opportunity and a safety net for those who, in any given time in an open-market economy, will be dislocated, and vigilance against hidden ties between government and business interests that are inappropriate.
Now, this is not an American agenda. I will say it again. This is not an American agenda. These are the imperatives of the global marketplace, and you can see them repeated over and over and over again. You can also see the cost of ignoring them in nation after nation after nation.
Increasingly, no nation, rich or poor, democratic or authoritarian, can escape the fundamental economic imperatives of the global market. Investors and entrepreneurs have a very wide and growing range of choices about where they put their money. They move in the direction of openness, fairness and freedom.
Here Russia has an opportunity. At the dawn of the new century, there is a remarkable convergence. Increasingly, the very policies that are needed to thrive in the new economy are also those which deepen democratic liberty for individual citizens.
This is a wealthy country. It is rich in resources. It is richer still in people. It has done a remarkable job of providing quality education to large numbers of people. You have proven over and over and over again, in ways large and small, that the people of this country have a sense of courage and spirit, an unwillingness to be beat down and to give up. The future can be very, very bright.
But we can't ignore the rules of the game, because if there is a system of freedom, you cannot take away and no country -- not even the United States, with the size of our economy -- no country is strong enough to control what millions and millions and millions of people decide freely to do with their money.
 
A Future of Ideas
But every country will keep a large share of its own citizens' money and get a lot of money from worldwide investors if it can put in place systems that abide by the rules of international commerce. And all Russia needs is its fair share of this investment. You have the natural wealth. You have the people power. You have the education. All you need is just to get your fair share of the investment.
Now, 21st-century economic power will rest on creativity and innovation. I believe the young people in this room think they can be as creative or innovative as anyone in the world. It will rest on the free flow of information. It will rest on ideas.
Consider this, those of you who are beginning your careers. America's three largest computer and software companies are now worth more than all the American companies in our steel, automotive, aerospace, chemical and plastics industries combined -- combined: our three biggest computer companies.
The future is a future of ideas. No nation will ever have a monopoly on ideas. No people will ever control all the creative juices that flow in the human spirit more or less evenly across the world. You will do very well if you just get your fair share of investment. To get your fair share of investment, you have to play by the rules that everyone else has to play by.
That's what this whole crisis is about. No one could ever have expected your country to be able to make this transition without pain. You've only been at this seven years. Look at any European country that has had an open-market society for decades and decades and decades. They have hundreds, indeed thousands, of little organizations. They have major national institutions that all tend to reinforce these rules that I talked about earlier. Don't be discouraged, but don't be deterred. Just keep working until you get it in place. Once you get it in place, Russia will take off like a rocket, because you have both natural resources and people resources.
Now, I think it's important to point out, however, that economic strength -- let's go back to the rules; it depends on the rule of law. If somebody from outside a country intends to put money into a foreign country, they want to know what the rules are. What are the terms on which my money is being invested? How will my investment be protected? If I lose money, I want to know it's because I made a bad decision, not because the law didn't protect my money. It is very important.
Investors, therefore, seek honest governments, fair systems, fair for corporations and consumers, where there are strong checks on corruption and abuse of authority and openness in what the rules are on how investment capital is handled. Economic strength depends on equality of opportunity. There must be strong schools and good health care, and everyone must have a chance to share in the nation's bounty. And economic power must lie with people who vote their consciences, use new technologies to spread ideas, start organizations to work for change and build enterprises of all kinds.
Now, some seek to exploit this power shift that's going on in the world to take advantage of their fellow citizens. When this nation went from the old communist command-and-control system to an open, free system without all the intermediate institutions and private organizations that it takes years to build up, vacuums were created. And into those vacuums, some moved with an intent to exploit their fellow citizens, to enrich themselves without regard to fairness or safety or the future.
The challenges for any citizen -- this is not Russia-specific -- this would have happened and has happened in every single country that has had to make this transition. There's nothing inherently negative about this development. It is as predictable as the sun coming up in the morning. Every country has had to face this. But you must overcome it.
You must have a state that is strong enough to control abuses -- violence, theft, fraud, bribery, monopolism. But it must not be so strong that it can limit the legitimate rights and dreams and creativity of the people. That is the tension of creating the right kind of democratic market society.
 
Growing Economies
The bottom line is that the American people very much want Russia to succeed. We value your friendship. We honor your struggle. We want to offer support as long as you take the steps needed for stability and progress. We will benefit greatly if you strengthen your democracy and increase your prosperity.
Look what our partnership has already produced. We've reversed the dangerous buildup of nuclear weapons. We're two years ahead of schedule in cutting nuclear arsenals under Start 1. Start 2, which still awaits ratification in the Duma, will reduce our nuclear forces by two-thirds from cold-war levels. President Yeltsin and I already have agreed on a framework for Start 3 to cut our nuclear arsenals even further.
For you young people, at a time when India and Pakistan have started testing nuclear weapons, America and Russia must resume the direction the world should take -- away from nuclear weapons, not toward them. This is a very important thing.
We are working to halt the spread of weapons of mass destruction. We signed the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty with 147 other countries. We're working to contain the arms race between India and Pakistan, to strengthen controls on transfers of weapons technology, to combat terrorism everywhere.
Our bonds are growing stronger. And as they do, we will move closer to our goal of a Europe undivided, democratic and at peace. We've reached agreements for greater cooperation between NATO and Russia. And our soldiers serve side by side, making peace possible in Bosnia.
We don't always agree and our interests aren't always identical, but we work together more often than not, and the world is a better place as a result. Building peace is our paramount responsibility, but there is more we must do together.
One thing we need to do more together is prove that you can grow the economy without destroying the environment. A great man, looking at the condition of the environment, charged that humanity was a destroyer. He wrote, "Forests keep disappearing. Rivers dry up. Wildlife has become extinct. The climate is ruined. The land grows poorer and uglier every day." Chekhov wrote those words 100 years ago. Just imagine his reaction to the present environmental conditions, with toxic pollution ruining our air and water, and global warming threatening to aggravate flooding and drought and disease.
 
Challenging Times
Together we can create cleaner technologies to grow our economies without destroying the world's environment and imperiling future generations. Together we can harness the genius of our citizens not for making weapons but for building better communications, curing disease, combating hunger and exploring the heavens.
Together we can reconcile societies of different people with different religions and races and viewpoints, and stand against the wars of ethnic, religious and racial hatred that have dominated recent history. If we stand together and if we do the right things, we can build that kind of world. If the people of Russia stand for economic reform that benefits all the people of this country, America will stand with you.
As the people of Russia work for education and scientific discovery, as they stand against corruption and for honest government, against the criminals and terrorists and for the safety of ordinary citizens, against aggression and for peace, America will proudly stand with you. It is the right thing to do, but it is also very much in the interest of the American people to do so.
I was amazed there were some doubters back in America who said perhaps I shouldn't come here because these are uncertain times politically and economically. And there's questions being raised in the American press about the commitment of Russia to the course of reform and democracy.
It seems to me that anybody can get on an airplane and take a trip in good times and that friends come to visit each other in challenging and difficult times. I come here as a friend because I believe in the future of Russia. I come here also because I believe someone has to tell the truth to the people, so that you're not skeptical when your political leaders tell you things that are hard to hear.
There is no way out of playing by the rules of the international economy if you wish to be a part of it. We cannot abandon the rules of the international economy. No one can. There is a way to preserve the social safety net and the social contract and to help the people who are too weak to succeed. There is a way to do that. And there are people who will help to do that. But it has to be done.
So I come here as a friend. I come here because I know that the future of our children and the future of Russia's young people are going to be entwined. And I want it to be a good future, and I believe it can be.

HEADLINE: For Some, Texas Town Is Too Popular as Waste Disposal Site

BYLINE: By RICK LYMAN 

DATELINE: SIERRA BLANCA, Tex., Sept. 1

 BODY:
Lupe Bustamante cradled a gallon of milk under her arm in the dim and sparsely stocked Guerra General Store on the main street of this dusty outpost, population 600, and wondered why the whole world seemed to want to dump on her tiny town.
First, New York City completed a deal to ship its treated sewage to a ranch outside Sierra Blanca, where the sewage has been spread on the ground since 1992. Then, a New Jersey company announced this summer that it hoped to ship New York sludge to a ranch in the nearby hamlet of Allamoore. And now, the State of Texas believes it is coming to the end of a decadelong effort to enter into a compact with Vermont and Maine to store their low-level nuclear waste, along with its own, at a site just outside Sierra Blanca. The waste would be sealed in concrete and buried beneath the rocky desert. 
 "I think maybe they choose us because we are a small town, because we are so distant from everyone and because we have no political power," Ms. Bustamante said. "I think maybe they are taking advantage of us. I believe that most of the people are opposed to it."
Many environmentalists and residents said that the town was picked only because it is poor and Hispanic. About two-thirds of Sierra Blanca's residents are Hispanic, and the per capita income is $8,000, according to Census Bureau figures.
But for others in Sierra Blanca, the waste site would bring a much-needed economic boost. Already, the town's largest employer, with 40 workers, is Merco Joint Venture, the company that has shipped 400 tons of New York City sludge every day since 1992 to a 128,000-acre ranch outside town.
A short walk down the lone commercial strip, past the ice cream parlor, a couple of auto repair shops and a boarded-up movie theater, James Schilling was putting the finishing touches on the Sierra Motel, a 67-year-old fieldstone complex that he is renovating.
"As for the low-level nuclear site, I'm all for it, and most of the town is for it, too," Mr. Schilling said. "We need progress in this town, and this facility will bring money and jobs here. I feel it will be safe."
On Wednesday, the United States Senate is expected to vote on the proposed three-state compact, which has been approved by the House.
Several residents of Sierra Blanca joined Senator Paul Wellstone, a Minnesota Democrat who has been the project's most vocal Congressional opponent, for a rally on the Capitol steps today, hoping to sway the vote. During Senate debate tonight, Mr. Wellstone said, "It is a fight for communities all across the country who don't have political clout."
If the proposal passes the Senate, as even many of its opponents believe it will, then all it will need is President Clinton's signature to become a reality. It would be the 10th such compact created since the 1980 passage of a Federal law urging states to cooperate in dealing with the disposal problems of low-level nuclear waste, which includes medical waste and parts and machinery from nuclear power plants that have become contaminated. States that enter a compact have some protection from the Federal Government's forcing them to accept waste from other states.
The passage of the compact would give Texas permission to build the site and provide much of the money for it, said Lee Mathews, general counsel for the Texas Low-level Radioactive Waste Disposal Authority, which has been looking since the early 1980's for a disposal site.
But the authority would still need a license from the state. Earlier this summer, two administrative law judges in Austin ruled that the authority's application for the license should be rejected because it failed to include a thorough geological survey of the site or a proper assessment of the proposal's socio-economic impact on Sierra Blanca and surrounding Hudspeth County.
But the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission, comprised of three officials appointed by Gov. George W. Bush, is not bound to follow the judges' ruling and can approve the license. Many environmentalists expect the commission to do so. Governor Bush, who had supported the project, says he is "troubled" by the decision of the judges and has urged the commission to "thoroughly review this recommendation and the facts to make their decision on sound science and the health and safety of Texans."
David Frederick, a lawyer for the Sierra Blanca Defense Fund, which was formed to fight the compact, said he thought there was "a real chance the commission will uphold the judges and reject the application."
"The common wisdom, however," Mr. Frederick said, "is that they will not."
The commission can make its ruling at any time, but it is not expected to until at least the fall.
The march to a low-level waste site has been a long one for Texas.
An initial site selected in the early 1980's in northern Hudspeth County was withdrawn after a storm of protest from residents. A second plan to locate the site in South Texas, in the scrublands between Laredo and Corpus Christi, was scuttled by objections from ranchers who instigated passage of a law mandating that the site be built only on state-owned land. Since most of that land is in West Texas, it pushed the waste disposal authority back into Hudspeth County, Mr. Mathews said.
A third site was selected in 1986, this time in Fort Hancock, near the El Paso County line. But the City of El Paso fought the proposal. Finally, in 1991, a judge ruled against the site and it, too, was abandoned.
By this time, a new state law had been passed mandating that the site be situated within a 400-square-mile box of land in Hudspeth County.
The site the authority came up with was a 16,000-acre ranch outside Sierra Blanca that the state bought from private owners.
Environmentalists rose up in opposition to this new site, asserting that it was geologically unsound, that it had been developed over known earthquake faults, and that it was chosen not for proper scientific reasons but because the area's residents were predominantly poor and Hispanic.
"Look, you and I both know this," Mr. Frederick said. "These people are low income, minority populations. They do not have a strong spokesperson in state government. It's obvious that this area was selected because it did not have the financial or political strength to pose serious opposition."
Project leaders say that the Sierra Blanca site was the best one available and that its selection had nothing to do with the town's makeup.
The project has also drawn vehement opposition from politicians in Mexico, particularly officials in the nearby states of Coahuila and Chihuahua and in the Mexican Legislature. A City Councilman from Ciudad Juarez and several supporters staged a hunger strike on one of the international bridges in El Paso. A delegation of Mexican officials flew to Austin to protest the project, but were rebuffed in efforts to meet with Governor Bush. Mexico's ruling party accused the United States of "economic racism."
Proponents of the site point to the improvements that have already come from tax money turned over to Hudspeth County for its decision to take the waste: a new football field, a library, a medical clinic, a new fire truck.
And after the dump site is built and operating, the money will continue to flow, proponents say. And there will be an estimated three dozen jobs at the site and maybe a few more at businesses catering to these new workers.
Mr. Mathews said that if the state license was granted later this year, as he expects it will be, the authority will still need to appeal to the Texas Legislature early next year for construction money.
Even if all goes well, Mr. Mathews said, the first shipment of waste would not arrive in Sierra Blanca until late 2000 or early 2001.
Sierra Blanca, some 90 miles southeast of El Paso, was once a ranching and railroad center. Now it is little more than a stretch of commercial buildings along a feeder road between two exits on Interstate 10, separated from the Rio Grande by the boulder-strewn Quitman Mountains, which create a sawtoothed silhouette in the desert haze.
There are three gas stations, three restaurants, a couple of RV parks, two motels, a general store, a grocery, a post office and a former rail depot that is now a county museum commemorating the moment in 1881 when the Southern Pacific's tracks met the Texas Pacific's right here in Sierra Blanca. The museum is open from 1 to 5 P.M., Wednesdays only.
Maria Mendez, a retired school aide from Allamoore, was part of the delegation that went to Washington this week to protest the compact.
"I don't know," Ms. Mendez said today. "I think Sierra Blanca was chosen for all of this dumping because we don't have any political clout. I think it's a racism thing; I really do. Here we are, the hugest dump in the whole world. First sludge, now nuclear waste. Our home has been taken over as the nation's dumping ground."

HEADLINE: THE MARKET TURMOIL: FINANCE;
5 Big Lenders Report Losses From Russia

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
Ripples from Russia's economic crisis are rapidly spreading through other financial markets, as Citicorp, Bankers Trust, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Barclays and Nomura Securities yesterday joined the growing list of companies reporting heavy losses on their Russian business.
Citicorp's chairman, John S. Reed, and its president, Victor J. Menezes, said in a statement to employees that they expected earnings for the three months ending on Sept. 30 to be cut by about $200 million because of losses related to Russia. 
 A significant part of Citicorp's loss can be traced to its backing of hedge funds managed by Dana McGinnis, a financier based in San Antonio, who made big bets on Russian securities and recently sought bankruptcy protection for three funds he oversees. The details of this investment are in dispute.
Mr. McGinnis declined yesterday to comment on his dispute with Citibank but said that "in general any creditor, such as Citibank, would be prudent to take a provision against what's happening in Russia." But, he added, "The situation is fluid and it is not yet certain that the country will walk away from its obligations."
Citicorp, the nation's No. 2 bank, also said that its plans to merge with the Travelers Group are "absolutely on track" and that it was confident of Federal Reserve approval, which it hopes will come before month's end. Earlier this week, Salomon Smith Barney, the Travelers investment banking subsidiary, estimated it had lost $360 million after taxes in the last two months from its arbitrage and Russian businesses, with $60 million of that directly attributable to Russian-related credit.
Bankers Trust, the seventh-largest American bank, said yesterday that to date, it had a $350 million pretax trading loss for the quarter ending on Sept. 30 that is "primarily attributable to charges to reduce the carrying amount of Bankers Trust's exposure to Russian Federation securities to 15 percent of face value."
As of Monday, Bankers Trust had about $350 million of remaining Russian loans and related assets, the company said, adding that half that amount had been financed with revenue generated in Western Europe. That includes loans to companies in Russia that have corporate parents in Western Europe, and assets that are covered by European government guarantees, said Doug Kidd, a Bankers Trust spokesman.
A Morgan Stanley spokesman, Jon Diat, read a statement yesterday saying that the firm "has been affected by the difficult conditions in global capital markets." As a result, "certain credit-sensitive trading activities, and a loss in connection with an institutional leveraged emerging-markets portfolio," will cause an estimated $110 million cut in net income for the quarter just ended.
In London, Barclays said it expected to take a charge of 250 million this year to cover potential losses on its 340 million of Russian lending and securities trading -- now equivalent to nearly $570 million. The big British bank also said its Barclays Capital investment banking subsidiary had probably lost as much as 75 million before taxes in the last two months because of the Russian crisis, or $125 million.
Nomura Securities, the largest Japanese brokerage firm, reported yesterday it had lost as much as $350 million on Russian bonds in the last year. Two big Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, have also disclosed hundreds of millions of Swiss francs of losses on their Russian businesses.
And the litany of losses is not over. New York analysts said they expected Chase Manhattan to make a statement about its losses on Russia, perhaps as early as today. A Chase spokesman declined to comment on the company's Russian business.
Western leaders are trying to press Russia into taking more responsibility for its financial obligations. In Moscow yesterday, President Clinton, on a trip to meet with President Boris N. Yeltsin and other leaders, urged the nation "to play by the rules" and "to treat investors fairly," or risk alienating badly needed sources of capital.
Discussing Bankers Trust's losses, Ronald I. Mandle, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company in New York, said the loss was bigger than he had expected. "A lot of investors looked at Russia as being too big to fail, and it turned out not to be," he said, adding that "it's extremely unusual to see a country default on its local-currency bonds."
Most of the bad news is out for big American banks, Mr. Mandle said, except for one or two larger institutions -- particularly Chase. Mr. Mandle said he had knocked his earnings estimates down a little for both Citicorp and Chase because of the Russian crisis.
Some analysts criticized the financial-services industry for this latest round of losses.
"This all shows us that banks and financial companies have not properly assessed the risks of their Russian businesses," said John Keefe, president of Keefe Worldwide, a New York financial-services consulting firm. "Banks go through this type of event every few years," he added, citing past problems with real estate investment trusts, Latin American loans, commercial real estate and holdings of junk bonds. "The latest problem is Russia."
Indeed, these new losses often are a result of lending to risk-taking speculators thousands of miles from Moscow in Western financial centers who are making bets on Russian securities.
Nevertheless, as Mr. Mandle and other analysts pointed out yesterday, United States and other big Western banks are now relatively well capitalized and should easily be able to absorb the kinds of losses caused by their loans to Russia.

HEADLINE: THE MARKET TURMOIL: HAPPY BEARS;
It'sa Nightmare for Most Shareholders, but a Dream Come True for Short-Sellers

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON 

 BODY:
Not everyone is lamenting the stock market's steep selloff. While many investors are still licking their wounds, even after yesterday's rally, some are celebrating. They may have stayed on the sidelines with cash, for example, immune to the damage in the last few weeks, or made astute bets in the Treasury market and racked up some gains.
Some of those with the widest grins are most likely those people who bet on a market downturn, selling stocks short by borrowing shares that they sell and hope to replace with cheaper shares as stock prices decline. The short-sellers are the ultimate bears, cheering any decline. 
 "We're making money in quite a few places," said David W. Tice, the manager of the Prudent Bear Fund, a mutual fund that specializes in shorting stocks. Prudent Bear posted a gain of about 30 percent in August. Among the areas that Mr. Tice has found most profitable for short sales are technology and banking stocks.
Most short-sellers seem to be making out handsomely. According to Michael R. Long, the principal of Rockbridge Research, a Charlotte, N.C., firm that specializes in analyzing short-selling trends, the short- sellers he follows are up about 25 to 30 percent so far this year.
These investors "have done phenomenally well, based on the current they are swimming in," said Mr. Long, who estimates short-sellers as a group had an average return of about 12 percent last year, even though the market was surging.
Even if their victory is short-lived and stocks resume their climb, short-sellers say the drop demonstrates that their strategy offers some protection to investors.
The short-sellers have had no trouble finding opportunities in recent weeks. And Mr. Tice says the market could drop much further because global deflationary forces will severely depress the earnings of American companies.
On the other hand, James S. Chanos, a longtime short-seller and president of Kynikos Associates, a money management firm, is agnostic on the outlook for the market. While the United States seems to be enjoying a strong economy, which would be positive for stocks, investors could refuse to come to the stock market's rescue and the country could slide into a recession. If that happens, "all bets are off," he said. "The downside is enormous."

HEADLINE: THE MARKET TURMOIL: POLICY -- Reading the Fed's Tea Leaves;
Some Doubt Lower Rates Will Follow Market Plunge

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 1

 BODY:
When faced with a Latin America that could no longer pay its debts during the summer of 1982, the Federal Reserve cast aside its tight-money policy and cut interest rates. When faced with a stomach-churning stock market drop in October 1987, the Fed acted quickly to pump more money into the system.
Does that mean the nation's central bank will now feel compelled to bring rates down to help stem the spread of global financial turmoil and restore some confidence to battered investors on Wall Street and around the world? 
 Don't count on it.
Sure, lots of people on Wall Street and some industry executives have stepped up their calls for the Fed to cut rates. Other countries, including Japan, have been floating proposals for the Fed to lead a move among the most powerful economies to bring rates down around the globe. And with long-term market interest rates already well below the official short-term rates controlled by the Fed, investors appear to have concluded that it is only a matter of time before the central bank begins easing.
Fed officials themselves have encouraged the speculation by making clear that they are less worried now than a few months ago about the combination of strong growth and low unemployment setting off a spiral of rising wages and prices that would demand an interest rate increase.
But unless the stock market drops precipitously over the next few weeks or the still-strong domestic economy shows sudden signs of stalling, many economists think there is little chance that the central bank will ease monetary policy anytime soon.
"It's quite unrealistic to expect a Fed easing at this point," said Bill Cheney, the chief economist at John Hancock Financial Services in Boston.
"Obviously if you get a real market meltdown in the style of 1987 with lots of players on Wall Street and elsewhere going broke from losses or liquidity problems, then the Fed will pump liquidity into the system," Mr. Cheney said. "But I don't think we're at that point."
If a nearly 20 percent decline in the stock market from its peak in mid-July to its sharp drop on Monday failed to force the Fed into action, neither did the collapse of Russia. Analysts said that rather than assuming the mantle of central bank to the world, the Fed and its chairman, Alan Greenspan, remained focused on tracking the domestic economy and on the core mission of maintaining price stability. Today's rebound only reinforces that tendency.
"Whenever people perceive a crisis, they say the Fed has to help out," said Mickey D. Levy, an economist at NationsBanc Montgomery Securities. "But historically, whenever the Fed takes its eye off the fundamentals and tries to tinker with the dollar or some other foreign activity, that's when it makes mistakes."
Mr. Greenspan may even be silently cheering the stock market's correction. Since the end of 1996, when he raised the question of "irrational exuberance," Mr. Greenspan has been warning in increasingly direct terms that investors had adopted an overly rosy view of the prospects for corporate earnings, leading to an overvalued stock market.
"He doesn't want risk to be undervalued in financial markets," Mr. Cheney said.
Mr. Greenspan has also been careful to point out that the Asian financial crisis has benefits as well as drawbacks for the American economy. With investors wary of putting their money into emerging markets, cash has been flooding into American Treasury securities, driving down long-term interest rates. The strength of the dollar has held down the price of imports, and the decline in demand for oil and other commodities throughout Asia has further helped damp inflation. Lower inflation has given consumers more purchasing power.
So while there are considerable risks from the spread of Asia's crisis and from the market's fall, for the moment the economy appears to be doing what Fed officials have hoped all along: slowing on its own to a growth rate that will neither ignite inflation nor raise unemployment.
Some economists think labor markets are still so tight, with unemployment at 4.5 percent, that wages will begin rising, perhaps squeezing profits and spurring companies to try to raise prices. As a result, Mr. Greenspan and the Fed will continue to look closely for signs of incipient inflation, and are already dissecting the recent decline in corporate earnings growth to see if it portends higher labor costs.
But the market's tumble will also force Mr. Greenspan to look for evidence of whether consumers are starting to rein in their spending or if the long boom in housing is beginning to peter out. Although economists argue about the magnitude, they agree that some portion of robust consumer spending over the last several years has derived from the feeling of affluence conferred by the rising stock market. The speed and magnitude with which the same phenomenon might go into reverse remains unclear.
A sharp enough decline could stall the economy or even tilt it into recession, forcing the Fed to cut rates to stimulate demand.
"They're going to want to see a sustained downward move in consumer confidence and then in spending itself before they move," said M. Carey Leahy, an economist at High Frequency Economics.
Economic indicators in recent days have done little to clarify the outlook. The National Association of Purchasing Management reported today that its survey of business conditions in August found a slight increase in activity. But the survey's new-orders component declined for the fourth time in six months.
"The new-orders series is probably very high on Mr. Greenspan's radar screen at the present," said David Orr, an economist at First Union Capital Markets Group. "It is moving toward an ease, but based on past evidence is not there yet."
The Conference Board, a business research organization, said today that its index of indicators intended to predict the future strength of the economy rose four-tenths of 1 percent in July, reversing a two-month decline and appearing to reinforce the view of a gradual slowing of economic growth.
"In general, the economy seems healthy, but growth prospects are not as strong as in the early part of 1998," said Michael Boldin, the board's director of business cycle research.
The Fed will also keep a close eye on the health and stability of the banking system and the securities industry. But unlike 1987, when banks were already suffering from a real estate bust and heavy losses on loans to developing nations, or 1982, when the failure of a small bank in Oklahoma was rocking major financial institutions like Continental Illinois in Chicago, the American financial system today is very healthy.
Short of a calamitous meltdown in the markets, the financial system appears unlikely to need any action by the Fed to provide cash to keep payments and settlements proceeding on an orderly basis.
Even if the domestic economy holds up reasonably well and the market decline does not turn into a crash, Mr. Greenspan will still have to be sensitive to any further erosion in the global economy, since the United States will ultimately be affected to some degree by what happens among its trading partners.
Fed officials have been tracking Latin America particularly closely in recent days. They worry that the region may become infected by the global credit squeeze that followed Russia's debt default and devaluation. Mexico and the big nations of South America receive almost 20 percent of American exports.
Mexico's financial crisis in 1994 led to a bailout by the Clinton Administration over objections from Congress. The 1982 crisis across Latin America was a key factor in the decision by the Fed under Paul Volcker, then the central bank's chairman, to shift its sights from squelching inflation to stimulating the economy at home and abroad by cutting rates. But at that time, said Lyle Gramley, a Fed governor from 1980 to 1985, the American economy was also mired in recession.
"The international considerations affected the decision, but there wasn't at that point any conflict at all between the international and domestic considerations," Mr. Gramley said. "Today the situation is very different. If we ask whether we're really sure that developments in the world economy have had an effect on economic growth in the United States, the answer is we can't be sure."
Mr. Levy said that a rate cut by the Fed could even have negative effects on the global crisis. Reducing rates in the United States, he said, might ease the pressure on other countries, especially Japan, to take the painful steps needed to shore up their economies.
"Domestic demand is strong," Mr. Levy said, ticking off reasons the Fed should not ease immediately. "Labor markets are tight. The U.S. banking system has more than enough liquidity and is well capitalized. And easing would not help Russia and would undermine U.S. efforts to lead Japan to reform."

GRAPHIC: Photo/Chart: "Which Way Will He Turn?"
With his control over interest rates, the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, must ponder a multitude of economic issues.
 
To Cut Rates . . .
The decline on Wall Street is not at the top of the list of Fed worries. But if a further precipitous market drop over the next few weeks seems to point toward serious weakness in the American economy or if events elsewhere suggest that the global financial system is on the verge of collapse, the Fed could move quickly to pump more money into the banking system.
 
. . . or Stand Pat
As long as growth remains on a moderate path and consumers continue to spend, the Fed is not likely to want to stimulate the economy in the United States by cutting interest rates. If anything, Fed officials may view the stock market fall as a healthy move that will prevent a runaway Wall Street boom from becoming a bust.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS;
Manufacturing In 3-MonthFall

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 1

 BODY:
Manufacturing activity contracted for the third consecutive month in August, suggesting that the economic turmoil in emerging markets was taking a toll on factory orders.
The National Association of Purchasing Management said today that its index of manufacturing activity rose to 49.4 in August from 49.1 in July. Despite the increase, the index remained below 50, meaning that most of the manufacturers surveyed said business was deteriorating. The index had been above 50, signaling growth, for 22 consecutive months before June. 
 "The manufacturing sector is in a serious retrenchment and will be for a number of months to come," said Chris Low, an economist at First Tennessee Capital Markets in New York.
So far, though, consumer spending and housing have provided a buffer against the crises in emerging markets and the slowdown in manufacturing. That might continue, according to two other economic reports issued today. The Conference Board said its index of leading economic indicators rose four-tenths of 1 percent in July, rebounding from two months of declines and reflecting an abundance of jobs. And the Government said that construction spending climbed four-tenths of 1 percent in July to a record level.

HEADLINE: THE MARKET TURMOIL: STOCKS;
Bargain-Hunters Drive Stocks Back Up as Volume Sets Record

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
The stock market yesterday regained more than half of the value it lost on Monday as trading volume set a record.
Traders and stock market analysts said that big institutions, like pension funds and insurance companies, took the lead in buying yesterday, picking through stocks that had been leveled by Monday's selloff. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 288.36 points, or 3.8 percent, to 7,827.43, essentially retracing the 250-point plunge that came in the frantic last half-hour of trading on Monday. That selloff, which market participants traced to an unusual confluence of events, pushed the bellwether stock gauge down 6.4 percent for the day. After yesterday's rebound, the Dow remains 16.2 percent below its high, reached in July, and about 1 percent below where it started the year.
The gain in the Dow yesterday was the second largest in points, after a 337-point jump on Oct. 28 of last year. In percentage terms, however, it ranked far down the list. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange set a record, with 1.21 billion shares changing hands. Nearly two stocks rose for every one that declined.
In jumping into the market yesterday, investors sought companies in which the recent declines seemed to ignore what are still good prospects for earnings growth for the rest of the year. The buying came after a turbulent opening during which the Dow rose sharply, then fell as much as 139 points below Monday's close, all in the first hour of trading. Then stocks started a climb of more than 400 points as measured by the Dow and closed near their highest point of the day.
But several market participants warned that economic uncertainties continued to plague overseas markets and could keep pressure on the United States stock market through autumn.
"On Monday, there were three sellers for every buyer," said Michael Clark, a managing director at Credit Suisse First Boston who oversees the company's United States equity trading. Such an order imbalance is only remedied when prices fall enough to reduce the number of sellers or attract more buyers. "Today, people were willing to look for values."
They did so, however, with some caution. "I think most people have one foot back in the water now, but not two," Mr. Clark said.
Several of Wall Street's top investment strategists voiced their beliefs that the American economy remained strong and that Monday's stock market decline went too far too fast, echoing their sentiments after previous sharp declines, including the 7.2 percent drop in the Dow last Oct. 27.
And some even told investors to increase their bets. Abby Joseph Cohen, the steadfastly bullish strategist at Goldman, Sachs & Company, told investors that they should increase their holdings of equities to 72 percent of assets from her previous recommendation of 65 percent and that cash holdings should be reduced to zero from a previous level of 5 percent. The remainder of investors' portfolio should consist of 25 percent in fixed-income securities and 3 percent in commodities, down from 5 percent.
Many of the biggest gains yesterday came in stocks that were hit the hardest on Monday, including shares of technology companies like Dell Computer, Cisco Systems and Microsoft. The Nasdaq composite index, which is heavily weighted with technology shares, rose nearly 76 points, or 5.1 percent, to 1,575.09. On Monday, the index fell 8.6 percent. Nasdaq volume was a heavy 1.25 billion shares yesterday, second only to last Oct. 28, when it was 1.35 billion.
Also gaining yesterday was the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which rose almost 37 points, or 3.9 percent, to 994.26. Despite a decline of 6.8 percent on Monday, yesterday's gain put the S.& P. 500 nearly 2.5 percent above where it started the year. And the Russell 2000 index, a measure of small-company stocks that has been the hardest hit this year, rose 3 percent yesterday.
With their heavy buying yesterday, investors seemed to be saying that Monday's late-afternoon selloff overstated the possible negative effects faced by American companies. Market participants said that several factors contributed to the selloff, which lopped 250 points off the Dow from 3:30 to 4 P.M.
That last half-hour of trading appeared to be driven in part by sophisticated trading strategies, including index arbitrage, a technique that involves trading futures contracts based on the the S.& P. 500 as well as the 500 stocks that make up the index.
The futures contract and the cumulative value of the stocks in the index are usually worth roughly the same amount. But in volatile markets a gap sometimes opens up between their prices, and traders can try to lock in the difference as profit by selling the more expensive item and buying the cheaper one.
Late Monday, the futures prices, driven by an overwhelmingly negative market psychology throughout the day, fell far more sharply than the stock prices did. Seeing that, some traders bought the futures and then sold the stocks.
As they did so, several other types of sellers were also lining up at the door. Mutual funds were trying to complete sell orders that they had placed earlier in the day, equity traders said. The funds appeared to be seeking to lighten their holdings of stocks in part to pay off shareholder redemptions but also simply to raise cash in their portfolios, which would help them to avoid further market declines.
In addition, Monday was the last day of August. In a note to clients, Ms. Cohen of Goldman, Sachs noted that month-end pressures to meet margin requirements might have played a role in Monday's decline.
The combined effect of that selling caused any possible buyers to step away, traders said. "Buyers simply took a holiday," said Robert Fagenson, a specialist at the New York Stock Exchange firm of Fagenson Frankel & Streicher, who also serves as a vice chairman of the exchange. "They looked around and said whatever they wanted to buy, they would tomorrow at a lower price."
After realizing that some of the reasons for Monday's decline were fleeting rather than permanent, investors and traders returned to the stock market yesterday determined to look for bargains, resulting in the big rally.
All of the stock market's signs were not positive, however, and many of those who breathed a sigh of relief after yesterday's rally acknowledged that more turbulence could lie ahead.
Edward Collins, head of trading at Daiwa Securities America, noted that the stocks of many banks and financial-service companies did not participate in yesterday's rally, perhaps because investors are worried about further losses from the recent downturn in global financial markets.
Indeed, shares of some financial companies have been battered recently. Bankers Trust, which announced yesterday that it expected to report a third-quarter loss because of trading losses, saw its stock fall $1.1875, to $73.125 yesterday, about half the price it traded for in April.
Shares of Citicorp and Travelers Group, which are scheduled to merge later this year, also fell yesterday. After the close of trading, Citicorp announced that losses from holdings of Russian securities would reduce its third-quarter net income by $200 million.
Investors might be warranted in expressing some continued caution as September begins, if only because this is traditionally the stock market's worst month.
Part of the reason, market analysts say, is because corporate executives and boards turn their attention in the fall to budgets for the coming year, reassess the business outlook and are thus more prone to warn investors of earnings shortfalls.
That certainly could be the case this fall, especially when companies already appear to be thinking twice about new spending programs, said Albert Wojnilower, a New York economist. "So many decisions companies make these days are premised by what effect it will have on their stock price," Mr. Wojnilower said. "When boards come back and meet after Labor Day, I think they will take a more cautious view on things."

HEADLINE: S.A.T. Scores Decline Even as Grades Rise

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

 BODY:
Calling it evidence of persistent grade inflation in American high schools, College Board officials said yesterday that more college-bound students had A averages than a decade ago but that they scored lower on their S.A.T. exams.
The College Board, which sponsors the S.A.T., said that test takers with A averages grew from 28 percent of the total to 38 percent in the last 10 years, but the S.A.T. scores of those students fell an average of 12 points on the verbal portion and 3 points on the math portion. 
 The disparity between grades and the S.A.T., the nation's leading standardized college entrance test, is sufficiently troubling that the president of the College Board, Donald M. Stewart, said the organization has commissioned a study of the issue by Rand. the research institution.
"We don't know why grades are rising," Mr. Stewart said. "The trend may reflect positive changes in education, but it may also reflect greater focus on personal qualities instead of academic achievement."
Over all, S.A.T. scores remained about the same this year as last: 512 on the math portion, a point above last year and the highest in 27 years, and 505 on the verbal portion, the same as last year. The figures were released yesterday in the College Board's annual report on the 1.2 million students who took the S.A.T. before they graduated from high school last spring.
The board also reported that substantially greater numbers of high school students were taking the test and that more were enrolled in advanced placement courses, making them eligible for college credit before enrollment.
Mr. Stewart said the scores revealed two troubling trends. One is that suburban students are improving their S.A.T. scores, while urban and rural students are falling further behind, with a 30-point gap between urban and suburban students.
"This growing disparity is particularly troublesome," Mr. Stewart said, "because 40 to 50 percent of African-American and Latino students who take the S.A.T. live in large cities."
Also, the S.A.T. scores of the children of parents with less education are falling further below the national average, the report said.
These conclusions were based on the College Board's analysis of the 1.2 million seniors who took the SAT1: Reasoning Test, and the 321,000 who took college-level Advanced Placement Examinations before they graduated from high school last June.
The evidence of continuing grade inflation comes at a time when many states are requiring schools to adopt higher standards, though sometimes grading the students on the basis of portfolios of their work.
"More subjectivity is going into assessments," Mr. Stewart said. "This also could be the result of the increased emphasis on accountability by teachers. That is, since teachers are supposed to be teaching better they are giving out phony grades in an unconscious effort to show themselves well -- something that is exploded by the S.A.T. tests."
Bob Schaeffer, a spokesman for Fairtest, a longtime critic of testing services, warned that the prevalence of grade inflation should not be taken as an argument that the S.A.T. "keeps the process honest." He said that proponents of the S.A.T. "admit that high school performance is a better predictor of how someone will do at college than is the S.A.T."
Bob Chase, president of the National Education Association, the nation's largest union with 2.4 million members, cautioned against blaming teachers for grade inflation. "If it's happening," he said, "no one could be supportive of that, but it may result from pressures from both parents and the schools. We just don't know."
Seppy Basili, a spokesman for Kaplan Educational Centers, the largest test preparation company in the nation, said "grade inflation is here to stay," and may be explained in part by the popularity of advanced-placement courses. "Students who do well in A.P. courses may receive a weighted grade which is higher than an A," he said.
Howard Everson, the College Board's chief research scientist, said that the increased number of students taking the test is "good news for the nation."
"It shows that there is a growing cohort of those who aspire to attend a competitive college," he said.
Mr. Basili attributed the rise in math scores over the last four years to a rule change that permitted students to bring along their calculators when taking the test.
"Having their calculators made them feel comfortable, and helped them to avoid making sloppy mistakes," Mr. Basili said.
Mr. Stewart also said that even though there were growing gaps in the scores of urban and suburban students, there was relatively good news for minorities. "Despite the recent backlash against affirmative action, racial and ethnic minorities continue to see college as the route to a better life," he said. "This year, minority students are a record one-third of the S.A.T. population and 28 percent of AP graduates, and more of them aspire to master's and Ph.D. degrees."
Ward Connerly, a black trustee of the University of California who has long opposed affirmative action, said he sees the increased number of racial and ethnic minorities who take the test as a welcome indication of their growing confidence.
"What this really represents is that with the demise of preferences in California and Texas, and soon the entire nation, blacks and Latinos are beginning to realize that they can make it without preferences," Mr. Connerly said.
Mr. Stewart faulted Mr. Connerly for failing to seek an alternative to affirmative action to equalize opportunity. Mr. Stewart said he, too, would oppose preferences, "but only if we can find a way to create equal educational opportunity."
In another trend reflected in this year's tests, many students' career aspirations seemed out of step with the prospect for jobs in the years ahead. Student test takers were asked to check off on questionnaires the careers they hope to pursue. Labor Department projections indicate that the top three occupations expected to grow most rapidly between now and 2006 are computer-related. Yet relatively few students (5 percent) checked off computing and information sciences.
Students' first career choice was health and allied services (18 percent), followed by business and commerce (14 percent) and social sciences and history (11 percent).
The S.A.T. was taken by 43 percent of all high school graduates, or about 1.2 million students.
The College Board is the nonprofit educational association that sponsors the S.A.T., which is developed and administered by the Educational Testing Service. The S.A.T. is the dominant test on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. The A.C.T. is more popular in the central United States.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Send Russia Alerts About Missiles

 BODY:
Now that the nuclear standoff with the Soviet Union is over, the United States has found a new use for its warning systems -- alerting the Russians about missile launchings around the world. President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin plan to sign an accord to share data about the launching of ballistic missiles and space payloads. 
 With Russia's economy deteriorating by the day and its Government in political crisis, arms control no longer holds center stage. And the United States has become increasingly worried that the warning system in Russia is so frayed that it might misinterpret the data and conclude mistakenly that it was under attack.

The Price of Cleveland's Heart

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
Bart Wolstein has built country clubs, strip malls, Kmarts and offices. They made him fabulously rich, but the thrills are past. Now when Wolstein, the son of a Minsk cloth cutter, thinks of what he must do, one thing remains: buying the Cleveland Browns.
"There is no more excitement in the world than owning a team on game day," Wolstein, who once owned the Cleveland Force of the Major Indoor Soccer League, said during an interview in his suburban Cleveland office. Feeling left out of Cleveland's business elite, he seeks entree to a club more exclusive than the United States Senate. "An N.F.L. guy is an entrepreneur," he said. "I'm their kind of guy." 
 Wolstein is leading one of the four groups still competing in a unique bazaar: the National Football League's auction of the revived Browns for what is almost certain to be the highest price ever for a sports team, one that could double the $311 million paid this year for the Los Angeles Dodgers.
The price tag apparently grew too steep for three of the seven original bidders: they dropped out yesterday before second bids were due at noon. Next Tuesday, N.F.L. owners will meet in Chicago to award the franchise to one of the remaining four groups.
The new Browns will succeed the old ones, a beloved team that helped define this city's sports psyche but was moved in 1996 by the debt-ridden owner, Art Modell, to the comfort of a revenue-rich new stadium in Baltimore. Modell, who gave up the Browns' name, logo and colors as part of the agreement that allowed him to move, will not get a share of the Browns franchise fee.
The scale of the financial competition for the Browns -- featuring millionaire, billionaire and celebrity partners, including Bill Cosby and Don Shula, and bidding rationales like civic duty and a pained conscience -- captures the bacchanalian nature of modern sports business.
The sale of the Browns occurs at a time when television networks gladly overspend to secure the long-term rights to pro football; players sign contracts that exceed what the owner paid for the team; teams sell for ever-higher prices, and cities help pay for sports palaces despite urgent municipal needs.
In Cleveland, for example, the public school system is in receivership, and Mayor Michael White will take control of it -- one day after the Browns' auction. City taxes will pay 58 percent of the cost of a new $280 million, 72,800-seat stadium.
"The income streams for the stadium couldn't be used for schools, so we're not robbing children to pay for football," White said. "Far more important is keeping a community mosaic; just as the Browns are important, so are universities, art museums and public education."
And so the race to acquire the Browns raises again the question of how to measure what a team means to a city -- in this case, a city left furious at Modell's perceived carpetbagging.
And what does owning the Browns mean to the bidders who acknowledge that instant profits are hardly likely? "Each bidder has his own motivations and objectives for their investment," said Roger Goodell, an N.F.L. senior vice president. "Some see it for return on their investment, some for asset appreciation."
How slim the profits may be is well understood.
"Do you think," the billionaire credit card executive Alfred Lerner asked facetiously, "that I can get all the way up to a little return?"
The extent to which this week's stock market correction may influence bidding is unknown. Two of the remaining bidders, Charles F. Dolan, chairman of Cablevision Systems, and Lerner, chairman of MBNA Corp., run public companies, while a third, Wolstein, is chairman emeritus of the publicly traded Developers Diversified Realty, which his son runs.
 
The Numbers Scare Some Off
 For months, there were seven candidates; second bids were due at noon yesterday and were to form the basis of talks between the groups and Goldman, Sachs & Company, the N.F.L.'s financial adviser, which will seek to negotiate still higher bids. The first round of bids last month created an informal floor estimated at $350 million. The highest bidder will not necessarily win; the league will present at least two finalists to the 30 owners next Tuesday, and a winner will have to be approved by at least 23 of them.
But three groups declined to make second bids: Thomas G. Murdough Jr., president of Step2, a toymaker, and Richard E. Jacobs, the Cleveland Indians' majority owner, who had merged their efforts last week, and Jeremy Jacobs, chairman of the food concessionaire Delaware North and owner of the Boston Bruins.
"The numbers didn't work," Murdough said, citing cost overruns at the stadium that have already reached $33 million, and other financial unknowns. "After $450 million, it didn't make sense, and I got a good indication that some people would go over $500 million. I think common sense prevailed."
He added: "You hope the people you're competing with are sane enough and have enough business acumen. But I think a couple of groups are going to go nutty."
Now, four remain: Lerner, Dolan, Wolstein and Howard Milstein, the New York-based real estate mogul.
The league inaugurated the financial hullabaloo in March when it chose to revive the Browns as an expansion team and not as one relocated from another city.
It awakened Richard Jacobs to a new challenge. "I'm like the Dalmatian in the firehouse," he said last month. "I hear the bell and I'm off."
But he added: "There's a limit to anything. It depends on what they want -- money or a good operator."
The league also decided not to set a minimum bid or a flat expansion fee, letting the bidders set the market. In 1993, the league charged Jacksonville and Carolina expansion fees of $140 million.
"We let them evaluate the asset and the outstanding, unique opportunity," Goodell said of the Browns' bidders. "They are all sophisticated investors who will submit the bid they feel will be worth it."
Their evaluation is based on:
*A stadium lease that will put every dollar of revenue in the owner's pocket, requiring him to pay only annual rent of $250,000 and the cost of operations. Everything else is his: gate receipts (visiting teams get 40 percent), club seat payments, rentals of 116 luxury suites, stadium naming rights that are expected to sell for $3 million a year, concessions and signage.
*New N.F.L. television contracts that guarantee each team $70 million annually.
*Fans who will fill the stadium 10 times a year. Already, 52,400 season tickets have been sold and 94 of the 116 luxury boxes have been leased.
What if one bidder shucks financial sense with a pre-emptive strike? "If someone is that stupid, to bid more than it's worth, that's a choice you have to make," Wolstein said. "If a guy bids too high, why would you want him as a partner?"
 
Making a Pitch Beyond Money
 Each of the bidders has done what he felt was necessary to boost his bid. Some have hired public relations firms or have flown around the country to schmooze with owners. Cosby made a tape for Charles Dolan, who is putting together the financing for a group whose general partner is his brother, Lawrence, a Cleveland lawyer.
Some have hired renowned football names. Dolan added Don Shula as his prospective chief of football operations. Milstein is bankrolling a group with the former Browns Paul Warfield and Calvin Hill. Wolstein brought in Brown and said Mike McCormack, former president of the expansion Carolina Panthers and an offensive tackle for the Browns in the 1950's, will run the Browns if he wins. After being persuaded to bid by Carmen Policy, the former president of the San Francisco 49ers, Lerner had to defend the decision he made, as a limited partner of the old Browns, to advise Modell to move to Baltimore.
"Did I help him? Yes," Lerner said. "Would he have moved without me? Yes."
Still, he described his urge to own the new Browns as "an act of conscience" toward his adopted city. The Brooklyn-born Lerner added, "I feel I should make this happen."
Meanwhile, the Dolans live with backing from Modell, who is expected to lobby against Lerner, a former friend, next Tuesday. "Art Modell has adopted us," Lawrence Dolan said. "We can't help it."
Shortly after the N.F.L. approved Modell's move in 1996 and promised to put a team back in Cleveland, it created the Cleveland Browns Trust, with a $15 million budget, to restore the team's business to viability. There were no players, no coaches, no advertisers and no games to play, yet a staff set to work in the old team's training facility in Berea, Ohio.
"We had no blueprint," said Bill Futterer, the trust's president. "People ask, 'How do you operate a team without any players?' "
 
A Team Spirit Waiting for a Team
 Futterer said he had marketable stars the fans already loved. They happen to be retired.
"I've got Brian Sipe at quarterback, Jim Brown running and Paul Warfield at receiver," he said.
Futterer traveled through Ohio and other states to meet with fans, ethnic groups, civic associations and fraternal organizations -- 289 personal appearances and 47,000 people. Initially, the goal was to assuage anger felt toward Modell, then to assure them of the Browns' return.
"At the outset, it was hard to separate us from Modell," he said. "They were angry. Not at the Browns. But at the N.F.L. At pro football."
Television and radio programs were produced. Alumni flag football games and charitable fund-raisers were staged. A Web site was created. The rabid network of Browns Backers clubs was resuscitated.
Ultimately, Futterer's goal was to sell. First came the personal seat licenses, fees for the right to buy season tickets, with the revenues to be used to repay the N.F.L.'s $63 million loan to help build the stadium. "We wanted them to feel that the people using the stadium most would pay more than the taxpayers did," Futterer said. Then came the season tickets, luxury suites and club seats. The trust hired scouts and player personnel executives, led by Joe Mack, a former Carolina Panthers assistant general manager.
Mack's group is faced with developing a team in less than one year, half the time the Carolina and Jacksonville expansion teams had before taking the field for the 1995 season. Like everyone at Berea, he knows he could be gone pretty soon.
"The worst-case scenario is you're starting the building blocks of a great franchise," he said. "That's not so bad."
Now a third season starts in Cleveland without the Browns. The "Dawg Pound" of rabid, barking fans has dispersed. Sundays have been empty, but life has gone on. The Indians' success has provided partial solace, at least into October.
"I watched Ohio State football on Saturday," said John Kristofeld of Columbus, "and spent quality time with my family on Sunday."
Dawn and Gary Brochetti of Euclid were die-hard Dawg Pounders. For two years, they kept a box full of Browns T-shirts, caps and other goods sealed. Across it, she wrote, "Don't Open Until '99."
"We survived," said Dawn Brochetti, a part-time probation officer, "but only because we knew the Browns were coming back."
Whether money that was not spent on tickets and beer at Municipal Stadium or munchies for TV-watching faithful was spent in significant numbers on other pursuits in the region is not known.
"There's probably been a loss because of the absence of transactions at the stadium and spending by high-salaried athletes," said Chris Warren, the city's economic development director. "But that's been more than offset by the huge success of the baseball team."
Although the old Browns contributed an estimated $77 million to the local economy annually, Warren admitted that the team's presence is important mainly as an asset to help civic image and psyche.
"Economically, football isn't a big deal," Wolstein said. "It's only 10 days a year. One factory with 250 people has more impact."
The psychic value of the Browns was displayed vigorously on Aug. 21, when the team staged a rally in a downtown mall to mark the 365th day before the new Browns' first preseason game. Fans lined up to buy Browns caps, watches and tote bags. Children lined up for autographs from John Thompson, a local superfan dubbed Big Dawg, who wielded an oversized dog bone and barked from behind a hound dog mask.
The 40 former Browns -- from Marion Motley to Bob Golic to Lou Groza -- who were introduced were greeted with whoops and cheers. They descended a staircase, some limping, some wearing jerseys stretched tautly over their paunches.
"Give it up for Ot-to Graham!" the announcer roared for the 76-year-old quarterback. "Now give it up for Gluefingers!" he said, and down the steps came receiver Dante Lavelli, now 75.
The fans were celebrating the past, but on the podium sat four former Browns seeking a piece of the future: Brown, Hill, Warfield and McCormack.
"We're getting ready, right?" bellowed Brown, wearing a Browns home jersey with his familiar No. 32 and a kufi cap atop his shaved head.
"Do you believe?" Warfield said. "Do you believe?"

HEADLINE: Old Wage Plan for Cabbies Gets Another Look

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN 

 BODY:
Taxi executives, worried that the city wants to modify or eliminate the cab-leasing system that has become an economic linchpin of the industry, proposed a pilot program yesterday under which 100 cabbies would work on commission, as most did until the 1980's.
Industry leaders say that leasing -- a policy that transformed cabbies from fleet employees into independent contractors who pay up to $110 per shift for use of a car -- brought the taxi business back from the brink of disaster. But many drivers have complained that the policy, which was legalized in 1979, has led drivers to work longer hours for lower wages. The system has also been cited frequently in recent months as contributing to reckless driving and an increase in accidents during the 1990's. 
 The taxi executives said that their pilot program, suggested at a Taxi and Limousine Commission hearing on the leasing system, would be an attempt to make sure that if changes were made, they were done on the basis of objective research.
"Back in '79, when we ran a commission garage, we were going out of business," said Ron Sherman, the president of the Metropolitan Taxicab Board of Trade, which represents big fleet owners. "We need current statistical data to see if the system could work today. If it will work, we're not opposed to it."
The chairwoman of the agency, Diane McGrath-McKechnie, has refused to say what changes, if any, she is seeking. She said she called the hearing simply to learn more about how leasing was working and whether it was the best way to keep good drivers in the industry. But most of her questions at the hearing focused on the relative merits of the leasing and commission systems.
Mr. Sherman's organization and the New York City Committee on Taxi Safety, a group of medallion brokers, proposed operating a garage on the commission system for two years in cooperation with the Taxi and Limousine Commission and comparing the drivers' income and safety records with those of drivers working under the leasing system.
Members of the taxi agency were surprised by the proposal and some seemed eager to hear more about it. But Ms. McGrath-McKechnie was skeptical.
"My immediate response would be, why are you doing that and what do you hope to accomplish, and why now?" she said after the hearing. But she added that the agency would consider all suggestions carefully before taking any action.
Under the pre-1979 system based on commissions, most drivers who did not own medallions split their fares with fleet owners almost 50-50 and received health insurance and other benefits. But during the 1970's, fleets began to run into financial trouble, in part, they said, because cabbies often stole from them by doing business off the meter and pocketing the entire fare.
Regulators legalized leasing in 1979 as an alternative to granting a fare increase. Owners embraced it because it gave them a guaranteed income from the lease payments and cut administrative costs.
Since then, most major cities have adopted the leasing system. But critics have maintained for years that it unfairly shifts the financial risk of operating a cab to the driver and has enriched fleet owners and medallion brokers at their expense.
In a 1996 study, two former New York City taxi regulators reported that in 1981, when most fleet drivers still worked on commission, the average fleet driver worked a nine-hour shift and earned $55 in cash and $21 in benefits. By 1986, when most drivers leased their cabs, the average driver worked a 12-hour shift and made $64 in cash and $3 in benefits -- a 23 percent drop in total compensation per hour, the study found.
In contrast, the authors found, the average cab owner's profit per shift rose to $57 for 12 hours in 1986, from $33 for 9 hours in 1981, a 30 percent increase in profit per hour.
The debate over leasing is hardly open-and-shut. Some fleet owners say that drivers earn more by leasing than under the commission system, and that a driver with a leased car is more productive.
Most of the dozen or so drivers who testified yesterday, in fact, said that they had worked under both systems and preferred leasing because it gave them greater flexibility with their schedules and rewarded them for working harder.
Ms. McGrath-McKechnie, though, was hesitant to take their words at face value.
"Many of the drivers we heard from," she said, "their bosses were sitting in this room. I'm not sure how independently and freely they thought that they could speak. We'll have to speak to them on their own."

HEADLINE: West Isn't to Blame For Russia's Mess

 BODY:

To the Editor:
It is counterproductive to look for someone in the West to blame for Russia's political and economic collapse (Week in Review, Aug. 30). Yes, there were mistakes and problems, but the blame lies with the Russians themselves. 
 President Boris N. Yeltsin has repeatedly wavered between supporting market reforms and supporting the status quo. As recently as January, Mr. Yeltsin diminished the roles of reformers and left his Prime Minister at the time, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, who is not an ardent reformer, in control of economic policy.
Some of the blame also lies with the so-called reformers. In the parliamentary elections of 1993 and 1995 they were unable to leave egos aside and backed several pro-reform candidates, thus diluting their strength. As a result, the Communists gained control of Parliament. Reformers also allowed the controversial loans-for-shares program to go forward, which only enriched the oligarchs, and ultimately emboldened them to demand Prime Minister Sergei V. Kiriyenko's dismissal.
President Clinton is right to go to Moscow, but the message he delivers there must be unequivocal: Mr. Yeltsin must push reform forward or there will be no more aid from the West. Moreover, all factions must cooperate or Russia may well collapse.

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN MOSCOW: THE OVERVIEW;
Clinton Tells Moscow Crowd That Future Won't Be Easy

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Sept. 1

 BODY:
President Clinton delivered a sober lecture to Russian leaders and the Russian people today about the hard realities of capitalism and the price of international support for relief from Russia's current financial crisis.
In meetings with President Boris N. Yeltsin and the temporary caretakers of Russia's paralyzed political and economic institutions, and in a speech to students at a Moscow university, Mr. Clinton warned that there is no easy escape from the financial catastrophe that has closed banks, left millions of workers unpaid and caused the collapse of the Government. 
 "The stakes are enormous," Mr. Clinton told a group of students and young business leaders at the Moscow State University for International Relations this afternoon. "Every choice Russia makes today may have consequences for years and years to come. Given the facts before you, I have to tell you that I do not believe there are any painless solutions. And indeed, an attempt to avoid difficult solutions may only prolong and worsen the present challenges." Excerpts, page A10.
The first day of Mr. Clinton's two-day visit to Moscow was markedly muted, fitting for a summit meeting whose purpose was far from clear, given Russia's turmoil and its lack of a functioning Government. Mr. Yeltsin's precarious political position and Mr. Clinton's unresolved legal problems at home added to the sense of gloom enveloping his trip.
Mr. Clinton's meetings with Mr. Yeltsin were businesslike and lacking in the back-slapping bonhomie that has characterized several of their earlier meetings, officials said. The state dinner tonight broke up at 9:15 P.M. after barely an hour; in past years such affairs have lasted well past midnight.
The only concrete accords to be announced at the meeting are agreements to reduce both nations' plutonium stockpiles and to share data on ballistic missile launchings. Both were were negotiated in the weeks leading up to the summit meeting, but even after the accords are signed, the details of both remain to be fleshed out.
American officials considered canceling the long-planned summit meeting because the prospects for meaningful progress were nil, but decided late last week to proceed because they concluded that abandoning the meeting would heap insult on Russia's multiple internal injuries.
The day was drab and rainy, unseasonably cold even for late summer in Moscow. Mr. Clinton's solemn speech at the university -- the only extended public remarks he will deliver on the visit -- matched the mood of this sullen city. While he offered words of encouragement and vows of friendship, the message was blunt and bleak. Russia's creditors and its international partners, the President said, will not tolerate a return to state control of important industries, efforts to escape financial hardship by printing rubles or special favors for cronies of powerful figures in the Kremlin.
"The challenge is to create a new Russia that benefits all responsible citizens of this country," Mr. Clinton said in a 35-minute address that was not once interrupted by applause. "How do you get there? I do not believe it is by reverting to the failed policies of the past."
Mr. Clinton then spelled out what he called "the rules of the road" that Russia must follow if it wishes to become a modern state in the global economy. They included a fair and consistent tax collection system, anti-inflationary Government monetary policy, legal protections for property owners and investors, steps to halt accelerating capital flight and an end to sweetheart deals for the tycoons who dominate an increasing share of Russia's legitimate and black-market economies.
"These are not radical theories," Mr. Clinton said. "They are simply facts proven by experience. How Russia reacts to them will fundamentally affect your future."
The hand-picked audience in the hall already agreed with most of what Mr. Clinton had to say, said Yekaterina Drozdova, a recent graduate of the university now working for the United States Agency for International Development in Moscow.
"All these people present are already for all of that," she said. "He might better try to impose his influence on the powerful structures."
She also mildly criticized Mr. Clinton for not speaking more forthrightly about politics in Russia. "The international community should express an opinion on what is going on in our country," she said.
Boris Chernyshev, a physiologist in his late 20's, also agreed with most of Mr. Clinton's views. "What would you expect him to say?" Mr. Chernyshev said. "It was all kind of predictable. I think it's just true."
Mr. Clinton's message to Mr. Yeltsin and to Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, the Acting Prime Minister, echoed that of his speech, according to Strobe Talbott, the deputy secretary of state who attended the morning and luncheon sessions.
Mr. Talbott said the United States would refrain from comment on Mr. Yeltsin's effort to piece together a Government from the battling powers of the lower house of Parliament or Duma, regional leaders and business interests.
"We have assiduously maintained our respect for the sovereignty of the Russian democratic political system," he said. "We're not going to pick and choose among Russian individual political figures, Russia's parties, factions in the current Duma, not least, to be very honest with you, because I'm not sure it would be helpful to those we wanted to help for us to create a hierarchy of whose policies we think most promising."
Nonetheless, he added, a return to control by Communist or other reactionary forces would not be greeted kindly by the United States and other Western nations. "The President said very clearly today in his speech at the institute that he hoped and believed that Russia would keep moving forward and not go back and try policies that have so clearly and dramatically and disastrously failed in the past," Mr. Talbott said.
Mr. Clinton's day in Moscow began with a brief arrival ceremony at Vnukovo II airport, where he was met by Mr. Chernomyrdin. Mr. Clinton and Mr. Chernomyrdin held preliminary discussions in the President's car on the way into Moscow, where they talked chiefly about Russia's current economic challenges, Mr. Talbott said.
Mr. Clinton placed a wreath at the tomb of the unknown soldier along the Kremlin wall, and then proceeded to a 90-minute private meeting with Mr. Yeltsin in the Russian President's ornate oval-shaped study.
Mr. Yeltsin greeted the American delegation, which included Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright; Bill Richardson, the Secretary of Energy; Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser; Gene Sperling, director of the National Economic Council, and Lawrence H. Summers, the Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. Mr. Yeltsin presented his visitors with a replica of an American flag given by an American delegation to Russia in 1866.
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Yeltsin met privately, then held a working lunch attended by about a half-dozen senior officials on each side. Apart from the economic and political crises gripping the country, the leaders discussed the ethnic bloodshed in Kosovo, Iraqi noncompliance with international arms monitoring and American concerns about Russian missile technology sales to Iran, according to Mr. Talbott.
After lunch, Mr. Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton, the First Lady, visited Elementary School No. 19, on the eastern bank of the Moscow River, to mark the official opening of Russian schools.
A group of well-scrubbed youngsters warmly applauded the Clintons and presented them with a doll and a plaque. Igor Dyomin, 7, wearing a sailor suit, performed a version of the high-kicking Cossack dance, to the delight of the Clintons.
In brief remarks, Mr. Clinton referred to Russia's current troubles and praised the courage and patience the Russian people have shown in earlier crises. He encouraged the students to explore the Internet, work to repair the environment and expand the frontiers of knowledge.
And he said: "I know that Russian students love to read and are proud of your country's great writers. A teacher here in Moscow asked her first grade class why they thought reading was important. One girl stood up and answered, 'You can read any book. You can read Pushkin.' No one in the first grade in my country is reading Pushkin."
The children laughed.

Straddling a Line Between Political Worlds

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
WHATEVER this weekend's rally for black youths turns out to be -- a peaceable protest, a thunderhead of rage and malevolence, a forgettable fizzle -- it will take place on David A. Paterson's doorstep.
In its pride and its anger, most of Harlem eventually passes by his family's apartment near 132d Street and Malcolm X Boulevard, and as the area's State Senator and scion of one of its most prominent families, Mr. Paterson has viewed the rally foremost as a neighborhood tumult, almost a personal responsibility. 
 While others focus on the virulence of the rally's organizer, Khallid Abdul Muhammad, Mr. Paterson has been more concerned about the neighbors and constituents whose children will be drawn to the event, whose sidewalks will be overrun, whose images will be broadcast for the delectation of the outside world.
And so he has tried to be a broker amid the publicity churn, dispensing with Mr. Muhammad as a destructive hater while urging City Hall to recognize the concerns of those who plan to attend the rally and tone down the condemnations in the interest of public safety. For this, he has earned the disdain of Mr. Muhammad and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, both of whom have accused him and other elected leaders of equivocating instead of taking a strong stand for or against a rally that organizers are billing as a Million Youth March. But he gently rejects the idea that one must take such doctrinaire positions, preferring a nuanced approach born not just of political necessity but also of singular experience.
"In spite of some of the problems I've had in my life, I think it's given me a unique perspective, a different way of looking at the world than other people," he said. "I think that's why I can condemn the hate language associated with the rally, but understand the anger and the disenfranchised feeling that makes African-Americans unable to denounce a person who's doing that."
His personal prism, he says, is the result of being the son of Basil A. Paterson, the former State Senator and Deputy Mayor, while feeling inadequate to enter his father's elite political world because he was born with no sight in his left eye and severely limited vision in his right. Even as he struggled to overcome those feelings, he found himself repelled by the racism he saw among some advocates for the disabled, and by the bias among black leaders against people with disabilities.
And so he moves between worlds, understanding but not subscribing to anyone's orthodoxy, freely taking positions unthinkable to his father's generation but never fully straying from the insider's political path.
THOUGH a political product of the city's mainline Democratic organization, Mr. Paterson, who is 44, says his party's inflexibility and lack of creativity have driven away vast constituencies. He is starting to see the merit in such ideas as charter schools and voucher systems. And as much as he criticizes Mr. Giuliani for raising the temperature of the rally and failing to address the longstanding concerns of black residents, he praises the Mayor for his law enforcement achievements and for the city's economic rebound.
"When you criticize everything somebody does, and find a way to diminish any achievement of another person or mayor, you marginalize yourself," he said. "The public believes you're just reacting, that you've succumbed to anger or hostility based on previous events. Whether I like the outcome of the mayoral election in 1993, I was elected by my constituents to bring back the greatest resources to my community. I will work with anybody, because my community is under siege."
His flexibility and his thoughtful explanations of his political positions have made him an important black leader, with influence far beyond his essentially powerless position as a Democrat in the Republican-controlled State Senate.
"David is very much a bridge between young people and his father's generation, and that's something important that's been missing in this city," said Bill Lynch, the former Deputy Mayor and strategist, who was Mayor David N. Dinkins's longtime adviser. "He has the credibility among both groups to say things that other people can't say, like challenging the messenger on this march without looking like he's doing it under somebody's guidance."
Mr. Paterson can see enough to play a decent game of basketball, raise two children with his wife, Michelle, and make his way without a cane. He entered politics after Hofstra Law School at the urging of his father's friends, believing he had to pretend that being legally blind was not an impediment, and until a few years ago he could barely talk about his eyesight. But he finally decided he was more comfortable admitting there were certain things he could not do, joining the community of the disabled and even making jokes on the subject.
Though he seems more comfortable within himself now, proud of his role mediating various racially tinged disputes over the last several years, he has yet to make the move that would propel him into the first rank of the city's political leadership. He has twice tried to escape the deadening frustration of the Senate, but for transitional jobs that he did not win: Public Advocate in 1993, and Manhattan Borough President last year. His friends have urged him to go for something more substantive the next time, and to begin organizing soon. He's thinking about it.
"One thing you learn in my position," he said. "You don't evolve unless you take a chance."

3 Options for Russia: Populist Path Seems Most Likely but Dangerous

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
Plan A, a $23.6 billion program courtesy of the International Monetary Fund, failed in less than four weeks. Plan B, a devaluation and debt moratorium cobbled together by young Russian reformers, collapsed within days. Neither prevented investors from fleeing or citizens from turning every ruble they have into dollars.
Now, Russia's central bank is nearly out of dollars, its banks are out of cash, and its Government is not just in de facto default on its loans, but for most practical purposes, defunct. And those who have ridden to Russia's rescue before -- the I.M.F., the United States, the Group of Seven industrialized democracies -- are ruling out a bailout. 
 So what options are left for restoring financial stability?
Even as Russia struggles to form a new coalition Government, some prominent Western economists are considering measures that would have been dismissed as extremist a few weeks ago.
Economists outline three possible courses of action for Moscow: Take the populist path of tightening direct control over the economy, including foreign-exchange controls that would make it difficult to convert the ruble into dollars or German marks. Or strike a deal with the I.M.F., paying at least lip service to tight money, budget balancing and orderly debt-restructuring. Or, most radically, link the nation's finances to a strong foreign currency like the dollar.
The last two proposals, both intended to preserve Russian access to foreign capital, could be pursued at the same time.
The trouble is that the choice Russia seems to be leaning toward -- the populist package -- seems the most likely to lead to hyperinflation, social unrest and a lurch toward nationalism -- or worse. Even the usually circumspect I.M.F. managing director, Michel Camdessus, warned that the populist scenario "would lead to disaster."
Consider that option first. Communists in Parliament are talking about a full retreat from a market economy, including nationalizing banks to protect depositors, renationalizing major industries to raise output and Government revenue and instituting price controls to protect the ruble and dampen inflation -- all to bring a sense of order to daily living.
The linchpin of their plan involves foreign-exchange controls that would ban dollar-denominated bank accounts abroad and force exporters to sell their foreign currency to the central bank at a fixed rate. The hope is that by making it impossible to buy dollars, the Russians could stem capital flight and stabilize the ruble.
Although most Western economists deplore exchange controls as authoritarian and prone to abuse, some believe that they may be the lesser of evils right now. "The foreign exchange must be closed," said Padma Desai, a professor of Russian studies at Columbia University and a proponent of gradual economic reform in Russia.
Others disagree. Paul R. Krugman, an international economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who recently wrote an article for Fortune magazine advocating exchange controls in several Asian nations, thinks that they would fail in Russia. In his view, Russia's oligarchs -- the tycoons who control the biggest banks and businesses -- would easily circumvent them. "If having dollars is criminal, only criminals will have dollars," he said.
There are other problems. Foreign-exchange controls risk triggering inflation by giving Russia's central bank a free hand to print more rubles. At best, the Government could keep inflation at bay with Soviet-style shortages and rationing.
Moreover, a heavy dose of state intervention would fuel capital flight and scare off foreign investors. And it would certainly cost Russia the rest of the $22.6 billion I.M.F. loan package announced in July. Exchange controls violate the I.M.F. charter.
A second alternative would be a modified version of the fund's program. That would please Washington, which contends that if Russia would just push ahead with the tax, banking and other economic reforms stipulated by the I.M.F. to restore confidence in the ruble, the West would be willing to lend more money. This is essentially the message that President Clinton is bringing to his meeting with President Boris N. Yeltsin in Moscow this week.
There is just one problem. This hope-for-the-best approach flies in the face of political reality as it has unfolded since Mr. Yeltsin changed his Prime Minister, replacing Sergei V. Kiriyenko, an advocate of economic reform, with the more conservative Viktor S. Chernomyrdin.
"The only way the Russians can get international financing is if they cut their budget deficit," said Anders Aslund, an economist at the Carnegie Endowment for Peace and an adviser to the Russian Government in the early 1990's. The only way to balance the Russian budget quickly is to transfer revenue from the regional governments, which spend huge sums to prop up money-losing banks and industries, to the central Government, Mr. Aslund said. But, he said, "Chernomyrdin was brought in to make sure that the banks were bailed out, that regional governments weren't put under pressure and that barter can survive."
What really stands in the way of fiscal reform is Russia's failure to develop a separate Government budget, central bank and private sector. "There's one common pot, one budget, one credit card which is more or less used for all transactions," said Alvin Rabushka, an economist at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, a public-policy research group. "In Russia, all losses and debts are passed back to the federal budget and the central bank."
That is why money from abroad is probably not the answer. Any cash the I.M.F. pumps into Russia has been lent by the central bank to banks that promptly exchange rubles for dollars. Such assistance just increases the pressure on the ruble and capital flight.
A third option for Russia, admittedly a desperate one, would be to give up all pretense of trying to control the value of its currency by linking the ruble tightly to a hard currency like the dollar and in effect replacing its central bank with a currency board. Under such an arrangement, the supply of rubles in circulation would have to be fully backed by dollars and convertible, on demand, at a fixed rate of exchange. In effect, Russia would be handing over control of its money supply -- which would fluctuate with the amount of dollars available -- to the Federal Reserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan.
Until recently considered an appropriate strategy only for small economies that rely heavily on international trade, the currency-board proposal is gaining supporters among prominent Western experts ranging from Mr. Camdessus to Mr. Aslund and Domingo Cavallo, a former Economics Minister of Argentina.
Rudiger Dornbusch, an international economist at M.I.T., is a recent convert. "What might have been a good idea for Indonesia is a far better one in Russia, where the economy has already been dollarized, just as Argentina's was in 1992," he said. "It's the right cure for a crazy Duma and a lunatic President."
But even Steven Hanke, a professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University and a long-time advocate of a currency board for Russia and other "emerging" economies like Argentina and Indonesia, says Russia is in too much turmoil to create a currency board immediately. As an interim measure, he suggests that Russia make the dollar legal tender -- as it was de facto until 1997 -- alongside the ruble.
After all, legally or not, Russians already hold more dollars than rubles, or $40 billion versus just $8.6 billion of their own depreciated currency.
"Russia needs a quick fix," Mr. Hanke said.
Temporarily making the dollar Russia's main currency might produce an injection of fresh financing, without the inflation that excessive money creation would set off. Right now, most Russians' dollars are squirreled away in foreign bank accounts or under mattresses and are not recirculated by domestic banks for use by cash-starved enterprises that need to pay workers or buy raw material.
No short-term measures can address Russia's bedrock problems -- the lack of a functional banking system, of truly private enterprises and of the rule of law. But Mr. Hanke said: "The ship is sinking, and they're trying to save passengers. They're not worrying right now about getting them to shore."

HEADLINE: TELEVISION REVIEW;
Rural Life Has Room For Angst

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN 

 BODY:
Beneath the picture-postcard scenes of pastoral America, writers, at least since Sherwood Anderson and Edgar Lee Masters, have discerned a depressing reality: Things are not as they seem amid the foliage. Tomorrow night, a television documentary maker confirms that civilization's discontents do not spare an upstate New York community despite the beauties of a snowy winter and the childhood frolickings of summer.
In "Cayutaville," Diana Crone Frank trains her camera mainly on two families, the Chapmans and the Soules, and finds plenty of angst. Theirs is a Christian community, centered around faith and church, but these prove frail defenses against early death, heroin addiction, economic buffetings and family breakups. Shunning narration, she lets parents and children tell their own, mostly melancholy stories. 
 Particular attention is given to the most dire cases: Robert Chapman, father of three, who is unable to shake off his grief over a daughter's death years ago at the age of 10, and one of the Soule sons, Robert, who passed much of his life cut off from his parents and in a heroin haze. (Robert has since died.)
Cayutaville is not prospering, and neither family is awash in money. Mr. Chapman has resigned his teaching job for reasons not made clear; the beautiful old Chapman home has been mortgaged. Robert Chapman's attention to tending his daughter's grave seems obsessive and plays into the breakup of his marriage. A daughter says her mother has finally "gotten out from under his thumb," but it is he who seems liberated.
Mr. Soule, retired from his job as a guard at a youth camp, apparently carried his authoritarian style into his home and may have contributed to his addict son's sense of failure. But his other children seem content to raise their own families not far from home in jobs that are guaranteed not to make them rich.
Despite intimations of guilt, blame, responsibility, Ms. Frank sensibly stays clear of judgments of what went wrong. Instead she returns to church meetings where some of the family members find consolation for their disappointments in the warmth of community and the security, despite everything, of small-town living.

HEADLINE: Orders to Factories Climbed 1.2% in July

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 2

 BODY:
New orders flowed into United States factories at the strongest clip in eight months in July, the Government said today, emphasizing the industrial sector's vigor in the face of the July strikes at General Motors.
Despite recessions in Asia, which are steadily pinching export sales. as well as the idled plants at G.M., the largest auto maker, and its suppliers, orders grew 1.2 percent, to a seasonally adjusted $335.2 billion in July. 
 That was the biggest monthly rise since a 2.3 percent surge last November and much stronger than June's slight gain of three-tenths of 1 percent. Excluding transportation goods like new cars, orders were up even more strongly -- by 1.4 percent in June and also in July.
Maureen Maitland, an economist for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities in New York, noted that the July factory orders report showed a 1.8 percent drop in orders for capital goods, excluding military items and aircraft. The category is a barometer of businesses' plans for expanding plant and equipment.
"Over all, the data suggest that Asia is impacting the manufacturing sector very gradually," Ms. Maitland said.
Shipments of finished manufactured products fell in July -- the third decline in four months -- by a tenth of a percent, to $334.9 billion. There was a big drop in shipments of primary metals from June and of transportation products, and no change at all in July for electrical equipment or industrial machinery.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Treasury Prices Mostly Dip as Financial Turmoil Eases

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of most Treasury securities slipped slightly yesterday, as stock markets worldwide stabilized and the dollar weakened in currency trading, lessening the flight into Government securities that has been an almost daily occurrence lately.
Late in the day, however, the 30-year Treasury bond rose 3/32, to a price of 102 17/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, slipped to 5.33 percent, from 5.34 percent the day before. 
 With yields at a 30-year low, the lure for some investors is not as strong as it was a few months ago.
Stephanie M. Davis, senior technical analyst at Thomson Global Markets in Boston, said, "Essentially, the markets are all due for some corrective activity," which, she added, could come on Friday, when the Labor Department reports the nonfarm payroll number for August.
"An aggressive 350,000 gain or more will probably knock bonds for a loop, sending prices lower and yields higher," she said, particularly if the dollar continues to weaken. "The next bond trade is apt to be down," she said, adding that the "price has come too far too fast."
The range of economists' forecasts goes from 205,000 new jobs to 430,000. Thomson Global Markets is looking for a rise of 325,000, which is slightly lower than the consensus, but still on the high side.
Hugh Whelan, vice president and portfolio manager at Aeltus Investment Management, is also cautious on bond prices. He urged investors not to try to rationalize current low yields on economic grounds. While Treasuries may have become a symbol of safety for speculators and day traders, he said, "long-term investors must be able to square bond prices with economic reality."
Despite investors' many worries about the effects of weaker foreign economies on this country, factory orders in July rose by a strong 1.2 percent, the Commerce Department reported yesterday.
Mr. Whelan cautioned that Treasury securities, having priced in a 50-basis-point drop in rates, already reflected a lot of the good news. "In fact, with the admission that economic data lag, there is no proof yet of a dramatic slowing in the U.S. economy," he said. "Current data suggest that third-quarter G.D.P. growth is likely to be 2.5 percent to 3 percent, not 1 percent."

Market Frailty Isn't Mexican, Official Says

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Sept. 2

 BODY:
Finance Minister Jose Angel Gurria runs an economy that is growing vigorously, with most exports surging and thousands of new jobs opening every day. But ask him whether the Mexican stock market will rise or plunge tomorrow and he shakes his head in bewilderment.
"Ask the Duma; ask Mr. Chernomyrdin," Mr. Gurria said in an interview today, referring to President Boris N. Yeltsin's embattled choice for Prime Minister and the house of the Russian Parliament that has so far refused to approve him. 
 "It has nothing to do with Mexico," he said. "That is what is very dramatic. Sometimes there is this feeling that there's not very much you can do. Basically, you are in the presence of forces you can't control."
Mr. Gurria vented frustration felt by leaders of several Latin American countries -- including Brazil, Chile and Argentina -- that took tough, often unpopular measures in recent years to stabilize their economies but have been dragged into the global market turmoil nonetheless.
"There is a lack of differentiation," Mr. Gurria said, lamenting that international investors had sold Latin securities in response to worries generated by Russia and Japan, without bothering to examine conditions in individual nations of the region.
Today, Latin American markets again showed that they are tied to trading in the United States as several of them rose or held steady, a day after Tuesday's rebound in the Dow Jones industrial average. (The Dow fell 45 points today after rising 288 on Tuesday.)
In Mexico, where there was no trading on Tuesday because of President Ernesto Zedillo's State of the Union address, the stock market rose today by 186.63 points, or 6.24 percent. Mexican stocks had dropped 5.14 percent Monday.
The Latin market performance came in spite of a controlled devaluation overnight Tuesday in Colombia. The authorities there widened the daily exchange rate band for the Colombian peso by 9 percent, saying they would allow it to depreciate 23 percent annually against the United States dollar, compared with 14 percent before.
Colombia had spent about $1 billion of its foreign reserves this year to shore up its currency, which was weakened by a budget deficit equivalent to about 6 percent of the gross domestic product. A new President, Andres Pastrana, took office there on Aug. 7.
Analysts said Colombia devalued anticipating a similar move in neighboring Venezuela, where economists say the bolivar is overvalued by as much as 40 percent. But Venezuela weathered the storm today, with its stock market closing up 3.82 percent. The bolivar was barely lower.
Mr. Gurria, who spoke in English, said that beneath wavering Mexican markets lay a sound economy that expanded 5.4 percent in the first half of this year. Despite a big drop in petroleum prices, the Mexican Government, which relies on oil for a third of its revenue, posted a small surplus for the first half of the year.
Mexico's foreign debt, the Finance Minister said, would remain well under control even if international markets were unsteady into next year. Mexico easily refinanced $4.5 billion in capital payments it owed this year, and those due in 1999 are smaller, at $1.4 billion.
Mr. Gurria said he was concerned that prolonged high interest rates could deal new blows to the Mexican banking system. Earlier this week, annual rates on overnight Treasury bills went to 38 percent. But so far, no bank collapses are looming, he said.
And he declared that threats to financial stability from outside the country were giving fractious lawmakers reasons to settle their differences over a proposed multibillion-dollar bank bailout.
"There is a growing awareness by all parties that we can't play games here, that if you stretch the rubber band a bit too far, it could snap," Mr. Gurria said. The bank bailout debate, in which the opposition has accused the Government of rescuing wealthy friends and colleagues at the expense of Mexican taxpayers, has dragged on since March.
Returning to the global economy and finances, Mr. Gurria said: "What worries me is who is running this show. There is an enormous vacuum of leadership worldwide. Where are the consensus-building and decision-making mechanisms to face situations like Russia and Japan? And how do you reward countries that perform well, like ours?"
He defended the $50 billion international rescue effort that saved Mexico from financial collapse in 1995. At a meeting of Latin finance ministers called for Friday by the International Monetary Fund, he plans to urge the I.M.F. and the advanced economies to once again come to the aid of Russia.
"There is a problem of contagion to the rest of the world's economy," Mr. Gurria said. "You're talking about a country which may qualify as too big to fail."

HEADLINE: American-Style Pay Moves Abroad;
Importance of Stock Options Expands in a Global Economy

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Rose Gerrit Huy was a fast-rising executive at Daimler-Benz A.G., the German industrial giant that makes Mercedes-Benz automobiles. A Harvard-educated economist, she was in charge of developing cars like the SLK roadster before she was promoted to head the company's finance and telecommunications subsidiary.
But last year, Ms. Huy, 43, quit Daimler after 11 years to become the Compaq Computer Corporation's managing director in Germany. Not that her Daimler salary was skimpy, but the Texas computer maker offered something that could catapult her into vastly greater riches: stock options.
Ms. Huy would not disclose the size of the options package that lured her away, but these numbers surely provide a clue: While the chairman of Daimler holds a form of options worth less than $1 million, the options of the Compaq chairman are worth more than $188 million at last count. 
 For the last two decades, even as the global economy has demolished national barriers to trade and investment, the executive pay gap between America and the rest of the world has widened dramatically. While American executives were loading up with stock options, restricted stock and other compensation intended to align their interests with those of shareholders, their counterparts overseas continued to collect only salary and modest bonuses.
That is largely because the political cultures of many European and Asian countries recoiled at the idea of lavishing vast riches on capitalist chieftains for a single year's work. Pay packages like the $49.9 million that Sanford I. Weill, the chairman of Travelers Group Inc., collected in 1997, or the more than $556 million that Michael D. Eisner, the chairman of the Walt Disney Company, made in 1997 by exercising fewer than half of his stock options left many people in Europe aghast.
Now, though, that attitude is changing, albeit slowly. To stem a drain of executive talent to their American rivals, big European and Asian corporations have begun pressing their governments to modify securities laws and accounting practices that discourage jumbo pay packages.
"The rest of the world is moving to our pay model," said Kevin J. Murphy, a University of Southern California finance professor and a leading expert on worldwide executive pay. "Maybe that movement is out of efficiency, maybe it is out of greed -- we don't know which yet -- but the trend is clear."
Last year, for example, Japan revised its commercial code to allow stock options. Already, 160 companies, including Sony, the entertainment and electronics concern, have adopted option plans, according to Bob Buford, a compensation specialist with the consulting firm Towers-Perrin in New York, who has worked with many Japanese companies.
The invasion of American-style pay plans, including stock options, is uneven in Europe, specialists say: faster in high technology, like telecommunications and software, and slower in manufacturing and heavy industry. But it is having a big impact wherever it is found, and the recent turmoil in global stock markets, although it may have cut the value of some compensation packages, is unlikely to have any long-term effect on equity-based pay.
In France, the Netherlands and Australia, a few companies have started adding options and other forms of equity to executive compensation packages, a practice that the British began widely adopting in the early 1980's.
In Germany, a court upheld a form of stock options last month that Daimler offered two years ago to 170 executives, a pool it has since expanded tenfold, while also increasing the size of its still-modest option packages.
Wolfgang Doell, a partner in Frankfurt with the executive-search firm Heidrick & Struggles, said that two years ago the Ford Motor Company extended its American pay levels to its operations in Europe, and immediately lured two top executives from Volkswagen. Ford is now fishing for lower-level managers using the same bait -- stock options -- and this has increased the pressure on the German auto industry, one of the slowest areas of German business to adjust, he said.
"The world is now moving to the U.S. model because it works very well for shareholders," Steven N. Kaplan, a finance professor at the University of Chicago, said.
Stock options give the holder the right to buy shares at a given price over a specified period, usually 10 years. If the stock surges, the holder can exercise the option, sell the stock at a much higher price and pocket the difference.
Even in America, where it is the most widespread, the practice is controversial, especially when poor-performing executives walk away with multimillion-dollar payoffs either because their stock has been held aloft by the bull market or because the exercise price has been reset downward.
Despite all the criticism, other countries are embracing the practice. In London, Paul Hodgson, an editor at Income Data Services, which tracks executive compensation at British companies, said that the "only difference is in the size of pay, not the components, which are going toward the U.S. style."
While options in Britain have tended to be modest, Unilever P.L.C., the British-Dutch household-products maker, and Marks & Spencer P.L.C., Britain's largest retailer, are moving toward American-style mega-grants.
Some companies, including SmithKline Beecham P.L.C., the drug concern with major operations in London and Philadelphia, and Four Seasons Hotels and Hilton International, a unit of Ladbroke Group P.L.C., the multinational lodging companies, have made all or parts of their compensation packages identical regardless of where an executive is stationed.
Compensation experts call such plans "global pay." Translation: pay on an American scale.
These experts say global pay eliminates internal tensions that arise when, say, the home office executives in Brussels or Osaka make less than their subordinates in Chicago or Los Angeles.
The disparity in pay between American companies and the rest of the world came into sharp focus in May, when Daimler agreed to acquire the Chrysler Corporation, whose No. 2 executive made more last year from salary, bonus and cashing-in options than the top 10 Daimler executives combined.
Both Daimler and Chrysler have told shareholders that the new DaimlerChrysler will have separate pay plans for executives in Stuttgart and in Detroit, an indication that it does not plan to quickly equalize pay.
Robert Eaton, the Chrysler chief executive, predicted that the highest German and American executives at DaimlerChrysler would someday be paid similarly. "We have to be competitive, and over some extended period of time, I would see for that group the compensation coming together," Mr. Eaton said.
Ira T. Kay, a partner in New York with Watson Wyatt Worldwide, said that in recent years, foreign owners have begun to adopt long-term incentive pay, including small grants of options, which he saw as signs of how foreign-owned companies were moving closer to American-style pay. By paying executives with equity, American companies have performed better than those overseas, Mr. Kay argues in his book "CEO Pay and Shareholder Value: Helping the U.S. Win the Global Economic War" (St. Lucie Press, 1998).
Gareth R. Williams, an international pay expert in the Chicago office of William M. Mercer, the consulting firm, said that in five years or so there would be many "global executives who will not be hamstrung by their location" and who would earn global pay that is heavily dependent on stock options and other forms of equity-based rewards.
The trend to raising the compensation of executives at multinational companies to the levels in the United States has encountered all sorts of opposition -- even from the very executives who stand to benefit from it. Alan Johnson, a compensation consultant in New York, said many European and Asian executives he has worked with showed an obvious distaste for huge options payouts. "I have been surprised that it is not just a legal, wake-up-and-smell-the-money issue," Mr. Johnson said, "but it is deeply rooted in their culture and views that you just don't seek unlimited money."
On a trip to the United States, the chief executive of Commerzbank, Martin Kohlhaussen, stunned an American banker recently when he said he owned no Commerzbank stocks. "What makes you tick?" was the American banker's response. Ulrich Ramm, Commerzbank's chief economist, said Europe was moving toward American-style pay, but added: "It's done here with more sensitivity than in the United States, with all the exaggerations there. Here you try to spread it a little more broadly."
Mr. Johnson predicted that like Daimler "most companies will change in baby steps." He added, "It will take a decade or so to get like the U.S."
One reason for the slow pace, in the view of John England, a Towers Perrin executive-compensation specialist in Brussels, is the greater responsiveness of European companies to stockholder concerns. When Daimler's original options plan for its executives came under attack from an investor, for example, Mr. England said that Daimler modified its option grants. "You never see a U.S. company do that," he said.
Europe's high income-tax rates can make perks like cars, chauffeurs, gardeners and lifelong health benefits as big a draw as options. And European tax laws discourage companies from making bountiful options awards by treating them as a cost on the corporate balance sheet rather than as a deduction on their taxes. As a result, European stock-incentive plans are often watered-down versions of their American counterparts. What Daimler calls "options," for example, are more like what Americans call convertible debentures.
Under the Daimler plan, executives use after-tax money to buy securities that pay about 4.4 percent interest for 10 years and give the right to convert to stock at a fixed price once the shares have risen 15 percent. The plan limits the 170 top executives to a $120,000 investment a year, pocket change for American chief executives, while senior managers can invest only $30,000 annually.
Brian Foley, an executive compensation lawyer in White Plains, said that requiring executives to buy into their equity, what he called "putting some skin in the game," might lower resistance to American-style pay plans in Europe and Japan.
"Buy one, get two sounds a lot better than giving something" away free, as most American stock-option plans do, he said.
Graef Crystal, the editor of an executive-compensation newsletter who once designed executive pay plans, took a more jaundiced view.
"The virus," he said, "is now spreading around the world."

GRAPHIC: Graph: "Shares Make All the Difference"
American executives typically earn much more than their counterports abroad. With base salaries relatively equal, the difference is almost entirely due to stock options. Britain has been adding stock options and other forms of equity to executive pay, but is still far behind the United States. Graph compares the median compensation for C.E.O.'s of large companies in the U.S. and in Britain during 1997. Figures are broken down into the following categories: salary, bonus, value of shares held, and unrealized options.

HEADLINE: THE MARKET TURMOIL: RUSSIA'S IMPACT;
Quick Action by U.S. Banks Limits Damage

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
Although the Chase Manhattan Corporation and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette joined the chorus of financial services companies announcing losses on their business in Russia yesterday, investors may soon be able to breathe more easily about the Russian impact.
The extent of American banks' exposure to Russia, analysts say, pales in comparison with the hits taken as a result of the Latin American debt crisis in the 1980's. And quick action by several American financial institutions in recent days to mark down their possible losses by as much as 85 percent should limit the damage to their bottom line, analysts said. 
 "It's a bad quarter," said Carla D'Arista, a managing director and banking analyst at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Company in Arlington, Va. But, she added, "It's in no way meaningfully derailed the fundamentals of the largest U.S. banks."
Chase Manhattan said yesterday that it expected to take a $200 million charge in the third quarter, primarily for losses in Russia and Asia. Its direct Russian exposure was about $250 million, with the bulk of that, about $140 million, related to commercial banking activities, it said.
Exposure to institutional investors and investment funds collateralized by ruble-denominated Russian Treasury securities was about $210 million, Chase said, with the majority of this exposure backed by "significant" non-Russian assets.
The bank also reported trading revenues for July and August of approximately $160 million. Analysts said that was a significant drop from average monthly trading revenues of about $200 million.
"We believe we have captured most of what can be the impact of Russia," said Dina Dublon, Chase's executive vice president and treasurer.
Chase, which has an inventory of about $50 million of Russian securities remaining, still expects to post "substantial" earnings in the third quarter, Ms. Dublon said.
Yesterday, Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette said that it earned about $40 million before taxes during the first two months of the third quarter, after taking into account losses in Russia. A spokeswoman declined to be more specific.
Dresdner Bank A.G., Germany's third-largest bank, said yesterday that its unsecured credit exposure to Russia totaled 1 billion marks, ($571 million), bringing the total for the big four German banks to less than 4 billion marks of unsecured lending. Dresdner Bank has already made provisions to cover about 60 percent of its Russian loan exposure. Recently, Commerzbank A.G. has reported 1 billion marks in exposure; Deutsche Bank A.G. said it had 1.35 billion marks, and Bayerische Hypo-und Vereinsbank A.G. 500 million.
Earlier this week, Citicorp, Bankers Trust, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Barclays and Nomura Securities also reported heavy losses on Russian business. Among the largest were those of Salomon Smith Barney and Bankers Trust. Salomon, a unit of the Travelers Group, said it had lost an estimated $360 million after taxes in its arbitrage and Russian-related credits businesses, while Bankers Trust put its pretax trading loss at $350 million.
But the State Street Bank Corporation in Boston said yesterday that recent events in Russia, Asia and Latin America had had no significant impact on its revenue and earnings.
Last week the BankBoston Corporation said that it lost $30 million this quarter in United States and international trading, including $10 million in Russia. BankAmerica, and J. P. Morgan also reported trading losses.
Despite their Russian exposure, most banks, with the exception of Bankers Trust, should report positive earnings for the third quarter and see minimal impact in 1999, said Thomas H. Hanley, a managing director at Warburg Dillon Read.
"The banks have thrown in the kitchen sink in the third quarter," he said. "They faced up to the problem this time immediately."
In the first quarter of 1998, foreign bank lending to Russia totaled about $61.4 billion, according to the Bank for International Settlements.
German bank exposure equals about one-half of that, Mr. Hanley said.
Over all, major American money center banks have about $1.6 billion of pretax losses from Russia, Mr. Hanley estimates. Prior to the Russian crisis, the banks' total exposure was about $6.4 billion. Pretax losses and withdrawn lines of credit have reduced their net exposure to about $3.3 billion, he said, a modest percentage of the banks' total capital of about $92 billion and their total reserves of $15.9 billion.
In comparison, at the height of the Latin American debt crisis in 1984, loans from money center banks totaled about $58.5 billion, outpacing the banks' total capital of $26.7 billion and reserves of $4.1 billion, according to a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation report.
Banks needed several years to recover from the losses, Mr. Hanley said.

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN MOSCOW;
Excerpts From Clinton and Yeltsin Remarks: 'Peace and Stability'

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the joint news conference of President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia in Moscow yesterday, as provided by the White House:
 
OPENING STATEMENT
By President Yeltsin
Distinguished ladies and gentlemen, the official visit of the President of the United States Bill Clinton to Russia is coming to an end. We have had intensive, productive negotiations. We have managed to discuss a wide range of topical issues. I would like to emphasize the exchanges were sincere and keen. The dialogue was marked by the spirit of mutual understanding. 
 Responsibility of our two countries for maintaining and strengthening peace and stability is obvious. That is why we have paid special attention to the discussion of the entire spectrum of security issues in the world.
The discussion has included the implementation of international and bilateral treaties and agreements concerning the weapons of mass destruction, as well as the elaboration of common approaches to dealing with the threat of nuclear weapons proliferation and their delivery means.
Unfortunately, this is not the only major task that humanity struggles to resolve. That is why President Clinton and I have discussed global threats and challenges. Our positions on this issue have coincided and this closeness of approaches is reflected in the joint statement on common security changes on the threshold of the 21st century. I consider this document to be a significant step toward strengthening strategic partnership between Russia and the United States.
We have also had substantial talks on the most topical international issues. And there are quite a few such issues. I'll put it frankly; here our approaches have not always completely coincided. Russia rejects the use of power methods as a matter of principle. Conflicts of today have no military solutions, be it in Kosovo or around Iraq or Afghanistan or others. Also we do not accept the NATO centrism idea for the new European security architecture. Nevertheless, our talks have been conducive to greater mutual understanding on these issues.
Of course, we could not do without discussing economy problems. Current dimensions of our economic relations should be brought up to a qualitatively new level. We shall have to suffer through much blood, sweat and tears before new forms of business cooperation worthy of our two great powers are found, reforms that would be able to withstand volatile circumstances. There exist quite a few opportunities for this. These are mentioned in our joint statement on economic issues.
In conclusion, I would like to say -- and I hope Bill will agree with me -- the summit was a success. . . .
 
OPENING STATEMENT
By President Clinton
Thank you very much, Mr. President, for your hospitality and for giving Hillary and me and our team the chance to come to Moscow again.
Over the past five years, I have been in this great, historic city in times of bright hope and times of uncertainty. But throughout I have witnessed the remarkable transformation of this nation to democracy, to a more open economy. We all know that this meeting comes at a challenging time for the Russian people. But I don't believe anyone could ever have doubted that there would be obstacles on Russia's road to a vibrant economy and a strong democracy. I don't -- also believe that anyone can seriously doubt the determination of the Russian people to build a brighter, better, stronger future.
Russia is important to America. Our economies are connected; we share values, interests and friendship. We share security interests and heavy security responsibilities. In our discussions, President Yeltsin and I spoke about Russia's options for stabilizing its economy and restoring confidence. I reaffirmed America's strong view that Russia can move beyond today's crisis and create growth and good jobs, but only if it carries forward with its transformation, with a strong and fair tax system, greater rule of law, dealing forthrightly with financial institutions, having regulations that protect against abuses; and yes, developing an appropriate safety net for people who are hurt during times of change.
President Yeltsin reaffirmed his commitment to reform. And I believe that is the right commitment. The answer to the present difficulties is to finish the job that has been begun, not to stop it in midstream or to reverse course. This is a view I will reaffirm when I meet today with leaders of the Duma and the Federation Council. America and the international community are, I am convinced, ready to offer assistance if Russia stays with the path of reform.
We discussed also at length common security concerns. . . .
 
Arms Export Controls
In recent months Russia has taken important steps to tighten its export controls on weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to deliver them, and to penalize offenders.
This week, Russia barred three companies from transactions with Iran. Today, we agreed to intensify our cooperation by creating seven working groups on export controls to further strengthen Russia's ability to halt the spread of dangerous weapons. Also, we renewed our commitment to persuade India and Pakistan to reverse their arms race. And we pledged to accelerate international negotiation to establish a tough inspection regime of the Biological Weapons Convention. I don't believe it's possible to overstate the importance of this initiative for the next 20 years. . . .
Russia and the United States share a commitment to combat terrorism. We agree that there is no possible justification for terrorism; it is murder plain and simple. . . .
Finally, we discussed our common foreign policy agenda, including, first and foremost, the need to continue to strengthen the peace in Bosnia and to look for a peaceful solution in Kosovo, where the humanitarian situation is now quite grave. We agreed that the Serbian government must stop all repressive actions against civilian populations, allow the relief organizations immediate and full access to those in need, and pursue an interim settlement.
 
Sanctions on Iraq
President Yeltsin and I also agree that Iraq must comply fully with all relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions imposed after the gulf war, and in particular, must agree to allow the international weapons inspectors to again pursue their mission without obstruction or delay. Far from advancing the day sanctions are lifted, Iraq's most recent efforts to undermine the inspectors will perpetuate sanctions, prevent Iraq from acquiring the resources it needs to rebuild its military and keep Iraq's economy under tight international control. . . .
This has been a full agenda, a productive summit. . . .
 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Q. My first question is, before you met, a lot of politicians, a lot of the public believed your meeting would not be needed . . .So what was the psychological atmosphere during your talks? . . . And second, are Russia and the U.S., partners right now, or still contenders? And today, bidding farewell, Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton, are they still friends?
MR. YELTSIN: I will start with your last question. Yes, we stay friends and the atmosphere since the beginning of the talks until the end was a friendly one. I would say it was very considerate and there were no discontents during the talks that we had.
And this brings my conclusion that since we did not have any differences, in my opinion, there will be no differences also in our activities, in what we do bilaterally. Of course, that goes without saying. This is very logical.
Now, in response to those skeptical observers who alleged, and continue to do so, that they don't believe, I've been always saying, no, on the contrary -- we need to repeat it -- we do believe we do that in order to remove the tension, and each time, having those meetings, we've been able to do something to alleviate the tension. This is what really matters. We've been doing that, removing the tension. And this time again we have removed part of the tension one more time.
MR. CLINTON: Well, first of all, I think it's important to answer your question of what happened from the point of view of the Russian people and then from the point of view of the American people.
You ask if we're still friends. The answer to that is yes. You ask if Russia and the United States have a partnership. I think the plain answer to that is, yes, even though we don't always agree on every issue. I can tell you from my point of view, this was a successful meeting on the national security issues, because I think establishing this early warning information sharing is important and I know that the destruction of this huge volume of plutonium is important. And it also might be important to the Russian economy. It can be a plus as well as a national security plus.
Now, on the domestic economic issues, from the point of view of America, it was important for me to come here just to say to the President and to his team and to the Duma leaders I will see later and the Federation Council leaders that I know this is a difficult time, but there is no shortcut to developing a system that will have the confidence of investors around the world. These are not American rules or anybody else's rules. These are -- in a global economy, you have to be able to get money in from outside your country and keep the money in your country invested in your country.
And if the reform process can be completed, then I for one would be strongly supportive of greater assistance to Russia from the United States and the other big economic powers, because I think we have a very strong vested interest in seeing this economically successful Russia and that is a full partner across the whole range of issues in the world. I also think it's good for preserving Russia's democracy and freedom. . .
MR. YELTSIN: I would like to add just a moment, just two words here. We have put it on paper. We have decided to set up on the territory of Russia a joint center of control over the missile launches. For the first time this has been done. This is exceptionally important.
 
Economic Perils
Q. President Yeltsin, yesterday President Clinton spoke of the painful steps that Russia will have to take and the need to play by the rules of international economics. What difficult steps are you prepared to take?
. . . And to President Clinton, the world stock markets seem very fragile right now. How can the United States withstand all these outside pressures?
MR. CLINTON: I think the answer to your question about what we can do that's best for our economy is really twofold. The first thing we have to do is to do our very best to make the right decisions at home. You know, we have to stay with the path of discipline that has brought us this far in the last 5 1/2 years, and we have to make the investments and decisions that we know will produce growth over the long-run for the American economy. Whether it's in education, or science and technology, we have to do the things that send a signal that we understand how the world economy works and we intend to do well in it. But the most important thing is sticking with sound economic policy.
Now, in addition to that, it is important that more and more Americans, without regard to party, understand that we are in a global economy and it's been very good to the United States over the last 5 1/2 years -- about 30 percent of our growth has come from exports -- but that we at this particular moment in history, because of our relative economic strength, have an extra obligation to try to build a system for the 21st century where every person in every country who is willing to work hard has a chance to get a just reward for it.
And that means that we have to -- in my opinion, that means that we have to continue to contribute our fair share to the International Monetary Fund. It means we have to do everything we can to support our friends in Russia who believe that we should continue to reform. It means that Secretary Rubin's upcoming meeting with the Finance Minister of Japan, former Prime Minister Miyazawa, is profoundly important. Unless Japan begins to grow again, it's going to be difficult for Russia and other countries to do what they need to do. It means, in short, that America must maintain a leadership role of active involvement in trying to build an economic system that rewards people who do the right thing. And that's in our best interest.
So I think this is a terribly important thing. The volatility in the world markets, including in our stock market, I think is to be expected under these circumstances. The right thing to do is to try to restore growth in the economies of the world where there isn't enough growth now, and to continually examine whether the institutions we have for dealing with problems are adequate to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow. And we are aggressively involved in both those activities.
MR. YELTSIN: Naturally, we face problems basically of our own. We have not been able to do many things over the past time when we started our reforms. And still we need to conclude our reforms, to bring them to completion, and consequently, to get results.
We are not saying that we count solely on the support from outside -- no. One more time I will reiterate this no. So let your mass media not spread the word to the effect that allegedly we would count solely on the support from the West. And to this end, we have gathered together here by no means. What we need from the United States is political support to the effect that the United States is in favor of reforms in Russia. This is what we really need, and then all the investors who would like to come to the Russian reformed market will do so, will come with their investments. And this is what we really need now. This is what is lacking -- investments. This is first and foremost.
Certainly, we ought to fight our expenditures pattern and mismanagement. This is the second issue which, to us, is one of the most important issues. And we have been adopting accordingly the measures which need to be taken -- like we have adopted the program of stabilization measures; in other words, those measures which will result in stabilization of our reforms. Stabilization -- I believe that such measures and such a program will work, promptly, over the coming two years it will produce results.
 
U.S.-Russia Links
Q. Mr. Clinton . . . what is the basis of your belief that our country will get back to its feet and that Russian-U.S. relations have promising prospects?
MR. CLINTON: Well, my belief that Russian-U.S. relations have promising prospects has been supported by the agreements we have made in the security and foreign policy areas. My belief that Russia will get back on its feet is based on my observation that in Russian history every time outsiders counted the Russian people out, they turned out to be wrong. And this is a very big challenge, but, I mean, a country that rebuffed Napoleon and Hitler can surely adjust to the realities of the global marketplace.
Now, what's to be done? The reason I wanted to come here and -- to be fair, let me back up and say, I don't think there are many people in America who are afraid of Russia anymore. I think there are some people in America who questioned whether I should come at this moment of great economic and political tension for the country. But I don't think it's because they want something bad to happen to Russia. I think, by and large, the American people wish Russia well and want things to go well for Russia, and like the fact that we are partners in Bosnia and that we've reduced our nuclear arsenals so much and that we've reduced our deficit establishment and that we've found other ways to cooperate in space, for example. I think most Americans like this very, very much.
So let me go back to the economic question. I believe whether you succeed and how long it takes you to succeed in restoring real growth to the Russian economy depends upon President Yeltsin's ability to persuade the Duma to support his formation of a government which will pursue a path of reform with a genuine sensitivity to the personal dislocation of the people who have been hurt. And here's where I think the World Bank and other institutions can come in and perhaps help deal with some of the fallout, if you will, of the reform process.
But I think if other political forces in Russia try to force the President to abandon reform in midstream or even reverse it, what I think will happen is even less money will come into Russia, and even more economic hardship will result. I believe that because that is, it seems to me, the unwavering experience of every other country.
That does not mean you should not have a social safety net. It does not mean you have to make the same domestic decisions that the United States or Great Britain or France or Sweden or any other country has made. You have to form your own relationship with this new economic reality. But I still believe that, unless there is a manifest commitment to reform, the economy will not get better.
So I support President Yeltsin's commitment in that regard. And I think those -- my conviction that it will get better is based on my reading of your history. How long it will take to get better depends a lot more on you and what happens here than anything else we outsiders can do, although if there is a clear movement toward reform, I'll do everything I can to accelerate outside support of all kinds.
 
Lewinsky Situation
Q. Has the reaction since your admission of a relationship with Ms. Lewinsky given you any cause for concern that you may not be as effective as you should be in leading the country?
MR. CLINTON: No, I've actually been quite heartened by the reaction of the American people and leaders throughout the world about it. I have acknowledged that I made a mistake, said that I regretted it, asked to be forgiven, spent a lot of very valuable time with my family in the last couple of weeks and said I was going back to work. I believe that's what the American people want me to do, and based on my conversations with leaders around the world, I think that's what they want me to do, and that is what I intend to do.
As you can see from what we're discussing here, there are very large issues that will affect the future of the American people in the short run and over the long run. There are large issues that have to be dealt with now in the world and at home. And so I have been quite encouraged by what I think the message from the American people has been and what I know the message from leaders around the world has been. And I'm going to do my best to continue to go through this personal process in an appropriate way, but to do my job, to do the job I was hired to do, and I think that very much needs to be done right now.
 
Russia and NATO
Q. The question has to do with the relationship between Russia and NATO . . . How do you think this relation should evolve in the future?
MR. YELTSIN: Yes, we have discussed with President Clinton the question concerning the relationship between Russia and NATO. We're not running away from the position which has been that we are against NATO expanding eastward. We believe this is a blunder, a big mistake, and one day this will be a historic error.
Therefore, at this point in time, what we necessarily would like to do is to improve relations so that there be no confrontation. Therefore, we have signed an agreement between Russia and NATO. And in accordance with that agreement we want to do our job. However, no way shall we allow anybody to transgress that agreement, bypass that agreement, or, generally speaking, put aside it. No, this will not happen. . . .
MR. CLINTON: I would like to say one word about that. We obviously, President Yeltsin and I, have a disagreement about whether it was appropriate for NATO to take on new members or not. But I think there is a larger reality here where we are in agreement, and I would like to emphasize it.
Russia has made historic commitments in the last few years to essentially redefine its greatness, not in terms of the territorial dominance of its neighbors, but instead, of constructive leadership in the region and in the world. The expansion of NATO, therefore, should be seen primarily as nations interested in working together to deal with common security problems, not to be ready to repel expected invasions. . . .
 
Chernomyrdin's Fate
Q. President Yeltsin, do you see any circumstance in which you could accept someone other than Mr. Chernomyrdin to be your Prime Minister? And, Mr. President, another Lewinsky question. You know, there have been some who have expressed disappointment that you didn't offer a formal apology the other night when you spoke to the American people. Are you -- do you feel you need to offer an apology?
MR. YELTSIN: Well, I must say, we will witness quite a few events for us to be able to achieve all those results. That's all.
MR. CLINTON: That's my answer, too. That was pretty good. . . .

The Firewall: Doubts About a Tactic to Contain Chaos

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 2

 BODY:
Inside the Treasury Department, some of the strategists desperately seeking to contain spreading outbreaks of financial chaos once called their approach the "firewall strategy."
The idea was straightforward and born of Washington's success in containing the Mexican peso crisis in 1995. As foreign currencies plummeted and investors fled -- first from Thailand, then Indonesia, then Korea and now Russia -- the Treasury and the International Monetary Fund would stitch together a bailout that insisted on far-reaching reforms, which would rebuild national economies in America's image. 
 The hope was that the emergency support from the I.M.F. would buy some time, and the promise of change -- cleaning up failing banks, imposing austerity and ending corruption and crony capitalism -- would lure back investors and protect the United States and other countries from economic contagion.
But now firewall strategy is coming undone. It has collided, some Administration officials concede, with the inability -- or unwillingness -- of weak or inexperienced foreign governments to give stock and currency markets what they want.
"The political price of complying with the markets' demands are finally hitting home," said Robert D. Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company, which was an investor in Asia and has been deeply involved in the bailouts of South Korea and Russia. "And they simply seem too high."
In Russia, firewall strategy has never amounted to more than a few haphazardly placed bricks. The Parliament has refused to enact many of the I.M.F.'s conditions; the central bank has virtually run out of dollars to defend the ruble, and the Western aid that was sent in late July -- $4.8 billion -- has seemed to vanish. .
Speaker Newt Gingrich drove the point home today in demanding that the Clinton Administration explain why Congress should give $18 billion more to the I.M.F. "Where has all this money gone?" he asked Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin in a letter. "How much of this money has left Russia? How much of this money is in the hands of corrupt officials or their corrupt business associates?"
In Indonesia, the firewall was built of straw and was immediately ignited. Now, with a Government barely hanging on, rioters targeting the Chinese minority, which brought much foreign investment into the country, and the Army reeling, the Fund's program is at a virtual standstill.
And this week, Malaysia became the first country to reject the I.M.F.'s advice -- and Mr. Rubin's -- in explicit terms, deciding to turn its back on the free market and virtually halt currency trading.
Investors have been told that the country's currency cannot be traded outside the country -- all of it must be returned to Malaysia by Oct. 1 or it will be declared worthless. Today Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad dismissed his presumed successor, Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who has been an advocate of free-market strategies and a champion of financial modernization in Asia. Mr. Anwar's house has been cordoned off by police, and there is widespread speculation that he may soon be arrested for sedition.
One senior Administration official today called the turn of events in Malaysia -- a country where firms like Intel, Motorola and Matsushita have built huge factories -- "a tragedy." Others said it was the inevitable clash between the power of government and the power of markets, and they predicted that Mr. Mahathir's effort to wall himself off from financial markets would be a spectacular failure.
Mr. Mahathir saw it differently. "Malaysia is facing terrible problems because of the Western capitalist system, which has gone wild," he said on Saturday. "Financial instruments have become as good as gunboats for colonizing."
Mr. Mahathir has always ranked among the most vocal critics of what he views as Western efforts to dominate Asia, and in brighter times he was a leading advocate of promoting "Asian values." But the Asian values debate was largely about cultural and legal issues -- the American emphasis on individual rights, for example, versus an Asian insistence on the importance of stability and the good of the community.
The current argument, while couched in terms of I.M.F. plans and currency conversions, is an offshoot of that debate. In Russia, Malaysia and even Japan, the United States is insisting on reforms that would essentially give power to investors to move their money across borders at will, instead of to governments seeking to control their destinies.
Mr. Rubin, a man trained on the trading room floor, has cast this choice in stark terms: countries that try to interfere with the freedom of markets will be cut off by international investors and starved for lack of international capital. His speeches and President Clinton's stiffly worded speech in Moscow on Tuesday make it clear that the United States and the I.M.F. will only aid countries that adopt reforms along the lines the I.M.F. has prescribed.
"This is the first time Rubin has had to face a series of political revolts to his plans," a White House official observed this week.
Mr. Rubin's team insists that the country-by-country approach -- getting the fundamental economics right, forcing the disclosure of more financial information -- still works. Thailand and Korea, his aides say, recently managed to lower interest rates, and there is hope that this will help spur their economies in 1999. In Latin America, they argue, countries like Brazil have taken preventive measures, which have helped ward off the kinds of disasters that struck Asia and Russia.
But Mr. Rubin's deputy, Lawrence H. Summers, has said many times in recent months, "We can't want reform in any country more than its government and its people do."
And that is essentially what is beginning to happen now. The United States is virtually screaming at Japan to end seven years of economic paralysis, and it will repeat the message on Friday night when Mr. Rubin and Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, meet in San Francisco with Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's finance minister and a 40-year veteran of United States-Japan relations.
But dragging Japan, which has the world's second-largest economy, toward politically painful reforms has been almost as difficult as dragging Russia and Indonesia in that direction. And, increasingly, there is a sense inside the Treasury that, in the words of a top official, "We don't have much time." Japan could touch off another, far more serious round of financial crises if it fails to deal with its problems.

Hong Kong Restricts Short Sales of Some Stocks

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Sept. 2

 BODY:
The Hong Kong government bolstered the stock market again today by suspending short-selling of shares in a number of companies.
The crackdown forced the short-sellers -- who sell borrowed stock in the hope that the price of the stock will subsequently fall -- to cover their bets today by repurchasing shares. 
 The government has been buying stocks, and lifting the overall market, since mid-August to thwart short-sellers, and today's action had a similar effect. The Hang Seng index of 33 leading issues jumped 6.2 percent.
Stock exchange officials suspended short-selling of shares in the banking giant HSBC Holdings, Hong Kong Telecommunications, and China Telecom (Hong Kong) Ltd. until they could clear a backlog of trades. Those companies had been the three most popular issues to sell short as they ranked among the most heavily traded shares on the Hong Kong market.
The exchange also reinstated a rule that requires people selling a borrowed stock to do so at a price that is at least equal to the last asking price quoted on the exchange for that stock. That regulation is known as the "tick rule."
The crackdown on short-selling kept many traders out of the market. Shares with a total value of $5.8 billion (Hong Kong), or $748 million (United States), changed hands, a small fraction of last Friday's record volume of $79 billion (Hong Kong). Short sales amounted to $31.4 billion (Hong Kong), compared with $9.1 trillion (Hong Kong) on Friday.
In short sales, the lenders of shares -- typically pension funds, insurance companies and mutual funds that arrange the sales through a stockbroker -- earn money from the interest rates they charge the borrowers.
As the supply of stock has dried up, rates to borrow such shares have surged. Annual interest rates to borrow stocks that are components of the Hang Seng index now stand around 15 percent, more than a tenfold increase from before the government intervention.
Last Friday, investors rushed to borrow stocks so that they could sell them to the government as it embarked on its buying spree.
Many of those who had lent the stocks called in those shares so that they could take advantage of what they perceived to be the last day of the government purchases. Today, they hurried to buy back those shares to cover the short sales.

HEADLINE: THE MARKET TURMOIL: ECONOMIC SCENE;
Relax. Stocks Rarely Steer the Economy.

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN 

 BODY:
Are plunging stock prices a harbinger of economic crisis? Paul Samuelson, the Nobel laureate in economics, once quipped that stock market declines had anticipated nine of the previous five recessions.
That impish caution from decades ago has been updated by Peter Temin, a colleague of Mr. Samuelson at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. After examining every recession this century, he concludes that only a minor downturn, in 1903, was caused by falling stock prices. Some recessions were caused by anti-inflationary policies of the Federal Reserve Board. Others were caused by external events, like the oil price shocks in the 1970's. Even the Great Depression of the 1930's did not stem from plummeting stock prices. Chalk that horror up to persistent policy blunders here and abroad. 
 History does not necessarily repeat itself. But the nearly unblemished record is a sobering counterpoint to breezy speculation this week about recession, rising unemployment and other economic woes that could follow the recent plunge on Wall Street. On Monday, the broad market gauge lost more than 7 percent of its value, leaving it down nearly 20 percent from its peak in July.
Though no forerunner of recession, stock market plunges can nevertheless slow an economy. Consumers react to their shrunken wealth by cutting purchases. Companies, fearful of uncertainty and forced to issue a larger number of (lower-priced) shares to raise any given amount of money, react by cutting investment outlays. It is possible, then, that a stock market crash could tip an economy into recession.
But that leap would occur only after a sharp decline and then only under certain conditions. A back-of-the-envelope calculation shows why a stock drop the size of the one in the last couple of weeks is unlikely to do serious harm.
American stocks are worth about $10 trillion; in recent weeks, their value has fallen about $1 trillion. Economists estimate that consumers cut back spending by about 4 cents for every dollar of wealth they lose. So a trillion-dollar stock market plunge would cause about a $40 billion drop in annual consumer spending, about one-half percent of total spending. Prof. Benjamin Friedman of Harvard University points out that it ordinarily takes a spending cut four times that size to bring on a recession.
A $40 billion cut in consumer spending could produce a downturn in an already-stagnant economy. But this economy is strong, with consumer spending and business investment growing briskly in the first half of the year. Besides, consumers may not cut back spending even as much as these estimates suggest because many might not react to a drop in paper wealth from recent sky-high levels they never regarded as secure. Consumers did not rush out the minute the Dow hit 9,300 to order a new yacht, nor are they likely to cancel the family vacation because of a possibly temporary fall below 8,000.
If the argument sounds Pollyannaish, consider what was wrought by October 1987, when the market plunged by more than 20 percent in one day. Main Street -- national output and jobs -- barely noticed, though some regions, like New York City, were hit hard. The economy is more resilient today than it was 11 years ago. Inflation, interest rates and unemployment are low. Bank reserves are high. The Federal Reserve could readily fight off recession by pumping up the money supply without fear of igniting inflation or making other smoldering problems worse.
That is what the Fed, under its chairman, Alan Greenspan, did in 1987.
Yet there is one problem today that Mr. Greenspan did not face in 1987. Asia is mired in recession, and financial crises plague Russia and threaten Latin America.
Indeed, some economists and market watchers called this week for the Fed to set domestic monetary policy with an eye toward the plight of the country's trading partners, perhaps nudging rates down even if the American economy needs no such help.
Lower domestic interest rates would ease the debt burden of foreigners who have borrowed in dollars. Lower rates in the United States would also drag down interest rates in countries that tie their currencies to the dollar. That too will help these countries recover. And, the argument goes, if a Fed easing helps Asia and other beleaguered regions recover, then the United States will eventually reap the benefit of trading with prosperous partners.
But while it's easy to call on the Fed to take global factors into account, Federal law and good sense dictate that Fed policy follow home-grown events. Professor Friedman cautions against having the Fed tailor its policies to foreign borrowing practices or exchange rate policies. Prof. Alan Blinder of Princeton, a former vice chairman of the Fed, says the impact of Fed policy on foreign economies is neither huge nor certain.
Counting on Fed easing to help the domestic economy by bolstering foreign economies is to rely on a speculative chain of events that provides no sure guide to policy. Economists agree that the Fed needs to factor foreign demand for exports into its projections about the domestic economy. Mr. Blinder can imagine times when the Fed would decide to ease because of weakness abroad even though it was otherwise wavering between cutting rates and standing pat. But almost always, the Fed's focus must be domestic needs alone.
The important point, on which monetary experts agree, is that the Fed's monetary weapons are powerful enough to keep the American economy in line, short of financial catastrophe abroad. The Fed can pump up domestic spending by making it easier to borrow. Any shortfall in foreign demand for American products can be offset by additional American purchases.
Doomsayers point out that plummeting stock prices could spook the international currency and capital markets, leading to a self-fulfilling pessimism among consumers and investors. From there the story turns to worldwide downturn and even deflation reminiscent of the 1930's. But few economists find that story compelling. They point out that a lot of stock investments are tied up in retirement and pension accounts and will not be dumped the minute the markets turn sour. Besides, investors who lived through the carnage in 1987 are secure they can ride out the next nose dive.
It is tempting to exaggerate the impact of dramatic events like this week's stock market volatility. But consider that even at this week's low, stock prices were about where they were in January -- and well above the levels at the end of 1996 that caused Mr. Greenspan to warn that the market was irrationally high. Suppose, rather than soaring beyond 9,000 in July and swooning below 7,600 in August, the Dow had merely moseyed its way on an even track for eight months at what were widely perceived to be high levels. Would anyone now be wringing hands over a recessionary blow to the American economy that could reverberate across international borders?
Stock prices rise and fall and, as Mr. Samuelson taught us 30 years ago, that's that.

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN MOSCOW: THE OVERVIEW;
PRESIDENT SAYS AID WILL RISE IF RUSSIA PRESSES REFORMS

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Sept. 2

 BODY:
President Clinton signaled today that the West would step up its aid to Russia if the Kremlin pressed ahead with tough economic reforms.
His message, intended to encourage the Government of President Boris N. Yeltsin to stick with its pro-capitalist course despite the nation's deepening economic crisis, was the most striking development as a two-day summit meeting ended. It was dominated by a collapsing ruble and a Government paralyzed by its battles with a Communist opposition. 
 "If the reform process can be completed, then I for one would be strongly supportive of greater assistance to Russia from the United States and the other big economic powers," Mr. Clinton said during a joint news conference with Mr. Yeltsin. Excerpts, page A10.
Russia recently negotiated a $17 billion bailout with the International Monetary Fund, $4.8 billion of which has been delivered.
But the financial turmoil that has rocked the Yeltsin Government has led the United States to think about further steps to speed and expand Western assistance.
American officials do not have a detailed plan of just how much additional aid might be provided and where the funds would come from.
But Mr. Clinton has told his aides that the United States should be prepared to lead a new international aid effort, which could draw on the Group of Seven industrialized nations and international organizations like the World Bank.
"If there is a clear movement toward reform, I'll do everything I can to accelerate outside support of all kinds," Mr. Clinton said, echoing assurances that were also provided in private meetings with Mr. Yeltsin, according to Mr. Clinton's aides.
Providing further assistance to Russia is far from a popular idea with Congress. The United States also appears to be out in front of many of its allies on the issue, although Tony Blair, the British Prime Minister and current chairman of the Group of Seven, telephoned Mr. Yeltsin on Monday to indicate general support for Russia if economic reforms continued.
Clinton aides said billions in aid would be a small price for keeping Russia's young democracy on a reform course and preventing the rise of an anti-Western regime. They stressed, however, that Russia bears the primary responsibility and that fresh assistance would be provided only if the Kremlin demonstrates that it has the political will not just to talk about reforms, but also to carry them out.
"It is absolutely critical for the well-being of the United States for decades to come that Russia not lurch backwards," a senior American official said. "But we have also made it clear that Russia needs to take steps to insure that the money that is here stays here and does not leave."
Whether Russia can summon the determination to put its economy in order, however, is far from clear.
Mr. Yeltsin vowed today to proceed with economic reforms and said: "What we need from the United States is political support, support for Russian reforms. Then all investors who want to come to the reformed Russia will come."
He also reappointed Boris G. Fyodorov, an aide who backs a strong free-market policy, as Deputy Prime Minister. No sooner was Mr. Fyodorov officially restored than he began talking about tough measures to stabilize Russia's battered currency.
There are few, however, who believe that gestures alone will do the trick.
Russia still lacks a Prime Minister, leaving in doubt the Kremlin's overall commitment to economic reform and its ability to garner support for its policies. Mr. Yeltsin's current choice, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, was decisively rejected by the Communist-led Parliament on Monday.
Another vote is scheduled for Friday, but his opponents say he sure to lose again. And a third defeat would result in the disbanding of the legislature and new elections.
That would represent a major escalation in the Kremlin's tug of war with the Communists. It is far from clear, however, whether the politically and physically weakened Mr. Yeltsin has the stomach for the fight. The Russian President dodged a question today on his commitment to Mr. Chernomyrdin.
American officials say Mr. Yeltsin appears to be pondering dumping Mr. Chernomyrdin for a new candidate like Konstantin A. Titov, the reform-minded Governor of the Samara region; Yegor S. Stroyev, the head of the upper house of Parliament and a Yeltsin ally, or Mayor Yuri M. Luzkhov of Moscow.
The delays in forming a new government have also put off the economic decisions that are needed to extract the nation from its crisis and regain credibility with the West.
The I.M.F., for instance, was scheduled to decide whether to distribute the next $4.3 billion installment of its loan by mid-September.
Stanley Fischer, the fund's No. 2 official, said the I.M.F. would be unlikely to take up the matter before October.
"Given what we know now about the changes in the exchange rate, of course difficulties in the banking system, possible difficulties in the budget, it's clear that the Russians will have to do quite a lot before that money could be released," Mr. Fischer told the CNN program "Moneyline."
Mr. Fischer's timetable clashed with the Clinton Administration's promise to try to accelerate aid, pointing to the confusion in Western ranks about how to help Russia.
But without a new government in place, even Mr. Yeltsin's biggest boosters found it difficult to make the case for speedy help.
Despite the addled Russian political scene, today's summit sessions proved to be more substantive than many observers had predicted.
The Clinton Administration scheduled the summit meeting hoping to promote Russian ratification of strategic arms treaty known as Start-2. It soon found the issue issue overtaken by the rush of economic events.
Still, the two leaders signed an arms accord to share missile-warning data and agreed to begin disposing of bomb-grade plutonium.
Mr. Clinton used his sessions with Mr. Yeltsin to encourage him to stay the economic course.
And in a meeting with opposition politicians today, Mr. Clinton sought to persuade Gennadi A. Zyuganov, the Communist leader, of the need to play by the rules of the free market.
There was no sign that Mr. Clinton made any headway on that score -- or in persuading the Communists to cooperate with Mr. Yeltsin. Some opposition leaders said, however, that Mr. Clinton did the right thing by coming.
Grigory A. Yavlinsky, the leader of the liberal Yabloko party, said many Russians appreciated that Mr. Clinton had gone through with the summit, despite the nation's latest crisis.
"It was the right idea to come," he said. "Clinton was a brave man to come to Russia in the conditions we are in now."

HEADLINE: Main Street Investors Take the Bear by the Horns

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: MARSHALLTOWN, Iowa, Sept. 2

 BODY:
During these pogo stick days on Wall Street, Stanley Walker, a retired mechanic with a good chunk of his life savings in the stock market, has thought once or twice about his boyhood in the Depression years.
And he has no desire to have pockets so empty, as his father did, that Sunday dinner means pig tails and sauerkraut. 
 "Is it time to pull the rip cord?" Mr. Walker, 77, nervously asked his broker on Monday, when the market dived more than 500 points. "I like to be able to sleep at night."
His broker told him to relax. And Mr. Walker, who did not sell a single stock, is trying to do just that.
Despite some jitters, there is little apparent panic on Main Street this week.
"People are becoming old veterans at this," said Doug Reese, a broker here for Edward Jones. "They've been through all of this before."
As in most of America, the stock market has become everybody's game in this pleasant Iowa courthouse town. Inside the Muddy Waters coffee shop, small investors who endured the plunge of Monday and rode a strong rebound on Tuesday echo all the financial-analyst cliches: the economy's "strong fundamentals," "great buying opportunities" and, of course, the importance of "staying in for the long haul."
Some people have even become a bit blase about the market's gyrations.
One is Mark Engle, a 44-year-oldteacher of high school Russian, who kicked his boots up on a chair and rattled this morning's issue of The Des Moines Register.
On the front page, there was a cartoon about Wall Street that showed a bunch of little chickens screaming about a falling sky, along with a frightened-looking bull. But Mr. Engle skipped right past the articles about the market, turning instead to the sports section to read about Mark McGwire, the home run king, who, to paraphrase Babe Ruth's line, is having a much better year than Wall Street.
"He's amazing," Mr. Engle said.
In recent years, though, it is the market that has hit the home runs for people in this town of 26,000 about 40 miles northeast of Des Moines.
Market gains allowed Barb Collins to retire from a factory job at the age of 57, vacation in France, England and Italy, and cruise to Crete. She even has a vacation home in Minnesota. To people like Mrs. Collins, now 63, who was pushing her 1-year-old grandson, Ariaus, in a stroller on this sunny day, there is little point in complaining about a bumpy stretch of road along an otherwise magnificent run.
DyAnne Henry, 49, who owns an embroidery shop, In Stitches, said the stock market was a lot like life.
"You have some highs and you have some lows," she said between bites of pancakes at Monica's coffee shop. "But if you have patience and keep the faith, everything mellows out in the end."
Despite the general buoyancy, however, Mr. Reese, the broker, noted that some nettlesome developments had given investors a number of uneasy moments. Besides the specter of a weakened President Clinton, tarnished after acknowledging that he misled the public about his relationship with a White House intern, there are the financial and political crises in Russia and the economic turmoil in Asia.
In a place like Iowa, which exports plenty of grain and agriculture-related machinery, among other goods, a crisis halfway around the globe can come home to roost in a hurry.
"When it comes to economics, Iowa is by no means isolated," said Mr. Engle, the Russian teacher. "How we do depends a great deal on how people in other countries are doing."
Tom Mueller, a 47-year-old insurance salesman, expressed few worries about the strength of the American economy, although he did have doubts about the President's effectiveness.
"You can't help but think he's not the same leader that he was four or five weeks ago," said Mr. Mueller, who got up early today to watch Mr. Clinton and the Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, on television in Moscow. "He doesn't come across as being so confident anymore. Is that going to hurt our standing around the world?"
In general, though, people did not seem to think that Mr. Clinton's problems would hurt the stock market. Making a connection between the Washington soap opera and the earnings of Fortune 500 companies is "a bit of a stretch," Shirley Duffy said.
Mrs. Duffy, 69, who operates tours for Iowans to places like Nova Scotia, Alaska and New York, said she was not going to take a penny out of the market. She and her husband, Wallace, became alarmed at a sudden downturn two years ago and shifted much of their holdings to fixed-income accounts. That proved a mistake.
"We learned our lesson," Mrs. Duffy said, "so we're going to sit tight."
Mr. Reese and other brokers have been talking to customers about a downturn's silver lining. For much of the last few years, he had to tamp down expectations of investors, many of whom were looking for whopping gains in a matter of weeks. Now, with prices on many stocks down 15 to 20 percent in only a few months, he has been encouraging investors to think about adding to their holdings.
Not that everyone is prepared to jump on board.
John Kraft, a 38-year-old painter, said that he would like to get into the market but would stay out, in deference to his wife.
"She doesn't like the idea," he explained, "that you can end the day with less money than you had yesterday."

HEADLINE: In Gubernatorial Debate, Democrats Sound Like Allies

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: TROY, N.Y., Sept. 2

 BODY:
With remarkable unanimity, the Democratic candidates for governor attacked Gov. George E. Pataki on the state budget, job growth, education and campaign finance in a debate here tonight, treating one another more like chums than like adversaries.
In a hint of the shifting fortunes of the campaign, none of the other candidates overtly attacked Lieut. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross or asked her any questions, as they did in previous debates when she was clearly considered the front-runner. In forums held last month, they demanded that she explain positions she had taken just a few years ago as a Republican, often leaving her struggling for a response. 
 What went unmentioned in tonight's hourlong event, however, was the recent talk of the campaign: the apparent disarray in Ms. McCaughey Ross's camp. She spent much of the day denying reports that her campaign manager, Michael Nussbaum, had been ousted, and refusing to answer questions about whether she intended to launch a long-awaited television advertising campaign.
"I'm going to be making a statement about my campaign finances tomorrow," she told a crush of reporters after the debate at Hudson Valley Community College.
Tonight's was the sort of exchange candidates claim to want: a polite, serious discussion of issues. The other contenders were Peter F. Vallone, the New York City Council Speaker; Charles J. Hynes, Brooklyn District Attorney, and James Larocca, a businessman and former state transportation commissioner.
But the debate failed to inject any fire into a race that so far has not received much voter attention. The event, sponsored by the League of Women Voters and public television, will be broadcast statewide Thursday night on public television.
The most enthusiastic attacks on the Governor came about his handling of state spending and borrowing, which have increased sharply, with all four Democrats claiming that they would be more fiscally responsible than Mr. Pataki, an avowed conservative. They also charged that the Governor had done little for the anemic upstate economy.
"We are looking at the possibility of significant budget cuts as early as next spring," Mr. Larocca said. "Today in New York, there is no economic development plan. There isn't even a plan to make a plan."
Mr. Vallone, whose standing in some polls has risen at Ms. McCaughey Ross's expense, referred to the fact that the state had begun this fiscal year with a $2.4 billion surplus but now projects large deficits in two years. "When you take that surplus and turn it into an admitted $5.5 billion deficit in a few years," he said, "that is the height of irresponsibility."
He repeated his call for a state law giving preference to New York businesses in government contracting, similar to a measure Mr. Pataki vetoed this year. That idea has been called into question by some economists, and none of the other Democrats have advocated it.
The only real note of disagreement came in the area of campaign finance reform. Mr. Vallone, Mr. Hynes and Mr. Larocca advocated measures like strict contribution limits, public financing of campaigns and a ban on "soft money," the unlimited contributions to parties, ostensibly for organizational needs.
But Mr. Larocca took Mr. Vallone to task for taking contributions from people who do business New York City, saying that the practice should be banned.
But Ms. McCaughey Ross, whose own campaign treasury is provided almost entirely by her husband, the investment banker Wilbur L. Ross Jr., would only say that she favored banning contributions by anyone with a business interest before the state. She refused to say whether she supported tighter contribution limits, a ban on soft money, public financing of campaigns, or any other measure.
All four candidates lauded the higher high school graduation standards adopted recently by the Board of Regents. But they agreed that the schools were not ready to meet those standards, and advocated an expansion of school programs for the youngest children, and after-school programs for older students.
The candidates agreed that patients should have the right to sue their health insurers, something now denied by state law. And all said that many drug offenders should be sent to rehabilitation programs, not prison. The only attack on the lieutenant governor came from Mr. Larocca, in discussing health care. He said that patients would be better off "if the conservative right wing hadn't trashed the national health care program" proposed by President Clinton.
That was a reference to Ms. McCaughey Ross, who first gained fame critiquing the Clinton plan. But Mr. Larocca did not mention the lieutenant governor by name.
Even as Ms. McCaughey Ross was trying to focus on the debate, she and her aides were besieged with questions about the status of her campaign. Several people close to the campaign said Mr. Nussbaum, a top adviser to the campaign, had not spoken to Ms. McCaughey Ross or spent time at her campaign headquarters since last week.
Kevin Davitt, a spokesman for Ms. McCaughey Ross, said that Mr. Nussbaum had left only for a few days to take his son to school in Boston, and that he was still "giving us tremendous advice."
But others close to the campaign said that Mr. Nussbaum's absence was provoked by the disagreement between Ms. McCaughey Ross and her husband over financing for the campaign. They point out that Mr. Nussbaum is closer to Mr. Ross than he is to Ms. McCaughey Ross.
Mr. Nussbaum is an executive at News Communications, a company owned by Mr. Ross, and is not paid for his work on the campaign, Mr. Davitt said.
Mr. Ross has provided more than $3 million to his wife's campaign, but hardly any of it has been spent. People close to the campaign said that Ms. McCaughey Ross had been trying to persuade her husband in recent days to spend the money on advertising, but that he was reluctant. With the Sept. 15 primary less than two weeks away, Ms. McCaughey Ross has begun talking privately about spending her personal savings on advertising, they said.

HEADLINE: TESTING OF A PRESIDENT: IN MOSCOW;
CLINTON DEFENDS HIS TV ADMISSION ON LEWINSKY CASE

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Sept. 2

 BODY:
Directly questioned for the first time in public about the Monica Lewinsky matter since his televised admission two weeks ago, President Clinton said at a Kremlin news conference today that he believed he had expressed "profound regret" to those who had been hurt by his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
While his remarks today amplified his previous statements, the President again stopped short of issuing an outright apology for the illicit relationship or for lying about it to his family, his staff and the nation. And Mr. Clinton repeated that the investigation by the Whitewater independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, that brought him to this pass was "disproportionate" to his alleged offenses. 
 "I have acknowledged that I made a mistake, said that I regretted it, asked to be forgiven, spent a lot of very valuable time with my family in the last couple of weeks and said I was going back to work," Mr. Clinton said, speaking at a joint news conference here with President Boris N. Yeltsin.
"I believe that's what the American people want me to do, and based on my conversations with leaders around the world, I think that's what they want me to do, and that is what I intend to do."
Mr. Clinton also said he was "heartened" by the reaction of the American people and world leaders to his public admission on Aug. 17, the same day that he testified to the grand jury about accusations that he had lied about the relationship and tried to cover it up.
But within the walls of the Kremlin, as Russia is seething with political intrigue and economic privation, the President looked anything but heartened by having to deal with the Lewinsky matter when he would prefer to be conducting high-level diplomacy. Mr. Clinton's demeanor during the news conference, which lasted 43 minutes -- indeed, throughout the two-day summit meeting here -- was subdued, almost mournful.
In the last two weeks, Mr. Clinton has come under heavy criticism, much of it from members of his own party and political allies, who said he was insufficiently contrite and overly defensive in his public statements two weeks ago.
Aides said he had been prepared for questions about the Lewinsky matter at the news conference and decided on his own to address them rather than rebuffing them as inappropriate in a foreign country.
Yet Mr. Clinton's response today to the first question left many in the White House press corps dissatisfied. At the next opportunity, he was asked whether he regretted the bitter tone of his statement and felt that he owed an apology to his family, his supporters and the American people.
Mr. Clinton tried to avoid the question by jokingly echoing a curt response by Mr. Yeltsin to a separate question about his prospects for forming a Government out of the current political chaos in Moscow. But President Clinton then gave a fuller answer.
"I think the question of the tone of the speech, and people's reaction to it, is really a function of ----. I can't comment on that," Mr. Clinton said as Mr. Yeltsin looked on alternately bemused and bewildered by the spectacle in the beautifully restored Catherine's Hall in the Kremlin.
Mr. Clinton continued, "I read it the other day again, and I thought it was clear that I was expressing my profound regret to all who were hurt and to all who were involved, and my desire not to see any more people hurt by this process and caught up in it."
Then, elaborating on his combative words toward Mr. Starr, the President added: "And I was commenting that it seemed to be something that most reasonable people would think had consumed a disproportionate amount of America's time, money and resources and attention, and now continued to involve more and more people. And that's what I tried to say."
White House aides offered no elaboration on the President's remarks.
"On this matter," said Michael D. McCurry, the White House press secretary, "the President obviously wants to speak from the heart, and he did. He said what he wanted to say, and I don't think it's the role of staff to try to amplify or comment further on his remarks."
Nor would Mr. McCurry or other aides provide the names of the "leaders around the world" who Mr. Clinton said had offered him support and encouragement after his admission of an inappropriate relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and his misleading public statements on it. Officials would not say whether Mr. Clinton's comments today would be his last on the matter.
He has spent some of the rare unscheduled time on this trip making calls to the United States to gauge the impact of his admission, a senior White House aide said. Other officials on the trip have also been in contact with Congressional Democrats to try to judge their mood as they return to Washington.
One senior Administration official who has worked closely with Mr. Clinton at the summit meeting said he had seen no evidence the President was dejected over the Lewinsky revelations and the critical reaction to his televised speech last month.
The official said Mr. Clinton's somber mood over the last two days reflected the turmoil in Moscow.
"This is a serious situation which does not lend itself to laughter," the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
The official said Mr. Clinton's mental state had not affected his ability to do his job. "Not on this trip," the official added.
Mr. Yeltsin did not comment on the questions about Ms. Lewinsky, either in the news conference or in private meetings with Mr. Clinton, American officials said.
But Grigory A. Yavlinsky, leader of a liberal political party here, said that many Russians sympathized with Mr. Clinton for the legal problems he faced arising from the Lewinsky matter.
"We look at it in a more personal way," Mr. Yavlinsky said. "We don't take this juridical view."

HEADLINE: Northwest Lays Off 27,000, Increasing Pressure on Strike

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
Northwest Airlines laid off more than half of its 51,000 workers yesterday, spreading the economic disruption created by a five-day-old strike of its pilots.
The move signals that the airline is preparing for a protracted battle while at the same time increasing pressure on President Clinton to order the pilots back to work, an intervention that the company has been quietly seeking. 
 Northwest said that with its 1,700 daily flights grounded since Saturday by the walkout, it had no need for a full work force. The 27,500 employees being laid off, including mechanics, flight attendants and customer service representatives, are also in contract negotiations with the company. Unions representing these workers remained firm in their support of the pilots.
Also yesterday, as Northwest canceled all its flights through the Labor Day weekend, the Department of Transportation said that two commuter airlines affiliated with Northwest had violated Federal law by suspending service to 17 small cities in 11 states. The department ordered the airlines, Mesaba Airlines and Express Airlines I, which connect the cities with Northwest's hub airports in Detroit, Minneapolis and Memphis, to resume flying today. The commuter airlines' pilots are not on strike.
The large layoff means that Northwest, which is the country's fourth-largest carrier and dominates much of the Midwest, will not be flying again anytime soon, even if it reaches a settlement with the pilots. The carrier estimated that it would take 8 to 10 days to get all its planes back in the air once the pilots returned to the cockpit.
The major issues in the strike are pay and job security. Before negotiations broke off on Friday, the union was seeking a 14 percent raise over three years. Northwest's last offer was a 9 percent raise over four years. The union says the pilots' yearly average salary is $120,000; the company says it is $133,000.
Magdalena G. Jacobsen, the chairwoman of the National Mediation Board, who is supervising the negotiations, invited the two sides to meet with her in Chicago on Saturday.
Jim Armshaw, a spokesman for the board, which is an independent Federal agency, said the meeting was not a resumption of negotiations but an effort to see whether there was enough movement on either side for new talks to be productive.
"It is an exploratory meeting," Mr. Armshaw said. "If it can go beyond that, it will."
The meeting was announced a day after Rodney E. Slater, the Secretary of Transportation, met with the chief executive of Northwest, John H. Dasburg, and the president of the Air Line Pilots' Association, J. Randolph Babbitt, separately and together for nearly five hours in his Washington office.
Donald J. Foley, Northwest's vice president for communications, said: "Dasburg made it very clear that ALPA's position on pay is unachievable. They gave no indication that they will move on that. Until they do, we can't do anything."
The pilots restated their position that they were waiting for Northwest to return to the negotiating table.
The Northwest pilots say they helped save the airline from bankruptcy in 1993 when they accepted a 15.5 percent wage cut in exchange for stock along with the other unions.
Since then, Northwest has registered four years of record profits and the airline's executives have cashed in stock options worth tens of millions of dollars, while the pilots' salaries have merely returned to the pay levels before their concessions. After two years of negotiations, the pilots say they are seeking an "industry-leading" contract that would vault them over their counterparts at American Airlines, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines.
The company has said it cannot afford to pay the pilots more than its three larger competitors pay theirs.
In addition to the 14 percent raise, the pilots are seeking a lump sum of $86 million, an end to a two-tier wage scale in which newly hired pilots are paid less than those who have been at the airline for more than five years, and limits on the number of small, regional jets Northwest can add to its fleet.
In addition to the 9 percent wage increase, Northwest has offered a lump sum of $57 million, a reduction of the two-tier wages scale to three years from five, profit sharing and improved pension benefits.
The pilots say the differences between the two offers amount to $70 million a year; the company estimates the difference at $170 million.
But Northwest is also in the midst of negotiating contracts with its five other unions. The airline has said that if it meets the pilots' demands, it will be forced to be equally generous with its other workers, saddling it with high costs at a time when a weakening global economy threatens to end the boom in the airline industry.
The strike has caused fewer problems than many had predicted. Because of the 30-day cooling off period required under the Railway Labor Act before the pilots could walk out, businesses and consumers had more than a month to prepare for life without Northwest.
But if the strike drags on beyond the busy Labor Day holiday, it promises to cause increasing disruption as business people resume heavier travel schedules.
Northwest has repeatedly warned of the disastrous effects of a strike in the hope of convincing President Clinton to intervene. The White House has the power to compel the pilots to return to work for 60 days while an emergency board tries to negotiate a compromise. But Mr. Clinton, who ended a pilots strike at American Airlines last year, has declined to step in.
Northwest said yesterday that it regretted having to lay off its workers. "This is a sad day for Northwest Airlines," Said Dwayne Tucker, Northwest vice president for human resources. "We hoped never to have to exercise this option."
But the pilots accused the company of exaggerating the impact of the strike. The union has also said that there was no reason for Mesaba and Express to stop flying just because Northwest was grounded.
The Transportation Department said that under a Federal program that subsidizes flights to underserved areas, Mesaba and Express are prohibited from suspending service below a minimum level without giving 90 days notice.
Warren R. Wilkinson, a spokesman for Mesaba, which is effectively controlled by Northwest, said that it made no economic sense for the airline to fly without being able to connect passengers to Northwest.
Facing their own negotiations with the company, Northwest's other unions supported the pilots.
"We do stand behind them," said Kathy Jo Smith, a business agent for Local 2000 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents Northwest's 11,000 flight attendants. "They're sort of paving the way for us. We want them to stand hard and firm."
But with thousands of workers losing their jobs, the pressure on both sides to reach a settlement is sure to increase.

HEADLINE: Poughkeepsie Man Linked to Slayings Of Eight Women

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER 

 BODY:
Police investigators wearing face masks and white jump suits found the bodies of two women and the decaying remains of others yesterday in a ramshackle green house a block from Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.
They charged Kendall Francois, a 27-year-old unemployed school aide who lived in the house, with strangling one of the women to death and said they thought he was responsible for killing seven others, most of them prostitutes, who have been missing for as long as two years. 
 "We have reason to believe that ultimately eight bodies will be recovered from our search of the house based on our conversations with him," said William V. Grady, the District Attorney of Dutchess County.
The house, where Mr. Francois lived with his parents and sister, is on a quiet tree-shaded block of gracious Victorians and doctors' offices one block from Vassar. But it is also two blocks in the opposite direction from a stretch of Poughkeepsie's Main Street used by prostitutes, including some who are drug users, to solicit customers. Mr. Francois's parents and sister continued to live in the house at 99 Fulton Avenue, where the bodies and the remains of the women were found, yet law enforcement officials said the family was surprised when told of the murders. Neighbors and a mail carrier said the stench coming from the filthy house -- the paint was peeling, the shrubbery was overgrown and the electricity meter was broken -- had long been unbearable.
Late into the evening, investigators continued to search the Francois house for remains of the other women. Mr. Grady said at least one body was found in the basement, but he would not disclose other locations in the house that he said Mr. Francois had mentioned when interrogated about the missing women on Tuesday night and yesterday.
Mr. Grady said there was no indication that the women had been dismembered.
"He had something to say about all of the missing women," Mr. Grady said of the suspect. Mr. Grady would not say what led the police to Mr. Francois, although other law enforcement officials said Mr. Francois was jailed for 15 days last winter on charges of assaulting a prostitute.
The case is the latest in a sequence of serial murders of street prostitutes during the last two decades. It bore strong similarities to the case of Joel Rifkin, who confessed to killing 17 women he said were prostitutes on Long Island, and to the so-called Green River case, in which 49 women, most of them prostitutes, were slain or vanished in the Seattle area.
The string of missing women has unsettled both the city of Poughkeepsie, a Hudson River manufacturing center with 28,844 residents, and the surrounding township, also named Poughkeepsie, which has a population of 40,143.
The economic vitality of the area has been battered by the closing of a nearby IBM plant and the flight of business from the city's downtown.
Some relatives of the victims complained that until last week, when a task force focusing on the disappearances was formed, the police were not paying enough attention because the victims were prostitutes and drug users.
"If there had been this much press before, I don't think it would have gone this far," said James J. DeSalvo, the brother of Kathleen Hurley, who vanished in January of 1997.
The only body identified yesterday was that of Catina L. Newmaster, 25, who friends said used drugs. She was last seen on Aug. 25 by a boyfriend in nearby Pleasant Valley, who found out that she had traveled to Poughkeepsie.
The first woman reported missing was Wendy Meyers, 30, who was last seen on Oct. 24, 1996, at a motel in nearby Highland. Her disappearance was followed by that of Gina Barone, 29, on Dec. 9, 1996; Catherine A. Marsh, 29, who was pregnant, on Nov. 12, 1996; Ms. Hurley on Jan. 12, 1997; Michelle Eason, 27, on Oct. 9, 1997; Mary Healey Giaccone, 29, on Nov. 13, 1997; Sandra Jean French, 51, on June 11, 1998, and Ms. Newmaster.
Although some lived in the rural towns outside urban Poughkeepsie, four of the women were last seen in the meaner stretches of the city. All except Ms. Hurley had been arrested on prostitution charges.
Mr. Francois, who is 6 feet 4 inches tall and weighs more than 300 pounds, was arraigned yesterday morning before Judge Ira Pergament of the Town of Poughkeepsie court and charged with one count of second-degree murder.
He pleaded not guilty and was assigned a lawyer from the state's Capital Defender Office, which handles cases that might result in a death penalty.
Mr. Francois was born in Poughkeepsie, graduated from high school in the Arlington School District, made up of the town of Poughkeepsie and seven other towns, and served in the United States Army. He may have been on the high school's wrestling team because, when he worked as an aide, he showed students wrestling holds he claimed to have learned in high school competition, said Judy Olmstead Clark, a teaching assistant who worked with him at Arlington Middle School.
He began working at the Arlington Middle School in 1994 as an occasional custodial worker and then from April 1996 to January 1997, he worked full time as a hall monitor at Arlington, making sure that students were not unruly in the halls and the cafeteria. He earned $6 an hour, or roughly $42 for a school day.
When he left Arlington, he told the school administrators that he was going to work for the Anderson School, a school for mentally retarded and other developmentally disabled children in Staatsburg, a 20-minute ride from the city of Poughkeepsie. Officials of that school would not confirm or deny that he had worked there.
Don Rothman, Superintendent of the Arlington School district, said Mr. Francois's years of employment were uneventful.
But Mrs. Clark said many teachers complained that Mr. Francois behaved improperly with some girls, hugging them, playing with their hair, following them in the hall or making off-color jokes.
"I thought he was kind of inappropriate in his appearance, in his demeanor," she said.
There was some relief on the Vassar campus that a suspect had been arrested. Susan DeKrey, director of college relations for Vassar, said that students and faculty members have been aware of the vanishing women, but because the pattern of victims indicated they were drug-using prostitutes, "it did not grip the campus in a panic in that sense."
"But it's very shocking that this has happened in a safe college neighborhood," she said.

Report Says Navy Suffers From Shortage of Sailors

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, Sept. 2

 BODY:
A shortage of thousands of sailors has forced the United States to send several warships to the Persian Gulf without full crews, hurting the ships' preparedness, a newspaper report said today.
Some members of Congress and military analysts said the numbers showed that the Navy was suffering from poor recruiting and retention as a result of low civilian unemployment and a widening pay gap, The San Diego Union-Tribune reported. 
 Pacific units, which included ships and personnel based in San Diego, had 10,716 unfilled jobs because there were not enough sailors, said Adm. Archie Clemins, commander of the Pacific Fleet.
In the Persian Gulf, the aircraft carrier Lincoln had 500 fewer sailors than it had in its last deployment in 1995, the newspaper said.
Officials said most of the Navy's 18,022 unfilled positions were aboard warships, forcing it to deploy most warships at only the second-highest level of readiness.

Finding Something Nice to Say About Microsoft's Operations

BYLINE: By Matt Richtel 

 BODY:
Richard McKenzie and William Shughart don't believe that there should be the Microsoft logo under the word "monopoly" in the dictionary.
The two economists, writing in the fall issue of Independent Review: A Journal of Political Economy, contend that Microsoft's activities have not hindered software competition. In fact, they conclude that it is the Justice Department that is "squelching competition." 
 The review is published by the Independent Institute, a nonprofit research organization in Oakland, Calif., that advocates free markets and less economic control by governments. The institute says Microsoft has a subscription to the Independent Review but does not contribute money to the organization.
Professor McKenzie, of the University of California at Irvine, and Professor Shughart, of the University of Mississippi, wrote that Microsoft could not afford to restrict output and raise prices, as a monopoly would be expected to do. If it did, they argue, competition would immediately jump in to take away the business.
"Its market pricing and product development do not square with those of a monopolist," they said. Their article can be found on the Independent Institute's Web site (www.independent.org).

Clinton Says Aid Will Rise
If Russia Presses Reforms
President Clinton, concluding a summit meeting with President Boris N. Yeltsin, signaled that the West would step up its aid to Russia if it pressed ahead with tough economic reforms. His message was intended to encourage Russia to keep to its pro-capitalist course despite the nation's deepening economic crisis. A1

President Defends Speech On the Lewinsky Matter

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN MOSCOW: THE SCENE;
And Still No Government: Ruble Sags and So Do Spirits

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Sept. 2

 BODY:
Russia struggled through another day without a Government; the ruble's value fell again; people had less money than ever, and spirits and fortunes sagged.
"The situation is worse than in 1917," the year that the Bolsheviks seized power in a country depleted by war and government indecision, Aleksandr I. Lebed, the regional governor with presidential ambitions, said he told President Clinton today. 
 "I told him that the situation in Russia is catastrophic," said Mr. Lebed, a former general, who joined other Russian political leaders this afternoon for a meeting with Mr. Clinton at the residence of the United States ambassador.
Bleak predictions were common in Moscow today, as newspapers and commentators discussed various possibilities -- from dictatorship to armed insurrection -- that could result from the standoff between President Boris N. Yeltsin and his opposition in the lower house of the Russian Parliament.
The lower house is set to meet on Friday afternoon for a second round of voting on the nomination of Viktor S. Chernomyrdin as Prime Minister, five days after his candidacy was rejected the first time. If no political breakthrough occurs before then, and the Parliament rejects Mr. Chernomyrdin a third time, then Mr. Yeltsin is constitutionally bound to disband it and call for new elections.
Moving into the breach today with a presidential decree, Mr. Yeltsin named six acting Cabinet members, including Boris Fyodorov, Russia's tough-talking top tax collector, and the only clear and authoritative voice advocating Western-style remedies for Russia's worsening economic and financial crisis.
At a news conference today, Mr. Fyodorov drew the line at any mass printing of rubles, an option Mr. Yeltsin's opposition pushed in its economic program. Such a course, he said, would only lead to hyperinflation.
"Nobody intends to go down the road to inflation," he said.
Such talk would be reassuring to Mr. Clinton and Russia's other Western allies, who all week have been pressing Moscow to stay the course on economic reform, and not slide back into Soviet-era practices like price controls and excessive state spending.
Blasting the Central Bank for policies that set the stage for the ruble's collapse, Mr. Fyodorov also floated the idea of a currency board, which would impose strict controls on the money supply and which has been used successfully in Argentina, Bulgaria and other countries to steady inflation and restore investor confidence.
Mr. Fyodorov said he would continue to pursue the idea at a meeting on Thursday with Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's former economy minister who presided over a currency board that halted inflation by requiring the central bank to hold one United States dollar for every Argentinian peso in circulation.
But without a Government to carry them out, Mr. Fyodorov's pledges and proposals had a ring of prematurity. "Who can tell me who is going to be Russia's prime minister in a week?" asked a Western official. "That is the question."
Mr. Yeltsin has insisted he will not back off Mr. Chernomyrdin's nomination, although he prevaricated today when the question was put to him at a news conference. Most analysts thought it unlikely that Mr. Yeltsin would be the first to blink in the standoff because any concessions would further embolden his opposition to press for more.
In a radio interview today, Boris Berezovsky, the financier who helped engineer Mr. Chernomyrdin's nomination, suggested that Mr. Yeltsin might ultimately have to resign to allow a strong political figure to emerge in his place. An alternative, he said, would be to create room for a strong political figure who would rule with Mr. Yeltsin, "quietly putting up with the fact that the president cannot, to the necessary degree, take part in the swiftly developing events."
Mr. Berezovsky, in a television interview later, said that he thought Parliament might still be outmaneuvered by the Kremlin, and that Mr. Chernomyrdin's chances of becoming prime minister were not lost.
"Chernomyrdin had a chance," Mr. Berezovsky said. "It's another question how he will use it now. He had a real chance. I still think far from everything has been lost."
Mr. Chernomyrdin picked up support from a group of regional governors, who urged the lower house to act swiftly so that a Government can start putting a program in place. He is due to meet on Thursday with the Parliament's upper house, made up of regional leaders, which has influence, but no power over the formation of governments.
The political paralysis continued to take an economic toll today, as the value of the ruble fell again in electronic interbank trading. Continuing uncertainty about the value of the currency caused major stores to halt credit card transactions, even as their shelves were being emptied of essential goods.
The central bank said today that it was preparing to transfer savings accounts from six major banks to the Government-controlled Sberbank, although in an interview on television tonight, a top bank official said depositors could leave their accounts untouched "if they have faith in their bank."
Another central bank official said in a radio interview that Russia had spent $9 billion in the last two months defending the ruble, and had had no choice now but to let its value float.
"We were hoping that if events took a normal course, the rate could be held without any intervention," said Denis Kiselyov, the deputy bank chairman. "What is happening now in economics and politics can in no way be called a normal course of events."
 

CORRECTION-DATE: September 4, 1998, Friday

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about the political standoff in Moscow used a word erroneously in a description of President Boris N. Yeltsin's news conference comment on the nomination of Viktor S. Chernomyrdin as Prime Minster. The article should have said Mr. Yeltsin equivocated (not prevaricated) when asked about the possibility of a compromise.

HEADLINE: Empire State's Strength

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Elizabeth Kolbert (Metro Matters, Aug. 28) questions the progress New York State's economy has made in the four years since state policies started becoming more friendly to employers. But economic trends in the Empire State are among the strongest in the country. 
 In 1997, for the first time in more than a decade, the state gained manufacturing jobs. Private-sector growth in New York is starting to catch up to that in other states, after years of lagging far behind. In one key industry, construction, we surpassed the national growth rate for the year ending in June. New Census Bureau data show that in 1995 and 1996, manufacturing investment in the state grew 33 percent, to more than $10 billion.

HEADLINE: Don't Expect Russia To Fend for Itself

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In "Let Russia Fend for Itself" (Op-Ed, Aug. 29), Richard Pipes suggests a "hands off" policy toward Russia because for too long, Russians have been relying on external aid to delay putting their house in order. Mr. Pipes's judgment and prescription are excessively harsh. The Russian economy has already experienced substantial reforms. Prices have been freed, foreign trade has been opened up, defense spending has been slashed to around 3 percent of gross domestic product and much industry has been privatized. It is hard to imagine this progress in an atmosphere of a "hands off" policy by the West. 
 The residual but considerable difficulty with reforms has been the inability of successive leaders in the government to persuade the democratically elected but unfortunately Communist-dominated lower house of parliament to go along with building up Russia's fiscal infrastructure by cutting back expenditures and enacting a simplified tax code. But, as students of foreign aid have long known, denial of aid will often imperil rather than induce the adoption of policies we consider desirable. Russia fits that mold.

HEADLINE: Retailers' Sales Strong in August; Analysts Still Wary

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
American retailers reported relatively strong sales for August yesterday, but analysts warned that continued unease in the stock market and in the global economy could slow down retail sales for the rest of the year.
"It is obviously premature to make a call," said Jeffrey Feiner, a retail analyst at Lehman Brothers. "But certainly the volatility in the market and in the economic outlook is likely to cause some slowing in consumer spending. Some companies have been talking about gradually scaling back orders for Christmas." 
 Retailers enjoyed strong sales increases over the summer, and August was no exception. Same-store sales, or sales in stores open at least a year, rose 3.5 percent in August compared with the month a year earlier, according to the Goldman, Sachs retail composite index.
Leading the way were discount stores, which have enjoyed two years of exceptional sales. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. reported a 7.6 percent gain, while Target, a unit of the Dayton Hudson Corporation, said sales rose 4.9 percent. Sales at Dollar General rose 7.1 percent.
Off-price apparel retailers, which have also been strong performers for several quarters, saw sales slow a bit last month, perhaps because they had lofty numbers with which to compare. Ross Stores, for example, said sales rose only 2 percent, while Value City saw sales fall 1.8 percent. The TJX Company reported a sales gain of 1 percent.
Among all retailers, department stores continued to be the real laggards. Sales at Sears, Roebuck & Company fell three-tenths of 1 percent, and sales at Federated Department Stores Inc. fell 1.3 percent.
The May Department Stores Company said sales dropped seven-tenths of 1 percent in August, and Dillard Department Stores reported a 1 percent decrease. Neiman Marcus, a unit of Harcourt General Inc., said sales fell 1.7 percent. Only Saks Fifth Avenue reported a respectable sales increase -- 7.1 percent.
"Department stores have been weak all year," said Richard N. Baum, a retail analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company. "They are losing share to specialty apparel retailers, who are executing better this year than last year. And then you've got the discount department stores moving their offerings more upscale, like Target, which is siphoning off business as well."
Indeed, among specialty apparel merchants, Ann Taylor Stores said sales rose 15.5 percent, and Gap Inc.'s sales rose 9 percent. The Limited Inc.'s sales blossomed 7 percent, thanks in large part to improvements at its Express and Limited women's chains.
Retailers may also have given some of August's sales to September because of the late Labor Day. "There was some pretty strong evidence that business in the Northwest and Southeast, where back to school is earlier, was better for the month than in the Northeast," Mr. Baum said. "So we don't yet have the full picture of back to school. We think September will be a strong month, and we'll have to look at the two together."

HEADLINE: Small Gain Seen In Productivity

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 3

 BODY:
Growth in American workers' productivity, the key to rising living standards, slowed in the last quarter, which ended in June, and posted the smallest gain in nearly two years.
The productivity of nonfarm, nonsupervisory workers, measured as output per hour of work, rose at a one-tenth of 1 percent annual rate, the Labor Department said today. 
 That was better than expected from preliminary figures, released last month, which indicated that productivity had fallen two-tenths of 1 percent.
The weakness this April through June followed a healthy 3.5 percent increase in productivity for the first three months of this year.
Fast productivity growth allows employers to raise wages and earn increased profits without raising product prices.
In a separate report today, the Labor Department said that first-time applications for unemployment benefits rose only slightly last week, by 1,000, to a seasonally adjusted 302,000. A four-week moving average of claims, which economists consider even more telling, fell to 302,250, its lowest level in a year.

HEADLINE: In Wake of Strikes, G.M. Posts August Sales Drop

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS 

 BODY:
Still struggling with the aftermath of two strikes, the General Motors Corporation reported yesterday that car and light-truck sales fell 36.4 percent in August. At the same time, the Ford Motor Company reported a stronger-than-expected 8.1 percent increase in sales.
G.M.'s lower sales pushed the industry down even though nearly all auto companies selling vehicles in the United States reported higher sales. Vehicle sales for the month totaled 1,229,989 cars and light trucks, a decrease of 6.6 percent compared with sales in the month a year earlier. 
 A total of 675,173 cars were sold, down 8.8 percent, and truck sales were off 3.8 percent at 554,816. The seasonally adjusted selling rate dipped to 14.6 million cars and light trucks after running at a rate of more than 16 million for the last three months.
"Considering the G.M. strike and the expiration of the loyalty coupons," incentives that ran from April to July, "these are very strong numbers," said David Healy, an auto analyst for Burnham Securities in New York.
G.M. sold 271,177 cars and light trucks during the month, a 36.4 percent decline compared with sales in August 1997. Car sales were 156,876, down 37.4 percent, and light-truck sales totaled 112,362, down 35 percent. Sales of nearly every model in G.M.'s line dropped 30 percent to 40 percent. The largest sales declines were in vehicles with the lowest inventories, such as full-size sport utility vehicles.
Nearly all of G.M.'s North American assembly operations were closed for 54 days in June and July because of strikes by the United Automobile Workers at two parts plants in Flint, Mich. G.M.'s plants are now operating on overtime to push inventory levels back to normal in October.
More than 60 percent of G.M.'s August sales came in the last 10 days of the month. The level of sales in those 10 days were close to the level of sales in the last 10 days of August 1997. For the year so far, G.M.'s vehicle sales trail 1997 sales by 5 percent.
At Ford, sales were stronger than analysts expected. Ford reported that its Ford, Mercury, Lincoln and Jaguar divisions sold 323,599 cars and light trucks in August, an 8.1 percent increase compared with figures from August 1997. Ford sold 129,527 cars, up 1.3 percent from a year earlier, and 189,809 light trucks, up 13.2 percent, a new industry record for monthly truck sales.
Nearly every major vehicle manufacturer reporting sales this week experienced higher sales in August compared with those in the month a year earlier; some set records.
Sales for the Chrysler Corporation were up 3.5 percent. Toyota reported its best August ever for its Toyota and Lexus brands, up 10.9 percent. Sales of Mercedes-Benz, a unit of Daimler-Benz, rose 75.8 percent, and BMW sales increased by 5.2 percent. Volkswagen A.G. had its best August in 17 years, with a 71.3 percent increase in sales, passing full-year sales for 1997. Its Audi brand enjoyed its best August since 1986, with sales up 37.7 percent. Volvo sales increased 8.5 percent, and Porsche A.G. sales jumped 134.7 percent.
Subaru of America had its best August since 1989, with a 9.3 percent increase in sales. Mazda had its best month since March 1995, with sales up 37.8 percent. Kia Motors America reported sales up 26.8 percent, and Nissan sales rose 2.9 percent. Isuzu sales rose 5.7 percent.
Most automotive executives and automotive analysts predict the industry will close the year on a high note despite the roller-coaster behavior of the stock market and the Asian financial crisis. Forecasts generally indicate 1998 car and light-truck sales will be about 15.5 million units, which would be the fifth consecutive year of more than 15 million units sold.

HEADLINE: Latin America Tells I.M.F. Economies Are Sound

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 3

 BODY:
Fearful of being swept up in the financial turmoil that has devastated Asia and Russia, officials from nine Latin American nations said today that their economies were basically sound and should not be penalized indiscriminately by panicky investors.
Arriving for the start of a two-day meeting with the International Monetary Fund, the officials said that they were not seeking any international financial help, and that they were taking the difficult steps needed to weather a storm that is threatening to batter much of the world. 
 "Latin America is doing its homework," the Finance Minister of Mexico, Jose Angel Gurria, said. "Markets are certainly overreacting and not discriminating at all. Everyone is thrown in the same basket."
The Clinton Administration praised the progress of many Latin American countries. Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, arriving for the meeting, said that what transpires in the region was profoundly important to the United States and that many Latin governments had "accomplished a great deal."
Investors paid little heed to those messages. Financial markets across Latin America fell sharply today, one day after Colombia devalued its currency. Moody's Investors Service, the credit-rating agency, downgraded its rating of Brazil's foreign-currency debt, setting off an 8.6 percent decline in the main stock-market index there.
The worries about Latin America are growing as Mr. Rubin prepared to meet on Friday in San Francisco with Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of Japan. Mr. Rubin is expected to keep the pressure on Japan to strengthen its banking system and do more to pull its economy out of the doldrums and help the rest of Asia.
To the degree that the global financial unrest spreads through Latin America, it will only increase the risks to the American economy and to investors on Wall Street, where there is wide concern that corporate earnings will suffer as growth slows or evaporates in Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and other big markets.
Analysts said the combination of Latin America's checkered economic history and the current turmoil in global markets all but assured that the region was in for a bumpy ride at a time when investors are looking for the safest places to put their money.
"This is a region with high external debt numbers and a history of default in a world that's currently experiencing a flight to quality," Phil Suttle, an international economist at J. P. Morgan in New York, said. "In that situation it's a tough world for Latin America."
Officials from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela attended the meeting, along with Mr. Rubin and Finance Minister Paul Martin of Canada.
Some analysts said the fund's unstated agenda might have been to warn the Latin nations not to expect much help if they ran into trouble, because the I.M.F. has been warning for months that it is running short of money to finance further bailouts.
But I.M.F. officials said they would make clear to the Latin nations that money would be there to support countries that took the necessary difficult steps to whip their economies and financial systems into shape.

HEADLINE: Chief U.N. Inspector Reports More Interference by Iraq

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 3

 BODY:
The chief United Nations weapons inspector for Iraq said today that the Government of Saddam Hussein had gone beyond its decision to block surprise inspections and is now interfering with routine monitoring operations.
The inspector, Richard Butler, told the Security Council about the deteriorating situation in Iraq as the United States and Britain moved to keep comprehensive sanctions on the Iraqis until they resume cooperation. 
 The two nations introduced a resolution today condemning Iraq and putting future sanctions reviews on hold. The measure is expected to be voted on next week, probably after more negotiations with Iraq's supporters, the Russians and Chinese. Security Council members will study the draft resolution over the next few days.
Mr. Butler, chairman of the United Nations Special Commission, said today that he had been able to carry out only the increasingly circumscribed activities that Iraq permitted.
"It is less than the whole monitoring program," he told reporters. "We are doing no disarmament work."
Mr. Butler told the Council that Iraq had blocked the commission on three occasions since Aug. 5, when the Iraqis stopped allowing new on-site inspections and said they would allow only long-term surveillance and monitoring of previously designated sites.
In the second week of August, Mr. Butler said, the Iraqis refused information about and access to equipment used for test-launching their Samoud missile, saying it was outside the mandate of the commission, known as Unscom.
On Aug. 16, inspectors were told that they could not return to a previously visited site because it was a military area. The Iraqis had threatened in the past to exclude all military sites, which would in effect gut large parts of the inspection program.
On Sept. 1, Iraqis barred inspectors from a place where missile parts had been tagged and stored by Unscom for further observation. Iraq said the area was not a "declared site," a distinction that appears to have been turned into a new reason for denying access.
In all such cases, refusals of access raise suspicions that the material sought may have been removed and possibly returned to use in prohibited weapons programs. Iraq must abolish all chemical, biological, nuclear and certain missile systems as well as the means of producing them for sanctions to end. With no support for military action to enforce Baghdad's compliance, however, Iraq and the Security Council appear to be settling in for a long standoff, or another mediation effort by the Secretary General.
British and American diplomats are banking on the growth of what one envoy called "a rising tide" against the Iraqis, who have been confident for a year that sanctions will be gone by the end of 1998. The Russians and Chinese, however, have continued to argue for including encouraging overtures to Iraq, hoping that rewards for cooperation will budge Baghdad in ways that threats will not.
The British and American resolution introduced today makes a gesture in that direction, saying the Council will "respond favorably to future progress made in the disarmament process."
But some diplomats say that this does not go far enough, and that if the Council had rewarded Iraq in July by closing the nuclear inspection file and switching to long-term monitoring, Iraq might not have become so obstructive a month later.
Some Chinese, Russian and other diplomats also favor a review of relations with Iraq and possibly a restructuring of Unscom, following Iraqi accusations that Mr. Butler and his inspectors have overstepped their authority.
The criticisms of Unscom and Mr. Butler were resurrected after an American inspector, William Scott Ritter Jr., resigned from the commission, accusing the Security Council and Secretary General Kofi Annan of giving ground to the Iraqis.
Bill Richardson, the United States representative, said in an interview on Monday before accompanying President Clinton to Moscow, where Iraq was discussed among aides from both sides, that he saw no likelihood of changes in Unscom, especially at the top.
"Butler is safe because of his strong relationship with the Secretary General," Mr. Richardson said. "It's in the best interests of the Security Council and the U.N. to keep such a credible independent force like Butler doing his job. I think that despite this latest scuffle, Butler has improved his standing with other Security Council members besides Britain and the United States."
Mr. Richardson said Mr. Annan has been much more supportive of Mr. Butler behind the scenes than many believe to be the case.
The shift in American policy from threatening Iraq militarily to building a diplomatic front against Baghdad in the Security Council has been welcomed by some pivotal members.
"I think it was a blessing," said Antonio Monteiro, Portugal's representative and the chairman of the Council's Iraq sanctions committee. "Unilateral actions are very dangerous. We have enough anger in the world. Why do we want to provoke more gaps between us in the Western world and the Arabs? If we can contain Iraq in a reasonable way, and I believe we can, is that not better than using force?"
Mr. Monteiro and several other envoys said there is no nation that wants to tolerate Iraqi defiance or allow Iraq to escape sanctions unilaterally, despite all its grievances.
"First they comply," Mr. Monteiro said of the Iraqis. "Then we see what we can do to take them on board."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
The 30-Year Treasury Price Moves Higher

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Bonds continued to benefit from the turbulence in stocks yesterday, managing a modest gain.
Investor demand for United States Government securities recently, especially for the shorter maturities, has been tied to the rise and fall of the nation's and overseas stock markets. With stocks down yesterday, still in reaction to the unresolved economic crisis in Russia and turbulence in the global financial markets, bonds were up. 
 The 30-year bond rose 15/32 , to 103. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction, was down to 5.30 percent, from 5.33 percent on Wednesday.
The bond market was poised for the release of the August jobless report today. Analysts forecast a gain of 370,000 new jobs last month. One estimate was even higher, calling for a gain of as many as 500,000 new jobs.
The Department of Labor released its weekly report on first-time applications for jobless benefits yesterday for the week ended last Saturday. The data rose only slightly, indicating that the labor market was still tight. Claims were up 1,000, to 302,000. The four-week average of claims -- which economists consider more reliable -- fell to 302,250, its lowest level in a year.
Robert Pugliese, senior vice president and director of fixed income at J. W. Charles Securities Inc. in Boca Raton, Fla., said: "The long and the short of it today is that bonds are trading inversely to the Dow.
"As for the August employment data being released on Friday, I have no apprehension about the number. I think that all of the positive factors have been factored in at these market price levels."
Keeping in mind what happened to stocks, he is being cautious about bonds: "I get a little apprehensive when I hear analysts say bonds are going to go up in price. It makes me a little nervous. That's why I think any surprise in the employment numbers tomorrow could just as easily be a negative for Treasuries. The only reason the bond market traded higher today is because of the turmoil in the equity markets."
Bonds were further bolstered in the afternoon by late buying linked to the Moody's Investors Service downgrading of Brazil's foreign currency debt rating to B-2 from B-1.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
Staten Island Co-op Project Is Priced for Moderate Incomes

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
Construction will start this month on 74 town house-style co-ops on Staten Island that are part of a new city program to provide housing that is affordable to people who earn as little as $30,000 a year.
The program makes the two- and three-bedroom apartments affordable by using city subsidies, a project-wide mortgage with a low interest rate and an abatement on property taxes. 
 The shares in the residences, with 1,000 to 1,700 square feet of space, will sell for $5,695 to $6,845, and the apartments will also have monthly carrying charges -- including mortgage payments, insurance and taxes -- of $885 to $1,054. The town houses will be offered to people with annual incomes that do not exceed $70,000.
Groundbreaking on the co-op project will be on Sept. 15, and the 74 town houses will be built over the next 15 months on the north shore of Staten Island in Fox Hills, near the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. Sales will begin in October.
The town houses are the latest phase of a 23-acre development along Osgood Avenue called Celebration at Rainbow Hill that eventually will have 600 residences. So far 380 units have been built and sold, all of them fee-simple town houses, meaning the buyers own the town houses and the land underneath them.
The new units, like the earlier ones, are being developed by R. Randy Lee, president of the Leewood Real Estate Group of Bulls Head, with Ralph Zurlo, Michael Boccieri and Eugene Boccieri. They are all builders on Staten Island.
Mr. Lee said the partners switched to the cooperative form of ownership to be eligible for the city's Middle-Income Housing Loan Program, which provides financing only to rentals and to what are known as limited equity co-ops, meaning there are limits on how the co-ops can be resold. Both the rental and the co-op components of the program have income eligibility requirements. The co-op component limits the profits that buyers can make when they sell their units. A portion of the profit on each unit must be used to repay the city for its subsidies.
The earlier units at Celebration at Rainbow Hill, also intended to be affordable to middle-income buyers, were subsidized with money from the New York State Affordable Housing Corporation. But much of the money from this program is now going to city-sponsored projects. Mr. Lee said the city's new loan program "became the most viable alternative."
Under the program, the New York City Housing Development Corporation issues taxable bonds to provide construction loans with interest rates that are below the market rates and permanent financing to builders, or both. The builders are also eligible for a 25-year tax abatement from the city. The corporation, using its own reserves, also offers a subsidy of up to $20,000 per unit in the form of a second mortgage at an interest rate of 1 percent to 3 percent for 30 years.
"We saw a real need for additional support for middle-income housing," said Richard T. Roberts, who is chairman of the board of the housing corporation and commissioner of the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development.
The Staten Island project shows how the financing works. Celebration at Rainbow Hill received $8 million in bond financing at an interest rate of 7.5 percent and a loan of $15,000 per unit, or $1.1 million, at an interest rate of 1 percent. Combining the two interest rates produced a 30-year project-wide mortgage at an interest rate of less than 6.5 percent, Mr. Lee said. As a result the units are affordable to people making as little as $30,000 a year, he said.
Since the program began last October, eight projects, totaling 850 units, have been approved, and six projects, with 230 units, have been proposed, Mr. Roberts said. Among the projects are a 132-unit rental complex being built on Austin Street in Rego Park, Queens, and a 90-unit rental complex to begin this month on Degraw Street in the Carroll Gardens section of Brooklyn.
Discussions are under way for a second round of the program, Mr. Roberts said, and a decision is expected in the next two to three months.
The Staten Island project is distinctive because even though it offers the cooperative form of ownership, it is structured as a condominium, Mr. Lee said. The 74 units will be owned by a cooperative apartment corporation in which residents will buy shares, and those shares will entitle them to a proprietary lease to occupy their units. In condominiums, a purchaser buys an apartment and an interest in the common area.
But the bylaws will be like those of a condominium: Owners will be able to buy and sell their units without the approval of the board of directors they elect. (Under the program, the units must be occupied by owners who meet the income requirements.) Buyers will also join the homeowners' association and pay a $59 monthly fee to take care of common areas.
In addition, Mr. Lee said, the units will be the same sizes as the other 380 town houses and have the same brick and stucco facades and vinyl siding. Each will also have small yards in front and back that buyers will maintain, and some will have one-car garages.
On Staten Island, housing prices have risen an average of 10 percent over the last year, but are beginning to level off, said Thomas Maira, who runs Maira Real Estate in Huguenot. Depending on the location, prices range from $179,000 to $219,000 for semiattached, single-family houses, and from $279,000 to $359,000 for one- and two-family houses that stand alone, which are the most popular types of houses, he said.
There are few cooperatives, Mr. Maira noted, adding, "You never know how Staten Islanders will take to them." But in Fox Hills, the 74 co-ops "fill a need for affordable housing and extend to the public another form of ownership," he said.
Mr. Lee conceded that marketing the units will be a challenge because of their co-op form of ownership. "But it is one we can meet because of the affordability of the units and the desirability of the development," he said.

HEADLINE: U.N. Arms Inspector Who Quit Is Told He Can't Make Policy

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 3

 BODY:
Senate Democrats mounted a careful counterattack today against the American who resigned in protest last month from the weapons inspection team in Iraq.
The senior inspector, William Scott Ritter Jr., repeated his charges today that the Clinton Administration had blocked efforts by United Nations inspectors to ferret out Iraq's clandestine biological, chemical, nuclear and missile programs, even as Washington publicly supported the inspections. 
 At a rare joint Senate hearing, Democrats praised Mr. Ritter's dedication and candor, and even agreed with his frustration over the Administration decision to seek a diplomatic resolution rather than confront Iraq when Baghdad stymied inspectors.
But Democrats also said using military force to compel Iraq to allow the inspections was a complicated political and diplomatic decision that was not up to Mr. Ritter.
"That responsibility to take the nation to war is above your pay grade," said Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee.
Senator Charles S. Robb, Democrat of Virginia, told Mr. Ritter, "I admire your singlemindedness, even though I may disagree with you on the big picture."
Partisan politics infused the hearing of the Armed Services and Foreign Relations committees. Democrats temporarily blocked the hearing even before it started, arguing that senior Administration witnesses who could rebut Mr. Ritter were out of the country, traveling with Mr. Clinton.
To allow the hearing to proceed, Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, put the Senate in recess and took the unusual step of escorting Mr. Ritter to the witness table in the packed hearing room.
"I wanted to show my support for a man of courage," Mr. Lott said in an interview later.
The hearing was held as the Republican-controlled Congress is growing increasingly critical of the Administration's handling of foreign policy crises like Iraq, North Korea and the International Monetary Fund.
"We are again at a serious crisis point with Iraq," Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana, said. "No one appears to be quarterbacking a game plan in which intrusive inspections continue and produce results."
Mr. Ritter, 37, a former Marine intelligence officer, has said that from last November to August, the Administration made at least seven efforts to stymie an investigation by the United Nations Special Commission, known as Unscom, which is charged with destroying Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
"The United States has undermined Unscom's efforts through interference and manipulation, usually coming from the highest levels of the Administration's national security team," Mr. Ritter said, citing Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, in particular.
Mr. Ritter said the United States; the United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, and the Security Council were complicit in the decision to avoid a confrontation with Iraq, to maintain the embattled international sanctions against Baghdad.
"Iraq provokes a confrontation, knowing there will be no consensus in the Security Council and knowing they'll get a concession," Mr. Ritter said.
He added that two separate inspections, one in July and another in August, were canceled, despite "hard intelligence" about the locations of ballistic-missile components and information about how Iraq was concealing other forbidden weapons.
Without an aggressive inspections program, Mr. Ritter testified, Iraq could rebuild its nuclear, chemical and biological arsenals in six months. Iraq, he added, possessed the components for three nuclear weapons and lacked only the necessary fissionable material to complete the bombs.
Administration officials insisted today that they still supported the United Nations inspections, but reserved the right to weigh the projected gains from any inspections against the political and diplomatic downside.
"We respect this guy," an Administration official said of Mr. Ritter. "But the U.S. is given a fair amount of information. And the moments are rare when an inspection goes for something like this and is successful."
Republicans and Democrats voiced agreement that Mr. Ritter had forced Congress and the Administration to review policies on Iraq and to examine whether they had the stomach to use force, even unilaterally, to back up the inspections.
"We're going to have to make some fundamental decisions about whether to follow a policy of containment or deprive Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction," said Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts.

HEADLINE: Development Claims a Harlem Sculpture

BYLINE: By BARBARA STEWART 

 BODY:
To some, the enormous skeletal structure along the Hudson River in Harlem was an eyesore that took up valuable space. To others, it was the perfect mix of art and utility, a sculpture that had been adopted by children who used it as a jungle gym.
Whatever it was -- scaffolding or sculpture -- it is now history. This week workers dismantled the 75-foot-high pipe-and-concrete structure that for a decade stretched from 125th Street three blocks north along the Harlem waterfront -- puzzling many people who could not determine its purpose. 
 The New York City Economic Development Corporation, which owns the property the steel skeleton sat on, had planned months ago to remove it to prepare the site for renovation by a private developer, said Steve Jacobs, a project manager. The agency, which began soliciting proposals in June for the renovation of the West Harlem waterfront site, will select a plan after Sept. 30, he said.
Yesterday morning, the concrete disks and rusty pipes of the structure were scattered beside the rotting piers along the river. To people familiar with the structure, including commuters who could see its pointed arches from the West Side Highway, its destruction was either the act of art-blind boors or long overdue.
Erected 10 years ago, it was originally draped with silver streamers, pink and fuchsia banners and twinkling lights.
"People came and sat and fished and there were jazz concerts," said Maritta Dunn, the chairwoman of Community Board 9. Commissioned by the Harlem Urban Development Corporation, now defunct, the structure, Ms. Dunn said, was intended to offer Harlem residents an instant, inexpensive substitute for a long-planned but ill-fated $400 million waterfront renovation project.
Rod Knox, the Cooper Union architecture professor who designed and oversaw the building of the structure, said the metal frame was constructed in six weeks for $225,000. He kept the cost down by using discarded sewer pipes and old railroad ties and hiring unemployed local residents to build it.
"It was a wonderful experiment in architecture," he said.
But to Ken Sutherland, 51, a retired police officer who regularly fishes from the piers, calling it art is taking things a bit too far. "That was just a rusted old thing," he said.
In recent years, the structure was primarily used by children, who climbed and swung on it.
The reason for its hasty removal was "concern for the safety of the children," said Janel Patterson, an agency spokeswoman.
Ms. Dunn said she would like the city to provide temporary play equipment to replace the structure. But she said she was pleased that it was finally being removed, heralding the renovation of the property.
She envisions a park, restaurants and clubs. "A fantastic oasis," she said. Removing the structure was the first step, she said.
"It was never art," she added. "It was scaffolding."
But for a few people, the sight of the looming, airy structure was an aesthetic thrill, an oasis in itself, and its destruction something to mourn. "It was a marvelous, magical piece," said John Hejdek, dean of Cooper Union's architecture department. "It added to the landscape and mystery of the city."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Stocks Take Broad Plunge; Dow Off 100

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
Stock prices headed broadly lower yesterday as investors continued to show nervousness about the effects of a possible global economic slowdown on the profits of American companies.
Shares of financial and transportation companies, which would be among those hurt worst by a decline in global business activity, fell most sharply in a volatile day of trading. Also posting declines were companies like Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble and Gillette, which get large percentages of their revenue from overseas. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 100.15 points, or 1.3 percent, to 7,682.22. It was the sixth loss in seven days for the Dow, and other market indexes followed it lower. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 8.21 points, or slightly less than 1 percent, to 982.26, while the Nasdaq composite index declined 20.99, or 1.3 percent, to 1,571.86.
The decline in American stocks followed further losses in European markets, where the fallout from the financial instability in Russia, including further drops in the value of the ruble, dragged down share prices. Germany's most-watched stock market index fell more than 3 percent, while the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 index in London fell 2.2 percent, closing below the level at which it started the year.
The weakness in the economies of Asia and, more recently, Russia, have led many American analysts to cut their estimates of corporate earnings here. Chuck Hill, director of research for First Call, which tracks earnings estimates, said yesterday that analysts' projections of growth in 1998 operating earnings for the companies in the S.& P. 500 index had declined to 5.3 percent in recent days, from a previous level of 5.7 percent.
In the last two months, estimates of third-quarter profit growth have plunged to 2.1 percent from 10 percent. In addition, Mr. Hill said, many analysts are still predicting that fourth-quarter profits will rise more than 10 percent. He expects those forecasts to be revised downward, causing overall profit estimates to fall as well.
Yesterday, the last half-hour of trading again proved to be the most volatile part of the day. But whereas stock prices had been falling sharply in the final minutes of trading in several previous sessions, the Dow moved higher yesterday as the blue chips cut their losses in half in the last 30 minutes of trading.
While some of those sharp swings have come from the implementation of sophisticated trading strategies, traders attributed the late-day gain yesterday to positive comments about the strength of the United States economy by the Treasury Secretary, Robert E. Rubin. Mr. Rubin was scheduled to meet today with the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, and the Japanese Finance Minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, in California.
Also today, traders will be watching the August employment data, which they hope will give some hint whether the domestic economy has begun to feel any effects from the year-old Asian malaise.
"You can see the worries in the price of cyclical stocks, the transportation stocks and shares of plain old-fashioned industrial companies," said Jonathan Olesky, head of block trading at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Company. "People are concerned about a possible downturn in the U.S. that would have been Asian-induced. I think people are going to be very concerned if they see a jump in unemployment." Analysts generally expect the unemployment rate to remain steady at 4.5 percent.
As such, investors are likely to see continued volatility in the stock market, "as long as everybody is focused on daily economic numbers," said Robert Freedman, chief investment officer for the John Hancock Funds.
Shares of bank and financial-service companies continued to take a pounding yesterday as investors reacted to disclosures of losses by many of the big banks. Citicorp fell 10 1/4, to 98 1/2; Chase Manhattan slumped 5 5/8, to 49 1/4; American Express lost 6 1/2, to 77 1/4, and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter fell 5 3/8, to 53 5/8.
Also losing ground yesterday were the economically sensitive transportation stocks, which include airline and trucking companies. Ryder Systems fell 215/16 , to 20, while Roadway Express dropped 17/16 , to 12 3/4. Shares of airline companies fell across the board, with Delta Air Lines dropping 2 3/8, to 957/16 , and UAL, the parent of United Airlines, slipping 3 1/8, to 58 3/4.
One difference between this year's stock market turmoil and past periods of volatility, like those in 1987 or 1990, stock traders say, is that they now have a far harder time gauging the mood of the market from day to day and minute to minute.
Michael Molnar, a managing director in the retail sales and trading operations of Salomon Smith Barney, said that as his firm's trading operations had become more computerized, the volume of background noise in the trading room had become far less reliable as an indicator of market swings.
Where a decade ago traders spent much of their day shouting orders across the floor, today they spend more time punching buttons on computer terminals. "If you want to measure the psychology of the market, you have to watch an individual stock," Mr. Molnar said.
Mr. Molnar, who in 1987 worked at Lehman Brothers, says that in times like this, sentiment can be as crucial as some fundamental measures of value. Referring to the famed proponents of the objective method of investing based on a company's underlying value, he said: "If the market is going to snap back 100 points, that's not Graham and Dodd. That's sentiment."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: A Tiger in a Sea of Pussy Cats;
Trinidad and Tobago Bids Goodbye to Oil, Hello to Gas

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad and Tobago

 BODY:
The flights coming in from the United States are so jam-packed with oil and chemical company executives hungry for a piece of the action here that reservations are hard to come by. Almost weekly, it seems, the Government has some natural gas find or new factory project at the booming Point Lisas Industrial Estate to announce.
While much of the rest of the English-speaking Caribbean worries about making ends meet, this twin-island nation, almost evenly divided between citizens of African and Indian descent, is experiencing a burst of investment and growth. Thanks to the belated realization that its substantial natural gas reserves may prove to be even more valuable than its oil, Trinidad is rapidly emerging as the region's foremost economic success story. 
 Since the beginning of the boom less than five years ago, the 50 American companies now operating here have invested more than $4 billion, a remarkable figure in a country with only 1.3 million people. Seeking to take advantage of cheap and abundant energy supplies, petroleum, chemical and steel companies from Britain, Canada, Germany, India, Norway and Spain are also flocking here.
In the process, "this country is becoming industrialized" and turning into a Caribbean tiger, said Krishna Persad, a leading Trinidadian oil and gas industry consultant. "If only 50 percent of what is being talked about actually comes to pass, you're going to be seeing a Singapore in the Western Hemisphere," he predicted.
But as Government officials here acknowledge, they must also resist the temptation to spend too much too soon and risk overheating the economy. Administering a bonanza, while more pleasant than coping with scarcity, offers hazards of its own. For confirmation of that, Trinidad need only look at its own recent past, or neighboring Venezuela, where billions of dollars in oil profits are said to have been squandered or pilfered.
At the moment, though, "This country is booming, going gangbusters, and the boom is nowhere near peaking," a diplomat here exulted. "With all the recent finds and the plants coming on line, you're going to see a substantial level of activity for the next several years."
In 1997, Trinidad's economy grew by 4 percent, compared with a 1.5 percent contraction in 1993; over the same period, inflation has dropped to 3.8 percent from 13 percent. Income per capita, adjusted for inflation, has risen to $4,290 from $3,920.
Fueling the boom are Trinidad's proven natural gas reserves of more than 21 trillion cubic feet, up from 8.9 trillion just five years ago. David Wight, president of the Amoco Energy Company of Trinidad and Tobago, the local subsidiary of the American oil and gas giant, said that figure was likely to double yet again, while Mr. Persad predicted reserves could eventually reach 75 trillion cubic feet.
"Whatever the numbers turn out to be, they are big, comparable to anywhere in the world," Mr. Wight said. "Trinidad has already become a very big and active player, both in terms of natural gas resources and the downstream side, offering development opportunities here in-country and also significant export opportunities."
The natural gas discoveries have coincided with a downturn in oil production as Trinidad's proven crude reserves dwindle. Output has dropped from a peak of 225,000 barrels a day in the late 1970's, when oil accounted for 80 percent of the country's export income, to 130,000 barrels; at current rates of production, existing reserves will be exhausted in little more than a decade.
But with oil prices in decline and now "at their lowest level in a dozen years," explained Finbar Gangar, Minister of Energy and Energy Industries, "we have consciously diversified our economy away from oil." The basic strategy of the Government of Prime Minister Basdeo Panday, which took power late in 1995, has been "to widen and deepen our industrialization thrust," Mr. Gangar said.
As a result, this Delaware-sized nation at the southeastern tip of the Caribbean, just seven miles off the coast of Venezuela, is already the second-largest exporter of ammonia and methanol in the world. By the end of next year, when the last of five plants built here during the last five years comes on stream, it is expected to become the largest exporter of both those key industrial products.
"If you stand back and look at the broad picture, you can identify four major industrial thrusts," Mr. Persad said. "Gas is being used as raw material for petrochemicals, as fuel for steel plants, as fuel for aluminum projects, and is being liquefied and exported."
In addition to the methanol and ammonia complexes, plants that will produce urea, ethylene, fertilizers and other industrial chemicals are completed or under construction, many of them at the Point Lisas Industrial Estate on the coast south of here. The Indian steel company Ispat already has one plant here and has committed to another, Government officials said. Negotiations are under way with Brazilian interests to refine iron ore mined in the Amazon and with other foreign investors interested in building an aluminum smelter here.
"Brazil, Guyana, Jamaica and Suriname have no shortage of supply of the raw materials required" for such plants, Mr. Gangar said. "It's a welcome bit of synergy when countries in the immediate geographic region have vast supplies of raw materials and Trinidad and Tobago can supply the energy."
The country's showcase project is the $1 billion Atlantic L.N.G. Company of Trinidad and Tobago complex in southern Trinidad, which officials here say is the largest single industrial investment ever made in the Caribbean. Amoco has taken a one-third interest in the project, joined as partners by British Gas, a unit of Centrica; Repsol of Spain; Cabot L.N.G. Ltd., and the state-run National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago Ltd., and is already talking of expansion early in the next century.
Production of three million tons a year of liquefied natural gas is scheduled to begin in the second quarter of next year, with the bulk of production initially scheduled to go to Spain. But some output is also intended for New England, where, as Amoco's Mr. Wight noted, "the wintertime demand for energy far exceeds the pipeline capacity." Trinidad would be the closest supplier of L.N.G.
Since Trinidad and Tobago achieved independence from Britain in 1962, Amoco has traditionally been the dominant player here. But the Panday Government, in what one diplomat described as an effort to increase its leverage, has adopted "a conscious policy of avoiding overdependence on any one company." That has led the Government to award several recent offshore drilling contracts to Amoco's main rivals.
Amoco's share of total production here has dropped to 60 percent from 80 percent, according to Government estimates, and is likely to continue to fall. But Mr. Wight said his company was more than satisfied with its situation, in part because "we've had a high degree of exploratory success."
That track record, he explained, has "elicited a huge amount of competition. Everyone is here now," including ARCO; Conoco, a unit of Du Pont; Exxon; Royal Dutch/Shell, and Texaco.
The uncertainties of international politics have also lent a hand. For European energy companies like Repsol of Spain, countries like Algeria and Nigeria may be closer, but domestic turmoil and widespread corruption in those energy-rich countries have made Trinidad a more attractive place to invest.
"Ours is not the cheapest gas on the market," acknowledged Frank Look Kin, president of the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago. "But we believe we have the advantage of a legal system based on British law and a high degree of honesty and transparency."
Mr. Wight agreed. "We're still working from contracts and concessions that date from independence," he said, which have not been tinkered with or renegotiated despite several changes of government. "That is rare and really important to a businessman."
There are also huge reserves of natural gas, seven times larger than Trinidad's, in nearby Venezuela. But the leading candidate in the presidential election there later this year, Hugo Chavez, has threatened to review contracts with foreign oil companies, leading to suggestions by many executives that Trinidad would be the best place to process not just local gas reserves, but also those of Venezuela, which are concentrated in the east.
"We need to develop a fair amount of Trinidad's reserves first, but we believe there is an opportunity there," Mr. Look Kin said when asked about the issue, adding that he and other Government officials have talked with their counterparts in Caracas about the matter. "There is recognition on both sides that because of pure geography, Trinidad would seem to be the appropriate place to process some Venezuelan gas."
The high regard in which Trinidad is held by foreign investors contrasts sharply with the image it had two decades ago, when the local oil boom was at its peak and profligate spending was the order of the day. This time around, chastened Government officials say they are determined to maintain fiscal discipline and funnel the country's riches into much-needed infrastructure projects.
"We know it's rare to get a second chance, and we are trying very hard not to make the same mistakes as in the past," Vishnu Ramlogan, president of the Government's economic promotion agency, the Tourism and Industrial Development Company of Trinidad and Tobago, said. "We're not going to let inflation and conspicuous consumption run away and overheat the economy. This time there is a consensus our new-found wealth must be prudently managed."

HEADLINE: In Something Like a Debate, Kohl Defends While a Relaxed Schroder Taunts Him

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Sept. 3

 BODY:
In the closest thing to a televised presidential debate before elections this month, Chancellor Helmut Kohl gave a rambling defense today of his role as a statesman and the architect of German reunification.
Looking avuncular and almost unaware that he is in danger of losing his bid for re-election in just a few weeks, Mr. Kohl, 68, squared off in Parliament against the man who now leads him in popularity polls: Gerhard Schroder, 54, the Social Democratic Party's candidate. 
 Mr. Schroder, appearing confident and relaxed in his speech, accused Mr. Kohl of having fallen completely out of touch with the needs of the country and the demands of the job.
"The job of a chancellor is to bring the country together," Mr. Schroder taunted. "There was a time you understood that. But in the meantime you seem to have totally forgotten it."
The face-off had been built up in German media as a climactic rhetorical duel, the only direct confrontation between Mr. Kohl and Mr. Schroder before the elections on Sept. 27. It was not a debate, but rather a pair of speeches.
Under the rules today, the two candidates merely delivered rival statements to Parliament on the ostensible issue of debating the latest government budget. There was little opportunity for spontaneous repartee, clever riposts or other displays of quick thinking.
Mr. Kohl, who has been Chancellor for 16 years, is in the toughest fight of his career. With nationwide unemployment at 10.7 percent -- and nearly twice that high in the formerly Communist eastern half of the country -- Mr. Kohl is lagging behind Mr. Schroder in most polls by three to six percentage points.
Mr. Kohl has adamantly refused Mr. Schroder's demands to take part in any sort of American-style debate on prime-time television, probably because the Chancellor cannot begin to compete with his challenger in performing before the cameras.
Mr. Kohl often exudes a homey warmth and an endearing lack of pretentiousness, but he is also an obese man who wanders into long reminiscences and speaks indistinctly.
Mr. Schroder, by contrast, has mastered the art of being at ease before cameras and projecting a wide range of emotions from humor to righteous passion.
In his speech today, Mr. Kohl talked for nearly an hour about his historical accomplishments as a statesman. He dwelt proudly on his role in uniting East and West Germany, blasting Mr. Schroder and the Social Democrats for fretting about the costs. He talked at length about his role in creating a single European currency, though that is a change that most Germans are skeptical about.
Mr. Schroder, wearing a charcoal-colored suit and striped silk tie, hammered away at the idea that Mr. Kohl has been in power too long and allowed Germany to sink into record levels of unemployment while raising taxes ever higher.
Mr. Schroder also taunted the Chancellor about not entering a true debate. "I read all the time I can't be pinned down," he said, alluding to criticisms that he has not given enough detail about his positions on issues. "Well, come on then, pin me down."
Today's performances reinforced the sense that the election campaign is less about deep policy differences than it is about images and personalities. Mr. Kohl is campaigning on the image of stability and security, as well as his status as Europe's most influential leader. His campaign slogan is "World Class for Germany."
Mr. Schroder is campaigning on the promise of dynamism and personal abilities. A pragmatist who has tried to blur his party's Socialist traditions, he is running on an ambiguous idea of forging a "new middle" that defends Germany's generous social programs while promoting a vaguely pro-business agenda.
Both candidates today pledged their allegiance to roughly similar concepts for broad tax reform as well as to a continuation of Germany's social-market economy. Both endorsed continued heavy financial support for eastern Germany, mired in depression and unemployment.
Mr. Kohl accused Mr. Schroder and the Social Democrats of being ambivalent supporters of reunifying with East Germany, a charge that Mr. Schroder denied. Mr. Kohl also accused the Social Democrats of blocking tax reform for the last several years, only to support their own plan now.
"It's like one of Pavlov's experiments with dogs," Mr. Kohl said. "You just look at me, and you're already against it."
Mr. Schroder focused on the argument that Mr. Kohl has fallen completely out of touch. "At the beginning of our campaign, we Social Democrats said 'Thank you Helmut, but enough is enough,' " he said. But now, he continued, "your people don't even say thank you."

HEADLINE: State Trying to Coax 2 Exchanges From New York

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, Sept. 3

 BODY:
State officials are involved in talks intended to woo the nation's second- and third-largest stock exchanges out of New York City and into a new home in New Jersey, an economic development official said today.
The official, Lisa Kruse, who is the vice president for marketing and development for the New Jersey Commerce and Economic Growth Commission, confirmed unattributed reports in The Star-Ledger of Newark today that the state was talking to the computerized Nasdaq Exchange and the American Stock Exchange about a possible move to New Jersey. She would not disclose the locations involved, but the published reports said that Jersey City and Hoboken had been mentioned as possibilities. 
 Spokesmen for both exchanges, which are working out the final details of the merger that their members approved three months ago, would not comment on whether they were involved in any talks.
The 27-year-old Nasdaq has 3,100 employees in New York City, Washington and its suburbs and Trumbull, Conn.
The 77-year-old American Stock Exchange, which has 600 employees and 1,500 traders, is spread over three lower Manhattan locations.
Walter M. Smith Jr., executive vice president of Hartz Mountain Industries, a developer of office space along the Hudson River and elsewhere in the state, said he had no knowledge of such talks, but he added that he was not surprised at the reports. All the exchanges have expressed a need for new and larger sites, and now New Jersey seems to have an edge over New York when it comes to the cost and availability of office space, he said.
"Ten years ago the savings of New Jersey over New York were substantial, and it appears that we may be approaching that kind of era again," Mr. Smith said. "Every businessman, it seems to me, has to periodically address the cost of doing business."
The news of the talks comes on the heels of reports in May that New Jersey was trying to interest the New York Stock Exchange in moving. Over the years, New Jersey has been a perennial option, but it has lost out more than it has won; in many cases it appears that companies used the threat of moving to New Jersey to wring more incentives out of New York officials.

Big Board Votes to Abandon Mandatory Job-Bias Arbitration

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
The board of the New York Stock Exchange voted yesterday to no longer require industry arbitration of job-discrimination claims, deciding that it will hear such claims only when they are submitted and after a dispute has arisen, according to executives at the exchange.
The decision, which affects the whole brokerage industry as it covers stockbrokers and other members of the exchange, will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next few days, and after a period for public comment, it is expected to lead to a change in the exchange's rules, said James E. Buck, senior vice president and corporate secretary of the exchange. 
 The brokerage industry's practice of mandatorily referring employment disputes to industry arbitration -- as many brokerage employees agree to do when they sign their work contracts -- has gradually been eroded. Critics of mandatory arbitration have maintained that it gives unfair advantage to brokerage firms, and denies employees their civil rights by preventing them from getting access to courts. The proponents of mandatory arbitration say it is quicker, cheaper and more efficient than resorting to the courts.
The change by the Big Board follows Federal court decisions in Massachusetts and California, which held that brokerage firm employees could take discrimination claims to court and did not have to submit to industry arbitration. It also follows a recent decision by the National Association of Securities Dealers, which oversees the Nasdaq market. That body recently ruled that the matter of mandatory arbitration in these cases was one for individual securities firms to decide for themselves.
George Nicolau, a past president of the National Academy of Arbitrators and now a spokesmen on such issues, called the decision "a progressive step toward fairness."

Latin America Tells I.M.F. That Economies Are Sound
Officials from nine Latin American nations, who are in Washington for a two-day meeting with the International Monetary Fund, said their economies were basically sound and should not be penalized by investors because of the financial turmoil in Asia and Russia. 
 Latin America markets did not heed the comments, however. They fell sharply one day after Colombia devalued its currency. Moody's Investors Service also downgraded its rating of Brazil's foreign currency debt yesterday, sending Brazil's main stock market index down 8.6 percent. Page A9.
 
Russia's Crisis Is Deepening
As the crisis in Russia seems to be worsening and the ruble continues to decline, many of that country's food markets and hard-goods stores are running out of supplies. A4.
 
Russian Woes Cut Lehman Profits
Lehman Brothers became the latest brokerage firm to say that the financial turmoil in Russia and other developing countries would reduce its net income. Lehman had expected net income for the quarter to be about $211, but now estimates that it will be $151 million. C4.
 
Plea for an End to Northwest Strike
The Governor of Minnesota, Arne Carlson, called on President Clinton to order the pilots of Northwest Airlines back to work, but the White House reiterated its belief that the two sides should return to the bargaining table. The move by the Minnesota Governor, which follows the same request from other governors, came on the sixth day of the strike and a day after Northwest laid off more than half its 51,000 workers.

Retail Sales Increase 3.5%
American retailers reported sales in stores open at least a year rose 3.5 percent in August, but analysts warned that continued unease about the economy could slow retail sales for the rest of the year. C4.

Microsoft Ordered to Provide Files
A Federal judge ordered Microsoft to give the Justice Department reams of new evidence that Government lawyers say will bolster their antitrust case. Microsoft's lawyers had argued that the evidence should not be a part of the case because it was not specifically mentioned in the original lawsuits. C4.

Shell and Texaco in European Match
Royal Dutch/Shell and Texaco plan to combine their refining and marketing businesses in Europe, a step that could further speed a trend toward cutting costs and capacity as the oil industry struggles with declining profit. C2.

HEADLINE: CLINTON IN ULSTER;
Excerpts From Clinton's Remarks: 'We Are Through With Hate'

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Clinton's address yesterday to the people of Armagh, Northern Ireland, as transcribed by Federal Document Clearing House, a private transcription company:
I am especially proud to be here with my wife at this important time. Yesterday, she spoke to the Vital Voices conference, hundreds of women from Northern Ireland, working across all the lines that divide you for a better future. 
 Tonight, we are proud to be in a place that is a spiritual home to Irish people of both religious traditions and to millions of Irish-Americans as well.
Armagh is a city on a hill in every sense. Your faith and tolerance are making a new era of peace possible.
For yourselves and all the world, in every act of genuine reconciliation, you renew confidence that decency can triumph over hatred. You have inspired the rest of us to aim a little higher. I thank you and America thanks you for the precious gift you give us all -- a gift of hope redeemed and faith restored. . . .
Here, a Briton, St. Patrick, devoted himself to the cause of Ireland and left a legacy of faith and compassion. Here the Book of Armagh preserved his gentle message and the power of the Gospels.
Today the two cathedrals that dominate the landscape stand for the idea that communion is better than destructive competition. Two proud traditions can exist side by side, bringing people closer to God and closer to each other.
I salute the leadership of Dr. Sean Brady and Dr. Robert Eames, the Archbishops of the Catholic and the Church of Ireland diocese, respectively. For years they have walked together when it counted.
I salute the Presbyterians and the Methodists who have worked hard for peace, indeed the men and women of all denominations.
Here there have been difficulties, as elsewhere, but the historic streets of this old town remind us of a fundamental fact about your community: Armagh literally encircles its many traditions in a single community.
That is what Northern Ireland must do if you want the future of peace and prosperity that belongs to the children in this crowd tonight.
As you look ahead, to be sure, in this peace process, there will be false steps and disappointments. The question is not if the peace will be challenged. You know it will. The question is how will you respond when it is challenged. . . .
The Prime Minister and Mrs. Blair and Hillary and I just came from Omagh. We met with the families whose innocent were slaughtered. We met with those who were terribly wounded. We saw children scarred, some of them for life, because of the madness -- that if someone could just set off a big enough bomb; and kill enough Protestants and Catholics; kill enough men, women and children, including two pregnant women; kill enough people from Northern Ireland, Ireland and foreign countries -- that maybe everybody would walk away from peace. But it backfired.
Out of the unimaginably horrible agony of Omagh, the people said it is high time somebody told these people that we are through with hate, through with war, through with destruction. It will not work anymore. . . .
We wanted to come here in person to thank you -- to thank you for the peace, to thank you for strengthening the hand of everyone, everyone anywhere who is working to make the world a little better.
When I go now to other troubled places, I point to you as proof that peace is not an idle daydream, for your peace is real and it resonates around the world.
It echoes in the ears of people hungry for the end of strife in their own country.
Now when I meet Palestinians and Israelis, I can say: Don't tell me impossible; look at Northern Ireland.
When I meet Albanians and Serbs in Kosovo, I can say: Don't tell me it's impossible; look at Northern Ireland.
When I hear what the Indians and Pakistanis say about each other over their religious differences, I say: Don't tell me you can't work this out; look at Northern Ireland.
Centuries were put to bed and a new day has dawned.
Thank you for that gift to the world.
And never underestimate the impact you can have on the world. The great English poet and clergyman John Donne wrote those famous lines: "No man is an island. We are all a piece of the continent, a part of the main."
Tonight, we might even say in this interconnected world not even an island, not even a very unique island -- not even Ireland -- is fully an island.
On this island, Northern Ireland, obviously, is connected in ways to the republic as well as to England, Scotland and Wales. And in ways, the Republic of Ireland is connected to them also.
All of you on this island increasingly are connected to Europe and to the rest of the world as ideas and information and people fly across the globe at record speeds.
We are tied ever closer together. And we have obligations now that we not -- that we cannot shirk: to stand for the cause of human dignity everywhere.
To continue John Donne's beautiful metaphor -- when the bells of Armagh toll, they ring out not just to the Irish or Protestant and Catholic traditions. They ring out to people everywhere in the world who long for peace and freedom and dignity. That is your gift.
We Americans will do what we can to support the peace, to support economic projects, to support education projects. . . .
Three years ago, I pledged that if you chose peace, America would walk with you. You made the choice, and America will honor its pledge.

HEADLINE: THE CHALLENGER: A special report.;
A German Socialist Veers Toward the Center

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: BONN

 BODY:
Gerhard Schroder has changed with the times.
He first made his name in German politics in the 1970's as leader of the Jusos, the radical, stridently anti-American, anti-nuclear youth group of the Social Democratic Party. In 1981, in his maiden speech in Parliament, he became the first man ever to speak there without wearing a necktie. Late one beer-fueled night, according to an often-told story, he stopped by to rattle the gates of the Chancellery, and to shout, "I want in there!" 
 But the higher he rose and the older he got, the less rambunctious he became. He grew to admire the United States, he says. As premier of Germany's second largest and third most populous state for the last eight years, he as been the consummate pragmatist, cooperating with or disregarding the left-wing party hierarchy according to his purposes. He not only started wearing neckties, he took to smoking fine Havana cigars and sporting clothes designed by Armani.
He got so chummy with business executives that trade unionists and other ideological stalwarts in his party started mocking him as "der Genosse von Bossen" -- the comrade of the bosses.
Now the Social Democrats, who have failed three times to oust Chancellor Helmut Kohl, have turned to Gerhard Schroder to do the job in a national election on Sept. 27. Handsome, telegenic, a ferocious worker, Mr. Schroder, 54, is almost a generation younger than Mr. Kohl, who is 68. Not by accident, he is running a media-savvy campaign as ambiguous and devoid of specifics as those that brought Tony Blair and Bill Clinton to power in Britain and the United States.
Mr. Schroder must grapple with the problem that has confronted left-wing politicians throughout Europe as well as the Democrats in the United States: big government has become too costly.
Partly because of the huge expenditures in eastern Germany after reunification, partly because of the competition with countries that have learned to live with less, Germany can no longer afford the restrictive labor laws, ample pensions and generous health care system with which Mr. Schroder's party has been identified. "There is no more West German island," said a Western diplomat here. "Germany has to live by the same rules as the rest of us, which means cutting back. That's the real dilemma for Schroder and his party."
A victory would make Mr. Schroder one of Europe's most powerful men, standing at the helm of the continent's dominant economic and political power. It would also constitute an unprecedented accomplishment in modern German history; no sitting Chancellor has been defeated by a candidate of another party since the federal republic was established in 1949.
The polls put him ahead, but only by a slender margin, with a sizable undecided vote. Germany is accustomed to a more carnivorous, less image-oriented politics, with plenty of ideological meat to chew on, and people are starting to grumble.
"You can't quite get hold of him," said Josef Joffe, editorial page editor of the Suddeutsche Zeitung of Munich, one of the country's major newspapers. "He was given the nod very grudgingly by the party bosses, who stand well to his left, because they were convinced he was the only one with a chance to win. So he tries to placate the left wing of his party and to win over the swing voters at the same time."
"He obfuscates, prevaricates and says as little as possible."
Michael Naumann, the German-born New York publisher whom Mr. Schroder has recruited as a potential culture minister, takes a different view. He sees Mr. Schroder as a man who has the capacity to answer a national craving, "to fill this big psychological hole at the center of German life, the need to define what we live for in the midst of our amazing material well-being."
Above all, he has a fresh face. Mr. Kohl has been Chancellor for 16 years, as long as Franklin D. Roosevelt would have served as President had he not died in office. Mr. Schroder has apparently concluded that the electorate is tired of Mr. Kohl but resistant to a major deviation from his policies. So he talks, in pure Clintonese, of "a New Middle."

Recognizing Limits To Welfare State
In mid-August, on the day before he announced his party's election program, Mr. Schroder sat down for an interview at the party's striking steel-and-glass headquarters, Willy Brandt Haus, in the heart of the new Berlin.
"The welfare state has reached its limits," he said, sitting at a table covered with the detritus typical of campaigns everywhere -- half-eaten sandwiches and empty coffee cups. "We won't be able to increase payments."
You could almost hear the echo of Bill Clinton's voice proclaiming the era of big government over.
But like generations of liberal politicians eager to sound a note of fiscal responsibility, Mr. Schroder insisted that by closing "a labyrinth of tax loopholes," he could roll back the small welfare cuts made by Mr. Kohl and still cut income taxes. "It's not that much of a riddle," he said.
An engaging man with a large head, a boldly cut jaw and the beefy body of a former linebacker, Mr. Schroder spoke quietly but gestured vigorously with his squarish hands, waving a pair of half-moon spectacles as he talked. His eyes are his most notable feature -- ice blue under fair, bushy brows and unwelcoming until he laughs, which he does often, in private as well as on the stump.
"I've had to give up the old Hegelian idea that when theory and reality clash, reality is wrong," he said, apropos of his move to the middle. "Reality is often right."
Asked whether he feared that Mr. Kohl would try to discredit him by talking about the radicalism of his youth, Mr. Schroder responded, "I don't think so. As you see, the revolution I planned didn't take place, so there's no point in bringing up what I said then."
He added, in a paraphrase of what he said at Georgetown University earlier this year: "Learning is the essence of politics. You should never trust politicians who think they have nothing left to learn any more."
But Mr. Schroder predicted that his opponents might try to discredit him by talking about his private life, although Germans, he said, were less interested in scandal and gossip "than you Americans or even the British."
Mr. Schroder has been married four times. The first marriage lasted 3 years, the second 9 and the third 12, breaking up bitterly two years ago. When he eloped with Doris Kopf, a journalist from Bavaria, the spurned third wife, Hiltrud Hamel, called him "a coward, an opportunist and an egotist."
Although the Christian Democratic leaders have refrained so far from personal criticism, the party's youth group has produced a brochure that tackles the marriage issue. "Schroder is a bad choice," it says. "Three women couldn't be wrong."
In another indirect assault, the owner of a big German car-rental company called Sixt is running a magazine advertisement that shows two pictures of Mr. Schroder, one looking left and the other looking right. "Sixt," the caption declares, "has cars for people who don't know where they want to go."
One of the biggest questions about Mr. Schroder's destination is who would help him get there. It appears highly unlikely that the Social Democrats will gain a clear majority, even if they win, so he would need a coalition partner. There are two possibilities -- an alliance with the Greens or teaming up with the Christian Democrats in the kind of grand coalition Germany had under Kurt Georg Kiesinger from 1966 to 1969.
When his visitor suggested that a coalition with the often erratic Greens would make more sense in the party context, because they are more ideologically compatible, but a grand coalition would make more sense in a governmental context because of greater stability Mr. Schroder agreed. Then he added, with a malicious little grin: "There's an old saying in this country: If you want to be successful, think first of your country, then of your party."
Whose old saying? he was asked.
"Mine," he answered.
But the decision will not be his alone. Parties matter more in German politics than in the United States, and Mr. Schroder does not yet control his party. Oskar Lafontaine, the party leader, is giving stout backing to Mr. Schroder for now, though he looked noticeably jumpy recently as Mr. Schroder announced the party program. Many people wonder what he will do once the ballots have been counted, and the Christian Democrats are trying to play on that, suggesting that it would be the party bosses rather than Mr. Schroder who would call the ideological tune in choosing a partner and framing Government policy.
 
Trying to Emulate Clinton and Blair
Mr. Schroder tries to equate himself to Mr. Clinton and Mr. Blair. But the parallel is inexact. Each of them took office having already won the main ideological arguments within his own party, and Mr. Schroder, if he wins, would become Chancellor with important questions still unresolved.
For example, Mr. Lafontaine, a harsh critic of "billionaire capitalists," wants to cut the top income tax rate from 53 percent to 49, while Mr. Schroder wants to bring it down to 45. Mr. Schroder sometimes emphasizes a "modern" Germany that shines in new technology, as when he named Jost Stillman, a businessman, as an economic adviser; other times he attacks the pension reform and labor flexibility that modernizers consider mandatory.
Nor is it clear, despite tens of thousands of words and endless columns of analysis in the newspapers, exactly what Mr. Schroder would do to attack unemployment, one of Germany's most serious and intractable problems.
The party platform says a Schroder Government would expect labor unions to permit "the more flexible organization of work." Business, it continues, needs to invest more, innovate more and provide more apprenticeships. The Government itself, it says, needs to shrink the bureaucracy and increase public spending on research.
It promises a "crash program" to fight joblessness among the young by bringing 100,000 unemployed young people into training programs.
But the nuts and bolts of the program are still missing. Persuading labor and business to work together, devising practical programs and finding the money to pay for them would be the job of Walter Riester, the highly regarded 54-year-old deputy chairman of the powerful metalworkers' union, who has been designated as the labor-minister-to-be in a Schroder Government.
One thing seems plain: with Mr. Schroder as Chancellor, Germany will remain a firm ally of the United States. Diplomats from both countries seem sure of this, as do officials Mr. Schroder met during his recent trip to Washington.
Sometimes he stretches a point to dramatize his conversion from anti-American views. He tells people that "my daughter was born in New York," when in fact she is his stepdaughter by his fourth marriage, and until 1997, he had not visited the United States in more than 15 years.
But there is no doubt that Mr. Schroder admires Mr. Clinton's political style, especially his success in repositioning himself and his party. Mr. Schroder has embraced issues like crime that the Christian Democrats long dominated. He has even hired Hank Sheinkopf, a Clinton adviser in 1996, to help with instant rebuttal and research on the opposition.
In the conversation at the party headquarters, Mr. Schroder said that despite an all-party agreement that Germany will not commit military forces abroad except on a United Nations mandate, he could not conceive of Germany holding back from intervening in the embattled Serbian province of Kosovo if the United Nations was silent and other European nations wanted to act. That would please the United States, which has long felt that the Europeans have been too slow to police their own turf.
In a long career, Mr. Schroder, who is known as Gerd, has managed to find a way forward when others might well have felt stymied.
He had no more promising a start in life than Bill Clinton. His father, a conscript, was killed during the retreat from Russia when Mr. Schroder was only three days old, and his mother raised him alone while working as a cleaning woman. He dropped out of school at 14, went to night school and ended up studying law at Gottingen University during the turbulence of 1968.
These days, Mr. Schroder handles hecklers, commonplace in German politics, with great aplomb. Asked how he learned, he replied, "By heckling."
 
Climbing the Rungs Of the Political Ladder
After a stint as an member of Parliament in Bonn, he won his party's nomination for premier in the state of Lower Saxony in 1984. He lost that time, but won four years later. Last March, he gained a third term in a landslide, a victory that clinched his nomination for Chancellor.
Except for the good suits and expensive cigars, Mr. Schroder lives unpretentiously in a smallish apartment in Hanover, the state capital. He has no vast entourage, disdaining all but the most basic security protection.
Lower Saxony, covering most of the northwestern corner of the country, is perhaps best known outside Germany for the fact that Hanover's ruling family acceded to the British throne in the person of George I in 1714. The state includes Hamlen, where the Pied Piper played, and Wolfsburg, headquarters of Volkswagen.
A seat on the Volkswagen board goes with the premier's job because the state government is the company's largest shareholder. And that, by all accounts, has had a major impact on Mr. Schroder's life. In a number of ways, he modeled himself on the company's wily chairman, Ferdinand Piech.
For centuries, Hanover has held annual trade fairs, and Mr. Schroder became a regular at them, courting businessmen, inviting them to dinner at a favorite Italian restaurant or to a game of tennis.
But he always kept his fences mended with younger, more proletarian groups as well. Dr. Ludolf von Wertenberg, the head of the Federation of German Industries, who was a Christian Democratic member of Parliament when Mr. Schroder was in Bonn, recalled that Mr. Schroder always asked beforehand who would be in the audience when he was invited to make a speech.
 
Keeping a Close Eye On the Audience
 "Students? He'd show up in a turtleneck," Dr. von Wertenberg said in an interview in his Cologne office. "Entrepreneurs? The whitest shirt you ever saw. He's amazingly good on his feet, never uses texts or notes if he can avoid it, and if he sensed that what he was saying wasn't going over well, he'd change gears within seconds. Nice guy, provacateur, it didn't matter, as long as he wasn't ignored."
He bulled his way to the nomination for Chancellor, taking his case over the heads of the party leaders to the rank-and-file.
"Schroder's will for power is certainly impressive," the former party chairman, Hans-Jochen Vogel, wrote in his memoirs. "But the question increasingly is, What does he want to do with that power?"
But the leaders gave him his shot at the Chancellorship anyway, and he opened his campaign two weeks ago with three rallies in a single day, in Berlin, Munich and Bonn. Relaxed, at times almost professorial in his interviews and news conferences, he let it rip on the stump. His voice hoarse from shouting, his face almost as red as his power necktie, Mr. Schroder greeted the crowds with both arms aloft in a V-for-Victory sign like Richard M. Nixon's.
At Rheinaue Park in Bonn, along the riverfront, there were bratwurst stands and beer vendors, hot-air balloons and rock musicians. Some in the audience wore football jerseys marked "Schroder 10" -- a reference to the candidate's habit of giving people a flyer listing nine reasons to vote for the Social Democrats and telling them, "The 10th is Helmut Kohl."
There was also a lot of talk, from Mr. Schroder and other party figures about building an economy that was both humane and efficient, some complaints about the lot of the lowest-paid people in German society and the inevitable vague allusion to a new alliance linking labor, management and government.
But there was not a single mention of socialism.
Occasionally, Mr. Schroder got into some tried-and-true Social Democratic grooves, lambasting the Government, for example, for allowing disabled workers to collect only 80 per cent of their wages when sick. This, he said, "is not social justice; they can't go to the store and pay 80 per cent of the price of a loaf of bread or get their landlord to give them a 20 percent discount."
That went over well enough with the crowd of 8,000 to 10,000, although they had been soaked by rains. But what they had on their minds most of all, it seemed, was what Mr. Schroder is concentrating on: winning.
Their loudest cheers came when he told them: "We want to win -- we will win -- because we want to do -- we will do -- something for the German people."

F.E.C. Audit Prompts Reno To Review '96 Campaign
Attorney General Janet Reno has seized on a Federal Election Commission audit to reopen the Justice Department's review of whether an independent prosecutor should examine the issue of spending by the 1996 Clinton-Gore campaign. A summary of the findings of F.E.C. field auditors strongly questions the legality of a multimillion advertising campaign underwritten by the Democratic National Committee in 1996 that indirectly helped the Clinton-Gore campaign, Government officials said. If Ms. Reno decides to proceed with an outside inquiry after a 90-day preliminary review, President Clinton could be a pivotal subject because he was deeply involved in the ad campaign. A1

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Senator Lieberman's Talk on President's Personal Conduct

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 3

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a speech about the Clinton-Lewinsky episode that was delivered on the Senate floor today by Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, as recorded by the Federal Document Clearing House, a private transcription service:
To begin with, I must respectfully disagree with the President's contention that his relationship with Monica Lewinsky and the way in which he misled us about it is nobody's business but his family's and that even Presidents have private lives, as he said. 
 Whether he or we think it fair or not, the reality is in 1998 that a President's private life is public. Contemporary news media standards will have it no other way. And surely this President was given fair notice of that by the amount of time the news media has dedicated to investigating his personal life during the 1992 campaign and in the years since.
But there is more to this than modern media intrusiveness. The President is not just the elected leader of our country. He is, as Presidential scholar Clinton Rossiter observed, and I quote, "the one-man distillation of the American people" and, as President Taft said at another time, the personal embodiment and representative of their dignity and majesty.
So when his personal conduct is embarrassing, it is sadly so not just for him and his family, it is embarrassing for all of us as Americans.
The President is a role model and, because of his prominence and the moral authority that emanates from his office, sets standards of behavior for the people he serves. . . .
So no matter how much the President or others may wish to compartmentalize the different spheres of his life, the inescapable truth is that the President's private conduct can and often does have profound public consequences.
In this case, the President apparently had extramarital relations with an employee half his age and did so in the workplace, in the vicinity of the Oval Office. Such behavior is not just inappropriate, it is immoral. And it is harmful, for it sends a message of what is acceptable behavior to the larger American family -- particularly to our children -- which is as influential as the negative messages communicated by the entertainment culture.
If you doubt that, just ask America's parents about the intimate and frequently unseemly sexual questions their young children have been asking them and discussing since the President's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky became public seven months ago. I have had many of those conversations with parents, particularly in Connecticut, and from them I conclude that parents across our country feel much as I do that something very sad and sordid has happened in American life when I cannot watch the news on television with my 10-year-old daughter anymore.
This, unfortunately, is all-too-familiar territory for America's families in today's anything-goes culture, where sexual promiscuity is too often treated as just another life-style choice with little risk of adverse consequences.
It is this mind-set that has helped to threaten the stability and integrity of the family, which continues to be the most important unit of civilized society, the place where we raise our children and teach them to be responsible citizens, to develop and nurture their personal and moral faculties.
President Clinton, in fact, has shown during the course of his Presidency that he understands this and the broad concern in the public about the threat to the family. He has used the bully pulpit of his Presidency to eloquently and effectively call for the renewal of our common values, particularly the principle of personal responsibility and our common commitment to family. And he has spoken out admirably against sexual promiscuity among teen-agers in clear terms of right and wrong, emphasizing the consequences involved.
Now, all of that makes the President's misconduct so confusing and so damaging. The President's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky not only contradicted the values he has publicly embraced over the last six years, it has, I fear, compromised his moral authority at a time when Americans of every political persuasion agree that the decline of the family is one of the most pressing problems we are facing.
Nevertheless, I believe the President could have lessened the harm his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky has caused if he had acknowledged his mistake and spoken with candor about it to the American people shortly after it became public in January.
But, as we now know, he chose not to do this. This deception is particularly troubling because it was not just a reflexive and in many ways understandable human act of concealment to protect himself and his family from what he called the embarrassment of his own conduct when he was confronted with it in the deposition in the Jones case. But rather, it was the intentional and premeditated decision to do so.
In choosing this path, I fear that the President has undercut the efforts of millions of American parents who are naturally trying to instill in our children the value of honesty. As most any mother and father knows, kids have a singular ability to detect double standards. So we can safely assume that it will be that much more difficult to convince our sons and daughters of the importance of telling the truth when the most powerful man in the nation evades it. Many parents I have spoken with in Connecticut confirm this unfortunate consequence.
The President's intentional and consistent statements, more deeply, may also undercut the trust that the American people have in his word. Under the Constitution, as Presidential scholar Neustadt has noted, the President's ultimate source of authority, particularly his moral authority, is the power to persuade, to mobilize public opinion, to build consensus behind a common agenda. And at this, the President has been extraordinarily effective.
But that power hinges on the President's support among the American people and their faith and confidence in his motivations and agenda, yes, but also in his word.
As Teddy Roosevelt once explained, "My power vanishes into thin air the instant that my fellow citizens, who are straight and honest, cease to believe that I represent them and fight for what is straight and honest."
"That is all the strength that I have," Roosevelt said.
Sadly, with his deception, President Clinton may have weakened the great power and strength that he possesses, of which President Roosevelt spoke.
I know this is a concern that many of my colleagues share, which is to say that the President has hurt his credibility and therefore perhaps his chances of moving his policy agenda forward.
But I believe that the harm the President's actions have caused extends beyond the political arena. I am afraid that the misconduct the President has admitted may be reinforcing one of the worst messages being delivered by our popular culture, which is that values are fungible. And I am concerned that his misconduct may help to blur some of the most important bright lines of right and wrong in our society.
Mr. President, I said at the outset that this was a very difficult statement to write and deliver. That is true, very true. And it is true in large part because it is so personal and yet needs to be public, but also because of my fear that it will appear unnecessarily judgmental. I truly regret this.
I know from the Bible that only God can judge people. The most that we can do is to comment without condemning individuals. And in this case I have tried to comment on the consequences of the President's conduct on our country.
I know that the President is far from alone in the wrongdoing he has admitted. We as humans are all imperfect. We are all sinners. Many have betrayed a loved one, and most have told lies. Members of Congress have certainly been guilty of such behavior, as have some previous Presidents.
We try to understand. We must try to understand the complexity and difficulty of personal relationships, which should give us pause before passing judgment on them. We all fall short of the standards our best values set for us. Certainly I do.
But the President, by virtue of the office he sought and was elected to, has traditionally been held to a higher standard. This is as it should be, because the American President, as I quoted earlier, is not just the one-man distillation of the American people but today the most powerful person in the world. And as such, the consequences of his misbehavior, even private misbehavior, are much greater than that of an average citizen, a C.E.O. or even a senator. . . .
Just as the American people are demanding of their leaders, though, they are also fundamentally fair and forgiving, which is why I was so hopeful the President could begin to repair the damage done with his address to the nation on the 17th. But like so many others, I came away feeling that for reasons that are thoroughly human, he missed a great opportunity that night. He failed to clearly articulate to the American people that he recognized how significant and consequential his wrongdoing was and how badly he felt about it.
He failed to show, I think, that he understood his behavior had diminished the office he holds and the country he serves and that it is inconsistent with the mainstream American values that he has advanced as President. And I regret that he failed to acknowledge that while Mr. Starr and Ms. Lewinsky, Mrs. Tripp and the news media have each in their own way contributed to the crisis we now face, his Presidency would not be imperiled if it had not been for the behavior he himself described as wrong and inappropriate. Because the conduct the President admitted to that night was serious, and his assumption of responsibility inadequate.
The last three weeks have been dominated by a cacophony of media and political voices calling for impeachment or resignation or censure, while a lesser chorus implores us to move on and get this matter behind us.
Appealing as that latter option may be to many people who are understandably weary of this crisis, the transgressions the President has admitted to are too consequential for us to walk away and leave the impression for our children today and for our posterity tomorrow that what he acknowledges he did within the White House is acceptable behavior for our nation's leader. On the contrary, as I have said, it is wrong and unacceptable, and should be followed by some measure of public rebuke and accountability.
We in Congress, elected representatives of all the American people, are surely capable institutionally of expressing such disapproval through a resolution of reprimand or censure of the President for his misconduct. But it is premature to do so, as my colleagues of both parties seem to agree, until we have received the report of the independent counsel and the White House's response to it.
In the same way, it seems to me that talk of impeachment and resignation at this time is unjust and unwise.
It is unjust because we do not know enough, in fact -- and will not until the independent counsel reports and the White House responds -- to conclude whether we have crossed the high threshold our Constitution rightly sets for overturning the results of a popular election in our democracy and bringing on the national trauma of removing an incumbent President from office. For now, in fact, all we know for certain is what the President acknowledged on Aug. 17. As far as I can see, the rest is rumor, speculation or hearsay -- much less then is required by members of the House and Senate in the dispatch of the solemn responsibilities that the Constitution gives us in such circumstances.
And I believe that talk of impeachment and resignation now is unwise because it ignores the reality that while the independent counsel proceeds with his investigation, the President is still our nation's leader, our Commander in Chief. Economic uncertainty and other problems here at home, as well as the fiscal and political crises in Russia and Asia and the growing threats posed by Iraq, North Korea and worldwide terrorism, all demand the President's focused leadership. For that reason, while the legal process moves forward, I believe it is important that we provide the President with the time and space and support he needs to carry out his most important duties and protect our national interest and security.
That time and space may also give the President additional opportunities to accept personal responsibility, to rebuild public trust in his leadership, to really commit himself to the values of opportunity, responsibility and community that brought him to office, and to act to heal the wounds in our national character.
In the meantime, as the debate on this matter proceeds and as the investigation goes forward, we would be advised, I would respectfully suggest, to heed the wisdom of Abraham Lincoln's second annual address to Congress, in 1862. With the nation at war with itself, President Lincoln warned, and I quote: "If there ever could be a time for mere catch arguments, that time is surely not now. In times like the present, men should utter nothing for which they would not willingly be responsible through time and eternity."
I believe that we are at such a time again today. There's so much at stake, we too must resist the impulse toward catch arguments and reflex reactions. Let us proceed in accordance with our nation's traditional moral compass, yes, but in a manner that is fair and at a pace that is deliberate and responsible.
Let us as a nation honestly confront the damage that the President's actions over the last seven months have caused, but not to the exclusion of the good that his leadership has done over the past six years, nor at the expense of our common interest as Americans.
And let us be guided by the conscience of the Constitution, which calls on us to place the common good above any partisan or personal interest, as we now in our time work together to resolve this serious challenge to our democracy.

Japan Considers Nationalizing Some Banks

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 3

 BODY:
Japan is considering a trial step toward nationalizing troubled big banks.
The idea, one that might seem more at home in the old Communist bloc than in the world's second-largest capitalist economy, would be an odd and embarrassing step for Japan's Government to adopt. Yet taking over one or more giant banks could avoid the risk of a large-scale bankruptcy that would rattle the nation's financial system. And while there are doubters, some analysts say that nationalization may be the best way out of a difficult situation. 
 The test is likely to be played out with the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, which has been teetering as political parties here squabble over how to save it. Now there are signs that the parties may put their swords aside and work toward a solution, perhaps involving nationalization.
Thus, as Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa heads on Friday for talks with officials in the United States, he is leaving the financial system in less turmoil than it was a week ago. Though the benchmark Nikkei index of 225 stocks fell 115.38 points, or eight-tenths of a percent today, to 14,261.24, bank stocks in general rose more than 15 percent. Early Friday, the Nikkei was down a further 163.04 points, to 14,098.20 at midday. The yen eased to 134.26 to the dollar.
If Japan can restore financial stability, experts say, it can move toward repairing the broad economy -- something American officials have been prodding the Japanese, less and less politely, to do for years.
Confidence has been shaken by the near-collapse of the Long-Term Credit Bank, whose $180 billion in assets makes it one of the country's largest. The Government wants to inject taxpayers' money, so that the bank can be more readily absorbed in a rescue merger. But the opposition parties demand rigid criteria in exchange for the use of public funds.
The issue of what to do with the nation's biggest and weakest banks has become crucial, and it has helped drag down stock prices in recent weeks. But the idea of the Government's stepping in to nationalize banks has become increasingly accepted, and expected, by investors.
"Many small banks and many major banks can no longer fund themselves in the market because people are too scared," said Alicia Ogawa, a banking analyst with Salomon Smith Barney here. "The Government has to take over that function. But the public will not stand for the Government lending a ton of money unless the Government manages it. Otherwise, they run the risk of current management taking the money and flushing it down the toilet again."
The Government has already taken stakes in the largest banks, but the holdings are relatively tiny ones. Now, after dancing around the concept of nationalization, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the opposition parties are expected to address the issue. "Nationalization is one of the major pillars of our proposed bill," said Eisei Ito, who heads the policy research board of the Democratic Party, the largest opposition group. "We do not think that many banks will be nationalized, but we are organizing the bill to accommodate the situation, just in case several banks collapse."
Today, the opposition parties submitted their proposed bills for reviving the financial system to Parliament and will defend them in debate Friday. They have criticized the Government proposals, arguing that they cater to small and regional financial institutions but lack provisions for dealing with the largest and weakest banks.
Japanese officials listen to Americans for advice on tackling bad-debt problems, and they fashioned their plan from methods used in the United States to resolve the savings and loan crisis of the late 1980's and early 90's. But now, some Japanese say that perhaps the proper model is not the Resolution Trust Corporation and the small bridge banks, which Washington used to help close insolvent savings and loans, but a method used to deal with the collapse of Continental Illinois Bank in 1984.
Although no specific deals between the opposing sides have yet been struck, politicians are widely backing a proposal allowing the Long-Term Credit Bank to be the model for nationalizing a big bank. The bank would write off about $5.5 billion in unrecoverable loans, depleting its capital by more than 80 percent. The Government would then step in and buy newly issued shares to bring the capital back to its former level and then restructure the bank, selling what assets it could and trying to collect on the rest.
In the process, the Government would bring in new managers, who would either liquidate the bank or revive it and sell it to another bank.

HEADLINE: Minnesota Governor Asks Clinton to Halt Northwest Pilots' Strike

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
Abandoning his neutral stance in the pilots' strike against Northwest Airlines, Gov. Arne Carlson of Minnesota called on President Clinton yesterday to order the pilots back to work, but the White House stood firm against the idea.
Northwest took a tougher stand, too, sending a provocative signal to its unions by naming the head of its strike preparation efforts, Mickey P. Foret, as its new chief financial officer. Mr. Foret was president of Continental Airlines under Frank Lorenzo, whose battles with unions at Eastern Airlines and Continental, drove both into bankruptcy. 
 Mr. Foret replaces James A. Lawrence, who Northwest said would pursue other interests.
The moves came on the sixth day of the pilots' strike and a day after Northwest laid off more than half its 51,000 workers, many of whom live in Minnesota, saying it could not afford to keep paying them if it was not operating.
Several other Midwest governors have already called on the White House to intervene. But Mr. Carlson, a Republican in the state where Northwest has its headquarters and where there is wide sympathy for the pilots, had been reluctant to urge such action, a course that the pilots oppose and Northwest quietly favors.
"It was everyone's hope that the strike could be resolved without the President taking this action," the Governor said. "But now as we enter the sixth full day of this strike with no end in sight, I believe it is time for the President to act."
The White House said that the President appreciated the views of Mr. Carlson and other officials but that Mr. Clinton felt that the best way for the strike to be resolved was for the sides to return to the bargaining table.
Talks broke down last Friday night, hours before the strike deadline set by the pilots and have not resumed. The pilots want a 14 percent wage increase over three years to make up for pay cuts they took to help save the airline from bankruptcy in 1993. They also say they want increased job security. Northwest has offered 9 percent over four years, saying it cannot afford more.
The two sides have agreed to meet on Saturday in Chicago with a Federal mediator to determine whether full-fledged contract negotiations would be productive.
Northwest also said yesterday that it was suspending its advertising campaign critical of the pilots during the Labor Day weekend because of the meeting on Saturday. The two sides have been warring with each other in print and television advertising in Detroit, Minneapolis and other cities. The pilots previously said they had stopped their advertising.
On Wednesday, Rodney E. Slater, the Secretary of Transportation, ordered Mesaba Airlines and Express Airlines I, two Northwest-affiliated commuter carriers that have stopped flying as a result of the strike, to come up with a plan to resume service to 17 cities in 11 states by the end of today. Under a Federal program, Washington subsidizes flights to the cities because airlines say it would impossible to make money serving them.
But both of the carriers said yesterday that complying with the Secretary's order would threaten their viability and therefore their long-term service to the 17 cities.
It is not clear what step the Transportation Department will take next.
Under the Railway Labor Act, the President has the power to force the pilots back to work for 60 days while a special emergency board tries to come up with a solution acceptable to both sides if he believes that the strike is disrupting the economy.

HEADLINE: Police Are Criticized as Poughkeepsie House Yields Corpses

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER and JANE GROSS 

DATELINE: POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y., Sept. 3

 BODY:
A day after an unemployed school aide was arrested in the murder of one woman and was first suspected in the deaths of seven others, new questions arose today over how aggressively the police pursued complaints from at least two prostitutes who contended that they were assaulted by the suspect in the case.
The bodies of four of the women that the school aide, Kendall Francois, 27, is suspected of murdering over two years have been removed from his parents' house here near the campus of Vassar College. But officials said they knew that there still were more bodies to be removed. 
 Georgiana Johnson, hovering at the crime scene, said that her daughter, Debbie Annan, had twice told the police that she barely escaped alive from an encounter with Mr. Francois, who had picked her up on the corner of Academy and Montgomery Streets, took her to his home for paid sex and tried to strangle her.
Mrs. Johnson said that her daughter, then an addict and prostitute who occasionally helped police in undercover drug operations, had given detectives Mr. Francois's name and address as early as November.
"They totally ignored her," said Mrs. Johnson, one of many friends and relatives of the women thought to be victims in the case who stood outside 99 Fulton Avenue. Mrs. Johnson added that her daughter now lives in Ocala, Fla., clean of her crack cocaine addiction and working double shifts as a cashier at a convenience store.
A similar story was told by a second woman, a one-time prostitute who now lives in Dutchess County, outside Poughkeepsie, and was interviewed on tape by Irene Cornell of WCBS radio. The woman said that she told the police that Mr. Francois had tried to strangle her in November 1996, a month after the first disappearance in the case. She remembered that during the assault Mr. Francois suddenly stopped himself from choking her and said: "Oh my God, I almost did it again."
She, too, managed to escape and flagged down a squad car from the Town of Poughkeepsie.
Frank Lanza, afternoon producer for the radio station, declined to identify the woman, but said she told them that after the incident she was interviewed twice more by police, once shortly after the disappearance of the seventh woman missing in the case.
Lieut. William Siegrist, a spokesman for the task force investigating the case made up of detectives from both the City and Town of Poughkeepsie as well as the state police, would not comment on the specific complaints. But he defended the police's handling of the investigation.
"All the complaints that came to us were handled in a proper manner and we have done everything we can to solve this crime," he said.
He also denied that the police were lackadaisical because seven of the eight women missing and presumed dead were prostitutes. "I've tried to maintain that these women were human beings and should be treated with as much respect as any other person," he said.
Outside the ramshackle house where Mr. Francois lived, investigators in white jumpsuits and goggles continued their search for remains and Mrs. Johnson talked about her daughter's inability to get the attention of the police, saying, "They didn't even take a report."
But another parent of a possible victim offered a drastically different account of how the police had pursued the case.
Patricia Barone, whose daughter Gina disappeared on Dec. 9, 1996, said investigators followed every lead and interviewed every person she had suggested.
"They absolutely did their job," Mrs. Barone said. "They picked up on it the day I reported her missing, and took it from there."
Mrs. Barone, accompanied by two nieces, spoke with uncanny calm, even though her daughter, a drug addict since the age of 12, was expected to be among the decomposing bodies inside.
"In my head, I'd come to terms with it," Mrs. Barone said. "I had a feeling she was gone all this time. I always felt when the good Lord thought I was ready to hear it, I'd hear it."
The Dutchess County District Attorney, William V. Grady, declined to give details of the long investigation into the missing prostitutes, all of whom are now presumed dead and inside Mr. Francois's house. But the District Attorney said that many women had come forward with accounts of "rough sex" with Mr. Francois. All of their stories were taken seriously, the District Attorney said, regardless of their background or demeanor.
"But just because incidents took place doesn't mean arrests can happen," he said. "You need probable cause, sufficient evidence."
The police today wheeled out a fourth body on a stretcher from the green clapboard house in which Mr. Francois lived with his parents, McKinley and Paulette Francois, and a teen-age sister, Kirstyn. They also brought in a supply of rakes and shovels, presumably to dig up more remains or evidence.
Mr. Grady said investigators had "spotted" many other bodies that they had not yet reached because of the laborious process of gathering evidence in such squalid conditions.
Mr. Grady speculated that Mr. Francois's parents, who also lived there, had not smelled the corpses because this "is not your average home -- it stinks, it is garbage-ridden."
The District Attorney added that the "bodies were hidden" though he would neither confirm nor deny reports that some were in suitcases.
So far the only body publicly identified is that of Catina L. Newmaster, 25, who disappeared on Aug. 26. Two other bodies taken out of the house have been tentatively identified as well, but their next of kin have not been notified, according to Mr. Grady. Mr. Grady spoke before the fourth body had been taken out of the house.
Besides Ms. Newmaster, the vanished women are: Wendy Meyers, 30; Gina Barone, 29; Kathleen Hurley, 47; Catherine Marsh, 31; Michelle Eason, 27; Mary Healey Giaccone, 29, and Sandra Jean French, 51. Seven of the eight had been arrested for prostitution and most were said to have worked Poughkeepsie's Main Street to support their crack habits.
So far, Mr. Francois has been charged only in the strangling of Ms. Newmaster, but a county grand jury has begun looking into the case and could issue a broader indictment.
Neighbors of the Francois family told the police that they were not aware of the killings, though some longtime neighbors and a postman said they had noticed a stench emanating from the filthy house, whose overgrown shrubbery and neglected appearance make it stand out on a tree-lined block of tidy middle class houses.
Law enforcement authorities still refused to explain publicly why they finally seized Mr. Francois for questioning on Tuesday. But Manjit Singh, a worker at a Sunoco gas station near Mr. Francois's house said that on Tuesday morning a distraught woman with blond hair and clad in sweat pants ran into the station saying she had been attacked. A customer alerted police officers nearby who were handing out fliers with photographs of Ms. Newmaster. A law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the gas station incident provided a major break in the case.
The case has cast light on the two worlds that flanked Mr. Francois's house. One block away is the relatively rarefied world of the prestigious college and two blocks in the other direction is Main Street, a strip of fast food restaurants like McDonald's, Wendy's, Taco Bell and Dunkin' Donuts, where prostitutes eager for drugs sold fleeting sex for as little as $5 to men who drove by in cars.
Prostitutes along the Main Street Mall, a dilapidated commercial strip of pawnshops and wig stores, said today that they knew some of the victims and recognized photos of others. One woman, Connie DuVall, said the police were out in force questioning women in the neighborhood last winter, then disappeared and only returned recently.
Ms. Newmaster, for example, was well known at the Dunkin' Donuts, said its manager, John Winkler.
"Everybody knew what she was," said Mr. Winkler. "She tried here, so we ran her off."
Mr. Francois, a burly man 6 feet 4 inches tall who often stopped by the Dunkin' Donuts for a chocolate cruller, would search out women in his white station wagon, said Melissa Goebel, an 18-year-old mother of two who said she was a friend of several of the prostitutes.
People who knew him casually described him as mild-mannered and pleasant, although workers and students at the Arlington Middle School where Mr. Francois patrolled halls and the cafeteria said he often acted improperly with girls, embracing them, stroking their hair or punishing them with lunchtime detention so he could spend time with them.
"He gave out lots of detentions for everything," said Giovanna Vellone, 17.

HEADLINE: North Koreans May Be Preparing Another Missile Test

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 3

 BODY:
North Korea may be preparing to test another missile, American and Japanese officials said today, even as North Korean diplomats met in New York to discuss their missile and nuclear programs with American officials.
The United States has detected a flurry of activity at the same military base along North Korea's northeastern coast used to launch a two-stage ballistic missile on Monday, an American Government official said. 
 But, the official added, it appeared that North Korea was making preparations to test one or more of its older missiles, not the advanced missile tested for the first time three days ago by firing it in an arc over Japan.
The preparations suggest that North Korea's reclusive Government, led by Kim Jong Il, was brushing aside international protests over Monday's test, which has inflamed tensions in the region.
Japan and South Korea, responding to North Korea's preparations at the site about 20 miles north of Kimchaek, placed their militaries on higher states of alert today. Their Foreign Ministers, Masahiko Komura and Hong Soon Young, met in Tokyo to discuss how to respond to North Korea's tests.
Japan has withdrawn an offer to begin talks on establishing diplomatic relations with North Korea and suspended a $1 billion payment to the Korean Energy Development Organization, the international agency building reactors in the North in exchange for North Korea's pledge in 1994 to halt construction of nuclear weapons.
In New York, North Korea's Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Kim Gye Gwan, met into the night with an American delegation led by Charles Kartman, the State Department's special envoy for Korea. The talks broke off, and Administration officials said it was possible they would resume on Friday. Officials declined to give details of what they had discussed in today's talks.
While the Clinton Administration has officially voiced concern over North Korea's test, the response has been unusually understated. Some officials have played down the significance of the test, and of the later activity detected at the launch site.
"While there is activity around the launch site, it is not at all certain there is going to be any kind of test," an official said.
But a senior Japanese official said his Government had been specifically warned by the United States that a second missile launch was likely in the next few days.
Even as the launch site buzzed with activity, the European Union today called on North Korea to refrain from further tests. A statement issued by Austria, in its capacity as the union's current president, said the tests inflamed tensions. The statement also deplored the fact that North Korea would devote resources to missile development while its people faced severe hunger.
On Wednesday, the Pentagon announced that it would send six powerful bombers -- three B-52's and three B-2's -- to Guam on a previously unscheduled training exercise, but officials were adamant that the decision to send them to the Pacific over this coming weekend had nothing to do with North Korea.
Monday's test of a two-stage, medium-range missile, called the Taepodong-1, represented a significant advance in North Korea's missile program, according to arms experts. The missile can carry conventional or nuclear weapons and has a range of 900 to 1,200 miles, putting all of Japan within striking distance.
The first stage of the missile soared into the sky and then dropped into the Sea of Japan. The second stage continued over Japan's main island before plunging into the Pacific, 360 miles northeast of the American military base in Misawa.
Until now, North Korea had only tested a single-stage missile, called the Nodong, which has a shorter range and is considered unreliable. North Korea tested the Nodong only once, in 1993. It also has two variants of the Scud missile, originally developed by the Soviet Union.
North Korea could be planning to follow up Monday's test with new tests of those missiles, the American official said. After testing the Nodong in 1993, North Korea fired three Scuds into the Sea of Japan.
In another indication that North Korea might be preparing more tests, the officials said today, North Korea had issued a maritime alert to ships passing through the Sea of Japan, indicating that there could be military activity in the area until Sept. 20.
The United States has 37,000 troops in South Korea and 44,000 in Japan. The Taepodong would bring all of them within striking distance of North Korea.

HEADLINE: New Hollywood Studio Wrangles Over Project

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Sept. 3

 BODY:
It was the high-tech vision that was supposed to make the dream in Dreamworks come true, the first newly built Hollywood studio in nearly 60 years, nestled in a 1,000-acre tract amid the coastal wetlands where Howard Hughes built his giant seaplane, the Spruce Goose.
But now Dreamworks SKG, the studio partnership of Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen, is threatening to pull out of the proposed Playa Vista development in the Ballona Wetlands just north of Los Angeles International Airport. And city officials here are warning that if Dreamworks goes, the whole residential-office-retail project may be in jeopardy. 
 It is a classic clash of Hollywood egos and New York investors, and it involves not only money but also local power politics and a newly resurgent real estate market in a battle for a piece of the booming movie business that has filled up existing studio space and helped fuel the region's economic recovery. In essence, the developers, led by the investment houses of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Company and Goldman, Sachs & Company, want to impose more costs and conditions for building the new studio than Dreamworks is willing to accept.
In recent days, in anonymous sniping in the trade press and leaked letters, each side has accused the other of bad faith and of working to sabotage the deal. The developer's camp has questioned whether Dreamworks, which is still feeling its way nearly four years after its founding, really wants to build its own studio after all, while Dreamworks allies speculate that the developer is trying get higher-paying tenants and a better return on its investment now that the local real estate market is hot again.
"Dreamworks has given all that it can give," Mr. Katzenberg wrote to the developers last month in a letter that also included threats to look elsewhere.
"We are truly at a point where we cannot, and will not, give any more," he added in the letter, a copy of which was sent to Mayor Richard J. Riordan, Gov. Pete Wilson and other officials. The letter has since become public and has led to the latest round of wrangling over a project that has been stalled for three years.
Dreamworks wants enough land to build and operate its own headquarters and studios, up to 15 state-of-the-art sound stages at a cost of about $200 million. But the developer, Playa Capital, which took control of the site last year after the original investors' financing collapsed, now wants to develop at least some studio space on its own, and then lease it back to Dreamworks or other users at rates that Dreamworks officials say are unrealistic and exorbitant.
"In the world of stupid ideas, that's an Olympic winner," said one senior Dreamworks executive, speaking on condition of anonymity and adding that it would be far preferable for the studio to continue renting production space as needed from existing studios.
But in an intense public lobbying campaign this week, Dreamworks has hardly behaved like a player ready to fold its cards. Instead, it has repeatedly flashed them, enlisting the vocal support of state and local officials to reinforce its position that its involvement is crucial to the overall project's success. Mr. Riordan has offered to help mediate, and even the head of the Motion Picture Association, Jack Valenti, has weighed in.
Indeed, the city and state originally agreed to provide more than $70 million in incentives and employment tax credits to the project on the basis of Dreamworks' involvement in it, and local community and environmental groups long wary of development in one of the last remaining stretches of coastal wetlands in greater Los Angeles also lent their support, largely on the basis of Dreamworks' tenancy and a plan to restore much of the wetlands. This week such groups warned the developer against upsetting that balance.
"Recent statements by the new owners of Playa Vista force me to question those commitments," City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, who represents the area, said this week.
But Peter Denniston, president of Playa Capital, issued a statement on Wednesday noting that the developer cannot deviate from the current city-approved plan without additional review and City Council approval.
"We see this condition not as a constraint but rather as a testament to our conviction to stand by our promises," Mr. Denniston said.
Dreamworks announced its plan with great fanfare three years ago in the old hangar where the Spruce Goose was built in World War II. The new studio, the first one built here since Warner Brothers moved to the San Fernando Valley in the 1930's, was to be the anchor of a special media district that would create nearly 9,000 jobs and 3,000 housing units and generate billions of dollars in revenue for the city.
"When you have a full-fledged studio, the quality of the job is higher, the pay level is higher and there's a sense of endurance and continuity," Mr. Valenti said in a telephone interview from Paris this week. "It's the difference between owning your car and renting one."
But after months of financing problems and public wrangling with Dreamworks, the original local developer, Robert Maguire, lost control of the project last year, and the studio had to begin negotiations over again with the new owners. The project was also held up by litigation by some environmental groups, although a Federal court has so far temporarily barred work on only 16 acres, most of it centered in a freshwater marsh, pending a fuller review by the Army Corps of Engineers.
In the meantime, the local real estate market had sharply rebounded, and the new owners and the moguls spent much of the last year haggling over terms.
In exchange for the tax credits and intangible marquee value that Dreamworks would bring to the project, the developer agreed to give the studio a plot of land -- Dreamworks says it was 35 acres -- at no cost. But the studio contended that it needed 12 more acres, and reluctantly agreed this summer to pay the developer $20 million for it, according to Mr. Katzenberg's letter.
But then, Mr. Katzenberg wrote, the developer increased the price to more than $48 million, an amount Mr. Katzenberg dismissed as "completely unacceptable." And Dreamworks said the developer sent a subsequent proposal offering even less free land, and the idea of divided control of the sound stages, in which Dreamworks would control some and Playa Capital the rest. It was this proposal that appeared to particularly outrage the studio.
"We have a better deal with most of the studios around town today than we would have with Playa Capital," one Dreamworks official said. "They simply do not understand this business at all."
Playa Capital officials declined to comment in any detail on the negotiations, except to say, as the vice president of corporate affairs, David A. Herbst, put it: "The bottom line is we want to make it happen. We want to do whatever we can to make Dreamworks a part of Playa Vista."
But one person close to the negotiations, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that the developer had been renting out the vast old Hughes hangar and surrounding buildings as sound stages since 1994, and that there still seemed room for compromise.
From the beginning, the Dreamworks partners themselves had varying views of the project, with Mr. Spielberg pressing hardest for it while Mr. Geffen, who became a billionaire in the record business and has always liked to operate with low overhead, was reluctant to invest so heavily in real estate.
Mr. Katzenberg, who cut his teeth as a young City Hall aide in the administration of former Mayor John V. Lindsay of New York, has taken the lead in negotiations, and one Dreamworks official said the partners now seemed more united in their determination to proceed, if not at Playa Vista then by expanding their existing operation on the Universal Studios lot or some other site.

Stamford Rents Rise As Firms Move In

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
As more businesses have moved to Stamford, Conn., an increased demand for housing there has led to skyrocketing rents.
The monthly cost of a studio or a one-bedroom apartment has risen to between $750 and $1,800 this year, from $700 to $1,300 a month in 1997, according to William Pitt Relocation Corporate Services. 
 The average price of a home sold in Stamford in the last six months was $371,000, a figure that is also rising, according to Century 21 A & B Realty.
In the last two years, several companies have moved to the city, including UBS A.G., formerly known as Swiss Bank, which moved its North American headquarters and about 2,700 employees from New York City. The Louis Dreyfus Property Group plans to build a 500,000-square-foot office tower in Stamford.

HEADLINE: NYC;
In Berkshires, A Baseball Tip For the Bronx

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN 

 BODY:
SUMMER vacation in the Berkshires included, by custom, a family pilgrimage to Wahconah Park in Pittsfield, Mass., where the minor-league Pittsfield Mets set up shop from June to September. In case you wonder about the name, they are the New York-Penn League offspring of the better-known Mets of Flushing Meadows, Queens.
Wahconah Park (capacity 4,000) offers baseball the way it was meant to be: in an intimate setting, with splendid seats for the general admission price of $2.50 and with no silly distractions like exploding scoreboards, guys in chicken suits telling you when to clap or luxury skyboxes that make a mockery of the game's egalitarian roots. 
 But for all its pleasures, Wahconah is showing its age. It was built in 1919, four years before Yankee Stadium opened, and the summer has been filled with cries of how Pittsfield sorely needs a new ball field. Sound vaguely familiar?
Some New Yorkers may be interested in the relationship between the ball club and its neighborhood. Pittsfield has fallen on hard times, having endured its share of economic body blows, like General Electric pulling up stakes a few years ago. But you do not hear the local Mets talk trash about the community that has sustained it.
"It's a question of being out in the community and being a part of it," said Richard Murphy, the team's general manager.
"We have to look at what our mission statement is," he added, "and that's affordable family entertainment."
Thoughts turned to Mr. Murphy during a rain delay at Yankee Stadium on Wednesday night (in a so-so seat near the right-field foul pole that cost $20). It was hard not to contrast his remarks with the behavior of the Yankees' owner, George M. Steinbrenner 3d of Tampa, Fla., who has continued to bad-mouth the Bronx gratuitously despite the millions he makes there and despite the season attendance record his team is close to setting.
Mission? Mr. Steinbrenner makes clear that his is not to be part of a community but rather to take New York City for what he can in his quest for a new ball park. It certainly isn't to provide affordable family entertainment, not with his lust for so many luxury boxes that Yankees baseball risks becoming the preserve of the wealthy and the corporately connected.
Only George Steinbrenner can add a sour note to this enchanted season when the Yankees may become the winningest team of the century. Haven't they already provided enough magic to carry this city through the bleakest winter? Not to their bilious owner. "I really don't care about how many victories we get this year, I really don't," he said last month. "What I care about is the playoffs."
In the spring, City Hall politicians allowed this man's ambitions to make a mess of their municipal budget negotiations. Now, because of him, they are set to clutter the November ballot with one dubious referendum or another.
THIS may be as good a time as any to note how generous New York has already been to the Yankees -- and, for that matter, to the Mets. Compare that with the city's contract with the United States Tennis Association, a favorable deal for New York even if its Yankees-adoring Mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, does not think so. (No doubt, it is purely a coincidence that this agreement was reached by David N. Dinkins, his tennis-loving predecessor.)
In the last 10 years, the tennis association has paid the city $5.3 million in rent for its United States Open matches in Flushing Meadows, compared with $2.1 million paid by the Yankees and $2 million by the Mets for the use of their stadiums. Bear in mind that the Open, now under way, lasts a mere two weeks while the regular baseball season is six months long.
What makes the tennis deal shine is that the Dinkins administration required the association to pay all maintenance costs. By contrast, the Yankees and Mets get to deduct those expenses from their rent bill. And Mr. Steinbrenner has not been above an occasional chisel. Some years, his accounting had the city owing him money. Once, he tried dunning the city for an engineer who supposedly worked 168 hours a week. Guess how many hours there are in a week.
Anyway, all this is something New Yorkers may wish to ponder in the thickening battle over a new playground for the Yankees owner. How did the Pittsfield man put it? "It's a question of being out in the community and being a part of it."

HEADLINE: Labor and the Left: Getting Cozy Again;
But Common Goals May Not Be Enough to Revive a Potent Alliance

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
For the last three decades, two groups that should be obvious bedfellows -- the labor movement and leftist intellectuals -- have far more often acted as enemies than as allies.
Close partners throughout the first half of this century, these two had an ugly breakup in the 1960's over Vietnam, integration and the vehemence of cold war anti-Communism. 
 But with the end of the cold war and with leadership changes in the house of labor, unions and left-of-center intellectuals have concluded that they might have a lot in common after all. Eager to counter the rise of the right and growing corporate dominance of the economy and culture, labor and the left have attempted a reconciliation over the last two years. To what degree this rapprochement will succeed, however, very much remains an open question.
In candid moments, several intellectuals who have fostered the reconciliation acknowledge that one of their main goals is to end their exile from power and the public policy arena. In the 1960's, liberal-left thinkers like Arthur Schlesinger Jr., John Kenneth Galbraith and Michael Harrington had the White House's ear, but by the 1980's, the right was clearly winning the war of ideas as much of its agenda gained acceptance even with Democrats.
A decade ago the A.F.L.-C.I.O., preoccupied with toppling Communism overseas, added insult to the left's insignificance by allying itself with neoconservative intellectuals -- the nemesis of labor's new-found friends.
"This is a way out of the ghetto, out of marginalization, a way to once again have our ideas taken seriously and to move public policy and the cultural values of the country in what we think is a more progressive direction," said Steven Fraser, who wrote a biography of Sidney Hillman, president of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers, and was a prime mover in bringing left intellectuals and labor back together.
These labor-friendly academics, writers and artists, often call themselves social democrats and include veterans of Students for a Democratic Society, graduates of the Berkeley Free Speech Movement and disciples of the Socialist leaders, Norman Thomas and Michael Harrington. There is also a smattering of red-diaper babies and of academics who were pulled left by the civil rights movement and legendary labor leaders like Cesar Chavez. This pro-labor group first banded together publicly in January 1996, three months after John J. Sweeney was elected A.F.L.-C.I.O. president, promising to help lift the poorest workers and to expand labor's influence and size after decades of decline. Encouraged by Mr. Sweeney's approach, more than 30 prominent intellectuals signed a letter to The New York Review of Books vowing to support labor's renaissance.
This Who's Who of left-of-center thinkers and writers included Paul Berman, Barbara Ehrenreich, Betty Friedan, Henry Louis Gates Jr., Robert Heilbroner, Jonathan Kozol, Richard Rorty, Cornel West, Alfred Kazin and Mr. Schlesinger.
"We believe the revitalization of the American labor movement can fashion a new politics of social solidarity and economic justice, and reverse the country's descent into the kind of mean-spirited selfishness that so discolors the contemporary political scene," they wrote. "It is the most heartening development in our nation's political life since the heyday of the civil rights movement a third of a century ago."
Leftist intellectuals and labor both want a country with less corporate dominance, with more social protections and with more democratic participation in government and in the workplace. Both want American workers to have more security and a fairer share of the nation's economic wealth, leading both to support universal health insurance and a higher minimum wage.
These writers and university professors have been following a tradition that dates from organized labor's formative years in the late 1800's all the way through its heyday in the 1930's and 1940's. In those years, luminaries like the philosopher John Dewey, the economist Charles Beard and the novelists Upton Sinclair, Theodore Dreiser and John Dos Passos wrote books and essays that furthered labor's cause. These intellectuals are responding to appeals from Dewey and Richard Rorty, widely considered the nation's leading living philosopher and a champion of the labor-left alliance, that intellectuals were too inward looking and should not ignore social problems.
"In 1960, if you were on the left, the left was always asking, 'What is the vehicle, to increase power?' " said Nelson Lichtenstein, a University of Virginia history professor and a biographer of Walter Reuther, the auto workers' leader. "Back then, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the civil rights movement were unquestionably the dynamic movement that one had to orient to. Today, to the extent there's any movement's that has the potential for dynamic possibilities, it's the labor movement."
Hoping to build a social movement, Mr. Sweeney has encouraged the alliance with intellectuals, as well as ones with civil rights groups, women's organizations and religious leaders. "The labor movement needs to win the war of ideas in addition to other wars that are going on," said Robert Welsh, Mr. Sweeney's executive assistant and his liaison with intellectuals. "The whole conversation with progressive scholars, writers and artists is critically important to having a vibrant, outward-looking labor movement as opposed to an inward-looking, moribund one."
Nonetheless, some union leaders quietly share the sentiment of Samuel Gompers, the founder of the American Federation of Labor, who feared that aloof intellectuals, often with a utopian bent, might be more hindrance than help.
And not surprisingly, the neoconservatives who were labor's friends a decade ago ridicule the intellectual left, branding them desperate midgets eager to piggyback on the labor giant so they once again can be seen and heard. "It's not a new strategy," said Norman Podhoretz, one of the fathers of neoconservatism. "What you have is a movement with all of these warm bodies and a big treasury, and if you're a small splinter group somewhere on the left, it's not a bad idea to hook up with a movement like that. I do not believe there is much good that will come of this alliance."
For many intellectuals, however, their new embrace of labor gives them an opportunity to climb down from the ivory tower and ally their yin with a brawny, powerful yang that they have long envied from afar. And while the intellectuals talk repeatedly about how their goal is to help the less fortunate, a few admit to some self-interest in forming the alliance. With universities relying increasingly on low-paid adjuncts to teach classes, many academics say they need to join arms with labor to prevent their own exploitation.
"We as academics are increasingly under attack and are experiencing many of the same problems that workers are, workers who are paid much less than we are," said Daniel Clawson, a sociology professor at the University of Massachusetts. "It's difficult to see how we can solve our problems without alliances and support. If we talk about part-time and contingent workers, it's not only U.P.S. and the teamsters. It's what's happening in the universities."
So far the most tangible fruits of the alliance have been two dozen teach-ins at universities around the country. There, scholars and union leaders have dissected and denounced stagnating wages, growing corporate might, globalization's squeeze on workers and management's offensive against unionization drives. A frequent refrain at these teach-ins is that something is badly awry in this richest of nations when millions of full-time workers remain caught below the poverty line and the percentage of workers without health insurance and pensions is growing.
"The teach-ins make labor issues more salient in the minds of students," said Eric Foner, a Columbia University history professor who was master of ceremonies at the first labor teach-in, a standing-room-only affair at Columbia in October 1996. "Many students here have never met a member of a labor union except the person who cleans up on campus. These are students coming from rather privileged backgrounds, and it's important for them to be exposed to some of the reasons why the labor movement is so vital."
Through the teach-ins, the alliance has helped funnel hundreds of students into the labor movement to work as organizers. These intellectuals have formed an organization, Scholars, Artists and Writers for Social Justice, with 1,500 members and an acronym pronounced "sausage." The group has encouraged members to write pro-labor op-ed pieces and has pulled scores of pro-union academics together at the annual meetings of the nation's sociologists and political scientists.
This alliance has not taken the world by storm, however, as the left (intellectual and otherwise) continues to languish and labor remains far less potent than a half-century ago when John L. Lewis, the thundering president of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, was as well known as Bill Gates is today.
Even some of the movers behind the alliance, like Mr. Fraser and Professor Foner, voice disappointment that the partnership has not captured the nation's attention and that labor has still not climbed back onto center stage in politics and social policy. Their goal is to make labor as vocal and powerful as it was a half century ago, but with unions representing 14 percent of all workers, down from 35 percent, that will not be easy.
Labor and its intellectual friends also face an uphill battle because globalization and the Gingrich revolution have repeatedly thrown unions on the defensive. In addition, the teamsters' campaign finance scandal and other eruptions of union corruption have tarred unions badly just as they are trying to win more members and public backing.
Daniel Bell, the Harvard sociologist and longtime student of unions, said he doubted the labor-left alliance would amount to much. "For the intellectuals, it's a lot of wishful thinking; I don't mean that in an invidious way," he said. "The real test will be whether labor has the ability to expand its numbers. Simply becoming more rhetorical and becoming more active politically is not in and of itself enough."

HEADLINE: Falling Prices For Oil Impede Iraq Aid Plan

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 4

 BODY:
Recent sharp drops in the price of oil have undermined a program under which Iraq can sell its oil to raise money for urgent civilian needs like food and medicine, the senior official in charge of the program told the Security Council today.
The official, Benon Sevan, briefing the Security Council on a report on Iraq from the Secretary General, said the reduced earnings from oil sales would mean that the United Nations could not meet a higher nutritional target in food supplied monthly to every Iraqi. 
 Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of food and medicine have been shipped to Iraq since the program began a little over a year ago, a United Nations spokesman in Baghdad, Eric Falt, said on Thursday.
This week, the largest ship to arrive in Iraq under the program, a 52,000-ton Greek freighter, brought a shipment of American red winter wheat. American companies have won nearly $35 million in grain contracts with Iraq under the program.
The "oil for food" program was increased substantially in February, to $5.2 billion from $2.1 billion in oil sales every six months. This followed growing reports of malnutrition and deaths caused by lack of medication and medical supplies. The quantities were fixed in a formula based on the price of oil in February.
After subtracting money set aside for compensation to victims of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and other built-in deductions, Iraq should have had several billion dollars for aid expenditures. But lower oil prices have reduced the expected amount available to about $1.79 billion for this six-month period.
To complicate matters, the distribution of supplies, especially medicines, has been delayed. The reasons cited in the report included poor communications with health centers, Iraq's extended quality control testing of imports and the tendency of Iraqi officials to hold back stocks for what they say are emergency needs.
Moreover, Iraq is not able to pump all the oil permitted under the expanded agreement because of the run-down condition of its oil industry.
Hopes of increasing the volume of oil sales to compensate in some part for the lower prices have not been met because of delays in approving contracts for spare parts.
The delays are taking place in the Security Council's sanctions committee on Iraq, where the United States has challenged contracts despite the recommendation of oil experts hired by the United Nations to review Iraqi purchases. Iraq is often suspected of trying to import items beyond what it needs. The country has been under stringent sanctions for eight years.
Bill Richardson, the departing American representative to the United Nations and the new Energy Secretary, said there was no change in the American position.
"The United States is ready to assist the Iraqi people with humanitarian needs," Mr. Richardson said after Mr. Sevan's briefing. "We're ready to approve oil spare-parts contracts provided that they deal with improving the oil delivery efficiency system for the Iraqi people to get humanitarian assistance. For other purposes we will not approve them -- for frivolous purposes."

HEADLINE: Accidental Tourists Need Not Apply Here$ %;
It Takes Methodical Planning to Lure Visitors to Far Corner of Texas

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

DATELINE: CORPUS CHRISTI, Tex.

 BODY:
The world surely is wide enough to hold a few more tourist attractions, and this city of 400,000 people has tried mightily to fill the bill.
And why not? After all, other cities in the United States have fashioned successful tourist industries by virtue of natural setting, vision or sometimes good luck.
These include Branson, Mo., a year-round country music capital; Tunica, Miss., a town that is climbing out of rank poverty with glitzy hotels and glitzier gambling casinos, and such shopping meccas as Potomac Mills outlet mall in Dale City, Va., which draws more tourists than Colonial Williamsburg. Then there is Newport, Ore., where the arrival of Keiko the whale (of "Free Willy" fame) has attracted one million more visitors to the Oregon Coast Aquarium and has the town's 9,000 residents pondering what will become of its multimillion-dollar tourist industry after Keiko is returned to a sea pen in its native Iceland on Sept. 9. 
 But Corpus Christi, a socially conservative and heavily Hispanic city, has few spectacular natural assets or claims to fame. Instead, it has pursued tourism methodically, investing millions to try to overcome hard strokes of geographical misfortune. And success is already evident in the rising number of visitors.
"We don't ever expect to become another Orlando or Las Vegas, because we understand what kind of tourist destination we are -- primarily a beach town," said Mike Crouch, director of public affairs for the Greater Corpus Christi Business Alliance. "But we hope to attract lots more tourists and convention delegates and have them stay longer."
Known mostly for its oil industry, which fell on hard times starting in the late 1980's, the city is tucked within a lovely bay behind Padre Island on the Gulf of Mexico, way down in southeast Texas, more than 200 miles from Houston and almost 400 miles from Dallas. As a former tourist official said, "You don't get to Corpus Christi by accident; you have to work at getting here."
Most air service to and from the city is on regional carriers, and nonstops to other states are nonexistent. Even a flight to El Paso, for example, 720 road miles away, typically takes four to six hours, depending on connections and stops.
Though a number of Corpus Christi hotels and attractions are worth bragging about -- one is a life-size statue of Selena Quintanilla Perez, 23, the Queen of Tejano, or Texas-Mexican borderland music, who was shot dead by her fan club president in 1995 -- they are a far cry from the snazzy theme parks or casinos that pack in the crowds elsewhere. Thus, the great bulk of Corpus Christi tourists are still likely to come from within a 150-mile radius.
With its large Hispanic population and proximity to Mexico, Corpus Christi is especially determined to attract a larger share of the three million Mexican tourists and convention delegates who spent almost $900 million in the state last year.
And so it was that city officials set about building a tourist industry that did more than attract penny-pinching college students on spring break or day-trippers to its many beaches.
Dead set against the "build it and they'll come" mentality, Corpus Christi officials have been careful to order economic impact studies before plunking down a dime to buy attractions.
For example, the go-ahead for a $33 million aquarium, which opened in 1990, was given only after studies projected that it would make money -- and after a look at the success of Baltimore's aquarium and Inner Harbor. Averaging about 440,000 visitors a year, the aquarium is now credited with adding $50 million a year to Corpus Christi's economy.
The city also spent $4.1 million for the U.S.S. Lexington, the legendary World War II aircraft carrier, after spirited bidding with Quincy, Mass., and Mobile, Ala. But first the city received reassurance from Debbie Prost, head of what is now Prost Marketing Inc., a San Antonio consulting firm, that the ship would draw far more than the 270,000 visitors a year needed to break even. Even then, officials also studied the success of six other cities that had former Navy ships as tourist sites. Since opening in October 1992, the Lexington has averaged almost 350,000 visitors a year and has contributed $62 million a year.
The ship and the aquarium have also spruced up North Beach, a section of the city that was badly damaged in a hurricane in 1971.
"When I grew up in this city," said Frank Stanford of College Station, Tex., "North Beach was infested with drugs and crime. But as you can see, today it's filled with families." Mr. Stanford was showing Corpus Christi's attractions to a friend, Diane Havalda of Austin. As he spoke, lots of children scampered around the aquarium.
The $20 million Greyhound Race Track, opened in 1990 and owned by a Florida corporation that was able to qualify for certain tax rebates available under a state enterprise zone, continues to attract many out-of-staters who spend the winter months in Texas. But the track has been overshadowed somewhat since the state lottery began in 1992.
The only sizable investment that has not lived up to promise is the $1.1 million paid to Spain for the right to operate and manage replicas of the Nina, Pinta and Santa Maria, the fleet that Columbus sailed to the New World more than 500 years ago. Although the fleet has attracted 650,000 paying customers since opening five years ago, the Pinta and the Santa Maria were damaged in 1994, when a tow cable snapped and a barge crashed into them. Repairs by Spanish shipwrights were completed only this summer.
A small zoo and a botanical garden have recently been added to Corpus Christi's tourism mix, the Asian Cultures Museum moved into a new building, and the Museum of Science and History was extensively remodeled and expanded.
As a result of all these efforts, the number of visitors grew to 5.5 million in 1997, from fewer than 2.3 million in 1986 -- a 139 percent increase during a time when total United States tourism grew about 89 percent. Hotel room revenues doubled, to $100.4 million. Tourism-related jobs also doubled, to 10,200, and the tourism-related payroll almost tripled, to $152 million. The average visitor's stay, which had never been more than a day, grew to 2.5 days.
The Convention Center in Bayfront Plaza booked 151,679 convention delegates in 1996, the last year for those figures available, a 60 percent increase over 1986.
Still, for all the growth, Corpus Christi doesn't approach the number of visitors to Orlando, Fla. (35.6 million in 1996), Las Vegas (30.5 million) or even San Antonio, which recorded 7 million visitors last year.
Moreover, not all the improvements, including the trendy restaurants, sleek office buildings and modern hotels along the two-mile-long white waterfront seawall and walkway, are a result of tourism. The petrochemical industry, for example, pumps more than $1 billion into the local economy, while the city's growing health care services employ about 24,000 people.
It was the collapse of Corpus Christi's decades-long dependence on gas and oil that sent the city reeling when the price of domestic oil plummeted from $40 a barrel in 1980 to $10 in 1986.
"In 1986, unemployment reached a decade high of 12.2 percent, and we lost 5,000 jobs in the oil and gas exploration industry," said Gary E. Bushell, president of the area business alliance. Just between 1986 and 1988, hotel revenues fell from $45.5 million to $38.7 million.
Bill Pruet, a small-business owner, former city councilman and chairman of the business alliance's tourism committee, said: "For almost 100 years oil and gas provided our tax base, funded our schools and created our jobs. Every big oil company was here. But when oil went down the chute, they just abandoned those offices and pulled out. When it was agreed to really go after tourists, we knew we had to go beyond just T-shirts and kids on the beach."
Tourism indeed remains at the forefront of Corpus Christi's effort to make a name for itself while adding jobs and earning money.
While hoping (and lobbying) to attract cruise ships, the city has formed a partnership with San Antonio whereby cruise passengers can also fly to that mission city before or after their cruise, to visit the Alamo or the city's acclaimed River Walk.
It has also established a tourism and trade office in Monterrey, Mexico, together with its Texas neighbor, Laredo, and the Port of Corpus Christi, the nation's sixth-largest port.
A big drawing card for Mexican and Mexican-American tourists is the Selena statue. In the middle of the nine seawall pavilions along Ocean Drive, the bronze statue continues to attract legions of fans, young and old.
"We came mostly for the beach," said Roberto Leal of Monterrey, on his first visit here recently with two related families that together consisted of 10 adults and 12 children. "But we don't want to go home without seeing the aquarium and the memorial to Selena."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasuries AreA Bit Higher In Short Session

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities traded mostly higher in an abbreviated session yesterday, as a decline in stocks led nervous investors to seek safety in bonds.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 8/32, to 103 8/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, dropped to 5.28 percent, from 5.30 percent on Thursday. The Treasury market closed early yesterday, two hours before the 4 P.M. closing bell of the New York Stock Exchange, which might have prompted some investors to be cautious going into a long holiday weekend. Markets will be closed on Monday in observance of Labor Day.
For the week, the benchmark long-bond yield was down 5 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. 
 The August employment report had little impact on the market. The report showed that the return of workers following two strikes against General Motors helped swell payrolls by 365,000 jobs and kept the unemployment rate at 4.5 percent.
Anthony Chan, managing director and chief economist at the Banc One Investment Advisors Corporation in Columbus, Ohio, said that although the credit markets were focusing more heavily on world developments than on domestic economic data, the employment report was fairly market-friendly.
Mr. Chan said that the average nonfarm payroll jobs gain for the months of July and August raced ahead of the first-quarter average but came in well below that of the second-quarter average. "Such evidence suggests that we should not expect too much further firming on the wage front in the months ahead," he said.
He also noted that many traders were looking ahead to a speech last night by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, at the University of California at Berkeley. A number of traders, Mr. Chan said, "refused to rule out the possibility that a more friendly Fed posture would be revealed by the chairman."
"If so, his comments would certainly go a long way in coloring the path of trading" during the next couple of trading sessions, he said.
Bonds were also bolstered by a strong dollar in currency trading.

HEADLINE: Claims Processor Loses Contract With Blue Cross

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, SEPT. 4

 BODY:
Allied Specialty Services, a claims-processing company for four of New Jersey's largest health maintenance organizations, has been dropped by one of these managed care insurers, and its contract with another is being reviewed.
Allied, which is based in Florida, lost its account with H.M.O. Blue, the state's second largest H.M.O., which announced the decision in a letter last Monday. The contract was canceled two days before doctors and some health consumer groups publicly accused Allied of delaying, denying and decreasing claims payments to specialists in a way that threatened the solvency of some medical practices and distorting the decisions of health care providers. Allied has denied that such problems exist. 
 Allied had handled the claims for 553,000 of the state's 2.3 million H.M.O. customers.
In the letter on Monday, H.M.O. Blue notified the doctors in its plan that it was terminating its contract with Allied. Donna Celestini, the vice president for managed care with Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Jersey, which owns H.M.O. Blue, echoed the doctors' complaints about delays in payments in explaining why the company had ended its contract with Allied after just 18 months. Figures were not available for the amount H.M.O. Blue paid Allied during that period. The H.M.O. will process the claims itself, she said.
Ms. Celestini said that the company's cost of monitoring Allied and the many complaints was exceeding any savings Blue Cross had anticipated from the arrangement. She said that Allied appeared to have "expanded too fast, too soon" in the state in an effort to capture a share of the H.M.O. market. Months of negotiations did not succeed in improving Allied's handling of claims, she said.
Elizabeth Schmuck, a spokeswoman for another of Allied's customers, NYLCare Health Plans, which was recently acquired by Aetna, the state's largest H.M.O., said that in light of the complaints made by the group of doctors and consumers on Wednesday, NYLCare was reviewing those complaints and its relationship with Allied.
Kevin Heine, a spokesman for Prudential H.M.O., another Allied client, however, expressed surprise at the complaints, saying that during Prudential's nearly 10-month-old contract with Allied, there had been no serious complaints and that the company had "met or exceeded" the on-time payment goals set for it. Calls to the fourth company, Cigna H.M.O., seeking comment on its relationship with Allied were not returned today.
Allied, in a statement released today from its corporate headquarters, said that H.M.O. Blue's decision to handle claims itself was a function of that company's business needs changing over time. It did not address the specifics of the criticisms in claims processing.
On Wednesday, doctors from the Medical Society of New Jersey and the Physicians Union of New Jersey and consumer health advocates accused the company of delaying payment on bills up to 90 days, losing paperwork and frequently substituting their judgment for the doctors' on necessary treatment by refusing to pay for certain levels of care. The problem was all the more frustrating, they said, because third-party administrators such as Allied were not insurance companies subject to direct regulation by state insurance commissioners.
Health economists say that with the growth of managed care, third-party administrators like Allied Specialty Services have emerged in the last 15 years to sell their services to self-insured companies and union health plans that do not have the ability or expertise to process health care claims.
Dr. Alan Hillman, the director of the Center for Health Policy at the University of Pennsylvania, said that traditional insurers have turned to such companies for claims processing and review help only in the last five years, "when anything is possible in the health care business."
Dr. Hillman said that the introduction of yet another element in the equation involving doctors, patients and insurers has often led to delays, complaints and accusations that these new intermediaries were benefiting financially from such delays.
But James Robinson, a professor of health economics at the University of California at Berkeley, defended such entities as a helpful part of cost control in the changing health care industry. He said much of the criticism of them was "a red herring" put forward by doctors and others who were fighting a rear guard action against the entire managed care movement.
Originally called Allied Health Group, Allied Specialty Services was founded in 1987 in Boca Raton, Fla. Allied developed computer software that evaluated the fees charged by specialists in relation to national and regional norms, and it marketed itself as a company that could cut insurers' costs, root out fraud and catch frequent and costly filing mistakes by health care providers.
It operates in 12 states and processes about four million claims a year from 21 medical specialties. Last December, Allied was acquired by Magellan Health Services, a publicly owned managed care company based in Atlanta with offices in 35 states. Magellan paid $50 million for Allied, and the deal calls for $60 million more to be paid to Allied's founders should Allied meet certain earnings goals over the next three years.

HEADLINE: Reporter's Notebook;
The Faces of Clinton: Weary to Somber to Vibrant

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: LIMERICK, Ireland, Sept. 4

 BODY:
President Reagan's advisers were fond of saying that people never remember the words of a President, only the pictures.
If that is true, President Clinton this week offered a kaleidoscope of images played out on his face and in his gestures, from the pained confession of his "profound regret" about the Lewinsky matter to his compassion for the victims of the Omagh bombing. He was alternately engaged and distracted, buoyant and mournful. At times his eyes were locked in the thousand-yard stare of the soldier who has seen too much combat. His interactions with Hillary Rodham Clinton lurched from apparent affection to icy distance. 
 But the overwhelming impression was of a man exhausted and in distress who was able, when necessary, to put aside his private pain and reclaim the brave face of the practiced performer.
The week has taken a dizzying trajectory for the President, from the end of a restless 10-day vacation with his family on Martha's Vineyard to a therapeutic round of golf scheduled for Saturday afternoon on the ancient links at Ballybunion in southwest Ireland.
But in between, what a ride.
 
Presidents, Aging and Ashen
A somber President stepped off Air Force One into a cold drizzle in Moscow on Tuesday morning after a 10-hour overnight flight from Washington. He had the red, puffy eyes of the overnight traveler as he walked hand in hand with Mrs. Clinton down the steps of the plane.
He met that morning at the Kremlin with Boris N. Yeltsin, but there was none of the "Bill and Boris" jocularity of past meetings. The aging, ailing Russian leader moved with the awkward gestures of an invalid; Mr. Clinton appeared ashen, almost funereal.
Mr. Clinton was little better that afternoon in a speech in a Moscow university auditorium, a familiar kind of setting for him and one he usually plays to advantage. But his delivery was uncharacteristically flat, perhaps compounded by an impassive audience that did not once interrupt his remarks with applause.
Aides explained that Mr. Clinton was tired. Besides, one said, Russia's political paralysis "does not lend itself to laughter."
 
No Vodka This Time
That night, Mr. Yeltsin was the host at a state dinner in the Kremlin, but this was not the customary vodka-drenched, hours-long Russian affair. Neither Mr. Clinton nor Mr. Yeltsin was in the mood for hilarity.
Although he appeared attentive, Mr. Clinton's mind was on Wall Street, which the day before had suffered a 512-point nose dive.
Gene Sperling, the chief White House economic adviser, whispered in the President's ear that the market was bouncing back. Mr. Clinton grinned and gave him the thumb's-up sign.
 
In Search of a Smile
The American side had signaled to the Russians that the President had had a long day and asked that the dinner be abbreviated. Barely an hour after the party sat down to eat, the dinner broke up, an hour ahead of schedule.
At times, the President's demeanor matched his words. On others, they were strangely out of synch. Twice on this trip Mr. Clinton took questions from reporters. The first occasion was in a joint news conference in the Kremlin with Mr. Yeltsin. Mr. Clinton knew he would face questions about his relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky and the fallout from his bitter admission of Aug. 17.
As Mr. Yeltsin spoke, Mr. Clinton scanned the faces of reporters, looking for a sympathetic smile and trying to gauge the level of aggressiveness. Two of the three questions the President took were about the Lewinsky issue. He said he had made a mistake and asked for forgiveness. But he did not look as if he expected to get it. Cameras caught him at one point cradling his chin in his palms, looking like a weary businessman whose flight home had just been canceled.
 
For First Time: 'Sorry'
Mr. Clinton fielded questions about the Lewinsky matter again this morning, at a photo opportunity with Bertie Ahern, the Irish Prime Minister. Reporters clamored for a response to a damaging statement on Thursday from Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, a longtime ally of the President's.
Mr. Clinton said he deserved all the criticism he got and said for the first time that he was "sorry" about the affair. But his manner appeared anything but penitent.
He was oddly relaxed, almost jovial as he again admitted error and called his behavior "indefensible." If one watched the statement on television with the sound off, one might have guessed that Mr. Clinton was discussing Mark McGwire's chase for the home-run record.
The best day of the trip for Mr. Clinton was Wednesday, as he took a victory lap around Northern Ireland, encouraging work on the peace agreement he had helped broker and comforting the families of the victims of the bomb attack in Omagh.
This was the Bill Clinton of the 1992 campaign, with perfect emotional pitch in his remarks and a soothing arm for the bereaved. As he walked down Market Street in Omagh, scene of the deadly blast, he was caught wiping away a tear in a picture that dominated the front pages of several Irish newspapers.
 
Date With Ballybunion
The President's spirits were raised by the closeness throughout the day of Tony Blair, Britain's charismatic Prime Minister, a younger version of Mr. Clinton, without the baggage of scandal.
Mr. Clinton wandered back into the press compartment of Air Force One tonight on his way to Limerick and his date with Ballybunion on Saturday. He was somber but at ease, said the reporters who saw him. He said he had had a "wonderful time" in Ireland, but ducked substantive questions about policy or scandal.
He grew animated in discussing his golf date. He said he has been gathering tips from professionals on how to play the course and had been looking forward for weeks to the challenges of the wind-whipped links on an outcropping above the sea. "I'm going to be glad to get through it," Mr. Clinton said.
But this trip, and the two weeks before it, have taken their toll.
"I'm tired," said the President before returning to his cabin.

GRAPHIC: Photos: In the last week, President Clinton reflected a palette of contrasting moods: Darker, more pensive, while listening to reporters' questions with President Boris N. Yeltsin in the Kremlin and again while waiting to speak in Belfast, Northern Ireland. But lighter, indeed, light-hearted at times: In Moscow, a cheerful President held up an "I Love MGIMO" T-shirt (the acronym stands for Moscow State Institute for International Relations). And in Belfast, with Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain at his side, he offered a campaign-style salute after speaking. (Photographs by Reuters (top) and Associated Press (bottom))

HEADLINE: Payrolls Rose By 365,000 Last Month

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
Despite a sagging stock market and a growing trade deficit, America's labor market remains very solid.
The Labor Department reported yesterday that the return of workers idled by the 54-day strike at General Motors helped to keep the unemployment rate at 4.5 percent in August, close to its 30-year low, and helped to swell payrolls by 365,000 jobs. 
 Investors were not surprised by yesterday's report and digested its most obvious implication -- that it reduced the likelihood of an immediate interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve Board -- with apparent equanimity. By the end of the day, stock prices had fallen modestly in volatile trading, while bond prices had rallied.
Disregarding the effects of the G.M. strike, the economy churned out an average of 217,000 new jobs a month in July and August, slower than the 244,000 monthly rate in the year's first half but still a strong pace. Pay is rising at a good clip, too; total hours worked are up and first-time unemployment claims are at a 10-year low.
"In spite of everything that's out there, the general economy is growing at a pretty good pace," said Mitchell S. Fromstein, chief executive of Manpower Inc., the nation's largest supplier of temporary workers.
David Wyss, chief economist of Standard & Poor's DRI, said: "We're where we've been for the last four months. It's still a very tight labor market."
Until recently, the Fed's primary concern has been whether the economy would slow enough to head off the threat of inflation as companies compete for relatively scarce workers. If growth stays too strong or inflation picks up, the Fed could raise rates. Financial troubles abroad, though, have put the Fed in a bind, raising questions whether lower rates might be needed to encourage Americans to keep buying products made here and abroad to head off a downturn.
"There's nothing in this report that says ease," said Robert J. Barbera at Hoenig & Company, an investment consulting firm, in White Plains.
The issue now is how long the American labor market will stay this robust. Job numbers provide a better look at where the economy has been than at where it is headed.
"This is as good as it gets," said Edward Yardeni, chief economist of Deutsche Bank Securities. "All the risks are on the downside. If we're lucky, unemployment will stay this low. If we're not, more of the effects of the global recession will reach us."
The dark spot in the otherwise bright labor picture is a troubling weakness in manufacturing. Asia's economic problems are starting to take a bigger bite. Although total manufacturing hours worked rose sharply in August, suggesting that monthly industrial production may rise for the first time this summer, a total of 100,000 factory jobs disappeared in July and August, even taking into account the effects of the strike at General Motors.
Tom Nardone, an economist at the Labor Department, said that the pace of job losses had doubled from the two previous months. The biggest losses occurred among makers of clothing and electronic equipment and in food processing.
"Manufacturing is in a pricing recession," Mr. Yardeni said. "Not only can't they raise prices, but they're under a lot of pressure to cut prices because of the collapse of exports to Asia. As a result, profits are under pressure, and companies are starting to cut back on hiring."
The danger, he added, is that the weakness in manufacturing could spread to services.
"Services don't operate in a vacuum," Mr. Yardeni said. "Many of their customers are manufacturers." Manufacturers employ less than 15 percent of the work force, he points out, but account for 30 percent of all business activity.
Just about everywhere else in the labor market, however, jobs were sprouting last month.
Services -- from day care to management consulting -- added 135,000 jobs. Temporary-help companies accounted for 42,000 of that number, reversing a loss of a similar magnitude in July. Computer and data processing added 11,000 jobs. Transportation and public utilities added 24,000 jobs.
Finance, insurance and real estate added 13,000, substantially less than the pace of the last year or so. Mortgage lenders probably account for much of that gain, as low rates keep the home loan business humming.
A gain of 16,000 construction jobs reflects the continued boom in the building and buying of homes. Since last fall, construction has added 261,000 workers.
Government jobs rose by a strong 57,000, although that figure was probably exaggerated as early school starting dates in some parts of the country complicated attempts to make seasonal adjustments.
One-fifth of small businesses say their most pressing problem is an inability to find enough skilled help, according to the latest survey of the National Federation of Independent Business. Nonetheless, hiring in August was extremely strong.
The wage picture is positive. The increase in workers' average hourly earnings was half a percent, or 7 cents, in August, after a gain of two-tenths of a percent in July. The year-to-year increases, however, have flattened out at just over 4 percent in the last few months. Still, even though wage inflation does not seem to be accelerating, pay is rising fast enough to grant workers some of the best gains in real income in years.
Some of the biggest gains are going to workers at the bottom of the pay scale, said Mr. Fromstein of Manpower. He sees a tremendous amount of job hopping as low-wage hotel, fast-food and service workers take advantage of the extremely tight labor market to obtain better pay. "There just aren't enough people to fill these jobs," he said. "In an economy like this, when people making $7 an hour can get a job for a dollar more, they're getting a 15 percent raise."

Greenspan Hints at Cut In Rates Amid Global Crisis
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said that the central bankers were growing more concerned about the effect of the global financial crisis on the United States economy, and he seemed to open the door to consideration of a rate cut if the global situation continues to deteriorate.
In the spring and early summer, Federal Reserve policy makers were more concerned about the threat of renewed inflation, Mr. Greenspan said, and they adopted a policy stance signaling they stood ready to raise rates at the first sign of any significant inflation. But he said policy makers decided last month that the global turmoil posed a growing threat to prosperity. Page A1. 

Chernomyrdin Details Financial Plan
Russia's Acting Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, detailed a series of economic remedies that would shore up the nation's banking system and ease the country into an "econonomic dictatorship" where the money supply would be rigidly controlled and failing factories could face bankruptcy for the first time. The Parliament put off a vote on the new Government until Monday, buying more time for political negotiations. A6.
 
G.M. and Union Reach Saturn Pact
General Motors and the United Automobile Workers reached an accord at the auto maker's Saturn assembly plant in Spring Hill, Tenn., averting another strike. Details of the agreement were not disclosed, but both sides said it affirmed the plant's partnership between management and labor. C2.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Fed Chairman'sSpeech

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a speech last night by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, at the Walter A. Haas School of Business at the University of California at Berkeley.
It is just not credible that the United States can remain an oasis of prosperity unaffected by a world that is experiencing greatly increased stress. Developments overseas have contributed to holding down prices and aggregate demand in the United States in the face of strong domestic spending. As dislocations abroad mount, feeding back on our financial markets, restraint is likely to intensify. In the spring and early summer, the Federal Open Market Committee was concerned that a rise in inflation was the primary threat to the continued expansion of the economy. By the time of the committee's August meeting, the risks had become balanced, and the committee will need to consider carefully the potential ramifications of ongoing developments since that meeting. . . . 
 When costs rise, the attention of management presumably becomes focused more sharply on investments to limit the effects of rising costs.
But if cost-cutting at will is, in fact, currently available, it suggests that a backlog of unexploited capital projects has been built up in recent years, which, if true, implies the potential for continued gains in productivity close to the elevated rates of the last couple of years. Even if this is indeed the case, and only anecdotal evidence supports it, security analysts' recent projected per share earnings growth of more than 13 percent annually over the next three to five years is unlikely to materialize. It would imply an ever-increasing share of profit in the national income from a level that is already high by historic standards. Such conditions have led in the past to labor market pressures that thwarted further profit growth. . . .
Clearly, the history of large swings in investor confidence and equity premiums for rational and other reasons counsels caution in the current context. We have relearned in recent weeks that just as a bull stock market feels unending and secure as an economy and stock market move forward, so it can feel when markets contract that recovery is inconceivable. Both, of course, are wrong. But because of the difficulty imagining a turnabout when such emotions take hold, periods of euphoria or distress tend to feed on themselves. Indeed, if this were not the case, the types of psychologically driven ebbs and flows of economic activity we have observed would be unlikely to exist. . . .

HEADLINE: BELIEFS

BYLINE: By Peter Steinfels 

 BODY:
Peter L. Berger is a contrarian, no doubt about it. A pre-eminent sociologist of religion, he has been undercutting conventional assumptions since "The Noise of Solemn Assemblies," his 1961 book, cast a cold eye on the postwar religious revival still in full bloom.
His latest salvo is in the current issue of The Christian Century, the journal of liberal Protestantism. Professor Berger, director of the Institute for the Study of Economic Culture at Boston University, began by confessing one big error in his early thinking: that modernity necessarily leads to a decline in religion. 
 Except for a few locales like Western Europe and few highly visible groups, like the humanistically educated intelligentsia, most of the world, he said, is as religious as ever. But he remains convinced that modern pluralism undermined the "taken for grantedness" that has bolstered traditional religious beliefs and moral values.
Pluralism, in sum, may not keep people from believing but it influences how they believe -- namely, with a good deal less certainty. There are, of course, individuals who thrive on this lack of certainty. But most people find it disconcerting, especially when it touches on life's most basic questions. That is why they are drawn to various contemporary "offers of certainty."
He identifies three of long standing within the Christian orbit. One can seek certainty in the institution of the church, in an absolute understanding of the biblical text or in one's own direct religious experience. Catholicism has tended toward the first, fundamentalist Protestantism toward the second, revivalism and Pentecostalism toward the third.
Professor Berger argues that the modern human sciences have weakened all three possibilities. Historical scholarship creates uncertainties about the institution's trustworthiness. Biblical criticism raises doubts about any certain interpretation of the texts. Psychology and the sociology of knowledge undermine confidence in inner experiences.
But is the person who rejects these offers of certainty thrown into the alternative of a relativism that verges on nihilism?
"If one rejects the stark alternatives of an open-ended relativism or some variant of absolutist retrenchment," the professor wrote, "one is faced with a simple but far-reaching question: How is one to have religious beliefs and to lead a religious life in a state of uncertainty?"
His answer draws on classical Protestantism and its core formula: "By faith alone -- sola fide."
Faith is capable of providing what cannot be provided by direct experience, pure logic or the "taken for granted" knowledge that pluralism undermines. But Protestantism does not have a monopoly on this religious posture. "It is a mellow synthesis of skepticism and faith that, in principle, can be found in any religious tradition," Professor Berger wrote.
Of course, words like "faith," "relativism" and "absolutism" are red meat for voracious theologians and philosophers, and many will be tempted to have a tasty meal at Professor Berger's expense. But that may be nothing like the free-for-all his article could provoke among scholars of American religion.
The new reigning wisdom in those circles has been that only "strong religion" is likely to prosper in contemporary America, only religious groups, in other words, that demand substantial commitments of time and resources from their adherents and firm allegiance to beliefs and practices that differentiate the faithful from the surrounding culture.
This view gains support from the growth of conservative Christian groups and from the decline or stagnation of "weak" liberal denominations that more readily tolerate modern uncertainties.
Professor Berger's article is both a sociological and theological challenge to that view, and he even supplies a text from Paul's First Letter to the Corinthians: "God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong." He cites some recent evidence that "weak" religious institutions can be remarkably vital.
But what gives his article force is less the evidence it cites than the changed attitude toward mainline Protestantism that it expresses.
A conservative, Professor Berger has made many biting observations over the years on the political and economic liberalism marking the leadership of mainline Protestant bodies (and of American Catholicism as well), reflective, he said, of a deeper accommodation to the assumptions of modern culture.
"I tended to look on mainline Protestantism as a community very much gone astray," he said yesterday in a telephone conversation, "one terribly vulnerable to fashionable ideas." That view is "still correct," he said. "But it has struck me increasingly that there is a kind of blessing in this."
"This has been a pretty demoralized community," he added. "I'm telling them, Don't be that demoralized." The "era of uncertainty" created by modern pluralism has created believers of a new sort "who may be a majority of the population," he said, "and need ministering."
Jesus may not be found in "the self-assured, triumphalist institutions that merit the appellation of "strong churches,' Professor Berger wrote in his article, but "in those 'weak' places -- where people are unsure of themselves, groping for a few glimpses of truth to hold on to."

HEADLINE: GREENSPAN HINTS THAT A RATE CUT ISN'T UNTHINKABLE

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER with RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 4

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, signaled today that the central bank was now less concerned about inflation as a threat to the American economy and was increasingly wary that the spreading global financial crisis could harm the United States.
Mr. Greenspan's comments seemed to open the door to consideration of an interest rate cut if the global financial situation continued to deteriorate or if the American economy showed signs of stalling. Excerpts, page C2. 
 His comments at the University of California at Berkeley came just minutes before Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin met here with Japan's new Finance Minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, to hammer home the message that the best hope of halting the crisis lay in quick action by Tokyo to stimulate its economy and shore up its financial system.
But with market volatility having spread to Latin America and with Russia veering toward economic collapse, American officials said they feared that it would be increasingly difficult to contain the turmoil.
At the end of a week in which Wall Street experienced a sharp selloff, Mr. Greenspan said that even the United States was increasingly vulnerable. "It is just not credible that the United States can remain an oasis of prosperity unaffected by a world that is experiencing greatly increased stress," he said. The current state of the economy was reflected in today's August employment report, which showed that payrolls grew by 365,000 jobs. Page C1.
Mr. Greenspan stopped well short of saying that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates, a step being urged on him by a growing chorus of economists and officials in other countries. An interest rate reduction in the United States would help reduce borrowing costs around the world and could be a powerful psychological boost to embattled investors at home and abroad.
But Mr. Greenspan's comments were a marked departure from his last major policy statement, in July, when he told Congress that the risks of inflation outweighed the possibility that the global financial turmoil could push the otherwise strong American economy into recession.
The global turmoil that has robbed countries of prosperity and growth has benefited the United States so far by helping to dampen inflation and slow down an economy that was at risk of overheating, Mr. Greenspan said in his speech tonight. The downward pressure on inflation is likely to intensify as the turmoil in other nations mounts, a development that he said led Federal Reserve policy makers to rethink their strategy at their last meeting, on Aug. 18.
"In the spring and early summer, the Federal Open Market Committee was concerned that a rise in inflation was the primary threat to the continued expansion of the economy," he said. "By the time of the committee's August meeting, the risks had become balanced, and the committee will need to consider carefully the potential ramifications of ongoing developments since that meeting."
Mr. Greenspan's wording indicated that the committee had abandoned its formal policy of leaning toward an interest rate increase in favor of a neutral stance that favors neither a rate increase nor a cut. The Fed's next policy meeting is Sept. 29.
Mr. Greenspan went on to suggest that the Fed would not rush into a decision about reducing rates just because of this week's slide in stocks.
"We have relearned in recent weeks that just as a bull stock market feels unending and secure as an economy and stock market move forward, so it can feel when markets contract that recovery is inconceivable," he said. "Both, of course, are wrong. But because of the difficulty imagining a turnabout when such emotions take hold, periods of euphoria or distress tend to feed on themselves."
Mr. Greenspan, who has been warning investors for nearly two years that stock prices were higher than reasonable expectations of earnings growth would justify, did not say whether he thought stocks were now more fairly valued after this week's tumble on Wall Street.
But he said the 13 percent annual growth in earnings projected by analysts "is unlikely to materialize."
Mr. Greenspan joined with Mr. Rubin after his speech in meeting with Mr. Miyazawa. Just two days ago in Moscow, President Clinton termed the meeting with Mr. Miyazawa, who served as Prime Minister for two years until a fracturing of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party in 1993, as "profoundly important." That statement reflected a growing view in the Administration that the best hope of choking off the 14-month-old Asian crisis was to bring about a turnaround in Japan.
But Treasury officials winced at Mr. Clinton's characterization because they feared that Japan was still weeks or months away from decisive action, at a time that markets were fraying around the world.
All the early indications from Tokyo were that Mr. Miyazawa was arriving with few new ideas, no new plans and only vague promises. "This meeting was never designed or intended to address the question of a plan," Mr. Rubin said on a flight to San Francisco today.
The main reason Mr. Rubin and his aides were seeking to play down expectations was their fear that the world's markets could react badly to news of little progress from the meeting. But it is also in part because Mr. Rubin and Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers have relatively little leverage: Their explicit criticisms of Japan in recent months have created a backlash in Tokyo, and the Japanese Parliament is spinning its wheels as the ruling and opposition parties argue over what to do about the insolvency of some of the world's largest banks.
"I don't think we will propose anything new," a senior Japanese official said before the meeting. "It is just that for the first time we have a Finance Minister who can explain what our Government is doing."
The official was referring to Mr. Miyazawa's greatest attribute as an international diplomat: He speaks fluent English, learned during travels in the United States before World War II, and for half a century he has been cast into crises and negotiations with the United States.
But in this case, he has relatively little to work with. Japan's Parliament has been talking for months about passing legislation that would address the country's deepening banking crisis. But the debate has just begun, and it has been bogged down by the question of whether billions of dollars in public funds should be used to bail out banks that now have upward of a trillion dollars in bad loans on their books.

Pakistan Accused of Coercion
The former lawyer for a defendant charged in the bombing of the United States Embassy in Kenya said that his client was told, while under interrogation in Pakistan, that the Government there wanted his confession in order to improve relations with the United States, which had been damaged by Pakistan's test of nuclear weapons in May. A4
 
Oil Prices Hurt Aid Program
Recent sharp drops in the price of oil have undermined a program under which Iraq can sell its oil to raise money for urgent civilian needs like food and medicine, the senior official in charge of the program told the Security Council. The official said the reduced earnings from oil sales would mean that the United Nations could not meet a higher nutritional target in food supplied to Iraqis. A5
 
North Korea Defends Launching
North Korea said the purpose of its launching of a multistage rocket on Monday was to carry a satellite into orbit, not to test a missile. It denounced Japan and other countries for concluding that it was launching a new class of missile. A5

Clinton Accepts Criticism Of Conduct With Lewinsky
President Clinton, forced again on his five-day foreign trip to confront questions about the Lewinsky matter, said he "basically" agreed with Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, who criticized the President's conduct as "immoral" and "disgraceful." Mr. Clinton, speaking in Ireland, said he was "very sorry about" his relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky, describing it as "indefensible." A1
 
Congressional Democrats began falling in line behind Senator Lieberman, but Democrats elsewhere stopped short of calling for Mr. Clinton to resign or be impeached. A8
 
Representative Dan Burton, who is leading an inquiry into President Clinton's campaign finances, admitted he had an extramarital relationship in the 1980's and had fathered a child, The Indianapolis Star said. A9
 
Boys' Murder Charges Dropped
Prosecutors in Chicago dropped murder charges against two boys, ages 7 and 8, who had been accused of killing an 11-year-old girl. A laboratory analysis found semen in the girl's underpants, and prosecutors said medical experts believed that the possibility of the semen coming from boys so young was remote. A1

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Analysts Warn of Dangers to Brazil's Economy

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Sept. 4

 BODY:
With Brazil's stock market in a nose dive and the Central Bank spending $1 billion a day to defend the currency, economists warned that despite the strengths of Brazil's economy, investor panic could plunge the region into decline.
Brazil's market fell by 5.8 percent today, following a decline of 8.61 percent on Thursday, its second worst in history, touched off, in part, by a downgrading of Brazilian bonds and notes by Moody's Investor Service. The markets were not soothed by an televised appeal by President Fernando Henrique Cardoso on Thursday night for a "national pact for fiscal adjustment" or by criticism of the Moody's assessment by Brazilian officials. 
 To the contrary, stocks plunged further today as a low-ranking United States Treasury official called the Brazilian currency "unarguably overvalued." The Treasury later disavowed the comments as a personal opinion not reflecting the department's policy.
Investors worldwide have been fleeing emerging markets, and Brazil has been caught in the crosscurrents. In the month of August alone, Brazilian equities fell 40 percent, with similar losses in stock exchanges around the continent.
Brazil's current account deficit hovers at nearly 4 percent of gross domestic product. The country's failure to cut Government operating expenses, particularly Civil Service costs, has put the country in a difficult position as credit tightens for emerging markets around the globe.
Citing these structural weaknesses, Moody's downgraded its rating of Brazilian bonds and notes to B2 from B1 and the ceiling for foreign currency bank deposits to Caa1. It also downgraded three Brazilian banks to C from C+.
The Brazilian Finance Minister, Pedro Malan, in Washington for a meeting of Latin finance ministers with the International Monetary Fund that ended today, lashed out at Moody's analysts, saying they were compensating for earlier optimistic ratings in Asia by turning more cautious toward Latin America.
Michel Camdessus, managing director of the fund, said that many of the problems faced by Brazil and Latin countries derived from panic elsewhere in the world rather than lack of will to take tough economic measures.
But with markets throughout the region plummeting, Mr. Camdessus acknowledged that the situation for Latin America was "dangerous." He said that "a degree of panic" among investors had led to "an excessive and unfortunate pressure" on many countries in Latin America. "It's true that if this persists, a number of countries will have to tighten their policies," Mr. Camdessus said, hurting their growth prospects.
In his speech Thursday night, Mr. Cardoso, who is favored to win re-election Oct. 4, did not announce any new initiatives. His talk restated his Government's commitment to Civil Service, social security and tax reforms that stalled during his first term. "We have to continue a program of fiscal adjustment," he said.
With roughly $58 billion in foreign reserves, Brazil has substantial resources to stabilize its currency. Under Mr. Cardoso, it has made headway toward market-oriented reforms, privatizing state industries and slaying chronic hyperinflation.
Analysts say the Central Bank has been spending an average of $1.3 billion a day since Sept. 1 to protect the Brazilian currency, the real, while today's O Globo newspaper reported international reserves had fallen $15.8 billion since Aug. 1. A spokesman for the Central Bank, usually forthcoming with information, would not confirm the figures or provide others.
Mr. Malan has ruled out a devaluation, but Brazilians are buying dollars to cover themselves. The difference between the official and informal rates of exchange has been widening, with exchange houses offering 1.27 reais against the dollar, compared with an official rate of 1.17 reais.
Under Mercosur, the southern cone customs union joining Brazil with Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, Argentina's exports to Brazil quadrupled, and now represent more than 25 percent of its export business. With Argentina's peso pegged to dollar reserves, a devaluation in Brazil would send instant tremors through Buenos Aires. "Safely and securely, they would be in a deep crisis," said Alexandre Barros, a Brasilia-based political consultant.
Paulo Leme, economic research director of emerging markets at Goldman, Sachs, argues that industrial nations must come up with solutions, such as a lowering of United States interest rates, replenishing the International Monetary Fund's bailout capacity and restoring stability to Japan, to help emerging markets. "These are not isolated viral cases, but an epidemic," he said.
Brazilian companies are carrying a foreign debt of $108.5 billion, up from $37.3 billion three years ago. Some $11 billion will come due before next July, and if international lenders decline to renew the loans, the companies will turn to the Central Bank.
One emerging-markets specialist, who requested anonymity, said that while investment analysts picked over the differences between developing markets, investors these days acted on the similarities. Underpinning the rage for emerging markets were assumptions -- that currencies do not devalue, that countries do not default -- that have been shattered with Russia's collapse.
"The real contagion is not something I'm worried about, it's the financial contagion," the analyst said. "Everybody agrees that if the Hong Kong peg were to go, the attack on Brazil would be relentless, until there were no international reserves left."
"It's not because there's a real connection between the economies," he added. "It has everything to do with perceptions, and the psychosis of the market."
Perhaps for that reason, a letter to the editor of The Wall Street Journal from the lower-level Treasury Department official was quickly disavowed. The official, Britta Hillstrom, wrote that while "Brazil's real is unarguably overvalued, a destructive devaluation is not the only solution," and said the country could move the exchange rate band. A spokeswoman for the Treasury Department said those "were absolutely not the views of the Treasury Department."

HEADLINE: 6 Children Found Strangled After Mother Confesses to 911

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: ST. PAUL, Sept. 4

 BODY:
A mother of six, living in poverty and estranged from her husband, called 911 on Thursday night, the police said, and made a shocking statement: she had killed her children.
Police officers and paramedics rushed to her apartment and found the bodies of three girls and three boys, ages 5 to 11. The woman, Khoua Her, 24, was lying inside the doorway wearing a fancy red dress. The body of one of the children was behind her. 
 The woman was in custody at Region's Hospital here. The medical examiner's office said the children had been strangled.
In the call to 911, the woman had spoken about suicide. But it was unclear whether she had harmed herself.
As a 13-year-old girl, Khoua Her was paired with her husband in an arranged marriage in her native Laos, neighbors said. When her babies started to arrive, they came almost every year, six of them altogether.
Minnesota is a center for the Hmong, refugees from Laos who have long struggled economically. But the police and civic officials were careful to play down any notion that such a horrific event had any cultural underpinnings.
The police had been called to the apartment at least 15 times in the last 18 months for domestic turbulence.
Calling the deaths "very, very tragic," Chief William Finney of the St. Paul Police said: "We see this across cultures. It doesn't matter what culture you're from, American or otherwise."
The family lived in a two-story housing project, which is racially and ethnically mixed.
This afternoon, there was a hush and a somberness among adults and children who could not quite believe what had happened.
Not long after the deaths, more than 150 people gathered outside Thursday night. A voice called out for respect, pleading, "Can we get a moment of silence for these six angels that's gone?" The Star Tribune reported.
In recent months the woman's husband, Tou Hang, had left the apartment, and she had been dating another man, neighbors said. One neighbor said she saw Ms. Her "scoop up the kids" and chase them inside when he came to call recently.
Chief Finney acknowledged the many police visits to the apartment for domestic violence, but said, "There was never any indication the children were in this kind of danger." Police records show at least eight calls to the apartment since January.
Mai Xiong, a friend of the woman's new boyfriend, told reporters that the mother loved her children, but that she had regretted marrying to young.
The friend she Ms. Her was "depressed over the amount of responsibility she had."
She told The Star Tribune: "She basically missed out on all her teen-age years. She wanted to have fun." She added, "I always thought of her as kind of odd, but I didn't think this would ever happen."
A neighbor, Christopher Yang, said the parents had taken turns taking care of the children. He described the mother as "someone who was not really taking care of her kids," saying that she would sometimes leave the apartment without taking them.
The children were scheduled to return to school next week.
Minnesota has long been a center of resettlement for refugees, largely because of the work of Lutheran Social Services and other religious organizations. Thousands of refugees from Somalia have settled in Minneapolis in recent years.
The Hmong have had a difficult time in America. Most are poor and illiterate, and street gangs have been growing among their young people. Arranged marriages are common in the Hmong culture. In general, the Hmong people do not mix very much among other cultures.
Neighbors said the family had lived in St. Paul for several years.
Mayor Norm Coleman of St. Paul described the deaths as "a tragedy of overwhelming proportion," adding, "We're all shaken, the community is shaken."
The police identified the dead children as Kouaeai Hang, 11; Samson Hang, 9; Nali Hang, 9; Tang Lung Hang, 7; Aee Hang, 6; and Tang Ke Hang, 5.
The apartment building was roped off with yellow police tape today, and few of the children played in the playgrounds.
"There's usually a lot of kids playing," said Sade Kelly, 12. "Now it's kind of empty."

HEADLINE: Clinton Says He Is 'Very Sorry' After Senator's Harsh Criticism

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: DUBLIN, Sept. 4

 BODY:
Forced again on this five-day foreign trip to confront questions about the Lewinsky scandal, President Clinton said today that he "basically" agreed with Senator Joseph I. Lieberman who on Thursday criticized the President's conduct as "immoral" and "disgraceful."
And for the first time, Mr. Clinton said he was "very sorry about" his relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky, describing it as "indefensible." 
 In a picture-taking session this morning with the Prime Minister of Ireland, Bertie Ahern, Mr. Clinton was asked about Mr. Lieberman's remarks on the floor of the Senate.
"I've been briefed on them and basically I agree with what he said," Mr. Clinton said.
He was clearly prepared for the questions and his manner displayed no suggestion of unease or defensiveness, standing casually with his hands clasped behind his back as Prime Minister Ahern looked on.
"I've already said that I made a bad mistake, it was indefensible and I'm sorry about it. So I have nothing else to say except that I can't disagree with anyone else who wants to be critical of what I have already acknowledged was indefensible."
Pressed by reporters, Mr. Clinton added, "There's nothing that he or anyone else could say in a personally critical way that I -- that I don't imagine that I would disagree with, since I have already said it myself, to myself. And I'm very sorry about it. There's nothing else I could say."
In Washington today, Senator Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat, said he appreciated Mr. Clinton's apology, but added that the President would have to say more. "It doesn't end with a single statement," Mr. Lieberman said. Page A8
Aides said after the President spoke that his remarks were part of a deliberate effort to convey remorse and to placate critics who say that Mr. Clinton has not sufficiently apologized for his actions. The critics, many of them in the President's own party, have said Mr. Clinton has inflamed the crisis by continuing to attack Kenneth W. Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel whose investigation exposed the Lewinsky relationship and Mr. Clinton's lies about it. Mr. Clinton made no reference today to the investigation that threatens his Presidency.
Mr. Lieberman suggested on Thursday that Mr. Clinton's transgressions were so severe that the Senate might feel compelled to formally condemn them in a vote of censure or other official action.
Mr. Clinton responded, "I just don't want to comment on that. I shouldn't be commenting on that while I'm on this trip, and I don't think that, my understanding is that was not a decision that was made or advocated clearly yesterday."
He added, "If that's not an issue, I don't want to make it one, one way or the other. I don't think that's appropriate right now."
For the second time on this trip to Russia and Ireland, Mr. Clinton's comments on the Lewinsky matter overshadowed the scripted message of the day, which today was supposed to be on progress toward peace in Northern Ireland and prospects for economic growth in the Republic of Ireland.
On Wednesday, Mr. Clinton faced questions on the affair in a Kremlin news conference with Boris N. Yeltsin, the besieged President of Russia. On that occasion, Mr. Clinton said he believed he had already expressed his "profound regret to all who were hurt" by the Lewinsky scandal.
Aides said Mr. Clinton knew he would confront the issue again today after Mr. Lieberman's statement. Erskine B. Bowles, the White House chief of staff, tried to persuade Mr. Lieberman to delay his remarks until after Mr. Clinton returned to Washington on Saturday night, but Mr. Lieberman declined, said Michael D. McCurry, the White House press secretary.
Mr. Clinton spoke to Mr. Lieberman about the Senator's concerns before he left Washington, but he, too, failed to persuade Mr. Lieberman to withhold public judgment, Mr. McCurry said. Mr. Clinton, the aides said, chose his words carefully today as part of a strategy to apologize for his actions, without offering any fuller explanation for them.
Mr. Clinton went to bed on Thursday night unaware of Mr. Lieberman's comments, Mr. McCurry said. The President was informed of the statement this morning, and he discussed possible responses with Mr. Bowles and other senior advisers.
"He made very clear how he wanted to respond, and that's what he did," Mr. McCurry said. He added that there was no special significance to the President's saying he was "sorry" twice in his responses this morning.
"He believes that that's what he's been saying all along," Mr. McCurry said. "Saying you're sorry means you're sorry."
But the President knows that his further statement of regret will not put the matter to rest, Mr. McCurry added. "He's got a very realistic outlook" on Mr. Starr's investigation, the continuing debate in Congress and among the public about the Lewinsky relationship, and the certainty that he will continue to face media questions about this issue at every turn.
Mr. McCurry said the President had been calling Democratic leaders and other supporters in hopes of preventing further desertions like Mr. Lieberman's. But the job of repairing the breach with members of his party, and the public, will not be easy and will not be accomplished quickly, Mr. McCurry acknowledged.
"I think the President clearly does not believe that one conversation, one statement, one speech, is going to be sufficient in addressing this matter the way he wants to, and he intends to keep addressing it both personally and, to the degree he needs to, publicly, as he sees fit," Mr. McCurry said.
But there is, for now, no firm plan for how the President intends to try to put the Lewinsky matter to rest. The President is trying to find an escape from the credibility crisis he generated by his own actions and false statements, Mr. McCurry said.
"This is such an intensely personal thing, and the President is deciding for himself how to address these matters," Mr. McCurry said. "And so there can't be any concrete plan that I'm aware of because the President is taking it one day at a time."
Mr. McCurry said there had been no discussion "whatsoever" among Mr. Clinton and his advisers about the President's resignation.
The President said in April that he would "never" resign. Asked if Mr. Clinton had reconsidered in light of recent revelations, Mr. McCurry replied, "I am confident his attitude has not changed on that."

HEADLINE: A Tradition Remade in Brooklyn;
West Indians Prepare a Lavish, and Popular, Pageant

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA and GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE 

 BODY:
A Brooklyn block lined with auto repair shops becomes an open-air rehearsal studio for three competing orchestras. As dusk falls on Parkside Avenue, quick, trained hands strike rows upon rows of carefully tuned oil barrels, mallets are beat on rusty tire irons, and the warm summer nights fill up with the syncopated sounds of calypso.
In the one corner of a shop where the roof has not yet collapsed from rain, a man who makes his living as a security guard constructs tall, baroque costumes out of cardboard and peacock feathers. Nearby, teen-agers brought up on basketball and Biggie Smalls spend the evening mastering the steel-band songs of their Caribbean parents. 
 A New World tradition is being remade once more in New York: the Caribbean heart of Brooklyn is getting ready for its annual late-summer Carnival, the city's biggest, most extravagant parade.
On Monday morning, in the 31st annual West Indian American Day Carnival along Eastern Parkway from Utica Avenue to Grand Army Plaza, schoolteachers and nannies will shed their workday clothes for skimpy thongs and dreamy costumes. The grandchildren of migrants from the American South will play steel drum with the children of Trinidadian immigrants. In a distinctly Brooklyn mix, Haitian rara bands with their goatskin drums will file among the tassa drummers, and mammoth trucks will roll down the Parkway, blasting soca and reggae.
What began as a small, homespun celebration in Harlem in the 1930's has grown into a pageant surpassing older, better-known processions like the St. Patrick's Day or the Puerto Rican Day parades -- a reflection of the surging immigration from the islands. Today, New York City is home to an estimated 600,000 Caribbean-Americans, the bulk of them in Brooklyn.
But the growth of the parade, and its dozens of attendant parties, concerts and competitions, is more than a testament to rising Caribbean immigration. It is also a reflection of how many Caribbean immigrants who ignored, even snubbed, the rites of Carnival in Trinidad or Grenada have embraced it here, both as a way to recall the home they left behind and to keep their children in the Caribbean fold.
Brooklyn's West Indian parade draws an estimated two million people, in comparison with the million or so who come out for the Thanksgiving Day Parade in Manhattan. The city's Convention and Visitors Bureau now includes it on its list of Labor Day weekend attractions, and New Yorkers with no ties to the islands come to watch and, increasingly, to don costumes in the masquerade bands, to play "mas" as it is called.
In a nod to the political power of Caribbean New Yorkers, the parade has become a mandatory campaign stop. Banners pitching beer and long-distance telephone service now stretch along the parade route. And for the last three years, the parade has been broadcast live on local television, this year on WNBC, with a kind of cultural play-by-play by one of Trinidad's most prominent masquerade designers, Peter Minshall.
The evolution of the parade also speaks volumes for how old-country rituals are reinvented, Brooklyn-style.
Yvonne Barnes, 60, a transplanted Trinidadian whose children and grandchildren now join her on Eastern Parkway, likened the Brooklyn parade to a tasty fruit-flavored drink. "With the grapyness," was how she put it, "but not the grape."
Indeed, carnival scholars and revelers say, the Brooklyn parade is in many ways a different kind of concoction altogether. For one thing, it is an American-style march, not a series of free-floating processions as in Port of Spain, the capital of Trinidad and Tobago, where this Carnival was born. To accommodate television, the parade here must stick to a schedule, and marshals must keep dancers from veering off the route.
"Oh, they used to be extremely careless about scheduling," recalled Major R. Owens, the United States Representative from Crown Heights who made his first appearance at the parade 18 years ago. "It was supposed to start at 11 o'clock, and it wouldn't start till 1."
Since then, considerable effort has been made to bring the parade in line with a tighter schedule, install portable toilets and police barricades, and garner corporate donations.
But the growth of the parade has also sown dissension between the organizers and some of the band leaders, particularly over how to pay for this phenomenally expensive affair. The West Indian Day Carnival Association, the organizer, says the weekend-long bacchanal now costs nearly a half-million dollars; for some of the bigger masquerade bands, like the 1,000-member Hawks International, the costumes and sound equipment necessary for a few hours on the Parkway cost $50,0O0. This year, organizers expect 30 such bands.
While the city does not estimate the parade's economic impact, there are a few budding efforts to use the Carnival as an engine of economic development. Una Clarke, the City Councilwoman from Crown Heights, for instance, has proposed a program to generate year-round jobs for the Carnival costume-makers. Mr. Owens is seeking to build a Caribbean-American cultural museum with an office for parade organizers.
Corporations with an interest in the Caribbean-American market have begun to capitalize on the parade, with companies like Western Union, AT&T and Mobil sponsoring some of the larger masquerade bands as well as the parade itself. "It's relevant to our target audience, and we want to be part of it," said Anthony Smith, the Mobil Corporation's manager for diversity marketing and community relations.
The parade has also fueled the resurgence of another Trinidadian rite. For the last several years, Trinidadians hankering for less structure and more steel bands have turned to a free-spirited predawn pageant called J'ouvert, which since slavery times has been a venue for drums, dance and social commentary.
In Brooklyn, J'ouvert -- a French-derived term pronounced joo-VAY and loosely translated as "I open," as in the opening of Carnival -- has grown by leaps and bounds in the last few years. It now draws about 50,000 people to a parking lot behind the Brooklyn Museum, but so far, no politicians. Amplified music is barred, leaving only the peals of the steel pan to break the cool silence of the night.
For J'ouvert this year, Tricia Mayhew and her friends will slather themselves from head to toe with red paint and dance under the stars. Ms. Mayhew, a 27-year-old high school science teacher, has joined the parade on the Parkway ever since she left Trinidad, 11 years ago. But she has not played J'ouvert like this since she was a child.
"Catching all those faces and listening to the steel bands, you get that original feeling," she said. "We've gotten so commercialized now. But to watch these musicians play these notes, you just marvel. You feel a sense of more freedom."
If the growth of Carnival is a function of a conventional immigrant narrative -- doing in this country what one did at home -- the opposite is also true. Many have delved into the rites of Carnival only after leaving home.
As a Catholic school student in Trinidad, Kathy Clarke was allowed only a glimpse of the masquerading revelers at Carnival time. She never covered herself in paint on J'ouvert morning. And she would never have been caught in the neighborhood pan yard, whiling away her evenings with the pan men -- and it once was only men -- who were considered "hooligans," she said.
Now, both her college-age son and daughter play steel drum. And Ms. Clarke, a middle school teacher from East Flatbush who moved to New York in 1979, serves as sort of a den mother for their band, the Invaders. She joins her children as they play pan on J'ouvert morning and then rushes home to change into costume for the parade.
"People tell me this -- you're lucky you can keep kids in the culture," she said the other day, as her daughter, Dominique, 20, practiced on a six-headed bass drum in the backyard of an East Flatbush preschool.
If parents look to steel band as a way to keep their children "in the culture," the music now also fills a void in neighborhoods where sports, arts and other recreational programs for young people have all but dried up.
On a recent Sunday evening, the pan yard of the Sesame Flyers steel band in Flatbush was bustling. Bass drums were spray-painted gold. The chrome tenor drums were rubbed until they shone. Later in the evening, they would play on Church Avenue, and people would pour out of their hot apartments to stroll and listen.
Teen-agers now form the core of many bands in Brooklyn. Roots-seeking may be important to their parents, but the young people are drawn to the pan yard by other things. They come so they can stay out with friends long past their curfew. They come because they feel safe, because the pan yard, they say, is like family. Mostly, they come for the music.
Anthony (Mike) Patten, the captain of the Sesame Flyers, remembered when the steel pan first pulled him in. Even though his father played pan as a young man in Belize, Mr. Patten discovered it only serendipitously. He was a sophomore in high school back then, and he was giving rides to a neighbor who played pan at a youth center on Flatbush Avenue. "The energy was amazing," he said, his eyes lighting up at the memory. "It was kind of infectious."
It was infectious enough to bring Mr. Patten, now 25, back to Brooklyn after college in Connecticut. It is also apparently infectious enough to draw teen-agers to the pan yard every night of the week, until well past midnight, all summer long -- and to give up every Friday and Saturday night during the school year as well.
Kelvin Browne, 16, has been playing for nearly seven years, often riding the bus for a half-hour each way to get his hands on a tenor drum.
"Something got stuck on me," he said. "Having something to play, having fun, hanging out. In the end, it's worth it."

LASSO THE WIND
Away to the New West.
 By Timothy Egan.
 266 pp. New York:
 Alfred A. Knopf. $25. 
 "In my book a pioneer is a man who turned all the grass upside down, strung bob-wire over the dust that was left, poisoned the water, cut down the trees, killed the Indian who owned the land and called it progress." Timothy Egan is quoting a surprising source, the celebrated cowboy artist Charles Russell. But he could as easily be quoting himself. In "Lasso the Wind," Egan, a national correspondent for The New York Times, alternately comes on as a Jeremiah with notebook and running shoes, and the Peck's Bad Boy of the New West. "I'm in Big Timber, breakfasting at the Road Kill Cafe," he writes, after pridefully describing the "nosebleed" section of the high Rockies as "one of the few places left in the world where bears still eat people, semiregularly."
Egan grew up in Washington State. In an earlier book, "The Good Rain," he wrote eloquently about what has been done to salmon, Indians and the environment in the Pacific Northwest. Now, on a larger canvas, he rages against big ranchers, mine owners, dam builders, real estate moguls, timbermen and, of course, the dead-hand grip still exerted by the Legend of the Old West, which he sees as a "pitiful excuse for a history," a brief, shameful period (1846-90) driven by greed, lawlessness and attempted genocide.
Environmentalists and revisionist historians have been making similar points for quite a while; often, it seems, because however ghastly the past may have been, the historians wanted us to know that women, blacks and Indians played their part. Initially, "Lasso the Wind" promises more: a kind of reflective reportorial tour of the 11 states "on the sunset side of the 100th meridian," in which Egan manages to come to tentative conclusions about the elusive New West. He makes 14 stops, two each in Arizona, Montana, New Mexico and Utah, one in Nevada, Colorado, Idaho, Oregon, Washington and (last) California, a place where, he writes in Delphic mode, "it is a quick ride from the Geography of Hope to the cliff of fear."
Effete Easterners will possibly want to fly out West, rent a car and follow in Egan's footsteps as he describes zinging around in the wide open spaces. Drop in, as he does, on a local hero of the Sagebrush Rebellion in Catron County, N.M. (Catron is one of several places where ranchers claim that the Government has no right to charge them for grazing cattle on public land, even though the fees they pay are so low as to amount to what Egan, with much company, regards as a Federal subsidy of a dying industry). Move north to Lake Havasu City, Ariz., where London Bridge, transported stone by stone, was reassembled in the midst of an ersatz English village. Head on up to that water-guzzling urban monstrosity, Las Vegas, as the Sands Hotel (the iniquitous landmark of many a Sinatra-struck youth) is blown sky high by ambitious developers. Hike with him in the burning rock country of southern Utah as he looks for petroglyphs. Egan is a connoisseur of rock drawings, and a man wild about wilderness. When he finds a splendid glyph covered by wire mesh to protect it from possible vandalism, he is deeply cast down. "No longer wild," he writes, "it was as if it had been put in a zoo."
Any reader of "The Good Rain" will recognize here Egan's nimble skipping between past and present, his high-powered invocations of natural scenery, his easy grip on the geography of hills and rivers, as well as a talent for writing in provocative sound bites. It is soon clear that a good deal of the book will be less a journal of inquiry than a didactic tour. He wants us to understand that the upstart West does too have an ancient history. A section somewhat brassily labeled "Plymouth Rock West" gets into Coronado's armed incursion into New Mexico in the 1540's, then Don Juan de Onate's savage assault in 1598 on the ancient Indian hill town of Acoma, which Egan describes as the "first battle over religious freedom in what is now the United States."
Soon he is off to fast-growing Douglas County, outside Denver, where the optimistic Ken Turnbull hopes to turn ostrich steak into America's preferred protein. The creatures weigh 340 pounds, run 40 miles an hour, are cheap to feed and can kick a coyote to death. Egan lightens up a bit, imagining a past in which John Wayne et al. try to herd these unherdable birds. But comic relief is not in sight. For, in addition to low-life cowboys, 19th-century railroad barons, merciless copper-mining kings and powerful cattlemen then and now, Egan has it in for the cow itself. An alien creature that was imported from England after the longhorn cattle died out, the cow, he insists, has ruined the rivers, overgrazed and stomped bare the once-green ranges of the West.
Egan does not make the argument of the reformist author Jeremy Rifkin. In "Beyond Beef: The Rise and Fall of Cattle Culture," Rifkin insisted that raising cattle to eat not only bids fair to destroy the South American rain forest but is also bringing starvation to many parts of the world because it is a much less efficient use of land (in terms of feeding people) than growing grain. Egan's grudge against cows seems more personal, and deeper, than such standard environmentalist complaints. He apparently wants them banished -- to be replaced not by ostrich but by bison (read: buffaloburgers), once wantonly destroyed and now making a mild comeback with help from Ted Turner and a few Indian tribes. "Unlike cattle," Egan writes, "bison know how to drink from a stream without destroying it; their hooves are thin, and they don't lie around in . . . mudflats, aswarm with flies, waiting to be herded off to the next meal."
Worse than cattle, as he sees it, is the West's continued misuse of water. Instead of "following the plow," as the creators of various Homestead Acts officially hoped it would, water mostly "flows uphill to money." The result is dams on every Western river except the Yellowstone. Seven states have water rights in the mighty Colorado. The United States, in fact, has more than 75,000 dams. When it comes to curtailing the flow of Western rivers, Egan works in the shadow of Edward Abbey, who in his novel "The Monkey Wrench Gang" created a lively crew bent on blowing up the 710-foot-high Glen Canyon Dam. In Egan's view dams deform nature's rivers, drown great scenery, destroy ancient Indian relics and play hob with wilderness, wildlife -- especially migrating salmon -- and the ecosystem in general. And for what? Often, Egan insists, not to make the desert bloom for the deserving small homesteaders but to further line the pockets of the undeserving rich, among them land speculators who create unsustainably huge, air-conditioned cities -- Phoenix in particular -- in unlivably dry and hot places.
Western water is still allocated to a remarkable degree by what Egan memorably calls the "hydro-extension of gold-fever grubstaking," or the doctrine of "first in time, first in line," meaning that if, historically, you had first crack at a river's water you always have considerable say in its use. Distribution rights have been modified, but not enough, and in the past have set states at virtual war with one another. As Egan notes, quoting Mark Twain, "Whisky is for drinking, water is for fighting over." He predicts that unsustainable Las Vegas, which squanders millions of gallons from great artesian wells that belong to the Paiute Indians and siphons more and more from Lake Mead, will end up having to be protected by the National Guard. In 100 years it will be gone, he says. In 500 years "archeologists will be puzzling over the site of the Sands."
About the misuse, unfairness and chicanery involved in distribution of Western water rights past and present, few will disagree. How to fix the problem will involve more than ironic cries of outrage. Water involves a struggle for a crucial, limited resource, as well as a quasi-religious war between those who hold the earth holy and those who don't -- at present the vast majority of a huge population whose very existence is a greater threat to the environment than the bad guys in black hats Egan constantly blames. Implicitly, he seems to be an old-fashioned populist who can hardly imagine that once freed from the evil grip of greedy special interests "the people" might side against him.
Egan takes a measure of cheer from the fact that just in the last several years a few dams have been scheduled for demolition, while others are under (often acrimonious) discussion. His book would have profited, I think, from examining a few more dam cases and looking closely at who actually uses the power America's dams generate -- an estimated 10 percent of the country's total electricity, and 90 percent of our renewable energy.
"Lasso the Wind" is at its most attractive, and least polemical, toward the end, when Egan gets back on his home turf. In the Northwest, he really knows the people, and shows affection for them -- even when they disagree with him. In Joseph, Ore. (named for the remarkable Nez Perce chief), he finds an angry crowd: frustrated ranchers and timber men, along with large numbers of the local unemployed, are protesting the Endangered Species Act and a plan to make Hells Canyon into a national park. Everyday people "know the New West is inevitable," Egan writes. "They just don't know what their role will be in it." What they don't want is "to become bit players in a new economy, flipping buffaloburgers for mountain bikers from the city." Still, his advice is essentially to forget the old and, as he sees it, doomed economy of cattle, timber and mining, and go along with the New West flow, forsaking angry caricatures like "yuppie scum."
Moving even closer to home, he finds his vision of a peaceable and prosperous future. Sunnyside, Wash., he says, is a place where "much of the West" is headed. Sunnyside is awash in Hispanic immigrants, new and old, already almost 65 percent of the population. In the West "entire valleys, counties, cities have, almost overnight, become majority Latino," with more to come. What Egan has in mind is nothing less than a regional multicultural melting pot, with Latinos enriching the customs and language of the United States but becoming old-fashioned Americans at the same time, as they are now doing locally in many parts of the country. Indians at last will be somewhat integrated into local society, and everyone will do O.K. with espresso bars, heritage tourist centers, rodeos, art and music shops, microbrew and jazz festivals and stores that sell both snakeskin cowboy boots and Mexican guitars.
It is a warmhearted vision, though not entirely compelling, even if you factor in, as he rarely seems to, all sorts of high-tech projects now sprouting in the New West. This is, after all, an age in which we are constantly reminded that the melting pot no longer works. Many minority groups come equipped with lawyers dedicated to divisive self-interest. And since Egan himself invokes the centuries-long presence of Latinos in the West, it may be fair to note that, for whatever reason, most Hispanic countries of the New World have yet to show a real gift for stable parliamentary democracy.
The one convincingly upbeat moment in this heartfelt jeremiad of a book comes, appropriately enough, not from the works of man but from the resilience of nature. In his final chapter, Egan is floating down a stretch of California's American River, where gold was found in 1848, setting off what he sees as the plundering of the West in the name of greed and commerce. Reckless mining and sluicing totally ruined the river. After looking at late-19th-century pictures of it, Egan writes, "Kuwait after it was torched and bombed in the gulf war may have looked better." But the river refused to die, and now it is beautiful and tranquil, clean and full of wildlife. Why? Because it has been left entirely alone.

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT;
In Chinatown, Preserving The Past or the Present?

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
MOST visitors to this city's teeming, colorful Chinatown would probably never notice Hang Ah Alley. A concrete corridor between a restaurant and a playground, it looks like nothing more than a broad, tidy sidewalk, spruced up with a few adolescent trees and several new wooden benches.
But those trees and benches, along with several informational legends carved into the immaculately polished pavement, signal the recently completed renovation of the passageway, the first of 31 alleys in Chinatown scheduled to get face lifts over the next few years with $2.9 million of city money. 
 The campaign to make over the alleys reflects the constant efforts, marked by enduring angst, to keep Chinatown, San Francisco's second most popular tourist destination, at once authentic and accessible, historic and modern, redolent of tradition without being petrified in the past.
Over the last two decades, Chinatown has changed slowly but surely, in small increments that have yielded big results. Its architecture and adornments have in many ways grown less flamboyantly distinctive -- the golden, curled eaves on the corners of buildings less prominent, the individualized woodwork and tile patterns on the facades of many stores less common.
Plastic, glass, economy and efficiency have challenged, if not quite usurped, showmanship. And relentless tourism has wrought the same effect on Chinatown that it has on Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco's most popular destination for visitors, which lies just a few miles away.
In both places, what began as a working neighborhood devoted to a particular enterprise or ethnicity has been homogenized, at least in part, into an all-purpose visitors' bazaar, rife with T-shirts and trinkets.
"It's just all mumble-jumbled," said Enid Lim, a longtime resident. "The food markets have moved to the fringes, and the merchandise that the shops in the center are selling is schlocky."
Ms. Lim belongs to the Chinatown Community Development Center, a group trying to steer the future of Chinatown in a direction that respects its past. The alleys are one of the group's projects, and they represent the nexis of historic preservation and contemporary adaptation.
On the one hand, the alley project is designed to restore to use a network of commercial passageways, lined by tiny shops with doors but no display windows, that were traditionally as vital to many Chinatown residents as the major avenues.
On the other hand, the project gives a nod to the interests of tourists, festooning the alleys with historical lessons.
"Hang Ah means fragrant in Chinese," explains the carved letters on one of a series of legends that a person walks over while traversing Hang Ah Alley. The alley got this name, the legend explains, "when a German chemist opened a perfumery."
But while the alley renovation has been greeted with almost unanimous approval, other bids at historic preservation have not always been so popular. For example, attempts over the last two decades to have Chinatown declared a historic district failed, in large part because many merchants, property owners and developers worried about building restrictions and other rules that would impede profitability.
That opposition shone a light on an ongoing tension in Chinatown: Is it best servedby letting it adapt to market forces, the way other neighborhoods do -- or by conserving its more individual characteristics?
Philip Choy, another longtime Chinatown resident, said that too much conservation was an impediment, an insult of sorts.
"It's like saying we're people in this little artificial zoo for visitors to see," Mr. Choy said. He added that he used the word artificial because what is commonly perceived as traditionally Chinese about Chinatown's architecture is, in fact, an invention to please outsiders. "It was never really Chinese in the first place," he said. "It was pseudo-Chinese."
Indeed, Mr. Choy and other historians of Chinatown noted that most of the brightly lighted pagodas and fancifully detailed buildings were constructed after the 1906 earthquake, in a calculated attempt by Chinese residents to stave off city officials' plans to move them out of the city center. The idea was to create a neighborhood so appealing and idiosyncratic that no one would want to dismantle it.
But time, tourism and soaring real estate values around San Francisco's Financial District, which threatens to encroach on Chinatown, have done some of what city officials at the turn of the century could not. In a few cases, small stores have ceded their lots to office towers; in other cases, the Chinese stationery store with its ornate bronze door, or the Chinese grocer with his pungent, savory offerings, has been replaced by the glass-walled electronics shop.
Those changes sit uneasily with many of the estimated 15,000 residents of Chinatown, about 85 percent of whom are Chinese. "Chinatown is not just for tourists," said Rose Pak, a consultant to the Chinese Chamber of Commerce. "It's still for living. The question is how can we maintain the character and integrity of Chinatown while keeping it functional?"

HEADLINE: FRUGAL TRAVELER;
In Minnesota, Due North

BYLINE: By DAISANN McLANE; DAISANN McLANE writes about music and culture.

 BODY:
THE urge to strap on 10 pounds of gear and walk boldly through thickets of pine trees and mosquitoes is not something that often overcomes this suburban- and city-bred traveler. But in late summer the New York air coagulated into a steamy soup, and a wilder landscape began insisting its way into my daydreams: a steep trail marked by carefully stacked stones, an icy lake dotted with aluminum canoes, the rustle of leaves and invisible critters. Ruefully, I realized where my imagination was taking me -- to my Girl Scout sleepaway camp in New Jersey, circa 1966.
I knew there was no way back (the condo developers had seen to that), yet I still craved those deep, idyllic childhood woods where I'd learned to build a fire, pilot a canoe and sing "Kumbaya." Where to find them? And, most important, because I am no longer inclined to rough it in pup tents and cook over a Coleman stove, where could I find a bargain wilderness with a double bed and private bath or shower? 
 Early one morning, the answer came as I leafed through the newspaper at breakfast. "Northwest Airlines Fare Sale," read an ad that listed cut-rate deals to that airline's home cities in Minnesota.
Minnesota! Coffee speeded up the free associations -- lakes . . . Lake Superior . . . the North Woods -- and I reached for the phone.
Three weeks later, in mid-August, I was in a Chevrolet Cavalier driving northeast toward the Canadian border on Highway 61 out of Duluth -- where Northwest flew me for $302 round trip from La Guardia. Thick stands of pine and aspen rose to my left, and to my right, Lake Superior's waves lapped a pebbled shore. The day was hot, but the air was crisp and tingly, and clouds feathered the sky. On the car radio, Bob Dylan, Minnesota's favorite musical son, was crooning "Tangled Up in Blue." The wail of his harmonica seemed the perfect soundtrack for my trip into Minnesota's Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, a network of hundreds of interconnected lakes, and the Superior Hiking Trail, a 226-mile wilderness track only a few miles above Highway 61's lifeline of small towns, hotels and restaurants. It was also music to a city slicker's ears, more reassuring than my dusty, little-used Swiss mountaineering boots rattling around in the trunk every time I hit a bump on the two-lane highway.
Although I'd had no trouble finding a cheap ticket to Minnesota, negotiating my way into the North Woods -- via the Lake Superior port town of Grand Marais, 120 miles north of Duluth -- was another story. To get the discounted fare, I had to fly into Duluth around midnight Wednesday, and return at 7 A.M. the following Monday. But Duluth's major auto rental chains weren't open for business when I needed to get and return a car. There was no public transportation. Just when I'd about given up on the whole plan, a chance call to the Duluth Chamber of Commerce tipped me to a local car rental agency, U-Save. Byron Kleimola, U-Save's manager, said he'd be glad to bring the car to my hotel the morning after my arrival (he even faxed me the numbers of some inexpensive hotels near the airport, from which I chose an Econo Lodge that cost $44 a night). Best of all, he'd arrange for me to return the car at the crack of dawn the following Monday morning.
"You can just leave it in the short-term airport parking lot unlocked with the keys under the visor," Mr. Kleimola said.
(Sharp intake of breath from aghast native New Yorker). "Er . . . unlocked?"
"Yep. Sure. Never had any problems before," he said, sounding a bit puzzled.
When he offered me the low rate of $24.99 a day for the four-day rental, I began to wonder what other surprises Minnesota would hold.
"Busy up here today isn't it, always is in summer," said the fellow strolling the main street of Two Harbors, the first stop on the three-hour drive to that night's destination, the Rockwood Lodge on Gunflint Trail. Two Harbors, with its two traffic lights and nearly deserted harbor seemed almost abandoned.
Outside Buddy's Wild Rice -- a store that sells rice, jams, honey and large wooden statues of bears and moose called "chainsaw art" -- a line of kitschy-looking homemade windmills whirred in the brisk breeze. I had to yell for someone. In what I was coming to understand as North Woods etiquette, the shop was left wide open, unlocked and unattended. I paid the clerk for a jar of creamy honey made from blueberry blossoms ($3.99), and hit the road again.
The traffic got sparser and the towns smaller as I continued north through a landscape that reminded me of the rural mid-Atlantic of 30 years ago -- the only things missing were the Burma-Shave signs. Along the road, brightly painted cottages converted for commercial use sold bait and tackle, or wood carvings, or homemade blueberry pie and locally smoked fish. Although I meandered, few cars sped to overtake me. The drive up Highway 61 is known for its spectacular scenery, and no drivers seemed inclined to rush it. Every few miles a marker and a turnoff signaled a parking area, and yet another gorgeous view of trees, rocks, lake and water's edge foam. I couldn't help but wish that I was traveling a few weeks later, for although what I saw was beautiful, during foliage season (mid-September) I knew it would be breathtaking.
I'd selected the Rockwood Lodge and Outfitters on a list that the Ranger Station of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness faxed to me in New York. Rockwood is on the shore of Poplar Lake, about 35 miles up Gunflint Trail, a narrow paved road that runs uphill and inland from the Lake Superior harbor town of Grand Marais. I pulled in, and instantly was transported back to my camp days; the tiny wooden cabins tucked among the pines beside the dark lake recaptured my childhood memories.
Poplar Lake isn't part of the Boundary Waters, but it's a popular entry point to dozens of smaller lakes in the Government-protected preserve.
No motorboats are allowed on these waters, where canoers portage their gear and boats from lake to lake, as they've done since the pre-Colonial days when Ojibway Indians and voyageurs hunted beaver in these woods. Rockwood's clients are mainly fishing enthusiasts and wilderness buffs from Minnesota who come up for overnight trips, which require a permit.
I didn't have the time for that -- and I feared I didn't have the skill either. So I arranged to stay overnight in Rockwood's plain but comfortable bunkhouse with private bath ($40), and spend a day exploring Poplar Lake with its 27 islands by canoe (rental $25).
The details of my first hour alone on Poplar Lake in a two-man, 57-pound We-noh-nah canoe are best left untold (let's just say that if the lake had been the "Wheel of Fortune," my canoe would have been the spinner). But gradually, slowly, my Girl Scout chops kicked in -- and, fortunately, Mark, the outfitting assistant, figured out that putting a heavy rock in the bow would help counteract the stiff headwind.
With the ballast in place, I flew across the lake, rounded a series of wooded islands, and steered through a channel into a narrow arm of water. It was silent, except for the wind and an occasional loon, and once I pulled out of sight of the lodge, I was utterly, completely alone.
Thanks to Mark's careful directions, I found the entry for the portage to Meads Lake, dragged my canoe ashore over rocks, and sat down to rest for a moment -- until a squadron of hungry Minnesota black mosquitoes decided it was lunchtime. I put on those dusty boots and outran them, making swift tracks along the portage trail, sans canoe -- for I couldn't even imagine carrying such a heavy load more than 20 feet. The path continued for a mile across boggy lowlands, then opened, dramatically -- and there was Meads Lake, silent, dark and empty.
You could go right through to Canada like this, from lake to lake, and the idea appealed to me, at least in theory. In practice, Rockwood's big wood-burning sauna seemed like a better idea than Canada, so I headed back to my canoe.
I paddled around for a few more lovely, quiet hours until late afternoon, then called it a day. At night I drove three miles down Gunflint to the Trail Center Black Bear Bar and Restaurant (Rockwood serves no food), a bustling roadhouse popular with local residents that has stuffed bears and moose antlers hanging from the rafters. All the tables were full, so I elbowed up to the bar and ordered the thing I most craved: a jalapeno cheeseburger ($6.50).
I'd only planned a single day of canoeing at Rockwood -- a mistake, as it turned out, because I woke up the next morning longing to feel the steady rhythms of paddling through water again. But I had booked a Friday and Saturday night stay with my credit card ($80 a night at the time of my stay) at the popular Pincushion Bed-and-Breakfast just outside of Grand Marais. The Pincushion sits alongside paths that feed into the Superior Hiking Trail, so it looked like the perfect location for the hiking segment of my expedition.
EXPLORING the town of Grand Marais (population 1,170), on my way to Pincushion, I began to regret my reservation plans. I stumbled onto the sweetest little motel nestled in a grove of birch trees off Highway 61. The white cottages at Trailside Cabins and Motel seemed to have been frozen in the 1950's. The cottage closest to the road had a big red sign that said "Tiny Tim" over an old-style screen door and red metal garden chairs on a front porch. I peeked inside another, larger cottage and yearned to stay in the clean, pine-paneled cabin with its own kitchenette. To make matters worse, when I inquired I found that the cabin rented for just $55 a night. The only news that made me feel better was that it was already taken -- as were all five other cabins at Trailside, and at the half-dozen similar old-fashioned mom-and-pop motel camps that dot Grand Marais. Warning: Reservations are essential for summer weekends in the North Woods.
Compared with the rustic cabins, Pincushion initially disappointed me. It was a modern, suburban-style, three-story house with four guest rooms and two wooden decks. Its proprietors, Scott and Mary Beattie, however, more than compensated for any architectural letdown. In the common room, around the big dining table, Scott, a lanky cross-country ski instructor, pored over trail guides with me, while recounting local tales. He steered me to a city-caliber restaurant facing Lake Superior called the Angry Trout Cafe and the Gunflint Tavern, where the TV is permanently tuned to the Weather Channel (Grand Marais gets more than 100 inches of snow every year). My comfy bedroom had a double bed, sink and a private bathroom with a shower across the hall.
With Scott's help, I chose a remote, five-mile section of the Superior Hiking Trail, about 20 miles north of Pincushion, that followed a ridge to a point enticingly called "Hellacious Overlook." Toting a rucksack containing two bottles of water ($2), a takeout cheese sandwich from the Loafer Cafe ($3.75) and a rain parka, and wearing those heavy boots, I set out. Once again in this "busy" season I passed not a single soul for five hours, and saw not a trace of humans, not even a boot track. But I did see four beavers playing in a beaver pond on the trail (I fell into the muck with my camera trying to take their picture). As I climbed along the rocky ridge, pine, aspen and fir groves parted to reveal glimpses of Lake Superior shining far below.
On my last day in the North Country, at Scott's suggestion, I drove another 35 miles north to Grand Portage, just three miles from Canada, where the local Ojibway Indian nation was acting as host for its annual powwow. It was open to the public, and it was free. I had never been to a powwow and didn't know what to expect. Part marketplace, part fair, part ceremony, it was wonderful.
I watched as a solemn file of elders marched out onto the field carrying eagle feathers on staffs, accompanied by a uniformed honor guard. At a signal, the warriors began to dance in honor of the many Ojibway veterans of the armed forces, many of whom were present. The best drummers and singers from Ojibway nations in several states were there, and they gathered in circles to urge the dancers on. I drew close to one circle, so close I could feel the pounding of their large skin drum in my bones. I imagined I was putting my ear to the ground and listening to the North Country's heartbeat. It felt good, and soothing, like the rocking of a canoe, like memories of childhood.
 
The bottom line: by land or lake
I spent about $80 a day for accommodations, meals and activities during my five-night stay in Minnesota's Northeast.
I bought my round-trip ticket in July from New York to Duluth on Northwest Airlines for $302.
A Chevrolet Cavalier from U-Save Auto Rental, (218) 733-0200, cost me $24.99 a day, not including a 12.7 percent state tax. The rate included 600 free miles. I drove 470 and filled the tank once for $17.
 
Lodging
The Duluth Airport Econo Lodge, 4197 Haines Road, Duluth, Minn. 55811, (800)922-0569, was a bit better than I expected. My clean, no-smoking single room with king-sized bed was bigger than usual for a budget hotel, about 20 by 12 feet. I asked for, and got, a corporate discount on the $49 rate, which brought my cost to $44.
I arranged to stay in the bunk room at Rockwood Lodge and Outfitters, 50 Rockwood Road, Gunflint Trail, Grand Marais, Minn. 55604, (800) 942-2922, the night before my canoe jaunt. It had seven Spartan bunk beds and reminded me a bit of an army camp, but it was clean and comfortable and the bathroom even had a tub. At $40 (which rents the entire bunk room) the price was right. Rockwood also has seven cabins with kitchens, from $110 to $160 a day.
I fell in love with the 50's-style cabins at Trailside Cabins and Motel, Box 155, Grand Marais, Minn. 55604, (218) 387-1550, and plan to go back someday and rent No. 5, a tiny cottage with queen bed, kitchenette and private bath. Five other cabins and eight motel rooms rented at prices ranging from $40 to $70.
Pincushion Bed-and-Breakfast, 968 Gunflint Trail, Grand Marais, Minn. 55604, (800) 542-1226, was a wise choice for a first venture into the area, because my hosts, Scott and Mary Beattie, are a wellspring of information about hiking, canoeing -- and even where to spot a moose. The modern, two-story house has four guest rooms.
I stayed in "Maple," which had a queen bed and a separate but private bath across the hall. The price of $80 for a single ($90, double) included a hearty breakfast (prices are now $90 and $99).
 
Places to Eat
Trail Center Black Bear Bar and Restaurant, 7611 Gunflint Trail, (218) 388-2214, is the hottest, and just about the only, eatery on the Gunflint Trail, open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The average dinner bill for one runs about $10 to $12. Their "Up North" omelet, with eggs, wild rice and Cheddar cheese, is a house specialty.
While the entrees on the menu at the Angry Trout Cafe, on Highway 61, (218) 387-1265, seemed pricey at about $15 a plate, they ended up being a great deal, because the price included not only fresh locally caught fish, but a huge salad course and a side of pesto fettucine. The bonus is that you can eat outside, facing Lake Superior.
The Gunflint Tavern, 111 Wisconsin Street, Grand Marais, (218) 387-1563, serves simple sandwiches and unusual bar munchies like a smoked trout pate with crackers, all for about $6.50 an item.
 
Activities
Rockwood Lodge and Outfitters (see above) will equip your entire canoeing expedition, or simply rent you a canoe for the day: my two-person We-noh-nah cost $25 and included a map, the use of oars and life jacket, and an itinerary consultation.
The Superior Hiking Trail Association, 731 Seventh Avenue, Two Harbors, (218) 834-2700, is the volunteer organization that maintains and promotes the 226-mile-long trail that eventually will run from the Canadian border all the way to Duluth. It sells trail maps and an excellent trail guide.

HEADLINE: CLASSICAL MUSIC;
As Teachers, The Modest Are Often The Best

BYLINE: By Bernard Holland 

 BODY:
TEACHERS come in different shapes and sizes, and finding the right fit might sort out some of the educational controversies going on at the Tanglewood Festival up in Lenox, Mass. The troubles have been well rehearsed in these pages, and are not likely to go away when the season ends this weekend. Have Tanglewood's long-respected summer programs been emasculated by dismissals and resignations, or have they been reinvigorated by a new involvement on the part of the Boston Symphony and its music director, Seiji Ozawa?
Keeping score is not easy, for good things can happen at the same time damage is being done. The first question for all parties is simply, "What is it that music teachers do?" "Teach music" is no answer. There are too many kinds of teaching going on. 
 Let's begin with the celebrities. They divide into two categories: performers with public profiles, and teachers whose powers of connection attract exceptional students. Great performers are occasionally great teachers, but not often. Yet their presence in academia (when they are not off giving concerts) is a strong attractant. Just as law firms hire former Cabinet members to drum up clients, so music schools use the famous name as a kind of logo. The student prospers, too, for no matter how little he or she learns, the advertisement can read, "Student of the Great So-and-So."
My piano teacher at the Paris Conservatory -- a woman of astonishing technique, minimal teaching skill and sublime ignorance of any style but her own -- had once, over a period of three or four lessons, played the keyboard pieces of Ravel for the composer. Ravel, she told me, corrected the many typographical errors in the Durand edition, suggested tempos and interpretive ideas, collected his substantial fee, then saw the lady no more. An abbreviated course of study, not cheap, but there was a reward. "Student of Ravel": think of the authority that title conveyed on her interpretations, no matter what nonsense she superimposed on the master's wishes.
The celebrity performer and celebrity teacher are doorkeepers, with access to important managers and intendants. Students find their way under such wings, grateful for the connections and happy for any learning at all. (It often comes in the form of tips: how to finger that hard passage in the Chopin G minor Ballade, what to leave out in the Brahms Second Piano Concerto.)
Performers typically charge fees in the hundreds of dollars per hour simply to discourage applicants. They would rather be practicing. Celebrity teachers charge big fees because they can get them. Amend "There are no great teachers, only great students" to read, "Teachers succeed professionally by their ability to attract great students."
Another category of teacher is the kind Tanglewood seems to have lost in considerable numbers during the recent unpleasantness: the teacher of music, a performer who might operate on the fringes of the public music world or might not play concerts at all. Like coaches in major league baseball, they are eloquent purveyors of information, for struggling with their own hard-earned skills has forced them into a self-examination largely foreign to the easy virtuoso.
Teachers of music are less interested in the careers of their students than in the passing-on of styles and traditions. Achieving the right balances in a Haydn string quartet supersedes winning an audition before a 57th Street manager. The teacher of music is less a reservoir of useful tricks than a purveyor of information: which tempo might work, how harmony affects accentuation, what a phrase mark means, how "allegro" in 1780 and "allegro" in 1880 mean different things. I learned something about piano playing from my Paris teacher simply by standing behind her and watching. I learned more about music from an unpleasant and disheveled old man in Pittsburgh than from any celebrity.
I am delighted to hear of the euphoria with which the "new" Tanglewood seems to have been greeted this summer. Mr. Ozawa and his Boston players are evidently doing good things. Robert Spano will still be teaching conductors, asking questions of his students, so that they will find their own answers. But elsewhere at Tanglewood there is a broader question to be asked: What is the purpose of a music school altogether? Is it preparation for jobs, or is its first aim to deepen understanding?
I am troubled by the idea of classes teaching violinists how to be concertmasters. These are practical skills better won by sitting in the second-violin section of an orchestra and observing. Would not such class time at Tanglewood be better spent pondering Beethoven's ambiguous accent marks and Mozart's overlapping slurs. At the risk of offending my journalistic colleagues, if I were a newspaper executive faced with hiring either a journalism-school graduate trained in news-gathering or a good writer steeped in economics, history and political science but with no news experience, I would choose the latter every time. The difference between knowledge and expertise is misunderstood these days.
I know I shall also offend the Guarneri String Quartet by questioning its recent addition to Tanglewood's faculty. The Guarneri has a distinguished past and a high public profile, and maybe its players are splendid teachers despite their persistently crude performances in recent seasons. Yet the troubling possibility remains that their presence has as much to do with public relations as with musical substance. At any rate, the gain of these four players and the loss of Gilbert Kalish, Leon Fleisher, Joel Krosnick and Julius Levine seems not an equal trade.

HEADLINE: Winning the Drug War Isn't So Hard After All

BYLINE: By Michael Massing; Michael Massing is the author of The Fix, from which this essay is adapted. His article on the alcohol lobby appeared in the magazine in March.

 BODY:
Don't let rudolph giuliani fool you: methadone works. Since its introduction in the mid-1960's, studies have consistently shown that the synthetic narcotic cuts addicts' craving for heroin, enabling onetime street junkies to restart their lives. In so doing, methadone helps boost employment, inhibit the spread of H.I.V. and cut crime. That's why the New York City Mayor's recent attacks -- he denounced methadone as a chemical that's used to enslave people and promised to abolish it from the city over the next few years -- have left experts scratching their heads.
The Mayor appears driven by a moral conviction that complete abstinence from drugs is the only acceptable course. Yet if Giuliani were truly interested in promoting abstinence from drugs, he would have not simply condemned methadone but also announced a major expansion of treatment programs whose express goal is to wean addicts from the substance. (The city has virtually no such programs now.) He would also have announced the creation of more residential programs that seek to change addicts' behavior. The Mayor's failure to do any of this raises the suspicion that it is not just methadone he dislikes -- but drug treatment in general. 
 In this respect, Giuliani reflects a national mood. For nearly 20 years, the United States has waged a relentless war on drugs, with treatment discounted as a weak weapon. Instead, the Government has sent spy planes swooshing over the Caribbean, built a paramilitary base in Peru, mounted coca-eradication programs in Bolivia -- and invaded Panama. On the home front, narcotics agents have infiltrated hundreds of drug gangs and busted countless drug dealers. In 1996, more than 1.5 million people were arrested for drug offenses; the nation's prisons, which in 1980 housed fewer than 30,000 drug offenders, today harbor nearly 300,000.
But this punitive approach has failed. Cocaine is cheaper than ever, and heroin is selling at purity levels three times greater than those of the mid-1980's. And drug abuse remains rampant. In 1996, the number of cocaine-related visits to hospital emergency rooms topped 144,000, an all-time high. This despite an increase in the Federal antidrug budget from $1 billion in 1981 to $16 billion in 1998.
Looking at numbers like these, it may seem as if the nation's drug problem is all but intractable. But it isn't. Our penchant for punishment has blinded us to the most effective strategy for combating drug use: offering comprehensive treatment to every addict who requests it.
Unfortunately, the case for expanding our commitment to treatment programs frequently gets drowned out by more extreme voices. Law-and-order types like Giuliani call for ever more police dragnets and undercover investigations. On the opposing side, reformers push for drastic measures like drug legalization. Legalize drugs, they say, and the vast criminal networks that traffic in them will disappear -- much like the repeal of Prohibition led to the demise of speak-easies and bathtub gin. The end of Prohibition, however, also led to a sharp rise in alcohol use. Between 1934 and 1944, per capita consumption in the United States rose from 0.97 gallons to 2.07 gallons. (Today it is 2.25 gallons.) If illicit drugs were suddenly legalized, might not consumption similarly rise?
By now, the risks of legalization have become so evident that many onetime advocates have flocked to a new standard: harm reduction. Drugs, it is argued, are here to stay, and society needs to learn how to live with them. Our goal should be to reduce the harm that drugs cause. To that end, they advocate a variety of reforms, like expanding needle-exchange programs and creating safe injection rooms as alternatives to shooting galleries.
Some of these ideas clearly make sense. Needle-exchange programs, for one, have been shown to reduce the transmission of H.I.V. Yet harm reduction has serious limitations. For the most part, it does not seek to get people off drugs but merely to help them use drugs more safely. To express disapproval of addiction would, in the harm reductionists' view, reinforce society's intolerance of drug addicts. While promoting tolerance is admirable, the harm reductionists take it too far: if you should not stigmatize addicts, neither should you condone addiction. And with its learn-to-live-with-drugs approach, harm reduction offers no guidance on how to bring down the appallingly high levels of drug addiction in this country.
Harm reduction does, at least, acknowledge one key fact: helping chronic users should be the target of drug policy. Washington doesn't understand this. From recent actions in the nation's capital -- like Congress's decision to earmark $1 billion for antidrug advertising aimed at teen-agers -- you might logically conclude that the threat drugs pose to the nation consists mainly of adolescent use. In fact, teen-age drug use, while up some in recent years, remains well below the peak levels of the late 1970's. What's more, most of that increase consists of marijuana use. And while pot is not harmless, and young people should be discouraged from using it, it is not the problem heroin and cocaine are.
In contrast to teen-age pot smokers, adults who regularly use heroin, cocaine and crack do pose problems: they commit muggings, abuse children, suffer overdoses and spread disease. In all, there are an estimated 3.6 million hard-core users in the United States. While these addicts constitute only 20 percent of all drug users in the country (most of the rest being casual, occasional users), they consume about three-fourths of all the cocaine and heroin used here.
Who are these problem users? Contrary to the many media accounts of strung-out stockbrokers and models, addicts tend to be found not in posh condominiums or suburban split-levels but in the housing projects of urban America. Heavy users are disproportionately poor, unemployed and members of minority groups. No headway can be made in alleviating the nation's drug problem without finding a way to get such users off drugs.
A good place to begin is suggested by a 1994 RAND study. The researchers C. Peter Rydell and Susan Everingham set out to compare the effectiveness of four types of drug-control programs: source-country efforts (attacking drug production abroad), interdiction (seizing drugs in transit to the U.S.), domestic law enforcement (arresting and incarcerating sellers and buyers) and drug treatment. How much additional money, they asked, would the Government have to spend on each approach to reduce national cocaine consumption by 1 percent? Rydell and Everingham developed a model of the national cocaine market, then fed into it more than 70 variables, from seizure data to survey responses.
They were amazed at the results. Relying solely on domestic law enforcement, the Government would have to spend an additional $246 million to reduce U.S. cocaine consumption by 1 percent. Relying on interdiction, it would have to spend $366 million, and on source-country programs, a whopping $783 million. Relying solely on drug treatment, however, the Government would have to spend just $34 million more. In other words, treatment was 7 times more cost effective than domestic law enforcement, 10 times more effective than interdiction and 23 times more effective than attacking drugs at their source.
Such results contradict the conventional wisdom that treatment does not work. Many Americans know of someone who entered a program and did well while in it, only to relapse afterward. Nevertheless, failed treatments do not cost very much and so do not dilute the cost-effectiveness of treatment overall. More important, study after study has demonstrated the efficacy of treatment.
In one recent analysis, the Government tracked the performance of 4,400 clients who entered treatment between July 1993 and October 1995. Those clients were interviewed at the time they began treatment, at the time they finished and a year later; the accuracy of their responses was checked by random drug tests. Seeking to study the most severe cases, the researchers concentrated on programs serving people in public housing, on welfare and in the criminal-justice system. The number of clients saying they used crack dropped from 39.5 percent prior to treatment to 17.8 percent a year later; for heroin, the number went from 23.6 percent to 12.6 percent. All told, drug consumption decreased by roughly 50 percent.
Well, skeptics will say, treatment might be effective for addicts who receive it, but how many really want it? Junkies, it's commonly believed, simply do not want help. And to an extent, that's true. Drugs not only impart intense pleasure but also provide great comfort to people coping with various crises in their lives. Yet for many, the point eventually comes when the drugs themselves begin to cause problems, from physical ailments to family quarrels to legal troubles. And when that happens, addicts are often open to help. That openness, however, is usually quite fleeting, and unless it is exploited immediately, most will end up back on the streets.
Alas, help is rarely available immediately. Consider the situation in New York State. An estimated 1.6 million residents have a drug or alcohol problem serious enough to require treatment. In any given year, roughly 25 percent of that number, or 400,000, will seek help. To serve them, the state has 121,000 publicly funded slots. With those slots turning over throughout the year, the state can accommodate nearly 300,000 people annually. That leaves more than 100,000 people a year unable to get help.
Scarcity is just the start of the problem. In the world of New York health care, drug treatment is the Balkans: a chaotic realm full of internal strife and rivalries. Each treatment program features a different regimen and serves distinct populations. Not every program is right for every individual. Yet the city has no central place where addicts can go to apply for admission. There is not even a registry listing openings. If a Holiday Inn is full, it will at least call the Ramada down the street to see if it has a vacancy; not so two treatment programs. As for addicts who do enter the system, there's no one to monitor their progress and make sure they stay on course.
Fortunately, there exists a remedy to such problems: central intake units, places where addicts can go to get immediate attention. Appearing here, addicts would meet with the first available counselor to discuss the nature of their problem and the best way to address it. After deciding on the proper therapy -- a detox, a methadone program, a residential facility -- the counselor would consult a computerized directory of openings. Once a specific program was selected and the client accepted for admission, central intake would arrange transportation and assign an escort. If a program didn't work out, central intake could arrange an alternative. While such units might seem to constitute yet another layer of bureaucracy, their coordinating role would actually help reduce red tape.
In addition, central intake could dispatch outreach teams into drug markets to recruit addicts into treatment. Approaching users on the street, such workers would inform them of the services available and encourage them to visit central intake. If these teams worked in the early morning hours, when many addicts are coming down from their drugs, they could significantly boost the number of people entering the system.
Of course, recruiting addicts into treatment will accomplish little if there is nowhere to put them. And sadly, the treatment shortages present in New York are common throughout the country. According to the U.S. Office of National Drug Control Policy, fully half of the nation's hard-core users -- 1.7 million people -- cannot get help due to the lack of slots. (Methadone is in particularly short supply, with just 115,000 of the 800,000 chronic heroin users receiving it. In New York City, only 35,000 out of 200,000 users do.)
During the 1992 Presidential campaign, Bill Clinton promised to rectify this. In a Clinton-Gore Administration, Federal assistance will help communities dramatically increase their ability to offer drug treatment to everyone who needs help, he wrote in Putting People First. Six years later, the nation is no closer to reaching that goal. Under Clinton, fully two-thirds of the Federal drug budget goes for law enforcement and interdiction, with the remainder going for treatment and prevention -- the same proportion as under the Bush Administration. The current drug czar, Barry R. McCaffrey, is a retired four-star general who before taking office had no experience with drug treatment, and while he has frequently acknowledged the importance of treatment, he has made this a low priority. And so the treatment gap persists.
That a focus on treatment can work is apparent from the one time it was actually tried -- during the Nixon Administration. A staunch advocate of law and order, Nixon deferred to no one in his strident pronouncements on drugs, but during the 1968 campaign he promised to bring down the nation's crime rate, and once in office, he faced the need to deliver.
At the time, the nation was in the throes of a raging heroin epidemic; if something could be done to sap it, Nixon's advisers believed, the crime wave might abate. One obvious approach was to try to reduce the flow of heroin into the country. At the time, the main conduit was the French Connection, a 5,000-mile pipeline originating in Turkish poppy fields and passing through France. The Nixon Administration began pressing the French and Turkish Governments to crack down on local drug trafficking.
But the more Nixon's drug officials looked into the problem, the more they became convinced that reducing the supply of drugs would prove futile unless something was also done to reduce the demand. On that front, a new weapon was available: methadone. Early studies showed that addicts maintained on methadone were much more likely to hold jobs and far less likely to commit crimes. At the time, methadone, like drug treatment in general, was largely unavailable in most cities. An exception was Chicago, where a young psychopharmacologist named Jerome Jaffe had set up a network of treatment programs that was helping get addicts off the streets. A central intake unit was opened in downtown Chicago, and addicts appearing at it were assigned to the type of program they needed -- detox, residential, methadone maintenance, methadone-to-abstinence and so on.
Impressed, President Nixon announced in 1971 the creation of a Drug Abuse Prevention office; to head it, he brought in Jaffe from Chicago. Once in place, Jaffe found that about 30,000 people were on treatment waiting lists; resolving this problem became his top priority. He faced resistance from many quarters, including Congress, the bureaucracy and his fellow mental-health professionals, but Jaffe -- a brilliant if prickly iconoclast -- managed to outmaneuver them all. By the fall of 1972, treatment was available to all those who wanted it.
The impact was immediate. In New York City, the crime rate in 1972 dropped 18 percent, and in Washington, 26.9 percent. Nationally, the crime rate fell by 3 percent, the first decline in 17 years. Declines were also recorded in the rate of heroin-overdose deaths, hepatitis transmission and drug-related hospital visits -- strong testimony to the efficacy of a national treatment system.
Yet from the moment it was created, that system came under attack. And so in the 1972 Presidential campaign, Nixon began shifting the focus back toward drug enforcement. During the Ford and Carter years, the treatment budget suffered from the effects of both inflation and neglect. The real turning point came under Reagan. In his view, addicts were morally responsible for their behavior and therefore undeserving of Government help. As Nancy Reagan toured the country, urging Americans to just say no to drugs, her husband slashed the funding for drug treatment and boosted it for drug enforcement. By the time crack hit in the mid-1980's, the treatment system Jaffe built had been gutted, and addicts -- showing up at clinics desperate for help -- were regularly turned back onto the streets, there to commit more crime.
It was not until the late 1980's that the Federal Government finally began pumping more funds into treatment. In fact, the nation's treatment budget is now larger than it was in the 1970's. Sadly, our drug problem is larger as well, as long waiting lists attest. It is time to follow the example of Jerome Jaffe and make elimination of those lists a top priority.
But how much would that cost? According to in-house calculations by the drug czar's office, filling the nation's treatment gap would require increasing the Federal treatment budget by $3.4 billion a year. Of the $16 billion Washington now spends to fight drugs, $10.6 billion goes for supply reduction and $5.4 billion for demand reduction. If the overall budget was held constant but the allocation for these two areas equalized at $8 billion, the demand side would receive an additional $2.6 billion -- close to the sum in question. But the Clinton Administration -- worried about looking soft on drugs -- seems little interested in making such a transfer.
By itself, of course, such a change would not solve the nation's drug problem. Rooted as it is in low-income communities, that problem is inseparable from the nation's other social ills, like inadequate housing, poor schooling and unemployment. Until these conditions are addressed, drug abuse will remain a fixture of American life. But by following the public health approach outlined here, Washington could reduce that problem to a far more manageable scale. When it comes to drug policy, Americans need not choose between their hearts and their heads; in this area, compassion is itself cost effective. Clearly, the war on drugs is not.

HEADLINE: Ken Starr Would Not Be Denied

BYLINE: By Michael Winerip; Michael Winerip is a staff writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
When Kenneth Starr was chosen to investigate Whitewater in 1994, the White House counsel, Abner Mikva, assured the Clintons that this was a fine selection. Mikva and Starr had known each other for years. During the 1980's, the two men served together on the Federal Appeals Court in Washington, and though they were on opposite ends of the political spectrum, the liberal Mikva and the conservative Starr were friends. Mikva and Starr socialized at each other's homes, dined out together with their wives. When Mikva thought of Starr, words like "ethical," "fair," "decent" came to mind. If Mikva saw a fault in the younger judge, it was that Starr was a little too much of an egghead, too pedantic, just not street-smart. This was brought home to Mikva one day during a near fistfight at the Federal courthouse. Starr, Mikva and Laurence Silberman were on a three-judge panel and, when they retired to the conference room, it turned out that Silberman was furious with Mikva over the case they had just heard. "Silberman said to me, 'If you were 10 years younger, I'd punch you out!' " Mikva recalls. "I look over, and there was Ken, looking at the ceiling, wishing he was not there. He never said a word. I attributed it to the gentle son of a minister who didn't like controversy."
And so, in August 1994, Mikva assured the Clintons: "Ken and I had good relations on the court and I'm sure it will continue." 
 Twice during 1995, Starr wanted to question both the President and the First Lady in connection with the Arkansas inquiries, and each time arranged it with Mikva. "The milieu could not have been more pleasant or cooperative," Mikva says. "Upstairs in the White House residence, both times on a Saturday. He arrived discreetly through the back entrance. He later issued a short statement. There was no commenting or leaking to the press." Mikva walked Starr out after one session and thanked him. "I said: 'I realize it was not done for this President. I appreciate your concern for the Presidency.' He said: 'I would not have it any other way. The Republicans will elect a President again and I want the Presidency to be there.' "
Starr was considered too bland in those days to have political enemies, and if he did, they would probably have been conservative Republicans. In 1981, as an aide to Attorney General William French Smith, Starr shepherded Sandra Day O'Connor's Supreme Court nomination through the Senate and was attacked by conservatives for having covered up O'Connor's pro-choice views. After President Bush appointed him Solicitor General in 1989, Starr showed his independence on his first controversial case, defying the President by siding with a group of whistle-blowers against defense contractors.
Even after Starr took a million-dollar-a-year corporate law job at Kirkland & Ellis in 1993, he was viewed by the Washington establishment as the perfect man for handling delicate public matters. When the Congressional committee investigating sexual-harassment charges against Senator Bob Packwood needed someone to review the most intimate secrets in Packwood's diaries, Starr was hired. His law partners watched him rushing about, installing a lock on his door, setting aside a special table as the only place the diaries could be reviewed and declaring that only the office administrator could carry the diaries in and out of a special vault.
In October 1995, Mikva left the White House, still on good terms with Starr. But what happened a few months later radically changed Mikva's feelings and embarrassed him in front of the Clintons, who were by then referring to the independent counsel as "your friend Ken Starr."
"I was shocked when Mrs. Clinton was called before the grand jury and he made her go to the courthouse," Mikva says. "He could have taken her testimony under oath at the White House. He knew there was no back stairway at that courthouse, that she'd have to walk right in front of the barrage of cameras. Ken knew that courthouse better than anyone. When he and I were on the bench there in the 1980's, there was a U.S. Attorney, Jay Stephens, who constantly used the press -- he'd call press conferences in front of the courthouse to announce an indictment and then haul in the defendant in front of the cameras. Ken and I used to stand together at an upstairs window looking down. We agreed that using the press as a prosecutorial tool was not something an ethical prosecutor did.
"The Judge Starr I knew was cautious, deliberate, careful, not zealous and reckless. The Ken Starr I see now is not the Ken Starr I knew."
Is it true? Is there really a new Ken Starr? Rusty Hardin thinks so too, although he draws a very different conclusion. Hardin, a lawyer in the independent counsel's office at the start of the Whitewater investigation, says that Starr needed to learn to think like a prosecutor. He had never been one, had never even been a trial lawyer, had spent his career in the high-altitude world of appellate law. "Appellate lawyers don't stand up before the Court of Appeals and call each other expletive -- they don't question each other's motives," Hardin says. "Prosecutors live with that." The reserved Starr drove his assistant prosecutors mad, endlessly weighing and deliberating every matter. "Starr was more concerned with what people thought of him," Hardin says. "But the more the White House stonewalled, the more he hunkered down."
Over time, his assistants began to glimpse a new fire in Prosecutor Starr. Frustrated by Gov. Jim Guy Tucker of Arkansas's legal challenges to the independent counsel's jurisdiction, Starr argued the appeal himself. The moment that decision came down from the Eighth Circuit, Eric Jaso, an assistant in Little Rock, informed Starr that they had won on every point.
"Ken let out a yell," Jaso recalls. "He yelled, 'Total and complete victory!' I wrote it on my screen saver -- 'Total and Complete Victory!' Ken said, 'This is fantastic!' He was excited, breathless with exhilaration."
What drives Ken Starr onward? Who is this minister's son in such relentless pursuit that he forced the President to admit his sins on national television?
Very soon, this man the public knows so little about will command the nation's undivided attention. After spending more than four years and an estimated $40 million investigating Whitewater, Filegate, Travelgate, Vincent Foster's death and the Lewinsky matter, Starr is expected to deliver his final report to Congress in the coming weeks. For the first time, the public will get Starr's full view of the President's wrongdoing; the report will also tell us a good deal about its author and about the quality and scope of the investigation. Then we will all have to decide: Should the matter have been dropped long ago? Did Starr lose all sense of proportion? Or does he make the case for a criminal cover-up worthy of impeachment?
For his part, Starr is not talking, and has never talked much publicly about himself. He has granted few on-the-record interviews in the last four years to reporters writing profiles of him and has refused repeated requests over a four-month period to be interviewed for this article. The only on-the-record interview he has done on any subject recently -- conducted in April by Steven Brill for his media magazine, Brill's Content -- landed Starr in trouble with a Federal judge over leaking information to the press about the investigation. And so, morning after morning, TV crews camp out in front of his McLean, Va., home at dawn, shooting fresh video of the man walking to his car with his Starbucks coffee, trying to prod him into a sound bite.
Nor was Starr willing to permit an interview with his wife, Alice, although she made the single-most-telling comment about what their lives are like these days, during an hourlong profile of Starr shown by the A&E network in June. "Sometimes," Alice Starr said, "it seems like a nightmare that won't ever go away, and I always think to myself, It can't get worse than this. And it does. Every day it seems to get worse and worse."
Of course, it didn't have to go on this long. A different independent counsel might have ended things a lot sooner. In 1987, James McKay, a Democrat, began investigating Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d, a Republican. After a year, McKay concluded that Meese had broken the law by accepting favors from a defense contractor and could be convicted by a jury. Meese's behavior was so troubling that two of his top aides at the Justice Department, William Weld and Arnold Burns, fellow Republicans, resigned in protest. But that independent counsel decided against taking the case to trial; McKay thought the scope of Meese's wrongdoing was not worth the political trauma that would be caused by putting the nation's top law-enforcement officer on trial. McKay says he feels the same way about the Lewinsky matter, that Starr has gone "so far afield": "We could have gone off on things with Meese, but I said no. It makes your blood run cold, the idea of looking into a case about sexual affairs."
Who is Ken Starr that he saw his mission so differently? In hopes of any insight, I followed him to Toronto in early August for the speech he delivers every year at the American Bar Association convention reviewing recent Supreme Court decisions.
He spoke on "the new textualism." Reporters' pens barely moved. Still, hungry people will take what crumbs they can, and afterward a dean of a major law school told me that it was a blatantly political speech, an effort to butter up the Supreme Court, particularly the Democrat-appointed Justices, so they would be happy to see Starr the next time he argued before them. "Did you see all the nice things he said about Breyer and Ginsburg?" the dean asked.
Had I missed it? Was Starr sending coded messages to Supreme Court Justices via C-Span 2? Who knew? In time, I learned that tracking Starr was like following Chauncey Gardiner around in "Being There" -- you could read into him almost whatever you wanted.
I pored over Starr's past speeches but found they offered little insight into the human being behind the ideas. At Duke University's 1995 commencement, he talked about "accountability"; at a 1996 meeting of the Economics Club of Detroit, he spoke of "civic virtue." (He was in favor of both.)
In May at a Charlotte, N.C., bar association meeting, he urged lawyers to take "the moral high ground of Atticus Finch," the brave country lawyer in "To Kill a Mockingbird," Harper Lee's novel, "who strove to find the truth while defending a black man wrongly accused." In terms of content, the speech was one of Starr's best, discussing the balance a lawyer must maintain between defending a client and serving the truth. But in tone, it was a disaster and widely ridiculed. Ken Starr, the million-dollar corporate lawyer who represents tobacco companies, was urging his fellow lawyers to be more like Atticus Finch? Didn't he know what this would sound like? How much perspective on Ken Starr did Ken Starr have?
Mostly what Starr talks about these days in his rare public moments is his search for truth. In the Atticus Finch speech, he used the word "truth" 25 times. In his TV sound bites, he comes across as some Old World prophet, but instead of wandering the desert he is rushing in and out of courthouses, hurrying up and down his driveway. "Our job is to get at the truth, and the truth will speak for itself," he says. Or, "My commitment is to the people and to the pursuit of the truth." Or, in his most famous variation, analyzed and reanalyzed for its religious overtones: "There's no room for white lies. There's no room for shading. You cannot defile the temple of justice." He has also compared himself to Sgt. Joe Friday. Just the facts, ma'am. Frequently, his spokesman, Charles Bakaly 3d, warns reporters, "We're the only ones who have all the facts."
Everyone has a theory on Starr. After the Lewinsky affair broke, Hillary Clinton called Starr "a politically motivated prosecutor who is allied with the right-wing opponents of my husband." Harold Ickes, the former Clinton aide, says he sees Starr as a dangerous moralist who views the Clintons "like Sodom and Gomorrah and is hellbent on running them out of Washington."
Even Starr's best friends don't fully know what to make of it all. They were caught off guard when he took the independent counsel's job in 1994 and are not sure why he wanted it. "I have no idea," says Theodore Olson, a prominent Washington lawyer. "He never asked me. I was shocked when I heard the news."
As Starr advanced in his career, he made a habit of consulting his close friends for political advice. Those friends -- Olson, Tex Lezar, Bob McConnell, John Roberts, Henry Habicht -- had all worked with Starr in the Reagan Justice Department in the early 1980's. They were bright, ambitious young conservatives who had regular morning and lunch meetings with Attorney General Smith and competed to see which one could get into work first each day. But Starr did not call them after a three-judge appellate panel offered him the independent counsel's job in the summer of 1994. "It's the only time with one of these difficult decisions he didn't," Lezar says. Several felt he had made a mistake, that it was a political no-win situation -- depending on what he did or didn't turn up, he was going to alienate half the country. Under Smith, these young men had been united in their disdain for the independent counsel's law, and Starr himself had helped prepare a legal brief arguing that it was unconstitutional, placing too much unchecked power in one person.
"When I heard Ken had taken the job," McConnell says, "I sent him a note: 'I guess if someone has to do an unconstitutional deed, it has to be you.' "
Starr's friends had different theories on why he accepted. Olson saw it as a personality thing: "Ken has a hard time saying no to people." Habicht thought religion was a factor: "Reading between the lines, I think Ken believed that since God had put him in all these lofty posts, he had a duty to use his experience when a public-service challenge arose."
Still others saw Starr's choice as a career decision by a man who had lost some of his taste for corporate law. "He missed the public sector," says Thomas Yannucci, a senior partner who is close to Starr at Kirkland & Ellis, a 500-lawyer firm. "He told me one day in the office -- we were working on a case together -- that corporate law was such a change, he liked it, but it was not the same as being off with the American mission in Russia helping draw up that country's first Constitution."
Friends also say that he wanted to be back in the public spotlight. Anyone who has seen Starr work a room would swear he's running for something. At the A.B.A. convention in Toronto, he attended a prayer breakfast in addition to delivering his speech, and at each event he roved the banquet hall, shaking hundreds of hands, hugging women, signing autographs, posing for photos. "He's really eating this up, isn't he?" one A.B.A staff member said. After Elizabeth Dole's speech at the prayer breakfast, several people came up to Starr and said, "God bless you -- keep up the good work."
There is probably some truth in all these motivations -- that Starr had no love for Clinton, felt a civic and religious duty, was bored in his law job, missed the attention, had trouble saying no. Yet no single explanation seems sufficient. If he was part of a vast right-wing conspiracy devoted to nailing the President, why did he try to leave the independent counsel's job in 1997 for the life of a dean at Pepperdine University? And if he was so rabid, why did he work at the prosecutor's job only part time, continuing his private practice at Kirkland?
Hardin, the former prosecutor in the independent counsel's office, says that in 1994, Starr did not have a clue what he was taking on. "He thought he could parachute in, do it in a year or two, not consume his whole life and get out. He misjudged. He'd never been in the national spotlight. He still thought like an appellate lawyer -- that cases would be decided on their merits."
Kenneth Winston Starr was Born july 21, 1946, in Vernon, Tex., the youngest of three children. His father, Willie Douglas Starr, a fundamentalist minister and a barber, put in long, hard hours to support the family. From the beginning, religion was central to the boy's life. "He's gone to church ever since he was 2 weeks old and never known any different," says his mother, Vannie, who is 91. "We just started him from babyhood to know right from wrong." When Kenneth was in fifth grade, the Starrs moved to a white frame house shaded by ash and pecan trees in a working-class section of San Antonio, where Vannie Starr still lives.
Starr's friends from his teen-age days remember him as bright, bookish, religious, a little nerdy, totally unathletic but popular, mature and focused beyond his years. Sam Millsap, who went to junior high with Starr, lived nearby and, like Starr, was raised in the Church of Christ. There was no drinking, smoking, dancing, no musical instruments in church, but a lot of Bible verse. "If it was fun, you couldn't do it," Millsap says. "We were told -- Sunday morning, Sunday night, Wednesday night -- almost everything fun was wrong and we were going to hell because we were sinners." Millsap, who went on to become the District Attorney of San Antonio, says, "When I got older I switched to the Methodist Church so I'd have a shot at heaven." Starr attends an evangelical Bible church.
"In retrospect," Millsap says, "as I piece together Starr, the thing at the core of everything is his church faith. Ken was always independent and sure of himself, his ability and his beliefs of what's right and what's wrong. He was following his own light -- he didn't give a hoot about the group. When we were in church as kids, we knew we were out of step with the mainstream, because we believed what others didn't and we understood we could be subject to persecution -- it was part of the yoke that made us special."
The other thing that school friends like Gary O. Smith remember was Starr's passion for politics. At Sam Houston High, besides being a member of the drama club and the yearbook and newspaper staffs, Starr was president of the junior and senior classes. As a ninth grader in 1960, he passed out campaign literature for Richard Nixon; as a senior, for Barry Goldwater. After graduating, he spent two years at Harding College, a Church of Christ school in Arkansas, selling Bibles door to door to help pay his tuition.
But if there is one thing that has struck people who have known Starr well, both in Texas and Washington, it is his ability to grow. He wanted an Eastern education. He wanted to see how he stacked up against different people. He wanted to see how far he could go. For his junior year, he transferred to George Washington University. He did stick out a little there; while classmates were protesting the Vietnam War in tie-dyed shirts, Starr wore a tie to lectures. But like most of his classmates, he did not go to Vietnam, classified 4-F thanks to a case of psoriasis. The summer he graduated, he met Alice Mendell, a Jewish girl from Mamaroneck, N.Y., and Skidmore College. They were wed by a Church of Christ minister and have been married 28 years. It was Alice, friends say, who taught the minister's son to dance.
After getting a law degree at Duke, Starr was selected in the mid-1970's for a clerkship with Chief Justice Warren Burger. It was the first of many times he would advance his career by ably serving an older, conservative Republican. In 1982, when Starr was Attorney General Smith's chief of staff, a profile in American Lawyer magazine described the 35-year-old Starr as the perfect assistant, "deferential without being obsequious, intelligent without being intimidating. . .anything but one of those arrogant aides who strut the corridors of Washington." Indeed, Jacob Stein, one of Monica Lewinsky's lawyers, noticed some of those same traits during his negotiations with Starr over which sexual acts his client might testify to. "Ken Starr has the manners of a Southern gentleman," says the 73-year-old Stein, "beautiful manners."
He is also a workaholic of mythic proportions, even by Washington standards. "Ken's smart, but he's not a genius," his friend Tex Lezar says. "He's not this person with a 195 I.Q. He got where he is by working very, very hard."
Henry Habicht remembers that at the Justice Department in the early 80's he would be in Starr's office at 8:30 P.M. discussing an issue
as Starr changed into a tuxedo for a black-tie event. "He'd come back to the office after the affair," Habicht says, "pick up work to take home, then be in at 7 the next day."
Often Starr had to learn as he went. He became an Appeals Court judge in 1983, though he had never been a lower court judge; the Solicitor General -- the Government's lawyer to the Supreme Court -- in 1989, though he had never argued before the Supreme Court; the independent counsel in 1994, though he had never been a prosecutor.
An interviewer once asked Alice Starr what she and her husband did for fun and she said that on Sundays they took car rides in the country: she drove while he read.
He has put in the same endless hours juggling the independent counsel's job with private practice. Starr was so busy flying around the country for those two jobs, plus making speeches and teaching a course at New York University, that when John Bates, a deputy prosecutor from 1995 to 1997, wanted to discuss the Clinton investigation, he sometimes had to ride with Starr in a taxi to the airport. Most profiles have portrayed Starr as a career man who still manages to coach his daughter's softball team and teach Sunday school, although friends say it has been years since he has been able to do those things. "He's a good father for a workaholic," one friend says.
It is Alice who is "so brilliant about organizing their lives so he has family time," Bates says. During Starr's breakfast appearance at the A.B.A in August, as he shook every hand in sight, Alice slipped off, filled a plate with food, quietly set it on the table in front of his chair, then went back to get him juice. She is also an executive in a real-estate firm.
While McLean is an upscale suburb, the Starrs live in the same four-bedroom brick-and-frame house they bought 21 years ago when he was a young lawyer, a comfortable home but not lavish. They are known as gracious hosts. Virtually everyone I spoke to for this article -- seven former prosecutors, Starr's law partners, his friends from the Solictor General and Attorney General years -- has been a guest in their home more than once.
In his most recent financial-disclosure statement, filed for 1996, Starr lists a salary of $1.14 million and assets of $3.8 million to $7.9 million. (Federal forms are vague, requiring that assets be listed as a range, and it is possible that his worth is higher, since one trust is in the top category of "over $1 million.")
His three children are used to having his work life mixed into their family time. When Eric Jaso applied for a job as a prosecutor in Starr's office three years ago, Starr suggested that they meet for an interview in Princeton, where Jaso was working on a case. "I'm waiting in a hotel lobby," Jaso remembers, "and all of a sudden this man rushes up and says: 'Eric? Ken Starr. Sorry I'm late, but we're in the middle of a tour of the campus. Come join us.' And we go out front and there's this wood-paneled minivan and inside are his two daughters, his son" -- the prospective freshman -- "his wife, plus two Princeton undergrads conducting the tour, and he says, 'Hop in,' and I sit in the back near his littlest daughter." Jaso took the walking tour of the Princeton campus with the entire Starr family. "He and I hung back so he could interview me," Jaso says. "And then all of us went to lunch."
Two years ago, Starr's wife gave him a 50th-birthday party, and one of the speakers roasting him was their son, Randall, the oldest child, who recalled how his father tortured them on family trips by playing tapes of famous historical speeches. Habicht remembers Starr testing Carolyn, the middle child, when she was 5 or 6 to see if she could name the Presidents in order. Today, Randall is an undergraduate at Duke and Carolyn is beginning her freshman year at Stanford, a year behind Chelsea Clinton.
In Washington if you say "tin ear," people instantly understand that you're talking "Ken Starr" and his lapses of political common sense. Starr's friends have known this about him since he first entered public life 20 years ago, though it has pained them to watch it so nakedly played out before the world. After the Pepperdine mess in February 1997 -- when he announced that he was leaving the investigation for academia, then changed his mind a few days later because of an uproar from the press and his prosecutors -- several friends wrote notes of support. Bob McConnell, who is known as a kidder, was warned that this one was too sensitive for jokes: "My wife said, 'Now you didn't make some wise-guy remark to Ken, did you?"'
McConnell and Lezar recall Starr's lack of political savvy during the Sandra Day O'Connor confirmation hearings in 1981. Starr had written a confidential report for the Attorney General on O'Connor's abortion views, which the most conservative Senators on the Judiciary Committee would have loved to see. He had also helped coach her on how to avoid being pinned down on the issue during the hearings. At a staff meeting with the Attorney General, Starr mentioned that he had been so involved prepping O'Connor that he wanted to attend the hearings. Several people explained that he couldn't, that if the Senators spotted him, they would go after the "Starr Report," the reporters would swarm and the next day's headlines would be about abortion, not O'Connor. McConnell recalls: "Ken said: 'Well I want to go. I spent all this time on it, I don't want to watch it on TV. They don't care about me.' " And then, McConnell says, Starr looked around the room, saw the expressions on the faces of Attorney General Smith and Deputy Attorney General Edward Schmults and that ended it. He watched the hearings on TV.
Starr's tin ear is partly a matter of being more book smart than streetwise. In 1989, after his confirmation hearing, for the Solicitor General's job, Starr called McConnell to ask how he had come across.
"I said, 'Everything's going to be fine,"' remembers McConnell, who was impressed. "Ken said: 'Really? I watched myself on CNN and I must tell you, I thought I sounded pedantic.' "
"Ken, you are pedantic," McConnell said.
"I am?"
"Of course you are," McConnell said.
While Solicitor General, Starr organized a half-day seminar in the Justice Department's Great Hall commemorating the 100th anniversary of William Howard Taft's appointment as Solicitor General. Starr was quite excited, had programs printed, arranged for several speeches in praise of Taft, contacted Taft family members. "Among the lawyers on the staff, this was a subject of immense lunchroom talk," says Thomas Merrill, one of Starr's former deputies. To some it seemed a too-obvious sign of his ambition: Ken Starr paying homage to the former Solicitor General who went on to be President and then Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. To others it just seemed goofy: William Howard Taft Day?
In short, Starr has never had a great sense of how he appears to others. It has been one of the harshest criticisms of him as independent counsel. Rather than acting as an independent counsel, he has repeatedly entangled himself with anti-Clinton forces, making himself appear highly partisan. One example among many: Starr's public appearance a month before the 1996 Presidential election with Pat Robertson, the Christian-right leader and vicious Clinton critic, at a celebration of the 10th anniversary of the founding of Robertson's law school.
Why didn't Starr see his own potential conflicts of interest? His assistant prosecutors did. Several told me they wish that when he became independent counsel he had taken a leave from his law firm and from representing clients like tobacco companies, which had a stake in seeing the President weakened politically. But Starr's aides didn't tell him this. "He doesn't take criticism of his motives well," one colleague says.
Friends say Starr is so sure he's a fair person, and works such backbreaking hours to come to the right answers, that he can't conceive of people questioning his ethics. "He expects everyone to apply a legal standard to things," says Yannucci of Kirkland & Ellis. For Starr, the fact that his speech at Pat Robertson's law school had nothing to do with the investigation was the crucial point, not the appearance of his honoring Robertson the Clinton-hater. (Indeed, Starr's speech, on the future of the judiciary, was so dull and academic that reporters had trouble finding a usable quote.) "He thinks, Why should he be deprived of the right to speak at Pat Robertson's university?" Yannucci says. "He sees it like a First Amendment issue. He thinks, 'I speak at all kinds of places.' And intellectually what he thinks is correct, but politically it does not always wash."
He has more of a judge's mind-set than a politician's, Yannucci says.
"You know what my wife says about Ken?" Lezar says. "He's very judgy."
Starr didn't want to be just a Supreme Court Justice, friends say, he wanted to be Chief Justice. Even as a young man "he carried himself very much in a judicial manner," McConnell says. "I kidded him. He was always trying to be thoughtful, deliberate."
In 1983, Attorney General Smith arranged Starr's nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Starr was 36, and because Administration officials worried he might seem too young, they delayed submitting his name to the Senate for several weeks, until his 37th birthday.
During his six years on that Appeals Court, Starr was as happy as friends have seen him. He loved being away from politics, immersed in law and constitutional issues. His clerks would provide summary memos on briefs in a case, then discover he had read the entire set of briefs anyway. Though he was conservative, voting a large percentage of the time with his fellow judge Robert Bork (against affirmative action, against Federal intervention to guarantee minimal prison standards), he had an independent streak that pleased civil libertarians. He ruled for The Washington Post in a major libel case, for an artist whose subway mural had lampooned President Reagan, for a Jewish military chaplain who wanted to wear a skullcap with his uniform.
In January 1989, President Bush asked Starr to be Solicitor General. It was an honor and, for someone whose goal was to be a Supreme Court Justice, a political minefield. For days, he spent long stretches in his office, door closed, on the phone to friends. "He was very conflicted," Lezar recalls.
Starr had watched President Reagan's first Solicitor General, Rex Lee, attacked from the right for not being aggressive enough in challenging Roe v. Wade and from the left for being too aggressive. "Ken recognized if he took it, there was a good chance he'd never get back to the appellate bench, never make it to the Supreme Court, because he'd make too many political enemies," Lezar says. "But he understood that reaching the Supreme Court is kind of like lightning striking, it's out of your control."
Starr was trapped. If he said no, he risked alienating the very President who would select the next Justice. But in taking the job, Lezar says, Starr still hoped the call would come someday. "I don't think he ever completely gave it up. It's like a Senator who wants to be President. At some point, time passes you by and you know intellectually that it won't happen, but in your heart you don't give up."
A good Solicitor General strikes a delicate balance, primarily arguing the agenda of the President who nominated him but, when the law demands, saying no to the President. Starr's predecessor as Solicitor General, Charles Fried, is widely regarded as having been too much a political lackey of the Reagan Administration; Starr is credited with restoring a proper balance.
On his first tough case, a request from the White House to write an amicus brief for military contractors in a dispute with whistle-blowers, Starr sided with the whistle-blowers and against President Bush. "He held endless meetings with all the parties involved," Merrill, his former deputy, says. "Starr sat there like a judge, hearing everyone out, very courtly -- if anything, excessively judicious. I kept wishing he'd throw everyone out of his office and decide. He took so long making up his mind to do the right thing -- but he did."
Members of the staff were impressed by Starr's preparation rituals for cases he was to argue before the Court. Fried used to go around the room bouncing ideas off aides; Starr would get all his deputies and assistants together and do two moot court rehearsals, plus videotape himself and then study the tapes.
For the Nancy Cruzan case, which involved the question of whether a feeding tube should be removed from a comatose woman, Starr visited Walter Reed Hospital to talk to doctors and observe similar patients. "He agonized," Merrill says. "He said, 'Tom, let's go for a walk,' and we walked along the Mall trying to come to peace on our position." Part of the Solicitor General's job is providing guidance for the Court. And the legal standard Starr argued in Cruzan -- that a person has a right to die by refusing life support as long as there is "clear and convincing evidence" that this was the person's wish -- was the reasoning the Court adopted.
While he argued several cases involving moral issues -- including a Bush Administration challenge to Roe v. Wade -- his deputies say he did not discuss his religious or moral views. Prosecutors in the independent counsel's office say the same. Although he sings hymns on his morning jog and keeps a calendar with daily Scripture verses at his private residence, he did not bring his religion into the workplace, they say.
The main criticism of Starr as Solicitor General was also expressed later at the independent counsel's office: that he was involved in too many outside activities, spread too thin, constantly touring the country, advancing his name in legal circles. Merrill says that Starr could be gone a couple of days a week, "off delivering some ridiculous speech to a bar association in Tucson." He would send back legal briefs for his deputies, full of little yellow stickers they called Ken-grams. "I questioned these road shows," Merrill says. "He'd make some dry legal speech and then go around the room meeting and greeting as many lawyers as he could. I don't know why he bothered -- maybe he felt like he was building a base for the Supreme Court." Starr's assistants could tell that possibility was never too far out of his mind. If they were working a controversial case, he'd joke, "This will do me in for the Supreme Court for sure."
In July 1990, Justice William Brennan announced his retirement. Press reports said that Starr was on the short list of nominees. But by then, as he feared, he had alienated too many constituencies. The Bush White House was upset about the whistle-blower case. Senate liberals felt he had been too aggressive arguing a challenge to Roe v. Wade.
Robert Shapiro, a Deputy Solicitor General, was with Starr in his office when they heard the news. "The announcement that it was Souter came on TV over CNN," Shapiro says. "I looked at his face for signs of disappointment. We all knew how he felt. There was nothing. Nothing. Not a single indication of any emotion. Not one."
Starr's greatest legal strength as independent counsel would be his appellate skill. By the time he departed as Solicitor General, after Bush's defeat in 1992, his experience arguing before the Supreme Court made him the most-sought-after appellate lawyer in Washington.
Since taking the independent counsel post, he has personally argued several key appeals, writing and editing his own briefs. To prepare for an appeal in the James and Susan McDougal case, Starr took a conference room at the Adam's Mark Hotel in St. Louis. From 9 in the morning until 10 at night, the staff briefed Starr on an issue and he went up to his room, studied and came back to do the next issue. "He could absorb so much so quickly," says Jaso, an assistant from 1995 to 1997. When he argued the appeals case on whether the Secret Service should testify in the Lewinsky matter, he deftly led the judges away from peripheral issues with comments like, "I don't think this needs to detain the court," and they followed his prods.
On the other hand, Starr's biggest weakness is never having been a prosecutor or trial lawyer. His predecessor, Robert Fiske, the former U.S. Attorney in Manhattan, had served in both capacities and impressed the staff with his quickness and self-confidence in making decisions. Fiske consulted his deputies, then made the call himself; Starr held lengthy meetings day after day with every assistant in the office, trying to forge a consensus. His former assistants say he rarely took the lead in trial or investigative matters. Harold Ickes, the former Clinton aide who was called before the Lewinsky grand jury five times, says, "Starr was never in there -- in fact, I've never seen him in person."
Starr's role in the case against Gov. Jim Guy Tucker and the McDougals for misusing $3 million in Government loans was typical of his limited involvement in front-line prosecutions. His staff was divided over whether to include Tucker in the indictment. Starr's meetings in Little Rock went on for days, often lasting until late at night. Assistants in Washington were crowded in a conference room, listening by speakerphone. Every prosecutor, from youngest to most experienced, weighed in, usually several times. Starr "asked questions occasionally, but didn't say much," Jaso says. "At some point there was a vote. Starr did not vote. He was the judge. In my time, I can't think of an instance when Starr overruled the consensus. He relied heavily on the career prosecutors' recommendations."
As the trial approached in the spring of 1996, Starr's staff discussed whether he should attend. They decided against it, since they didn't want it to appear that the Government was ganging up against the Arkansas defendants. But there were other reasons for Starr to stay away. "Ken had no substantive contribution to make in court," Jaso says. "He would have had to sit in at the trial and do nothing for two to three months. Ray Jahn was the lead prosecutor in the case. Ken deferred to Ray in any decision regarding litigation of the case."
During the three-month trial, when Starr was in Little Rock, he stayed in the prosecutors' office on the outskirts of the city. At lunch breaks and day's end, someone from the staff drove out from the courthouse and briefed him. "We used to joke about Ken having to stay in his cage," Jaso says. Amy St. Eve, another prosecutor, sometimes brought him a banana.
On the afternoon that the Little Rock jury returned with a verdict, Starr was in Washington. He and his staff hurried into the conference room. As the verdicts were reported -- guilty on virtually every count -- the Washington staff let out a cheer. "There were whoops on Jim McDougal, whoops on Susan McDougal," Jaso says. "The biggest whoop was for Governor Tucker, the hardest conviction to get." Starr embraced several of them. Then they discussed what to say to the press. "We talked about how we couldn't seem like we were celebrating," Jaso says. "Ken wasn't going to gloat." They decided to go to the news conference in shirt sleeves, so they would look like working prosecutors.
A week later, the staff gathered at a North Little Rock restaurant to celebrate. Debbie Gershman, an aide, took a photo of several prosecutors with their victory cigars -- Jaso, Jackie Bennett, St. Eve, Rod Rosenstein and Starr.
Starr's cigar was not lit.
Another prosecutor -- say a streetwise one who lit his cigar and had spent a career fighting serious crime -- might have formed a different perspective on a President who lied about sex in a dismissed civil suit. Another prosecutor could have ended the Lewinsky inquiry long ago. James McKay, the independent counsel who decided not to pursue a trial for Attorney General Meese, says that not prosecuting is one of the hardest decisions a prosecutor makes.
Even within Starr's own office, there was dissent among seasoned prosecutors over how hard to pursue the Lewinsky investigation. Two of Starr's assistants, Michael Emmick and Bruce Udolf, argued for accepting Lewinsky's first proffer in January, then running a swift investigation and turning a report over to Congress in 60 days. In typical Starr fashion, these issues were debated endlessly. Over time, Starr sided with other assistants -- two of his deputies, Robert Bittman, whom Starr affectionately calls Bulldog, and Jackie Bennett, known among fellow prosecutors as the office expert on the President's sex life long before anyone had heard of Monica Lewinsky. Ultimately, Starr opted for an investigation that would turn up every last fact. He fought up to the Supreme Court to get the Secret Servicemen to testify, up to the Supreme Court trying to get hold of the notes of the lawyer for the late Vince Foster; Starr pushed normal prosecutorial practices to the limit by calling Lewinsky's mother before the grand jury.
Starr had changed. At some point, the reserved appellate lawyer decided he would do whatever it took within the limits of the law to squeeze people for his investigations. He had come to realize that the White House was going to do what defense lawyers almost always do during criminal investigations: delay, stall, buy time. What was the turning point for Starr? When Hillary Clinton's billing records suddenly reappeared? When, for the first time in his life, Starr saw close up the stakes in a criminal trial like McDougal-Tucker? When he realized he couldn't escape to Pepperdine? His assistant prosecutors cannot pinpoint it, and who knows if even Starr can. This much is clear: By the time Monica Lewinsky appeared on the scene, he was poised for an all-out assault. As to whether he was overzealous and irresponsible, as Abner Mikva charges, or was simply becoming a prosecutor, as Rusty Hardin believes -- that will depend on what is in his final report.
What we do know is that Starr was willing to drive on when so many other prosecutors would have stopped.
Part of the reason is Starr's legal temperament. All his professional life,
before reaching a decision he has doggedly pursued every last fact. His friends say it over and over: "Ken is determined that no one will defeat him by outworking him." As Solicitor General, the first case he argued before the Supreme Court was an old-fashioned civil rights matter left over from the Carter era that forced the City of Yonkers to remedy past discrimination by racially balancing its public housing and schools. That couldn't have been a case Starr had much political sympathy for, and yet his aides remember his exhaustive preparation. When he lost, says Robert Shapiro, the former deputy, "Ken took it very hard." He hates to lose.
Starr also has a scholarly, at times pedantic, love for the law and is genuinely offended that anyone, let alone the President of the United States, would denigrate it. In his Atticus Finch speech, Starr warned that the single biggest problem facing lawyers today is "loss of respect for the truth."
While Starr wants to be liked, wants to shake every last hand at that "ridic-ulous" Tucson bar association meeting, he was also raised to have confidence in his beliefs even if most people don't agree. As Millsap, his fellow churchgoer from junior-high days, said, it was part of "the yoke that made us special." A 19 percent approval rating in the polls wasn't going to deter Starr.
As for his career, he had little at stake anymore. When he tried to escape to Pepperdine, he couldn't. His great dream, the Supreme Court, had long passed. His next most likely steps -- academia and corporate law -- are assured no matter how this investigation turns out. Indeed, Yannucci says that Starr, who took an unpaid leave of absence from Kirkland & Ellis in July, plans to return when this is all over. In what may be the understatement of the year, Yannucci says, "Now that he's taken on his public duty, I don't think he has the same view of public service."
Did Starr come to hate the President -- did that drive him, too? The answer is probably yes, although not at first, and not until he felt that the White House was stonewalling. I asked John Bates, the former deputy independent counsel, whether Starr hates Clinton. Bates was quiet a long time and then gave an answer so convoluted that I stopped taking notes. I asked again, Did Starr hate Clinton? "I think Ken is very upset at how personal and political the attacks on him, the office and others in the office have become," he said.
Did moral outrage at Clinton's sexual escapades also fuel Starr's investigation? Lawyers who have sat with him at meetings when these details were discussed say they could tell that Starr was offended. But when asked for a single example, a single comment or outburst, they could not provide one. They answered that it was subtle, in the wrinkle of an eyebrow or a quiet grimace. They had heard his deputies make lewd remarks, but not Starr; he was too professionial for that. We do know that Kenneth Winston Starr was raised to take a hard line against such behavior. When his mother was asked for this article what she wanted Americans to think of her son, she answered, "I want them to think of a man who believes in doing right and a man who does not cheat on his wife, like Clinton has on his wife."
All this said, in the end Starr's motives no longer matter. That is his victory, his measure of vindication. It no longer matters if malicious right-wingers consorted with his office to lay a trap for the President, if prudishness or ambition or even radio waves from outer space drove Ken Starr. The President has admitted misleading the American public. He lied. Through Starr's doggedness, his relentless effort to amass every last fact, he has succeeded in making his investigation about Bill Clinton, not about Ken Starr.
All Clinton's life, the man from Hope has relied on his brains, his charm, his boyishness, his uncanny political instincts, his superhuman energy to squeeze through tight spots. Not this time. This time Starr built such a wall of facts that Clinton had no place to go. On Aug. 17, 1998, at 10 P.M. Eastern Daylight Time, Bill Clinton hit that wall. It was not a pretty sight.
Which is not to say that Starr has scored his total and complete victory. This may or may not turn out to be about obstructing justice, but regardless, it is lots and lots about sex, and no one wins when such private matters are made public. All who became embroiled in the Lewinsky case -- the White House, the press and the prosecutors, too -- dirtied themselves. When Starr needed someone to show the American public that he was acting fairly, he hired the Watergate hero Sam Dash as his ethics adviser. Within Starr's office, Dash is referred to as "our secret weapon." A generation from now, if there is another President who needs investigating, will the special prosecutor of that era hire Ken Starr as his secret weapon? Not likely.
Once Starr drops his report at Congress's door, the nation's attention will be riveted on Clinton. It'll be just the facts. People laughed at Starr when he said it, but it turns out he was right, he did have something in common with Sgt. Joe Friday.
In making the decision on what should be done with Bill Clinton -- drop the matter? censure? impeachment? -- some in Congress will choose along partisan lines, a few will look into their own personal lives, but most will stick their fingers into the wind and check the public opinion polls. The citizenry will decide. Ken Starr has forced Americans to confront every last prurient fact, right down to the Presidential DNA.
There are those who will say that half the marriages in America end in divorce, that if every spouse who lied about sex had to confess on TV, the testimony would fill 500 cable channels for 500 years, that this is a matter between the Clintons and that what Bill Clinton has already publicly admitted to is more than we would ask of any other human being.
And there are those who will say it is shameful for a President with Clinton's history to be arrogant enough to carry on a sexual affair with a 21-year-old right in the White House, lie about it and then take advantage of his good friends and aides by using them to clean up his mess and cover his tracks.
Both conclusions are right, of course, and thanks to Starr, during this era of relative peace and prosperity some very painful divisions will fracture the body politic before the matter is put to rest. This touches feelings that people don't normally discuss in polite company, for fear they will get too angry, and lose friends.

HEADLINE: Q&A/Joy G. Dryfoos;
Charting a Safe Course for Adolescence

BYLINE: By DONNA GREENE 

 BODY:
AT 72, Joy G. Dryfoos, a longtime resident of Hastings-on-Hudson, still remembers her own crisis of identity as an adolescent. Years later, she watched her son as a teen-ager and wondered how he -- and the family -- would survive it. But they did.
Not every teen-ager and the family are so fortunate -- and Ms. Dryfoos, a self-taught sociologist, has spent more than 17 years trying to change that. She was director of research for the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit research and educational organization in Manhattan, until 1981. An independent researcher for the Carnegie Corporation foundation, she is the author of four books and about 100 articles dealing with those issues. Her most recent book is "Safe Passages: Making It Through Adolescence in a Risky Society" (Oxford University Press). 
 Ms. Dryfoos's work has drawn the attention of the Westchester Children's Association and the Westchester Council on Crime and Delinquency, which have collaborated with her to form the Westchester Center for School/Community Partnership, which is trying to establish full-service community schools where children and adults can go not only for school but also a myriad of social and health needs. Here are excerpts from a recent conversation with Ms. Dryfoos:
 
Q. Is it harder to be an adolescent today than when you were one?
A. I thought it was pretty hard to be one when I was one, and that was a long time ago. But probably for different reasons. I remember very well and have written about my own sort of identify crisis, knowing who I was and what I wanted to be. I don't think that has changed very much.
But there are a couple of big differences now. One of them is if you have sex without protection you can die. The other is guns. That was certainly not true when I was growing up. And a lot of the drugs have become much more sophisticated and much more available. So there is more risk, but that doesn't mean there wasn't any when I was growing up.
If you talk to people my age, everyone has a story about terrible parents, terrible problems. Things like sexual abuse have been going on for a long time. So I think you can overstate it if you say these are terrible times for kids and before it was so easy. It was never easy, and particularly it was never easy to be poor. And it was never easy to be black.
And now we have new kinds of challenges -- an increasing Hispanic population with a language barrier. The population is changing quite rapidly.
 
Q. Is there a need to teach parenting skills more?
A. Oh, yes, and I think they have to be taught earlier, and I think there is a pretty good body of research on how to do that. There are many successful programs. That's why I wrote the book "Safe Passages" -- to make the point that we know what to do. There are wonderful parenting programs in some of the schools, for example. There are parent resource rooms and parent educators, and parents themselves become outreach workers. But a busy parent is not going to be able to get to that very easily. But we know, for example, home visiting for young parents and people with young babies is terribly important.
 
Q. So with unlimited resources we could solve the problem?
A. No. We have more resources than any place else in the world. We just don't use them very wisely. And we tend to proliferate programs. Every time anyone sneezes there is a new program instead of stepping back and putting it all together in some way so you have a comprehensive approach to the children and their families.
I start with one premise -- and that may be true of rich kids as well as poor kids -- and that is, Every child must be attached to a responsible adult. If it's not the parent, it has to be someone else.
 
Q. So if a parent is not doing it, find someone else?
A. Yes. Now, once you think of that, you start thinking of the program implications and then you also bring together the school, the community people, the other parents, everybody. And there are a lot of different ways to do that and it is being done in some places, and it's probably the most successful program intervention there it is. Sometime it's a teacher; it can be anyone, a grandfather, an older sister.
 
Q. Describe that ideal school-based community collaboration you are advocating.
A. In the book I call it a "safe passage school" that is open. It was very much based on the Children's Aid Society model in Washington Heights in Manhattan and another in Philadelphia. They're jointly run by a school and a community agency, and in many cases the United Way is involved. So the principal of the school and the coordinator of the community school jointly run the program. It is open from early morning till late at night. There is a parent resource center, and it has a health clinic. All those pieces get put together by different agencies in the community. And it has an innovative curriculum. There would be community services provided, and parents would be encouraged to act as volunteers.
 
Q. Why are we looking to schools to do this?
A. We're not looking for schools to do it all; quite the contrary. What we're looking for are new kinds of institutions, school-community partnerships, where the work is shared between the school and the community agencies. What this does is open up the schools so the community agencies that are out there can come into the schools and have direct contact with the children and their families.
 
Q. So the schools are contributing a physical entity?
A. Yes, that's where the kids are. And the schools need this because they really can't deal with the kinds of problems kids have today. Schools can't educate children who lack human resources, and people who provide human resources are not going to be successful if the children aren't going to get a good education.
 
Q. Are we talking mainly about economically disadvantaged children or all children?
A. My interest is in economically disadvantaged children, and there are plenty of them here in Westchester. But what I find is, People all over are concerned about their kids. So the idea of having schools open after school, for example, is very attractive to everybody because almost everyone works and they don't know what to do with their kids, especially their middle-school kids. But there are the famous latch-key children who are just getting into more and more trouble, and they really need someplace to hang out in the afternoon. So it makes sense for a boys' club or a girls' club to locate right in the school.
A lot of that is happening. Very interesting things are happening all over the country that bring together the community resources that are out there in the schools. You can link together what happens after school and what happens in school. The teachers have to be involved, but then they are very happy to have people from the outside come in -- some of them are volunteers and others professionals -- to really work with the kids so they can catch up.
 
Q. On the other end of the spectrum, we hear of economically advantaged children who get into trouble.
A. I think that is particularly true because of the lack of availability of parents. Some people are working very hard -- the double-income family -- but that means mom is away working long hours, and everyone is working pretty hard to keep up that high standard of living. There is a cost to all of that, and that's why I say I think suburban schools, more privileged areas, are very interested in these ideas as well because parents need to have their children engaged 24 hours a day with somebody -- some responsible adult.
 
Q. You are talking about institutional changes. The book "Reviving Ophelia" suggests that all adolescent girls are potentially at risk of eating disorders and other problems. What do you think?
A. It's almost a different subject. I hesitate to say to parents, Do this, do that. I'm much more comfortable in the policy arena. But my editor at Oxford Press insisted I write a chapter for parents, and I guess one of my resistances was that I felt I wasn't a very good parent when my son was an adolescent. He's now 47, but he definitely was an adolescent and it was definitely difficult. My husband and I had very little confidence that what we were doing was correct. Somehow we lived through it and he grew up and turned into this magnificent human being.
I think when I write about being a good parent and all of that, I trivialize. I don't feel comfortable with it because it's not my natural metier. But the whole thing about communications is really true and keeping the door open, and the same principles that apply to programs -- the need for attachments.
If parents feel they're not being successful with their kids, they should find some other adult who can be. That's not as hard as it sounds. Kids really like adults. They just don't necessarily like their own parents at the moment when the parent is telling them they can't do what they really want.

HEADLINE: Racing Rebounds at Bridgeport Dog Track

BYLINE: By RICHARD WEIZEL 

 BODY:
WHEN the Shoreline Star Greyhound Park and Simulcast Complex closes down for the season next week, dog betting enthusiasts say they will miss it, but know their favorite greyhounds will be back at the starting gates next March.
That's something they didn't know the last time the Bridgeport track closed down, in in November 1996. Bankruptcy proceedings had followed dismal turnouts and revenues, and a criminal investigation into allegations of gaming improprieties by the owner, A. Robert Zeff. At the time, few would have bet on the track's chances of ever holding a live race again. 
 But with fewer kennels and races, a half-year season instead of year-round racing, and a far smaller staff and budget, the track's first season back has been successful enough to look to the future, according to Steve Alford, the general manager.
Mr. Alford said both attendance and revenue were up only slightly from 1996 during the period March 20 through June 30 (the latest date for which figures are available), but expenses have been slashed, from nearly $3.5 million two years ago, to less than $1.9 million.
"When we re-opened in March we said if would could break even we would consider the first season back a success, and that's basically what we've done," said Mr. Alford. "We're getting more people than before with a much tighter overall operation and budget, and we want to begin thinking about turning a profit next year."
The future looks promising enough, he said, to begin planning for next year's season, and to formulating a marketing and advertising strategy for several more years. Mr. Alford said the track is not likely to ever reach the lofty expectations of $120 million -- some predicted more than $200 million -- when it opened nearly three years ago.
At the time, with 600 employees and some of the best kennels in the country, it was hailed as one of the best new dog tracks. It could help save both a dying industry and Connecticut's largest city, some said.
But when the first year's revenues barely went over $14 million -- just a tenth of projections -- more than half of the kennels pulled out bitterly, saying they had suffered severe losses, and accused the track of mismanagement, poor planning and a lack of advertising and promotions.
Mr. Alford agrees the track operators were both naive and arrogant, and did not anticipate how difficult it would be to both draw people -- and get them to wager.
"We made every mistake," he said. "But this time we were devoted to learning from those mistakes, such as opening at the worst time of year -- in the winter -- and expecting people would just come. We had this arrogant attitude that because we were in this tristate market just 50 miles from New York that all we had to do was open the doors and people would flock here."
When live racing resumed in March, expectations were considerably more modest. There were about 1,000 in attendance, and there was much less fanfare than at the original opening when many city and state dignitaries, business leaders and politicians turned out.
But to Mr. Alford it was just as exciting -- in some ways even more so. "Just seeing the dogs back out there on the track is pretty close to a miracle, we've done what everybody told us we never would," Mr. Alford said.
What local and state officials had been counting on the first time around was approval of a nearby waterfront casino, which together with the dog track would create a dynamic gambling duo that would spark the local economy.
But the state legislature rejected the casino proposal, and the dog track was a big disappointment right from the beginning. Live racing was suspended in November, 1995, and the track's owners filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July, 1996. The $30 million track, transformed from a jai alai fronton, was on its way out.
Then, with the onset of a criminal investigation into the relationship between the track's owner, Mr. Zeff, and the former chairman of the State Gaming Board, Francis Muska, stemming from a trip they took together around the time the track was seeking a gaming license, even the most ardent track supporters believed it had been dealt a final, irreparable blow. Mr. Zeff was later fined as a result of the investigation.
But a bankruptcy court judge earlier this year accepted a reorganization plan that allowed live racing to resume from March 20 to Sept. 13. (Under Chapter 11 the operation has been allowed to remain open for dog and horse-racing simulcasts from around the country.)
But can Shoreline make it the second time around?
Greyhound racing has experienced dramatic declines -- both at the state's other track in Plainfield and across the country -- leading to considerable skepticism.
"They can do it, but it's going to be very tough, they're going to have to work hard and do things a lot differently," said George Wandrak, acting executive director of the state's Division of Special Revenue, which oversees gaming operations.
Mr. Wandrak noted that while the state's two Indian casinos in Ledyard and Montville are doing extremely well, wagering at jai alai frontons and dog tracks has steadily and dramatically declined. During the past decade annual revenue at the Plainfield track has fallen from $120 million to about $24 million.
"Generally, what we have found is that whenever any kind of casino opens within 250 miles of a dog track, the track is in trouble, big trouble," said Stanley Flint, coordinator of the American Greyhound Track Operator's Association in Birmingham, Ala.
Because Shoreline is located less than 75 miles from both Foxwoods in Ledyard -- now the world's largest casino -- and the Mohegan Sun, which opened in Montville in 1996, it is facing a double whammy.
But gaming officials said Shoreline can make it if officials keep things, as they have so far, on a smaller scale, and build up slowly.
"I think they probably learned a lot about what they did wrong the first time, and they could have a modest success under the right conditions this time around," said Mr. Wandrak.
Mr. Flint agrees, citing the basic statistics again. "They are within just 50 miles of New York City, and just a few hundred miles from Boston -- right between two of the East Coast's major markets," he said.
Shoreline officials, meanwhile, cite their need to work for their market.
"We know that while we have a potential market of 15 million people within a 50-mile radius," said Mr. Alford, "we have to be very, very aggressive in drawing them in here, and encouraging people to make wagers."
And the who-is-helping-whom balance has reversed. "What's happening with Bridgeport's revival is contagious," Mr. Alford said. "We believe we can very much a part of the city economic recovery."
Dog racing buffs say they're just happy the greyhounds are back on track.
"I've been betting of the dogs for 25 years and I love coming here," said Michael Lucibello of New Haven. "I just hope they find a way to stay open."
Many regular track goers said this time they would bet on it.
"I'm a gambler and I wouldn't have bet a dollar that there would ever be living racing here again," said Steve Harrison, of New York, during a recent night at the track. "This track really is one of the best in the country, and I've seen them all. It looks like this time they really know what they're doing. I would bet now that they'll be around for a long, long time."

HEADLINE: Suit Due On School Financing

BYLINE: By MERRI ROSENBERG 

 BODY:
WHEN the county's schoolchildren return to their classrooms for the new academic year this week, they will be carrying more than new backpacks and supplies. Along with reams of lined paper and pens is their potential, as yet undiminished by difficult courses or unsympathetic teachers.
According to a lawsuit being prepared by the New York Civil Liberties Union, such potential is not realized equally because financing disparities and inequities, based largely on how the the state finances school systems through property values, leads to a significant disparity between students from affluent school districts and those from economically deprived systems. The suit cites 10 districts in the state, Mount Vernon and Yonkers among them. 
 For Mount Vernon and Yonkers, the fact that those districts are in Westchester means that the state formula for allocating aid does not adequately address their economic needs. The districts have traditionally been underfinanced, experts say, because the state school-aid formula is determined by property values, which are relatively high in the county, even though Mount Vernon and Yonkers -- among others -- are predominantly urban school systems with underprivileged students.
The issue of financing inequities is not limited to New York State. On a national level, there are 19 lawsuits in 16 states. Unlike recent cases in Vermont and New Jersey, where the remedy has frequently pitted affluent communities against less well-off neighbors, the N.Y.C.L.U. lawsuit is taking a different approach.
"People have the impression that this is a funding inequity lawsuit," said Donald Shaffer, a lawyer for the N.Y.C.L.U. who has been working on the case for the last few years. "We don't see it as a funding inequity lawsuit, although it is certainly a critical part of our lawsuit.
"There are two legal bases for our case. One is that the education article of the Constitution of the State of New York says that every child is entitled to a 'sound basic' education, and that there are hundreds of thousands of children who are not receiving a 'sound basic' education. The second is that most of those students happen to be minority students, and that the method of administration causes minority students to get fewer resources. Our argument is that the state system is providing an inadequate education and a racially discriminatory education."
The suit will seek a court order to compel the Legislature to find a more equitable system.
"I believe the case has a lot of merit," said Lawrence W. Thomas, a partner in the law firm of Donoghue Thomas Auslander & Drohan, who represents the Yonkers school board. "This is a case that should have been brought a long time ago. The formula is inequitable."
Ellis E. Cousens, president of the Yonkers school board, said: "The district has in fact joined hands with the city of Yonkers to work to eliminate inequity. We've lived with this inequity for many years. On the list of hot issues, this is up there. The proportionate impact on Yonkers is probably greatest within the county, or even the state. There's an ongoing operating portion of funding we don't get and accumulated debt service we have to pay. To the extent that our resources are inadequate, that's the issue."
At a time when pressures are being exerted on all districts to meet more rigorous academic standards, to improve student performance to meet the needs of the workplace and to use up-to-date technology, the issue is becoming significant.
"This has relevance to every taxpayer, every parent and every schoolchild in the state," said Michael Rebell, executive director of the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, a nonprofit advocacy organization, which has brought its own suit against the state on the same issue. "We've made a very clear decision that we want the case to lead to significant reform in the state, educationally and fiscally. We're taking seriously the new Regents standards and the idea of giving a 'sound basic' education to every child.
"This is not about taking from the rich to give to the poor. Every child in the state should have a meaningful opportunity to meet the new state standards. We expect the funding system to be shaken up, and potentially the case could benefit everybody. We don't want to leave anybody out. People ought to start thinking about the resources needed to implement Regents standards and feed that thinking into the remedies we're bringing to the lawsuit."
Mr. Shaffer said: "Our job is to lift education at the bottom, not reduce education at the top. There are many, many ways in which remedies can be instituted without necessarily taking away from districts that have adequate education. We are trying to engage in a public education process so every community understands it has a stake in improving education."

HEADLINE: Banco Popular to Open Site in New Rochelle

BYLINE: By F. ROMALL SMALLS 

DATELINE: NEW ROCHELLE

 BODY:
BANCO POPULAR, the largest bank of Hispanic origin in the United States, is bringing its mass-market popularity and bicultural appeal to Westchester.
Many Hispanic residents here are lauding the opening of a bank branch of the Puerto Rico-based financial institution as a major indicator of their growing significance in suburban New York. 
 Banco Popular has a network of branches in Puerto Rico, the Caribbean, New York City, New Jersey, California, Florida and Texas. And it expects to enter the southern Westchester market this fall.
With deposits of about $1.5 billion on the mainland, Banco Popular and its parent company, Popular Inc., with about $20 billion in assets, is among the 50 largest bank holding companies in the United States.
Although Banco Popular has branches in city and suburban centers of New Jersey, the opening this month of the New Rochelle branch marks the first full-service operation in New York State outside New York City, where there are 29 branches.
After conducting market research, Banco Popular set its sights on New Rochelle, where $500,000 was spent on renovations. "We are thrilled that Banco Popular has decided to locate a branch here in the city," Mayor Timothy C. Idoni said. "The bank is right across from the downtown entertainment site, the New Rochelle Center, and our whole downtown is in the middle of a major revitalization, and we are pleased that they have come here." The New Rochelle Center, a $175 million entertainment complex under construction on the former site of the New Rochelle Mall, is a 425,000-square-foot project, which will contain a multiplex cinema, ice skating rink, small retail stores and two restaurants. It is expected to open next summer.
Mayor Idoni said that more than 12 percent of the city's residents are of Hispanic origin, and their numbers are growing. The largest segment of New Rochelle's Hispanic residents is from Mexico, and Hispanic residents are the fastest growing minority group in the county. In the 1990 census, they represented 10 percent of Westchester's residents.
Jose Antonio Torres, senior vice president and general manager for Banco Popular's offices in New York and New Jersey, said that as a full-service commercial and retail bank it has an advantage in serving the community.
"First, we have a good location," he said. "It is on the corner of the former Chase Bank on Huguenot Avenue. We are improving the site with ATM machines. New Rochelle has a growing Hispanic population, coupled with a strong Afro-American population and a stable small-business cluster.
"We get loyalty from our customers because they find a home in our bank. We are able to relate, and that sets us apart from other banks."
Carlos M. Bernard, president of the Westchester Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and franchise owner of Sir Speedy Printing in Pleasantville, said: "The Hispanic community in Westchester is growing by exponential rates. It is projected that Hispanics will be the majority minority in approximately 2010. There are pockets within Westchester that have Latino communities, which are strong in numbers. These communities have needs that can and should be addressed by a Spanish-speaking bank. The fact that the bank is here means that the Hispanic community has achieved a significant amount of growth that makes it a significant player in both the political and economic sense."
Mr. Bernard said there are about 16,000 Hispanic businesses in the county. He added that Banco Popular's community-oriented services, which provide informational seminars on entrepreneurship and loan preparation, would greatly aid Westchester's Hispanic businesses. "They have been very aggressive," he said.
Banco Popular has helped many Hispanic businessmen obtain franchises like McDonald's over the past few years.
Mr. Torres said: "When it comes to commercial lending, we have been known to do the hand holding that most banks are not willing to do. Many banks are impersonal and volume driven. We are a relationship-driven bank."
Obtaining start-up capital and establishing a positive credit history are key factors for starting a small business, but many black and Hispanic residents find that they are often the hardest things to obtain.
Manuel Duran, owner of Duran Travel Enterprise here, emigrated to New Rochelle from Mexico City about 27 years ago. He said many Spanish-speaking immigrants face an uphill battle when starting a small business because it is hard to get credit. He also said a bank like the 102-year-old Banco Popular will be more sensitive to the needs of people wanting to start a small business.

HEADLINE: Raising Money a Goal At Sarah Lawrence

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

DATELINE: YONKERS

 BODY:
THERE is a joke sometimes told here about Sarah Lawrence College that the prestigious institution has two sets of stationery, one listing its address correctly as the gritty city of Yonkers and the other with its assigned mailing address of Bronxville, an adjacent enclave of expensive Tudor-style houses. The Yonkers address is used for paying taxes and conducting other day-to-day business, the Bronxville address for recruiting and conducting public relations campaigns.
Despite the fact that Yonkers is its governmental jurisdiction, the college uses Bronxville on publications and the Bronxville post office for mail delivery. That notwithstanding, Sarah Lawrence -- which is ranked among the top 40 liberal arts colleges in the United States by U.S. News and World Report -- has earned a distinguished reputation. William Van Duzer Lawrence, a pharmaceutical manufacturer who built the first houses in this area, established the college in 1926 as a tribute to his late wife, Sarah Bates Lawrence, and it admitted only women. It opened its doors to men in 1968, and this week, 1,250 students (only 25 percent of them male, however) returned to the campus. 
 In some ways little has changed here over the years. Many of the stone and stucco college buildings with their slate roofs and gracious entryways date from the days of Mr. Lawrence. The lay of the land -- 40 acres of lushly planted rolling hills -- is also much the same, according to the history books, although a new college sports center just opened on the south end of the campus. Even the walkway covered with wisteria that leads to the president's office looks today the way it looked in photographs of years ago.
But for the first time in 17 years, Sarah Lawrence has a new president -- Dr. Michele Tolela Myers, who became the college's ninth president last month. A social scientist and chairwoman of the American Council of Education, Dr. Myers succeeds Alice Stone Ilchman.
The new president is a petite, gray-haired woman who wears denim dresses and gets her brightly patterned reading glasses from New Mexico. As a transplanted Parisian, she has the style and elan one associates with women from the City of Light. As an educator, she is passionate.
"What defines Sarah Lawrence," said Dr. Myers, 56, who was born in Rabat, Morocco, raised in Paris and educated in the United States, "is its focus on the individual, on releasing the creative spirit."
"My dream has been a place like this," she added, "with its special commitment to pedagogy, the small seminars and one-on-one faculty-student relationships."
She is proud of Sarah Lawrence alumni like the author Alice Walker, the actresses Joanne Woodward and Jane Alexander, the White House political director Rahm Emmanuel and the television commentator Barbara Walters. Also, the author Dani Shapiro, another alumna, just published "Slow Motion," the confessions of a formerly spoiled, alcoholic daughter who discovered another aspect of life when her wealthy parents were involved in a catastrophic accident.
It is a college with no departments because "problems don't come in neat little packages," Dr. Myers said. At this school, dancers take history courses, "all academic fields talk to one another across boundaries" and the life of the mind is idolized.
It is nationally recognized for its academic structure, which combines small seminar classes with individual student-faculty conferences. The college pioneered graduate programs in women's history, health advocacy and human genetics, and it was among the first colleges to integrate the creative and performing arts into the liberal arts curriculum. In choosing students, Thyra L. Briggs, dean of admissions, said the college looks for people "with a passion, because there is no back row in the classrooms here."
She added, "We barely look at S.A.T. scores," explaining that the quality of student writing on entrance essays carries far more weight. Of 2,000 applicants last spring, the college accepted fewer than half. As rich as the college counts itself in its curriculum and staff, it is also an institution of higher learning where the annual tuition, room and board total more than $30,000 a year -- in part because the college has not increased its endowment over the years. Among those who have taught at Sarah Lawrence are the author Grace Paley, the writer and mythologist Joseph Campbell and the writer E. L. Doctorow. With the academic excellence of Sarah Lawrence well established by those who preceded her, Dr. Myers said her role as the latest president will be to upgrade the college's financial standing. Sarah Lawrence's endowment is $35 million. Dr. Myers said her charge is to make that figure $350 million.
Of 40 liberal arts colleges that emphasize undergraduate education and award at least 40 percent of their degrees in the liberal arts, U.S. News and World Report listed Sarah Lawrence 36th. It tied with Occidental College in Los Angeles. Amherst College in Massachusetts topped the list.
Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania and Williams College in Williamstown, Mass., which were second and third, respectively, on the magazine's list, have endowments of about $800 million each. Wellesley in Massachusetts, fourth, has an endowment of about $650 million. The endowment at Amherst is $539.8 million.
Sarah Lawrence was the first liberal arts junior college for women in New York State and one of the first in the United States. It opened with 150 students in October 1928 and was an immediate success despite the start of the Depression a year later. It was accredited as a four-year college in 1931.
Explaining that her job would be to travel and meet with alumni over the next two to three years to raise money, she said, "A lot of people assume we're very wealthy, when we're not at all." 
In many ways, the college dates back to the late 1800's, when Mr. Lawrence, the builder, envisioned a utopian community of artists, writers and other creative people who would leave New York City and move north to Westchester to live together in his well-designed houses. He used the Barbizon in the Fountainebleau forest in France as his model, bought land, hired architects and built Lawrence Park in Yonkers.
By the early 1900's, Mr. Lawrence expanded his dream to another 295 acres that he owned in Yonkers, building Lawrence Park West. In 1917, he built his family home -- a red-brick and half-timber mansion called Westlands, which now serves as the administration building for Sarah Lawrence College.
It is there that Dr. Myers has her office today, with its French doors, massive fireplace, walls lined with bookcases and a large, round oak table, which the new president said reminds her of a "good, old-fashioned kitchen table."
Dr. Myers has a 26-year-old daughter, Erika, who is a teacher, and a 21-year-old son, David, who is a jazz musician and student at Carleton College in Minneapolis. Dr. Myers is separated from her husband, Gail, an author with whom she has written several books. He lives in Oregon.
Dr. Myers comes from Denison University in Granville, Ohio, where she was president. Before that, from 1986 to 1989, she was dean of the undergraduate college at Bryn Mawr in Pennsylvania, where she was also an associate professor of sociology.
She earned her undergraduate degree in political science and economics in 1962 at the Institute of Political Studies in Paris and a master's degree and doctorate in communications studies at the University of Denver in 1966 and '67.

HEADLINE: New Residential District Is Born in Chicago

BYLINE: By JILL SCHACHNER CHANEN 

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
A HANDFUL of developers are creating a new residential neighborhood in a former industrial area of this city, just blocks away from the Loop central business district.
Called the Fulton River District, the area embraces about 10 square blocks. Within the next three years it will have as many as 3,000 units of newly constructed town houses and apartments in low- and high-rise buildings as well as loft conversions, according to current plans. 
 The area is bounded by the north branch of the Chicago River on the east side and the city's wholesale meat and produce market on the southwest side.
Developers are attracted to it because of the availability of relatively large tracts of vacant land so close to the Loop, said Tracy Cross of Tracy Cross & Associates, real estate market analysts in Schaumburg, Ill.
Because developers do not have to raze existing structures for their new projects, prices for newly constructed town houses and apartments are approximately $40 to $50 per square foot less than comparable properties being built in established city neighborhoods like Lincoln Park or Lakeview, Mr. Cross said.
"We would never have been able to afford our place in Lincoln Park," said Beth Wexler, 28, a real estate agent with Jameson Realty Group in Chicago who, with her husband, Michael, bought a 2,200-square-foot town house in Fulton Station, one of the district's new developments. "We paid approximately $150 per square foot. In Lincoln Park we could not have touched this same place for under $200 per square foot."
The construction of the first phase of Fulton Station, which will consist of 24 town houses and 80 apartments in two seven-story buildings, is two-thirds finished, said David W. Ruttenberg, a developer with the Belgravia Group.
Closings on two of the town houses have occurred and more will take place at a rate of one a week. The two apartment buildings also are nearly completed, he said.
Mr. Ruttenberg said he offered all the town houses when he began sales in the spring of 1997, and all of them now are sold. Only 104 of the 174 apartments planned in the total project have been offered for sale so far. Of those, 42 are under sales contract. The town houses range in price from $300,000 to $350,000, while the apartments are priced from $142,000 for a one-bedroom unit to $450,000 for three-bedroom duplex units on the top floors of the mid-rise apartment buildings.
The second phase of the development, which will be the completion of two additional apartment buildings with a total of 96 units, is financed. Construction is slated to begin on the third building this month, with completion scheduled for the fall of 1999. The fourth building should be completed by the winter of 2000.
Mr. Ruttenberg does not intend to expand the development beyond the current plans, in part because of the need to heavily landscape the three-acre parcel of vacant industrial property he is developing, including the creation of two parks to help change the feel of the neighborhood.
"It is necessary to attract the buyers that we want to come here sooner or later," he says.
The Fulton River District still has a distinctly gritty, industrial feel from the presence of working train tracks bisecting the area, numerous abandoned industrial sites and a few remaining working factories, including the Blommer Chocolate Company, which perfumes the area each day with the scent of its product.
At Kinzie Park, a new $120 million development that borders the Chicago River on one side and commuter train tracks on the other, developers plan to build 350 units on a six-acre parcel to create a "garden in the city" effect to attract buyers to their gated community of luxury town houses and apartments. The development will have brick-paved streets, fountains and a landscaped walkway along parts of the property that border the river, said Ronald B. Shipka Sr., president of Enterprise Development Company, which is developing the property in a joint venture with the Habitat Company of Chicago.
Plans for Kinzie Park call for 90 town houses, a 39-story apartment building with 186 units and a seven-story apartment building with 54 units. Sales prices range from $155,000 for a one-bedroom apartment in the high-rise to nearly $1 million for a 4,000-square foot town house bordering the river.
Mr. Shipka and his development partners say they believe that living on or near the Chicago River will soon be considered an amenity for which buyers will be willing to pay more, much as they do for proximity to Lake Michigan. The prices for the riverfront town houses have increased by $150,000 since they first began selling last fall.
IN all, 172 of Kinzie Park's units, including 45 town houses and 46 apartments in the mid-rise building, have been sold. Buyers include young families, professionals who work in the Loop and older married couples moving back to the city after their children have moved out of their suburban homes.
Because the entire project has been financed, according to Mr. Shipka, the entire project is already under construction. The mid-rise apartment building and 45 of the town houses will be completed first, with the closings scheduled for spring. The high-rise building will be completed in the year 2000.
These gated, luxury developments are a far cry from the first projects in the area, said Michael Lerner, president of MCZ Development Corporation, who is credited with starting the development trend in the Fulton River District.
Mr. Lerner began converting timber lofts out of vacant warehouses and other storage buildings in the district three years ago on a hunch. He had seen loft buyers stretch to move to other undeveloped areas. "This area was remote, but it did have the proximity to downtown Chicago," he said. "But the building just stood out there alone. There were no neighborhood amenities or conversions."
His success in selling out the first two projects in the area -- the 112-unit China Club Lofts and the 180-unit Clinton Street Lofts -- convinced him and other developers that the Fulton River District was ripe for more expensive development. Mr. Lerner is now completing the conversion of Randolph Place, the former headquarters of the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad, into a $100 million development of 350 apartments and a mix of commercial uses including a restaurant, spa and convenience store.
All but 10 of the units are sold, he reported.
AS buyers continue to flock to the Fulton River District, other developers are investing in more expensive residential projects. The Levy Organization recently sold almost a third of its vacant 3.3-acre parcel of riverfront property, where the Chicago River branches north, to Bejco Development Corporation, which will build a 38-story apartment building and four riverfront town houses that may be as large as 6,000 square feet each. Bejco's project will be linked to the Levy Organization's planned commercial development of two office buildings.
B. J. Spathies, president of Becjo, said the high-rise would house 140 to 160 apartments, to be sold at an average of $250 per square foot when they go on the market this fall. All the units will face the river, with unobstructed views of downtown Chicago, she said.
Ms. Spathies says she believes the growth of the area can support the prices she plans to charge. "It is a vibrant area," she said. "A lot of funky things are happening there. It also is an alternative to the congestion of Michigan Avenue."
Some buyers also see nothing but a rosy future for the Fulton River District.
Perry S. Good, a single insurance agent, said he bought a two-bedroom apartment at Fulton Station because he believed it would be a good investment. Three years ago, Mr. Good, 34, bought a loft apartment on the east side of the Chicago River in a then-developing neighborhood called River North and "watched the area go crazy."
"I think in two years this area will be more residential than River North." he said. "It will be totally different."

HEADLINE: In the Region/Long Island;
Schools Expanding to Match Growth in Enrollment

BYLINE: By DIANA SHAMAN 

 BODY:
WHEN children attending the Munsey Park and Shelter Rock elementary schools start classes Tuesday, they will be greeted by new classrooms and new upgrades to their buildings.
At Munsey Park, a total of 16 new classrooms have been added, four for kindergarten and the rest for the first and second grades. At Shelter Rock, which, like Munsey Park, is part of the Manhasset Public Schools district, five new classrooms will accommodate the school's sixth-grade pupils. Both additions are the design of Burton, Behrendt & Smith, architects in Patchogue. 
 The construction program is part of a $21.5 million districtwide upgrading of school buildings. Manhasset district voters overwhelmingly approved a bond issue for that amount in a referendum held two years ago.
With the booming economy of recent years and a strong housing market bringing in young families, almost every school district in Nassau and Suffolk is taking similar steps to add space. Two decades ago, many schools were being closed.
In Smithtown, for example, voters approved a $28 million bond issue 18 months ago that will add 47 classrooms to its eight elementary schools by September 1999 to meet a potential growth of 3,000 pupils over the next decade.
The district currently has an enrollment of 8,000. Two middle schools and one high school that had been closed will be reopened over the next five years.
Demand for school projects is such "that we are working on $90 million worth of construction and we are being interviewed for another $130 million worth," said Michael H. Spector, principal in charge at the Spector Group, architects in North Hills.
According to the New York State Education Department, enrollment in Nassau from kindergarten through 12th grade grew to 191,297 in September 1997 from 169,335 in September 1990, a 13 percent rise, with the largest increase -- 17,145 pupils -- occurring at the elementary school level. In Suffolk, the figures for the same period showed a 7.7 percent increase, to 231,418 from 214,840. There was a rise of 18,690 in the number of elementary school children, but a drop of 2,192 in grades 7 to 12.
The numbers of grade-school pupils are expected to continue growing through 2006 before leveling off. "The general picture, particularly in Nassau County and western Suffolk, has been a large increase in the number of elementary-school-age children for the last five to six years," said Lloyd K. Bishop, a planning consultant in Manhattan. "The primary reason is the baby boomer generation."
In the interim, schools are using every nook and cranny for classroom instruction, or are bringing in portable classrooms.
But space is not the only consideration facing school districts where some buildings date back many decades. New technology and new teaching methods are also demanding that major changes be made.
"We are creating different learning environments from the traditional boxes next to each other, and giving children an environment that is fun," said Roger P. Smith, a partner at Burton, Behrendt & Smith, the architects. "We are also designing larger classrooms because of the need for technology."
A $13.8 million renovation and expansion plan for the Amityville school district's Park Avenue elementary school, developed by the Spector Group, "will bring this young people's home away from home up to the year 2000," Mr. Spector said, "with the option based on dollars to hook up whatever technology they need today or three years from now, but with the potential to be competitive. Kids must be given an atmosphere in which to excel." The proposal will be presented to voters at a district referendum on Oct. 13.
Other Spector Group projects include renovations and additions to schools in Great Neck, where voters approved a $28 million bond issue in January. The Hewlett Woodmere district, another example, has already completed an $8.5 million renovation of its Hewlett elementary school and is about to have a demographic study to see what additional work is needed. And in Mineola, a study begun six months ago to see what types of upgrading and additions are needed will be completed shortly.
PLANNERS say that school boards have to plan carefully for the long term, since enrollment figures could fall after leveling off.
"We are at the tail end of the baby boomer generation and the next generation had the fewest number of children," noted Mr. Bishop, the Manhattan planner, "so you could again sit with a lot of extra space in the long term."
But for now, low interest rates, the phasing out of bond debt on past projects and the favorable economy, which has placed voters in a mood to spend on their schools, are all helping to push through bond referendums.
"Given the choice between having an inferior school with a lower tax rate, or a superior school with a higher tax rate, people are willing to pay the higher taxes," said Thomas Conoscenti, an economist and planning consultant with offices in Nesconset.
According to the Long Island Education Coalition, a group of school board, administration, union and other officials, Long Island schools generally enjoy high ratings. Their 1996 survey found that 50 percent of high school seniors graduated with a Regents diploma, compared with an average of 40 percent in the rest of the state. Out of every 100 graduates, 84 go on to higher education compared with 74 in the rest of the state. In 1997, the group reported, 34 of the 200 national Westinghouse scholarship winners came from Long Island.
And house values are strongly tied to school districts, real estate agents say. "If you buy in a good school district, you know the value will be there when you sell," said Ann Pollack, a broker with the Jan Kalman real estate agency in Woodmere.
"Buyers shop for a school district," said Marilyn Larsen, president of Lane Realty in Great Neck. She is handling sales at a North Hills project called Stone Hill, which lies within the Manhasset school district, and another called the Villages at Huntington, which lies within the Half Hollow Hills district in Dix Hills. Both districts have excellent reputations.
At Stone Hill, 60 of 82 houses have sold over the last 18 months, and at the Villages at Huntington 170 out of 248 have sold over the same period, with at least 65 percent of buyers families with school-age children, Mrs. Larsen said.
"One of the reasons we bought here was because of the Manhasset schools," said Lois Herzog, a registered nurse who, with her husband, Richard, a gynecologist, closed on a five-bedroom colonial in Stone Hill in July, moving there from a smaller house in the same school district. Of their four children, two are in elementary school and two are in high school.
"The district has wonderful programs, enriched classes that are very challenging, and our students get into wonderful colleges," added Mrs. Herzog, who is president of the parents' council at the Shelter Rock elementary school.
With a school tax bill for their new houses that is projected to be approximately $6,000 a year, "this is a real bargain when I think of what people spend on private education," she added. "I couldn't ask for a better education for my kids."
The rapid rise in school enrollment has caught some districts by surprise.
"We are experiencing two phenomena," said Mary F. Barter, district superintendent for the Three Village schools, whose district office is in Setauket: "One, the resale of existing homes because of the strong economy, and the influx of children as a consequence of new construction which is going up everywhere and often consists of very large homes." Several housing developments are under construction in the nearby Route 347 corridor.
Current projections are for a 10 percent increase in enrollment by 2007, amounting to 700 additional students, Dr. Barter said, adding, "We knew we were going to experience growth, but we thought it would occur at a more modest pace." Because of the anticipated demand, the district will present a plan to the community later in the year for additions to its existing buildings. The cost has not yet been established.
In the Half Hollow Hills school district, covering Dix Hills and Melville, a demographic study completed two years ago indicated a leveling off of enrollment over a 10-year period. A more recent study showed enrollment could increase by 3,000 students over the same period, said Kevin N. McGuire, the schools superintendent.
The district is taking an elementary school in Melville that was closed in 1990, and is reopening it in September 1999, adding five classrooms to the existing 25 and generally updating the building, at a cost of $8 million. Burton, Behrendt & Smith is also the architect of that renovation.
"People are investing in new and bigger housing, capital gains changes have been favorable for house sales, and interest rates are low, and all that happened at the same time," Dr. McGuire said.
"It's been good for the economy and it's been good for the country," he said, "but it's created some problems for us."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/The Reuters Building at Times Square;
A Corporate Headquarters Next to Bugs and Mickey

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
AS the next addition to the revival of Times Square, the Reuters building on the blockfront between 42d and 43d Streets on Seventh Avenue faces an unusual design challenge. It is intended to blend the dignity of a major corporate headquarters with a location that has Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse as its immediate neighbors.
The project is a joint venture of Reuters, the international news and financial services company, and the Rudin family, builders and owners of residential and commercial properties in New York City. Various Reuters operations, including a securities trading floor and television studios, will occupy 506,000 square feet of the 855,000-square-foot building, which will have the address of 3 Times Square. 
 "You have to try to satisfy a lot of constituencies in this area," said William C. Rudin, president of Rudin Management Company, the family's leasing and property management subsidiary. He said the building would have the brightly lit signs that are required by the zoning in the area, but said the approach can't be "too glitzy" because of the presence of the Reuters headquarters.
Nevertheless, with a Warner Brothers Studio Store across Seventh Avenue and a Disney store across 42d Street, the neighborhood is not going to be confused with Park Avenue.
Mr. Rudin said that the recent gyrations of the stock market would have no impact on the project. "We have our financing in place and the interest rate is locked in," he said. Prudential Insurance Company, the previous owner of the site, is providing both the construction loan and the 20-year long-term financing and has retained the right to place some signs on 42d Street.
As for the 30 percent of the office space and 80,000 square feet of retail space that still need to be leased, Mr. Rudin said the Times Square market was strong enough to resist stock market fluctuations. "We don't see the New York market being affected," he said. "There is no speculative building in the Times square area. If you build a good product, there will be demand for it."
With demolition of existing buildings at the site just getting under way, Reuters does not expect to move in until the spring of 2001, although some of the retail space may be occupied as much as a year earlier.
The building is being presented as the latest in high-tech, "green" development, although it will apparently not go as far in using environmentally sensitive techniques as the partially erected Conde Nast building at 42d Street and Broadway, which has a 4 Times Square address.
The Conde Nast building has photovoltaic cells, which convert sunlight into electricity without generating pollution, incorporated in the outer wall of the building. The structure, which is being developed by the Durst Organization, also includes two 400 kilowatt fuel cells to provide larger amounts of low pollution power and as a backup in case of a power failure.
Rudin executives say they will not put photovoltaic cells in the building wall but are still studying the economics and environmental consequences of fuel cells. "On photovoltaics, we just don't think the science is there yet," said John J. Gilbert 3d, chief operating officer of Rudin Management. He said the base building had been designed to incorporate fuel cells if studies show them to be cost effective and environmentally benign. "We are looking at everything they did across the street," Mr. Gilbert said.
Those evaluations are made easier because they are using the same firm, Fox & Fowle Architects, that designed the Conde Nast building as well as the same construction manager, Tishman Construction.
R OBERT FOX, a principal of the architectural firm, said energy conserving technologies, such as a facade that lets in natural light while blocking most heat energy, were being emphasized. He said the walls are so efficient -- and the amount of heat generated by people and machines so great -- that the building will not have to be heated, even on cold winter days.
He said both electric and gas-driven cooling units would be installed in the building, with the option of operating each based on electrical rates, which typically peak on weekday afternoons, but fall off at night.
The building was designed with its core structure -- which contains the elevator shafts, stairways and other common elements -- at the center, so that offices can ring the core for greater access to natural sunlight. Mr. Fox said the developers were considering interior lighting that dims as sunlight increases to conserve power usage.
As might be expected from the Rudins, who took an aging, empty office building at 55 Broad Street and transformed it into a high-tech center by installing advanced communications equipment, the Reuters Building will be heavily wired. In addition to electrical power, the building will have optical fiber and advanced copper communications gear plus antennas and satellite dishes on the roof for wireless communication.
There is also provision for future developments. "The amount of riser space in the building is well above the norm," said Glenn J. Elliott, senior vice president at Reuters for real estate, referring to the vertical passages that house the wiring. "We tried to figure out everything we could possibly need, then added 50 percent for the future."
Reuters will have five 750-kilowatt diesel-powered generators on the roof so that it can maintain operations in case of a power failure. Another will be installed to sustain operations of the building itself, with a pad provided for an additional one if needed.
Mr. Rudin said one reason Reuters decided to participate in the development of a new building, rather than rent space in an existing structure, is the freedom it gave the company to customize the design to its needs. For example, the floor that will house the Reuters Instinet subsidiary's trading floor will be 16 feet slab to slab, compared to just under nine feet for other floors.
The trading floor will be the eighth, which will place it above the brightly lit signs that will adorn the building.
Mr. Gilbert said that Reuters also had other reasons for choosing a new building. "Most importantly, it was a cost-saving alternative to a traditional lease position in a rising market," he said. He said being an owner also gave the company "an opportunity to create a brand image for the Reuters name."
Part of the image-creating will be done on a fourth-floor television studio that will be visible from the outside. With the lower part of 1500 Broadway, across Times Square at the northeast corner of 43d Street, being converted to broadcast ABC's "Good Morning America" show, the two studios could easily end up in each other's backdrop.
The original design for the building called for several news zippers, similar to the one across Seventh Avenue at One Times Square. But Mr. Gilbert said the zippers were now out of the picture in favor of full video displays.
THE retail space will be multilevel, including the lower concourse level and the first, second and third floors. Because the building will include an entrance to the Times Square subway station -- relocating it about 75 feet to the west, to where it was in the 1930's -- and a lobby for the office building, there will be less ground- floor retail space available than before demolition.
As a result, the developers say they have decided to try to attract three relatively large retail tenants, so that each will have adequate exposure at street level, rather than replace the gaggle of small stores that were previously there. (These stores operated on leases with six-month cancellation clauses that were invoked in March. All were closed by mid-August.)
"This is a difficult footprint to work with, because of the subway, the loading docks and so forth," Mr. Rudin said. To enlarge the site, the partnership bought a small building and driveway facing on 43d Street. But because the building housed offices for the New Victory Theater and the driveway allowed back-door deliveries to the theater, one of the loading docks in the new building will be for the New Victory. In addition, a new lobby for the theater will be provided at the concourse level on 42d Street.
With construction under way on both sides of Times Square and to the west along 42d Street, Mr. Rudin said the area is clearly re-established as an office location and retail destination. But he noted that the process of renewal had taken a long time. "My father was involved in effort to redevelop Times Square 25 years ago," he said.

HEADLINE: .. and Bringing the Environment Into the Classroom

BYLINE: By KAREN DeMASTERS 

 BODY:

WHO -- Tanya Oznowich, 39, environmental education specialist for the state Department of Environmental Protection.
 
BACKGROUND -- After growing up in Ohio, Ms. Oznowich studied natural interpretation and environmental education at Slippery Rock University. She worked as a naturalist at several parks before coming to the Department of Environmental Protection, where she has specialized in environmental education for the past 10 years. 

ACHIEVEMENT -- She is credited by Environmental Commissioner Robert C. Shinn Jr. with being instrumental in getting the state Board of Education to include the study of the environment in the science requirements developed under the new core curriculum standards. She recently obtained a $30,000 grant from the federal Environmental Protection Agency to help teachers develop environmental curriculum.
 
MS. OZNOWICH'S GOAL -- "I want students to see that everything we do is linked. We sometimes forget we are part of the environment. We benefit from the environment, but we also disturb it and take a lot from it. The minute we are born we become consumers of natural resources and producers of waste. We have to be accountable. That is what the kids who will be making the decisions in the world in the future need to be taught. I don't want the environment to be forgotten."
 
WHAT CLASSES WILL BE LIKE -- "An environmental classroom is going to be a noisy classroom. It used to be teachers did a lot of talking and writing on the board. Now we want to bring kids outdoors or bring outdoors stuff inside. There will be a lot of interaction and a lot of hands-on learning."
 
A SAMPLE LESSON -- Groups of students in grades four to eight can be asked to plan a community on a lake based on what they consider to be priorities, such as stores, schools and ball parks. They have to take into consideration the natural environment based on geology. Then they are told the lakes are connected and the outflow of one is the inflow of the next. They may have to redesign the community and draw up a set of good rules to live by. "Studying the environment is a complicated blend of economics, government, politics, geography and math," Ms. Oznowich said.
 
PICK UP A PENCIL -- Consider a classroom project known as the pencil exercise. Students are asked to consider where the raw materials in a pencil came from, how it was produced, how much energy was used, how it was packaged, how it was transported and marketed and how many times it was handled before it got to the consumer. "It is a simple exercise to remind us of our connections. We all shelter and isolate ourselves. We think we are immune to what is around us, but in fact we are always having an effect on something somewhere else." KAREN DeMASTERS

HEADLINE: At Columbus Circle, A Circuitous Path To Columbus Centre

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
FOR most of this decade, Stephen M. Ross has been staring intently at the development opportunity of a lifetime -- right through the windows of his own office.
Mr. Ross is the chairman and chief executive of the Related Companies, which develops, owns or manages residential, retail and commercial properties worth more than $7 billion in 40 states. But he could not let go of what he saw from his Madison Avenue office, three-quarters of a mile across 59th Street: the hulking New York Coliseum on Columbus Circle. 
 "It's almost been an obsession with him," said his financial partner, William L. Mack.
Mr. Ross interrupted. "Let me ask a question," he said to Mr. Mack. "What's this 'almost'?"
At the end of July, Mr. Ross's obsessive pursuit paid off when companies that he, Mr. Mack and Kenneth A. Himmel control were awarded the Coliseum development site, for which they will pay about $345 million, by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the owner of the property.
To bid successfully for the site, the partners had to be nimble, as the real estate market and project guidelines kept changing. They added a 1,000-seat concert hall and deleted a 60-foot glass globe filled with restaurants; lost a rental apartment tower and gained one of the bluest chips in corporate America as an office tenant.
"Columbus Centre," as it is known (and spelled), is to begin rising in late 1999 or early 2000, after the Coliseum is razed. Although the stock market's volatility last week raised concerns about the future of many major business decisions, Mr. Mack, fresh from a meeting with his partners on Tuesday, said "We're moving full speed ahead."
As planned, the building is to have two 750-foot towers rising from an enormous base, with a total of 2.5 million square feet of space. It will cost about $1.3 billion, including land acquisition.
Within it are to be the headquarters of Time Warner, which the corporation will own as a 650,000-square-foot commercial condominium, plus 100,000 square feet of studios for its Cable News Network and NY1 television news operations.
Jazz at Lincoln Center will have its first permanent home, with a 1,000-seat concert hall, rehearsal studios and classrooms.
There will also be 325,000 square feet of restaurants and stores, a 425-room Mandarin Oriental Hotel, 325 condominium apartments and a 12-screen movie theater. Plus 400 to 600 parking spaces.
And to think -- Mr. Ross's first vision for the site in 1991 was Kmart.
As they described the evolution of Columbus Centre in interviews, the participants emphasized that in some ways, the most difficult task has just begun.
The design must evolve from conceptual renderings into detailed working drawings and then into a steel, glass and concrete solution to the three-dimensional puzzle posed by remarkably varied tenants. David M. Childs, a partner in Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, is working with Elkus/Manfredi Architects on the overall project and with Rafael Vinoly Architects on the Jazz at Lincoln Center hall.
No newcomer to the Coliseum site, Mr. Childs has been designing projects at Columbus Circle for 10 years now, having succeeded Moshe Safdie as the architect for the development team of Boston Properties, headed by Mortimer B. Zuckerman and Edward H. Linde.
In 1985, Boston Properties presented a plan by Mr. Safdie, who is best known for the Habitat housing complex in Montreal. It called for faceted, angular towers rising to 925 feet, with 2.7 million square feet of floor space -- or 18 times the area of the lot, where zoning rules would ordinarily permit a floor-area ratio of 15. Boston Properties was to pay $455 million for the site.
Opponents contended that the M.T.A. had effectively invited developers to ignore zoning constraints by placing a premium on getting the most money for the site. Among the critics was a young Joseph B. Rose, who was then chairman of Community Board 5 and is now chairman of the City Planning Commission.
"None of the ingenuity and gritty determination so evident in its financial dealings were expended on considerations of design or the relation of a future building to its context," Mr. Rose said at the time.
IN 1987, Acting Justice Edward H. Lehner of State Supreme Court declared the sale of the site null and void, saying, "government may not place itself in the position of reaping a cash premium because one of its agencies bestows a zoning benefit upon a developer."
Boston Properties brought in Mr. Childs. The 1988 proposal called for shorter towers, less density and a lower purchase price. Departing from Mr. Safdie's futuristic approach, Mr. Childs sought to evoke the more familiar imagery of twin-towered Central Park West apartment buildings.
Opponents were not placated, however. Boston Properties came back in 1989 with a project of 2.2 million square feet and towers 752 feet tall, also designed by Mr. Childs. This proposal enjoyed greater -- though by no means unanimous -- approbation.
But all the political support in the world could not change the fact that New York's economy had collapsed in the meantime. Nor could it dispose of continuing environmental litigation.
With the Coliseum sitting empty, the M.T.A. began looking in 1991 for operators to take over the hall on an interim basis, so the authority could earn rent while awaiting the closing of the sale to Boston Properties.
Enter Mr. Ross.
He proposed to install Kmart at the Coliseum. "People wanted to bring some activity to the site," Mr. Ross recalled. "The economy was terrible. And we thought it was a good way to create jobs."
Kmart executives toured the building. Discussions advanced as far as which Kmart subsidiary -- a Sports Authority sporting-goods store, a Borders bookstore, a Pace warehouse club -- would go on what floor.
Nothing ultimately came of this proposal, however, and in July 1994, after further attempts at revising the redevelopment project, Boston Properties withdrew.
To the outside world, the next two years looked like a time of little progress, characterized mostly by wrangling between the M.T.A. and the administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani over the future of the site.
But Mr. Ross was not idle.
He reached out to Mr. Himmel, the president of Himmel & Company in Boston, a retail development concern responsible for the Pacific Place complex in Seattle, which is to open this month, and 730 North Michigan Avenue in Chicago, which opened last year. In the 1980's, at the Urban Development and Investment Company, Mr. Himmel developed Copley Place in Boston.
He and Mr. Ross had been friends for about 10 years, having come to know each other through an informal network of developers and investors called the Real Estate Round Table, which typically meets twice a year.
Prospective developers were also approaching Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, given its track record at Columbus Circle. "After Mort and Ed dropped out, we got calls from several people," Mr. Childs said.
One call came from Bruce Macleod, chairman of the buildings and grounds committee at Deerfield Academy, where Skidmore had designed a new pool house known as the Koch Natatorium. Mr. Macleod also happened to be president of the O'Connor Retail Group, which was then affiliated with the Columbus Centre team.
(Mr. Macleod is now executive vice president of the Palladium Company, a retail development concern that is jointly owned by the Related Companies and Mr. Himmel. Palladium will oversee the retail portion of Columbus Centre.)
The team began drawing up the broad outlines of a new project for Columbus Circle, together with Howard F. Elkus of Elkus/Manfredi, the designers of Pacific Place and 730 North Michigan Avenue.
"Office use was not a viable consideration," Mr. Ross said, "but we knew there would be television or movie studios." Mr. Himmel said movie theaters and restaurants were also part of the mix from the outset.
On the governmental front during this period, Mr. Rose, the Planning Commission chairman, said he had "extensive interaction" with Marc V. Shaw, executive director of the M.T.A.
After pushing and pulling between city and state officials, the authority issued a request for proposals in July 1996, with design guidelines largely developed by city planners. "We never were trying to design the building for the architects," said Mr. Rose. "We were trying to incorporate values into the project."
A key guideline is the division of the site by a "view corridor" at least 65 feet wide, centered on the middle of Central Park South. This guideline is to prevent the vista from being walled off. It effectively dictates multiple towers.
The towers can be no higher than 750 feet; for comparison, that is seven feet lower than Carnegie Hall Tower on West 57th Street. The eastern facade of the project must follow, and thereby reinforce, the curve of Columbus Circle.
Although a floor-area ratio of 15 would yield 2.2 million square feet, the guidelines set a limit of 2.1 million square feet. (Because "zoning floor area" allows for certain deductions, chiefly mechanical and below-grade space, the actual gross floor area will be closer to 2.5 million square feet, equal to the Empire State Building.)
In November 1996, Columbus Centre Partners, an alliance between the Related Companies and Himmel & Company, submitted its proposal.
It was to be financed in part by Mr. Mack's company, Apollo Real Estate Advisors, which represents state and corporate pension funds, college endowment funds, financial institutions and wealthy individual investors.
Among the eight other respondents were Daniel Brodsky and Bruce C. Ratner, Millennium Partners, Tishman Speyer Properties and the Trump Organization.
Columbus Centre, as first envisioned, was to have three towers. The north tower would have rental apartments. The southwest tower would have a hotel and condominium apartments. And the southeast tower, shorter and closer to Columbus Circle, would also have condominium apartments.
IN the base, stores were to be arrayed along either side of a broad, curving internal thoroughfare that paralleled the arc of Columbus Circle. That planned layout is still in effect.
As an esthetic piece de resistance, a glass sphere filled with restaurants was to rise above the fourth level of the base building.
Columbus Centre Partners survived the first round of elimination, to finish among five finalists in the spring of 1997. They raised their offer for the site to $262.5 million, from their initial $195 million bid.
That made the land acquisition too expensive to permit the construction of rental apartments. So the team turned to pursuit of an office tenant.
"This was a major turning point," Mr. Mack said. "One thing that won the day was the foresight to say this would work as offices without a tax abatement at a time when no new office buildings were being built in New York."
At the same time, Mayor Giuliani was beginning to press the M.T.A. privately to include a 1,000- to 2,000-seat theater in the project, although it was not yet determined who would operate it.
Word got out in July 1997 that the M.T.A. was on the verge of awarding the project to Millennium Partners, a development team that has transformed the area around Lincoln Center with three large retail and residential projects.
The Mayor threatened to exercise the city's veto in the selection process, in part because there was no theater in the proposal and in part because he said the authority was more concerned about the financial terms of the deal than the longterm benefits of the development.
While city and state officials were fuming at one another, Mr. Ross arranged through a mutual friend in July 1997 to meet Richard D. Parsons, the president of Time Warner, together with Mr. Himmel.
As Mr. Ross recalled that conversation: "We said, 'This isn't about renting space, this is about showcasing your company and making an icon for New York City.' Within the first 10 minutes, he totally understood."
Within 70 days, Mr. Ross said, the Columbus Centre partners had their answer: Time Warner would join the project.
By the fall of 1997, an advisory group convened by the city had met with potential theater users. "It became clear that the most promising operator for this space was Jazz at Lincoln Center," Mr. Rose said, "with the recognition that the space would be versatile and be available for more than jazz."
In March 1998, an addendum was issued to the original request for proposals, stating that it was "in the best interest of the M.T.A., the state and the city that the redevelopment of the site include a state-of-the-art cultural performance and education facility."
Specifically, the facility was to have 100,000 square feet of space for use principally by Jazz at Lincoln Center. The structural core and shell were to be built at the developer's expense and conveyed as a condominium unit to Jazz at Lincoln Center, which would be responsible for finishing, equipping, operating and maintaining the space.
The revised guidelines also incorporated features based on ideas generated by submissions and comments in the first round of submissions. These included a requirement for off-street loading and the integration into the project of the 58th Street subway entrance.
Mr. Ross and his partners submitted their third proposal in April 1998, describing their agreement with Time Warner and incorporating the jazz hall.
On July 28, the Columbus Centre group was designated to develop the site.
In their new plan, the partners have replaced the globe with a sloping glass oculus that would serve as a skylight over a circular atrium. Upper levels might be reached by a new kind of spiral escalator made by the Mitsubishi Electric Corporation.
Jazz at Lincoln Center is to be on the fourth level. The developers estimate it will cost $40 million to $45 million to build the basic structure, but it is not yet known whether the concert hall will take the form of a conventional auditorium with a raked floor or whether it will be more like a very big jazz club. Outside the hall will be an ample lobby leading to a terrace that overlooks Columbus Circle.
"At Avery Fisher Hall or the Met, you come out on the mezzanine and look at a plaza," said T. J. Gottesdiener, a Skidmore partner. "By contrast, here you're going to see Central Park and the Manhattan skyline. The difference will be phenomenal."
Spectacular views and a lively performance venue serve more than a civic purpose. They are meant to draw the public -- the shopping public -- all the way through the building and past the many stores.
"Getting New Yorkers to move through vertical retailing is a challenge," Mr. Himmel conceded. "They've got to have a sense that there is something so exciting up there that they've got to be part of the experience. If this works right, the magic of Jazz at Lincoln Center will draw you to the fourth level."
Although an approximation of the building layout has been drawn up, exact layouts are a long way from being determined. "I bet we'll go through a hundred schemes," Mr. Himmel said.
Mr. Childs is thinking about the tops of the towers. "We'd like to make them as memorable as the Chrysler Building," he said. "They would end in a great crescendo, a sparkle of glass, something of the new century, the new millennium, that explodes in light and crystals."
The lower facade is meant as a showcase for the merchants within. Mr. Himmel acknowledged that Copley Place, with its vast blank exterior walls, left something to be desired urbanistically.
"At the time, there was no choice," he said. "The retail world only viewed itself in the mall vernacular. Everything was inward-focused. Today, retailers express themselves to the outside."
THE only exterior elements of note on the Coliseum, which opened in 1956, are four plaques depicting governmental seals. They were designed by Paul Manship, the sculptor of Rockefeller Center's famous Prometheus. Not much thought has been given yet to the Manship plaques. "Columbus Centre is a large project and there would be a lot of opportunities to reuse them," Mr. Gottesdiener said. "I just don't know if it's the right place. But I'm sure they won't get hit by the wrecking ball."
Demolition of the Coliseum may begin next summer and is expected to last six months. Construction will probably take two and a half years, Mr. Himmel said.
Neighborhood opponents, led by the Committee for Environmentally Sound Development, are gearing up for battle again. Even if it were built on schedule and without lawsuits, however, Columbus Centre would not open until 2002 at the earliest. That is six years after the request for proposals was issued.
Mr. Mack, for one, sees a benefit in the drawn-out process. "The M.T.A. was able to realize a larger amount of money," he said. "The city and state were able to have Jazz at Lincoln Center in the project. And the study produced not only the best esthetic design but the best tenancy mix."
Of course, it is easier for Mr. Mack to take the long view because he has known the site since 1952. As a 12-year-old, he watched as a wrecking company owned by his father, H. Bert Mack, razed office buildings and theaters around Columbus Circle to make way for the Coliseum.
"So he's following his father's footsteps," Mr. Ross said, "in demolishing whatever is on that site."

A Roof Over Some Heads, For at Least a Little Longer

BYLINE: By Jennifer Preston; Jennifer Preston is Trenton bureau chief of The New York Times.

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
Faced with the prospect of 2,200 people becoming homeless this fall and winter, the Whitman administration decided last week that it would not hold fast to its 12-month time limit for some people who depend on the state's emergency housing assistance program.
The time limit was part of the package when New Jersey revamped its welfare program more than a year ago. The new law, which also places a five-year time limit on cash benefits and requires welfare participants to find a job, is credited with helping to produce a stunning reduction in the state's welfare caseload. 
 But with the decision to extend the time limit for housing assistance, the Whitman administration has in effect acknowledged that it might be more difficult than some policy experts first assumed for some of the state's poorest and most vulnerable residents to make it on their own.
"They are mostly disenfranchised from their families and from society," said Bonnie Chehames, director of Human Services in Willingboro, Burlington County, about many of the people who faced the prospect of losing their housing aid. "They tend to be extremely frail."
Under pressure from city and town officials, the Whitman administration agreed to lift the time limit on housing aid for those people whom caseworkers concluded were "unemployable." The state said that it would not end benefits for approximately 2,200 people, mostly childless adults, while it develops a permanent housing solution for them.
Another 637 childless adults have already lost their emergency housing benefits since July 1, state officials said. Caseworkers concluded that, unlike the others, they were physically able to find a job and someplace to live. State officials said they did not believe that any families had lost their housing assistance.
"This is crisis intervention for a handful of municipalities," said Jackie Tencza, spokeswoman for the state Department of Human Services. "The law is working in most of the state."
Why did the New Jersey League of Municipalities and city and town officials fight so hard for the state to continue providing emergency housing assistance benefits to chronically unemployed people, mostly childless adults?
Almost 40 years ago, the state Legislature adopted a bill, commonly known as the "poor law," requiring cities and towns to provide "support and relief" to the indigent.
While county governments, using state and Federal dollars, administer welfare programs to families, the state's cities and towns oversee the state's general assistance program for childless adults. Most of the participants are older men without children who receive monthly cash benefits from $140 to $210.
Because of the poor law, some local officials remain concerned that property taxes could end up paying for subsidized housing for the chronically unemployed unless the state comes up with a solution. There is also concern that the time limit on housing assistance could swell the ranks of the homeless.
"We want to have a permanent solution," said William Dressel, head of the New Jersey League of Municipalities. "We are pleased that the administration is taking this first step. But we are still only talking about a temporary solution."
Mr. Dressel said that the League intended to monitor the situation closely. "We don't want to see anyone slip through the cracks who is deserving of these benefits," he said. "At the same time, we want to make sure that people who are not deserving do not get benefits."
In addition to local government, social service organizations across the state are also beginning to feel the impact of the new welfare law's time limits, particularly on emergency housing aid. Some groups say they are providing services to more people even though the state's statistics show a decline in the number of people depending on welfare benefits and housing assistance.
"We are delighted that the state is acknowledging the lack of affordable housing and deciding to continue emergency assistance benefits for certain people," said Regina Purcell, associate director for social concerns for the New Jersey Catholic Conference. "But the state has to recognize that there are a lot of people coming into shelters that have not received emergency assistance benefits.
"There are more homeless people in our shelters, without state emergency assistance aid, than there are with it," she said. "And shelters, in certain areas of the state, are continuing to turn people away."
Ms. Chehames, the head of the state's Municipal Welfare Association, said she was hopeful that the state will help come up with a permanent housing solution. "Just to drop some of these people and make them homeless is not going to help them or help our communities," she said. "They are not going to go away."

HEADLINE: IN PERSON;
A Small-Town Mayor With Big-Time Dreams

BYLINE: By LAURA MANSNERUS 

DATELINE: WILDWOOD

 BODY:
THERE is much about the headaches of governance that Mayor Fred G. Wager is not at liberty to discuss because, at the moment, he is up to his neck in litigation. He needs to speak carefully. Still, he is steaming mad on behalf of his town, even if his shrug is good-natured when he says: "You want to sue us? Get in line."
Mostly, the problems stem from the casino. The Mayor has spent several years engineering a deal to turn 2.2 acres of municipal parking lot into an Indian-run gaming palace. The land transfer would settle the Delaware tribe's court claim that its ancestral lands, including all of Wildwood, were illegally seized a century and a half ago. But the state, objecting on several grounds, has gone to court to stop the deal. 

 The hostilities do not stop there, either. From the north, politicians from Atlantic County, and particularly State Senator William L. Gormley, have bashed Wildwood's latest attempt at revival. Mr. Gormley, citing the state constitution's prohibition of gambling outside Atlantic City, called the tribe's demands "repugnant," and then got rather personal about the Mayor. "He's an embarrassment to the city," the Senator told The Press of Atlantic City. "He's an embarrassment to municipal officials."
That is a lot of artillery for the Mayor of a place about the size of Bradley Beach and not quite as big as Lopatcong or Harrington Park. Mr. Wager (prounounced WAY-ger, with a hard "g") has 4,442 constituents. His job is classified as part-time, the salary $15,500 a year.
But this town, he says, needs full-time help. "We've got 26 percent unemployment," Mr. Wager said in a recent interview. "Our kids graduate from high school and we have no jobs. We have boarded-up buildings. Thirty-five percent of our children live under the poverty level."
As he spoke, Mr. Wager was sharing the floor with two friends, Bill Gannon, a motel owner, and John Nickels, who runs an entertainment pier. The three took turns describing how Wildwood's tourism operators helped Atlantic City 25 years ago in its lobbying for casino gambling, only to see their own businesses bled as the state Casino Reinvestment Development Corporation poured billions into Atlantic City.
And now, "we're pushing to get a little casino in Wildwood," Mr. Wager said. "We don't want alcohol in it, or hotel rooms. We're a family resort. We want mom and pop here. We're not looking for the high roller. No way in the world would we hurt Atlantic City."
About two years, ago, he said, Governor Whitman's administration made a gesture of help. "They sent 13 people down here from Trenton to see how they could help us, from every agency you could name. In the end, they didn't do a thing. We cried, and they wouldn't wipe away our tears. I even hired a bus to take them around the city." And these were members of his own party. (So is Mr. Gormley, for that matter.) "I'm the ward leader for the Republican Party here," Mr. Wager said. "We're the guys who get the vote out for them."
On Mr. Wager's desk is a photograph of Mayor and Governor, together on the boardwalk. (It looks a little puny next to the picture of Mr. Wager with Attorney General Janet Reno, a Democrat, taken last month at a conference in Washington on economic development for Native Americans.) He has not stopped imploring the Governor for help, even as her administration implores the Federal District Court in Camden to block his casino plan; last week the state, which opposes a casino on several grounds, got a judge's approval to enter the suit.
Mr. Wager's troubles have been compounded recently by reports that the New Jersey Sports and Exhibition Authority is scaling back its plan for a new convention hall in Wildwood. And for good measure, the Mayor has been named a defendant in a lawsuit by a nightclub whose license to hold dances for teen-agers was revoked last year.
But the job is not all litigation and political bickering. The Mayor is also a promoter -- he climbs on a boardwalk tram with a string band every Thursday night, for example -- and a socializer. He reports that he performs more weddings than anyone else in Cape May County. ("Why is that?" he asked, repeating a question. "Because I don't charge.")
Mr. Wager, born in Philadelphia 70 years ago, spent childhood summers in Wildwood and moved here to stay in 1952. He was a salesman, working for, among others, General Foods, but in 1955 he and his wife bought a hotel on Spencer Avenue. It was a family-run business, named the Germantown, that they ran until 1986. "I got up at 6:30, ran out and started selling at 9:30 and came back to help with dinner at 3:00," he recalled.
Mr. Wager's political career began in a moment, or maybe a week, of pique. The immediate cause was the city's removal of a loading-zone sign outside the Germantown. Mr. Wager called his councilman to demand an explanation, leaving a message. He left more messages, and then he went to the next Council meeting.
Facing the councilman, Mr. Wager recounted, "I said, 'I've called you five, six, seven times; could you please give me the courtesy of calling me back?' " When he got no apology, Mr. Wager said, rising from his desk to demonstrate, "I plunked down my business card and said, 'I'm running against you next time.' "
He did, and he lost by 12 votes. On his second try, in 1993, he won, then pushed successfully to change Wildwood's form of government from a council to a board of commissioners. He was elected Mayor (and one of the three commissioners) in 1995. Mr. Wager set out to extend Wildwood's tourist season and, through shows like the monster truck competition and the string band weekend in the fall, to make it "the event capital of South Jersey." The city raised its sales tax to pay for a new convention hall.
But most of all, Mr. Wager wanted a casino. He acknowledges that Wildwood had the idea before the Delaware tribe did; civic leaders plunged into research on Indian gaming that led them to Oklahoma and an agreement with the tribe. In 1995, Wildwood voters approved a referendum creating the tiny reservation.
The state contends that the tribe's lawsuit against Wildwood, filed in March, was a collusive maneuver, and Mr. Wager, while not putting it that way, has only praise for the tribal leaders. "They're wonderful people," he said.
On this hot morning, Mr. Wager offered to show off the blacktopped site near the boardwalk where the casino is supposed to rise. On the way, from behind the wheel of his Celebrity, he pointed out as many of his town's failures as he could spot. "They moved out," he said on the slow drive down Pacific Avenue, "This bank's gone; we don't have a big bank anymore. That store -- they closed." He shook his head at the Germantown Hotel, still open but not, he said, what it used to be.
On the boardwalk, Wildwood looked healthier. There were crowds, and Mr. Wager worked them, calling out to the locals. ("Growin' a beard?" "Dave!" "Eating again?") Passing the municipal restrooms on the beach, he announced: "She does a good job with those bathrooms, that girl. At $6.50 an hour. Sheesh!"
And while looking rather unmayoral as he strode forth in khaki shorts, white socks and black sneakers, Mr. Wager drew many waves. Along the arcades and pizza-stand counters, young men with the general demeanor of bouncers called him "sir." Of his constituents, he said, "I know them all; well, I've been in all their houses."
He stopped to see his wife, Ethel, who works at the Wildwood tourist center. ("We're Fred and Ethel," he said. "We're friends of Lucy and Desi.") Across the boardwalk, he ducked into Mr. Nickels's office and pointed out a chalkboard there that still bore the vote tallies on the casino referendum three years ago.
The rest of the day looked promising. There was an evening party for the police union, and in the afternoon Mr. Wager had to return an important and welcome phone call. It concerned an investor's proposal to open a 10-screen movie theater in Wildwood, which as of this summer is down to none.

HEADLINE: Keep Economics Professors Out of Phone Deregulation

 BODY:

To the Editor:
One grows a little weary of Alfred E. Kahn's efforts to rationalize the mess he made of the airlines (higher fares, inconvenience, delay and reduced safety from extra stops along the way) by trying to force similar advantages on customers of other regulated utilities ("Hung Up," Soapbox, Aug 30). 
 "Deregulating" local telephone service is just plain silly. How can local exchange carriers provide competitors with bulk-rate service priced so low that it can be resold at a profit below what Mr. Kahn says is an already artificially low price because of subsidies from overpriced business customers?
That Mr. Kahn's grasp of the problem is tenuous can be seen from his belief that it costs no more to serve business customers than residential ones. In general, large-business customers use small automatic switches to concentrate their calls from many lines to a much smaller number of trunks to the central office. As a result, trunks carry 8 to 12 calls an hour all day, while residential lines (at least those without Internet access, the vast majority) are seldom used more than five minutes an hour. Thus more switching capacity per line at the central office is required for business customers.
The actual technical problems involved are both interesting and challenging. However, they cannot be solved with principles offered by that most unprincipled group, tenured professors of economics who wish to inflict competition on others, no matter how much it costs or how it degrades service.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: SUNSET PARK;
Anti-Sweatshop Group Targets Sears

BYLINE: By MARCIA BIEDERMAN 

 BODY:
A Sunset Park group that includes children of sweatshop workers is using the Sears store on Bedford Avenue in Flatbush to open a national campaign against the retail chain, which it says sells clothing made under abusive conditions.
Members of the group, the National Mobilization Against Sweatshops, protested in front of the store on Aug. 23 and said they planned to return on Saturdays. 
 "Sears is telling parents to buy clothes for back to school, but parents shouldn't buy clothes made with abuse," said Trinh Duong, a project director at the Brooklyn office of the Chinese Staff and Workers Association, of which the anti-sweatshop group is a part.
The retailer carries girls' apparel made by Street Beat Sportswear, which has been sued by the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund. Ken Kimerling, a lawyer for the fund, said Street Beat relied on a Brooklyn contractor whose employees, he said, worked as many as 137 hours a week and that failed to pay minimum wages. The case is pending in Federal District Court in Brooklyn.
"It's my understanding that Street Beat was no longer providing work to this contractor in question at the time that this issue was being litigated," said a Street Beat spokesman, Gary Lewi.
The Asian American Legal Defense Fund has also sued Hua Great Procetech, the contractor used by Street Beat, in Federal court. The state, meanwhile, has filed criminal and civil charges against Jian Wen Liang, asserting that workers were illegally fired and were not paid. The State Attorney General's office said the Sunset Park factory had closed in late May and apparently relocated under a different name.
Paula Davis, a spokeswoman for Sears, which is not a defendant in the suits, said the retailer had begun an audit of Street Beat and its contractors. She said Sears has been assured by Street Beat that all goods sold to Sears were made in compliance with the law and that none were produced by Hua Great Procetech.
Mr. Liang's lawyer, Alfred Lui, said, "Workers have lied."
Mr. Lui is also president of the Chinese-American Economic Development and Employment Council, which he said organized a counterdemonstration to the recent protest at Sears. The police said there were about 500 counterdemonstrators, more than three times the number of protesters.
The anti-sweatshop group says it plans to keep the pressure on. Heidi Chua, its campaign coordinator, said its mostly English-speaking members hoped to improve factory conditions and help workers who may be afraid to complain. "People are working longer and longer hours," she said. "It's a community issue." MARCIA BIEDERMAN

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS IN TURMOIL: THE OVERVIEW;
A Compass for Those Choppy Seas

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
In reaching stomach-churning, sleep-depriving levels last week, the gyrations of the stock market seemed to restore meaning to an old Wall Street maxim:
 To invest is to choose between eating well or sleeping well.
Some investors, their dreams disturbed, headed for the sidelines. Some, accustomed to filets and refusing to concede that the great bull had snorted its last, rushed in to buy on what they hoped was Monday's 512-point "dip." 
 Most investors, with varying degrees of concern and confusion, probably did nothing, amid gathering worry that a healthy market correction might be turning into the first bear market in 25 years and that the world's economic problems could tip the American economy into recession.
As maxims go, it's hard to beat "First, do no harm." But paralysis in the face of change is another thing entirely.
Whatever your personal circumstances and the condition of your portfolio, financial experts say there are a number of steps that every smart household should at least consider in today's highly unsettled -- and sobering -- environment.
 
Turn Asset Allocation on Its Head
As the market boomed, brokers and other advisers kept cautioning that particular stocks or industries -- perhaps computers or cyberspace -- would inevitably prosper more than others, leaving investors' portfolios overweighted in those areas.
More broadly, with stocks bounding upward at more than 20 percent a year, investors who did nothing but watch could quickly find themselves deeper in equities than they had intended. The remedy, readily dispensed, was to pare back such positions, reinvesting elsewhere to maintain a sensible degree of diversification.
Now, after a downdraft, the opposite may apply. If too small a proportion of your portfolio's value is committed to an area you still favor, the right move would be to bulk up. As Brian Grodman, a financial planner in Manchester, N. H., put it: "This is the time to buy that Dell Computer. It's pure common sense."
Of course, buying a company that is still selling at 52 times its anticipated earnings may not seem sensible to everyone. But if your horizon is long term, your sleep sound and your portfolio skewed by the market's retreat, you might want to raise your exposure to stocks in general.
Abby Joseph Cohen, the indomitably bullish strategist at Goldman, Sachs & Company, increased her recommended stock allotment to 72 percent of assets from 65 percent last week, at the expense of cash and commodities.
Continuing to buy a favored stock as it declines -- when it's "on sale," to an optimist's eye -- is a form of dollar-cost averaging, one of the more sound investment strategies. By putting a specified sum of money into a stock at regular intervals, you get more shares for your money when prices are down. And for any given period, your average cost per share is lower than the stock's average price.
For the strategy to work, however, the company must be strong enough to ultimately prosper. And you must be disciplined enough to persist at times like these, when it may seem dicey to buck the market crowd.
 
Put Your Cash to Better Use
The sleeping-versus-eating test may send many investors in search of the safest havens, rather than in pursuit of reasons for buying more shares. And though Russians may have been driven lately to stash even more money under the mattress, Americans have numerous alternatives if fear or prudence dictates keeping a bigger part of their savings in cash.
The choices are different enough to be meaningful even for relatively modest sums -- and of much significance when parking, say, tens of thousands of dollars that you have pulled out of stocks.
Treasury bills -- Government i.o.u.'s sold at a discount and redeemed at face value at maturities that range up to a year -- are for the belt-and-suspenders crowd who insist on maximum safety and who will accept lower yields to avoid state and local income tax on interest. The return on the one-year bill was 4.66percent on Friday.
Interest rates are a bit higher on longer-term Treasury securities -- about 5 percent for two years and five years. But if you don't expect to hold these until maturity, be prepared for market prices to jump around; if you sell, you might get less than you paid.
Bond funds, including those that hold corporate issues, are another possibility. Shorter-term funds yield lower returns but are much less volatile. Whatever the horizon of the portfolio, experts caution against buying bond funds on the basis of advertised historical performance instead of current yields. You also need to be alert to sales, management and redemption fees, which can slash the return.
Bond funds with ultra-short-term holdings can offer higher returns than money market mutual funds with similar liquidity, but costs are typically higher, too. For many people, then, money market funds are likely the best place for stashing cash. These funds combine the convenience of a checking account with near-perfect liquidity and returns that can be more than double those paid on savings accounts. Unlike money market accounts at banks, however, money market mutual funds are not insured.
"It's the ultimate in flexibility," said Bruce R. Bent, president of the Reserve Funds, a mutual fund company based in Manhattan. Mr. Bent and a partner devised the money market fund in the early 1970's, creating what is now a $1.3 trillion industry.
Rates are averaging about 5.03 percent, and you don't have to lock up your money for a set period, as you would with a bank certificate of deposit. (A table listing money market fund yields is on page 26.)
There is often little to distinguish one money fund from another. But some have high minimum balances or other restrictions, like limits on the number of checks you can write. And note that, unless you're paying income taxes at very high rates -- the top Federal rate of 39.6 percent or a combination of state and Federal rates approaching that level -- you will almost certainly do better with a money fund that is invested in taxable short-term securities than in tax-exempt municipals.
"The vast majority of people would be better served by putting their money into taxable funds," said Mr. Bent, whose firm offers both kinds.
 
Take Money Where You Can Find It
When the economy and the stock market were both barreling ahead, some people got a bit carried away -- including those who thought it reasonable to carry credit card balances with 18 percent interest rates when they could make 30 percent a year by keeping that money in the stock market.
Now the odds have clearly shifted, said Gerri Detweiler, an adviser to Debt Counselors of America, a Rockville, Md.-based educational group whose sponsors include lenders. "The stock market is a risky place, while paying off your credit card is a guaranteed high-return, tax-free proposition," she said.
That is especially true if you select the card wisely. Ms. Detweiler recommends searching out one with a fixed, moderate rate and ignoring those splashy offers of cards with low teaser rates that jump after six months or a year to the high teens.
Even then, she said, make it a habit to pay your balance each month -- and pay on time. Growing numbers of card issuers are imposing fees as high as $29 for being just a couple of days late with a payment, no matter how little you owe.
There are other easy ways to trim debts and to lower interest payments if you've grown less sanguine about the performance of your investments. For instance, making extra payments on your mortgage can sharply reduce your interest payments over time, effectively putting money in your pocket.
"The roof over your head is substantially more secure than investing in the stock market," said Marc Eisenson, co-author of a new book, "Invest in Yourself: Six Secrets to a Rich Life" (John Wiley & Sons, 1998, $22.95).
Refinancing your mortgage is another possibility, though mortgage rates, hovering above 7 percent, have not fallen as sharply as might be expected, given the tumbling yields on Government bonds. An overarching principle here, of course, is that any cost-cutting is more valuable than it appears because, with state and Federal taxes, a dollar saved is worth as much as $1.50 earned.
Another principle is to take free money when it's offered to you. Even if you are worried about the market's trajectory, it's hard to make a case against accepting the company match on your contributions to a 401(k) plan or other savings programs.
"It is very important to continue to fund these plans," said Mr. Grodman, the New Hampshire financial planner. Despite the current unease, people should remember, he said, that "this is just one week or one month in the time horizon of their investment life."
 
Make Your Job a Better Investment
Have a lot of faith in your company's prospects, even though the stock has been beaten down? Maybe it's time to talk to the boss about the makeup of your pay package.
Not everyone has the necessary clout. But in light of lower share prices, some people whose compensation includes stock or options might succeed in arguing for an earlier or larger grant. Or they might ask to renegotiate their package: instead of $300,000 in cash, the arrangement could be $200,000 in cash plus some form of stock.
That, of course, is not the career move of someone who has a weak stomach. And benefits consultants expect that employers, anticipating queasiness to prevail among their staffs, may move in the opposite direction.
"Companies may start to look at performance-based cash plans," said Donald L. Lowman, managing director for compensation at Towers Perrin, the management consulting firm. In other words, old-fashioned bonuses could supplant stock-based incentive plans if the markets continue to slide.
This might also be a time to reassess a broader range of priorities in life, some of which may have been shoved aside in fin-de-siecle careerism and obsession with money. The tumble of the stock market could force a realization that there is more to life than work and its material rewards.
To Mr. Eisenson and his co-authors, the idea is to find your own balance of investments -- "a portfolio not just of stocks and bonds but one that includes investments in yourself and in your family."
But for most people, that will take quite an attitude adjustment; after all, their job is their chief economic asset. So even though the unemployment rate is at its lowest since the Nixon Administration, some people are bound to conclude that it wouldn't hurt to make an extra effort at the office. Or, perhaps, to think about some sideline work in case a weakening economy brings renewed bouts of corporate downsizing.
 
Mine the Rubble for Gold
Experienced investors know that markets nearly always overreact, but only a minority find the nerve to search out -- and actually buy -- the inevitable bargains. Sooner or later, though, solid stocks that have been tossed aside indiscriminately will be uncovered, often by those value-oriented investors who concentrate their hunt on a group that has been most thoroughly trashed.
"I look for an asset class that's way down," said Cynthia Meyers, a financial planner in Sacramento, Calif. -- as long as it is something that fits an investor's risk tolerance. These days, for example, she might ask clients if they can stomach gyrations in technology stocks.
For some investors, companies like Microsoft might qualify as good values, as would companies in other industries -- makers of farm equipment and other heavy machinery, for example. Other investors shop for companies whose stocks have more or less held up, like regional banks, figuring they may take off when the market steadies.
There is even value in losing money -- though it may be especially painful if the stock in question recently let you gloat over handsome paper profits. Losses, if actually realized, can minimize taxes by offsetting profits from the sale of other assets. You can even create such a loss without giving up on what you still think is a good idea or running afoul of rules barring wash transactions; you can switch, say, from Exxon to Mobil stock, or from one growth mutual fund to a similar one.
And if you're interested in passing along assets to children without subjecting the transfer to the gift tax, a drop in stock prices means that you can give them more shares before you and your spouse reach your annual limit of $20,000 per child.
In these iffy days, though, the single smartest thing to do may be to make a basic change in thinking -- and then to act accordingly.
"There's been a kind of greedy attitude, a naive assumption that we can invest in anything and it will go up," Ms. Meyers said. "It's good now that clients do see that downs come with the ups."

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL: Sport Utilities With Training Wheels;
'98 Isuzu Amigo: A Brawny Little Brute

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
MINI-SPORT utilities are for poseurs who covet the look, not the function. Face it: the real appeal of the wildly popular Subaru Forester, Toyota RAV4 and Honda CRV is comfort, splendid road manners and a great view of traffic.
One significant exception has been the Jeep Wrangler, the Jeep closest in spirit to the tough, simple general-purpose vehicles that landed with the Allies at Normandy. Now the Wrangler has to make room for some newcomers, including the Isuzu Amigo, a brawny little two-door beast with serious off-road capability and impressive V6 power to match. The downside is a harsh ride, wretched side vision and sticker shock. 
 The Isuzu Amigo made its debut in 1989 as a stripped-down utility for the young at heart. It was noisy and underpowered, and the canvas roof over what would otherwise have been the rear of a very small pick-up truck offered minimal protection against the elements. But it was cheap as four-wheel-drive vehicles go, cute and a great hit with people in their 20's.
The new 1998 Amigo (the old model rode into the sunset in 1994) still comes with a canvas top and soft plastic windows in the back. But a hard-roof option is planned as a 1999 model. Both versions offer more of what appealed to buyers of the old Amigo, plus an optional dose of muscle and luxury.
The base model has a 2.2 liter, 130 horsepower, four-cylinder engine, lean for a 3,335-pound truck. But the optional 3.2-liter, 205-horsepower aluminum V6, producing 214 pounds of torque at a modest 3,000 R.P.M., provides oomph.
All that power could be downright dangerous hitched to the primitive suspension of the earlier-generation Amigo. But the Isuzu engineers did their homework: while the vehicle feels heavy, it accelerates out of corners with impressive stability and only modest body roll. Anti-lock brakes and a somewhat mushy five-speed manual gearbox are standard.
I didn't try to navigate the Great Dismal Swamp in my test vehicle. It was fine, though, on poorly maintained dirt roads.
The Amigo is noisy at highway speeds, with the canvas top chattering in the wind. The stiff shocks guarantee that you feel every bump. And the backseat resembles a church pew, with the saving grace that it folds down easily to add cargo capacity.
But the front seats are comfy and supportive. The fit and finish are up to Japanese standards -- though the truck is manufactured in Indiana. And the stereo speakers are a cut above economy grade.
Apart from the busy, bumpy highway ride, the Amigo's only big fault is the big rear "C" pillars that stiffen the frame but create huge blind spots on both sides. Check that: there's also the price. While a two-wheel-drive version can be had for a shade more than $15,000, four-wheel drive and the V6 engine push it close to $20,000. A lot of money for your average surfer dude.

Sell the Range Rover; It's Ford Time

BYLINE: By William Grimes 

 BODY:
SO, the long slide begins. This time, though, instead of being boiled in oil, like they were in 1987, investors look as though they will get a slow poaching. If 1989 was a head-on at 60 miles per hour, 1998 is more like running out of gas on the Garden State just after you enter the express lanes.
Still, a hundred points here, a hundred points there -- pretty soon it begins to add up, and the formerly flush will have to start trading down. After nearly seven fat years on Wall Street, America may be poised for a life style retooling. 
 It will be subtle. Chastened by the last market crash, the Wall Street winners spent their cash with a lot less flash this time around. There are no swaggering figures on the scale of Michael R. Milken, Donald J. Trump or Ivan F. Boesky. There was less cocaine, more Deepak Chopra.
The arrogance of the 1980's gave way to humble gratitude in the 90's. America enjoyed the party for as long as it lasted, but always there was the nagging sense that midnight would arrive, the lights would dim and everyone would have to go home. It was fun while it lasted, but it had to end, and the end, in retrospect, could have been predicted.
Hemlines, historically an accurate leading economic indicator, plunged right down to the ankles this spring, anticipating the Dow's dive. And could it have been anything other than an omen when several Manhattan restaurateurs were rounded up last month for selling illicit Cuban cigars, the very emblem of the 90's-style Master of the Universe?
No one is going to be trading in a Cohibo for a Tiparillo, but adjustments will be made. The signature 90's car, the sport utility vehicle, will not go away, but the proud owner of a road-ruling Range Rover 4.0 may sneakily consider downsizing to a Ford Explorer. And if the market continues to contract, there's always a Kia Sportage. Have your eye on a Porsche 911? Try thinking Volkswagen Bug. Same basic shape.
At Manhattan's top steakhouses, the double magnums of Petrus will go back to the wine cellar. Instead, several sommeliers around town predict, the bonus babies who pushed the Bordeaux prices straight through the roof will return to comfort wines. "They'll go back to California, to wines like Beringer Private Reserve Cabernet, or anything by Phelps," said Andrea Immer, the wine director at Windows on the World. "When you're in a depressed state of mind, you don't get experimental."
Daniel Johnnes, the wine director at Montrachet, looks into his crystal ball and sees strange things. For the cult wines of the 90's, he said, look to Spain or Chile, where they turn out wines Wall Street wouldn't gargle with a year ago. "They might want to look for the boutique beers out of Belgium," he added helpfully.
Thanks a lot.
Although their wine sales might sag at the top end, restaurants could do well out of a market correction. "Good food is one of the last things you give up," Clark Wolf, a restaurant consultant, said. "You're more likely to give up your trip to that clever little island off the coast of whatever, so we may actually see more restaurant-going."
But count on the menu to change as foodies come eye-to-eye with a bear market. New Yorkers have been gobbling foie gras and truffles fast enough to create shortages. A more chaste cuisine may lie around the corner, not the comfort food of the early 90's but less indulgent fare. "We are going to find new peasant foods," Mr. Wolf predicted. "I see herbs. I see turkey burgers."
If it does nothing else, a punctured Dow could thin out the surplus population of cell phones, easing the pressure on area codes and eliminating the widespread pretraumatic stress syndrome associated with potential loss of one's 212 status. With luck, ugly additions like 908, 773 and 847 could be recalled.
Better yet, the market should let the air out of grossly distended Internet stocks. The 80's had junk bonds. The 90's have Yahoo and Amazon.com. and, if ever a scapegoat figure is going to emerge from the current mess, Bill Gates, supreme lord of the Net, could be it. The Justice Department's antitrust case against Microsoft comes up soon, and a comeuppance for its chief executive, Mr. Gates could ease a lot of social tension.
Mr. Gates replaced "greed is good," Gordon Gekko's famous 80's mantra, with a shambling, Jimmy Stewart style. There's a lot of free-floating anxiety in the air. Mr. Gates could be the man for the moment, a lightning rod for a lot of bad feelings.
Fashion looks as if it's right on the money, or lack of it. Although riding a wave of prosperity, designers hedged their bets for this fall, sneaking in more luxurious fabrics, fondling a little fur, but keeping the look dressed-down. It's a lot easier to climb down from cashmere than a Christian Lacroix pouf skirt, the image of late-80's excess. As though anticipating the recessionary mood, designers from Marc Jacobs to Calvin Klein have invested in a new color this season: gray. Gray is perfect. It suggests mild depression rather than black despair.
Meanwhile, someone ought to check in on Ira Rennert, the reclusive industrialist, out there in Bridgehampton. Is that house he is planning still going to be 72,000 square feet? Or is he maybe thinking of a nice four-bedroom Cape Cod?

HEADLINE: SPENDING IT;
Mixed Signals for Big-Ticket Buying

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON 

 BODY:
DON'T tell Chuck and Donna Gulland that last Monday's stock selloff was just one of those market dips of no lasting consequence. The couple were supposed to close last Tuesday on the sale of their home in Sunnyvale, Calif. "We had everything we owned packed," said Mrs. Gulland, who expected to turn over the keys of her three-bedroom, two-bath home to Antonitta and Joseph Blazina of San Jose.
"We walked in expecting to sign the last papers," Mrs. Gulland said, "and we were told the deal was off." The 1,700-square-foot home was to have sold for $489,900. 
 The Blazinas balked, unnerved by the stock market's effect on prospective buyers of their own five-bedroom home.
A few weeks earlier, those candidates were competing to meet the Blazinas' asking price of $589,900 -- behavior in keeping with the super-heated Silicon Valley real estate market, where home prices have been appreciating at double the national average.
But as the stock market continued to slide from the peaks set in July, and after scores of prospects had walked through the home the weekend before Monday's plunge, only a single offer -- $30,000 below the asking price -- was still on the table.
"We got scared," Ms. Blazina acknowledged. There could be weeks of uncertainty in home prices, she said, fueled by the stock market turmoil. So the Blazinas chose to forfeit their $15,000 deposit and scrapped the Gulland deal.
"Better to take the sure loss than maybe gamble," Ms. Blazina said, "and it could be more then."
The good times aren't over in Silicon Valley, or other enclaves where affluence rose with the raging bull market. Expensive homes are still being bought -- and cars and boats and baubles, too.
But stories like those of the Gullands and Blazinas are popping up in even the most comfortable circles, as big-ticket purchases are reconsidered in light of the markets' tumble of the last two months.
For example, some clients of Farid Saatchi, owner of F & S Jewelry in Manhattan, were less enthusiastic than usual last week.
He said one customer, who earns her living investing, changed her mind about buying $15,000 of unset diamonds. "She wanted to wait and see what happens," Mr. Saatchi said. "People slow down on everything. They get nervous."
And the market's whipsaw slowed the buying impulses of two serious prospects for Business Jetsolutions, a Dallas company that sells ownership shares in private jets. Michael C. Riegel, a vice president, said both clients were executives in stock funds.
"They asked to delay," said Mr. Riegel, who valued the now-dormant deals at less than $500,000 apiece. "I think they'll be back with us in a number of weeks."
Mr. Reigel's optimistic outlook is widely shared in the ranks of the affluent -- or even the reasonably comfortable.
In fact, instead of putting the brakes on spending, some Michigan consumers saw the stock market's weakness as a sign to buy -- cars, that is.
In recent years, some longtime customers of the Pontiac-Olds-GMC dealer in Frankenmuth, Mich., had neglected their annual rite of selecting a new model. "Most bought a new car every year," said Michael D. Young, the owner of the dealership, adding that many customers are former auto workers, eligible for a manufacturer's discount.
He said one of the customers explained his absence as a consequence of the surging market. "Why draw 20 grand out of the market when it's earning 20 percent?"
Within the last 10 days, though, four such customers came in with cash in hand, ready to buy. "They put it off because they wanted to put their money in the market," Mr. Young said. "When it dropped, it put them over the edge."
Garth Blumenthal, general manager of Fletcher Jones Motorcars, a Mercedes-Benz dealership in Newport Beach, Calif., said it sold 90 new cars the last five days of August. "It's a pretty typical or better-than-average month-end," he said.
"Our business isn't affected by Asia and Russia," he said, referring to the regions whose financial crises may well have prompted the market's decline. "Interest rates play a very strong role," he said.
THEN there were those who left the market before the plunge. Gary R. Clifford, a luxury yacht broker for Richard Bertram & Company in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., said his customers weren't troubled by recent market turmoil because "a lot of people are already liquid."
Some buyers favoring Bertram's Italian boats were already in cash, anticipating that the dollar would weaken against the euro, Europe's new currency, when it is adopted next January, he said.
Mr. Clifford said he personally sold three yachts, for more than $1.7 million each, in the last month, and overall sales at Bertram have been normal. "No one's canceled."
Bertram's confidence is reflected in its inventory, which includes an $8.8 million, 118-foot Benetti yacht that is to be displayed at a boat show in January. "For us to put these very expensive products in stock means we are very aggressive," Mr. Clifford said.
Far from Fort Lauderdale, Wayne W. Crosby, a real estate broker in Midland, Mich., ignored any losses in his stock portfolio and was set to complete a purchase sometime this week of a 40-foot pleasure boat costing $300,000. "With low interest rates, you can't own it any cheaper," he said.
William B. Brennan, co-owner of Brennan Marine Sales in Bay City, Mich., who is selling the boat to Mr. Crosby, said: "I don't ever recall it making a difference in our sales. People don't sell stock to buy a boat."
They sometimes do, though, to buy jewelry, according to Alfredo J. Molina, a jeweler in Phoenix. "My product is looked on as diversification of assets," Mr. Molina said. "We've had a record year. A lot of people have been taking profits."
Last Monday and Tuesday, for example, Mr. Molina said, customers bought a $60,000 five-carat emerald ring, a $450,000 ruby-and-sapphire bracelet and a $145,000 diamond necklace.
While buying jewelry can be seen as a flight to hard assets during uncertain times, Mr. Molina said he thinks his customers justify their purchases for a different reason. "They believe in enjoying their money," he said. "None that I've talked to are running for cover."
Nor is he. Mr. Molina is expanding his shop by 4,200 square feet and adding Spanish jewelry by Carerra y Carerra, Chopard Swiss watches and Cartier accessories. "Finding merchandise is the biggest challenge," he said.
An equally bullish appraisal for luxury sales came from Anthony J. D'Ambrosio, executive vice president of Tourneau Inc., the Swiss watch retailer whose line includes $3,000 Rolexes and $75,000 Patek Philippe timepieces.
"The reality is, the best products we can't get enough of," he said from his Manhattan office, adding that Tourneau customers enjoy showing off their financial success.
"You can't take your Van Gogh into the boardroom, or a restaurant or to the beach," Mr. D'Ambrosio said. "People who do well in the market are people who are experienced; it doesn't affect their spending."

HEADLINE: Foreign Expansion: Well-Planned Or Ill-Timed?

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: SANTIAGO, Chile

 BODY:
ARTHUR M. BLANK, the president of Home Depot, was brimming with optimism as he left Atlanta the other day on his way to visit his first store outside North America, a store that sits at the foot of the snow-capped Andes, flies the Chilean flag and houses a McDonald's franchise.
This cultural hybrid is the beachhead for a planned expansion that Mr. Blank hopes will take Home Depot's name-tagged orange aprons, do-it-yourself home-improvement workshops and steady sales growth first across Chile, then to Argentina and eventually to Peru, Brazil and beyond. 
 "We could be successful almost anywhere," Mr. Blank said. "Over the long haul, we are going to be a truly global company."
But as he stepped off the plane in Chile on Aug. 28, just a day after the Santiago store opened, Mr. Blank was greeted by this headline in the country's leading newspaper, El Mercurio: "Worldwide Landslide: Black Thursday in Latin America's Markets."
Only three years ago, Home Depot, which has 679 stores in the United States and Canada, scrapped plans to expand into Mexico because of a currency crisis that sent similar shivers across Latin America. Once the region got back on track, the company was ready to test the Latin waters again. But this time it turned to Chile, whose expanding middle class and predictable free-market Government policies over nearly two decades have made it a model of stability for emerging markets around the world.
Now the economic pendulum may be swinging back again -- just at the wrong time for Home Depot, and underscoring the vulnerability of even the most stolid Latin American economies to global turmoil. Santiago's stock market, down more than 44 percent since Jan. 1 and at its lowest level in five years, plummeted 6.2 percent on the day before Mr. Blank arrived.
Chilean consumers, taking their cues from the stock slump and the worsening news from Asia and Russia, are tightening their belts. Car sales and, more important to Home Depot, construction starts are grinding down quickly. Local economists predict that the unemployment rate, now at 6 percent, will climb to 8 percent in coming months. Politicians who just a few weeks ago predicted confidently that Chile could withstand the icy winds blowing from Asia have begun to advise consumers to take it easy with their credit cards.
The Asian and Russian contagions have been racing through Latin America at an accelerating rate, pushing commodity prices lower and chasing away foreign investment dollars, trends that in turn are forcing up interest rates. In Venezuela, for instance, short-term bank interest rates have shot up to 120 percent.
Colombia devalued its currency on Wednesday, sending Latin markets down sharply even as the region's finance ministers traveled to Washington to tell the International Monetary Fund that their economies were sound. Reassurances aside, J. P. Morgan has cut its prediction of 1999 growth for Argentina from 4 percent to 2 percent; for Brazil, whose large economy is South America's main economic motor, the forecast has been cut from 2 percent to minus 2 percent. Net outflows of foreign exchange from Brazil were nearly $8 billion in August alone.
So is Mr. Blank worried?
"It does not affect our plans at all," he said. In fact, he sees an opportunity to pick up real estate for more stores at lower prices.
"Over the next 40 years, 50 years, we'll be here," Mr. Blank said, thumping his palms on a table in his Chilean headquarters. And when he sees customers and employees "with smiles on their faces, I don't even have to work out the numbers," he added. "The numbers are going to come."
Mr. Blank's gung-ho Yankee optimism has been reinforced by Home Depot's 20 years of sensational growth -- the company's stock has risen fortyfold over the past decade.
The growth has held up in good times and bad; after all, even when Americans stay home at vacation time to save on air fares and hotels, they often build bookshelves or paint the den. And a leaking roof or faucet must be repaired or replaced no matter how much the Dow Jones industrial average falls that week.
Home Depot is betting that the same verities will apply to Chile, a country whose demographics -- one third of the country's 15 million people are between the ages of 20 and 39 -- fit neatly into the company's marketing strategies. Company executives were publicly exuberant about sales and customer reaction in the first few days after the Santiago store opened, although they refused to release any numbers.
In the end, Home Depot's experiment in Chile -- though complicated at the outset by the specter of a worldwide recession -- will serve as a fascinating case study of whether a highly successful American corporation can take its winning culture abroad and make it work despite language barriers, long supply lines and differing customer tastes. Simply put, are the American middle-class values woven into Home Depot's image transferable to Chile, a Spanish-speaking nation half a world away from the company's Georgia headquarters?
MANY local business executives say Home Depot is pushing an open door. "Chileans always say if it's American, it's good," said Alexander Fernandez, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Chile. "You can call it a mystique, a respect."
But the answer will ultimately lie with families like the Chilcumpas, who were so eager to shop in Home Depot on opening day that they fought through Santiago's heavy traffic for 45 minutes in their beat-up 1986 Dodge Colt.
Jimmy Chilcumpa, 35, finished graduate school two years ago and now teaches geology at the University of Chile. His wife, Marcela, 30, is a bookkeeper at a local finance company. Both dress in blue jeans and wear designer sunglasses. Their 8-year-old daughter, Mariel, says her sweetest dream is to fly to Orlando someday to see Disney World, as an estimated 70,000 Chileans do every year.
Concerned about the slowing economy just after having a new baby, the Chilcumpas say they are watching their pesos. Still, they have a new house on the outskirts of Santiago that they need to fix up and furnish.
Walking up and down the wide aisles of the new store, Mr. Chilcumpa expressed disappointment. "I thought I'd find American products at a cheap price," he said. "What I see is not cheap." Indeed, 70 percent of the store's stock is made in Chile, and prices are comparable to those of local competitors.
Mr. Chilcumpa was shopping for a wall mount for a television set; what he found instead in the furnishings aisle was a mount intended to be suspended from the ceiling. He shook his head. Just then, a Chilean employee named Carlos came by to help, wearing a wide, inviting smile.
"Is that all you have?" Mr. Chilcumpa asked sharply.
"For now, yes," Carlos replied. "We're just starting, so we are strong in some things, weak in others."
In other stores in Chile, or in the United States, for that matter, the exchange might have ended then and there. But this is Home Depot, where employees are trained to listen to customers. Carlos pulled out a pad and pen and began interviewing Mr. Chilcumpa, asking exactly what he was looking for. He promised to forward the information to management.
The exchange instantly warmed Mr. Chilcumpa's mood. He slowed his pace and wandered about the store, taking a special interest in the displays that gave point-by-point instructions on topics like how to fix a toilet, solder pipes or lay tiles. He stopped at a display of 31-piece titanium drill sets, made in Taiwan, costing the equivalent of $23 each, and put one in his cart. A sale was made.
"They definitely have a wide variety," his wife said. "That's what will make them successful."
The Chilcumpas then drove to a nearby outlet of Sodimac Homecenter, a chain that is Home Depot's direct competitor here, to find the television mount they were looking for.
As Home Depot moves from a 110-volt world where most houses are built of wood and nails to a 220-volt world where most houses are built of cement and metal reinforcement rods, it will have to adjust its inventories.
"In retail, no concept is 100 percent portable," said Enrique Ostale, executive director of Distribucion y Servicio, a leading Chilean supermarket and houseware chain holding company. "They will have to adapt."
For the most part, the record of American companies is good in Chile and the rest of Latin America, but their success in transporting American-style services and products is not guaranteed. McDonald's is a hit everywhere, as are the mini-markets connected to Exxon stations. But Sears, Roebuck flopped in Chile in the early 1980's and pulled out.
J.C. Penney made some early mistakes when it put a store in the affluent Santiago neighborhood of Las Condes in 1996. The company misread Chilean taste, which favors simple clothes, and offered expensive lines in the flashy colors popular in more tropical markets like Miami and Mexico. After a disappointing performance, the store replaced American managers with local talent, put greater emphasis on less expensive items and went after Chile's growing maternity market, offering a huge department for expectant mothers. Sales picked up, and Penney recently opened a second store.
Home Depot has taken pains to avoid similar slips. It mixes what is American and what is Chilean as carefully as its employees mix paints to get exactly the right color.
"It's a balancing act," said Bill Pena, 44, Home Depot's regional president for Argentina and Chile.
First, the company looked for the right management combination. It teamed up with Falabella, an upscale Chilean department store chain, which has a 33 percent interest in the project. Falabella advised Home Depot on where to put stores, plugged the company into its public relations and market research firms, and, most important, provided a base of two million customers who can use their Falabella credit cards at Home Depot.
The first Home Depot store is in La Florida, a sprawling lower-middle-class Santiago neighborhood with the fastest construction growth rate of any urban community in Chile. The second and third Santiago stores, to open over several months, will be in Maipu, a neighborhood similar to La Florida, and in Las Condes. The goal for 2000 is to have five stores in Chile.
Home Depot executives said they were opening the La Florida and Maipu stores first to send a message that the chain was price-conscious and would appeal to the lower middle class, the large majority of Chilean society.
In accord with its tradition of decentralized management, Home Depot put a Chilean in charge of its operations in the country -- Julio Campos, who, as a senior Sodimac executive, led the team that adapted the home-center concept for Chile.
Mr. Campos spent six months in the United States, learning Home Depot culture. He sometimes worked in the aisles or even as a bagger at the checkout counter.
"I worked 11 years in this industry in Chile, and the first time I soldered anything was in a store in the United States," Mr. Campos said. "Most companies in Chile are very hierarchical, with executives in ties. At Home Depot we all wear smocks, and when an associate has a suggestion he speaks up," he added, using the company's term for an employee.
With Mr. Campos as his guide, Mr. Pena spent more than six months studying the Chilean market. They used focus groups and research, but most of all they wore out shoe leather, walking through Chilean shopping centers and hardware stores and interviewing hundreds of contractors.
As a result, Home Depot's shelves have a different look here than they do in the United States. There are fewer rugs and more ceramic tiles. Instead of automatic garage-door openers, there are remote-control gate openers. Concrete and metal are the construction materials of choice, so there is a large stock of jackhammers, welders and grinders for cutting metal. Many of Home Depot's American suppliers have opened operations in Chile as well, shortening supply lines as they also learn to satisfy Chilean tastes.
Central to Home Depot's philosophy in the United States is sound employee relations, and it is no different here. "Some people think of us as a cult or a religion, and they are right," Mr. Pena said with a laugh.
ELEVEN thousand Chileans applied for just over 200 positions at the La Florida store, and Home Depot used extensive interviews, exams on practical math, and psychological tests to choose people with experience and friendly, open attitudes. The pay scale is lower than in the United States -- company officials wouldn't say by how much -- but Chilean employees, like American workers, can buy Home Depot stock at a 15 percent discount, and supervisors, beginning with assistant managers, receive stock options.
To learn the ropes, 30 Chilean employees were sent to the United States for three to six months to shadow their American counterparts. Once they returned to Santiago, they helped train their Chilean colleagues. And a group of bilingual American managers came here to train workers and instill the company's esprit de corps.
Two nights before opening day, the store gave a party for local employees and their families, complete with games and a barbecue; 1,600 people showed up. There was also a pep rally.
As in the United States, employees here are told that they can question management, but the sometimes aggressive, almost confrontational approach taken in American stores to hash out ideas has been softened to fit the more reserved personal interactions typical in Chile.
It is too early to know whether such corporate strategies will let Home Depot eventually dominate the Chilean hardware market. But Sodimac, which modeled itself in part after Home Depot more than a decade ago, is taking no chances. The chain has opened more stores, lowered prices, expanded parking lots, improved service and updated its computerized systems.
"I am not afraid, but I do respect them," said Carlos Wulf Urrutia, Sodimac's vice president for home center operations. "Construction activity is decelerating, and we are much more prepared because of our long-term relationships with contractors. Home Depot should have come two years ago. They waited too long."
Wall Street analysts are cautiously optimistic that Home Depot can succeed in Chile despite the economic slowdown, saying the company has far more to gain than to lose. As Home Depot saturates the American and Canadian markets over the next 10 years, they said, it needs to look abroad for expansion.
"The next 8 to 12 months are iffy," said Francisco Chevez of Salomon Smith Barney, "but over the long haul the underpinnings for this type of retailing are great in Chile and around Latin America."
Aram H. Rubinson, a retail analyst at Paine Webber, said that for a chain the size of Home Depot, a less-than-expected return from five stores in Chile "is not even a rounding error."
"From what they learn in Chile," he added, "they are going to be able to attack and succeed in some of the bigger countries of the world."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS IN TURMOIL: SHORT-SELLING;
The Joys And Perils Of Betting On a Fall

BYLINE: By NOELLE KNOX 

 BODY:
MANY of the mutual funds that find themselves in good stead these days have something in common: big short positions.
Caldwell & Orkin Market Opportunity bet 40 percent of its portfolio on falling stock prices, and was up 3.6 percent from the market peak on July 17 through Thursday, according to Morningstar Inc., the financial publisher in Chicago. Lindner Bulwark, shorting 25 percent of its assets, saw its shares climb 5.8 percent for the same period. 
 Investors short a stock as a way to profit from its decline. They borrow the shares from a broker for a small fee and sell them. After the share price declines, they buy back the shares at the lower market price and return them to the broker, pocketing the difference.
It's a risky game. If the shares rise, the investor has to buy them back for more than he paid and take a loss. That is what happened to William J. Nasgovitz, whose Heartland Small Cap Contrarian fund, despite the vicious selloff in small and micro-size stocks, has been crippled by unprofitable short positions coupled with the overall market decline. The fund lost 18.7 percent from the July 17 peak through Thursday, worse than the 17 percent loss for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index over that period.
Situations like this underscore why many funds swear off shorting stocks -- and how the strategies of shorting seem as varied as the managers who make such bets.
 
A Different Potential
"We look for companies that we believe have misled investors about their potential in the future," said Andrew F. Boord, co-manager of Lindner Bulwark, which has $28.8 million in assets under management. "We try to go short on those kind of stocks, regardless of what the market does."
Mr. Boord loves to hate Daou Systems Inc., a San Diego-based information technology consultant to health care companies. From a high of $34.375 last Sept. 23, Daou's stock closed at $6.625 on Friday.
Mr. Boord, 26, started shorting shares at the beginning of the year. By the end of June, at an average price of $18, Daou had become his largest short position.
Daou's earnings have met Wall Street's expectations, but Mr. Boord said, "When you look at how they made their numbers it's almost laughable; it's pretty strange." In particular, he points to a fast-growing line on Daou's balance sheet called "work in progress," under which Daou includes a percentage of revenues from unbilled contracts. "It shouldn't grow that much more than revenues," he said.
Scott Rieger, a spokesman for Daou, said the practice is required under generally accepted accounting principles and was validated by its accountants, Ernst & Young.
But such bookkeeping has apparently raised concern among other investors. On Aug. 14, the company's stock plunged 31 percent on rumors that Daou would have to restate its second-quarter earnings. The company issued a news release defending its financial statements. Nevertheless, the company was hit with two-class action lawsuits contending accounting irregularities.
(Daou has issued a statement saying it had "meritorious defenses" against the claims and planned to defend itself vigorously.).
Over all, however, Lindner Bulwark's numbers display the ugly battle scars of shorting in a bull market. Since its February 1994 inception, it has lost 1.4 percent annually, on average, versus a 20.2 annual return for S.& P. 500. And in 1998, it has lost 1.9 percent, through Thursday.
 
A Tough World
"We proved it's very difficult selling short Wall Street's most-loved, over-owned, and over-valued growth stocks," said Mr. Nasgovitz, 53, president of Heartland Advisors, which manages $4 billion.
His Heartland Small Cap Contrarian mutual fund, with $113.4 million in assets, can hold up to 25 percent of its assets in short positions, and was off 26.2 percent for this year as of Thursday. On Aug. 18, Mr. Nasgovitz announced plans to merge the fund with the $1.6 billion Heartland Value fund, which does not short stocks.
He has spent the last few weeks buying stocks to cover some 20 short positions. On Sept. 1, he closed out a successful 300,000-share short positions on Organogenesis, which he shorted at $18 a share and bought back at $9. And he also won big betting against Micron Technology. He bought 85,000 shares at about $23 a share, covering a short at $33. Finally, he bought 100,000 shares of Compaq Computer at about $30 a share, taking a small loss. He shorted all three companies because he thought they were overvalued.
Mr. Nasgovitz has three shorts remaining on Heartland's books: Clear Channel Communications, Consolidated Graphics and Dollar Tree Stores. He sees them as trading at inflated prices, yet their shares have continued to rise.
Since its April 1995 inception, the fund has returned 5.7 percent annually on average, through Thursday, versus 11.8 percent for its average small-cap value peer, according to Morningstar.
 
The Big Picture
Michael B. Orkin, 39, manager of Caldwell & Orkin Market Opportunity, is a big-picture thinker. He looks at the economic crisis in Asia and shorts large companies in the United States involved in cyclical industries like steel, engineering and construction that will be hurt by it.
Since June, he also has been increasing his short positions in companies that lend money to people with less-than-stellar credit histories. These sub-prime lenders, as they are known, can have problems when the economy sours and people cannot afford to pay their debts.
"I don't know if we're in a bear market now, or just a correction," he said. "But I do expect a significant bear market between now and the next 10 years, with a 60 percent-plus downside."
Mr. Orkin declined to name specific stocks that he is shorting. But according to the fund's annual report, as of April 30 its largest short positions were in Caterpillar and PMI Group, a mortgage insurer. They have since fallen 19.3 and 32.1 percent, respectively.
The fund was closed to new investors on Aug. 27, after it was flooded with $150 million, almost doubling its assets in 10 weeks. Small wonder: The fund has sizzled, returning 20.2 percent for the year through Thursday, according to Morningstar.

Both have tried to bolster returns for investors with short-selling strategies. Michael B.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS IN TURMOIL: THE LEGEND;
Study the Trees Closely, But Just Skim the Forest

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
PETER LYNCH has a thought about the global market meltdowns that have been a consuming nightmare for many investors over the last year. "The world," he said last week, "will be O.K." Next topic, please.
Such a blithe dismissal of the woes of the world is a vintage response from Mr. Lynch, the former manager of the Fidelity Magellan fund who is widely viewed as one of the greatest stock-pickers on the planet. And he has long maintained that if investors spend five minutes a year trying to figure out the direction of the stock market, that's about four and a half too many. 
 "Look at the headlines from 1990," he said in an interview, proceeding to quote from a list of articles about the real estate bust and America's competitive and banking woes. "The year after that," Mr. Lynch noted, "the market went up 31 percent."
"So how does that add anything, responding to headlines?" he asked. "These headlines are just noise. If you're going to be a factual investor, and you say, 'In my industry, I make widgets, and in every recession since World War II, my demand has gone down quickly, and I notice it quickly,' well, that's information. And if you think a major recession's coming, then maybe you ought to sell some of your stock funds."
Investing based on fact rather than feeling is not a new theme for Mr. Lynch, but it's one that he is emphasizing again in a new Fidelity advertising campaign in which he stars with the entertainer Lily Tomlin. The message, a favorite of Mr. Lynch's, is that individuals should spend at least as much time researching their investments -- without wasting time trying to gauge the overall direction of the economy -- as they do for a new-car purchase or a vacation. And that they should ignore the predictions of economists and market strategists.
"From 1953 to 1984, a period of 31 years, the stock market went up 920 points," Mr. Lynch said. "On Mondays, it was down 1,565. So on non-Mondays, it was up 2,500 points. It wasn't a coincidence that the big decline in 1987, last October and this week was on a Monday. People on the weekend become economists. They become portfolio strategists. But they don't look at their portfolios; they're reading the newspapers. They're responding to all these scary stories. After that, they're bold if they take their lunch to work on Monday."
Mr. Lynch reserves some special scorn for the dismal science. "I'm opposed to economic forecasts," he said, "these people who say, 'The average economic recovery has been 6.8 years; therefore, we have to have a recession.' I've read the Constitution. I've read the Bill of Rights. I didn't see anywhere that every 6.8 years we have to have a recession."
Corporate profits are what drive stock prices, Mr. Lynch said. And as long as a company's earnings are rising, its stock will go up. Sometimes, however, the market gets ahead of overall earnings growth.
"Last year the corporate profits of the S.& P. 500 were up less than 10 percent. The market was up 33 percent," he said. "In the first half of this year, the market was up 18 percent, but corporate profits were down in the first half. I think most people expect corporate profits to be up 5 to 7 percent this year. There's an unbelievable correlation between corporate profits and stock prices, but the lines started to separate."
What also matters, Mr. Lynch said, is the valuation of a company compared with its earnings, and in that regard, there still are some great imbalances in the stock market. "Over the last three years and eight months, the S.& P. is up 132 percent, while the Russell 2000 is up 32 percent," he said. "These are mind-boggling divergences. Their earnings have both grown the same. It's not like you've had huge disappointments in the Russell 2000. If their earnings had fallen 40 percent, you could understand this bifurcation. But the Russell 2000 is a lot of different companies."
To Mr. Lynch, all that creates opportunities in small stocks. "At one point, Wal-Mart was not in the S.& P. 500," he noted. "At one point, Cisco wasn't there. Great stocks are usually small companies or companies that really get slogged and they turn around. Masco went up 500-fold, then it got in the S.& P. 500, and it hasn't been that great a stock since then. Great stocks usually are really small companies, or companies that are really depressed, as when Lockheed was $4 a share, or Long Island Lighting fell to $3.
"Traditionally, big companies don't have big moves," he added. "Small- and medium-sized companies have the big moves. Look at the great rollovers of all time. Polaroid was one of the biggest stocks in the market at one time. Xerox was one of the biggest, then it went down for the next 15 years. I.B.M. went sideways for 15 years. Avon Products went from 180 to 18. It's hard when every fourth person in America was an Avon lady. Where were they going to go with it? Size is not a positive. At some point, if you become 90 percent of the carpet industry, you're going to grow with the carpet industry."
Mr. Lynch confesses that he is primarily a stock investor, with 90 percent of his investment assets in equities. "But I had 20 percent of my fund in bonds in '81 and '82," he said. "Since 1926, there have been 20 down calendar years in the stock market. In 18 of those 20 years, you'd have had a positive total return in intermediate bonds. Not just better, you'd have been up. So there really is a reason to own bonds."

HEADLINE: The World: Inside the Mind of North Korea's 'Dear Leader';
First, Pay Attention. And Then Pay Up.

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
SO I finally got the world's attention! The United States and Japan thought they could ignore me and -- kersplash -- I send one missile shooting over Japan, and finally they look in my direction. Ha! Maybe I should do this more often!
And then they call me irrational. Can't they see that this was the only rational thing to do? If I didn't scare them every now and then, they would ignore me totally and I'd be like Fidel Castro, a nothing. 
 Look at me! The imperialists tried to bully me back in 1994, telling me I had to stop my nuclear program. But I was ready to go to war with them, and so they decided to save lives and chicken out. We reached a big agreement: I would freeze my program and the Americans and the other countries would give me free heating oil and build me a $4 billion light-water nuclear reactor. You've got to be pushy.
 
Yankee Double-Cross
Of course, the Americans tried to double-cross me. Despite their agreement, they wouldn't lift most of their sanctions, they lagged in building the new reactor, they delayed shipping me oil and they didn't even think about normalizing relations.
I was ready to get rid of my whole missile program in exchange for the right payoff, but they wouldn't cough up the kind of dough I was talking about. They wouldn't pay me money and they wouldn't pay attention.
Well, now maybe they'll pay something! If my nuclear program got them to give me a $4 billion reactor and free oil, think what my missile program should be worth -- especially since the Central Intelligence Agency thinks I still have a few nukes that I just might figure out how to attach to a missile. The imperialists were worried about my old Nodong missiles, which couldn't even reach Tokyo. Well, they missed a bargain. Now they'll have to pay billions for my program, because I can take out anything in Japan. And if my engineers can improve the booster rocket, I'll be able to reach Alaska and Hawaii.
O.K., O.K., I know the missiles are hopelessly inaccurate. But so what if I aim for the Yankee base at Yokosuka and hit Tokyo instead? It just makes the Japanese more nervous than ever. And their fear is what gives me bargaining power.
 
Getting Paid
Yeah, and think of all that free advertising I got. The Syrians and Iranians see Secretary of State yapping puppy Albright denounce my missiles, and they'll pay more than ever. I'll get paid off one way or another; by the Yankees for giving up my missile program or by the Syrians and Iranians for continuing it. These two-stage rockets can deliver a one-ton payload more than 1,000 miles, and Israel will be in the bombsights.
Of course, my Foreign Ministry is whining these days. The diplomats say we may have overplayed our hand, and they're worried now that Japan has cut off aid and flights to our country, now that the Yankee Congress is sniveling about whether to back away from the 1994 nuclear agreement. Huh! Wimps!
Washington will come through because it knows that it would be risking war if it didn't. Sure, I would lose. But I've got one thing in my favor: 10 million people within artillery range. Seoul will be a sea of flames. I have the guts to fight to lose, but the Yankees don't have the stomach to fight to win.
The imperialists don't really think I'd level Seoul, but they can't be sure. Sometimes it pays to be perceived as irrational, and sending a missile racing over Japan just adds to my credibility as a maniac. (And wasn't it a nice touch when we said later that the missile launched a scientific satellite transmitting immortal revolutionary hymns?)
Oh, yeah, sure, if the Yankees do cut off aid, then that will make it tougher here. But when things get really desperate, people will come running with aid. If people go hungry here, then the pressure is on Washington and Tokyo, not me.
I love to read what these foreign analysts say. They think North Korea is falling apart. It's just like those foreigners who thought China was falling apart in the early 1950's. But hunger doesn't make people rebel; it just makes them die.
In China, 30 million people died in Mao Zedong's famine of the early 1960's; there wasn't a peep of protest. Then Deng Xiaoping gave the Chinese people pork and rice and they tried to stage a revolution against him at Tiananmen Square.
I'll never make that mistake. I know that contact with barbarians or, worse, bourgeois democracy, destabilizes a country. I'll never open up my country the way Deng did.
Those arrogant foreigners think they can make life hard on us and change us. This is Korea! We're not weaklings. If we were compromisers our nation would have been absorbed by China or Japan a thousand years ago.
 
Tough to Be King
Two hundred years ago, King Yongjo knew his son would be a terrible heir, so he locked the weeping young man in a box in the courtyard and left him to die. It took 13 days. That's the toughness that it takes to be a king of Korea, and I've got that toughness.
The South Korean puppets have lost their strength, and we in the North are the only real Koreans left. That's why we have restored a dynasty, just like the ancients. My father died four years ago, and the foreigners all puzzled about why I didn't fill the vacancy and whether that meant I was weak. Don't they know about filial piety? If they had read Korean history, they would have known that a good Korean prince waits several years before succeeding his father. I'm not a Communist. I'm a Confucian.
Now it is my turn to succeed my father as President and party leader. I'll reform the economy and try to rely more on the market mechanism, because that's the only thing that works. But I'll never open up this country. I'll never risk losing control.
I will stand up to the foreigners and my people will stand behind me, as long as they have the strength to stand. I need enemies more than I need friends.
Ah, yes, what a lovely missile that was. It made me a few more enemies. They can despise me, insult me. But they'll have to respect me.
Poor little Castro. I should sell him a missile or two to launch over Florida. Then he would get some respect as well, and maybe some American foreign aid.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
The Finns Find Glitter In Russia's Shadow

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM 

DATELINE: HELSINKI

 BODY:
FOUR years ago, Finland established a free-trade zone along its border to encourage business with Russia, hoping to revive a relationship that had all but collapsed along with the dissolution of the Soviet order.
Acer, the computer company based in Taiwan, decided to test the waters with a modest assembly operation at Lappeenranta, a small outpost on the Finnish side of the border, about 620 miles from Moscow. 
 Now the Acer assembly plant can hardly cope with demand from Russia. And the town of a few hundred people has grown into a city of 50,000, dotted with large and small operations for wood products, construction material, food, alcohol and trucking -- all targeted for Russia.
"We have the best of both worlds -- the safety of operating this side of the border and such close proximity to a huge market," said Natalya Kostina, 28, a Russian who is deputy operations manager of the Acer plant. "Our customers pay less by taking the products assembled here and moving it themselves. They know how to navigate the chaos of Russia, and we avoid the headache of insuring security. It's perfect."
For as long as anyone in Finland can remember, the 800-mile border with Russia was viewed as a liability, an origin of invasions and an entryway for refugees and crime. This nation of five million people has had 10 wars with its huge neighbor over the past 600 years.
Yet the collapse of the Soviet Union has resulted in a bonanza for the Finns. In a world tossed into economic turmoil by Russia's dysfunction, Finland is cashing in.
"It is a gold mine for Finland," Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen said in a recent conversation here. And he expects the trade between the nations to grow, despite the risks.
One analyst here estimates that 20,000 Finnish businesses are engaged in the Russian trade. There has also been a huge increase in investment by American companies like I.B.M., Hewlett-Packard, Carrier and Sikorsky, and several American trucking companies have bought into Finnish firms.
"The foundation was strong," explained Jukka Leinonen, director of Hewlett-Packard's Baltic States operations here. "The Finns have known the Russians for a long time. You can drive a train from Finland all the way to Moscow or the Baltics, and it is difficult even for the Russian Mafia to harass a train."
Mr. Leinonen said that 20 percent of his $321 million in sales in Eastern Europe goes to Russia and the Baltic states. "It is the fastest growth area for us," he said. "There is not one year since 1992 when our sales did not grow by at least 100 percent."
Expanding trade with Russia via Finland enjoys significant if low-key support in the United States. Strategists headed by Strobe Talbott, the Deputy Secretary of State, have given their blessing, diplomats say, to the "Northern Dimension," as the projects tying Northern Russia to the European Union are known.
"It is difficult to find Russian competitive exports that are more attractive than energy," said Jaakko Ihamuotila, who heads Neste, the big Finnish energy company that is merging with IVO Group to form the Fortum Corporation. "Naturally, we are now looking into developing" Russian oil and gas holdings. Since 1980, he said, the company's Russian work force has grown from five or six people to 200, mostly operating gas stations. A steadily growing share of Neste's $800 million in annual sales comes from Russia, and the company gets 40 percent of its crude oil from Russian fields.
Russia today may be in chaos, but that hasn't slowed Finland's penetration of its markets.
Consider Valio, a dairy products company that was close to going under in 1990, when it discovered the rapacious Russian market next door. Today, Valio controls some 20 percent of the market in its field in St. Petersburg, whose population, at five million, rivals that of all of Finland. "Their per capita income may be much smaller than ours, but their appetite and purchasing power for some foods -- cheese, for example -- is huge," said Esa Luomanpera, a Valio vice president. Sales to Russia amounted to 10 percent of the company's $1.8 billion in revenues last year.
"Some things you just need," Mr. Luomanpera said of his company's line of dairy products.
Given the picture of a Russia tumbling out of control, its currency effectively devalued, who in Russia is doing all the buying?
"You name it," said Olavi Urvas, manager of Russian trade for Outokumpu, a large mineral holding company that has six units doing business with Russia. "Retail trade, wholesale, banks, financial institutions, private schools, health care, construction. They all need expertise and are willing to pay for it."
Small-time Finnish operators are doing just as well as larger ones.
"It only takes six hours to drive to Russia from Helsinki," said Stephen Lowe, an independent exporter who operates in the border region selling bananas and other food items. "We are doing a cash business. I stock my goods five minutes from the Russian border and deliver as soon as they pay in rubles, which I convert as soon as I collect, so there are no losses in exchange rates.
"Finland," he said, "is the last frontier."
Juhani Missonen has a brisk business flying rich Muscovites and their families for weekends in Finland or Cyprus. "I charge $52,000 to fly a family of, say, five, to Kuusamo," he said, referring to a Finnish winter resort. And there are enough rich Russians who can pay such prices for a three-day vacation to make his Euro-file Ltd. a very profitable venture, he added.
Indeed, Russian tourists are flocking to Finland. More people visited from Russia last year than from anywhere else, accounting for 232,000 nights' stays and spending an average of more than $600 a person, according to Pekka Korpinen, deputy Mayor of Helsinki. The Japanese came in second in numbers and spent less -- about $450 each.
Fears that crime would spill over from Russia have not been realized.
"If the Mafia comes here, it seems they come to rest, not to fight," said Oli Kivinen, foreign editor of Helsingin Sanomat, the largest Finnish daily. "We have got the Russians but not their troubles. It is as if Finland has been declared a trouble-free zone. The deal is you are welcome, but leave the guns at home. And they respect it."

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
A Labor-Friendly Fund Helps to Channel the Power of Unions

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
LABOR DAY is still seen largely as a blue-collar, big-shoulders kind of holiday, even though the overwhelming majority of its celebrants are largely disassociated from the principles of the organized work force.
According to the Labor Department, there were slightly more than 16 million union members at work in the country last year, about 14.1 percent of all workers. The proportion of union workers has been steadily declining since 1953, when it was nearly 27 percent. 
 Despite these statistics, labor lives. Witness recent strikes against General Motors and Bell Atlantic and the current action against Northwest Airlines. Even the mutual fund industry is taking labor seriously.
Four years ago, MFS Investment Management embraced an investing strategy formulated by a member of the longshoremen's union in Savannah, Ga., and created the Union Standard Equity fund.
"I invest in a list of companies that meet certain criteria that are labor-friendly," said Mitchell D. Dynan, who has managed the fund since January 1997.
Those criteria were established by Robert Eason, a longshoreman and a trustee of his union's pension fund who was frustrated at the sight of his pension money being invested in companies with bad labor relations. He developed a number of litmus tests to determine a company's relative labor friendliness.
Among the labor-friendly benchmarks for the portfolio: at least 5 percent of a company's employees must be unionized; the company cannot be involved in a strike or lockout; it cannot make products that are on the boycott list of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.; it must meet certain health, safety and labor laws, and it must not show a pattern of outsourcing -- the transfer of work to other companies. The fund only buys American companies.
Screening is done by an advisory board of senior labor officials, academics and outside company managers; Labor Research Inc., a division of American Capital Strategies of Bethesda, Md., supplies the results to Mr. Dynan.
The list that they compile, the Labor Sensitivity Index, has a total of about 540 stocks. Mr. Dynan culls that list to 65 to 70.
But last December, the investment parameters were relaxed somewhat.
"Until December 1997, I had to be 100 percent invested in the companies on this list," Mr. Dynan said. "At that point the board gave me a little more flexibility and now allows me to invest up to 20 percent of the fund's assets in financial services and technology, industries in which there is very little unionization."
NOT surprisingly, unions have warmed to the fund, which now has $88 million under management. "Unions have always had tremendous pension power," said A. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services. "But I don't think that in the past it has been used terribly effectively for the rank and file."
Initially handling only public and labor union pension plans, the fund was opened to retail investors in August 1997; the minimum investment is $1,000.
Still, about 90 percent of the fund's assets are from unions, including the American Federation of Musicians and Employers Pension Fund, the Transportation Workers Union and the International Alliance of Theater Stage Employees.
For individuals, the fund carries hefty sales charges -- a 5.75 percent maximum front-end sales charge on its class A shares, for example. But results have been attractive. For the three years ended Thursday, the average annual return of the fund's institutional shares was 21.5 percent, versus 16.7 percent for the average fund in its category of large-capitalization blend funds, which tend to buy big-company stocks and pursue both value and growth investing styles, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher. While the fund lagged behind the 22.2 percent return of the Standard & Poor's 500 over that period, it has beaten the index's return so far this year -- 2.8 percent versus 2.2 percent as of Thursday.
Mr. Dynan and his predecessor, William Harris, have achieved this record by concentrating their holdings in large-cap stocks, the kind that until recently, at least, were among the best performers in the steady advance of major market indexes.
Mr. Dynan also likes to see a large amount of executive and employee ownership of a stock and prefers high-visibility companies in "recurring revenue" businesses, like supermarkets, which can be fairly certain what they are going to earn over the next six to nine months.
"I like to buy well-positioned companies in good businesses," he said. "And I would rather pay a little more to buy the No. 1-ranked company in that business than No. 3."
And he also likes businesses that generate lots of free cash, or cash after capital spending and dividends.
"This is a pretty conservative portfolio, and I want to maintain it that way," Mr. Dynan said. "That is my investment style. Also, right now I am cautious about the economy."
The fund's four biggest holdings are citadels of American capitalism: General Electric, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Exxon and Coca-Cola.
Since being allowed to invest in financial-service and high-technology companies, Mr. Dynan, who also serves as co-manager of the Massachusetts Financial Services Investors Trust, has added insurers like Allstate Insurance and Hartford Financial Services Group and banks like U.S. Bancorp, National City Corporation and Washington Mutual.
He also put about 1.5 percent of the fund into Microsoft and 1 percent in BMC Software. "Those stocks have definitely contributed" to the fund's performance, he said.
While the market's recent downward spike is a source of concern, Mr. Dynan said that as a buy-and-hold investor, "I don't try and call the market; I invest in companies."
Reflecting his cautious view about the economy, Mr. Dynan has overweighted the fund in consumer staples companies, the largest sector grouping, at nearly 20 percent of the portfolio. Industrial cyclicals account for nearly a quarter of the portfolio, and energy stocks are well over 10 percent, Morningstar said.
As of late last week, Mr. Dynan said he was not selling stocks to raise cash, despite the market's slide and his worries about the effects of the Asian and Russian financial crises on corporate earnings.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS IN TURMOIL: THE I.P.O. MARKET;
Many Newcomers Are Grounded by Turbulence

BYLINE: By SANA SIWOLOP 

 BODY:
A PEEK at the Equity New Issue Calendar on a Bloomberg terminal last week read like a departure monitor at a fogged-in airport. "Postponed." "Delayed." "Canceled." Indeed, as stocks struggled to climb back after Monday's selloff, not one company ventured onto the public markets last week.
"Right now I would say the window is closed," said Andy Kessler, a co-founder of Velocity Capital Management in Palo Alto, Calif. 
 John E. Fitzgibbon Jr., editor of The IPO Reporter, a newsletter, agreed. "What's going on in this market?" he asked. "Nothing, absolutely nothing. The hurricane shutters are down."
Four companies that postponed planned stock or units offerings last week were Datalink, a maker of data storage devices; Galacticomm Technologies, an on-line communications software maker; Gary Player Golf, a golf club marketer, and Sunbelt Automotive Group, a car retailer.
Datalink, Gary Player and Galacticomm said late last week that they would wait until the second half of September before considering an initial offering. A spokeswoman for Sunbelt did not say when it would reapproach the market.
In fact, last week's shutdown follows a month of dismal fortune for I.P.O.'s. The Securities Data Company said that only 19 came to market in August, raising a total of $1.33 billion. By contrast, there were 49 in August 1997, raising $2.86 billion. And even as recently as July, 46 companies managed to break out of the gate, raising $3.89 billion.
Prices for recent offerings are grounded, too. According to Mr. Fitzgibbon, as of Aug. 31 only two of the I.P.O.'s in the month were trading over their offering prices: Jenkon International, a software concern, and Geocities, the Internet company that helps individuals create their own Web sites.
Mr. Fitzgibbon said the 19 stocks that went public in August lost 20.4 percent of their value by month's end, on average, with the worst performance turned in by Pilot Network Services. That company, which provides secure Internet access services for on-line businesses, was initially priced at $14 on Aug. 11, opened at $13 and closed on Friday at $6.875.
"August was a blood bath," Mr. Fitzgibbon said.
And even those lucky holders of Geocities and Jenkon were put through the wringer. Geocities jumped to $37.3125 from its offering price of $17 on Aug. 11, peaked at $51.375 the next day and closed on Friday at less than half that amount. Jenkon rose to $5.53125 on Aug. 11 from its offering price of $5, hit a high of $6.375 on Aug. 26 and closed at $5.75 on Friday.
Among the biggest losers in the current selloff are investors who signed so-called lock-up agreements, agreeing that they will not sell their holdings for 180 days. Many who did saw their holdings rise and then were forced to sit on their hands as their positions collapsed in the last few months.
"All private-round investors are being asked to sign these agreements these days," Mr. Kessler said. But when markets tumble, he added, the lock-ups can cause newly issued stocks to sink out of sight once anxious investors flee.
"In the current market, anyone who's locked up is going to be out of luck," he said.
So what does September hold for prospective I.P.O. investors? The period after Labor Day has traditionally been popular for initial offerings, and until recently, the calendar for the fall looked full. At the end of August, for example, The IPO Reporter had more than 70 offerings on its September list.
Mr. Kessler, however, said he believed half of those prospective I.P.O.'s would be postponed. The current lineup, meanwhile, is weighted heavily toward very small companies, with scant operating histories, trying to take their stocks public without the backing of large, well-known underwriters. Underwriters' support can be crucial in determining an offering's success.
I.P.O. experts still see a number of high-profile, potentially well-grounded deals on the horizon. But they say it is unlikely that any one deal will lift the I.P.O. market out of its doldrums. And that includes the much-anticipated proposed offering by Goldman, Sachs & Company. The offering is expected to bring in $2.5 billion or more, although details are still being worked out. A spokesman for Goldman said the firm's plans remain unchanged.
Mr. Fitzgibbon predicted that Goldman, Sachs "is going to be a class act onto itself."
Of course, if the market picks up significantly this month, the I.P.O. outlook will likely follow suit, regardless of what Goldman does, analysts say. Mr. Fitzgibbon, for one, thinks a new round of internet companies will be going public in the coming months. Indeed, such offerings have fared better than those of other companies in the market's downturn.
But don't hold your breath. A survey of the top 15 underwriters by Bloomberg Financial Markets showed that none of them planned I.P.O.'s for this week.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS IN TURMOIL: THE PSYCHOLOGY;
Feeling Handcuffed, Many Stay Put

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
FOR many investors, the choice of whether to sell or hold fast as stocks swooned in the last two weeks felt like no choice at all: For better or worse, they said, they were handcuffed to the market by a need to avoid taking taxable gains or locking in devastating losses.
Michael Matheson, 51, who does voice-overs for commercials in Chicago, is one long-term investor whose resolve was severely tested. 
 "I was sitting on my ledge, thinking about jumping," joked Mr. Matheson after last Monday's 512-point dive in the Dow Jones industrial average.
But once Mr. Matheson considered his alternatives, he decided to leave his stock investments -- about 60 percent of his portfolio -- where they were.
"I can't imagine locking in these losses," he said. "If I sold now, I'd be sitting here with a pile of cash and asking, 'What would I do with it?' "
In years gone by, a slide in major market indexes like the one culminating in Monday's selloff would have sent Mr. Matheson and many small investors like him stampeding for the exits, scrambling to sell shares and seeking triage for their ailing portfolios.
But this time around, with a record number of Americans having a record amount of their net worth in equities, many investors stayed with their stocks, saying there was nowhere else to go for the double-digit returns they have come to expect. Even for those with less exaggerated aims, "there aren't too many good alternatives" to the stock market, said Dan Seto, senior economist at Nikko Securities International.
For many investors, today's money and credit markets don't seem to qualify. A flight to safety, brought on by the stock market's tumble and turmoil in foreign financial markets, has pushed yields on Treasury bonds to their lowest levels in two decades. Bank certificates of deposit are no better, with one-year C.D.'s yielding 4.92 percent, on average.
Commodities, too, are seen as unattractive. Commodity markets are perceived as risky and forbidding for ordinary investors, while prices of oil, gold and many other commodities are depressed, with few signs that broad rallies are imminent.
In fact, some investors point to low interest rates and cheap oil as positive economic signs that should help stocks rebound soon, resuscitating their battered stock portfolios.
But by clinging to such thinking, the investors may be whistling in the wind, while whatever profits are left in their stocks evaporate or their losses escalate.
"So far, in the last few years, they've been correct: Long-term investing has proven to be beneficial and profitable," said Larry Rice, chief investment officer at Josephthal & Company. But history also teaches that investor complacency about declines can be costly, he warned.
"There's not enough fear yet; most of the investing public has not seen a bear market," Mr. Rice said, adding that in such strong downturns, investors usually wind up capitulating and selling very close to the bottom. Then mutual funds that had been hoarding cash start buying stocks anew.
"The worst thing you can say is that this time it's going to be different than every other cycle in history," Mr. Rice said.
But some investors think it is already too late to sell.
While many analysts say stocks still have further to slide, most view the remaining downside as fairly limited. If so, selling now could be a sure way for investors to maximize near-term losses.
"It's too late," asserted Duke Jupiter, 34, a stockbroker in Scottsdale, Ariz. "If you sold that first day, you could have rode this out. But the losses would be too steep now and there's not much more downside. If you get out now and it comes back, you're going to miss out."
For many people who have been invested in stocks for a while, losses are not the issue. Even after the market's fall from July's record highs through Monday, a slide that erased more than $2 trillion in value from the 30 Dow companies and more than $588 billion from Nasdaq shares -- or nearly all the year's gains -- many investors continue to have sizable, if smaller, gains in individual stocks. And they are reluctant to sell now and take a hefty capital gains tax hit.
Helen G. Bradley, 66, of Jacksonville, Fla., said she was "trying not to make any actual profits outside of my I.R.A." for tax reasons. In other words, Ms. Bradley does not want to compound the damage done by the market's slide by surrendering a big chunk of her portfolio that is not in an individual retirement account to the Internal Revenue Service through capital gains taxes on sales of stock. Although prices have fallen, they are still higher than the prices she paid for her shares years ago.
Some stocks, like Apple Computer and Dell Computer, are still up more than 100 percent this year, while others, like Gap, Lucent Technologies, Cisco Systems and Worldcom, are up more than 50 percent. The short-term capital gains tax could -- at the maximum rate -- slice a hefty 39.6 percent of that away.
Even at the flat 20 percent long-term capital gains tax rate, which now kicks in for stocks owned more than 12 months, a sizable chunk of gains could be taken.
In part because of recent tax law changes, which are retroactive to Jan. 1, there is less that an investor can do to lock in stock gains and avoid a big tax bite, said Robert Willens, a tax and accounting analyst at Lehman Brothers.
An investor can still buy a put option to hedge against losses, but buying one for a stock owned less than 12 months will erase all of the accumulated time the stock has been owned before it can qualify for the lower long-term capital gains rate, Mr. Willens said.
Another alternative strategy, called shorting against the box, which is used to carry a profit into the next tax year, has become more restrictive, he added.
And then there are the investors who are frozen in the market by nothing more than ticker shock. "It's been so bad, I don't even want to know what I've lost," said Deborah Bernstein, head of sales for the colored-stones division of Kimberly Created Emeralds in Manhattan.
"Once I saw it go beyond something I could handle, I stopped looking," Ms. Bernstein said. She made an ill-timed first foray into the stock market two weeks before last October's decline of 500-plus points, buying individual shares of companies like Oracle, Staten Island Bancorp and Atmel. Atmel, a specialty computer chip maker, in particular has been routed since she bought it, falling more than 60 percent this year alone.
"Once it gets better, I think I'm going to sell everything and start over," she said. But not now.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
That Deflationary Feeling

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
"Bear markets never happen when interest rates fall." This argument has been trotted out in the last few months by all manner of Wall Street strategists, perhaps to calm nervous investors as they watched their portfolios drift lower.
Trouble is, it's not exactly accurate. 
 Although it is unusual for stocks to decline in tandem with interest rates, it is by no means impossible, as recent weeks have shown. From the peak of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index on July 17 to Friday's close, the market has lost 17.9 percent of its value. At the same time, interest rates have made a huge move down, with yields on the 30-year Treasury bond falling to 5.28 percent, from 5.74 percent.
A similar fate befell stock and bond investors in another great bull market, said Louise Yamada, director and senior technical analyst at Salomon Smith Barney -- the run in stocks that began in 1860 and lasted into the 1890's. The biggest bull market of that century is depicted in the accompanying chart, courtesy of the Security Research Company in Wellesley Hills, Mass.
After moving up smartly during the 1860's, the stock market reached a peak in 1872. At the time, bond yields were falling. There was no Federal debt yet -- imagine! -- but yields on railroad bonds and other benchmark issues fell to 4 percent, from about 5 percent. Yet despite the decline in interest rates, stocks lost 34 percent of their value in a bear phase that lasted until 1877. Then stocks began to climb again.
This history lesson helps explain why, contrary to popular wisdom, stocks can, indeed, fall alongside bond yields. The reason, in a word, is disinflation. The 1870's through the 1890's were one of the nation's longest periods of steady, even falling, prices, not too different from the situation today. As the Industrial Revolution unfolded, the United States General Price Level, that day's version of the Consumer Price Index, fell 1.3 percent a year, on average. Today, while consumer prices are up about 1.5 percent, producer prices have fallen about five-tenths of 1 percent in the last year.
The earlier period also parallels ours in that lower prices were accompanied by real gross domestic product growth and higher wages. Today it's a technology revolution that is producing those results.
In the last 50 years, investors have grown unfamiliar with the effects of deflation on stocks and bonds. In most people's memories, the American economy has been driven by scarcity; demand for goods has led supply. Manufacturers followed scarcity, producing goods that fetched the highest prices.
Now, excess capacity around the world is driving demand, argues James Paulsen, chief investment officer of Norwest Investment Management in Minneapolis. "Wherever prices are falling fastest, like technology, it brings more demand," he said.
Great for consumers, but not for corporations. Those unable to cut costs fast enough show profit declines. "As long as prices are falling slowly, corporations can adjust," Mr. Paulsen said. "If prices fall sharply, they can't." Which is where we may be now.
As the stock price recovery in 1877 proves, companies can adjust to disinflation. As demand catches up with supply, stocks stabilize.
Where does that leave investors today? "There are certainly signs that this is a bear market," Ms. Yamada said. "But we don't have enough evidence to suggest that it's the end of the secular bull market that began in 1982." It may simply be a painful but temporary period in which companies adjust to falling prices. When they do, stocks can move up again.
If history repeats, stocks have further to fall. Then, get ready for the rebound.

Japan's Prescription for Crisis: Be Timid! Be Timid! But Not Too Timid!

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN 

 BODY:
The frantic American efforts to get Japan to act boldly to cure its financial crisis remind me of the time my mother got sick in Japan and was rushed to the hospital, where the Japanese doctors' best attempts to reassure her went awry.
As the doctors called for a battery of sophisticated tests, my mother mistakenly assumed they were following the American practice of testing only when something worrisome is suspected. Visibly anxious, she asked what was wrong. The doctors thought she was doubting their thoroughness, so they ordered even more tests. The more the doctors tried to reassure my mother, the worse she felt. 
 The same wide cultural gap afflicts the anguished dialogue between American and Japanese financial officials. The United States is demanding root canal surgery on Japanese banks as the best way to instill confidence in the system. The more banks shut down, the more bad loans disclosed and written off, the better. Japan counters that these steps will lead to panic, bank withdrawals and declining confidence in the nation's economic future -- the opposite of what is intended.
Washington and Wall Street worry that Japan's anemic financial policies are likely to keep its economy moribund and prevent recovery throughout Asia, possibly leading to a financial collapse that will make the recent turmoil in world markets look like a warm-up. Indeed, as Kenneth Courtis of Deutsche Bank has noted, Japan is more internationally isolated today than at any time since the 1930's.
Japan's problems are summed up in the career of Kiichi Miyazawa, the 78-year-old former Prime Minister brought in by the new Prime Minister, Keizo Obuchi, to oversee the economy. Sharp, charming and unflappable -- as anyone who watched him cradle a sick President George Bush in his arms in 1991 will long remember -- Mr. Miyazawa began his career as a young Finance Ministry bureaucrat after the war who resented being lectured to by Gen. Douglas MacArthur. In his memoirs he wrote that "it may be hard for young people today to understand how unpleasant it was to live under the occupation."
Any such person is unlikely to listen to American lectures, even during a crisis. But because Mr. Miyazawa is considered a giant who helped nurture the Japanese postwar miracle of state-supported capitalism, with all its coziness and impenetrability, he is especially unlikely to walk away today from a system that he feels brought Japan back from the rubble and defeat of World War II. People who know him say he embraces the "soft landing" school of Japanese finance, in that he feels a little more stimulus, and a little more openness in its banking system, will pull Japan out of its slump without causing undue panic.
The problem, according to American officials, is that the most recent Japanese program is barely enough to reverse the negative effects of Japan's ill-timed tax hike last year. Moreover, Japanese officials are still debating the criteria for auditing the nation's ailing banks, a bit late considering that this is the seventh year of the Japanese slump. Tokyo has acknowledged bad debts of $550 billion, but American officials and private experts say they actually approach $1 trillion.
Japanese inaction goes beyond the cultural to the political. Those in power in Japan have a strong vested interest in the status quo. The all-powerful Finance Ministry has no desire to shed control over the economy. Like Mr. Miyazawa, Finance Ministry alumni who have gone on to wield power in business and politics tend instinctively to look out for the ministry's interests.
Mr. Miyazawa superintends these interests at the Liberal Democratic Party, which has dominated Japan for nearly all of the last 45 years. Like the old saying about the Holy Roman Empire being neither holy nor Roman nor an empire, the ruling party is not liberal or democratic. It is less a party than a collection of special interests, from farmers to small businesses, giant corporations and organized crime, who supply money and resources to the party in return for its protection. That circle of self-interest serves as a powerful shield against demands for change.
Add to all these factors the traditional Japanese belief in the importance of consensus, and it is easy to see why radical reform is difficult. I have seen schoolchildren spending so much time trying to choose sides fairly for a baseball game that there is no time left for the game. The world economy, of course, is not a game right now. But if Russia is a onetime superpower flailing about for solutions, the Japanese spectacle is one of deep-rooted inertia in the face of genuine crisis.

HEADLINE: Word for Word/Books About Walking;
Take a Hike! Can't You See I'm Reading?

BYLINE: By TOM KUNTZ 

 BODY:
WALKING seems simple: You take your right foot and place it ahead of your left. Then you take your left foot and place it ahead of your right. Locomotion ensues. You may wish to vary the starting foot. Left, right -- It's up to you.
The point is, walking is a lot less complicated than the hokey-pokey, but you don't see a lot of books written about the hokey-pokey, even though pretty much everybody has to dance it at weddings, sometimes drunk. 
 Walking, on the other hand, has inspired dozens of books as well as a glossy magazine in recent years -- a response to an increasingly aging, sedentary and obese population that recognizes the need to get off its collective keister but also says, "Hey, let's not overdo it."
And so, as walking has assumed a lucrative, baby-boomerish niche in the consumer economy, this simple activity, in typically American fashion, has become rocket science, brain surgery, quasi-religious ritual and organizing principle of life all rolled into one. At least, that's the impression you come away with after perusing volumes like those excerpted below, lugged back to the office after a recent foray into one of Manhattan's book superstores. Before trying this or any other strenuous activity, consult your physician. TOM KUNTZ
How-to-Walk Book No. 1: "The 90-Day Fitness Walking Program" by Mark Fenton and Seth Bauer (Perigee, 1995, 188 pages)
Sample Workout: Day 1 . . . Walk out of your door and walk for five minutes in any direction at any speed. Then turn around and come home. That's it. You're done.
How-to-Walk Book No. 2: "Walking: A Complete Guide to the Complete Exercise" by Casey Meyers (Random House, 1992, 313 pages)
Quote: I have worked with thousands of people in walking clinics coast to coast. During this time two things have struck me as funny. First, everybody drove to the clinic to learn how to walk, and second, almost all knew more about how their cars functioned than about how their bodies did.
How-to-Walk Book No. 3: "Walk Yourself Well" by Sherry Brourman, P.T., with Randy Rodman (Hyperion, 1998, 292 pages)
Quote: Every step we take has two phases: a stance phase and a swing phase. The stance phase is the part of walking when the foot is touching the ground. The three parts to the stance phase are: (1) heel strike, when only the heel is on the ground; (2) mid-stance, when the foot and toes come to the ground; and (3) pushoff, when the foot lifts onto the toe, which bend, squeeze down, and propel us forward, mostly with the big and middle toe.
The swing phase is everything that happens between the time that the toes go airborne until the heel of the same foot strikes the ground again. Both stance and swing phases play a primary role in propelling us forward with optimal balance.
How-to-Walk Book No. 4: "Walking Fast: Techniques and Workouts for High-Level Fitness and Performance" by Therese Iknoian (Human Kinetics, 1998, 183 pages)
Quote: Walking is walking. That's it. You might go faster, or you might go slower, but if you're putting one foot in front of the other for your health, fitness or performance, you're walking.
How-to-Walk Book No. 5: "Walking" by Ruth Rudner (Human Kinetics, 1996, 120 pages)
Quote: One bright autumn Sunday afternoon, I left the village of Igls, a couple of miles from and a thousand feet above Innsbruck in the Austrian Tyrol, to go for a walk. The air was crisp, the world shimmering with the gold of larch trees and birches. The pretty forest path was well-trod by about 200 years of walkers. I was headed for a mountain hut a few miles distant for an afternoon of coffee and cake. On the way, I came upon an old woman walking up the path, holding the hand of a tiny girl. The girl was little enough that walking must have been a new activity for her. The two kept pace with one another, their footsteps matching. It struck me, in that moment, that I was seeing the ending and the beginning of life; that the rhythm of age and childhood were in accord; and that all of this was happening on foot.
How-to-Walk Book No. 6: "JayWalking: the Ultimate Fitness Journey" by Jay Ciniglio (Berkley, 1998, 137 pages)
Quote: The beauty of JayWalking is that it is a state of mind, as well as a philosophy, and can be done anytime and anywhere, in any footwear.
How-to-Walk Book No. 7: "The Spirited Walker: Fitness Walking for Clarity, Balance and Spiritual Connection" by Carolyn Scott Kortge (HarperSanFrancisco, 1998, 253 pages)
Quote: When you've had a day filled with activity and what you need most is to quiet your mind so that you can reconnect with nature -- and with your own divine nature -- experiment with contemplative walking meditation. Pick a location where you can focus fully on your steps. It might be a hallway or your living room. Perhaps you know a quiet path outdoors. Lower your eyes and turn your attention to your steps. Walk slowly, counting each step in a pattern of one to four. When your attention strays, simply begin the count again. Or focus on your breathing, blocking out mental chatter by thinking "in" as you inhale and "out" as you release each breath.
Thich Nhat Hanh, Vietnamese Buddhist monk and peace activist, teaches meditation students to plant peace and happiness on the Earth with each step. . . . Be aware of your foot touching the ground and consciously imprint peace with each step. Think about leaving footprints that heal the earth.
How-to-Walk Book No. 8: "The Rugged Walker: Great Workouts for the Great Outdoors" by Patricia Kirk (Human Kinetics, 1998, 201 pages)
Quote: Walking the rugged path has led me on a journey that travels deep into the unfolding of who I am.
 
Groucho-Based Exercises:
Groucho Walk . . . Start walking, then bend your knees so you are in a deep lunge position. Make sure your knees stay over your heels (forming a 90-degree or wider angle at the knee) as you step forward. Walk quickly in this squat position while pumping your arms.
Groucho Lay-Ups . . . Take three Groucho steps beginning with your right foot, then hop on the third step (on your right foot), bringing your left knee up and landing on your foot again. When you land, be sure to bend your knees to help absorb the impact. Take three Groucho steps beginning with your left foot, hop on your third step (on your left foot). Pump the arms as you Groucho-walk and then swing them wider or shoot them overhead, as in basketball, when you hop. Continue to step-step-step-shoot (on the count of 1, 2, 3, 4).
Backward Groucho Walking Uphill . . . Be sure the way is clear of debris. Crouch low into the knees (however, avoid bending too low and putting stress on the knee) and Groucho-walk up the hill backward.
How-to-Walk Book No. 9: "Walk It Off! 20 Minutes a Day to Health and Fitness" by Suzanne Levine, D.P.M. (Plume/Penguin, 1990, 257 pages)
Sample Walking Type: The Sensual Stroller . . . For this one, think Marilyn Monroe or Elvis Presley. Your whole body is alive with pleasure as you walk. You feel your lithe limbs moving under your clothes. You step forward with a slinky roll, leading with your hips, your arms gracefully flowing forward and back with each sensuous unfolding of your thighs.
You move like a graceful tiger, leisurely but calculating. . . . You're beautiful and desirable, and you know it. You're humming something provocative, like "Mama Said There'd Be Days Like This" or "The Girl From Ipanema." You know you look marvelous. You're in the mood for love.
How-to-Walk Book No. 10: "Walk Yourself Thin" by David A. Rives (Moon River, 1998, 149 pages)
Quote: First of all, it really is a fact of life: If you're going to get thin, you're going to have to control something! If you don't want to control the amount you eat, then you're going to have to control the amount you exercise. There's no getting around it.
"Oh, poop!"
Postscript: Perhaps walking isn't for you. In that case, you might consider books like "The Art of Breathing" by Nancy Zi (Vivi, 1997), or even "The Art of Doing Nothing" by Veronique Vienne (Clarkson Potter, 1998), which includes chapters on lounging, napping and yawning.

HEADLINE: A Fright-Free Social Security Screenplay

BYLINE: By Richard C. Leone; Richard C. Leone is president of the Century Foundation.

 BODY:
The only sure bet about the next century is the eventual premiere of "Friday the 13th, Part 65." The movie, scripted by a policy wonk, features retired baby boomers with ravenous appetites for more Social Security and Medicare. The previews for this thriller are already at a town meeting near you.
The story line is familiar: the biggest generation ever retires, bankrupting social programs and overburdening those young enough to remain in the work force. This being Hollywood, of course, there's a cliffhanger ending in which "President" Bruce Willis saves the nation by replacing traditional Social Security with individual stock market accounts. 
 A flashback sequence is set in present-day Washington. On every street corner there's a think tank "expert" spouting optimistic estimates of future stock market returns, skipping over audience downers like market volatility and management fees. These experts also ignore the possibility that, while stocks generally are a good long-term investment, individual retirees may leave their jobs just when the market is enduring a "normal correction."
But what about an alternate story, with an easier way out -- one that involves a lot less danger? Instead of leaving each Social Security investor on his own, why not simply pool the market risks by investing part of existing Social Security trust funds in equities? (Now, of course, the trust fund money is 100 percent in Treasury securities.)
This way, if the rosy scenarios are correct, diversification could eliminate shortfalls in Social Security throughout the 21st century. If they're not, this approach still reduces the costs of investment to a minimum and permits the most flexibility for coping with market gyrations. All retirees continue to receive a guaranteed benefit level because a national fund, investing for all of us over the long haul, can smooth out even the biggest bumps in the market.
Even privatizers acknowledge the attractiveness of diversification, but they, like Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, are wary of the threat of "Socialism." Suppose the Government -- in the form of the Social Security trust funds -- winds up owning too much of American companies' stock?
Well, first, how credible is this threat? After all, 90 percent of all Social Security contributions are now paid out to current beneficiaries. A buildup of the trust funds -- or private accounts -- is impossible without additional revenue, through either new taxes or lower benefits. What this means is that there may not be all that much cash to invest in the market.
It also means that the trust funds, if diversified, probably would never own more than 5 percent of the equity market. Moreover, trust fund money could be passively invested in a broad index and overseen by a long-serving, nonpartisan board. State pension funds, unions and the Federal thrift program today own more equities than ever, and somehow American capitalism has survived rather nicely.
Finally, remember that the projected shortfall in Social Security is forecast using a scenario of slow economic growth (less than 2 percent annually) in which the trust funds will be spent down to zero in a generation.
One can construct alternate projections, based on higher expectations about future wages and the market, in which the trust funds amass large equity holdings. Some privatizers conclude that, under such boom conditions, we should cut payroll taxes, thus keeping the size of the trust funds down.
The problem with that idea is that the taxes flowing into the trust funds add to net national savings, and such savings help fuel long-term growth. A tax cut would inevitably reduce savings, since people never save 100 percent of a tax cut. That would impede long-term growth.
So to promote high levels of savings and to provide the money to meet future Social Security obligations, I propose a different way to cope with "too much of a good thing." Whenever the securities in the trust funds exceed the amount necessary to keep the program whole for a given period, the excess could be credited to new individual accounts for each worker. These accounts would be add-ons to, not substitutes for, Social Security and subject to restrictions on early withdrawal.
Under this plan, retirees would still be guaranteed basic benefits, and trust fund equities could never become unwieldy. The social safety net would stay intact, savings would be preserved, and individuals would share in the upside of prosperity.
But is it a movie? No skin-of-our-teeth ending; no explosions. Probably even Disney wouldn't touch it.

Postcards From a What-Me-Worry Summer

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
SURE, Jamie Dimon, the co-chairman of Salomon Smith Barney, had to fly home from his August vacation in Europe when the market fell over 500 points last week. But after noodling with his Bloomberg terminal, and conferring with colleagues, he headed right back once the Dow regained some of its steadiness.
Suzanne Daub, owner of Nantucket.net, an Internet cafe on the Massachusetts island, noticed in recent weeks more people coming in to check stock quotes -- most with a beach towel on one arm and a smile. 
 Now is the summer of our blithe ambivalence.
On the surface, the country has been faced with weeks of turmoil. "If someone sat down on July 4th and made a list of predictions for the political and economic outlook, most of them would have been wrong," said David Blitzer, chief economist at Standard & Poor's Corporation in New York. "Everyone thought Monica Lewinsky would go away, she didn't. We thought we knew Russian policy. People thought the Asia crisis was taking a step back, but it reawakened."
Yet Americans are far from depressed. News about falling currencies, market fluctuations and sexual peccadilloes seem less harbingers of bad times than distractions from the steak and hot dogs on the grill. While a few polls indicate that some Americans are concerned about the distant future, the reigning sentiment out there now is one of relative satisfaction.
"The public feels the media is out of touch with day-to-day life," said Michael Harrison, editor of Talkers Magazine, a trade publication for talk radio and television shows. "It is a time of uncertainty, but people base their confidence or lack of it based on what is happening in their own lives."
So where is the outrage, as Bob Dole once demanded? It is apparently limited to those beachgoers vexed by the twittering cellular phones of their neighbor on the next towel.
"People were pacing back and forth on the beach in East Hampton looking very stressed," said Jason Weisenfeld, an executive at Barneys New York. "It was very out of character."
But that is not the lot of most Americans. Though more of them own mutual funds today than before, most are passive investors, doing pretty much what their broker tells them, and are in for the long term. Those sophisticated enough to manage their own money are far too wealthy to let one downturn scare them.
With the horrific exception of recent terrorist bombings and last week's airplane crash, many crises of the summer of 1998 have lacked human drama. Who will say, as they did with the death of Princess Diana, "Where were you when Russia devalued the ruble?"
Some, though, simply see opportunity in the losses. "With the Asia collapse, everyone says it is terrible," said Richard Gelfond, the co-chief executive of the Imax Corporation, in a phone interview from his home in Southampton. "We are saying to theater owners that real estate prices there have fallen so much that they can open theaters at a fraction of the cost."
People who were more connected to the economic vicissitudes had their summer vacations marred. "When the world's events are dominating the news, taking a vacation is not going to happen," lamented Lisa R. Berkowitz, the vice president and director of marketing and communications for Harper Business, a unit of HarperCollins, the publisher. "Between the stock market and Russia, everyone in public relations cringes. You're afraid to leave the office."
Then there are those who have taken vacations to give the appearance of indifference to crisis -- only to have to cut them short. Like Bill Clinton. Bringing his problems with him like so much carry-on luggage, he went to Martha's Vineyard -- a place where others may have been trying to escape him -- then promptly returned home to deal with military action against terrorist targets.
Speaking of politics, things could be better. "It has been a rough summer for political folks," said Chris Lapetina, a partner at Global Strategy Group, a democratic polling firm in New York, where a primary election is just around the corner. "Those who think about the global financial situation are thinking about that more than the political situation here, and that is very frustrating for our candidates. People just are not focused in at all."
And while many chief executives are relaxing at their summer homes, some of the workers in Wall Street's trenches -- brokers, traders and analysts -- will respond to the question of what they did this summer with one word -- panic.
"I am a prisoner of my own vacation," lamented Thomas H. Hanley, a managing director at Warburg Dillon Read, who analyzes bank stocks. "First, there was Hurricane Bonnie. Then, there was the market. Calls. Faxes. Messages. Traders. Media. I've been doing this for many years, but this has been the most difficult summer I can remember in 25 years." Mr. Hanley was so stressed he recently locked himself out of his Southampton house.
Abby Joseph Cohen, the investment strategist at Goldman, Sachs & Company, simply took her computer along on vacation. During market turmoil in early August, she sent reassuring faxes from Israel to clients. "Nothing ruined my wonderful trip," she said. "I don't ever really turn off. I go into standby mode."

HEADLINE: The Nation: Confidence Counts;
Everybody's Measuring Consumer Fears. Big Deal.

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
LAST week, as the stock market tumbled, President Clinton's political embarrassments deepened and Russia's financial crisis snowballed, the biggest fear suddenly became fear itself.
Never mind that the economy is in its best shape in decades, that unemployment and inflation are remarkably low, the budget is balanced and the Federal Reserve is content to leave interest rates alone. The newest worry is that all the scary headlines will so unnerve consumers -- whose spending has been a key source of the economy's strength in recent years -- that sheer pessimism will keep them away from malls, car dealerships and the housing market, igniting a recession. 
 "It's about psychology as opposed to money," said Nicholas Perna, chief economist at Fleet Bank. "I'm absolutely convinced that people identify the stock market with the economy. When the market is tanking, they know things can't be good."
 
A Case of Vapors
Mr. Perna, revealing something of a pessimistic streak himself, said he expected the economy to turn extremely sluggish or worse. But the notion that a national case of the vapors -- as opposed to a scarcity of jobs, income or wealth -- can cause an otherwise healthy economy to swoon calls for some skepticism.
As David Wyss, chief economist at Standard & Poor's DRI, put it late last week, "As far as getting spooked, it takes an awful lot to scare an American."
 
Historic Highs
Economic forecasters track two monthly indexes of consumer confidence religiously. Even though economists disagree on how important consumer confidence is and even what the indexes measure, they agree that confidence has been hovering at historical highs for the past few years and that spending has been remarkably strong.
The older survey of confidence, begun in 1947, is conducted by the University of Michigan. The newer one was started in the late 1960's by the Conference Board, a New York-based research organization, and is more familiar to the public.
Each employs slightly different sampling techniques, asks different questions and tabulates its results at different times of the month. The Michigan survey is available only to paying clients, while the Conference Board's index is released to the press.
In trying to gauge consumer confidence, the surveyors are actually trying to capture the expectations of households in three basic areas: personal finance, economic conditions and buying conditions. Both surveys ask five questions, but add others from time to time to monitor consumers' changing concerns.
In the Michigan survey, two questions focus on the respondents' financial situation. Two other questions have to do with opinions about overall economic conditions and the final one asks whether now is a good time to buy a major appliance. The Conference Board's questions focus more on job availability and less on personal finances.
Michigan conducts a phone survey of 500 households and the Conference Board mails questionnaires to 5,000 households, and after the answers are collected they are are combined into the indexes.
 
Parallel Track
Both confidence measures generally move in sync with consumer spending, and every recession has been preceded or accompanied by a sharp drop in confidence. Similarly, every recovery has been preceded or accompanied by a rebound in confidence.
Both the size and duration of the change in confidence make a difference. It takes about a 10 percent decline over a month or two to register as a significant shift, and it's not just the change in confidence but the level that counts. "Anything above 90 indicates strong spending," said Lynn Franco, an economist at the Conference Board.
In August, the Conference Board's index was 133, close to the high of 140 set in the late 1960's. "It could drop 20 points without necessarily signaling a sharp slowdown in spending," Ms. Franco said.
The Michigan index is close to 105, also near its high. But after last week's drop of 411.43 points in the Dow Jones industrial average, economists will be looking for signs of consumers' reaction in both September indexes.
 
Questions of Value
There is disagreement among economists as to whether confidence measures are useful for predicting future spending patterns or spotting turning points in the economy. The benchmark study of confidence, published in the American Economic Review shortly after the 1990-1991 recession, concluded that the indexes are useful but limited in value.
A more recent study by two economists at the New York Federal Reserve, Sydney Ludvigson and Jason Bram, suggests that the Conference Board index may be a more useful indicator. "Consumers seem to spend more when they feel good about future job prospects than they do when they think business conditions are favorable," Ms. Ludvigson said.
The most notable episode in which the consumer confidence index was the first true sign that the economy was heading into a recession was in the summer of 1990, when Iraq invaded Kuwait and oil prices doubled within a matter of days. Confidence plunged, and within weeks spending stalled and the economy was in a nose dive. Lots of economists, including the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, were caught by surprise.
Many drops in confidence are too small or too short to affect spending. When political events lead to drops in confidence at a time when the overall economy looks healthy, the drop is almost always temporary. In October 1987, for example, the Dow plunged 500 points, or 20 percent, in a single day, and the next month the Conference Board's index dropped 20 points, to nearly 100. But perhaps because an export boom was under way, consumers recovered their spirits within a couple of months, and the index bounced back.
Richard Curtin, the economist who runs the Michigan survey, points out that by the late 1980's consumers had figured out that employment, income and economic growth no longer moved in sync with the stock market -- as they had in the 1960's and 1970's. "In 1987, consumers saw no repercussions for income or employment growth from the stock market decline and therefore mostly ignored it," Mr. Curtin said.
At the same time, surges in confidence related to politically popular events but not supported by improvements in the economy also tend to be short-lived. Consumer confidence surged after the Persian Gulf war, but the indexes quickly fell again because the economy and job growth remained sluggish.
Other economists don't see much of a cause-and-effect relationship at all between confidence and spending, but see the indexes as useful nonetheless.
"Confidence is more of a summary measure of things that affect spending than a specific cause in its own right," said Ed McKelvey, an economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company in New York.
 
Helpful Previews
In general, forecasters say the real importance of measuring confidence has less to do with the power of psychology than the timeliness of the reports. Confidence surveys come out two weeks before the Government's monthly employment reports and a month to six weeks before reports on consumer spending.
If consumer sentiment reflects their perception of the job market and business conditions, then it is a convenient preliminary reading for economists.
"There's no denying it's important, but the main thing that makes it interesting is that it comes out on a timely basis," said one forecaster. "If you could see the September employment numbers or the Conference Board survey, you'd rather see the jobs numbers."

People usually spend more money when they feel the economy is in good shape. They're likely to save more of their money when they feel hard times are ahead. Measuring consumer confidence is one tool economists use to predict which way the economy is going. Graph measures an index of consumer confidence against six recessions since 1967.

HEADLINE: The Nation: Roll 'Em;
Feeling Secure Is a Risky Business

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AMERICANS who never fought a war or feared a depression could be forgiven for imagining a risk-free world. Living high and mighty, consuming more than their share of the world's food and fuel, feeling secure within their borders and even reasonably safe outside them, they could envision a boundless zone of security in which American money and power and culture and technology would insure some sort of peace.
But when markets tumble into turbulence, wiping out $4 trillion of the world's wealth, and a plane to Switzerland, home of stolid banks and precise watchworks, plummets from the sky, and the United States hurls missiles at an armed theosopher in Afghanistan, inviting retaliation against American emblems everywhere, the odds in the big casino can feel like they are shifting back to the house.
 
More to Lose
At least subconsciously, people calculate those odds every time they board a plane or take a flier. Today the well-off may have reason to feel at risk: They have more to lose, more creature comforts, more paper profits. Global crashes can stir the survivalist inside the most confident suburbanite. 
 Risk was a great thing when new worlds and new frontiers beckoned and the risk-takers had little to lose. Now millions of people crowd the coasts, living in more expensive properties built more shoddily than a generation ago, and more vulnerable to oceans and storms and quakes. Beyond the nation's borders, in the world's financial markets, people are also living nearer to the edge, in riskier ways, closer to the winds of rising storms. As prosperity has grown, risk has grown with it.
How do people deal with invisible global forces? Mostly, they don't.
"We have no reference point to calculate our probabilities," said Howard Kunreuther, co-director of the Center for Risk Management and Decision Processes at the Wharton School. "So, we forget. It's very costly to be scared every moment. We say, 'This isn't going to happen to me.' And then we're surprised if it happens."
Is the world really more risky than it was 40 years or 40 days ago? If so, why? As the rigid cold-war past melts into the fluid present, where the chances of being vaporized by a nuclear bomb from Vladivostok are down, but the chances of being wiped out by a currency crash in Jakarta are up, calibrating these dangers is complicated. It has energized an increasingly interesting field: risk analysis, a school of thought built from risky business: managing nuclear power, launching rockets, building dams, curing cancers, combating terrorists, buying insurance, managing mutual funds and pension plans, playing the markets -- the gamut of global gambles.
Risk, it turns out, can be quantified. But a sense of security cannot.
"What is risk?" asks Yacov Y. Haimes, president of the Society for Risk Analysis. "Risk is measurable, and composed of two parts: What could go wrong and what are the consequences? Now, safety is something else. Safety is the level of risk that's acceptable to you. Today in America we are seeking more comfort. We can afford more comfort. We expect more comfort. Go to Phoenix, in Arizona -- in a desert, they have lawns.
 
Linkages
"Now, is our world more dangerous?" he said. "It is. We are asking more of it, more comfort and therefore we are more vulnerable. The more secure we are, the more we feel the danger of losing our security. There are easy ways to inflict major pain with no major effort. People can intrude on our financial and national-security systems in much easier ways. This is because of the interconnectedness of the world and its infrastructures."
"This interlinkage," a Presidential commission warned in October, "has created a new dimension of vulnerability, which, when combined with an emerging constellation of threats, poses unprecedented national risk."
This more interwoven world may remind people of an old high-school biology lesson: that everything is connected to everything else. It calls to mind a principle of chaos theory -- that a butterfly flapping its wings in Mexico can set off a chain of disturbances that causes a hurricane in China. In the same way, a plunge in the Indonesian rupee causes chaos with the Russian ruble -- and, conceivably, with the United States Treasury, and millions of mutual funds, pension plans and young children's college savings.
"It's not only my small world any more," said Kathleen S. Gurney, chief executive officer of Financial Psychology Corp., which counsels investors, investment advisers and companies on risk-taking. "My world extends into places I have no way of gauging. I am dealing with psyches I don't understand any more. My sense of prediction is no longer as solid and as true for me. I don't have the same self-confidence I had two weeks ago. If I'm feeling this way, others must be feeling this way."
 
A Butterfly's Wings
Others in the world of the calculated risk do share that assessment. "In fact, there is more risk," said Tom Hutton, president of Risk Management Solutions, Inc. "Risks are being driven by a more complex set of factors." Mr. Hutton feels safer flying than driving, but the airport he uses, in San Francisco, "handles dramatically more flights than it used to, so the risk there increases exponentially."
"Go back to the butterfly that can cause a hurricane," he said. "When you see the linkages between something happening in Indonesia, a country most people can't find on a map, and its impact on the world economy, when you can make those connections and see the number of things that could cause a world financial crisis, you see more risk.
"We expect our borders to provide safety, and they don't anymore," he said. "When you and I were growing up people had faith in the Government, and that allowed them to be comfortable. That faith has been disturbed. Both the perception of risk and the risk itself have changed as people see they have linkages to parts of the world they didn't think affected them."
Readjusting people's sense of risk without scaring them senseless is itself a risky business. When Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, warned of "irrational exuberance" awhile ago, he was saying that Americans were underestimating their risks, and that the boom (or the bubble) of the 90's was feeding American culture with the notion that things would always rise and never fall -- a dangerous idea, since markets, like planes, do crash, and sometimes for similar reasons, like a loose bolt somewhere in the big machine.
 
Reality Check
This may unsettle those who dreamed of a risk-free world. "How can people assess their tolerance for risk when they've never had a loss?" Ms. Gurney said. "People have grown up in a society where they have never experienced terror, never lived through a war, never gone through a depression. Some have made fortunes overnight. They began to believe in magic."
In days gone by, people turned to leaders in times of risk. "Can you name a world leader who is strong today?" Ms. Gurney said. "Someone we can count on? Someone we can trust? We have no one we can look toward."
Another risk miscalculated: A President averse to taking chances in the public realm risked his political life for seconds of private pleasure, and so lost power to soothe people who may have reason to be scared.

DRUGS
Medicine for the Market
 
While the broad market slid, drug companies' shares climbed after the F.D.A. recommended approval of taxmoxifen as a means to reduce the risk of breast cancer. Zeneca Group P.L.C., which makes the drug, and Barr Laboratories, which sells its generic form, rose sharply. But Zeneca A.D.R.'s ended the week down $1.25 at $37.0625. Barr shares faired better, gaining $4.9375, to close at $33.3125. Barr also benefited from F.D.A. approval of its "morning-after" Preven Emergency Contraceptive Kit. Genentech rose, but fell back, ending the week off 25 cents at $68.75 after the F.D.A. approved its Herceptin biological drug to treat metastatic breast cancer. 

PILOTS' STRIKE
Clinton Rebuffs Plea
As the pilots' strike against Northwest Airlines snarled holiday travel plans in the Midwest, President Clinton rejected a call on Thursday by Gov. Arne Carlson of Minnesota to order the pilots back to work. The White House called on the two sides to return to the bargaining table, and they were to have met yesterday in Chicago with a Federal mediator. The pilots, who are demanding increased job security and higher pay to make up for cuts they took in 1993 to save the airline from bankruptcy, turned down the carrier's initial offer. Northwest says it cannot afford to meet the pilots' demands and has laid off more than half its 51,000 workers, saying that it could not afford to pay them while it was not operating.
 
SALES
Gains for Retailers
American retailers had fairly strong sales for August, with same-store sales -- those for stores open at least a year -- up 3.5 percent, according to the Goldman Sachs retail composite index. Wal-Mart's gain was 7.6 percent. In New York, retailers were counting on a strong September, as tax-free shopping kicked off back-to-school sales. Justin Cotto, 6, left, strains as his father, Norty Cotto, buttoned up a school uniform shirt at Lazarus for Kids on West 125th Street. . . . General Motors, still struggling from July strikes, reported that car and light-truck sales fell 36.4 percent in August, giving the industry as a whole a decrease of 6.6 percent, despite an increase in American sales for nearly all other auto companies. Ford was up 8.1 percent; Chrysler, 3.5 percent, and Toyota, 10.9 percent. American sales of Daimler-Benz's Mercedes cars surged 75.8 percent.
 
THE ECONOMY
Flashing Mixed Signals
Unemployment, as expected, held steady at a low 4.5 percent last month. . . . The industrial economy continued to show vigor in July, with new factory orders flowing in at the strongest pace in eight months, growing 1.2 percent, to a seasonally adjusted $335.2 billion. . . . Sales of new homes, however, fell 1.6 percent in July, to 886,000 units at an annual rate, which was more than expected. . . . Growth in workers' productivity posted the smallest gain in nearly two years in the last quarter -- 0.1 percent, though that was better than a preliminary estimate of a drop of 0.2 percent.
 
RUSSIA
Losses and More Losses
President Clinton, meeting with President Boris N. Yeltsin in Moscow, delivered a sober lecture to Russian leaders and the Russian people about the hard realities of capitalism and the price of international support for relief from Russia's financial mess. The crisis has closed banks, left millions of workers unpaid and caused the collapse of the Government. He signaled, however, that the West would step up its aid if the Kremlin pressed ahead with tough economic changes. Western banks and investment funds, particularly German institutions, that bet on Russia disclosed losses that totaled in the billions of dollars. Among those reporting sizable losses were Citicorp, Bankers Trust, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Barclays and Nomura Securities.
 
THE WORLD
The Malaise Spreads
The Finance Minister of Mexico, Jose Angel Gurria, who runs a vigorously growing economy with surging exports and thousands of new jobs being added daily, lamented how the Asian and Russian economic crises have battered stock prices in Latin America. "It has nothing to do with Mexico," he said of the outside problems. "There is a lack of differentiation" among traders. Asia's troubles were seen anew in South Korea, where nonperforming bank loans surged 11.8 percent between March and June to $21.4 billion, and riot policemen were called in to quell strikers. Above, a worker's family tries to block the officers' way at Mando Machinery in Asan. In Malaysia, the Finance Minister, Anway Ibrahim, was dismissed after the Government imposed currency controls.
 
COMPANIES
Bell Atlantic Buyouts
Bell Atlantic, only weeks after agreeing to a new contract with its unionized workers, extended a voluntary buyout offer to some of its management employees. . . . Royal Dutch/Shell and Texaco agreed to combine their European refining and marketing businesses, a step toward cutting costs and capacity. . . . Union Pacific, still recovering from some of the worst congestion in railway history, announced a plan to improve and, in some cases, ration its service. . . . Delta Air Lines, after failing to reach an agreement with its pilots, dropped plans to link its routes with United Airlines. The plan had been the cornerstone of a marketing partnership announced in April.
 
PEOPLE
The Show Goes On
Livent Inc. named Todd Haimes, the artistic director of the Roundabout Theater Company, as its artistic director, supplanting Garth H. Drabinsky, Livent's co-founder and the producer of "Ragtime" and several other lavish Broadway musicals. Livent's new managers, led by Michael Ovitz, suspended Mr. Drabinsky and a vice president last month, citing accounting irregularities. . . . After a series of weekend meetings in which Boeing directors, in the words of Philip M. Condit, the chairman, concluded that there had to be "significant changes in the composition of the management team," Ronald B. Woodard, 55, quit as president of the company's jetliner business.
 
THE S.E.C.
Auditing the Auditors?
The Securities and Exchange Commission, concerned about millions of dollars of consulting work that branches of Big Five accounting firms now do for companies that are audited by the same firm, wants the auditors to meet annually with company directors to explain why their independence has not been compromised. After recent disclosures of accounting irregularities at a dozen public companies like Cendant, Sunbeam and Livent, Lynn Turner, the S.E.C.'s chief accountant, told the 15-month-old Independence Standards Board that its current requirement -- a letter attesting to independence -- was not tough enough.

HEADLINE: First Step for Social Security

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska says Americans should be allowed to invest some Social Security contributions on their own because the average monthly benefit, $744, is "not enough to give most retirees the standard of living for which we should hope" (Letters, Aug. 9). 
 The way to start bolstering benefits is to extend the 6.2 percent FICA tax to all income above the present ceiling of $68,400. After all, high-income households are capturing most of the real income gains the economy has generated in the last two decades.

HEADLINE: Resentment Still Aimed At Chinese In Indonesia

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia

 BODY:
More than three months after huge riots swept the city, the back lanes of Glodok, Jakarta's Chinatown, are still strewn with ash and bricks and bits of broken glass. Multi-story department stores are fire-blackened shells; small shops are rubble.
On an alleyway near a Buddhist temple, old men drink coffee and look over their shoulders when they talk. 
 "We are always the scapegoats," said a 50-year-old ethnic Chinese shopkeeper who lost his shop during the three days of rioting in May, the week before President Suharto stepped down. "People tell us to leave, but we have nowhere to go. We are Indonesian, but people here don't recognize us as Indonesian. So we have no country, no home and no guarantee of our future."
The shopkeeper, who said he was afraid to give his name to a reporter, said he had seen the anonymous pamphlets that have been circulating lately, warning of further attacks. He said he had also seen the small painted circles and triangles that have appeared on Chinese-owned shops and homes, ostensibly marking them for arson or looting. "They are just trying to sow terror," he said.
But he said he was too poor to join the exodus of tens of thousands of ethnic Chinese who have fled the country, in several waves of panic, as rumors of new riots have swept Jakarta and other cities like Semarang, Surabaya and Solo.
Although the shopkeeper and others like him lack the means or connections to leave the country, many more prosperous members of the ethnic minority have found haven overseas.
At the same time, the country's wealthier Chinese, who control many of its big businesses, are said to have transferred billions of dollars of cash abroad, dealing a severe blow to Indonesia's prospects for economic recovery.
Though they make up little more than 3 percent of Indonesia's population of more than 200 million, ethnic Chinese are the nation's trading class, from shopkeepers to billionaire managers of multinational conglomerates, and they control as much as 70 percent of the Indonesia's private economy. They are also among the country's young and well-educated professionals, own many of its factories and form the backbone of the distribution network for food and other commodities.
In addition, an angry backlash among overseas Chinese in other Asian countries could do long-term damage if this economically powerful group decides to take its business elsewhere. In one of the most concerted political actions this loose-knit international community has ever taken in recent years, ethnic Chinese have staged protests in Hong Kong, Taiwan, the Philippines and the United States, as well as in China itself.
Their anger has been inflamed by reports that organized groups of rioters engaged not only in the burning and looting of Chinese-owned shops but in the systematic humiliation and rape of ethnic Chinese women.
"Indonesia: rapist capital of the world," read a banner at a recent demonstration in the Philippines. In China, the official People's Daily said in a commentary, "These criminal acts have sparked grave concern and strong indignation among the people in China and the overseas Chinese community."
Human rights groups and women's shelters here in the capital, Jakarta, have reported that more than 160 women and girls were raped in the rioting last May. They say 20 of these women died as the result of the assaults, some by suicide.
But their reports have been undermined by a failure to bring forward any victim who could give a first-hand account, by what now appear to be slipshod methods of collecting data, and by what may have been a disinformation campaign in the distribution of horrifying but inauthentic photographs of purported victims. Women's advocates say these pictures, distributed over the Internet, could be part of a campaign by people trying to increase the fears of ethnic Chinese.
Although human rights investigators stand by their accounts, saying the victims are too traumatized to talk publicly, these lapses have opened room for doubt.
Women's Affairs Minister Tutty Alawiah, one of the leaders of a Government investigation into the reported rapes, said, "The team has been conducting an investigation for one-and-a-half months now but has found no woman who fell victim to gang rape or who claimed to have been raped during the May riots."
And Gen. Wiranto, the chief of the armed forces, dismissed the reports as "simply a rumor that did not have strong supporting evidence."
The unemployed shopkeeper in Glodok, sipping his glass of coffee, said he had also heard of the rapes but did not know anyone who had been involved.

HEADLINE: Miami Succumbs to Cuban Serenade

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: MIAMI BEACH, Sept. 5

 BODY:
At a recent nightclub concert before a word-of-mouth audience of fewer than 200 people, the Cuban singer-songwriter Carlos Varela surveyed the room from the stage and said, "This looks like a concert in Havana."
But between the standing ovations, the shouted requests for songs and the tears, it was obvious on which side of the Florida Straits he found himself. "I came in '80!" one woman yelled. "I came in '98!" a man piped in. "I was born here!" another man said. 
 For Mr. Varela, who sings of present-day Cuba, warts and all, playing Miami meant the first few baby steps into a market virtually closed to him because he lives in Cuba. In cultural exchanges allowed in recent years under the American economic embargo of the island, Cuba-based artists have toured all over the United States, but they have generally skipped Miami, where many Cuban-Americans shun them as envoys of the Cuban Government and take offense at their presence in exile territory.
But last week, performers from Cuba took Miami by storm. Mr. Varela put on his show here before leaving this week for appearances in Chicago and Madison, Wis., while a powerhouse group of Cuban musicians, including the virtuoso pianist Chucho Valdes and his group Irakere, headlined the annual music industry conference known as Midem Latin America and Caribbean Music Market.
"You're giving me the happiest moment of my life," Francisco Repilado, a 91-year-old traditional guitarist who is featured on the 1998 Grammy-winning album "Buena Vista Social Club" and who is better-known as Compay Segundo, told his audience at the conference. "I've traveled throughout Europe: London, Madrid, Switzerland, Germany. And why not here?"
Many outside South Florida may ask the same question, wondering how people who promote the cause of democracy in Cuba can turn around and censor artists from the island. Only two years ago, protesters hurled insults and spat at those attending a concert by a Cuban jazz pianist, Gonzalo Rubalcaba, who did not even live on the island but had not publicly repudiated its government.
A few months later, a Little Havana restaurant planning to showcase a Cuban actress-singer, Rosita Fornes, was firebombed. And last year, Midem failed in its effort to showcase Cuban artists because of an ordinance that prohibits Miami-Dade County from doing business with Cuba or anyone who does business with Cuba. (This year, the problem was solved when the fund-raising to coordinate the music conference locally became strictly a private effort.)
A more auspicious climate has greeted Cuban performers this year. Isaac Delgado, a salsa singer; Vocal Sampling, an a cappella group; Gema 4, another a cappella group; the band La Charanga Habanera and Mr. Varela, who first performed here last March, have played here at different times with no major incidents. Longtime residents speculate that a confluence of factors may be at work, including the impact of the death last November of Jorge Mas Canosa, the most powerful exile leader advocating a hard line toward Cuba, and Pope John Paul II's call for reconciliation in his visit to Cuba in January.
But a look at the audiences that come to see the Cubans offers the best explanation: generally black Cuban-Americans turn out for Mr. Delgado; Cuban, Latin American and young for Mr. Varela; a mixed bag of music lovers for Mr. Valdes. It is a sample of changing demographics, and generations, in Hispanic Miami, which by now includes the tens of thousands of Cubans who migrated over the last two decades and grew up with much of the music that has been banned in this corner of the United States.
"They know the artists, they know the songs, they know the words," said Maria Romeu, whose marketing company, Luna Media, has promoted and co-produced several of the concerts. "Miami has a new portion of the population that hears that music and it is infectious."
But new and old Miami still coexist, and the appearance of an artist from Cuba sets off contrasting raw emotions. On the evening of Compay Segundo's performance at the Miami Beach Convention Center last week, a group of about 400 demonstrators waved little Cuban flags, chanted "Liberty! Liberty!" and held up signs that read: "Castro's rats" and "Stop using Uncle Sam's money to promote your Cuban hell." The group included former political prisoners in Cuba, Cuban-American musicians and older exiles for whom culture equates with politics if Fidel Castro's Government is involved.
"This intransigence of ours is a just intransigence," said Miriam Sifontes, 51, a medical clinic owner. "Castro is an assassin."
Inside the convention hall, meanwhile, the scene was almost reverential. Interspersed among Midem's international delegates were Cuban-Americans, including one man who sat with a cellular phone perched on his shoulder. He said his grandfather in New York was listening.
Mr. Varela's concert at Starfish nightclub here three nights later was even more jarring. Some women cried openly during some songs, and two men left the room at one point, overcome by emotion. Mr. Varela, 35, who played accompanied only by acoustic guitar, is often described by music critics as the voice of Cuba's disgruntled youth, a writer in the tradition of Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen who writes verses like "Freedom only exists when it belongs to no one" and "What are windmills for, if there are no Quixotes left?"
"He gets as real as anyone gets to describe Cuba," said Carlos Betancourt, a 32-year-old Cuban-American painter who visited Cuba for the first time this year out of curiosity. "It was a very sad concert and that's my definition of Cuba: a very sad country."
Mr. Varela's inspiration is not criticism, however, but "the Cuban's illusion of transforming things," he said in an interview.
Although he tours internationally and plays concert halls in Havana, Cuba has banned some of his music from the radio. So has Miami, as it does with other Cuba-based artists.
Mr. Varela said he had received nothing but love and respect in Miami and that his shows here had been unusually intense because the public "wants to condense all their longings in a two-hour concert." But noting the commercial radio ban of his music, and the fact that he and other Cuban performers so far have mostly played concerts for select audiences or in small venues with little advance publicity, Mr. Varela said he hoped for the day he could "fill stadiums and sell records."
"Let's make no mistake," said Mr. Varela, always the realist, "I have not sung in Miami."

HEADLINE: King Hussein's Illness Shifts Spotlight to Prince

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: KERAK, Jordan

 BODY:
King Hussein has reigned for 45 years, more than twice as long as Ahmed Thneibat has been alive. But now the King is undergoing cancer treatment for the second time in six years, and Mr. Thneibat and other Jordanians are apprehensive about what is to come.
"Rest assured, I am not over and done with yet," the King, who is 62, said in a televised address to his people from the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota in July. But he also left the impression that he is determined to prepare the country for the prospect that he might not return, saying in the same speech, "There is life and there is an end to life, and that is the way with everyone." 
 Few in Jordan doubt that power would pass to Crown Prince Hassan, the King's younger brother and closest adviser, who has been the designated heir to the throne for more than three decades. He has been Regent in the King's absence, which is expected to last until at least November.
But many Jordanians and foreign observers say they wonder whether a King Hassan could prove as successful as King Hussein in guiding Jordan through the kinds of storms that have been a main feature of the country's recent history.
"People are worried; they think there could be trouble," said Mr. Thneibat, 18, who like all but a minority in this close-knit country of 4 million has known no King but Hussein, who took power in 1953 at age 17.
Kerak, a southern city crowned by a Crusader fortress, has long been a base of support for Jordan's monarchy. But riots broke out here two years ago over an increase in the price of bread, a reminder that loyalty has limits. Now the public mood is again turning volatile, a result of a crippling water crisis, severe economic problems and rising disillusionment over peace with Israel.
Over tea and hummus in a simple cafe adorned with black-and-white portraits of the country's current and former Kings, Mr. Thneibat spoke for many in saying he hoped that a King Hassan might prove more vigorous than his brother in addressing the economy. But as he and other Jordanians try to conceive of a new era, a bigger question may be whether a King Hassan would inherit his brother's capacity to chart his own course, even when it means forging ahead of public opinion.
"It's a minefield, and he doesn't have what it takes to cross it safely," Labib Kamhawi, a prominent human rights campaigner, said, spelling out one view. "He doesn't have the charisma the King had. He doesn't have the broad base of support. And he would take power at a time when the power of the Hashemite dynasty is at a very low ebb."
People close to Prince Hassan say that he shares King Hussein's deep commitment to Jordan's peace with Israel, though it has borne little fruit and has little domestic support. That assessment is shared by most foreign analysts, who say they are confident that the departure of King Hussein would not cause Jordan to back away from promoting a broader settlement of Arab-Israeli disputes.
But diplomats do say that Hassan, as King, may have less latitude to promote the peace than his brother, in part because hostility toward Israel has deepened among Jordanians, and in part because the Crown Prince has rarely displayed his brother's magnanimous style.
"There's still a great deal of uncertainty about the Crown Prince," a Western diplomat said. "He's not his brother. He doesn't have a common touch, and he gets his information from briefing papers whereas the King gets his information from the people."
The Prince has declined interview requests during the King's illness and has played the role of caretaker, not addressing the doubts about him. But in what may have been an attempt to defuse some criticism, he did convene an unusual meeting in late August that included leaders from all of Jordan's political parties, including Islamists who form the main opposition bloc.
The prospect of a Jordanian leader with untested domestic prestige is particularly worrying to Israelis, who are nervous about Yasir Arafat's pledge to declare an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip next May, when the Middle East peace plan begun by the Oslo accords is supposed to be completed.
At 51, Prince Hassan is nearly 12 years younger than the King, who will turn 63 on Nov. 14. Hassan was 6 when Hussein took power on May 2, 1953, succeeding his grandfather, King Abdullah -- who had been assassinated in Jerusalem in 1951 as Hussein stood at his side -- and his father, King Talal, who stepped down in favor of his son after less than a year in power.
Since his 18th birthday in 1965, Prince Hassan has been the country's designated No. 2, and he is described in an official biography as having "constantly served as King Hussein's closest political adviser, deputy and confidant, as well as Regent in his absence." He earned a degree in Oriental studies from Christ Church College, Oxford University, and has worked tirelessly within Jordan to promote scientific study and better integration of the region's economy. He took part in the negotiations that led to Jordan's peace agreement with Israel, met with Benjamin Netanyahu even before Mr. Netanyahu was elected Israel's Prime Minister, and has close ties to most Arab leaders.
Still, he has always seemed in many ways the King's alter ego, more comfortable in a tie and blue blazer than an Arab headdress, and more disposed toward academic-style oratory than toward the emotional eloquence of his older brother.
Some of his admirers say that he could not have been expected to show more color as Crown Prince; his mission, they say, has been to stay in the background. "He's been in the shadow of a very important historic figure, so it will be prudent to judge him only after he takes center stage," said Mustafa Hamarneh, director of the Center for Strategic Studies at the University of Jordan.
But in listing the qualities that have made the King such a dominant figure, most other analysts give prominence to some that are not readily transferable.
"The majority of Jordanians would side with the King even if they think he is wrong," said Fahed Fanek, an economist who is one of Jordan's most popular newspaper columnists. "Ninety percent of the population of Jordan was born after the King took power. They know that he was indispensable in leading the country to safety. So even if they think he was wrong, they give him the benefit of the doubt."
After renal cancer in 1992 and a prostate operation in 1997, the King was found to have lymphoma this summer after nearly a year in which he had been suffering from inexplicable fevers. A statement issued by the Mayo Clinic said that the disease is "highly treatable with chemotherapy," which the King began in July, but it also mentioned a need for plenty of rest.
So far the King has displayed a vigorous public face, even flying his own jet to Washington after completing the first and second of six scheduled rounds of chemotherapy. On the first of those trips, he and his wife, Queen Noor, dined privately on a White House balcony with the Clintons, and even now, two months into what is expected to be at least four months of treatment, Jordanian officials say that he consults by telephone with Prince Hassan at least once a day.
It was the King, Jordanian officials say, who assumed the leading role in orchestrating a change of Government in August, replacing a team tarred by evidence that its mismanagement was to blame for a water crisis so severe that Saudi Arabia and Syria sent emergency stocks to the rescue. And even while recuperating at his private home in Washington, he has met with the new Government, led by Fayez Tarawneh, a former Ambassador to the United States and Foreign Minister.
In the months ahead, Jordanian officials expect the country's affairs to be administered along a kind of triangle between Amman, Washington, and the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. But people familiar with the King's health say that his resistance to disease has been weakened by the chemotherapy and that it is likely to diminish further as the treatment progresses.

HEADLINE: Schools Struggle With a Dearth of Bus Drivers

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 5

 BODY:
The pay is low, the hours short and irregular and the cargo can be difficult to handle.
So consider it a small miracle when the school bus arrives -- especially this year, when tight employment is making it difficult for many school districts to find drivers. 
 Even schools with a full roster of drivers worry that the sudden absence of a few will put routes in chaos, forcing maintenance workers, mechanics and supervisors to take to the wheel, and forcing children to wait, wait, wait.
"It's a day-by-day thing to keep enough drivers," said Russell Martin, owner of Rains & Martin Inc., a school bus contractor in rural Bolivar, Mo.
No wonder there is trouble. The job generally is part time, with hours split between morning and afternoon runs. Benefits are minimal, if they exist at all. Also, school wages do not compete with what people can get elsewhere in these days of low unemployment.
As Mr. Martin describes it, a driver might work an hour and a half in the morning and the same amount in the afternoon, earning $27 to $33 a day. In addition, licensing requirements have become stricter, protecting children but creating paperwork.
Then there is the load.
"When you have a bus driver that has upwards of 60 students with their back to them and having to drive the vehicle, it gets to be a little more tedious than some people actually want to deal with," said Steve Washington, director of transportation for Hampton City Schools in Hampton, Va., where drivers are full-time employees.
To get drivers, school districts and contractors have turned to the Internet and direct mail advertising. Some are also giving raises and bonuses and treating drivers a little more kindly, the same moves that many school districts are making to try to attract teachers.
Drivers in Wake County, N.C., are getting a 30 percent increase over three years and a $300 bonus if they recruit a new driver who holds the job more than 90 days. The new hire gets a $250 bonus. Drivers are honored at monthly events and a yearly banquet.
"We just recognize them as much as we can in trying to keep them," said Wyatt Currin, interim transportation director.

HEADLINE: Shore Towns Give Summer Favorable Review

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON 

DATELINE: SEASIDE HEIGHTS, N.J., Sept. 4

 BODY:
Bobby Dee, a k a Robert DiPeso, counted out the quarters for the players at the Gift Wheel at Bobby Dee's Casino ("Nobody leaves without a TV!") on the Wildwood boardwalk and pronounced the summer of 1998 a good one.
"The weather was excellent, the water was clean, the families showed up," he said. "That equals a good summer for us." 
 Mr. DiPeso's contented appraisal found plenty of echoes up and down the region's shoreline as the last week of unofficial summer drew toward its Labor Day finale.
Sure, dramatic reporting about Hurricane Bonnie scared some visitors away toward the end of August, and rain in June kept Jones Beach in New York from matching last year's turnout. But for a part of the country that equates summer with sand and salt water, with quiet family seafood cookouts and the raucous honky-tonk of the boardwalk, the season just ending was clearly a success.
"People have disposable cash and they're roaming around looking for entertainment," said David Shotwell, senior administrator of the Ocean Grove Camp Meeting Association, the annual Christian jamboree on the Jersey Shore. "You can just tell by the number of people who don't know where the bathrooms are that we're getting a lot of new people.
"They may have stumbled in here by accident," Mr. Shotwell continued, "but we sure try to make sure they come back."
Jennie Masher and her daughter Jill were among Mr. DiPeso's contestants at the Gift Wheel -- no TV yet -- which is like a wheel of fortune game in a real casino, but stays legal by offering prizes instead of cash. Fourteen members of Mrs. Masher's extended family had come down for a week from Troy, N.Y., which is also the number of years since their last visit.
"We had been here before and wanted to come back with the kids," said Mrs. Masher, a homemaker. "It's been fun because there's a lot to do, and the kids like it."
Tourism agencies are still far from knowing the final count of hotel taxes, beach tag sales, parking lot receipts and all the other measures of the summer's financial impact.
Still, there are some fragments of early data to suggest that it was a good season: the Connecticut Office of Tourism reported that tourist stops at highway information centers were up 5.7 percent and that the $6.8 billion in hotel and motel taxes collected in June was well above last year's $4.5 million.
On the southern Jersey Shore, a collection of a similar tourism tax to build a new convention center in Wildwood was 34 percent ahead of last year's level through June.
Atlantic City's hotels topped last year's extraordinary 94 percent occupancy rate with a 97 percent filled rate through August, according to Linda Conlin, executive director of the Office of Travel and Tourism in New Jersey's Department of Commerce and Economic Development. And Ms. Conlin said an informal survey of shore businesses also produced an upbeat bottom line: "Equal to last year's good summer season, if not surpassing it," she said.
Tourism spending amounted to $25.5 billion in New Jersey last year and accounted for 623,000 jobs, according to the department. Spending totaled $14 billion on the Jersey Shore, which supported 267,000 tourism-related jobs.
Shore tourism officials said that water quality across the region was not the problem it had been several years ago, when algae blooms, pollution and medical debris washing ashore made frequent headlines. In New York, Hurricane Bonnie actually scoured an outlying sandbar and deposited more beach sand on the Fire Island shoreline, said Gerard Stoddard, president of the Fire Island Association.
Good beach weather during July and August took crowds to Long Island's South Shore as well, but summer visits to Jones Beach State Park decreased to 3.9 million this year from 4.4 million last year because of rainy weekends in June, said the superintendent, Joseph F. Lescinski.
If there was a problem, it was that Labor Day came a week after the end of August, the traditional finish line, so that many young ride operators, ticket takers and pizza waiters were gone for the final week.
"Most of our workers come from the Toms River School District, which, without any thought or consideration for the tourist industry, reopened its doors on Sept. 1," said Bill Irwin, general manager of the Casino Pier and Waterworks arcade and amusement park, which employs 700 seasonal workers in Seaside Heights. "That left us a bit short-handed."
Mr. Irwin and other natives of the Jersey Shore know that, for all the year-to-year sameness the summer seasons seem to share, a lot has changed.
The rise of the dual-career family has meant that few visitors take a house for the summer the way they used to, said Vicki Clark, director of marketing for the Cape May Chamber of Commerce, so rentals tend to be for shorter periods, and are more often made on a spur of the moment.
Some things never change, however. J. R. and Terri Bale and their two boys, from New Providence, N.J., have a three-week rental with Mrs. Bale's mother and her sister's family in Seaside Heights this summer, just the way Mrs. Bale's extended family, the Azzolinas, the Giaimos and the Valentis, shared summer rentals when she was growing up. "We always had a house when I was a kid," Mrs. Bale said. "Then we grew up into teen-agers and we didn't want to do that with everyone's parents, and it ended. But now, maybe we're starting it all over again with our own kids."
Charlie Dolan, a food broker from Kearny, bought a house with his wife, Jo-Ann, on the bay side at Chadwicks, a few miles up the barrier island from Seaside Heights, partly to give their seven grandchildren a taste of what the shore was like in the old days.
"Growing up as a kid, we'd leave the day after school ended and stay for two months," he said. "We made new friends every summer."
Out on the beach behind Mr. Dolan, Robert Gluck had reached page 239 of "Buddenbrooks," which is less than halfway through Thomas Mann's masterpiece. "A couple of days," he said, when asked how long it had taken him to get that far in his heavy seaside reading. "Three months," his wife, Cindy, corrected.
But no matter -- Mann was on his face in the sand, and Mr. Gluck was content just to be there, with the sound of the surf thumping a few hundred feet away.
"If you grew up coming to the shore, you get to a point where if you don't smell the brine and feel the sand between toes, you're missing something," said Mr. Gluck, a freelance writer. "You wait for summer to come, and then it comes, and then it goes by fast, because you're having fun."

HEADLINE: U.S. AND JAPANESE CONFER BUT DIFFER ON ECONOMIC CURES

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 5

 BODY:
The economic policy leaders of the world's two largest economies, the United States and Japan, spent hours here Friday night talking about the heightened risk of global recession and a further spread of the turmoil that has engulfed Asia, Russia and now Latin America. But they left this morning with no new plans, and an uneasy sense that Japan and the United States remain on different wavelengths about how quickly countries must act.
The discussion over dinner on Nob Hill included Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, and Kiichi Miyazawa, the former Prime Minister who reluctantly agreed to take the job of Finance Minister last month during Japan's deepest recession since the end of World War II. 
 At the dinner's end, American officials said they feared that Japan's leaders still did not accept the premise that Japan's huge banking crisis and its moribund economy were a major cause of the turmoil that included a stomach-churning dive on Wall Street this week, huge market drops and instability in Latin America and deepening chaos in Russia.
The astounding descent of the ruble, which has dropped 63 percent since Aug. 17 and has begun to lead to food shortages and tremendous inflation, led the British Government today to announce that a meeting of deputy finance ministers from the world's largest economic powers, the Group of 7, was planned in London, probably in the coming week, to map out a new Russia strategy.
But in a sign of the growing split between Tokyo and Washington, Japanese officials bristled at the mounting American pressure and suggested that they were being made scapegoats for problems that are unrelated to Tokyo's seven years of economic mismanagement.
"How can Japan's recession be responsible for an economic malaise in Latin America or Russia?" asked a senior Japanese official, who insisted on anonymity. "Japan has been overly criticized. My concern is that if anything happens to the U.S. economy, everyone will point to Japan and say it is responsible."
The meeting took place as Mr. Rubin and Mr. Greenspan, who in ordinary times often outdo each other at understatement, issued warnings that the world economy is in a particularly fragile state.
Only hours before the dinner, Mr. Greenspan, in a speech at the University of California at Berkeley, cautioned that "it is just not credible that the United States can remain an oasis of prosperity unaffected by a world that is experiencing greatly increased stress." He appeared to open the door to the possibility that the Federal Reserve might consider a cut in interest rates if more evidence arose that downturns on three continents were beginning to stall the American economy.
Mr. Rubin, in a conversation as he flew from Washington to his meeting here, said that "these are clearly extremely difficult times in the world economy and world financial markets."
"This is an unprecedented situation in a host of respects," said the Treasury Secretary, who experienced several major market drops in his 26 years on Wall Street as a trader and then co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs, the investment banking firm. "The number of countries experiencing difficulties at once is something we have not seen before."
The speed at which hundreds of billions of dollars that flowed into emerging economies in the 1990's have flowed out was also unprecedented. The inflow occurred, Mr. Rubin said, because "investors got progressively less rigorous about risk."
Now they see risk everywhere, Mr. Rubin and other Treasury officials note, and they rarely discriminate between countries with deep problems and countries that are simply fighting off economic contagion. A global credit crunch has resulted, with countries that lived off of huge flows of international investment now unable to obtain it at any price.
"We are in a situation which is indeed a dangerous one, by far not fully rational," said Michel Camdessus, the managing director of the embattled International Monetary Fund, which has been charged by its many critics with exacerbating the crisis it stepped in to abate.
Mr. Camdessus, speaking in Washington at the conclusion of a meeting of Latin American finance ministers who had come to plead for relief, said: "The degree of panic going on -- this is, indeed, clearly exacting an excessive and unfair pressure on a large number of countries."
For Mr. Camdessus, that is a significant change of tone. In January, he signed an agreement in Indonesia with President Suharto that he declared would restore confidence -- and saw the country dissolve into violence, economic chaos and political upheaval that forced Mr. Suharto's resignation. Early this summer he declared that there was no crisis in Russia, and a huge one erupted within weeks.
"The whole tone has changed, for everyone," said Jeffrey Garten, the dean of the Yale School of Management, a former top official in the Commerce Department. "A few months ago people were talking about seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. Now the only hope is keeping the world economy from total deterioration. And you get a sense that this is all now truly left to Adam Smith's invisible hand -- it's beyond any country's ability, any institution's ability, to control."
For their part, Mr. Rubin and Mr. Greenspan, speaking frequently by phone and at their weekly breakfast meetings in Washington, are choosing their words with extraordinary care. Neither, for example, has used the phrase "global recession" in public. They fear that the phrase alone might cause more selloffs and make continued turmoil a self-fulfilling prophecy. But Mr. Miyazawa, speaking in Japanese at a news conference here Friday evening, used a close equivalent to the term. And at one point he broke into English to discuss how the failure of a major Japanese bank, the Long Term Credit Bank of Japan, "might result in systemic risk for the United States and for Japan."
"Systemic risk" is the phrase used by monetary authorities to describe how the failure of an institution or a severe market drop in one economy can course through the global economy, setting off a cycle of events elsewhere.
For Mr. Miyazawa, 78, the return to San Francisco to plead for "more patience" to deal with Japan's problems had odd historical echoes. In 1951, as a young, English-speaking bureaucrat, Mr. Miyazawa was a central behind-the-scenes player in the negotiation of the peace treaty between Japan and the United States -- signed here -- that ended the American occupation of his country and set it on the path to become an economic superpower. In the ensuing half-century, Japan has often turned to Mr. Miyazawa, whose contacts in Washington run deep, to deal with what the Japanese call "gaiatsu," or foreign pressure. He grew up in the Japanese Finance Ministry, and assured his dinner partners on Friday night -- in the presence of the ministry's officials -- that he could deal with powerful bureaucratic resistance to reform of Japan's economic system.
But he was less sanguine about his ability to get Japan's Parliament to act quickly on financial rescue legislation. The key dispute is whether to allow a huge infusion of taxpayer money to the banking system to rid it of bad loans.
Mr. Rubin left little doubt about his position on that question. He called for the "aggessive and timely use of public funds" to stabilize the banking system, and he said at a news conference that "everywhere I go, Japan is at the center of discussions" about how to get the world economy back on track.

Clinton Urges Confidence
 WASHINGTON, Sept. 5 (Reuters) -- President Clinton sought to calm American economic jitters today, saying the American economy was moving in a positive direction despite global financial turmoil that has pummeled stocks.
"For all the quicksilver volatility in the world's financial markets, the American economy is on the right track," Mr. Clinton said in his weekly radio address.
He added, however, that the United States was affected by overseas financial events and that it was crucial for Congress to help promote stability by approving funding for the International Monetary Fund.
Mr. Clinton also urged Congress to maintain fiscal discipline and reserve any budget surpluses pending reform of the Social Security retirement system, and said he would work to win passage of education measures that would assure long-term prosperity.

Looks Like a Bus, Acts Like a Subway

BYLINE: By ALISON GARDY 

 BODY:
A bus system as speedy as a subway? It exists in the city of Curitiba in southern Brazil, which depends on a futuristic bus system to transport more than half its 2.3 million inhabitants every day.
Features include a two-way bus lane down the middle of major traffic arteries and a specially designed bus shelter resembling a horizontal cylinder on a raised platform. The shelter is accessible to handicapped riders and provides complete protection from bad weather. 
 Passengers pay their fares upon entering the cylinder. When a bus pulls up, the driver aligns sliding doors on the side with those on the side of the cylinder. When the doors open, people exit and enter the bus with the speed and efficiency of subway riders.
Residents of Curitiba, 310 miles south of Sao Paulo, seem to like their bus system. Even though they had the second-highest car ownership rate in Brazil in the early 90's, with one in three owning a car, the use of gasoline was 30 percent lower than in eight comparable Brazilian cities, and air pollution levels were among the lowest in Brazil, according to a study by an urban development adviser for the United Nations Development Program.
A bus that moves with the speed of a subway would seem like a boon in New York, where fast is never fast enough. A city bus, with steps to climb, fares to pay on board and slower-moving pneumatic doors, stops at curbside for an average of seven seconds per passenger, compared with a city subway, which stops at platforms an average of one second per passenger.
So why not a Curitiba-style bus system for New York? The Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the city's Department of Transportation ran a five-week experiment using a similar system in downtown Manhattan from April to May 1992, along a route that connected the World Trade Center, Staten Island Ferry, South Street Seaport and City Hall. The trial revealed that the Curitiba bus model might be more appropriate for the fringes of New York.
As Larry Gould, director of operations analysis at New York City Transit, explained, "Most people use the subway for the long haul and use the buses to connect to the subways." So the Curitiba model would work better for New Yorkers in densely populated, far-flung areas like Co-op City in the Bronx and Starrett City in Brooklyn, which represent "the extremities of the system that don't have subways but do have heavy ridership" on buses, Mr. Gould said. He added, "I don't think it is applicable to Manhattan streets, where you have people getting on and off a lot."
Upper East Side residents along far-flung York Avenue might beg to differ. ALISON GARDY

Going Their Way, Going Your Way

BYLINE: By RICHARD WEIR 

 BODY:
For New York City taxi passengers, a ride in a cab is often a solitary experience and sometimes a pricey one. But in Madison, Wis., the Badger Cab Company offers a fairly affordable way to get to point B, along with company in the back seat.
Since its founding 52 years ago, Badger, named after the state animal, has shunned meters in lieu of a shared-ride system. A Badger passenger may share the cab with as many as four other riders, and a few packages. 
 The company's 115 drivers double as couriers, directed by dispatchers from time to time to pick up a parcel here or drop off an envelope there. This may make for a trip that's a little longer than it otherwise might need to be, but the discounted fare is worth it to some people, particularly the elderly and students like Jennie Capellaro.
"It's the economic way to go," said Ms. Capellaro, 26, a history major at the University of Wisconsin. "It is cheaper." About 40 percent cheaper than a trip on a metered cab, said Tom Royston, the operations manager of Badger, which bases its fares on a zone system. For a ride from the Dane County regional airport to the State Capitol, a distance of roughly five miles, Badger charges $7.25, compared with around $12 for a metered cab ride.
While some passengers hail Badger cabs, the typical customer calls to be picked up. The dispatcher usually assigns the fare to the nearest car. "The bottom line is that they are all going in the same general direction," Mr. Royston said. "You might zigzag six blocks one way or three blocks another, but you would not go backward or five miles out of the way."
Badger's formula of bargain fares and methodical dispatching has made it the cab of choice in Madison. A 1997 city survey found that among the three cab companies in Madison -- the other two use meters -- Badger had the most paid passengers: 890,921, compared with 526,636 and 248,704 for its competitors. It was a close second in revenues.
But could such a business work in a place as congested and time-conscious as New York City, where the Taxi and Limousine Commission estimates the average medium-distance ride in a yellow cab is 2.19 miles and costs $6.50?
Not likely, said Hal Morgan of the International Taxi Cab and Livery Association, a trade group in Kensington, Md. "Most of the time, people take cabs because they are time sensitive," he said, noting that in New York City, yellow cabs are banned from having dispatch radios, which makes carefully planned combined routes nearly impossible.
Allan Fromberg, a spokesman for the Taxi Commission said there was no single company in New York that specializes in shared rides. But the city's 35,000 radio-dispatched liveries are allowed to take passengers to multiple destinations, he said, as long the rides are prearranged. "It can be done," he said. "It really is at the discretion of the passenger and the company." RICHARD WEIR

A Summit Trip Like No Other

 BODY:
When President Clinton met with President Boris N. Yeltsin in Moscow, the near collapse of Russia's economy was on his mind, but there wasn't much to be done beyond expressions of support if Russia stayed the course of reform.
The Russians and Americans also concluded an agreement that would let American satellites give Russia dependable warnings about missile launchings around the world. The satellites were originally put up to safeguard America against Russian missile launchings. But now there is another danger: errors could be made by the deteriorating Russian early-warning system, leading to an accidental nuclear war. Thus the American backup. 
 After Russia, President Clinton proceeded to Northern Ireland, where he was greeted as a peacemaker (see box below), and the Irish Republic, where he praised the country's prosperity as a fruit of peace. He also resumed facing reporters' questions about his relationship with the former White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky.

HEADLINE: Clinton Trip Fails to Silence Doubt on His Domestic Clout

It has been a question from the start of President Clinton's five-day trip to Russia, Ireland and Northern Ireland this week: will his domestic troubles affect his ability to function abroad as the nation's leader?
The answer, from the President's aides, has been a resounding and unanimous no. 
 But others are not so certain, and a strong piece of evidence came from Moscow on Friday, when Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, the Acting Prime Minister, announced measures to try to pull Russia out of its economic tailspin.
Less than a day after Mr. Clinton left Moscow, where he delivered a series of stern lectures on fiscal and monetary responsibility, Mr. Chernomyrdin proposed an "economic dictatorship" that would include a huge infusion of new rubles to prop up failing banks, almost certainly a prescription for a burst of inflation and a step that Mr. Clinton specifically warned against.
To be sure, Mr. Chernomyrdin is in a tough battle for confirmation and Russia's internal politics are little influenced by outside forces. But it was clear that Russia's leaders either were not listening to Mr. Clinton's lectures or they did not fear the effects of defying him.
Other evidence came on the front pages of American newspapers all week, which were dominated by stories not of Mr. Clinton's diplomacy but of the slow progress of his penitence over his relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky.
Mr. Clinton took questions twice from reporters, during a news conference on Wednesday with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia and a Friday meeting with Prime Minister Bertie Ahern of Ireland.
Both appearances were overshadowed by questions about Ms. Lewinsky, and the coverage in the United States focused almost exclusively on the President's calibrated regrets over the affair.
Scholars say it is impossible to separate a President's domestic fortunes from his prestige abroad. Although Mr. Clinton remains popular overseas -- particularly in Ireland, where he is given credit for supporting efforts that led to the Northern Ireland peace accord this year -- leaders recognize that even without the Lewinsky scandal, Mr. Clinton is a lame duck with a little more than two years remaining in his term, if he completes it.
"It is difficult to be damaged goods at home and to be effective abroad," said Dmitri K. Simes, director of the Nixon Center research organization in Washington and a longtime foreign policy aide to Richard M. Nixon during his Presidency.
Mr. Simes said that many Russians have written Mr. Clinton off, not only because he is crippled by domestic difficulties but also because Russians perceive him as being too close to Mr. Yeltsin, who is widely reviled by his countrymen.
Mr. Clinton today lacks the moral authority to be "a lasting partner for the Russians, particularly during the post-Yeltsin era," Mr. Simes said.
Mr. Clinton's aides insisted that the President was not hampered in his ability to do his job by the low cloud of scandal hanging over him.
Michael D. McCurry, the President's press secretary, said on Friday that Mr. Clinton operated in "parallel universes" -- battling scandal at home while conducting high policy abroad -- and declared that the two did not intersect.
Asked whether Mr. Clinton's authority had been diminished by the Lewinsky matter, Mr. McCurry replied: "It clearly has not been, and I think the President takes some satisfaction in that. He dealt with world leaders on this trip and is confident that he continues to do good work in the interest of the American people as he fulfills his constitutional responsibilities."
In a less guarded moment, Mr. McCurry conceded that the Lewinsky matter had "detracted" from the main missions of the trip -- encouraging Russian leaders to stick to the course of economic reform and urging Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland to press ahead on the road to reconciliation.
But Mr. McCurry and other aides blamed the press for an unhealthy obsession with the Lewinsky matter and for drowning out the President's message. "It's all so circular," said one of Mr. Clinton's top foreign policy aides, his voice tinged with bitterness. "You ask the questions and then you write that Clinton was forced once again to deal with Lewinsky. It hasn't come up in one meeting that we've had on this trip."
But if the Lewinsky matter did not arise in meetings, neither did foreign leaders rally to the President's defense, at least not in public. Mr. McCurry assured reporters that Mr. Clinton had received many messages of encouragement from leaders around the world, but declined to identify any of them.
Neither Mr. Yeltsin nor Mr. Ahern spoke on the President's behalf as he took questions about the scandal. Nor did Tony Blair, the British Prime Minister, with whom Mr. Clinton spent the day in Northern Ireland on Thursday. Mr. Blair offered Mr. Clinton private solace and public support during a visit to Washington last January, shortly after the President's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky was first disclosed.
The trip has taken Mr. Clinton from meetings in a Moscow gripped by political and economic crisis to a meeting with families of the victims of the car bomb in Omagh, Northern Ireland, to a festive rally in the streets of Limerick this morning. Mr. Clinton's mood has shifted as dramatically as the settings: somber in Moscow, mournful in Omagh, upbeat in Limerick.
Mr. Clinton was hailed as a peacemaker in his appearances in Northern Ireland and Ireland the last three days, and he clearly reveled in the warmth of his reception here.
Everywhere his message to the Irish was the same: though terror will surely return, the will to peace will overcome those who seek to destroy it.
Looking out over a sea of waving American and Irish flags among the crowd packed into downtown Limerick this morning, Mr. Clinton said, "As we mourn the losses in Omagh and the three little boys who were killed and taken from their parents' arms, remember there will still be efforts by the enemies of peace to break your will, to get you to turn back, to get you to lose faith."
"Don't do it," the President implored the enthusiastic throng of thousands. "Don't do it. This is you at your best. Do not let them break your will."
Mr. Clinton spent the afternoon pursuing the real reason he came to southwest Ireland today, playing golf at the historic course at Ballybunion.

HEADLINE: Amory Bradford, 85, Times General Manager

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN 

 BODY:
Amory H. Bradford, a former vice president and general manager of The New York Times who was the chief negotiator for the Publishers Association in the bruising 114-day New York newspaper strike in 1962-63, died Friday at his home in Edisto Beach, S.C. He was 85.
A Yale-educated Wall Street lawyer, Mr. Bradford joined The Times in 1947 as a special assistant to the publisher, Arthur Hays Sulzberger, and over the next 16 years became a company director, The Times's business and general manager and an important member of management. 
 Long before satellites and computers, former associates recalled Friday, Mr. Bradford had visions of The Times as an economically strong newspaper of global influence, with editions in Paris for European consumption and on the West Coast for what was to be the start of a nationwide readership.
Allying himself with Orvil E. Dryfoos, Mr. Sulzberger's son-in-law, who became publisher in 1961, Mr. Bradford engineered the company's purchase of the Gaspesia Pulp and Paper Company in Canada to insure newsprint supplies. He also saw cost-saving automation as the economic wave of the future, and he regarded unions, inefficiency and low productivity as roadblocks.
By the early 1960's, he had become chairman of the New York City Publishers Association, made up of the city's eight major newspapers, and was president of the New York Regional Plan Association. He had also launched The Times's short-lived International edition, had formulated plans for its West Coast edition, and appeared to have positioned himself for The Times's presidency.
But his personal and professional ambitions finally hit a rock.
On Dec. 8, 1962, the printers' union launched what was to be the longest and costliest strike in New York newspaper history, a 114-day marathon. The Publishers Association chose Mr. Bradford as its point man in negotiations with Typographical Union No. 6 and its president, Bertram A. Powers.
They were natural enemies from the start. Mr. Powers, a high school dropout, was a tough, relentless negotiator, the embodiment of a gut-fighter up from the streets. Mr. Bradford, an Ivy League aristocrat, impeccably dressed and 6 feet 4 inches tall, was accustomed to snapping orders at pliant subordinates.
As the strike dragged on, it became clear to insiders that the clash of two personalities was prolonging the dispute; the publishers began to have doubts about Mr. Bradford.
When the walkout ended on April 1, 1963, The Times published a two-page account by A. H. Raskin, its labor reporter. Only a few paragraphs were devoted to Mr. Bradford, but they were damaging. In his memoirs, "My Life and The Times," Turner Catledge, for many years The Times's chief news executive, said Mr. Bradford had gone to him and to Mr. Dryfoos to try to get the article suppressed. "He made it clear he did not want the story published, or least those portions about him," Mr. Catledge related. But the article was published.
After calling Mr. Bradford "handsome, articulate and aloof," Mr. Raskin wrote: "One top-level mediator said Mr. Bradford brought an attitude of such icy disdain into the conference rooms that the mediator often felt he ought to ask the hotel to send up more heat. Another mediator, who called Mr. Bradford the possessor of the keenest mind on the management side, said he operates on a 'short fuse.' " The publishers admired his "independence and assurance," but "they are occasionally galled by his imperiousness," Mr. Raskin added.
Two months later, Mr. Dryfoos died, and Mr. Bradford's hopes for the presidency faded. On June 20, 1963, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger was named president and publisher of The Times, and Mr. Bradford issued a statement saying he was "not in agreement with the proposed plan of reorganization," and resigned.
Amory Howe Bradford was born in Springfield, Mass., on Oct. 1, 1912, the son of a Congregational minister, and grew up in Rutland, Vt., and Providence, R.I. He graduated from Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., in 1930, Yale in 1934 and Yale Law School in 1937. He practiced law with Davis, Polk Wardwell & Reed in New York for a decade, except for Army intelligence service in World War II.
After leaving The Times in 1963, he was a consultant to the Ford Foundation for programs in Greece, Turkey, Switzerland and Italy, and, in 1964, he became an executive with Scripps-Howard Newspapers.
In 1965, he was appointed by the Commerce Department to set up a $23 million program that created 3,000 jobs in Oakland, Calif., a city of hard-core unemployment. Drawing on the experience, he wrote a novel, "Oakland's Not For Burning" (David McKay, 1968).
In 1970, Mr. Bradford headed a Nixon Administration study group that designed and recommended the new Federal Environmental Protection Agency substantially in the form that was accepted by the President and Congress. He later called it his most satisfying accomplishment.
In later years, Mr. Bradford acknowledged having become a jobless alcoholic, and confided to friends that he once came close to suicide. But he began psychiatric treatment, quit drinking and radically changed his life style. He began studying massage and psychotherapy at the Esalen Institute in Big Sur, Calif.
Harrison E. Salisbury, a Pulitzer Prize-winning foreign correspondent for The Times, wrote in a 1980 book about The Times, "Without Fear or Favor," that Mr. Bradford had become "a sort of guru," and said: "The last time he attended a reunion in the Thousand Islands with his fellow Yale Skull and Crossbones members one remembered Amory lounging in the nude while they sat on the beach in their trunks. In fact, he went nude for most of the day."
From 1978 to 1982, Mr. Bradford lived in a van, traveling in the United States, Canada and Mexico, occasionally revisiting Esalen. He practiced gestalt therapy in Arlington, Vt., from 1982 to 1987. He and his wife, Laurene, also taught massage.
In recent years, he had been writing his memoirs. In a statement he composed for his own obituary, he said that his "final years were intensified by the practice of Siddha Yoga meditation, taught by Swami Muktananda, to whom he was introduced by his daughter Madhavi in 1976."
Besides his wife, Mr. Bradford is survived by three daughters, Carola Lea, of Lyme, N.H., Madhavi Bradford, of Carbondale, Colo., and Deborah Bradford, of Aspen, Colo.; two sons, Peter, of Peru, Vt., and David, of Brattleboro, Vt.; his first wife and the mother of his five children, Carol Noyes, of Syosset, N.Y.; a sister, Jean Page, of Concord, N.H.; a brother, J. Allyn Bradford, of Cambridge, Mass.; two stepdaughters, Rebecca Waggoner, of Walnut Creek, Calif., and Kate Dow, of Rutland, Vt., and eight grandchildren.

HEADLINE: END OF A GHETTO: A special report.;
Razing the Slums to Rescue the Residents

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Sept. 5

 BODY:
In the final months of the Hole, anarchy was everywhere. The Hole, the most oppressive section of Chicago's notorious Robert Taylor Homes housing project, was coming down.
Gang members shot at a moving van outside one of the Hole's three high-rise buildings. Moving crews tried to hurry out each day before drug dealers commandeered the elevators. 
 Lenzie Jones packed his grandchildren's clothes for the movers but did not know what to do with their mother's belongings. She had fled a few days before, after the drug gang she hawked heroin for accused her of stealing and beat her with a baseball bat and a two-by-four.
Angela Smith frantically swatted cockroaches and attacked stains in her kitchen. An inspector from the building she wanted to move into was coming to scrutinize her housekeeping. If she failed, she would lose the apartment she had set her heart on.
Katie Sistrunk, who at 45 had reared 13 children in the Hole, had no idea where she would go, days before her building was to be emptied. Juanita Williams, 74, was so paralyzed over leaving her apartment of 25 years that she stayed after the water and gas were shut off, until police officers removed her.
On a scale not seen in decades, the Federal Government is helping cities clear slums again, but this time they are slums it helped create: public housing projects crippled by flawed policies and mismanagement and overwhelmed by poverty and crime.
From Hartford and Newark to Denver and San Francisco, 100,000 apartments in the nation's worst public housing projects are being razed under a Federal program called Hope VI. The plan is to replace them with smaller developments that mix families of different incomes, while moving thousands of tenants into privately owned buildings.
In Chicago, where high-rise housing projects are corrosive landmarks of poverty and racial segregation, the demolition will be nothing less than seismic: the city wants to raze 11,000 apartments, nearly 40 percent of its public housing for families, over the next 15 years.
And in a city whose housing projects contain 11 of the nation's 15 poorest census tracts, and where buildings in five large projects are being demolished, nowhere is the challenge greater than at Robert Taylor, the nation's largest housing project, much of which is "considered the worst slum area in the United States" according to its landlord, the Chicago Housing Authority.
The Hole, at the project's southern end, was the first section to go, demolished in July. But the authority wants to tear down all of the project's 28 high-rises, all 4,321 apartments.
The challenge is not just for the 11,000 people who will leave Robert Taylor, a population 99 percent black, so poor that nearly half of the adults live on less than $5,000 a year, and so isolated that many are unfamiliar with life beyond the grim monoliths that shadow the Dan Ryan Expressway on the South Side for nearly two miles.
It is a test for Chicago as housing officials try to eliminate a ghetto by placing most of Robert Taylor's tenants in private apartments. The goal is to disperse the project's concentrated poverty without introducing or aggravating social problems in the new neighborhoods. Success will require communities to accept as neighbors people they have long been happy to have out of sight. But already a pattern is emerging of tenants from housing projects being moved mainly to poor black neighborhoods, some as rundown and unsafe as the high-rises they left.
Ninety-six percent of Robert Taylor adult residents are unemployed and little may change if they are simply moved. So a second goal of Hope VI is to ease tenants off Government dependence. In Robert Taylor, the housing authority is spending $1.5 million of its initial $25 million Hope VI grant on social services, trying to place as many residents as possible in high school equivalency courses, training programs and jobs.
Some tenants need more basic help: clothes to wear to interviews with prospective landlords, help arranging electric and gas service, classes on such housekeeping skills as cleaning carpets and operating garbage disposals.
The distance between Robert Taylor and the outside world is not lost on the tenants. "Goddamn public aid penitentiary," Esther Jones, 41, said in June as she left the project after 12 years.
Other complications in relocating residents reflect the conditions at Robert Taylor.
Residents who needed temporary housing could not move for weeks because they were identified with the Mickey Cobras, the gang that controlled the Hole, while the apartments available were in a Robert Taylor building controlled by a rival gang, the Black Gangster Disciples.
Some tenants had criminal records, drug problems or erratic rent-paying habits that had been tolerated at Robert Taylor but could disqualify them for new housing.
Citywide, housing officials are trying to help tenants get the support they need, without stigmatizing them. They are also trying not to arouse community opposition to the newcomers. "I don't really need a not-in-my-backyard backlash right now," said Wanda White, the housing authority official supervising the relocation.
 
Hard-to-Place Tenants
Difficult Move To Private Sector
Angela Smith, 23, hauled out of her apartment anything broken or filthy: ice cube trays, baby shoes, a radio. She asked friends who were smoking marijuana to leave. The housekeeping inspector was coming.
"I got nowhere for people to sit," she fretted. She threw out her cockroach-infested couch and chairs a year ago. She and her children shared one bed and sat on milk crates and the hood of a large hair dryer. But roaches persisted. They crawled over her newborn son.
Like most people in the Hole, Ms. Smith was desperate to leave, but not for another housing authority apartment. Virtually all of the Hole's residents wanted Federal rent subsidies known as Section 8 certificates, which would allow them to rent their own housing.
Nationally, Hope VI wants Section 8 and the private market to replace 60 percent of the destroyed units, though some advocates for the poor worry that will worsen already severe shortages of housing and leave tenants with undesirable places to live. New York has largely ignored Hope VI because demand for its public housing is so high.
Robert Taylor is unusual because no new public housing will be built on the cleared site. Instead, smaller mixed-income developments and an industrial area are planned. Some public housing is planned nearby.
The demand for Section 8 housing makes relocating tenants harder. The housing authority's success in finding enough landlords willing to accept them in enough communities to avoid reconcentrating them has been limited since it began moving tenants from other housing projects in 1995.
According to an analysis by The Chicago Reporter, a monthly magazine that focuses on racial issues, the great majority of Section 8 placements have been in poor black neighborhoods on the South and West Sides.
Already some Robert Taylor tenants have had to move twice because of disputes with landlords or perilous conditions.
Aldermen have begun calling to say that their constituents are concerned about Section 8 tenants moving in, Ms. White said.
To find apartments for the Hole's tenants, the housing authority contracted with a private relocation agency in February. The agency's job included taking tenants to see apartments and helping with things like applications, credit checks and arranging utilities.
But tenants must satisfy landlords' expectations for cleanliness and conduct, and the housing authority expected the agency to be a hand holder: coaching tenants on how to dress for interviews, or making sure they were prepared for housekeeping inspections.
Ms. White said that after several months she replaced the agency for showing homes in too few neighborhoods and for not giving tenants enough help.
The agency's president, Pam Gecan, said her staff had expected the authority to give that help to difficult tenants. She said gunfire in the Hole sometimes made her workers afraid to visit clients. It was the tenants, she said, who tended to request certain neighborhoods, because they were familiar.
Billy Kimmons, for example, a 23-year-old former gang member who now works as a school patrol officer, was rejected by several landlords and finally moved near a church he attended in a poor minority neighborhood on the far South Side. Ms. Smith chose Woodlawn, a struggling neighborhood near Robert Taylor, because her grandmother lived there.
Ms. Smith was a typical Robert Taylor tenant, a young single mother. She said she left her mother's home at 17 because of problems with her stepfather, living on her own at Robert Taylor since. She had three children, Nathaniel, 5, Keosha, 3, and Shamari, 4 months. Her younger sister, Aderonke Akanni, who said she left home at 13 after her stepfather abused her, also lived with her.
Life in the Hole was chaotic. Ms. Smith said the father of her children beat her. She struggled on welfare, falling behind on her $44 monthly rent. She did not permit her children to play outside the apartment because gang violence made even hallways dangerous.
"It's scary," she said. "They shoot just to shoot."
Despite the turbulence, Ms. Smith and her sister were driven to improve their lives. Ms. Smith, petite and spirited, is studying for a high school equivalency diploma and plans to study nursing. Ms. Akanni, 18, works at a Lady Footlocker store and takes classes toward her equivalency diploma.
Applying for a Section 8 apartment, Ms. Smith was organized and efficient. She quickly assembled birth certificates, Social Security cards and her son's report card to prove he attended school.
But the housekeeping inspector for her new landlord was unimpressed. Ms. Smith said he complained about writing on the walls, lack of furniture and her friends -- who had moved their marijuana smoking to the hallway. Just weeks before her building was to be emptied, she failed the inspection.
Crestfallen and angry, she had to search for an apartment again, while living with her mother. Finally, in July, she got one.
"Weren't nobody smoking weed in my house," she said about failing the inspection. "And nobody going to be fixing up this raggedy place when you're fixing to move. They know this is the projects, right?"
 
Decline and Fall
Public Housing Becomes Hell Hole
The Robert Taylor Homes, named for Chicago's first black housing authority chairman, was among the last housing projects built in the city. Begun in 1959, it completed a four-mile corridor of public housing along State Street. While its new high-rises were welcome replacements for a shantytown, they quickly became the nation's largest government-sponsored ghetto.
Housing projects in Chicago are starkly identified with race and poverty. From the beginning, city officials used them, along with the expressways being built at the same time, to contain the city's growing population of poor blacks. Of Chicago's 67,000 public housing families, 97 percent are black.
In 1969, six years after completion of the last buildings, the three that became known as the Hole, Congress changed public housing policy with disastrous results for projects nationally. Instead of a fixed rent, tenants would pay a percentage of their income.
At Robert Taylor, working families moved out as their rent rose while neighbors on welfare paid almost nothing. Housing officials, wary of discrimination suits, stopped screening tenants. Single mothers as young as 16 were given apartments.
As the project filled with impoverished people, rent income fell and maintenance had to be cut. Tenants threw things off exterior gangways that linked apartments, so they were covered with steel grating, like a prison. Leaks and broken windows went unfixed. Elevators and hallways reeked of urine.
In Chicago's projects, "everything that could have gone wrong went wrong," said Joseph Shuldiner, the executive director of the housing authority, who was brought in to fix an agency so inept the Federal Government took it over in 1995.
"Once you get a population that is beginning to create problems, then you have trouble attracting people," he said. "The managers said, 'They're not letting me screen -- the heck with it.' Then your maintenance stinks. It just becomes a steamroller effect."
In a housing project with 20,000 residents at its peak but few men, gangs got an early hold. Violence and drugs devastated generations. As families moved out, vacant apartments became havens for drug dealers. Gangs ripped out metal detectors installed at entranceways and cut the wires of intercoms intended to screen visitors.
In the Hole, clusters of drug dealers brazenly hawked heroin and cocaine, forming gantlets in the entranceways. The wind whipped crack vials like shrapnel.
The police were frustrated by gang lookouts and the ability of dealers to vanish into high-rise hideouts. Dealers became so cocky that recently a gang member waved a roll of money at a group of housing officials and offered to buy the Hole for $1 million.
"I guess that's why they call it the Hole," said Deborah Mardis, a resident for 20 years. "You fall in and you never get out."
Ms. Mardis managed to leave in 1994, but her son Dequan, a gang member, kept returning. In January, visiting a girlfriend at a rival gang's building, he was shot six times. He survived.
After a shooting the next day, parents kept children home from the elementary school across a parking lot from the Hole, then formed patrols to escort them to class.
In February, a man was killed crossing from the Hole to Disciple territory. In March, postal workers did not deliver mail for a day because of shooting. One April weekend, a man was killed and another wounded. In June, a 9-year-old was shot. In August, a police officer investigating drug dealing was critically wounded. A 16-year-old and two 17-year-olds were charged.
"A long time ago, I decided that to survive here, you had to be crazy, chemically saturated, Christian, or some kind of character," said a woman called Cat Lady, a squatter in the Hole who rescued cats trapped in vacant apartments. "If we could gather the children, I'd do that."
 
Troubled Families
Stubborn Problems Hinder Relocation
Mary Bee Christian handed her sons vanilla cones she had bought from an ice cream truck and made a beeline for the bedroom with what she had bought for herself: $5 worth of crack and $20 of heroin. Using a lottery ticket to scoop the heroin and a tube from a light fixture as a crack pipe, Ms. Christian snorted and smoked her speedball.
When Willie, 7, shouted that the boys had finished eating, Ms. Christian replied, "Then watch some cartoons." When her lighter ran out of fluid, she told Willie and his brother, Jhonell, 6, to go to their room, so they would not see her light her crack pipe at the kitchen stove.
Her father, Lenzie Jones, at 61 stooped and leather-faced, watched helplessly. "Oh, Mary," he said, "Do you have to do that now?"
One of the toughest questions facing housing officials is how to deal with intensely troubled families. Their problems could not only cripple their adjustment to a new home but could also harm their new neighborhoods.
"You have to make it better for the people you are relocating," said Ms. White, the housing authority official, "but you also have to make it better for the people who will be their neighbors."
Robert Taylor has two devoted and savvy relocation specialists to work with families. In early 1997, they began untangling complications for the nearly 300 families in the Hole. Now they are doing the same in the next two buildings scheduled to come down.
Making repeated visits, sometimes working nights and weekends, they sort out who is on each lease -- and therefore entitled to new housing -- tell tenants of problems such as unpaid rent, and explain their options: Section 8 subsidies, another housing project, or "scattered site" apartments, which are managed by the authority but are not in a project. They also arrange moves, pay security deposits and visit families in their new homes.
But the authority's relocation workers face many of the same problems as the private agencies. Tenants miss appointments, waffle on housing choices, misunderstand instructions. Because few have telephones, it is difficult even to check on them.
Once families move, visiting them can take two months, because of the staff's workload.
When the relocation specialists encounter problems like drug abuse and child neglect, they refer them to the housing authority's social services department, which arranges for help from government agencies.
Responses are slow, said Ms. White, who is making improvements intended to insure families' problems are monitored closely.
Another challenge is determining if some families are so troubled that they should be turned out of public housing entirely.
Under a Federal court order in the 1970's and 1980's, Chicago moved 7,100 families out of segregated public housing and into rent-subsidized apartments. Central to the highly praised program was intensive counseling for families and its ability to screen out troubled people.
That kind of screening is much harder when entire buildings are being emptied. "That was a huge criticism, that we have people not being compassionate and it's just the get-them-out syndrome," Ms. White said. "On the flip side, you have the fear that we're just transferring problems."
In the Hole, Mr. Jones and his daughter presented one of the toughest situations. As a result, they were among the last people to leave their building, and then they moved only to temporary housing with about 25 other families with difficulties.
Trying to protect Mr. Jones and his grandchildren from his drug-addicted daughter, housing officials split them up in April. They knew that in March Ms. Christian's boyfriend hit Mr. Jones with a crowbar to make him give up the children's welfare money.
Mr. Jones was given an apartment in another Robert Taylor building for himself and the children. Ms. Christian was supposed to stay away.
Housing officials could have tried to evict Ms. Christian from the project because of her drug use. But one of the relocation specialists, Brenda Hunter, who grew up in Robert Taylor, said she knew Ms. Christian would then impose on her father, so instead she was given an apartment of her own -- rent-free, because she had no legal income.
But Ms. Christian's apartment was in the same building as her father's, and she began staying with her father and children, planning to rent or lend her apartment.
Like so many other tenants, Mr. Jones wanted a private apartment, so Ms. Hunter and her partner, Sonya Franklin, arranged an interview with CHAC Inc., the agency hired by the housing authority to see that tenants qualify financially for rent subsidies. On a late April day, he dressed up in a white hat with a yellow feather from a church giveaway, but the interview did not go well.
Since the apartment in the Hole had been leased in his daughter's name, he was told, the Section 8 program could not help him until the housing authority added his name to the lease. And because his daughter owed $250 in back rent, no one living there could get a rent subsidy until the debt was paid.
"This is the Government," the interviewer, Patrice Halliburton, said apologetically. "You can't bend the rules."
Mr. Jones wilted, bewildered by the red tape. He went back to his temporary apartment, where later that day his daughter came in with the ice cream for her boys and the drugs.
A well-meaning but overwhelmed man who had spent most of his life in housing projects, working at jobs like spray painting barrels, Mr. Jones had trouble asking for help. He had no phone. When a gang war broke out in June, even Ms. Hunter and Ms. Franklin were afraid to visit.
Once, Mr. Jones fetched the police to stop Ms. Christian and her boyfriend from stealing his furniture, clothes and the children's food. The next day, he armed himself with a meat cleaver when they tried to return.
Having lost what she called her "advertising job," shouting out to drug buyers "Hurricane" and "Chaos," the names of heroin, Ms. Christian turned to prostitution.
Ms. Christian blames herself for ravaging her family and sometimes she resolves to stop using the drugs. In June, she checked into a short-term detoxification program, then came home and read stories to her son. At other times she said, "All I know is to go out there and do my hustle and get myself some wake-up so I can function."
By late July, the family owed nearly $500 in rent and Mr. Jones's welfare payments had been cut in half because he had missed an appointment with a caseworker.
In early August, housing officials met with each of the temporarily relocated families, most of whom were behind on rent. At least four were told they would be evicted, Ms. Hunter said. No family will be permanently moved until back rent is paid.
Ms. Hunter said Mr. Jones had told her he was going to try to pay his rent so that she could begin trying to get him a Section 8 subsidy. The rent has not been paid, but Ms. Hunter said she was not giving up.
"We definitely don't want him to get left behind," she said.
 
Problems and Promise
Complex Family Poses Dilemma
Katie Sistrunk was packing, getting ready to move any day. Then, in January, the letter came.
The private agency screening people for the apartment she wanted had rejected her. The letter cited "many problems with this family," including "gang affiliation" and "poor rent-paying habits." It said two of her teen-agers had quit school "to pursue a career in crime, i.e. robbing and stalking innocent people."
Much of the letter was wrong. In part, it confused Ms. Sistrunk with a sister arrested on drug charges. It was just the first hitch in her effort to maneuver her large and complicated family through the housing bureaucracy and out of the Robert Taylor Homes.
With gravelly voice, Ms. Sistrunk is a passionate advocate for herself, 13 children, 28 grandchildren and dozens more relatives. Her family is so identified with the Hole that one son, 27-year-old Henry, wears a tattoo of the three high-rises.
But the Sistrunks also illustrate the complexities of many families in Robert Taylor. One family may have members who have succeeded against bleak odds and members whose criminal behavior could result in eviction under public housing rules, or could prevent them from getting private housing.
Over 27 years in the Hole, the Sistrunks made undeniable strides. They relied little on welfare, living mostly on income from Ms. Sistrunk's former husband. Amid squalor, the children ironed their jeans and T-shirts. Three children have attended college. One, on a basketball scholarship, expects to graduate with an architecture degree. But five of Ms. Sistrunk's grown children have criminal records, some involving weapons or drugs, court documents show.
"They've got tons of problems," Brenda Hunter, the relocation specialist, said, "but they got a lot going for them, they do."
Ms. Hunter does not volunteer sensitive information like arrests to prospective landlords. And she tried to get the private agency that rejected Ms. Sistrunk to reconsider.
"Our approach is toughness combined with natural mercy and humanity," said Joseph Shuldiner, the authority's executive director. "We have to be realistic."
In moving, Ms. Sistrunk wanted dignity and choices for her family.
She lobbied housing officials until six of her grown children got rent-subsidized apartments. Then her 24-year-old son, Joe, was charged with cocaine possession and her two youngest children, ages 16 and 17, were charged with interfering with the police during the arrest.
Charges against the teen-agers were dropped, but Joe was in jail the day he was to sign his lease. The family sent his girlfriend to sign for him.
For herself and her two youngest children, Ms. Sistrunk wanted one of the housing authority's new scattered-site apartments. She rejected one. Twice, she accepted apartments but was told they had been taken. She phoned high housing officials. Two days before her building was to be emptied, she rounded up other tenants and threatened not to leave.
"They tell me about one thing, then they switch it," she thundered.
Finally, Wanda White, while on vacation, guaranteed Ms. Sistrunk a place that she wanted so she would not have to move to temporary quarters. Aware of the Sistrunks' complicated history, Ms. White decided they had great potential to succeed.
"You have to have some flexibility to look at people individually," Ms. White said.
Ms. Sistrunk moved out in June carrying an urn with the ashes of her former husband, who died in March, salt for good luck, and her daughter's prom glass, a proud symbol of her high school graduation.
She passed a drug dealer yelling "Bubble on State," code that the police were nearby.
"I am so sick of that 'Bubble on State,' " she whispered. "What they should have did is torn it down many years ago and saved a lot of mothers' sons."

HEADLINE: High Stakes and Antes in State Races

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: RALEIGH, N.C., Sept. 2

 BODY:
Not so long ago, State Senator Edward N. Warren ran for re-election every two years by handing out combs. Thousands of combs. Thousands of green combs (because Mr. Warren is from Greenville) with his name embossed in white type.
"I'd go out to the restaurants where the farmers go for breakfast, like Tom's in Greenville and Bum's in Ayden, and I'd pass out my combs," said Mr. Warren, a 68-year-old former high school principal who has served in North Carolina's Legislature for 18 years. "I'd always just tell people that I don't have any hair, so I have no need for them." 
Mr. Warren, a Democrat, still hands out combs. But in the past four years, he has also become conversant in the modern politics of television advertising buys, polling cross-tabulations and targeted direct mail. While he once spent no more than $30,000 to hold on to his Senate seat, his 1996 campaign cost $210,000. This year, he may have to spend more.
"It's just out of control," Mr. Warren said. "I never thought I'd see it in my career, but that's the real world in North Carolina these days."
In fact, it has become the real world for lawmakers in virtually every statehouse in the 1990's. With control of legislatures at risk in a remarkable number of states, and with states inheriting vast new responsibilities from Washington, the once quaint business of legislative politics has become intensely competitive, sophisticated and costly.
After decades of hidebound, one-party domination, nearly a third of all legislative chambers are now within theoretical striking distance of a switch in partisan control. In several chambers, like the Michigan House of Representatives, the California Assembly and the Wisconsin Senate, control has changed multiple times in the last six years. To be sure, some states have long had closely contested and relatively expensive legislative elections, but now even the once-solid South, where the state legislatures were the last bastion of Democratic control, is in play.
This new competitiveness, driven largely by Republican inroads in this decade, has led to a sea change in the tactics of legislative campaigning, said dozens of lawmakers, political consultants and authorities on state government interviewed this week.
Television advertising was once considered absurdly inefficient in legislative races because media markets are typically far larger than districts. But it is now commonplace, and not just on cable. Legislative leaders make extensive use of polling to determine how to allocate their party caucuses' financial resources. Partisan messages and policy positions are formulated with the help of focus groups.
With states playing a crucial role in welfare, education, taxation and criminal justice, the national political parties are placing renewed emphasis on legislative campaigns, and so are interest groups. And the political stakes are only rising, because the elections in 1998 and 2000 will determine which parties control the redistricting process after the next census. All of that has led to skyrocketing costs -- and a need for ever-greater fund-raising.
"Targeted races are running two to three times what they cost in the early 90's," said Kevin R. Mack, director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee. "It's almost a Congressionalization of state legislative campaigns."
In California two years ago, two Assemblymen, Rusty Areias and Bruce McPherson, spent a combined $3.49 million in trying to move up to the State Senate, a race won by Mr. McPherson, a Republican. Total spending on legislative races in that state increased to $105 million in 1995-96 from $15 million in 1975-76, the Secretary of State reported.
North Carolina's recent experience demonstrates that campaign inflation is not limited to large states with high advertising rates. As the General Assembly here has become a partisan battleground, with the Republicans gaining a slim majority in the House of Representatives in 1994, the cost of campaigning has soared.
In 1996, candidates from the two major parties in North Carolina spent a total of $13.6 million on their campaigns, according to a study by Thad Beyle, a political scientist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. After accounting for inflation, that was an increase of 81 percent over the amount spent in 1994, and an increase of 172 percent over 1992, Mr. Beyle reported.
The main reason for the increase in spending is that legislative politics have destabilized in the 1990's after decades of calm.
From 1972 to 1994, Democrats were as prevalent in state legislatures as plaid sport coats. They controlled the majority of statehouses and exerted little effort in maintaining their power. They were particularly dominant in the South in those years, a period when Democrats controlled every legislative chamber and never held fewer than 71 percent of the region's legislative seats, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
In North Carolina, the Democratic campaign strategy consisted of little more than "hearing at the grocery store that Senator Joe was in trouble and sending him $500," said Senator Roy A. Cooper, the Democratic majority leader. But in 1994, as Republicans took control of Congress, they also asserted themselves on the state level. Republicans entered that election with control of 8 legislatures and emerged with 19, while the Democrats were left with 18. Twelve legislatures were divided with each party controlling one chamber.
Two years later, the Democrats rebounded a bit, taking control in 20 states to the Republicans' 18, with 11 states divided. In the South, Democrats hold only 62 percent of all seats, and Republicans control both chambers in Florida and Virginia, as well as the House of Representatives in North Carolina and South Carolina and the Senate in Texas.
This year, in the 46 states with elections in at least one house, the parties are separated by six seats or fewer in 23 chambers, a staggering level of competitiveness.
Adding to the instability is the onset of term limits, which will dislodge large numbers of incumbents in several states. In Michigan, for instance, where Democrats hold a 6-seat majority in the House, term limits will open 67 of 110 seats this year. In the Arkansas House, 49 of 100 seats will be open because of term limits.
Even as they consult pollsters and cut television ads, many lawmakers lament that the new professionalism of legislative politics has transformed their political culture.
Like their Congressional counterparts, they complain that fund-raising monopolizes their time. The reliance on big money has given new power to legislative leaders and their centralized fund-raising committees, which collect contributions for their party caucuses and then distribute cash to the most vulnerable members. It has heightened the influence of lobbyists, interest groups and political action committees.
Here in North Carolina, Senator John H. Kerr, a Democrat from Goldsboro, used to shun money from political action committees on principle. This year, Mr. Kerr said, he can no longer afford to be pure.
"When your opponent is running 30-second commercials and dropping all these mailings," Mr. Kerr said, "you've got to be able to combat that, to do background research, to poll."
Representative Daniel T. Blue Jr., a Democrat from Raleigh and a former Speaker of the House, said the cost of campaigning had made public service "unachievable for ordinary folk." The influence of check-bearing lobbyists, Mr. Blue said, "just pervades everything that goes on here."
All too often, he added, policy proposals seem to be shaped by out-of-state pollsters with an eye on November. Compromise is often sacrificed for political positioning.
This week, for instance, the General Assembly here was deadlocked over a proposal by House Republicans to eliminate the state's inheritance tax. Senate Democrats agreed to a partial repeal, but Republicans did not budge. "Apparently it polls very well," Mr. Blue said.
The impasse in Raleigh has contributed to the longest legislative session in the state's history. And legislative leaders worry that the demands on lawmakers' time will make it difficult to recruit candidates for an increasingly full-time job that pays $13,951 a year and $104 a day in expenses. Senator Leslie J. Winner, a Democrat from Charlotte, is quitting this year after three terms because the job now keeps her apart too often from her 9-year-old daughter, Lily. One of Lily's poems, which Ms. Winner has posted in her office, is "dedicated to my mother, who's always in Raleigh."

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sunday about the increasing cost and competitiveness of state legislative elections misstated the party control of the Virginia Legislature. Republicans do not control both chambers; they control the Senate, and Democrats hold a narrow margin in the House of Delegates. There are 50 Democrats, 49 Republicans and 1 independent in that body, and the Speaker is a Democrat.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS IN TURMOIL: A LONG VIEW;
Veteran of '87 Sees Less Cause for Alarm

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
AS the world's stock markets wobble wildly, Asian economies sink into recession, Russia slams the door on its creditors and American and foreign financial institutions make provisions for billions in losses, the Treasury and the Federal Reserve are hastily dusting off their primers on financial crisis management.
Amid the current turmoil, few of the world's financial leaders have much to say publicly. But some who have seen markets plunge before believe the reaction to recent events is overwrought. 
 One is E. Gerald Corrigan, who as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for a decade was the nation's financial fireman at the time of the 1987 stock market crash.
There is suddenly too much pessimism, Mr. Corrigan said in an interview last week. Stressing the current capital strength of the American financial system and the absence of major credit problems, he argued that the world was better positioned to withstand stress than it had been in the 1980's.
"Suddenly all news is bad news, after a period when all news is good news," said Mr. Corrigan, 57, now a managing director at Goldman, Sachs & Company. "The truth, as always, lies somewhere in between."
In an interview from Montana, where he was on vacation after the Kansas City Federal Reserve's annual conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo., Mr. Corrigan underscored that he is today a Wall Streeter, without inside knowledge of Government efforts to deal with the new round of turbulence. It has been nearly five years since he stepped down as president of the New York Fed after a long career.
Yet as Mr. Corrigan readily acknowledges, there is some truth to the maxim "Once a central banker, always a central banker." And he is married to one, as well; last October, he wed Cathy E. Minehan, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. Mr. Corrigan, the Fed and Goldman, Sachs have all said they have established procedures to guard against potential conflicts of interest.
While the roots of today's turmoil are structural problems in Asia's economy -- weak banking systems, for example, and Japan's paralysis -- the surprise is that Russia is now roiling world markets, Mr. Corrigan said. He called the country "kind of the wild card."
That, he said, is "because while its economy is nowhere near big enough to have much effect on world markets," it has caused "political anxiety, and its contagion effect has been greater than anyone expected."
What "got markets very nervous" about Russia, he said, was the Government's declaration, effectively, of a unilateral moratorium on paying both foreign and domestic bonds and its further moratorium on the foreign currency liabilities of Russian companies.
Such steps are anathema to central bankers, Mr. Corrigan said. Debt moratoriums "fundamentally seem to be so in conflict with the whole fabric of the credit system," he said.
"This raises the question:, If it could happen there, could it happen somewhere else?" he added.
Still, Mr. Corrigan argued, the prospect of debt repudiation is not as threatening as it was in the 1980's. "If you look at the system as a whole, we are not nearly as leveraged as we were in the mid- to late 80's," he said. "Some institutions will take some lumps here. But none of this should be remotely life-threatening for the system."
That is a sharp contrast to the days after Black Monday in 1987, when the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 22.8 percent in a single trading session. "If you go back to the stock market crash of '87, especially the Tuesday or Wednesday, every newspaper was laden with stories about credit problems," Mr. Corrigan recalled. "That's not the question today."
Instead, the question today is how to prevent the collapse of economies in countries ranging from Thailand to Russia. Asked what remedies he might suggest, Mr. Corrigan referred to "Sovereign Financial Crises: Facing Realities and Building a More Secure Future," a paper he wrote in May. It strongly suggests that prevention is far preferable to searching for cures.
"Once a crisis strikes, the country, its creditors, its investors and the official community are left with nothing but bad choices," the paper states. Mr. Corrigan argues instead for better and more prompt dissemination of economic information, tougher conditions on lending, increased financial resources for the International Monetary Fund and stronger banking systems.
From his office at Goldman, Sachs, Mr. Corrigan has had a hand in trying to manage some of the recent crises. He has advised South Korea and Thailand as those countries seek to pull themselves up from Asia's continuing woes; earlier, he consulted with the Mexican and Argentine Governments.
At the New York Fed in the early 1990's, Mr. Corrigan also worked with Russian leaders, forming a friendship with President Boris N. Yeltsin and becoming chairman of the Russian-American bankers' forum, which has sought to provide training and technical help to the Russian banking system.
Despite the current tangle of international financial problems, Mr. Corrigan keeps faith in the world's ability to withstand the current buffeting. "Financial markets are really quite resilient," he said. "They really can handle most things -- unless there is the perception or reality of major credit problems in the system."
