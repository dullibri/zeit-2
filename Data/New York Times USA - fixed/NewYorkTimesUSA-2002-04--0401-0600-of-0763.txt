HEADLINE: Versace Family Seeks Partners to RegainControl of Stores 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE KAUFMAN and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 

 BODY:
The family-owned fashion design house of Gianni Versace S.p.A. -- most famous for dressing celebrities in clingy and revealing gowns -- is trying to sell a minority stake to outsiders, according to executives who have been approached by the company. 
 The Versaces want to raise about $176 million in cash for a three-year program that would include renovating older stores, repurchasing franchised stores and expanding a leather goods and accessory line. Roughly $26 million of the amount raised, the executives said, would go straight to the family to pay off estate taxes that were incurred when the family sold the art collection and homes of Gianni Versace, the company's founder, after he was killed in 1997. 
 The design house began approaching private firms within the last two weeks, and Versace executives are leaving it to prospective partners to value the $176 million stake as a percentage of the company. Some executives think the cash would be worth roughly 35 to 40 percent of the company. Versace has not released final sales figures for 2001, but expects them to approach $450 million. 
The private equity firms approached include the Texas Pacific Group based in the United States and two British firms, CVC Capital Partners and Doughty Hanson, all of whom declined comment or could not be reached. Any deal could take several months to complete. 
Although selling a majority stake in the firm would be more appealing to investors, the Versaces are not willing to sell a stake in the firm so large that control might pass out of their hands, according to executives close to the deal.
The decision to raise money in the private market indicates that, for now, the company has shelved its plans for an initial public offering of stock, which it had been considering at the time of Gianni Versace's death.
Versace executives confirmed yesterday that they were in negotiations for the financing. The company would comment no further except to say that the cash was necessary to help Versace pursue its strategy of buying back control of its own stores and merchandise.
Versace currently has 112 stores, but 89 are owned by franchisees. The company recently bought back control of seven United States stores and a majority stake in the company that runs its Asian operations.
"We are continuing to implement a plan, which began in 2000, to take control of and invest in the company," said Lou Colasuonno, a spokesman for Versace. "And it takes capital for growth."
The negotiations offer the first glimpse of how the closely held company has fared since its founder and design visionary, Gianni Versace, was shot outside his Miami Beach villa in 1997.
Since his death, the company has continued to produce its couture line and other more affordable brands under the creative direction of his sister, Donatella, selling lines like Versace Jeans, Versus, Versace Sport and Versace Classic. Santo Versace, Gianni's brother and business partner, has continued to mind the company's finances.
Mr. Versace's two siblings and Donatella's daughter, Allegra Beck, now own the company in its entirety.
Despite Mr. Versace's untimely death, the house has managed to maintain the quality most important yet most ethereal for a fashion house: cachet. Versace gowns still adorn stars at major award presentations -- Jennifer Lopez, for example, wore a girlish bubble-gum pink number to this year's Academy Awards. Chelsea Clinton, Madonna and Gwyneth Paltrow were much photographed at the Versace couture show in Paris in January. And Versace's fall ready-to-wear collection, which was on the runways in Milan last month, got rave reviews from the style press.
Still, sales have not fully rebounded since Gianni Versace's death. The year he died, the company reported annual sales of $560 million. The company reported sales of $374 million in 1999 and $392 million in 2000. 
There have also been large expenditures. In 2000, Versace began its effort to take control of all aspects of producing and selling its merchandise. Vertical integration is the only way a design company can totally control its own image, something that is increasingly considered a must in luxury retailing. But it is expensive, and the effort is a major factor in Versace's attempts to sell a stake in the company. 
To keep up with Gucci, the gold standard in the high-fashion business, Versace also wants to renovate stores that have grown shabby under the care of other owners. And the company wants money to expand its leather goods and accessory lines, highly profitable businesses for other fashion houses.
News that Versace is shopping around for an investor comes as the European luxury market, red hot last year, has gone cold.
A sharp economic slowdown in America has cut into sales of many luxury brands. LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the most voracious of Europe's acquirers of luxury brands, has experienced a slump in cash flow after paying steep prices for Donna Karan International and Fendi.

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day yesterday about plans by the fashion design house of Gianni Versace to sell a minority stake to outsiders included an erroneous number from the company for its stores. Versace owns 112 stores directly; 89 others are owned by franchisees. The total is not 112.

HEADLINE: Chavez Offers Words of Reconciliation 

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, April 15 

 BODY:
President Hugo Chavez, addressing worried Venezuelans a day after he regained power when an attempt to oust him failed, abandoned his familiar combative style today and reached out to his opponents with messages of reconciliation. 
 In a speech he delivered before reporters at the presidential palace, the scene of his triumphant return, Mr. Chavez acknowledged that popular discontent had generated the huge protest that forced him from office for 48 hours. He said he was "anguished" by the violence in which at least 14 anti-government demonstrators were killed. 
 He said that he bore no grudges, and that he was willing to listen to the grievances of an opposition that draws its support from Venezuela's small but influential upper and middle classes.
"We do not hate, that is a lie," the president said in a speech that lasted two hours and 20 minutes. "There is no hate in my heart for the upper classes of Venezuela. We are not in a time of hate. We are in a time of love."
The tone of the speech, and the news conference that followed it, was a startling break with the past. Before he was toppled briefly by a surging opposition movement led by business and labor leaders and dissident military officers, Mr. Chavez had rarely offered a kind word for the Venezuelan elite, whom he called "subversives" who should move to Miami.
But questions abounded here about whether Mr. Chavez, a former paratrooper elected in 1998 on a pledge to reshape Venezuela to benefit the poor, had really changed his political outlook. Mr. Chavez's aggressive moves to intervene in the management of the state-owned oil industry, take control of unions and impose tight control on the National Assembly had polarized the society.
Mr. Chavez has sought to signal that he is prepared for some change.
Today he announced that he would organize "round-table" discussions between government officials and opposition leaders, beginning next week, to attempt to resolve disputes.
Mr. Chavez also said he and leaders of the Catholic Church "are capable of accepting our differences so that we can have dialogue and cooperation." In the past, he referred to clergy as "devils in vestments."
Referring to the United States, which did not conceal its satisfaction with his ouster, the president appeared to give Washington the benefit of the doubt. "I think they were victims of misinformation," he said.
At the same time, Mr. Chavez made it clear that he continued to be in charge and that he was not prepared to alter the course of his populist revolution. The government will move forward with policies that have riled Mr. Chavez's opposition, like a controversial land reform, officials said.
However, seeking to quell concerns about possible repression, Jose Vicente Rangel, the defense minister and a close ally of the president, said the cabinet members selected on Friday for the short-lived interim government had been released from custody. 
Pedro Carmona Estanga, the businessman who was sworn in as interim president that day, was released from state security headquarters and sent home under house arrest. Looking tired, he told reporters he had been treated well.
"I reiterate my most sincere wish for peace in the country," he said. "Let us hope that all the events that happened lead to the reconciliation and reunification of Venezuelans."
Mr. Rangel, the defense minister, echoed Mr. Chavez at the Miraflores presidential palace, saying, "The entire government is ready to make changes." 
On Sunday, just hours after military commanders and crowds of protesters loyal to him had reclaimed the presidential palace, Mr. Chavez announced that the board of directors he had appointed to the state-owned oil firm, Petroleos de Venezuela, had resigned. The appointment angered executives at the traditionally autonomous company, a pillar of Venezuela's economy, whose protests evolved into a general strike, which led to Mr. Chavez's short-lived removal.
Mr. Chavez acknowledged today that some of his supporters were armed during street disturbances on Thursday and he suggested that they could be responsible for some of the violence that led to opposition protesters' deaths that day. The killings sparked a rebellion by some military commanders. 
After retaking the government, Mr. Chavez's ministers angrily denied those initial accusations, saying that most of those who died were the president's supporters and even government workers. But today Mr. Chavez made a startling admission.
"I don't deny it -- it would be false to say that there was no gunfire from our side to theirs," Mr. Chavez said. "In fact, there is evidence that some of our supporters were armed -- but not only our people." 
Still, in Venezuela and abroad, where Venezuela's political situation moves the oil markets, there was skepticism about Mr. Chavez's ability or desire to be conciliatory. On Sunday, in a speech at a military base, he referred to the protest leaders as oligarchs, a term he often uses to deride opponents.
The price of oil, which had fallen upon news of Mr. Chavez's ouster on Friday, rose today as concerns were raised about the future of Petroleos de Venezuela.
Analysts said that Mr. Chavez remained on unsteady ground. Mr. Chavez has the support of only about 34 percent of Venezuelans, according to a poll in March. Perhaps most troubling for his government are doubts about the military's loyalty. 
At least 20 generals and admirals are jailed now and facing charges for their role in the uprising, with dozens of lower-ranking officers also in custody. The depth of the allegiance of those officers who remained with Mr. Chavez is unclear. 
At Petroleos de Venezuela, which was trying to get back to normal after severe disruptions in the production and export of oil, the same office workers who had led protests against Mr. Chavez remained skittish. One top executive, Eddie Ramirez, whose firing along with a handful of other executives on Sunday energized protesters, wondered about his future and that of the company.
"If they don't reinstate the ones who were retired, the corporation could come tumbling down," said Mr. Ramirez, explaining that the loss of experienced managers was damaging to the company.

HEADLINE: Losing Latin America 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Many people, myself included, would agree that Hugo Chavez is not the president Venezuela needs. He happens, however, to be the president Venezuela elected -- freely, fairly and constitutionally. That's why all the democratic nations of the Western Hemisphere, however much they may dislike Mr. Chavez, denounced last week's attempted coup against him. 
 All the democratic nations, that is, except one. 
 Here's how the BBC put it: "Far from condemning the ouster of a democratically elected president, U.S. officials blamed the crisis on Mr. Chavez himself," and they were "clearly pleased with the result" -- even though the new interim government proceeded to abolish the legislature, the judiciary and the Constitution. They were presumably less pleased when the coup attempt collapsed. The BBC again: "President Chavez's comeback has . . . left Washington looking rather stupid." The national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, didn't help that impression when, incredibly, she cautioned the restored president to "respect constitutional processes."
Surely the worst thing about this episode is the betrayal of our democratic principles; "of the people, by the people, for the people" isn't supposed to be followed by the words "as long as it suits U.S. interests."
But even viewed as realpolitik, our benign attitude toward Venezuela's coup was remarkably foolish. 
It is very much in our interest that Latin America break out of its traditional political cycle, in which crude populism alternated with military dictatorship. Everything that matters to the U.S. -- trade, security, drugs, you name it -- will be better if we have stable neighbors.
But how can such stability be achieved? In the 1990's there seemed, finally, to be a formula; call it the new world order. Economic reform would end the temptations of populism; political reform would end the risk of dictatorship. And in the 1990's, on their own initiative but with encouragement from the United States, most Latin American nations did indeed embark on a dramatic process of reform both economic and political.
The actual results have been mixed. On the economic side, where hopes were initially highest, things have not gone too well. There are no economic miracles in Latin America, and there have been some notable disasters, Argentina's crisis being the latest. The best you can say is that some of the disaster victims, notably Mexico, seem to have recovered their balance (with a lot of help, one must say, from the Clinton administration) and moved onto a path of steady, but modest, economic growth. 
Yet economic disasters have not destabilized the region. Mexico's crisis in 1995, Brazil's crisis in 1999, even Argentina's current crisis did not deliver those countries into the hands either of radicals or of strongmen. The reason is that the political side has gone better than anyone might have expected. Latin America has become a region of democracies -- and these democracies seem remarkably robust.
So while the U.S. may have hoped for a new Latin stability based on vibrant prosperity, what it actually got was stability despite economic woes, thanks to democracy. Things could be a lot worse.
Which brings us to Venezuela. Mr. Chavez is a populist in the traditional mold, and his policies have been incompetent and erratic. Yet he was fairly elected, in a region that has come to understand the importance of democratic legitimacy. What did the United States hope to gain from his overthrow? True, he has spouted a lot of anti-American rhetoric, and been a nuisance to our diplomacy. But he is not a serious threat.
Yet there we were, reminding everyone of the bad old days when any would-be right-wing dictator could count on U.S. backing.
As it happens, we aligned ourselves with a peculiarly incompetent set of plotters. Mr. Chavez has alienated a broad spectrum of his people; the demonstrations that led to his brief overthrow began with a general strike by the country's unions. But the short-lived coup-installed government included representatives of big business and the wealthy -- full stop. No wonder the coup collapsed.
But even if the coup had succeeded, our behavior would have been very stupid. We had a good thing going -- a new hemispheric atmosphere of trust, based on shared democratic values. How could we so casually throw it away?

HEADLINE: Congressman Asks Chase to Explain Enron Loans 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, April 15 

 BODY:
J. P. Morgan Chase has been asked by a House Democrat to explain its role in a series of loans to Enron partnerships that may have helped to keep debt off the books.
 Representative Henry A. Waxman, a California Democrat involved in Congressional investigations into the collapse of Enron, asked J. P. Morgan to provide details about loans to several Enron-related entities that he says allowed a partnership called Sequoia to avoid recording debt. Mr. Waxman is seeking information about each loan transaction and whether J .P. Morgan intended them to help Enron improve its financial statements. 
 Transactions involving the Sequoia partnership "do not appear to have served a legitimate economic purpose," Mr. Waxman wrote to William B. Harrison Jr., J. P. Morgan's president and chief executive. "Rather, on their face, they appear to have been designed to allow Enron to covertly borrow hundreds of millions of dollars in undisclosed loans."
Congress is stepping up its investigation into the role investment banks played in Enron's bankruptcy, the largest in United States history. The House Energy and Commerce Committee, on which Mr. Waxman serves, sent letters last month to J. P. Morgan and eight other banks requesting information, including whether Enron pressed them to make investments.
J. P. Morgan and the other banks are also facing shareholder lawsuits that contend the banks made billions in fees for helping to set up Enron partnerships that were little more than "Ponzi schemes" that helped inflate the company's stock price.
J. P. Morgan has filed its own lawsuit that seeks to force Enron to release more than $2.1 billion it says Enron is holding on the bank's behalf. Mr. Waxman indicated that court filings by J. P. Morgan in that case are raising a new line of inquiry for Congressional investigators looking at five partnerships: Sequoia, Choctaw, Cherokee, Zephyrus and Enron Finance Partners.

HEADLINE: Tax Treaties With Small Nations Turn Into a New Shield for Profits 

BYLINE:  By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Some large companies, encouraged by top law and accounting firms, are adopting a new strategy to cut taxes legally on profits they make in this country.
 The technique works this way: A company transfers profits earned in America to a paper company in another country, like Barbados or Luxembourg, that has a special kind of tax treaty with the United States. 
 These treaties, originally intended to serve American economic interests abroad, allow companies through accounting sleight of hand to transform taxable profits into expenses that they can deduct on their American tax return. These tax-deductible expenses include interest payments to the overseas company, royalties for use of the company's logo and fees for management advice from the overseas company.
The paper company then sends the money to the United States company's worldwide headquarters in Bermuda, which has no income tax and is the tax haven of choice for many companies. In short, what once were taxable profits have been turned into virtually untaxed dollars for use anywhere in the world. 
Large publicly traded companies can use this method to reduce taxes on American profits to as little as 11 percent, from an average of 21.5 percent.
Nabors Industries and Weatherford Industries, two oil drilling services companies in Houston, and Stanley Works, a Connecticut maker of hammers and other hand tools, are among the first companies preparing to use the strategy to reduce taxes paid to the American government on profits earned in the United States. Other companies with headquarters in Bermuda, including Tyco International, Ingersoll-Rand and the consulting firm Accenture, have adopted other methods to accomplish the same goal.
The new techniques are being promoted by leading accounting and law firms, said Beth Brooke, a vice chairman of Ernst & Young, the accounting and consulting firm. 
Accounting and consulting firms advising on these strategies include Arthur Andersen, Deloitte & Touche, KPMG, PricewaterhouseCoopers and Grant Thornton. The top law firms include Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom; Baker & McKenzie; Sutherland, Asbill & Brennan; and Arnold & Porter.
"Everyone wants this business," said the general counsel of one company using one of the methods, who spoke on the condition that neither he nor his employer be identified. 
Several dozen companies were already using part of this technique -- incorporating in Bermuda while keeping their headquarters in the United States -- to eliminate their taxes on profits made overseas. Senators Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, and Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, introduced legislation last week to close the loophole, which was disclosed in The New York Times in February.
But the new strategies go beyond the techniques addressed in the legislation. The key is to use treaties with Barbados, Luxembourg and other havens. Companies need the third country and a Bermuda headquarters because the United States does not have a tax treaty with Bermuda.
One leading tax lawyer, David P. Hariton of Sullivan & Cromwell in New York, said he expected the debate to shift once members of Congress and citizens understood the impact on American tax revenues.
"If the transaction serves only to eliminate the U.S. tax on foreign-source income, there are good policy arguments for allowing it," Mr. Hariton said. "If, on the other hand, it serves to eliminate U.S. tax on U.S. income then the transaction is of greater concern."
Nabors Industries, the largest oil drilling services company in the United States, is one corporation preparing to use the tax-avoidance techniques. It has proposed to its shareholders an incorporation as a Bermuda company that would have its legal residence in Barbados. To qualify the company as a resident of Barbados, the Nabors chief executive, Eugene M. Isenberg, simply has to meet with his directors once a year on that island, experts said.
Because of the tax treaty, dollars can be moved untaxed from the company's taxable American pocket to its Barbados pocket, from which 99 percent of the money can then move on to tax-free Bermuda and remain in the hands of the company.
These companies are then free to invest the money anywhere. Weatherford International, another oil services company, said in documents sent to investors that its arrangement means that it will be able to "commit additional capital to international expansion" and "will facilitate the cost-effective acquisition and operation of non-U.S. business."
By creating a tax triangle out of the United States, Bermuda and a country like Barbados or Luxembourg, and pushing every rule to the limit, companies can legally pay as little as 11 percent of their American profits in taxes to the United States, said Richard E. Andersen, a tax lawyer at Arnold & Porter in New York and author of "Income Tax Treaties of the U.S.," a tax guide published by Warren Gorham & Lamont. 
Congress imposes a 35 percent tax on profits of large companies, but after taking advantage of deductions and loopholes, the largest 9,669 companies paid an average of 21.5 percent of their profits in American income taxes in 1998, the latest data from the Internal Revenue Service shows. These taxes totaled $141.6 billion, or nearly 18 percent of the total income taxes paid by companies and individuals.
Just how much companies expect to save on taxes on their United States profits is not known because the companies have not disclosed it.
One of the most common of the new tax avoidance techniques, which does not yet have a commonly used name, works this way. First, a company reincorporates in Bermuda or a similar tax haven where there is no income tax and where all it needs is a mail drop. That allows the company to eliminate American taxes on its profits overseas.
How much companies pay in taxes on their overseas profits depends on which countries they operate in and their tax strategies. But most of those using this arrangement have said they expect to lower worldwide income taxes from more than a third of their profits to a quarter or less.
The key to the new method is setting up a paper company in a third country that has a tax treaty with the United States allowing companies to move large amounts of money to an overseas parent company and to reclassify these formerly taxable profits as deductions. 
For example, the profits made in the United States can be shipped abroad tax free in the form of royalties for using the company's logo, the rights to which are owned by the overseas parent. As another example, the overseas parent can lend money to the American operation, which uses its United States profits to pay interest, for which it takes a deduction. The overseas parent can also charge management fees for services provided to its American subsidiary, and, once again, be paid from once-taxable profits. 
Without the Barbados or Luxembourg connection, however, the ability to reduce American taxes on American profits is limited by other tax rules.
Companies using the techniques, asked about it last week, either did not respond, declined to comment or reiterated previous remarks about eliminating American taxes on profits earned outside the United States.
"We are pretty much radio silent these days" on taxes, said Paul Dickard, a spokesman for Ingersoll-Rand, an industrial manufacturer that maintains its operating headquarters in Woodcliff Lake, N.J.
Under current rules, only publicly traded companies can take advantage of these techniques. Individual Americans are taxed on their worldwide income whether they live in the United States or overseas, making a Bermuda mail drop worthless to them. The treaties exclude family-owned businesses, partnerships and professional corporations.
Lawyers and accountants who are promoting the strategies -- they charge hourly fees for this kind of work -- say that Congress is forcing companies into them by not modernizing the corporate income tax. 
Typical of these statements were remarks by Ms. Brooke of Ernst & Young, who said that "to become globally competitive, companies have to unshackle themselves from the arcane U.S. tax system that in essence results in U.S. company profits being taxed in multiple places."
Ms. Brooke acknowledged that companies that do this can also pay lower taxes on profits earned in the United States. "The issue is global competitiveness and that includes taxes paid in the United States on profits earned there," she said.
Mr. Andersen, the tax treaty expert, said the techniques were quite legal. "Congress wrote the statute and the I.R.S. wrote regulations that not only allow this, but give signposts on a perfectly clear road map" showing how to move to a tax haven like Bermuda and take advantage of a second country's tax treaty, Mr. Andersen said. 
"If Congress wants to say this is a time of war and you can't do this anymore and if you do we will put you in handcuffs and throw you in prison that is fine with me," he added. "But until they do, it is perfectly appropriate to do what the law provides."
But Lee Sheppard, a lawyer whose essays in the journal Tax Notes are read by experts in legal tax avoidance, disagreed. "I do not believe for one second that abusing these treaties is what Congress intended," she said.
"Nobody in Congress said you can pretend to be resident in Barbados and not pay your taxes," she added.
"The real problem here is that Congress trusts these guys to act responsibly and so do the tax administrators at Treasury and the I.R.S., and no one who writes the laws and the treaties and the regulations ever thought they would behave like this."
Treasury Department officials, who oversee the tax collection system, said the new strategies reveal "inadequacies in our current tax rules that can be taken advantage of" by companies.
"We are aware that these types of transactions may be used to reduce the U.S. taxes paid on U.S. income," said Mark A. Weinberger, Treasury assistant secretary for tax policy. "That is one of the reasons we are so concerned about the marked increase in the number and size of these transactions."
It was not immediately clear how the provisions creating the loopholes were written into the treaties. Experts said there were several ways to close the loopholes, including renegotiating the treaties and rewriting the rules on what constitutes a corporate headquarters for tax purposes. 
Senators Baucus and Grassley, who introduced the legislation to close the Bermuda loophole, said the new techniques might require further legislation.
"The companies reincorporating in tax haven countries, and their executives, are still physically located in the United States," Senator Baucus said. "Their executives and employees enjoy all the privileges afforded to honest U.S. taxpayers."
The new strategies, Mr. Baucus said, are "making a mockery of honest taxpayers." 
"We need to continue to step up efforts to ensure that they pay their fair share," he added.
Mr. Grassley has said that using the Bermuda methods is unpatriotic.
Both senators said that while they wanted to end these techniques, they would also investigate how to overhaul the corporate tax system and close loopholes.

HEADLINE: Broadcasting the War 

BYLINE:  By Max Rodenbeck; Max Rodenbeck is Middle East correspondent for The Economist and author of "Cairo: The City Victorious."

DATELINE: CAIRO 

 BODY:
Bahrain is as far from Ramallah as Bermuda is from ground zero. Yet it was a Palestinian flag that shrouded the body of Muhammad Jumaa, a Bahraini janitor felled by a policeman's plastic bullet in a protest at the American embassy, when he was buried last week. He was hailed as the latest martyr for Palestine.
Never, in a half century of Middle Eastern conflict, have ordinary Arabs so identified with the Palestinian tragedy as they do today. As network coverage of Vietnam shocked Americans with the immediacy of a far-off war, satellite television's insistent, graphic imagery of the intifada has taken its bloody drama into millions of Arab households. 
 Before Israel's reinvasion of the West Bank, neither its own leaders nor America's appear to have appreciated how the new power and reach of the Arab media could work against the Israelis. While other Arabs have always taken the Palestinians' side, the violent images are increasing the sense of personal interest in the conflict. When half a million Moroccans marched in a recent protest against Israel, many carried placards saying, "We are all Palestinians." 
 The perspective is different, of course, from that of Americans watching the televised war in Vietnam. Arabs see the current conflict through "Vietnamese" eyes -- as the story of a kindred people fighting to rid their land of a brutal occupying army. The drama generates not weariness with war but a thirst for justice, for sacrifice and revenge.
Some may dismiss such passions as the product of propaganda, and it is true that the region's news media are hardly beyond reproach. Hezbollah runs a technically impressive and visually compelling satellite channel that beams nonstop incitement to attack "the Zionist enemy." Even Al Jazeera, the most editorially sophisticated of the Arab satellite channels, stoops to hyperbolic use of terms like genocide to describe Israel's iron-fisted methods. More often than not, Israeli losses are passed off lightly. 
Stories of Palestinian casualties, by contrast, are textured with memory. Some have become household names from Morocco to Muscat: Muhammad al-Dura, the 12-year-old boy from Gaza whose father could not shield him from a hail of Israeli gunfire; or Wafa Idris and Ayat al-Akhras, the first female suicide bombers, who were the objects of a tribute by Egyptian movie stars during a charity performance at Cairo's opera house.
Yet Arab coverage of the conflict is not really much more one-sided than, say, America's gung-ho coverage of the Persian Gulf war. (Or, for that matter, Israeli reporting on the intifada: Most Tel Aviv editors seem to accept Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's view that the press's job is "to give the nation pride and hope.") The fact is that Arab television, radio, newspapers and magazines have come a long way in recent years. Gone is the time when Arabs had to turn for the truth to the BBC, as in the Six Day War of 1967, when Egyptians learned from London of a calamitous defeat even as Cairo trumpeted triumph.
In the heyday of Arab nationalism, in the 1960's, it was said that the sound of battle should drown all other voices -- that there should be no dissent. Now that private satellite channels vie with state broadcasters and Arabic dailies published in London compete with local newspapers, there are multiple voices. Some, like Al Jazeera, rival and sometimes surpass Western models for the quality and timeliness of their reporting. It was Al Jazeera that broke the story of the April 7 ambush in Jenin in which Israel lost 14 men.
To an extent, it is the very modernity of today's Arab media that fuels passions. Television has a natural penchant for stripping events of their historical context, instead framing them as a sequence of climaxes under one dramatic heading, like "America's War on Terror." Yet it does not really require subtle manipulation to frame the ongoing tragedy as an epic struggle of the weak against the strong. The imagery saturating Arab screens, of tanks crushing ambulances and helicopters rocketing refugee camps, is, alas, all too real.

Mining a Revenue Stream

BYLINE:  By ROBERT SHAROFF 

 BODY:
"I call it stadia-mania," Martin Greenberg said of the wave of stadium construction in the last decade. Mr. Greenberg is managing director of ScheerGame, a sports and entertainment development and consulting firm in Milwaukee, and author of "The Stadium Game" (Marquette University Press, 2001), a book on stadium development.
 By the end of the 1990's, he said, 46 percent of all major league sports teams were playing in stadiums that were less than 10 years old. 
 A major reason for the new projects, Mr. Greenberg said, is the rise of premium seating -- like sky boxes, club seats and so-called personal-seat licenses -- as a major source of revenue for team and stadium owners. 
Football sky boxes, in particular, are seen as desirable, as the money from these amenities, unlike revenue from general gate receipts and personal-seat licenses, is not subject to the National Football League's rules on revenue sharing.
"It' a huge economic incentive for N.F.L. clubs," said Matthew Mitten, director of the National Sports Law Institute at Marquette Law School in Milwaukee. 
At the new Soldier Field, sky boxes are to be priced from $70,000 to $300,000 a year, while full-price club seat buyers will pay $195 to $315 a game, in addition to a one-time licensing fee of $2,900 to $10,000 a seat.
These prices put the Bears near the top for premium seating. According to Media Ventures, a publishing company in Milwaukee that tracks stadium revenues, sky boxes start as low as $24,000 for the Atlanta Falcons at the Georgia Dome and go as high as $358,000 for the New York Jets at Giants Stadium. It said that prices for club seats start at $440 a year for the Buffalo Bills at Ralph Wilson Stadium and top out at $6,000 a year for the New England Patriots at CMGI Field in Foxboro, Mass.

HEADLINE: Though Coke Reports Loss, Some Foresee Better Days 

BYLINE:  By GREG WINTER 

 BODY:
Despite a long-awaited resurgence in soda sales, Coca-Cola announced a $125 million loss for the first quarter yesterday, primarily because of required mandatory changes in its accounting methods and the dwindling value of its plants in ailing economies of Latin America. 
 Although revenue rose 3 percent for the quarter, to $4.08 billion from $3.96 billion in the period a year earlier, net income dropped by almost $1 billion. The bulk of that decrease stemmed from a required overhaul in the way companies account for their acquisitions -- a shift that, almost alone, produced a loss of 5 cents a share, in contrast to a profit of 38 cents a share a year earlier. 
Without the accounting changes, or the $157 million cost of writing down assets in Latin America, mostly in Argentina, Coke's earnings fell a penny shy of the 38 cents a share analysts had forecast. The company cited weakness in the Japanese yen, the Argentine peso, the Venezuelan bolivar and the South African rand as causes for its performance. 
Yet behind the loss, the beginnings of a turnaround promised by Douglas N. Daft, Coke's chief executive, seemed visible. After years of little movement, Coke's sales in North America, its largest market, increased 5 percent, feeding a newfound confidence among company executives. Shares of Coke rose $1.49 yesterday, to $53.88. 
"The fact of the matter is, cola growth has been reasserted in North America," said Jeffrey Dunn, president of Coke's operations in the United States, in a conference call with analysts and investors. 
To some, Mr. Dunn's declaration was a bit of an overstatement, particularly because Coke's most recent results were buoyed by an Easter holiday that occurred in the first quarter this year. Still, when compared with the inertia in the carbonated-drink industry over the last two years, most analysts viewed the 3 percent increase in Coke's soda sales as refreshing. "The sleepy giant is in the waking," said Andrew Conway of Credit Suisse First Boston. "Is it going at the speed it needs to be going? No. But it's headed in the right direction."
Indeed, the company's confidence grew enough for it to raise its earnings estimate for all of 2002, if only by a penny, after years of guarding against investor disappointment by whittling its own growth targets. With a lower tax rate than previously expected, the company said its earnings estimates should increase to a range of $1.77 to $1.81 a share from a range of $1.76 to $1.80.
Marc Cohen, a Goldman, Sachs analyst, remarked: "It's not a number that causes an earthquake, but it is significant. As far as we remember, this is the first time that the company has guided numbers higher in three years."
It is somewhat unclear why soda consumption, particularly in the United States, seems to be edging out of its slump. But part of the resurgence can be attributed to the soda companies, which have been expanding their carbonated-drink offerings in an effort to lure consumers back to the kinds of drinks that brought them success in the 1990's. 
"The category badly needed some news and excitement," said John Sicher, editor of Beverage Digest, an industry newsletter. "With products like Pepsi's Code Red last year, and now Vanilla Coke this year, it seems to be getting some."

HEADLINE: Factory Output Rises; Oil Costs Worrisome 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 16 

 BODY:
Industrial production posted the biggest gain in nearly two years, the Federal Reserve reported today. But prices crept slightly higher, reflecting a worrisome rise in oil costs, a potential hazard for the young economic recovery.
 The Fed said that output at the nation's factories, mines and utilities rose 0.7 percent in March, after a 0.3 percent gain in February -- a sign that the turnaround in manufacturing is gaining momentum. It was the third consecutive monthly increase and surpassed expectations. 
 Though the economic revival is not causing a run-up in consumer prices, soaring oil costs are a concern. A drastic increase could slow or derail recovery. "Oil prices -- that's the great wild card," said David Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said the Consumer Price Index, a closely watched inflation gauge, rose 0.3 percent in March, after a 0.2 percent advance in February. Analysts had expected a 0.5 percent increase. Virtually all the pickup came from energy prices, which rose 3.8 percent, the biggest increase in 10 months.
Middle East tension was the main force behind the increase. Oil prices retreated last week, then rose on Monday, stoked by political uncertainties in Venezuela, a leading exporter. Today, oil edged up 18 cents further in New York, settling at $24.75.
While many economists think that energy prices will moderate, they acknowledge that soaring energy costs are a potential Achilles' heel for the recovery. "In general, higher oil prices are a bad thing for the economy," said Bill Cheney, chief economist at John Hancock. "They represent a very real cost to the U.S. that feeds through the whole economy." 
Gasoline prices went up 8 percent in March, the largest advance in six months, reflecting higher crude oil costs and greater demand. Fuel oil prices rose 2.2 percent, the biggest increase since December 2000, and natural gas prices rose 0.8 percent.
Food prices were up 0.2 percent for the second consecutive month.
Excluding energy and food prices, the so-called core rate of inflation moderated, rising just 0.1 percent last month, down from a 0.3 percent increase. This suggested that most other prices remained under control.
In the Fed's report, the 0.7 percent increase in industrial output matched the rise registered in May 2000 -- before battered industries fell into a slump. For the first quarter, industrial activity rose at a pace of 2.5 percent, a big improvement over the 6.7 percent rate of decline in the last quarter of 2001.
At factories, production rose 0.8 percent in March, the strongest showing in two years.
As manufacturers pick up steam, home building, which propped up the economy during the slump, is losing somewhat.
Housing construction fell 7.8 percent in March, the largest decline in two years, the Commerce Department said today. Analysts had expected a 3.9 percent decline. Even with the drop, builders began work on 1.65 million units, at an annual pace, a still robust level. While economists predict a slowing, they still expect healthy activity.

HEADLINE: Music Services Aren't Napster, But the Industry Still Cries Foul 

BYLINE:  By MATT RICHTEL 

 BODY:
The record industry's legal victory over Napster last year has neither stopped the trading of free music online nor halted a slide in music sales.
 A new generation of free music exchanges has blossomed in place of Napster, which was forced offline by a California court in July and has yet to return. So the record companies have found themselves back in courtrooms worldwide and are facing a more complicated set of legal questions. 
 The results have been mixed, with record companies applauding a decision reached last week by a Japanese court against a Napsterlike service there, but denouncing one last month in the Netherlands, where a court found that the users, not the music service, were to blame. 
In perhaps the most significant battle, the music and movie industries are in Federal District Court in Los Angeles fighting three services -- Kazaa (whose software is now distributed by Sharman Networks), Grokster and Morpheus, from StreamCast Media -- that can be used to exchange not only music, but also films and other digital media. Tens of thousands of new users download the free software each day. The networks are supported by advertising that they send to users' computers.
Underscoring the industry's woes, a survey released today by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, an international record industry trade group, found that revenue from global music sales fell 5 percent in 2001, to $33.7 billion. The federation attributes the decline, the largest since the mid-1980's, to the global economic slowdown and the copying of music, though it could not provide figures indicating the precise impact of either factor.
Still, Jay Berman, the chief executive of the industry federation, asserted that the sales declines "reflect the fact that the commercial value of music is being widely devalued by mass copying and piracy."
Some industry analysts disagree. Aram Sinnreich, a music industry analyst with Jupiter Communications, said that sales were dropping because of the cyclical nature of the music market. "Very little of it can be ascribed to online music sharing," he said.
Increasingly, these matters are being debated in court.
Last week, in a lawsuit filed by Japanese record companies, the Tokyo District Court issued a ruling against Japan MMO, which operates a free music exchange service called File Rogue. In granting a temporary injunction, the court ruled that Japan MMO must not provide File Rogue's users the option of downloading songs whose copyrights are held by any of the 19 Japanese record companies that filed the lawsuit.
But record companies and their representatives are far less pleased with a recent ruling by a Dutch appellate court. In that ruling, the court found that the people using a music exchange -- in this case, Kazaa -- were the ones violating copyright laws, not the Kazaa service itself.
In the Los Angeles case, scheduled for trial in October, the Recording Industry Association of America, which represents the major record companies, has sued StreamCast Networks, Grokster and Kazaa.
The record companies are hoping to rely on points they established in the Napster case. "They are doing exactly the same thing -- both from a consumer perspective and from a copyright-holder perspective," said Matt Oppenheim, senior vice president for business and legal affairs at the recording industry association.
But the defendants say they must be judged differently from Napster because, they say, the new exchanges have a fundamentally different technological underpinning.
On Napster, users exchanged songs that they kept on their own computers. But to find out what songs were available through the system, they filed a search request that went through Napster's computers.
Users of Morpheus, Grokster or Kazaa software trade music from their own computers, but they also use their own computers to search for the music they want. Specifically, the software looks around the network of users for those with the most powerful computers, turning those computers temporarily into hubs that other users can tap into to search the rest of the network.
Lawyers for the software makers say that once they introduce the software into the market, they not only cannot control how it is used but also cannot completely shut down their systems because those networks do not rely on the companies' computers. 
"The peer-to-peer systems in this case do not have central servers, like Napster," said Judy Jennison, a lawyer for Kazaa. She said that was the major difference in the cases, "drilled down to its finest point."
But the record companies say that the services have far more control than they let on. Lawyers for the music companies point out that the Morpheus system, for example, was taken offline in February for a software change. 
Justin Hughes, a visiting law professor at the University of California at Los Angeles who is an expert in intellectual property and Internet law, said the fact that Kazaa and Streamcast did not have centralized servers made this a more "complicated case."
But in his view, he added, such a system will not cause a court to rule in the online services' favor. "I expect a lot of people in the judiciary will look at this and say, 'This does not meet the smell test,' " he said.

HEADLINE: Independent Considers a Third Run for Governor 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 16 

 BODY:
B. Thomas Golisano, the Rochester billionaire who has twice run for governor as an Independence Party candidate, said today that he was leaning heavily toward running a third time and would make a formal announcement in three weeks.
 Speaking at a fund-raiser in Albany, Mr. Golisano said the only development that could keep him out of the race would be the Independence Party's choosing a strong candidate not affiliated with a major party. A majority of the party's leaders have already decided to throw their line on the ballot to the Republican incumbent, Gov. George E. Pataki. 
 "To turn the nomination over to another major party today would be a huge mistake," he said.
Mr. Golisano, whose personal worth is more than $1.7 billion, said he would challenge Mr. Pataki in a primary for the Independence line if the party nominated the governor. If he lost the primary, he said, he would circulate petitions and run as an independent candidate in the general election. He would need at least 15,000 signatures to do that.
If he ran, Mr. Golisano could hurt Mr. Pataki among upstate conservatives and independents. He attracted about 4 percent of the vote in 1994 and twice that in 1998 with a message of lower taxes, limits on campaign contributions and better schools.
Mr. Pataki has wooed the Independence Party's leaders successfully, promising to support a constitutional amendment allowing citizens to put legislation on the ballot through petition drives. That proposal is critically important to the party rank and file.
"The party's going to nominate George Pataki this year," said Jeffrey E. Graham, a member of the executive committee and a former mayor of Watertown. "It's pretty much a lock."
But Mr. Golisano said he was disappointed in Mr. Pataki's record in helping the upstate economy and lowering taxes.

HEADLINE: Players and Owners Differ Over Balance 

BYLINE:  By Murray Chass 

 BODY:
The last time labor representatives of the owners and the players met, the players proposed a novel approach to the competitive balance problem that the owners say is hurting Major League Baseball. When talks resumed yesterday after a five-week hiatus, the owners didn't reject the proposal; they instead asked questions before preparing their rejection.
 "We did not substantively respond to the proposal other than to ask questions about the rationale for it," Bob DuPuy, baseball's chief operating officer, said. But he left no doubt that the players came up significantly short with their idea of moving players and draft choices around instead of 50 percent of the clubs' local revenue that Commissioner Bud Selig wants to move. 
 "The commissioner," DuPuy said in a telephone interview, "has made it clear there needs to be certain economic benchmarks achieved through bargaining, both in revenue sharing and salary restraint in the form of a competitive balance tax. He hasn't deviated from that. There are additional reforms he feels can help competitive balance, but he views those as enhancements rather than substitutes."
 In their March 13 proposal, the players indicated their willingness to accept a world draft of amateur players the owners want to create, though with some different elements, and they proposed a professional player draft, in which the weakest teams would select players from the strongest teams.
 They also proposed allowing teams to trade draft choices, negotiating rights to drafted players and newly signed draft choices, and they proposed changes in the June amateur draft and the December draft of minor league players, all weighted toward poorer clubs.
 But the players continued to reject a payroll, or competitive-balance, tax and they stuck to their revenue-sharing position, in which they would agree to having clubs share 22 percent of their local revenue, using a different method from Selig's plan that calls for 50 percent to be shared. The commissioner also wants to impose a 50 percent levy on portions of payrolls over $98 million.
 "Our questions today were designed to understand more completely their proposal so we can formulate responses to it," DuPuy said. "It was the start of what I hope will be a long series of working sessions designed to get us closer to a deal."
 Donald Fehr, the union leader, said the union would begin responding to the clubs' questions at today's session.
 The two newest members of the owners' negotiating team attended yesterday's meeting at the commissioner's office in New York. One person who attended the meeting said Peter Angelos, owner of the Baltimore Orioles, and Andy MacPhail, president of the Chicago Cubs, listened but did not speak. Murray Chass

Broad-Based Rally Lifts Shares and Hopes for Recovery

BYLINE:  By SHERRI DAY 

 BODY:
Stocks climbed in a broad-based rally yesterday as several companies including Johnson & Johnson and General Motors reported better-than-expected financial results and reignited investors' hopes that an economic recovery is under way.
 Technology issues led the market's surge as positive forecasts from Novellus and Texas Instruments lifted the semiconductor sector. 
 "We got off to a good start with the Texas Instruments and the Novellus news, so it's making people focus on the recovery again," said John Forelli, senior vice president and portfolio manager at Independence Investment in Boston. "We've had a couple of days where people have been worried about corporate earnings" since General Electric reported weaker-than-expected results on Thursday. 
"The reality is the economy and earnings prospects are improving," he said, "and today is a day where investors are deciding to take advantage of that."
Bolstered by the gains in the technology sector, the Nasdaq composite index jumped 63.01 points, or 3.6 percent, to 1,816.79. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 207.65 points, or 2.1 percent, to 10,301.32. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 25.82 points, or 2.3 percent, to 1,128.37.
The mood could turn, however, if a big company issues disappointing earnings. 
After the market closed, Intel reported first-quarter earnings that were largely in line with Wall Street's expectations, but investors initially reacted enthusiastically.
Excluding acquisition-related charges, the company posted a profit of $936 million, or 14 cents a share. Craig R. Barrett, the chief executive, said that demand in emerging markets remained strong but that weak spending continued to affect established markets like the United States and Europe.
Shares of Intel gained $1.40, to $29.51. Shares rose as high as $31.50 in after-hours trading. 
Shares of Texas Instruments rose $1.66, to $33.79. The company said late Monday that it had "turned the corner toward growth" and expected stronger sales and profits throughout the year, after posting a loss of $38 million, or 2 cents a share, in the first quarter.
Novellus, which also makes semiconductor equipment, gained $3.06, to $53.46, after it reported financial results on Monday that beat Wall Street's expectations and said it expected sales to improve. 
The upbeat forecasts from the two companies spilled over into the entire chip sector. Applied Materials gained $2.72, to $54.16; Linear Technology rose $2.56, to $43.88; and Xilinx picked up $1.37, to $42.56. 
The Philadelphia Stock Exchange's semiconductor index climbed 31.92 points, or 5.6 percent, to 603.54. 
Telecommunications stocks also recorded gains yesterday on the heels of an earnings report from Sprint, which reported earnings of $286 million, or 32 cents a share. Wall Street had expected Sprint, the nation's third-largest long-distance company, to earn 30 cents a share. Shares of Sprint surged $2.79, to $16.26.
Other long-distance companies rose on Sprint's announcement. WorldCom rose $1.16, to $6.23; AT&T gained $1.34, to $14.89; and the MCI Group climbed 83 cents, to $5.58.
Sprint's wireless unit, Sprint PCS, rose $2.58, to $12.60, after it reported a quarterly loss of 15 cents a share. Analysts had predicted that the company would lose 20 cents a share.
Other wireless stocks moved higher as well. Nextel rose $1.48, to $5.95, and Leap Wireless was up $1.02, to $10.68. 
Among the Dow industrials, General Motors gained $2.95, to $64.05. The company reported that its first-quarter earnings excluding special items rose to $791 million, or $1.39 a share, exceeding Wall Street's forecast of $1.14 a share. Company officials said strong sales in North America and cost reductions were largely responsible for the increase.
Johnson & Johnson rose $1.10, to $63.26, after it reported profit of $1.83 billion, or 59 cents a share, compared with $1.55 billion, or 50 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. The company said strong sales growth of drugs that treat anemia, arthritis and schizophrenia were responsible for the increase. --------------------

Treasury Prices Fall (By Reuters)
Treasuries fell yesterday as a surge in stocks prompted dealers to book profits after a two-week government bond rally fueled by increasing prospects the Federal Reserve would be slow to raise interest rates.
Stocks soared as Wall Street cheered higher sales forecasts from an array of top companies.
Data showing industrial output increased sharply in March, drawing funds out of Treasuries into stocks.
The market mostly shrugged off economic data for March showing tame core inflation pressure and a sharp drop in housing starts.
By late in the day, the price of the 10-year note dropped 13/32, to 97 20/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.19 percent from 5.13 percent on Monday.
The 30-year bond fell 17/32, to 96 1/32. Its yield rose to 5.66 percent from 5.62 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of a four-week bill:

Economist Testifies For Microsoft

BYLINE:  By AMY HARMON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 16 

 BODY:
An economist testifying for the Microsoft Corporation told a federal judge today that the company's antitrust violations had not harmed consumers or significantly damaged competition in the market for PC operating systems.
 Kevin M. Murphy, an economist at the University of Chicago, said the court would be justified in imposing only a narrow set of restrictions on Microsoft, given the lack of evidence that the competitive landscape would look any different had the company not acted illegally to preserve its Windows monopoly. 
 "The goal of restoring competition," Dr. Murphy said, "is to restore the prospects for consumer welfare to what would have existed in the but-for world; that is, what those prospects would be but for the anticompetitive acts in question." 
A federal appeals court held last year that Microsoft illegally preserved its monopoly in a series of acts intended to sideline the Netscape Web browser and the Java programming language, which posed a potential threat to Windows.
Dr. Murphy is one of two expert economists scheduled to testify for Microsoft at a hearing on how to restore competition and prevent the company from repeating its unlawful behavior.
Netscape and Java failed to evolve into viable alternatives to Windows almost entirely because of factors unrelated to Microsoft's unlawful acts, Dr. Murphy argued.
Netscape, he said, suffered in part because it continued to charge for its browser after Microsoft released its rival program Internet Explorer free -- a perfectly lawful business practice, according to the appeals court.
Java depended on Netscape to achieve wide distribution on desktop computers, and as Netscape's share of the browser market plunged from 80 percent in 1996 to 15 percent today, Java's chances of success as a Windows challenger eroded, Dr. Murphy said in his written testimony.
Stephen Kuney, a lawyer for nine states that are seeking broad restrictions on Microsoft's business practices, suggested that Dr. Murphy's testimony flew in the face of facts already established by the appeals court. He pointed to several places in the court's decision that described a particular Microsoft act as having a "substantial effect" on protecting the company's market power, which Dr. Murphy described as having only a "small effect" or "virtually no effect" on the future of Netscape and Java.
But Dr. Murphy, who adopted a folksy manner on the witness stand, insisted there was no contradiction. He pointed to language in the appeals court decision indicating that the lower court should consider the degree to which Microsoft's illegal acts actually influenced competition in deciding what sort of penalty to impose on the company.
Much of Dr. Murphy's testimony was aimed at refuting that of Dr. Carl Shapiro, who testified earlier this week as the expert economist for the states. Dr. Shapiro argued that antitrust sanctions should account for the fact that the explosive growth of the Internet had provided a rare opportunity for competitors to challenge Microsoft's monopoly.
Dr. Murphy disagreed, arguing instead that the even wider use of the Internet today allowed for greater threats to Microsoft than when the medium was relatively new. The package of penalties proposed by the states who have dissented from a settlement proposal between Microsoft and the Justice Department, he said, "unduly restricts competition and will harm consumers."
Earlier today, W. Jerry Sanders III, the chairman of Advanced Micro Devices Inc., acknowledged that he had testified against the states' proposals on Microsoft's behalf as a favor to the company's chairman, Bill Gates, even though he had not read them. Mr. Sanders testified that the proposals would hurt the personal computer industry and A.M.D., the second-largest maker of microprocessors after the Intel Corporation. 
On cross-examination, Mr. Sanders acknowledged that after agreeing to Mr. Gates's request in a Feb. 8 telephone call, he sought Microsoft's public support for A.M.D.'s next generation of silicon chips. 
"We were hopeful Microsoft could support A.M.D. as the only remaining viable alternative to an Intel monopoly," Mr. Sanders testified.

HEADLINE: Enron Staff Is Biding Time At a CompanyThat Isn't There 

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARBOZA with JOHN SCHWARTZ 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, April 16 

 BODY:
Despite the turmoil and uncertainty at Enron headquarters here these days, there are executives who can now admit to arriving at the office late each morning and punching out at 5, something unheard-of in the heady days when the company dominated the energy business.
 Senior executives now find time to drive their children to school and leave work early to catch a daughter's soccer game. Calls to Enron employees at 4:45 on a weekday afternoon might find them headed to a high school baseball game in the Bellaire district of Houston. 
 "I see it every day," said Chris Schlaudraff, an administrator who now works part time at Enron because she is educating her three children at home. "Our group is pretty busy, but some areas are relaxed enough to let people go to dance recitals, soccer games, football." 
Bankruptcy and a number of federal investigations have changed everything at the Enron Corporation, which once aspired to be "The World's Leading Company." The sense of urgency is gone.
"It's a different kind of place," said Keith Couch, who works in the information technology division. "Our V.P. has encouraged us to do our jobs but also to take advantage of some quality time outside of work."
Enron is hardly relaxed, of course, as it struggles to survive bankruptcy under Stephen F. Cooper, its acting chief executive, who would like to take it back to its roots as a power and pipeline company.
Enron has 23,000 employees worldwide, down from about 32,000 a year ago. But having shed all its new-economy ambitions to trade everything from natural gas to electronic bandwidth, it is a very different company, one whose future shape is still being determined.
The people who have remained at Enron still receive most of their old salaries, starting at about $150,000 to $200,000 for vice presidents and higher-level executives. But most of a vast legion of energy traders went to UBS Warburg when the trading operation was sold, and there are no more generous bonuses, stock options and other perquisites that often doubled or tripled salaries.
Add in the uncertainty about what tomorrow holds and it is no surprise that working at Enron these days is difficult. While some employees wait for their divisions to be sold or liquidated, others fret about new rules that forbid some departments to discard any documents. Few know if they will be there long enough to see whether Enron will emerge from bankruptcy. Indeed, the company is still regularly laying people off as the need for employees at its headquarters continues to shrink. Few employees hide the fact that they are looking for something else, something better.
"People were told to get a resume ready," said one employee in his 30's who asked not to be identified because of his propensity for searching for jobs online. "Every morning I'm on Monster.com, and no one says anything about it."
To glimpse inside the shimmering 50-story Enron headquarters is to watch a corporation take its last breaths as a colossus. The turnaround specialists, headed by Mr. Cooper, prowl the corridors, doing their best to lift spirits and revive a fallen icon. But the people who have worked here for years know things will never be the same.
The $100 billion company that existed a year ago is all but gone. Though much of its success was an illusion (some experts estimate that the new Enron will generate at most $5 billion in revenue), the people of Enron were the truest of believers.
"It's a totally different place," one midlevel executive said. "It's like sludge compared to the speed-of-light-way things happened before."
From the inside, the headquarters even looks different. About 3,000 employees now work in the glass tower, far from the crush of 6,000 that made for cramped floors and long elevator lines some months ago.
Now, there are deserted floors, vacant offices, rooms stockpiled with unused computers and areas where construction was suddenly halted in December. In some conference rooms, presentation boards are still marked by grand plans that were being hatched on the eve of bankruptcy. The electronic ticker that used to broadcast the company's stock price to insiders has gone dark.
"My friend came into the building the other day," one longtime executive said. "She said, 'How do you go in there every day?' "
Many employees have grown cynical about working at Enron. And who can blame them? Even top executives talk publicly about the bleak mood.
"I don't have any motivation," said one employee, who asked not to be identified for fear she might be dismissed. "I work in the corporate tax department, and no one here is willing to work late. We're just kind of in la-la land right now."
Many here share the pain of former colleagues like the more than 4,000 around the world who were let go on one day in December with little severance pay. But those remaining face the almost daily reminder of hearing about one scandalous disclosure after another. It is as if a scarlet "E" were sewn onto their clothing, some say. 
"This cloud is never going to go away," said one midlevel executive who has worked at Enron for nearly a decade. "It's sort of intangible, but there's that Enron taint. You pick up the papers, and everything that happened here is bad. Everyone has been cast in a bad light; no matter what you did here, it was bad."
To soothe employees, Mr. Cooper has delivered peppy voice mail messages to the staff each week, a mix of straight talk about the prospects for survival and heartfelt encouragement for those willing to stay the course.
"Hi everybody. It's Steve Cooper," one message began. "I just wanted to give you an update as to where we are with the retention and severance plan."
Indeed, Mr. Cooper has tried to be the honest broker who has long been missing from the Enron arcade. Last Thursday, he held his first all-employee meeting at the Hyatt Regency hotel a few blocks away.
He showed up in his trademark attire: a yellow baseball cap, a rumpled jacket, khakis and a golf shirt. Inside, he told a group of about 1,000 employees that he was bullish on Enron's future and that they should be, too.
"This is a Chapter 11, which is a reorganization," he said. "It's not a Chapter 7, which is a liquidation.'
He also paid tribute to those employees who have stuck with the company. "I personally can't imagine how you remain committed to being here," he said. "The last six to nine months must have been hell."
Indeed, many here talk about a restructuring team that is charged with doing what amounts to open-heart surgery on the corporation.
One Wall Street analyst said it had become increasingly difficult to talk to friends on the inside.
"All conversations have ceased," the analyst said. "Their morale has to be somewhere between the 8th and the 12th circle of hell right now."
One bright spot, some employees say, is that television news crews no longer show up each morning. "It's settled down a lot," Mr. Couch of the information technology division said. "Before, we were in a media circus."
Still, employees say that the company feels hollow, that few feel committed to it.
Stephen Schwarz, a former employee in the broadband division, said his friends were just trying to wait out the storm.
"Everybody has that short-timer's kind of attitude," he said. "Ride it out till you find something better." 
So, why do employees stay at a company that is disappearing like the Cheshire cat? Because having survived the corporate equivalent of the Titanic, some feel wedded to Enron; others, happy at least to have a paycheck, use the time to search for a better opportunity.
"There's no future here for the vast majority of people," one high-level executive said. "I don't think about a long-term future at the new company, but I have some time to plot out a new life."
To keep good employees, Enron asked the bankruptcy court to approve a severance and retention package for employees over the next year. In New York today, United States Bankruptcy Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez granted Enron permission to give the bonuses and severance payments to more than 1,700 executives and managers. The bonuses will cost $47.4 million to $140 million, depending on how much is raised at asset sales, Enron said in court papers.
Employees would be eligible for a large retention bonus -- in some cases, maybe $1 million -- if they stayed at least a year. And they would be promised at least $4,500, or two months' salary, in case of dismissal.
"This is the uncertainty of bankruptcy," Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, said recently. "That's why we're working so hard to put together a severance and retention plan, to give people some kind of certainty about their future."
Rather than simply dismantle Enron with a fire sale, Mr. Cooper -- who has helped other corporations, like Polaroid and Federated Department Stores, out of bankruptcy -- says his goal is to create a stable company with pipelines and utilities that span North and South America.
The new Enron would look something like the old, pre-90's Enron, before all the talk about being "asset light" and creating a trading giant that dealt in everything from bandwidth to paper and pulp.
Some old-timers like the idea of the company's returning to its roots. "I don't plan on going anywhere till they run me out," said a 24-year veteran of the pipeline operation.
But most of the troops greet one another like survivors of a terrible battle.
"I get calls every day, 'Sue, I'm so glad you're still here,' " one employee said, masking her true name. "Can you help me?"
Before, she said, the attitude was: Get this done! Now, the requests sound more like: Please get it done, if you can.
"Sometimes, it seems like a ghost town here," the woman said wistfully. In the old days, there was the tendency to look to the future. "Now, people are getting a little nostalgic."

HEADLINE: Cuomo Calls Pataki Record A Failure 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
As his father watched intently from the front row, Andrew M. Cuomo yesterday offered a lacerating attack on George E. Pataki's record as governor, denouncing Mr. Pataki's handling of the upstate economy, the condition of the public school system, and what Mr. Cuomo described as the faltering effort to rebuild the devastated site of the World Trade Center.
 For nearly 30 minutes, as Mr. Cuomo began a three-day tour across New York to formally promote his candidacy for governor that took him from Long Island to Albany yesterday, he repeatedly belittled the man who ousted his father, Mario, from the governor's office in the 1994 election. And he presented a case for why New York voters should now replace Mr. Pataki with another Cuomo in this gubernatorial election. 
 Andrew Cuomo, the former federal housing secretary, described Mr. Pataki's seven years as governor as "a record of failure." He said Mr. Pataki had brought little energy or imagination to the job, and he charged that Mr. Pataki had not fulfilled his bedrock campaign promises of cutting taxes, saying tax cuts would be a central part of his own economic development program. 
Not incidentally, the Democratic gubernatorial candidate sought to deflect Republican efforts to use any lingering animosity that might exist against the father to derail the son as he makes his first attempt for elective office.
"You're going to hear a lot of excuses from George Pataki. He's going to talk about the past," Andrew Cuomo said in a morning speech in Brooklyn, as Mario Cuomo nodded attentively, his expression fixed and sober. "Why? Because he can't defend the present, and he has no vision for the future. That is why it is always about yesterday with George Pataki."
Mr. Cuomo made no direct mention of his opponent in the Democratic primary, H. Carl McCall, focusing his attention entirely on Mr. Pataki, who is seeking a third term and who is, in the view of many politicians, a formidable opponent no matter which Democrat wins the Sept. 10 primary. "It's not that George Pataki is a bad man.," Mr. Cuomo said. "It's just that he's not a good governor, and that is why I'm running for governor of the state of New York."
Mr. Cuomo, 44, portrayed yesterday's speech as his official entry in the race. In fact, there has been no doubt that he was running for office since he stated he was during a speech in New York City nearly 15 months ago; he has been campaigning nearly full-time since then. Aides to Mr. McCall promptly called reporters to denounce the day as an attempt to "revive a flagging campaign."
Nevertheless, whatever its real significance, the day was filled with what have become the trappings of a campaign announcement swing in New York. There was the appearance with Mr. Cuomo's family -- including his wife, Kerry, and three young daughters dressed in matching blue dresses with white trim who frolicked around the stage as Mr. Cuomo spoke. There was the campaign bus to take him across the state. There was even what appeared to be a campaign slogan -- "Ideas. Energy. Action." -- posted on the side of the bus and behind Mr. Cuomo as he spoke.
Most strikingly, though, it was a day about political dynasties and was filled with gentle reminders of the generational handoff that may be taking place in New York this year. 
Mario Cuomo attended his son's main speech, at a homeless shelter in Brooklyn that Andrew Cuomo created when he was running a private nonprofit homeless assistance corporation. The former governor did not speak (Bill Clinton also did not speak when his wife announced her own candidacy) but instead sat quietly in the front row next to his wife, Matilda Cuomo, and Ethel Kennedy, the widow of Robert and the mother of Andrew Cuomo's wife.
Mario Cuomo nodded and applauded as his son's voice filled the room with cadences and turns of phrase familiar to anyone who witnessed the first Cuomo campaign for governor in 1982. Andrew Cuomo, who was his father's campaign manager then, even used the same campaign theme song when he entered the room: the theme from the movie "Rocky."
Afterward, the former governor parried the questions about which Cuomo delivered the better speech with the answer that any father would give about a son who was about to take over the family business.
Aides to Mr. Pataki responded with their own attack, in particular challenging Mr. Cuomo's assertion that taxes have risen while Mr. Pataki has been in office. Lisa Dewald Stoll, the deputy campaign manager, noted that Mr. Cuomo had said total tax collections in New York increased to $44 billion from $34 billion over the last six years.
"We've replaced all the hundreds of thousands of jobs that Mario Cuomo drove out of the state: therefore, more people are paying more taxes, therefore the collective number would go up," she said. "That doesn't mean all these new people aren't having their taxes cut. They are."
She also challenged Mr. Cuomo's assertion that plans to rebuild the World Trade Center site were floundering under Mr. Pataki's leadership. "Ground zero is no place for partisan politics," she said. "I'm not going to comment on those unfortunate remarks."
Mr. Cuomo began his day on the courthouse steps of Nassau County, a reminder of how critical the suburbs will be in this election, before he headed upstate.
Most of his attention was focused on what he said would be the two main issues of the campaign: the upstate economy, a topic that Democratic statewide candidates have been using against Republicans with some success since Charles E. Schumer was elected to the Senate in 1998, and the condition of the state's public school system.
He reiterated his support for eliminating the Board of Education in New York City and putting the mayor in charge, and he said a comparable change should be made with the state system. "Who is responsible for education? The governor of New York. When I'm governor, the buck will stop on my desk."
Mr. Cuomo, who opposes the death penalty, invoked it in discussing how the state should deal with failing schools. "If you want to have a death penalty, let's have a death penalty for failing public schools," he said. "If a school doesn't work, two years and you're out."
On the economy, Andrew Cuomo sounded very much the way Mr. Pataki did in attacking Mario Cuomo eight years ago. "We're never going to be the empire state in terms of economic growth if we are the nation's tax capital," he declared. "We have to get taxes down. We have to lower taxes."
Mr. Cuomo argued that Mr. Pataki had created an illusion of cutting taxes by reducing state taxes and thus state support of local governments, which in turn had to raise property and other local taxes. The result, Mr. Cuomo argued, was that the overall tax load on New Yorkers was higher than ever.

HEADLINE: Senate Energy Bill 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Your April 10 editorial about the Senate energy bill, "The Missing Energy Strategy," reveals how much The New York Times has changed since endorsing responsible oil development on Alaska's coastal plain on three separate occasions in the 1980's. 
 Drastic new fuel economy standards would reduce gasoline use by forcing people into smaller, less safe four-cylinder vehicles. 
These same standards would raise the price of other commodities made from oil, including jet fuel, marine fuel and the feedstocks used to make plastics and other household products. 
Production from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge would occur on 2,000 acres inside a 1.5 million-acre area that the Democratic Senators Henry M. Jackson and Paul E. Tsongas set aside for oil and gas exploration in 1980. 
That parcel abuts the rest of the 19 million-acre refuge, including the eight million acres of federally designated wilderness where environmental radicals take photographs used in newspaper ads against oil exploration on Alaska's coastal plain.

HEADLINE: Fed Is Expected to Hold Steady On Ratesfor Next Few Months 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 16 

 BODY:
With new statistics today providing further evidence that the economy is on the mend and that inflation remains under control, the Federal Reserve now seems likely to hold steady on the interest rates it controls for the next several months, economists said.
 Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, is expected to give investors some guidance about the schedule for any rate increases that may be coming when he testifies on Wednesday before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress. 
 Many Fed officials have indicated in recent weeks that they are not in a rush to raise the central bank's main rate, the federal funds target rate on overnight loans among banks. It is currently 1.75 percent, which is a 40-year low. 
Economic indicators released today appeared to confirm the officials' view that they could afford to be patient. The figures show an economy that is bouncing back from the recession, the first in a decade, without any sustained inflationary pressure other than a recent surge in oil prices. 
Industrial production in March rose 0.7 percent, its biggest gain in nearly two years, indicating that the worst may be over for the hard-hit manufacturing sector. The Consumer Price Index for March rose 0.3 percent, in large part because of the rise in oil prices; excluding food and energy costs, the index rose 0.1 percent.
Fed officials now appear all but certain to leave rates unchanged at their next meeting, on May 7. Investors in the interest rate futures markets are now betting that the Fed will not start tightening its policy until this summer, perhaps as soon as the meeting on June 25-26 but more likely at the session in early August.
Mr. Greenspan faces a choice in coming months, economists said. He can allow the bond market to begin pushing long-term rates higher in coming months in anticipation of a tighter policy from the Fed and a more robust economy, they said. Or he can get out in front of the bond market by raising the Fed's short-term rates to assure investors that he will keep inflation in check and try to keep long-term rates from going so high that the economy stalls again.
"Given that there is no immediate inflation risk, the Fed can afford to lead the market into higher rates gradually," said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, a consulting firm.
"We doubt there will be a rate hike in May," he added, "but we think the market is right to anticipate action in June."
But Fed officials face a particularly unsettled economic outlook, even beyond the usual questions associated with a cyclical rebound from a recession. The road ahead for the Fed could remain full of unexpected twists and turns even as it makes the transition from a period of aggressive rate cuts into what economists expect to be one of gradual rate increases.
The economy could well be subjected to further shocks as the Bush administration pursues its campaign against terrorism, especially if the United States tries to topple Saddam Hussein in Iraq. And the recent volatility in oil prices could slow the recovery. 
At home, the ramifications from Enron's collapse are still rippling through the corporate world. Internationally, the United States faces escalating trade tensions and the drag from Japan's economic paralysis. At its January meeting, the Fed even discussed how it would deal with a Japan-style crisis, in which official interest rates are already near zero but the economy needs more help from monetary policy.
Then there is the growing speculation that the Fed itself faces a significant transition. Mr. Greenspan, who has held his post since 1987, turned 76 last month, and although he has given no indication that he intends to retire anytime soon, there are persistent rumors in Washington and on Wall Street that he will step aside before his current four-year term ends in June 2004.
Whatever his own plans, Mr. Greenspan approaches the crossroads in Fed policy having won generally high marks for his handling of the recession. He continues to be criticized by some economists who say he raised rates too high in 2000 and was too slow to start cutting rates when the economy slowed late that year.
But his aggressive rate cutting -- starting early last year, before the extent of the downturn was clear -- delivered a powerful boost to the economy later in the year. And his willingness to flood the financial system with money after Sept. 11 to help stabilize Wall Street and the banking system helped minimize the economic damage from the terrorist attacks and keep the recession brief and shallow.
"I'd give them an A-minus, and the minus is only because of the inexplicable delay in acknowledging the slowdown in 2000," said John H. Makin, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a research organization. "When Greenspan became convinced they were behind the curve, they got started and moved very quickly in a way that was breathtaking, compared to other central banks. They made aggressive moves all year, and they had the right response to 9/11."
This business cycle largely confirmed Mr. Greenspan's judgment on two issues that will remain important. First, it validated his view that the improvement in the growth rate of productivity, or business efficiency, was more than a flash in the plan. Not only did productivity growth hold up through the downturn, but it accelerated at the end of last year.
Second, last year's experience has seemed to confirm that monetary policy has not lost its punch, a criticism voiced by some economists early in the downturn when the Fed's rate cuts did not seem to be packing much power. Although it took deeper rate cuts than expected to revive the economy -- no one at the beginning of 2001 predicted that the federal funds rate would drop 4.75 percentage points over the course of the year -- the Fed's actions did go a long way toward reviving the economy.
A report this month by Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at Bank of America, said the business cycle over the last year had disproved "the tired mantra that monetary policy had lost its power, that this recession was different and that a long downturn may be in prospect."
Mr. Greenspan did not get everything right. Some economists, for example, said that he had overemphasized the potential harm to the economy from the effect of falling stock prices on the willingness of consumers to spend and that he was slow to pick up on the seriousness of the downturn in business investment.
Not all economists are ready to credit Mr. Greenspan and the Fed with rescuing the economy. Some say growth may soon stall again, now that companies are completing the process of whittling down excess inventories.
"All the good things that happened in the economy after Sept. 11 were either one-shot deals or are likely to run out over time," said James K. Galbraith, an economics professor at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas in Austin.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: LEGISLATION; 
A Move to Release Money To Pay Terrorism Victims

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 16 

 BODY:
Proposed legislation announced today would allow an American victim of state-sponsored terrorism who wins a civil judgment against another country -- Iran, Iraq or Libya, for example -- to collect money from assets of that country that have been frozen in the United States. 
 The measure, sponsored by a bipartisan group of five senators, is opposed by the Bush administration, which contends that the State Department needs to control frozen assets of foreign countries as a diplomatic tool. In fighting the bill, the Bush administration is adopting the same stance as the Clinton administration before it. 
 As a result of the opposition by both administrations, a 1996 law that allows victims to bring suits in American courts has been ineffective, advocates for victims say. 
"Current law allows American citizens to sue terrorist organizations for their losses, but they have been unable to collect, even though the United States Treasury Department lawfully controls at least $3.7 billion in assets of the seven state sponsors of terrorism," said Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, a sponsor of the bill. "Our own government has worked to keep these families from collecting. That's wrong and it needs to be corrected."
Sponsors of the measure are optimistic, noting that Congress has voted twice recently to help one group of victims, the American embassy staff who were held hostage in Iran from 1979 to 1981. A State Department spokeswoman declined to comment on the legislation.
One person with a judgment but no immediate prospect of collecting is Edwina Hegna, whose husband, Charles, was the United States Agency for International Development station chief in Pakistan. Mr. Hegna was on a Kuwaiti airliner that was hijacked in December 1984. He was beaten, and when the plane landed in Teheran, shot three times and dumped under the plane. 
Two days later, when the hijackers saw him move, they shot him three more times, Ms. Hegna said, and then allowed an ambulance to pick him up. He died on the way to the hospital, she said.
Ms. Hegna was awarded $42 million but has been unable to collect from Iran. She was one of several victims whose cases are in various stages who appeared at a news conference today to urge passage. Most said they were pursuing their cases not so much for money as for some measure of justice.
Stewart Dahl, a 22-year Navy veteran, was a petty officer in charge of a detachment of Navy divers when his plane was hijacked by Hezbollah militants and taken to Beirut; all the divers were beaten and one, Robert Dean Stethem, was killed. Their case is still in court here.
"We want to make terrorism costly; that's where it's going to hurt," Mr. Dahl said.
Also at the news conference were several Americans who were held hostage in Teheran after the fall of the Shah of Iran. Last year, they won a judgment against the Islamic Republic of Iran by default, but the State Department stepped in to argue that the agreement it made in 1980 with Iran to free them forbade suits against the Iranian government.
Another sponsor of the measure, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, cited the case of Ira Weinstein, an American who was killed in the 1996 bombing of a bus in Jerusalem, with 23 others. The Hamas militant who detonated the bomb was trained by Iranian security personnel, she said; a judge awarded the family $183 million but it has been unable to collect.
"Crime does not pay," she said, "and neither should terrorism."
In addition to Iran, Iraq and Libya, the measure covers four other countries: Cuba, North Korea, the Sudan and Syria. Senator George F. Allen, a Republican of Virginia, another sponsor, said it was useless to hold on to the money as a negotiating tool when dealing with the "tyrants and despots" in the seven countries.
Iraq has over $2 billion in assets frozen; Libya over $1 billion; Cuba has about $90 million; and Iran about $350 million, plus $60 million in an account for military sales that were never completed, said Gary M. Shiffman, director of governmental affairs at Greenberg Traurig, a law firm. The other countries have minimal assets here, he said.

HEADLINE: Release of Budget Begins a Drama, Familiar, Yet Unscripted 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER and DIANE CARDWELL 

 BODY:
When Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg unveils his executive budget plan today, wrangling with the City Council will begin in earnest. For those involved in city government, it is the high season, the main event -- the time for lobbyists to lobby, advocates to advocate, and the city's executive and legislative branches to get down to some serious trading.
 The $40 billion question this year is how it will all play out with a new mayor and a new City Council trying to close a budget deficit of nearly $5 billion. There could be a reprise of what was likened in years past to a dance, in which the mayor proposed cuts with a wink and the Council restored them. Or Mr. Bloomberg may be able to bend the Council to his will, and get them to pass his plan. Then again, the Council could rise up and pass its own budget, as it did just once before, in 1998. And, of course, there is always the possibility that the two sides will amicably reach a compromise. 
 The mayor and the Council have already staked out wide areas of disagreement. The mayor is against all tax increases except one: an increase of $1.42 per pack for cigarettes, while the Council is pushing for a personal income tax surcharge that would pay for new schools and the restoration of a tax on commuters who work in the city but live elsewhere. But both sides say they expect to be able to negotiate an agreement by June 5, when the City Council is obligated by law to pass the budget.
"I'm confident that we are going to work with the mayor, as is our responsibility, to enact a budget that provides for the future of this city," Gifford Miller, the speaker of the City Council, said earlier this week. "I'm not at all worried about how things are going. I think it would be eerie if we all agreed in April." 
And although Mayor Bloomberg is expected to incorporate very few, if any, of the Council's proposals in his executive budget today, he said yesterday that he would look at some of its ideas, such as a call to sell more taxi medallions. 
The mayor is expected to say that the size of the deficit has grown to more than $4.9 billion, from his old projection of $4.76 billion, officials say. And he continues to prepare his contingency plan: deeper cuts that he would seek if the state and federal governments and the city's labor unions do not take the actions that he says are required to help the city save money. 
The size of the Police Department could drop further under the contingency plan. Officials said yesterday that the plan would call for pushing back the next class at the Police Academy from July until January, saving $63 million by delaying the hiring of 1,300 new officers to replace retiring officers. The backup plan would also scrap the mayor's previous plan to hire 800 civilians at the Police Department to replace officers who work at desks, freeing them for patrol duties. 
All told, officials said, the net effect of the contingency plan would be to reduce the targeted size of the force to 37,790, from the current target of 39,110. The department recently hit a peak strength of 40,710 officers, but it has found it difficult to maintain that size because officers are retiring faster than new cadets are recruited.
For those joining the city budget battles in the middle, here is a brief recap, in terms of a drama in five acts. The scene: the recession and the terrorist attack have driven down tax collections, and city spending has been rising in recent years, leaving New York with a $4 billion to $5 billion shortfall in the fiscal year that begins on July 1.
Act I came in February, when Mayor Bloomberg released a preliminary budget that called for closing the gap with $1.8 billion in cuts and savings at most agencies, including the Police and Fire Departments and the schools; $1.5 billion in borrowing, which he said was undesirable but necessary; and $1.3 billion in savings that would require action by the state and federal governments and the city's labor unions. His plan called for closing seven centers for the elderly, ending the recycling of bottles and cans, avoiding layoffs and raising only the cigarette tax.
Act II came earlier this month, when the City Council released its response to the mayor's budget. The Council called for restoring the cuts to education, keeping the recycling program and restoring services for the elderly. It proposed a surcharge on the personal income tax that would generate $400 million a year to build new schools, and called on the State Legislature to reinstate the commuter tax. The mayor responded that he opposed higher taxes, saying they drove away business. He added that it was unrealistic to expect Albany to approve higher taxes in an election year. 
Act III opens today, with Mr. Bloomberg's executive budget. Then comes Act IV: hearings, negotiations, protests. Act V, the grand finale, comes in June when, somehow, the City Council passes a budget for fiscal year 2003.
But no one is quite sure how the final acts will play out. Current and former officials and political analysts are still taking the measure of the new mayor and his administration. Many wonder how unified the new City Council is, and whether Mr. Miller, its speaker, will be able to negotiate on behalf of the whole body, as his predecessor, Peter F. Vallone, once did. With so many new officials and staff members, lobbyists find themselves unsure of whom to lobby.
For many years, budget negotiations in New York resembled a game, or a tug of war, or perhaps a stylized dance. Most years, the mayor proposed a series of budget cuts to social services, libraries and cultural institutions, and then the City Council restored them, leaving much of the mayor's plan alone, and claiming victory.
But with the city facing a giant budget gap, both sides agree that this year will be different from the games of the past. "We're not going to find that there are pockets of money hidden, where the City Council and the mayor play a game of one cuts and the other restores," Mr. Bloomberg said recently. "There isn't any money to restore."
Within the City Council, the question is how to push its agenda. So far, its signature issues have been calls to restore aid to education and the elderly, to save the recycling program, and to restore cuts to libraries and cultural institutions. Many of the Council's own proposals require state approval, which could be difficult to get, especially without the support of the mayor. The Council did not propose raising the one tax that it has control over, the property tax. So, if the budget is to be negotiated, the Council must set its priorities.
The alternative is that the Council passes its own budget. That happened in 1998, when Mr. Vallone, who was running for governor, and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani got into a heated battle over which taxes to cut, and whether the city should finance a new stadium for the Yankees. It grew into an all-out fiscal war: the Council passed its own budget, the mayor vetoed some items, the Council overrode the vetoes and the mayor refused to spend some of the money. The battle lasted nearly five months, until Mr. Vallone and Mr. Giuliani smoothed over their differences. 
It appears right now that the Council leadership wants to negotiate a solution. David Weprin, a Queens councilman who is the chairman of the Finance Committee, said yesterday that despite some early indications that some members wanted the Council to pass its own budget, there was now a strong consensus to reach an agreement with the administration. "I think a lot of people realize it's not a question of our proposal or his proposal," he said of the shift. 
But some council members have been taken aback by what they say are a series of slights from the mayor in recent days. Two council members who criticized the mayor said they had been barred from meeting with commissioners. Then Newsweek quoted the mayor as suggesting that the Council was not smart and did not understand the budget. 
Several council members said that rejecting the mayor's budget and passing their own was still a live option. "The Council clearly has the authority and the wherewithal to pass its own budget, and may have to undertake that strategy," said Councilman Bill Perkins, a Harlem Democrat. "The mayor will be the one to determine that, depending on how he negotiates."

HEADLINE: Bush and Daschle Set Terms For Their Battle on Budget 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER and ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 16 

 BODY:
President Bush and the Senate majority leader, Tom Daschle, today staked out the battle over taxes, the budget and national defense that will probably define this year's Congressional elections. 
 Mr. Bush threatened to veto any spending that he thinks threatens the war on terrorism, and Mr. Daschle vowed never to allow a Senate vote that would make Mr. Bush's tax cuts permanent. 
 In a speech at the White House that sought to tie his budget to the nation's battle against terrorists, Mr. Bush invoked the lessons of Vietnam -- not the military battles but the budgetary lessons it left. 
"We must not repeat the mistakes in the 60's," he said, "when increased spending required by war was not balanced by slower spending in the rest of government." But he stopped short of declaring that Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society program was a mistake, or suggesting that some of its provisions now be trimmed back.
Mr. Bush also hinted broadly that he had salted away money in the budget for a confrontation with Iraq and other countries accumulating weapons of mass destruction.
"I've got one country in mind," he said to nervous laughter in a brief speech to a group of business leaders calling themselves the Fiscal Responsibility Coalition. 
Raising the possibility that Iraq might seek to "team up with an al Qaeda organization," Mr. Bush said, "It's just not going to happen," and added "our budget reflects that." That was an apparent reference to the administration's budget request for a $10 billion military-action reserve fund that the president could draw on in case of an armed conflict.
Democrats have been enormously cautious about directly confronting the president on any spending for American troops or homeland defense. But Mr. Daschle today pointed out that the while the president was sharply increasing such defense spending, he was not making the same investment in domestic programs.
"We are also cutting taxes unlike anytime we have ever done since the early 1980's," Mr. Daschle said.
Those cuts expire in 2010, unless Congress acts to extend them, which Mr. Bush has urged it to do. Today Mr. Daschle vowed that Democrats would "never bring up the permanent tax cut the president has advocated."
"It is bad policy, it is wrong, and it compounds the budget disaster that our country currently faces," he said.
While it is early in the budget battles, both sides today seemed to be taking positions that could prove painful in the fall. Mr. Bush is likely to get all he asks for in defense, but the result may be that he must choose -- just before the elections -- between vetoing politically popular social spending programs or increasing the projected deficit. Mr. Bush said today that he now believed that deficit spending would end in 2004, but that estimate is based on projections that the American economy will strongly rebound.
Mr. Daschle is also playing with political fire: By refusing to bring to a vote proposals to make the tax cut permanent, he will be accused by Mr. Bush of favoring a tax increase. The president has already struck that chord many times in fund-raising speeches.
Mr. Daschle's declaration today was his strongest yet in response to Republican efforts to make the tax cut permanent.
The Republican-run House is planning to move this week to make the tax cut permanent and use the measure as an election-year campaign issue against the Democrats. The Democrats are saying in turn that the permanent extension of the tax cut risks the health of the Social Security system. 
"Keep in mind, every single dollar of this tax cut will be taken from the Social Security trust fund," Mr. Daschle told reporters after the weekly meeting of the Senate's party caucuses. 
The fight over the tax cut is part of a broader battle of competing agendas. Republicans today were once again accusing Mr. Daschle of being an obstructionist because he has blocked parts of Mr. Bush's agenda.
Mr. Daschle responded: "We're actually proud of the fact that we've stopped some bad legislation from becoming bad law. We stopped Enron from getting a $254 million bailout last fall." He was referring to tax cuts for corporations included in the Republican economic stimulus bill.
"We are going to stop ANWAR," he said, referring to the proposal for oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
"We feel good about some of the things we've stopped," Mr. Daschle said, "because that's why we are here. We are the brakes to the administration at times when brakes are needed."
Mr. Bush's veto threat today was vague, but it was significant because it was the most direct he has uttered. "We don't have to get into needless partisan screeching over the budget," he said. "We've got to have some goals, and I've set the goals in terms of the war, and set the goals in terms of the homeland," he said, adding later, "and I've got a tool, and that's called a veto."
Mr. Daschle appeared unbowed by President Bush's threat.
"I think he needs to clarify what he is talking about," the senator said. "He is actually committed to spending at levels equal to, if not in excess, to anything we've seen in recent times. But mostly that spending has been in defense and homeland and security. 
"If he is keeping spending in check, I think it's only in those areas affecting education and health care and those issues directly affecting the people of this country and ways with which to ensure their strength and their ability to become citizens of this country in a way that give them the jobs and the future that they all want."

HEADLINE: NEW YORK/MILAN; 
Designers Turn Down The Volume

BYLINE:  By JOHN LELAND 

 BODY:
THE 30th annual Kips Bay Decorator Show House, which opens to the public on Tuesday, is intended to represent the state of the art in home decor. This year's show house is an 1871 limestone town house at 18 East 74th Street. All proceeds from the tickets (and a fifth-floor boutique) benefit the Kips Bay Boys and Girls Club in the Bronx. If you like what you see, the building is for sale. The asking price is $12.5 million. 
 Sixteen New York-area professionals, chosen in a competition, had 16 rooms to show off their best. For the sake of comparison, and to see how late-model home design is faring against the Great Escapists in Detroit, I added a 17th interior: a 2002 Cadillac Escalade sport utility vehicle. Car interiors have become increasingly homelike, adding luxe materials, elaborate entertainment systems and enough lounging room for a small cocktail party. 
 At the same time, home designers have resisted the ergonomic innovations of cars, like adjustable lumbar supports in sofa seats or split thermostats to cool one side of a bedroom without freezing the body on the other side. (The exception is the kitchen, for what is a Viking stove but a hot-rod engine with burners instead of wheels?) 
For a weekend, I bounced between the show house, a borrowed Escalade and my own not-ready-for-prime-time apartment. I sat in chairs, kicked tires and boomed the stereo. Let the games begin. 
Compared to past show houses, which have run to glorious excess, this year's rooms were quiet and restrained, short on big ideas and chintz, but long on soothe. Though several of the rooms would cost more than $1 million to replicate (the decorators get many of the furnishings and materials free in exchange for a mention in the program), there was little flaunting of wealth. "There's not so much glitter, glitz, gilding, over-the-top kind of things," said Harry Hinson, the event's honorary chairman, who has been involved with the show house for 30 years. 
Materials pulled back from conspicuous luxury. Gold and gold flake were almost absent, and the flashy electronics and giant plasma televisions that showed up in several rooms in past years, courtesy of a former sponsor, Philips, made only occasional cameos. Instead there were books on shelves and items from the designers' personal collections. Bright sorbet colors -- orange, turquoise, strawberry, lime, pale blue -- cast a warm glow over unpretentious and tasteful rooms. 
"I believe people want their homes to feel like a sanctuary or retreat," said Celeste Cooper, creative director of the design store Repertoire, who created a serene sitting room in off-whites and creams. Ms. Cooper's room was modernist with few sharp edges: club chairs in woven cotton, rayon, linen and goat-hair herringbone; a milky plexiglass mantle surrounding a marble flame; cool polished nickel coffee tables. All rested under a painted light box from Pucci that bathed everything in the color of flan. A marble bench by the artist Jenny Holzer, with the inscription, "You saw a way to survive and you were full of joy," threatened to push the mood past sanctuary toward final resting place.
Several decorators spoke about the restrained climate in response to Sept. 11 and the recession. "This room is about anonymity," Ms. Cooper said. "It's not about pedigree or provenance. The fabrics are luscious without being ostentatious. I think that's the zeitgeist."
Newcomers provided much of the energy. Katie Ridder, in her first year at Kips Bay, designed a small fourth-floor guest room in soft taupes and greens, creating a leafy retreat. She stenciled the walls in a white leaf pattern and designed a daybed with a back shaped like maple leaves. In a show house that was largely off-the-rack or out-of-the-atelier, this was an inspired bit of custom whimsy.
Ms. Ridder tried to do the room on what passes around here for a budget, reflecting a year in which some of her big-spender clients had either put off work or pulled back, replacing, say, an expensive Stark carpet with a cheaper sisal. The room would cost about $35,000 -- "but you could do it for $15,000 to $20,000 if you cut back on the materials," she said. 
T. Keller Donovan likewise trimmed the budget in his plum-and-white media room, done with a Miami theme. Amid more expensive items, like throw pillows in a custom fabric or a clever white butler's table with lots of storage, Mr. Donovan showed hanging shelves from Pottery Barn and a white shelf clock from Ikea. The Escalade, by contrast, was a showpiece of conspicuous consumption. Celebrated in songs like Missy Elliott's "Lick Shots," it is the S.U.V. of choice among rappers, N.B.A. players and other connoisseurs of the oversize ride. Unlike the show house rooms, the Cadillac aims to reflect the taste of its drivers more than its decorator, and that taste, like the stereo, runs to loud. The model I drove, including heated leather seats, power sunroof and an 11-speaker audio system, retails for $54,525, plus tax. 
Yet the Escalade design reflected a level of attention and accommodation toward its occupants that was missing at the show house. The S.U.V.'s seats adjusted every which way, with lumbar supports that both pushed and hugged my lower back, taking the cramps out of a long drive up the Hudson. Though they were not as seductive as the pristine white club chairs with cocoa leather piping in Michael Rosenberg and Leonard Kowalski's sixth-floor study in the show house, they were easier on the spine. 
This study, I should add, was one of the most successful rooms: soothing, uncluttered without being austere, with sea-green Ultrasuede draperies on the windows. This was their first time at the show house. 
Like many of the decorators, Mr. Rosenberg and Mr. Kowalski played stylistic Cuisinart, mixing Asian accessories with modernist lamps, a classic upholstered bench and carved mahogany demi-lune consoles. The effect was both impure and tranquil; it was balanced.
White linen mesh screens gave the room a diffuse glow. The subtle tan plaid wallpaper, by Art People Wall Coverings, created the effect of being in a well-lined drawer. 
After all that contemplative serenity, Jamie Drake's bright-orange third-floor landing added an infectious splash of clamor. "It's my kumquat smoothie," he said, seated at a blinding neo-Victorian sunflower-yellow sofa and surrounded by curved bright orange padded walls. Mr. Drake, also a newcomer here, made headlines recently as the decorator for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, but if this landing was meant to reflect the new austerity of city hall, it overshot by several kilowatts. 
A self-portrait by Chuck Close stared intensely over the area, above twin benches in yellow lacquer that Mr. Drake used as coffee tables. He aimed for uplift rather than cool coddle. Even the jelly beans were orange. "I wanted to be upbeat and optimistic," Mr. Drake said. "I don't want to see anything depressing or dreary."
Mr. Drake, whose room is so extroverted, would not say what kind of car he drove. "That's getting too personal," he said.
Elsewhere, what was most striking about the house was what it lacked: no formal dining room, no decorator bath, no real living room. Instead there were studies, sitting rooms, drawing rooms and retreats -- modest, functional rooms for a year that called for modest statements and scaled-back ambitions. There were many sunburst mirrors, few grand arguments.
"We're moving away from the grand references and the celebrity of the decorator," said Greg Richardson, who worked on Albert Hadley's casually perfect sitting room. "It's more like being a psychiatrist, listening to what the client wants instead of telling them your vision."
As the show house rooms slouch toward sanctuary, they begin to function like the protective lozenge of an automobile. Do not expect to see cup holders in the living room just yet, but this year's house made this move for the most part in quiet good taste and an aura of comfort. Still pending is a concerted effort by furniture designers, outside the homely chairs of the home office, to deliver that comfort, high style and support to the spine. On Jamie Drake's sculptured sofa, I kept reaching for the four-way lumbar button, alas, to no avail.

The Kips Bay Decorator Show House is at 18 East 74th Street. Admission is $20. The house will be open Tuesday through May 19. Information: (212) 988-6991.

HEADLINE: ONLINE SHOPPER; 
And You Thought Eloise Was Fussy

BYLINE:  By Michelle Slatalla; E-mail: Slatalla@nytimes.com

 BODY:
MY most important preparation before traveling with children is to lie to myself.
 I love to travel with children. 
 (See how easy that was?)
I love to hear car-trip debates over whether we should listen to the first cassette tape from the second Harry Potter book for the third time before turning to the fourth book, which we already have heard five times. 
I love to discover, upon check-in, that we forgot to pack the stinky, shredded old rag known as Night-Night Blanket that my 4-year-old needs to fall asleep. 
Lies, lies, lies. Achieving that remarkable level of self-delusion would not be possible without some tiny basis in fact. So I am very, very picky when it comes to choosing a hotel. It must fit the image I conjure of The Check-In, a mental scene in which we tumble cheerfully from the car while the girls chatter (for some reason, in civil, quasi-British accents), "Why, Mummy, perhaps you should take a hot bath with the complimentary bath salts while we unpack."
My standards rival those of Eloise of the Plaza. That's why I never was able to complete a reservation online at any of the usual travel haunts, like Expedia.com, Travelocity.com and Orbitz, where I go for maps or airline tickets. Although I've been clicking on nonrefundable airline tickets for years, even the most tempting room rate raises questions I can only answer with follow-up phone calls to pester hotel clerks: What do you mean by "club room"? Is "pool" an indoor facility? Do the "bath amenities packs" include loofahs?
But last week, as I planned a weekend excursion with my three daughters to Cambridge, Mass., I figured it would make things easier if I just went online to a travel site, clicked on an available room, paid by credit card and printed out the confirmation number.
I started the search at Expedia (because I agree with Forrester Research's recent assessment that it is the most navigable of the major travel sites). My criteria were specific: I wanted a two-bed, nonsmoking room within easy walking distance of Harvard Square (to avoid having to get back into the car until it was time to go home).
Using an Expedia map that showed street locations, I narrowed the candidates to three: the Charles Hotel (intriguing, also, was the mention of a pool), the Inn at Harvard and the Sheraton Commander.
All sounded nice, but there were two problems: they were pricy (with rates from about $160 to more than $200 a night) and only the most expensive, the Sheraton Commander, was available for both nights.
I reserved the Sheraton Commander for $229 a night, figuring that if something better turned up later I could cancel without penalty since the Sheraton was not an Expedia Special Rate hotel (be warned: Suzi LeVine, an Expedia spokeswoman, said that canceling Special Rate hotels, a category that offers guaranteed low rates, will cost $25).
But I couldn't resist calling all three hotels, which is how I learned that the Charles Hotel also had a room available for $229 that had not been listed on Expedia. Under my relentless questioning ("How big is this pool?" "Indoor?" "Are fluffy towels available?"), the reservations clerk said that the pool actually belonged to a health club; hotel guests could only use it during limited hours. That's the kind of detail I would have been really irritated to learn after checking in.
Next I visited Farechase.com, a search site that looks for cheap rates listed on hotel chain sites, travel sites and hotel consolidator sites. The results listed only one hotel in Cambridge, the Holiday Inn Express Suites, for $339.90 a night. Among the dozens of results for Boston that I scrolled through, I also found the Salem, N.H., Holiday Inn ($158) and the Providence Airport Hotel in Rhode Island ($212). From either of those it would be a long walk to Harvard Square.
A search at other major sites, including Orbitz, Travelocity and Hoteldiscount.com, confirmed that rooms were scarce in the Boston area last weekend as visitors prepared to swarm into town for the Boston Marathon on Monday.
That night I tossed and turned over the high price of the Sheraton Commander. Maybe it was time to take a chance on a cheap room through Priceline.com, a site I always have avoided because you have to bid for a room without knowing which hotel the site might select for you (and an accepted bid is nonrefundable, even if you are not happy with the selection).
Two impulses were at war: my desire to micromanage my location and an equally strong desire to save money.
Cheapness won, at least temporarily, because the next morning I visited Priceline, where I learned I could narrow my geographic search only to the entire city of Cambridge, an area that according to the site's map extends approximately three miles.
A three-mile area was still a big gamble. On the other hand, what if I bid $70 and Priceline assigned me to the Sheraton Commander?
To remove some mystery from the blind bidding process, I visited BiddingForTravel.com, where Priceline bidders post messages describing their experiences. There I gleaned valuable intelligence about at least one Cambridge hotel that sells rooms over Priceline, from a post that described a successful $70 bid for a room at the University Park Hotel at M.I.T. I checked the map. Too far to walk.
By now it was Wednesday. I checked Expedia again and was shocked to see a Sheraton Commander rate of $189, $40 less than the rate posted two days earlier. I booked the lower rate. Minutes later it no longer was available.
"This feels like hotel roulette," I told Ms. LeVine of Expedia. "Why?"
"Usually hotel rates don't change like that," she said. "Unlike airfare, hotels don't have a predictable pattern for when they might open up new rates. But there may be a lot of strangeness in the system because of the Boston Marathon."
By then I figured I had a pretty good deal. But on a hunch, I checked the Sheraton Commander's own site again and saw the $189 rate available on an upgraded club room. Yes, I phoned and learned that a club room came with complimentary continental breakfast and "upgraded bath amenities."
"You mean lotions?" I asked. 
"Right," the clerk said. 
So I booked the club room directly through the hotel, canceled the Expedia reservation for the lesser-lotions-room and started to pack. My 11-year-old asked, "Will we be allowed to order room service?" 
"No," I said. 
"I love to travel with adults," she said.

HEADLINE: The Beige Box Fades to Black 

BYLINE:  By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
THE beige-box personal computer, the drab diehard of modern industrial design, became a visual standard without a lot of deep thought in 1981, when I.B.M. introduced its PC. It was functional, neutral, almost non-design, says Lee Green, the company's current director of design. Yet beige box it was, and bland proliferated for two decades, long after "it was obvious they were beyond boring," Mr. Green said. 
 Even earlier, the Apple II in 1977 was mostly beige, and the first cuddly Macintosh in 1984 was beige, though it was no conventional box. Irrefutably, however, it was I.B.M. that brought the personal computer into the mainstream, and the industry -- except for Apple -- followed its lead in industrial design, or the lack of it. The companies that rose in I.B.M.'s wake -- Compaq, Dell, Gateway and others -- were aptly termed clones. 
 But now the beige-box desktop PC seems headed toward extinction at last. The changeover has evolved gradually, along with the ways people think about their computers, but the pace is quickening as more and more PC makers abandon beige. 
Dell has moved from beige to black for all of its desktop machines. Hewlett-Packard had shifted to shades of gray by 1997 and has since settled on silver and dark gray. I.B.M. introduced its first black desktop PC in 1996 and completed its move to black in 2000. Last month Compaq announced that it was converting its consumer desktop PC's from beige, with some color panels, to black-and-silver designs. Next week, Gateway plans to introduce a series of desktop models with a non-beige color scheme. A safe bet: it will be dark gray or black. 
Beige desktops may be headed for the design dustbin, following the lead of notebook computers years ago, but dark gray and black are the new conformity. It scarcely qualifies as a deep insight that things often look better in black, thinking back at least to Coco Chanel's original little black dress of 1926, if not before. 
PC designers say that as black attire has became more commonplace beyond New York and Los Angeles, it has made black acceptable for mainstream PC's. Until recently, the designers say, market research had shown that many people regarded black as polarizing and extreme. 
Black is certainly an improvement over beige. Perhaps the shift is just the caboose in a trend of computers' following fashion. 
"The death of the beige box is really the tip of the iceberg," said Paul Saffo, a director at the Institute for the Future in Menlo Park, Calif., and a student of computer design. "Computers of all kinds -- desktops, notebooks, hand-helds, MP3 players and cellphones -- are embedding themselves deeper and deeper into our lives, and one of the things they have to do is dress better."
Manufacturers have come to realize that given the relentless pressure on PC prices, color and design might be a way to get noticed in a tough market. Besides, ignoring appearances could spell trouble when a rival has decided that design matters.
Sony entered the PC business with a consumer electronics mindset, adopting a purple-and-gray palette for its Vaio models. But the real innovator in computer design and the use of color has been Apple since Steven P. Jobs returned to the company in 1997. First came the one-piece iMac, introduced in 1998 in a translucent blue and white and released later in a selection of fruit colors. The rest of the industry derided the iMacs as "Life-Savers," but then several companies ineptly tried to echo Apple's design, mostly by slapping colored panels onto conventional desktop machines. 
That trend already seems spent. But this year Apple introduced another striking iMac desktop design: a flat-panel screen on a hinged silver strut connected to a white dome that houses the computer's processor and storage. Jonathan Ive, the company's director of design, minces no words in explaining why Macs look so different from other personal computers. "This industry generally has been creatively bankrupt," he said. 
For Mr. Ive and Mr. Jobs, that position is both a heartfelt belief and a marketing tactic. Not only design but also technology sets Apple apart from the rest of the industry, with its Macintosh operating system and Power PC microprocessor offering ramparts against the onslaught of Microsoft's Windows and Intel's microchip, known as Wintel. A recent Apple advertisement read: "If you're an accountant, you're most likely surrounded by beige Wintel boxes. But if you work in nearly every creative field, you most likely use a Mac." 
Industrial designers at other computer companies admire Apple's work. Yet they insist that its rarefied approach is a luxury that Apple can afford only because it is a niche company accounting for less than 5 percent of worldwide PC sales. 
In computing, the term "standard" is typically applied to a technology, in software or hardware. Those standards, particularly Intel's microchip, have become grist for economists and antitrust lawyers, who explain the dominance of such technologies with sophisticated language like "network effects," "path dependencies" and "increasing returns markets." 
Explaining an industrial design standard is more subjective. But the persistence of the beige-box PC standard, and its eventual decline, has its own logic of economics, habit and fashion. Beige PC's arrived in offices in the 1980's, when the management fashion was to scorn hierarchy and extol the virtues of teamwork and a more egalitarian workplace. Japan's teamlike corporate organizations appeared to be winning the economic footrace. Some Silicon Valley companies had abandoned private offices in favor of cubicles with shoulder-high beige partitions.
So beige PC's fit in. No matter that time and common sense would make such gestures toward democracy in the workplace the stuff of Dilbertesque satire. The beige-box PC was well entrenched and difficult to displace, if often bemoaned. Most PC's were used in business, and purchasing managers wanted office equipment to be standardized to reduce costs and limit employee complaints. "In business, they don't want the new thing looking different than the old thing," said Mike Stinson, a Gateway vice president. 
PC makers are mainly packagers of disk drives, chips and other parts from outside suppliers. Beige was the unshakable standard for the East Asian suppliers of "drive modules" for floppy disks, CD-ROM's and Zip drives. It was only in the last few years, said Steve Gluskoter, director of industrial design for Dell, that the company's market share was large enough that it would not have to pay a higher price for black housings on the drive modules. 
The most important force in the demise of beige has been a gradual shift among users toward perceiving these machines as personal computers. Well into the 1990's, according to marketing and focus-group research conducted by PC makers, most people still regarded a personal computer as another piece of office equipment, like a water cooler or a wastebasket. "It was not something people related their personality to," said Randall Martin, a designer at Compaq. 
The shift began with laptop and notebook computers, which people carried around with them and took home, even if a company bought them. Notebooks abandoned beige first, in part because the beige yellowed and became dirty with fingerprints. But the notebook crowd also preferred other colors. Home desktop users "want to get away from beige because it is associated with work," said Tom Anderson, a PC marketing executive at Hewlett-Packard. 
David Kelley, the founder of Ideo, recalled that his industrial design firm had created some colorful computers over the years, including sculptured purple-and-gray models for Silicon Graphics. "But it didn't make a difference," he said. "People weren't ready yet to consider it a personal thing." 
"But that is what is changing now," added Mr. Kelley, who is a professor at Stanford University. "As the computer moves into the personal space, then these subjective things like color and design begin to matter."

Historical Colors
Tying an Early PC To a Big Blue Star
When I.B.M. famously turned its attention to personal computers two decades ago, beige was not the only choice for a color scheme. 
The Altair, acknowledged as the first commercial personal computer, was blue. It was built in 1975 by a small company in Albuquerque, Micro Instrumentation Telemetry Systems, known as MITS. 
 Microsoft got its start at MITS, where Microsoft's co-founder, Paul Allen, was the director of software and his colleague Bill Gates was briefly a contract worker. 
Ed Roberts, former president of MITS and the father of the personal computer, said that the company chose blue because of the blue mainframe computers used by I.B.M., as if to suggest that the inexpensive, general-purpose Altair microcomputer was also a real computer. On a corner shelf in his office in Cochran, Ga., where he is now Dr. Roberts, a physician, rests an Altair 8800, a shade or two darker than a robin's egg. 
In the heyday of the mainframe, many engineers say, I.B.M. paid too much attention to marketing concerns like color and shape. The technical headaches created by I.B.M.'s machines -- which would be addressed by engineers, not business managers -- tended to be masked by a classy powder-blue exterior. The color -- starting with the 1401 system, introduced in 1959 -- earned I.B.M. the nickname Big Blue. Steve Lohr

HEADLINE: Form Follows Feeling 

BYLINE:  By JULIE V. IOVINE 

DATELINE: MILAN 

 BODY:
A RELENTLESS downpour last week set the mood for the Milan furniture fair, normally a giddy weeklong designfest that drapes this charmless industrial city in wall-to-wall design happenings.
 The galleries in palazzo courtyards and the slick installations in Boeing-size warehouses were clogged as usual with camera-ready displays of high-concept furnishings. But everywhere, as palpable as the rain dripping off the ubiquitous wisteria buds, was a sense of unrealized potential. 
 "It's all very stylish, very functional," said Ayse Birsel, a New York industrial designer. "The big companies are going for what they know will be successful. But I want to see design with more heart." 
The business of buying and selling modern furniture (with its rounded edges, Pantone-bright shades and layered laminates inspired by midcentury modern) has been disappointing, following three boom years. Italian furniture exports slipped 5.3 percent last fall, but ended the year slightly up at $5.8 million in export sales.
The mood at the fair was subdued. Wallpaper magazine and Droog, the Dutch design collaborative, which usually give two of the most raucous be-there bashes, issued no party invitations. "It got to be too many students drinking and damaging the prototypes," a Droog spokeswoman said.
Amid talk that Cappellini, famously devoted to upstart design, was negotiating a sale to the posh B&B Italia, Cappellini staged a baldly sensational display featuring male and female beauties in Pucci-patterned bikinis cavorting on matching Pucci-upholstered benches. The Italian paparazzi went wild, but visitors saw through the gimmick and noticed the absence of striking new designs. (A spokeswoman at B&B Italia did not return phone calls to comment on the potential deal.)
There were proficient designs from the usual suspects. For Kartell, Philippe Starck updated the phenomenally successful clear plastic Marie chair as the ghost of a Louis XV side chair. Anyone who wanted to sample Karim Rashid's hot-dogging beanbag sofa for Edra had to put on special booties to protect its upholstery. One observer called him "the Spice Girl of design."
Richard Garofalo, the owner of Repertoire, which has contemporary furniture stores in Boston and New York, has been scoping out new buys in Milan for the last 15 years. He said it was a year to consolidate, not to expand his collection. A buyer from the Midwest added that he would be cutting back his shopping list. "How many Cappellini chairs can Kansas City buy anyway?" he said.
Lackluster performances by the expected stars made the rare standouts all the more dazzling. In a concrete shed far from the fashionable shopping streets around Via Montenapoleone, Swarovski crystal chandeliers reinvented by young British and Dutch designers evoked smiles and gasps of appreciation. Hella Jongerius, a designer from Rotterdam known for coupling the artisanal and the industrial, made a ball-gown-shaped chandelier with a "bodice" of crystals and a skirt of patterned pink rubber letters spelling out epigrams like, "Can I only update?"
It was a relief from the ordinary, said Murray Moss of the Manhattan store Moss, who will be exhibiting the chandelier in May. "I thought that this year people would clutch onto practicality," he said. "It was nice to see the opposite happening."
Nigel Coates, a British designer, combined the silhouette of traditional swagged candelabra rendered in blue plastic with quivering crystals strung on a computer-generated grid of nylon thread, for kitsch-free glamour. "I wanted there to be some poetry," Mr. Coates said. "Design shouldn't always be as digestible as a car or a washing machine. Common sense is overrated."
The chandeliers were commissioned by Nadja Swarovski, an heir to the 107-year-old Swarovski company in Austria, makers of crystals for the world's shiniest chandeliers. 
The poignant lyricism of the chandeliers touched a nerve in those who feel that much of today's design is missing emotional weight. "I've had enough of rounded edges, orange upholstery and wood laminates," said Michael Maharem of the Maharem textile company in New York.
Visitors reacted in the same spirit to Boa, designed by the Campana brothers for Edra, a sofa made from about 300 feet of tree-trunk-thick ropes entwined in a pile. The massive apple-green velvet piece acted like a magnet for enervated visitors, who dropped like cluster flies onto the velvet coils. They wiggled into position, readjusting the thick loops into neck and arm rests. Humberto and Fernando Campana, magic realists from Brazil, imagined the piece as something that might have emerged, like a mythic beast, from a primal forest.
Even technology was about serving intangibles. The design renegades at Snowcrash, a Swedish design collaborative, managed to be both high-tech and evocative in a simple way with an inflatable room by Monica Forster, a designer from Stockholm. Her room, called Cloud, comes in a 26-pound golf-bag-size sack. Plug it in and a parachutelike material balloons within three minutes to conjure a space of 215 square feet, six and a half feet high. Ready for production, Cloud will cost about $2,200. "We're exposed to so many impressions all the time," Ms. Forster said. "It would be really good to have a quiet space for a timeout."
Roberto Cavalli, the Italian fashion designer with a Gypsy soul, understood better than most that, in these times of economic and political turmoil, furniture has to be more than functional. His over-the-top collection (and shag-rugadelic installation) featured a crystal vase with drooping petals and plates bursting with the image of one overblown rose. Visitors collapsed on a rolled futon with a Chanel-type tweed printed in red silk on one side and a zebra-hide pattern on the other. Sprawled on one of them was Yair Atias, a consultant for Tollman's, one of the largest furniture stores in Israel. He said he liked the gaudy red silk futon because "sometimes you have to find somewhere to rest, and it's nice if that somewhere is soft and the colors are very happy."

CORRECTION-DATE: April 25, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article last Thursday about the Milan furniture fair misspelled the surname of a visitor who criticized some design trends there and also the name of his family's textile company in New York. He is Michael Maharam, not Maharem; the company is Maharam.

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK; 
Rich Firms, Poor Ideas for Towers Site

BYLINE:  By HERBERT MUSCHAMP

 BODY:
Don't believe what you hear about the emergence of a consensus on the future of Lower Manhattan. To the extent that opinion has coalesced thus far around a particular set of options, the agreement represents a somewhat circumscribed point of view: that of New York's largest corporate architecture firms and the politically connected real estate-development industry they serve.
 This is the view presented in "Principles and Preliminary Blueprint for the Future of Lower Manhattan," a document issued last week by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, the state agency created to supervise the rebuilding of New York's financial district. Why are we not surprised? In the era of privatization, it's been a long time since urban planning was driven by other than market considerations. Public-private development projects are the way things get done. 
 But please. Let's not kid ourselves that the public comes out ahead when things are done this way, or that corporate architecture firms specializing in large-scale urban projects for corporate clients are the best instruments we have for deriving the greatest benefit from the public-private partnership format. 
The blueprint lists 11 "Principles for Action" and recommends a traditional city street grid to replace the twin towers' large open plaza. The principles (edited for length), are:
*Make decisions based on an inclusive and open public process
*Create a memorial for those lost in the 9/11 attacks
*Assist the revitalization of Lower Manhattan without precluding future development
*Coordinate and encourage infrastructure improvements
*Support Lower Manhattan as the world financial capital with new office space
*Develop a diverse mixed-use magnet for the arts, tourism, education and recreation, with residential, commercial and neighborhood amenities
*Develop a comprehensive transportation plan with expanded regional and local connections
*Connect neighborhoods and improve streets for pedestrian use
*Expand and enhance public and open spaces
*Preserve the historic character of Lower Manhattan and its cityscape
*Promote sustainability and excellence in design, for environmentally sensitive development.
These goals will seem oddly familiar to some readers. Indeed, most of them have been lifted, with modifications, from a document issued some weeks ago by New York New Visions, a coalition of civic groups and professional organizations formed not long after the World Trade Center disaster. In defense of the development corporation, it might be said that its adoption of the earlier report shows a constructive openness to consensus. But in fact, this provenance casts some doubt on the process by which this particular consensus was built.
New York New Visions was spun off last fall from an earlier group, NYCRebuild, which was formed by an alliance between two business groups, the New York City Real Estate Board and the New York City Partnership, along with the New York Chapter of the American Institute of Architects. This group's executive committee consisted mainly of partners from the city's largest corporate architecture firms and its leading development companies.
Participants in New York New Visions have been telling themselves, and others, that the spinoff group represents an independent, public service coalition. No doubt they believe this to be the case. In the last seven months, they have indeed volunteered time for meetings and urban design workshops, and there's no reason to disbelieve that this service was offered in good faith.
The key players in both groups are the same, however, and the overall mission is the same. That mission is two-fold: to redefine the future of Lower Manhattan as a set of architectural problems, and to expand the zone of action beyond ground zero and its immediate surroundings to include most of Manhattan south of Chambers Street. It has never been clear why this mission should be considered either desirable or inevitable, except insofar as it enables the private sector to reap a windfall after an international tragedy.
It would be useful to go down the list of principles and unpack them one by one. Each represents a significant crisis in the way cities are made. A historical view of these crises could yield constructive results. What forces, for example, have diminished the capacity of New York's Department of City Planning to implement these worthy goals?
For that matter, it is not clear whether even the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation has the authority to implement them. Last week, the corporation was forced to withdraw a request for proposals for comprehensive master plans, issued to 24 architecture and planning firms, when the Port Authority determined that the state agency had no right to build on the 16-acre ground zero site. This conflict should be seen not just as the usual bureaucratic comedy of errors, but as a potential topic for cultural study and creative exploration.
We are, after all, dealing with a heavily contested site. History has different claims upon it, as well as organized special-interest groups, and little effort has been made thus far to sort out those claims, or even identify them. Until such an effort is made, I see scant reason to hope that a modern equivalent of Brunelleschi's dome will arise in Lower Manhattan. And to judge from the record of recent accomplishment, I see little evidence of historical awareness on the part of the city's corporate architecture firms. In fact, these firms have been alarmingly out of touch with the evolving needs of the contemporary city in the globalizing world.
This could change. The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation could be an instrument for such a change. The blueprint, however, does not go far in that direction. What it offers, instead, is a parade of platitudes entirely consistent with the world view of a rigid status quo. That status quo revolves around a single unstated assumption: it is ultimately not possible to discriminate good from bad.
One thing is just as valuable as another thing: that is the consensus. Everything is a matter of taste, opinion, stylistic preference or the roll of the dice: that is the world view. Every problem is a design problem, and all designers are equally capable of solving a design problem. What a wonderful world it would be if this were true. Things can be different, but not hierarchically ranked. Out of Coke? I'll take Pepsi. 
Lately, some good work has come out of corporate offices. The new Baruch College building, by Kohn Pedersen Fox, is a fine example. The proposed new Penn Station, by Skidmore Owings & Merrill, is also first rate. Historic restoration projects by Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer and Beyer Blinder Belle are also major blessings of our time. In general, there is a sense that postmodern relativism can no longer be a license for mindlessness. 
The projects, however, that have reinvigorated the public's interest in architecture are predominantly the work of smaller firms, like those of Tod Williams and Billie Tsien; Christian de Portzamparc; Raimund Abraham; Renzo Piano; Jean Nouvel; and Rem Koolhaas. What is it, apart from talent, that distinguishes these offices from their corporate counterparts?
None of them subscribe to the myth of the omnicompetent designer. They are makers of objects, but more than that, they are connectors -- humanistic thinkers who piece together areas of information that lie beyond the architect's actual expertise. They bring with them -- or invent -- the context of meaning in which their work should be judged.
The blueprint does not provide such a context, or encourage its creation. No cultural connections are forged. The principles could be used to describe an edge city anywhere on earth. There is no acknowledgment that other areas of expertise might be drawn upon before the design process begins: history, economics, philosophy, global politics -- the entire range of disciplines on which any plausible interpretation of the World Trade Center tragedy must depend. But without a credible reading of 9/11, constructed from a global perspective, we will have no means of discriminating the value of whatever designs are put forth.

HEADLINE: A Cuban Filmmaker Gets His Voice Back 

BYLINE:  By MIREYA NAVARRO 

 BODY:
Humberto Solas, the honoree of this year's Havana Film Festival New York, opening today with his "Honey for Oshun," is producing a festival of his own. It will be the Poor Film Festival, a celebration of low-budget movies and the digital technology that makes them possible.
 Mr. Solas, 60, a director for more than 40 years and one of the most admired in Latin America, said that "Honey," his new film, was delayed by economic hardships that had shrunk film production in his native Cuba to three movies a year in the 1990's, down from as many as 15 the previous decade. 
 He says he is among those who have been able to restart or start their careers thanks to digital video and its lower costs comparable to film.
"Honey," the first digital film out of Cuba and Mr. Solas's first film in 10 years, represents not only his comeback, Mr. Solas said, but the promise of a technology that gives access, and greater independence and artistic freedom, to filmmakers everywhere who cannot get financing or must rely on co-productions with other countries to sidestep money troubles.
More crucially, he said, digital filmmaking, which captures images on digital videotape rather than on 35-millimeter film, ensures that more voices can be heard. 
"Digital film has the virtue of democratizing a profession that up to now has been very elitist," said Mr. Solas, who has scheduled his low-budget festival for November in Gibara, Cuba.
In Hollywood, the likes of Ben Affleck to George Lucas also laud digital filmmaking for making movies cheaper to produce and show and for encouraging innovation. But in Latin America and other places where financing productions is the main struggle even for proven filmmakers, the new technology can mean having a cinema industry at all. 
Mr. Solas said that "Honey" cost $200,000, a third of what it would have taken to shoot it using traditional film. 
Digital cameras are "the difference between making a movie or not making it at all," the Argentine director Eliseo Subiela said, adding, "The use of new technologies is a question of survival for certain cinema."
The festival, which runs through April 27, offers a sampling of Cuban and other Latin American films, featuring winners of the annual Havana Film Festival in Cuba (the most important competition for Latin American filmmakers). About a third of the films being shown were shot on digital video. The festival is a project of the American Friends of the Ludwig Foundation of Cuba, a nonprofit organization that fosters cultural exchanges between the United States and Cuba. The films will be shown at five theaters scattered about Manhattan, Queens and the Bronx. Festival information is available at www.hffny.com. 
The work of masters like Mr. Solas and Mr. Subiela and of emerging directors like Renato Falcao of Brazil will be featured. Mr. Falcao's surreal "Margarette's Feast," a satire about a search for happiness even for one day, is a silent film that will have its premiere at the festival on Wednesday. 
The festival is "a journey from the classics to where we are now," said Pedro Zurita, the festival's co-director and programming director. "It's a crossover from the classic filmmakers to the new generations and new technology."
Among the highlights are "The Invisible Kids" (Colombia), about a 7-year-old boy who uses black magic to make himself invisible to the girl he loves. Also included are documentaries, short and animated films, and representations from little-known film cultures, like those of Puerto Rico, Panama, Costa Rica and Ecuador.
The role played by Latin American literature in filmmaking will be examined in panel discussions with directors and onscreen. Among the films with literary roots are Mr. Subiela's "Dark Side of the Heart 2," inspired by the poems of Uruguayan novelist and poet Mario Benedetti and others, and two films -- "Miracle in Rome" (Colombia) and "No One Writes to the Colonel" (by the Mexican director Arturo Ripstein) -- based on the work of Gabriel Garcia Marquez.
"I love texts," said Mr. Subiela, whose films have a strong literary influence. "To say that cinema is only image is to impoverish it." 
Last year about 8,000 people attended the festival in Queens and Manhattan, said Mr. Zurita, the festival's co-director, and this year organizers have added the Bronx as a location to broaden their reach. Mr. Zurita said that in these boroughs the festival can find its natural audiences -- immigrants and New Yorkers with roots in Latin America who can help the cinemas of their home countries thrive. 
Mr. Zurita said the festival's organizers considered Mr. Solas one of the most talented and intellectual Latin American directors. His more than a dozen feature films include historical epics with large casts, and his most critically acclaimed film is "Lucia" (1968), which covers the history of Cuba since the 19th century through the lives of three women.
During his decadelong drought, Mr. Solas said, he wrote five scripts and taught direction in Cuba and overseas. He has had movies ravaged by critics in Cuba and projects shelved or rejected by the Cuban Institute of Cinematographic Art and Industry because of their subjects, like homosexuality, he said in an interview. But Mr. Solas, who is on an institute directors' panel that screens scripts and recommends which projects should go forward, said that aside from economic constraints, what discouraged him from making movies in the 1990's was a lack of enthusiasm for the state of movies in general.
"I felt banality had usurped the space," he said.
Recently, however, he has been invigorated by the emergence of the Dogma 95 movement, founded by a collective of Danish movie directors who eschew special effects, lighting and other mainstream cinematic technology for a more natural effect. Mr. Solas described his filmmaking as realistic and humanistic. 
"I want to reflect my epoch and world," he said.
"Honey for Oshun," a 2001 co-production with Spanish producers, deals with a man's return to Cuba years after he was abducted as a child by his father and taken to the United States. The desire to deal with the topic of reunification of Cuban families -- in the movie the man, Roberto, searches for the mother he left behind -- was prompted by the exodus of more than 30,000 Cubans who fled their country on rafts in the mid-1990's, Mr. Solas said, adding, "We suffered a lot when that happened." 
"Honey," written by his sister, Elia Solas, is a sentimental ode to family reconciliation between Cubans and Cuban-Americans. Mr. Solas himself has three nephews in the United States whose whereabouts he does not know, he said.
The film's criticism cuts both ways, but in a climactic scene Roberto screams about the identity crisis that hobbles some of those who leave Cuba -- he does not know whether he is American or Cuban.
"You at least know who you are," he tells his cousin and the driver that has accompanied them in their search for Roberto's mother. "Even if things are bad, even if you have problems, you understand each other. But not me. I'm nothing."

HEADLINE: Europe Seeks Fast Action In Steel Fight 

BYLINE:  By PAUL MELLER 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, April 17 

 BODY:
The European Commission is gathering support among the 15 European Union states for imposing retaliatory trade sanctions within the next two months on imports of steel products from the United States, several diplomats said today.
 "The commission has indicated to us that steel products will be the focus of the new target list for rapid sanctions," said a diplomat from one member state who insisted on anonymity. The United States exports up to $600 million worth of steel products annually to European Union countries. 
 The commission had already listed a wide range of products on which it planned to impose sanctions in response to the tariffs of up to 30 percent that the Bush administration imposed on some steel imports into the United States last month. 
The list, which includes textiles and citrus fruits, covers imports to the European countries from the United States that are worth more than $2 billion. It must be submitted to the World Trade Organization by mid-May. A disputes panel would then be set up. If the W.T.O. rules in the union's favor, sanctions that could take the form of 100 percent tariffs could be imposed on products listed. The process takes about 18 months.
But separate World Trade Organization rules allow for sanctions to be imposed almost immediately if so-called safeguard measures like the American tariffs are deemed unjustified and if the United States refuses to scrap the tariffs or pay compensation for their impact on importers. A commission spokesman, Anthony Gooch, said there was no sign the Bush administration would consider doing either.
The new, narrower target list being compiled by the commission is intended for just such a rapid response. Mr. Gooch said that under W.T.O. safeguard rules, the European Union would have to impose such sanctions within three months of the effective date of the United States protectionist tariffs. "If we don't apply the sanctions by June 18 then we lose the right to do so until after the W.T.O. panel has ruled," he said. "We have sketched out our thoughts in the hope of keeping open the option of applying such sanctions."
He refused to discuss the likely value of imports to be subject to fast-track sanctions, or which products would be included. But he did say it would be "poetic justice" if steel, the focus of the dispute, was the target.
The commission, which needs the support of the member state governments to pursue the fast-track sanctions approach, is set to consult with government officials on Friday.
The diplomat who insisted on anonymity said member states were more likely to back sanctions that focused purely on steel. "The wider list will harm more European firms," he said.
European Union companies that would be adversely affected by wider trade sanctions would include clothing retailers that buy textile products from the United States and companies with United States plants producing products on the list.
The union's trade commissioner, Pascal Lamy, said in a recent interview that the long list for sanctions under the standard W.T.O. disputes process was intended to maximize the political impact on the Bush administration. The products all come from important battleground states in the coming midterm elections, like Florida.
The diplomat said a list that focused purely on steel products would also have this effect. "Focusing on steel would target the same industry that the Bush administration is trying to win over with its protectionist import tariffs," he said.
"We are prepared to contemplate retaliation, but not if it's just a question of doing so by a W.T.O. deadline," he added. "It must be a conscious decision, and the political consequences must be thought through."
The World Trade Organization has said it will set in mid-June the maximum sanctions the European Union can impose on the United States for its foreign sales corporation tax code, which the W.T.O. has said is an illegal subsidy to American exporters. Though the European Commission has said there is no connection between this dispute and the steel tariff dispute, the Bush administration stance in the steel dispute has made it increasingly likely that the union will load on the sanctions in the tax code case.

HEADLINE: An Accessible World 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 In addressing the needs of a growing population of older people ("U.N. Offers Action Plan for a World Aging Rapidly," news article, April 14), the United Nations should not overlook the most basic and fundamental need of an aging population that will increasingly require the use of a wheelchair or other mobility aid: accessible communities. 
 New programs and services are meaningful only if the people they are intended to help can gain access to the buildings and facilities in which they are offered. 
Although the United States and other economically advantaged countries have made recent strides in accessibility, many of the countries that will be the focus of the United Nations' efforts have not. 
The United Nations should include accessibility as a priority need to be addressed worldwide and should help developing countries create functional accessible communities.

HEADLINE: Michigan Governor to Offer Energy Research Plan 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 17 

 BODY:
Gov. John Engler of Michigan will introduce a plan on Thursday that seeks to position the state as a center of research into alternative energy sources.
 The initiative, which is called the NextEnergy Plan, is expected to cost $30 million to $50 million over three to five years. It will include the development of a research center on a 700-acre plot near Ann Arbor, tax exemptions for businesses that conduct research on alternative energy, a venture capital fund to promote research and tax breaks for Michigan residents who buy automobiles or power sources that use alternative energy. 
 Much of the idea, said Governor Engler, a Republican barred by term limits from seeking re-election, is to ensure that Michigan is not left behind if the auto industry exchanges the internal combustion engine for a new technology.
"We don't want to be making buggy whips when everyone else is making the horseless carriage," he said.
The focus of much of the auto industry's current research has been the fuel cell, a hydrogen-powered energy source that, in its ideal state, would allow automakers to produce cars that do not use gasoline. Every large automaker is working on fuel cell technology, though it is expected to be at least a decade before vehicles powered by such fuel cells appear in any significant number.
The Michigan initiative will focus on many alternative energy sources, said Doug Rothwell, president of the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, and not just on automobiles. "People fixate on fuel cells," he said, "but between here and there will be other alternatives, like hybrid vehicles, methanol- or ethanol-fueled vehicles."
The project will also explore powering homes and setting up small power networks, called microgrids, that run on alternative energy sources, with the new research center itself a likely first experiment. 
Mr. Engler said the plan was "especially relevant" in light of the troubles in the Middle East and their effect on the oil market. The United States consumes nearly a quarter of the world's oil, much of it from the Mideast region. 
The auto industry, along with Michigan politicians of the two major parties, has argued that research on future technologies should take precedence over near-term increases in fuel-economy standards.
Environmental groups say that such research efforts, while intriguing, are often used as political cover to prevent cars' becoming more efficient.
For Michigan, the world's first area to mass-produce cars, the specter of a new automotive power system is worrisome. A recent state-sponsored study said 100,000 to 200,000 jobs could be lost if preparations were not made, and Mr. Engler said there was enough evidence to suggest that an evolutionary step was imminent. 
He hopes to make Michigan a research hub for the industry, national laboratories and universities, and set uniform standards for the new technologies. He will also press for federal research to be situated in the new center, which will be near the University of Michigan. 
John Casesa, a Merrill Lynch auto analyst, said such an initiative was "critical for Michigan, because if some day fuel cells replace the internal combustion engine, it would be a disaster for the state if these new engines were made somewhere else."
"All the senior technical people in the industry around the world are serious about" fuel cell technology, he said, adding, "People who are qualified to make a judgment are serious about it, and they were dismissive of things like electric cars."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
By some measures, there is still a need for government to prime the pump.

BYLINE:  By Jeff Madrick; Jeff Madrick is the editor of Challenge Magazine and of a new journal of social health, Indicators. Both publications are based in Armonk, N.Y. He is an adjunct professor of humanities at Cooper Union. E-mail: challenge@mesharpe.com.

 BODY:
THE conventional wisdom these days seems to be that if you blinked, you missed this recession. Some even argue there was no recession. They say there is a new economy, in which business now adjusts much faster than it once did, partly because it has better and quicker information on which to base decisions. Others say productivity growth will keep up because of heavy investment in high technology in the late 1990's. Others suggest that the embrace of free markets has simply made the economy more efficient; keep government out.
 But in fact, a closer look at the data shows that it was a typical recession by most measures, especially in terms of jobs lost. By some measures, it even lasted longer than other recessions. And the greatest irony is that it may well have been worse except for the government's reaction to the events of Sept. 11. Aggressive monetary and fiscal policy restored growth. The government apparently bailed us out. 
 The confusion begins with our overreliance on the gross domestic product -- the annual amount of goods, services, business investment and government spending -- as the arbiter of recession. Its other side is the nation's income: wages and salaries, profits, interest and rent. But G.D.P. doesn't tell us how many people have jobs or whether they are working longer. It doesn't tell us how much was borrowed to support capital spending or consumption. But if G.D.P., discounted for inflation, falls for two quarters, we are told we are in a recession.
This time around, G.D.P. fell only briefly. Over the course of the recession, which began in March 2001 and possibly ended late this winter, G.D.P. after inflation fell only 0.34 percent, according to the Economic Cycle Research Institute. The shallowest recession before this was in 1969 and 1970, when G.D.P. dipped 0.61 percent. The worst, by this measure, was the 1973-75 recession, when G.D.P. fell 3.4 percent.
But now let's look at employment. Jobs were lost at a far faster pace than the modest fall in G.D.P. suggests. According to the government's monthly payroll survey, the nation has lost about 1.4 million jobs since March 2001 -- more than in three of the six other recessions since 1960.
A better way to look at it is in percentage terms because the job market grows. Even so, the number of jobs fell 1.1 percent from March 2001 to last February. In other words, employment fell at three times the rate of the fall in G.D.P. This never happened before. In all recessions since 1973-75, employment fell about as much as G.D.P. In 1981-82, for example, jobs declined by 2.8 million, or about 3 percent, while G.D.P. fell 2.9 percent.
No wonder productivity rose this time. Productivity is nothing more than the number of hours worked divided by the output of goods and services. If the nation fires its workers much faster than its sales fall, productivity rises because hours worked for each dollar of revenue falls. What may be newest about this new economy is not information technology or free markets, but the freedom corporations have to fire at will.
Capital investment and profits also plunged. Industrial production fell proportionally more than it did in several past recessions, and the decline has lasted longer than ever before. Even the decline in employment has lasted as long as it did in most past recessions, and it has spread across as many industries.
Why did G.D.P. alone hold up? It may well have been the government reaction to Sept. 11, says Anirvan Banerji, managing editor at the Economic Cycle Research Institute. The alarming events provoked the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates sharply. As a consequence, Mr. Banerji said, auto companies could offer zero financing, and car sales drove G.D.P. up in the fourth quarter (and consumers borrowed against their homes).
At the same time, government spending rose rapidly in the battle against terrorism. Both auto sales and government spending rose enough to account alone for the 1.7 percent gain in G.D.P. in the fourth quarter, offsetting the sharp drop in capital spending.
Without the alarm set off by Sept. 11, Mr. Banerji said, it is possible that the economy might have slid into recession without provoking an adequate response from the Fed or fiscal stimulus from the White House and Congress.
What does this tell us about future growth? Some argue that with all the layoffs, business has positioned itself to improve profits and start investing again. But "The Boom and the Bubble" (Verso), a new book by Robert Brenner, a historian at the University of California at Los Angeles, raises some doubts. It is the best financial history of the period yet.
Mr. Brenner traces how the falling dollar from the mid-1980's to the early 1990's helped restore the profits of manufacturers by reducing export prices. He also shows how business's ability to keep wages down improved profits. With better profits, and more accommodative Federal Reserve policy, capital investment at last took off.
Even so, capital investment was soon generating a reduced return, and profitability began falling by 1997. But the rising stock market and low interest rates disguised the erosion because it allowed corporations to raise money and invest even without strong profit. Meantime, consumers also borrowed in lavish amounts.
Now the dollar is high again. Wages have risen strongly for five years. Borrowing is at record levels. The stock market, even if it stops falling, is highly unlikely to rise at the pace of the 1990's.
Does this mean we are entering a period of slow growth or are on the verge of another recession? Financial conditions are not everything. A continuing fall in computer prices and new standardized products can offset any financial obstacles.
But the financial risks are high. And neither information technology nor free markets have eliminated the business cycle. The best guess is slow growth for a long time, and another recession cannot be ruled out.
There is thus ample room for more fiscal stimulus, ideally social programs for the poor, who will spend the money. And the Fed should stay cautious about raising interest rates. We are not out of the woods yet.

HEADLINE: Ford Motor Reports Fourth Consecutive Quarterly Loss 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 17 

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company reported its fourth consecutive quarterly loss today, though its performance was better than analysts expected.
 The results were somewhat overshadowed by reports that a top executive was disgruntled and might leave the company. The executive, Wolfgang W. Reitzle, runs the Premier Automotive Group, Ford's luxury arm that oversees brands like Jaguar, Lincoln, Volvo and Aston Martin. 
 The luxury division is considered crucial to the success of the turnaround plan that Ford officials announced in January, aimed at reviving a company that lost $5.5 billion last year. That plan requires Premier to account for about a third of the company's profits by 2005, up from more than an eighth in 2000. 
In a conference call today, Nicholas V. Scheele, chief operating officer of Ford, dismissed suggestions that he and Mr. Reitzle were at odds and said that Mr. Reitzle, a former top executive at BMW, had not asked that the structure of his job be altered.
"Wolfgang has not requested any change," Mr. Scheele said. But Mr. Reitzle, noted for his expertise in car development, has recently sought, and not been given, a more prominent role at Ford, according to a person close to the matter.
Mr. Reitzle is said to have wanted a position akin to that of Robert Lutz, the former president of Chrysler who is now serving as a vice chairman for product development at General Motors.
David Bradley, an analyst at J. P. Morgan, said it was more important that executives at individual companies at Volvo and Jaguar remain in place. "That's where the critical personnel need to be," he said. 
John Casesa, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, said that Mr. Reitzle "had a combination of taste and experience that are hard to duplicate."
But he added that Mr. Reitzle had brought a dozen crucial executives from the outside and had set the table for the future development of Premier Automotive Group.
"It would be a disappointment but not fatal," Mr. Casesa said, adding, "the organization has enough momentum now to follow through."
In its earnings report today, Ford reported a net loss of $800 million, or 45 cents a share, in contrast to a $1.1 billion profit, or 56 cents a share, a year earlier.
Excluding special items, like a $708 million charge stemming from changes in accounting rules related to good will, the company lost 6 cents a share. That was ahead of a 15 cents-a-share loss that was the consensus estimate of financial analysts compiled by Thomson Financial/ First Call. 
The losses were deepened by the price war among the Big Three as they upped the ante on rebate and financing deals. Ford's United States marketing costs ate up 15.7 percent of its revenue in the first quarter, compared with 12.2 percent a year earlier. The company's sputtering sales of light trucks, which include sport utility vehicles, minivans and pickups, have also cut into its profitability.
Ford officials did say they were sticking to a previous projection of breaking even for the full year. Martin Inglis, Ford chief financial officer, added today that the company was comfortable with analysts' estimates of an 11-cent profit for the year. He also said that the company would return to profitability in the second quarter and even exceed analysts estimates, though he cautioned that production would fall sharply in the second half of the year.
Shares of Ford rose 32 cents, or 2 percent, to $16.18. 
"Our first-quarter performance shows that our revitalization plan efforts are taking hold and we are heading in the right direction," said William Clay Ford Jr., the company's chairman who took over as chief executive last October. 
Wall Street was less optimistic about a company that has frequently disappointed recently.
David Healy, an analyst at Burnham Securities, said "judging from the situation it was a decent quarter."
"The North American loss was smaller than you would have expected, from the volume they did," he said, adding it was a sign Ford was starting to reduce its costs.
"That was partly offset by them earning less than I expected from Ford Credit," he added. Ford Credit, the financing division, has been troubled by an aggressive practice of making risky loans. The unit earned $242 million, down from $406 million a year earlier. 
The company's Hertz rental car unit has also struggled along with the rental car industry after the terrorist attacks. It posted a loss of $48 million, compared with a $4 million loss a year earlier.
Mr. Casesa said: "Ford is in a bathtub-shaped recession. It's going to bump along the bottom for some time.
"It's likely the next several quarters will mirror the results of the first," he added. "Bad loans, lack of important new products, and excess costs take some time to eliminate."
Mr. Bradley of J. P. Morgan said "they did a good job of clearing a low hurdle."

HEADLINE: MIDEAST TURMOIL; 
Powell, in His Comments, Outlines a 3-Point Strategy

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a news conference held yesterday by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell in Jerusalem on the conclusion of his Middle East trip, as transcribed by the Federal News Service Inc. The full text is available at nytimes.com/world.
 On April 4, President Bush offered a powerful statement of America's determination to fight terrorism, end the violence in the Middle East and move toward peace. The president's vision as first outlined in his speech to the United Nations last November points toward two states: Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security. 
 The president also posed challenges to the parties themselves: for the Palestinians to reject violence and terrorism as a means of settling this conflict; for the Israelis to bring the current military operation to an end; for both sides to resume security cooperation and to find a way back to negotiations. For our Arab and international partners to work with us against terrorism and help the parties find a path toward a more hopeful future.
The president asked me to travel to a region in turmoil. Recent events have taken an enormous toll, human lives lost, families shattered, economic activity frozen and mounting humanitarian distress. Israelis and Palestinians alike deserve lives free from the fear of violence with hope for a stable future and a chance for economic prosperity.
An additional cause of tension is the ongoing threat posed by attacks by Hezbollah and others across the United Nations's recognized Blue Line. It was for that reason I traveled to Beirut and Damascus to underscore the president's strong message to all parties to exercise restraint.
In my consultations over the past 10 days with our international partners, our Arab friends and Israelis and Palestinians, I have listened carefully and I have probed hard. I have found broad support for a comprehensive strategy as a way forward. 
The Madrid Quartet meeting we had last week published a strong declaration endorsing this comprehensive approach. In that declaration, the United States, the United Nations, the European Union and the Russian Federation were united in this endorsement.
There are three critical elements in this comprehensive strategy: First, security and freedom from terror and violence for Israelis and Palestinians; next, serious and accelerated negotiations to revive hope and lead to a political settlement; and third, economic humanitarian assistance to address the increasingly desperate conditions faced by the Palestinian people.
Let me address each of these elements. 
Confronting and ending terrorism are indispensable steps on the road to peace. In my meetings with Chairman Arafat I made it clear that he and the Palestinian Authority could no longer equivocate. They must decide, as the rest of the world has decided, that terrorism must end. Chairman Arafat must take that message to his people. He must follow through with instructions to his security forces. He must act to arrest and prosecute terrorists, disrupt terrorist financing, dismantle terrorist infrastructure and stop incitement. . . .
Prime Minister Sharon has stated his intention to complete Israel's withdrawal from the areas that it recently occupied. He has provided me with a time line through this weekend and as you all know, reservists are now returning home. I stressed to the prime minister the urgency of completing withdrawal and have been assured of real results in the next few days.
I recognize the particular circumstances at the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem and the presidential compound in Ramallah, as well as the importance of their urgent nonviolent resolution. Our goal remains the full implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1402. 
Only with the end of the incursion and with the engagement in security talks can a cease-fire be achieved in reality, as well as rhetoric. And so I look forward to the completion of the withdrawal, as soon as possible, as the prime minister has said, so that we can move forward with the strategic framework that I have described.
Improvement in the security situation must be linked to the second point, determined pursuit of a political solution. There can be no peace without security, but there can also be no security without peace. Only a negotiated settlement can resolve the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. 
We must find a way to bring together traditional elements such as United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, with new initiatives, such as my Louisville speech last November and U.N. Resolution 1397. And one of the most promising of these new initiatives was launched by Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia and recently endorsed at the Arab League summit. . . .
Finally, the third element. The international community must address the dire humanitarian problems as well as the long-term economic needs of the Palestinian people. During my visit to Jerusalem, I was pleased to announce that the United States would contribute an additional $30 million in support of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency and their programs in providing health, education, relief and social services to Palestinian refugees.
This is beyond the $80 million we already provide annually.
The international humanitarian and aid agencies must have the freedom and access that they need to do their jobs. Also the international donors will meet in Norway later this month to increase assistance to the Palestinian people at this time of exceptional need.

HEADLINE: Overseers Approve Nassau's Plan to Solve Its Budget Crisis 

BYLINE:  By BRUCE LAMBERT 

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY, N.Y., April 17 

 BODY:
"But" was the operative word today as state-appointed overseers unanimously adopted Nassau County's four-year plan to solve its fiscal crisis.
 The oversight agency, the Nassau County Interim Finance Authority, began by praising the scope and ambition of the plan submitted by the new county executive, Thomas R. Suozzi. But then the authority quickly noted many criticisms and cautions. 
 "The work ahead is the hard part," said the authority's chairman, Frank G. Zarb. "The challenges are horrendous." Mr. Zarb warned that "any backsliding of any kind is unacceptable" and would risk a full-scale state takeover of the county's finances.
The authority demanded to see significant progress by September in closing the county's budget gap. It also insisted on cooperation from labor unions. Some authority members objected to Mr. Suozzi's proposals for extending debts, creating a sewer authority and issuing bonds with variable interest rates. Others warned about the pitfalls of medical center deficits, rising pension costs and the uncertainty of proposals that require state legislation.
Nassau's political infighting was also a concern. The authority has bipartisan cooperation from top state leaders in Albany, said Mr. Zarb, a Republican. "When I ask the governor for something, I get it in a minute, but when we get down to the county, the food fight starts," he said. "If we can't put ourselves together here as a group and make this thing happen, we're going to miss a giant opportunity."
Mr. Suozzi is a Democrat, and his plan was opposed by the County Legislature's Republican minority. None of the Republican legislators appeared at today's agency meeting, and their absence was criticized by the Legislature's presiding officer, Judith A. Jacobs, a Democrat. Later, the Republicans said they missed the meeting because no one had told them about it, but the agency said it had made its usual notifications.
The Suozzi plan would raise the county's share of the property tax by nearly 20 percent next year, or about $182 for the median homeowner. His plan would also cut the work force by 1,200, or about 1 in 8, jobs. Added savings would come from union concessions, improved management, refinanced debt and revamped property assessments.
Starting with a compliment today, one authority member, Ronald A. Stack, said: "I thought this report was remarkable. I was truly amazed." But he went on to criticize the county's proposals to spread debt over more years and to create a sewer authority. Another member, Martin D. Payson, said: "I'm not happy with creating a separate authority. I really don't see the benefit of it."
Mr. Suozzi thanked the agency for approving his overall plan and said he was eager to satisfy the critics' concerns. The agency agreed to his request for a further meeting to explain the proposed refinancing, which includes paying off some debt early and reducing both the total debt and annual debt costs.
Mr. Suozzi will also defend the sewer authority proposal, which he said would qualify for subsidized interest rates and thus save taxpayers money. He promised to impose safeguards against abuses by the authority like patronage or selling the sewer system.
Although credit-rating agencies have praised the plan, Mr. Zarb cautioned the county against getting carried away. "Wall Street didn't cheer this," he said. "Wall Street was relieved. They did the equivalent of asking Dr. Kevorkian to leave the room because the patient has a chance of surviving."
Mr. Suozzi said: "We're not going to relax now. We're going right back to work."

HEADLINE: 5 Men, One With Political Connections, Are Indicted in $42 Million Bank and Tax Fraud 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT F. WORTH 

 BODY:
Federal prosecutors announced charges yesterday against a politically connected Manhattan businessman and his partner, accusing them and three of their hotel business associates of defrauding five banks of more than $42 million.
 The Manhattan businessman, Stanley S. Tollman, and his partner, Monty D. Hundley, are accused of running a complex scheme with the help of an employee, an accountant and a lawyer to avoid repaying tens of millions of dollars they had borrowed from banks to build their hotel business. 
 The two men also avoided taxes on millions of dollars in income, according to an indictment unsealed late Tuesday in United States District Court in Manhattan. They did so by not filing tax returns, concealing offshore bank accounts from tax advisers and the Internal Revenue Service, and having their businesses pay for personal items like the insurance on Mr. Tollman's fleet of luxury cars, including Rolls-Royces, Bentleys and an Aston Martin, prosecutors said. 
John J. Tigue Jr., a lawyer for Mr. Tollman, said, "Mr. Tollman intends to plead not guilty and defend himself in court." A lawyer for Mr. Hundley did not return a call seeking comment yesterday. They will be arraigned on Wednesday, said a spokesman for the United States attorney's office.
Four of the five men charged Tuesday were also connected with Alpha Hospitality Corporation, a gambling company that has been involved in efforts to build a casino in the Catskills with the St. Regis Mohawk tribe. Until February, Mr. Tollman was the chairman and chief executive of Alpha.
The company had been a contender to become the casino's chief developer, but two years ago Alpha lost that opportunity to Park Place Entertainment. Alpha is now a party to a suit against Park Place, and is likely to own slot machines at the casino regardless of the suit's outcome. Mr. Hundley was a longtime officer of Alpha, resigning in 1995.
Until 1995 Alpha included on its board of directors Charles A. Gargano, a prominent Republican fund-raiser and friend of Mr. Tollman's who is now chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, the state's chief economic development agency. Mr. Gargano's role in the company led to criticism in the Legislature during his confirmation hearings, and as a result he promised to resign from Alpha's board of directors and sell his stock. 
According to the indictment released yesterday, Mr. Tollman and Mr. Hundley, of Bedford, N.Y., began building a hotel business in 1979, borrowing money from banks that ran within a decade into the hundreds of millions. In 1989 they bought the Days Inn hotel chain's corporate parent for $765 million, using mostly borrowed money.
A year later they declared bankruptcy and sold the parent company, while retaining their substantial ownership of Days Inn franchises, which they had bought separately. They then told their creditors, including Chemical Bank, National Westminster Bank, First National Bank of Chicago, Marine Midland and Security Pacific, now Bank of America, that they could not repay their debt, according to the indictment.
But they lied to the banks about their assets, concealing about $100 million worth of stock they had gained in the sale of the Days Inn parent company, prosecutors said. Both men also concealed private properties, including homes belonging to Mr. Tollman in Manhattan, Florida, Connecticut and London worth more than $13.5 million, according to the indictment.
In addition, the two men enlisted a New York businessman to pose as the representative of European investors who were hoping to buy the banks' debt at a steep discount, prosecutors said. 
In fact, those investors were straw firms controlled by Mr. Tollman and Mr. Hundley, who used them to repurchase surreptitiously more than $50 million of their own debt for less than $7.6 million, prosecutors said. According to the indictment, relatives of Mr. Tollman who did not share his last name served as officers of the two companies, Paternoster Holdings and Chelsea Acquisitions. The government also charged both men with evading taxes on the income they had effectively gained by reducing their debt through the fake European investors. 
Howard Zukerman, who worked at various companies controlled by Mr. Tollman and Mr. Hundley, and was another of the men indicted Tuesday, was also indicted two years ago on charges of tax evasion. The two other men indicted Tuesday were Sanford Freedman, who worked as their lawyer; and James Cutler, who worked for them as an accountant. Lawyers for the three men said yesterday that they intended to fight the charges.

HEADLINE: Scientists Question Hormone Therapies For Menopause Ills 

BYLINE:  By DENISE GRADY 

 BODY:
A new report by a panel of international experts casts doubt on longstanding claims that hormone replacement can prevent or treat a variety of ills in postmenopausal women, including heart disease, Alzheimer's disease, severe depression, urinary incontinence and broken bones caused by osteoporosis.
 While hormone therapy is the most effective way to relieve menopausal symptoms like hot flashes and night sweats, there is not enough scientific evidence to support its use for the other problems, says the report, which is to be published in June. The hormone treatments have well-documented drawbacks, including an increased risk of blood clots and gall bladder disease and breast cancer with prolonged use. 
 More than 40 million American women are 50 or older, and 20 million more will reach menopause within the next decade. About 20 percent of women who reach menopause naturally use hormone replacement at least temporarily, according to the North American Menopause Society. The figure is higher among women who reach menopause early because their ovaries have been surgically removed. 
Hormone replacement usually consists of estrogen with another hormone, progestin, or -- for women who have had hysterectomies -- estrogen alone.
Given the known risks and limited benefits of hormone treatments, the report says, each woman and her doctor should weigh her medical history carefully when deciding whether she really needs it. Drugs to lower cholesterol and blood pressure are a better way to cut the risk of heart disease for many women, and other nonhormonal drugs may be a better way to prevent fractures.
That advice is a departure from decades of medical practice in which many women and their doctors assumed that taking estrogen at menopause was a way to preserve youth and health. American women spent $2.75 billion on hormone replacement in 2001, according to IMS Health, a company that tracks drug sales. Premarin, a form of estrogen replacement therapy sold by Wyeth, was the third most commonly prescribed drug in the United States last year, with more than 45 million prescriptions dispensed.
The new report, called the International Position Paper on Women's Health and Menopause, was financed by the National Institutes of Health and the private Giovanni Loren Zini Medical Science Foundation of Italy. It reviews existing studies and was compiled by 28 doctors and scientists from the United States, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland and Australia. 
Dr. Nanette K. Wenger, chief of cardiology at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, who was an editor of the report and chairwoman of the panel that prepared it, said the report tried to put up-to-date information into one publication that doctors all over the world could use.
The report's cautious approach to hormones is based on the findings of recent studies and on its authors' decision to emphasize "evidence-based medicine" -- that is, treatments tested in randomized controlled trials.
Such trials, in which patients are assigned at random to either a treatment or a placebo, are considered the gold standard in medical research. By contrast, observational studies, in which patients themselves decide whether to take a drug, are considered less reliable.
Observational studies have suggested many health benefits from hormone replacement, but more recent controlled trials have disagreed. Researchers say the observational studies may have painted a falsely rosy picture of hormone replacement because women who opt for the treatments are healthier and have better habits to begin with than women who do not.
The full report is to be issued in June by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, but a chapter on hormone replacement and other treatments was distributed at a symposium last month at the National Institutes of Health.
Researchers who worked on the report said some of its findings might shock doctors and patients. 
Dr. Vivian W. Pinn, director of the institutes' office of research on women's health and another editor of the report, said that many people, including physicians, had believed that hormone replacement would prevent heart disease and strokes and help women live longer.
But, Dr. Pinn said, "as we're learning more from long-term studies and better defined studies over the past few years, all these things we've thought about the wonders of hormone replacement may not be holding up under scrutiny." 
Dr. Wenger added: "Given the fact that hormone replacement has been around for half a century, it's really only in the last decade that we've begun to get stringent scientific evidence, from randomized controlled trials. In many areas there have been enormous surprises."
For instance, Dr. Wenger said, three recent controlled trials have found that, rather than protecting women from heart attacks and strokes, hormone replacement increased their risk. One trial in women who already had heart disease showed no benefit from four years of hormone treatment and a 50 percent increase in the risk of heart attack in the first year of treatment. 
Another study, which includes more than 27,000 women, most without heart disease at the start of the trial, found a slight increase after three years in heart attacks, strokes and blood clots in the lungs in women taking hormones. That study will not be completed until 2006.
A third study found no benefit to hormone treatment after 2.8 years, and a more than doubling of the risk of stroke in the first six months. 
Last year, the American Heart Association warned that women should not regard hormone replacement as a means of treating or preventing heart disease. Even though hormones can help lower LDL cholesterol -- the "bad" kind of cholesterol -- and raise HDL cholesterol -- the "good" kind -- the group said that statin drugs were a far better way to do so. 
Hormone replacement can prevent bone loss from osteoporosis, and observational studies have suggested that it reduces the risk of fractures. But bone loss resumes once a woman stops taking hormones. Moreover, no large randomized controlled trials have been conducted to determine whether the treatment reduces fractures. The Food and Drug Administration has approved hormone therapy to prevent osteoporosis, but not to treat it. 
Another group of drugs called bisphosphonates prevent bone loss about as well as estrogen, and have been proved to cut the risk of fractures by 40 percent to 50 percent in women with osteoporosis.
Dr. Wenger said that doctors had long assumed that hormone replacement would help older women who suffered from urinary incontinence. "But now two trials show no improvement, and there may be a worsening," she said.
The reports notes that many doctors thought estrogen would prevent memory loss and slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease. But clinical trials have shown no benefit in early Alzheimer's disease. Studies on memory loss are still being done.
Similarly, there is no evidence that hormones can treat severe depression in postmenopausal women. But the report notes that hormones may improve "mood and well-being" in women who suffer from hot flashes and night sweats that disturb their sleep.
"So many of the earlier presumptions, as they come to trial, do not show evidence of benefit," Dr. Wenger said. 
Dr. Deborah Grady, a professor of epidemiology and medicine at the University of California at San Francisco, was lead author of the 1992 guidelines on hormone replacement for the American College of Physicians.
At that time, she said, "I thought preventive hormone therapy should probably be prescribed to most postmenopausal women, except those at high risk for breast cancer," and incorporated that view into the guidelines.
Today, Dr. Grady said, "rather than prescribing it for most postmenopausal women, I prescribe it for symptoms, for which it is far and away the best treatment."
In many women, she said, hot flashes diminish after three to six months even without treatment, though they may not end for four to five years.
"I spend a lot of my life now trying to figure out how to help women taper off estrogen," Dr. Grady said.
Dr. Wenger said that, in contrast to the year 1900, when few women survived much past menopause, women today in developed countries live a third of their lives after menopause.
"We must require that medical management be based on the same stringent scientific evidence that we've always required for the treatment of men," she said.

HEADLINE: Hard Decisions For Employers As Costs Soar In Health Care 

BYLINE:  By REED ABELSON 

 BODY:
Employers are bracing for their third year in a row of double-digit increases in health care costs, according to industry consultants and analysts. The sharply higher costs could lead many employers to offer fewer health plans, reduce what they cover or shift more costs to employees.
 Companies will probably face average increases of 12 to 15 percent in 2003, compared with a projected increase of 12.7 percent this year, according to preliminary estimates from Mercer Human Resource Consulting, based on early discussions some employers are having with insurers. 
 But costs for some employers will rise much more sharply. The California Public Employees' Retirement System, known as Calpers, announced yesterday that premiums for the health maintenance organizations it uses would increase an average of 25 percent and premiums for other plans would rise around 20 percent. 
Some other large employers are being asked to pay as much as twice what they had been paying, and increases of roughly 25 percent are common, said Kenneth Sperling, a consultant with Hewitt Associates.
Still, small companies will probably face some of the largest increases, according to health care experts. If premiums for Calpers, which provides health insurance to about 1.2 million state and local employees, dependents and retirees, are increasing by 25 percent, "we'll be seeing increases far exceeding that for small businesses," said Peter Lee, the president of the Pacific Business Group on Health, an employers' group that negotiates with health plans.
The steep increases could lead many employers to shift a greater proportion of health care costs to their workers, some of whom may not be able to afford the higher premiums and co-payments. Employees "are going to pay a lot more out of pocket, and we're going to see a huge spike in the number of uninsured," Mr. Lee said.
Many health care experts predict that employers could experience double-digit cost increases for the next several years.
"There is nothing on the horizon that would cause me to think that double-digit increases are going away," said Randall K. Abbott, a senior consultant at the consulting company Watson Wyatt, who predicts that these increases will continue three to five years. 
The last time annual increases of more than 10 percent were common was in the late 1980's and early 1990's, before managed care took hold.
Cost increases slowed or reversed for a few years in the mid- 1990's. But managed care companies, especially those in California, have now wrung many easy-to-find costs out of the system, and hospitals facing rising admissions and increasing labor costs are demanding sharply higher payments from insurers. In addition, as ever more costly drugs are introduced, prescription costs are rising by double-digit percentages each year.
Many managed care companies are now choosing to risk losing a contract rather than holding premiums relatively steady as their own costs escalate. "They're not willing to destroy their margins to hold onto their unprofitable business," said Andrea Urban, a health care analyst for Merrill Lynch.
Officials at Calpers, which was particularly successful in using its influence to hold down health-care costs for much of the last decade, see fewer opportunities now to keep costs down as the population ages and makes greater use of new drugs and technology. The organization is choosing not to reduce the benefits it offers or to increase the proportion an employee pays for care, but people covered through Calpers will still face a substantial increase in their own costs.
Some consultants say California, which was early and enthusiastic in its embrace of managed care, is facing unusual pressures on its health care system today. "California is a very mature, very competitive H.M.O. marketplace," where cost pressures are particularly acute, Mr. Abbott said.
Calpers officials say, however, that their experience reflects what is happening around the country as employers struggle with double-digit health care cost increases at a time when the overall economy has been weak.
"This is a national problem," said William Crist, the president of the Calpers board of administration.
Calpers plans to work with other large employers to begin discussions with policy makers in Washington about what, if any, steps the government should take to address these issues. 
"I don't think policy makers have woken up to how bad things are," Mr. Lee said.
As part of rethinking its health care strategy, Calpers has also decided to drop its PacifiCare and HealthNet plans and work more closely with existing plans through Blue Shield, Kaiser Permanente and some regional insurers.
Calpers is also considering other alternatives, including a self-financed health insurance plan managed by an outside company. 
Other employers are expected to follow the example of Calpers and reduce the number of plans they offer, as long as they do not force too many of their employees to find new doctors, several consultants said. The employers' decisions to drop plans could, in turn, force some insurers out of business and lead others to combine.
"The industry is going through a consolidation phase, and this will accelerate it further," Mr. Sperling said.

HEADLINE: Imports Lift Trade Deficit to $31.5 Billion 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 17 

 BODY:
The United States trade deficit grew in February to the widest in 10 months as a recovering economy fueled demand for imported automobiles, televisions and business equipment, the government reported today.
 The $31.5 billion trade gap was larger than expected and 11.6 percent wider than the $28.2 billion deficit in January, figures from the Commerce Department showed. 
The rise in imports was three times that of exports. 
 The deficit, the biggest since $31.9 billion in April 2001, may keep growing as companies like Toyota and Sony ship more products to the United States to meet increased consumer spending. 
Analysts had expected a $29 billion deficit for February. Imports, which rose 4 percent, are expected to keep rising after consumer spending rose in the fourth quarter at the strongest pace in three and a half years, helping inventories fall by a record $119.3 billion.
Imports of consumer goods rose 4.6 percent, to $24.4 billion, the largest since March of last year, reflecting increased demand for furniture, toys and televisions.
Imports of autos, parts and engines jumped 10.5 percent, to $16.5 billion, the highest since October 2000.
February imports of capital goods excluding automobiles rose 2.1 percent, to $23.8 billion, reflecting a rise in demand for semiconductors and telecommunications equipment, the report showed.
The value of oil imports fell 17.9 percent, to $4 billion, in February from $4.9 billion in January. The United States imported 243.5 million barrels in February, less than the 301 million a month earlier, as the price rose to $16.56 a barrel from $16.31.

I.B.M. Posts 32% Decline In Earnings on Poor Demand
I.B.M., the No. 1 computer maker, blamed balky customers who deferred purchases for a 32 percent drop in first-quarter profit.
 The company had softened the blow last week when it warned analysts that its earnings would fall far short of expectations -- I.B.M.'s first such warning in more than 10 years. The earnings report was in line with the revised estimates of Wall Street analysts. Page C6. 

Ford Beats Estimates With Its Loss
Ford Motor reported its fourth consecutive quarterly loss, though its performance surpassed analysts' estimates. The results were somewhat overshadowed by reports that a top executive, Wolfgang W. Reitzle, was disgruntled and might leave. He runs the division that oversees brands like Jaguar and Volvo. C8.

J.P. Morgan Earnings Drop 18%
J. P. Morgan Chase reported an 18 percent drop in first-quarter earnings, but they beat Wall Street expectations, offering investors some optimism for the first time after several quarters of weak results. J. P. Morgan reported net income of $982 million, or 48 cents a share, compared with $1.2 billion, or 58 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. C4.

Fox Is Canceling 'Ally McBeal'
"Ally McBeal," the Fox network show that hit a nerve in speaking to viewers about contemporary relationships between the sexes, will come to an end at the conclusion of the current season, the show's creator, David E. Kelley, and Fox executives announced. C10.

Teamsters Protest Coke at Meeting
The Teamsters union demanded that Coca-Cola adopt and enforce strict labor standards for the manufacture of its products around the world. The union accused Coke of abdicating responsibility for the murder of eight union leaders who organized workers at bottling plants in Colombia over the last decade, an accusation the company denies.

Michigan Pushes Alternative Energy
Gov. John Engler of Michigan will introduce a plan today that seeks to position the state as a center of research into alternative energy sources. Much of the idea for the initiative, which is called the NextEnergy Plan, said Governor Engler, left, is to ensure that Michigan is not left behind if the auto industry exchanges the internal combustion engine for a new technology. It will cost $30 million to $50 million over three to five years. C8.

HEADLINE: 2 Sides Push On Arctic Oil, But Proposal Lacks Votes 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 17 

 BODY:
Arctic Power, an organization formed to lobby for oil and gas exploration in the Alaska wilderness, sent Inupiat Eskimos to the offices of senators today to emphasize the importance of economic development to Native Alaskans.
 The League of Conservation Voters, which publishes an annual scorecard of how lawmakers vote on environment-related legislation, delivered a letter to all senators saying the votes this year on new drilling in Alaska would count double. 
 Both sides were scrambling to round up last-minute support before the crucial vote in the Senate on Thursday morning on a central part of President Bush's energy policy: a measure that would permit tapping the sizable oil and gas reservoir beneath the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a stretch of untouched wilderness and potential wealth on the north coast of Alaska.
By nearly all accounts, the outcome was no longer in doubt. Senators who are tracking votes agreed today that the proponents of new exploration would fail to get the 60 votes they need to win under the Senate rules. Some of the vote-counters suggested that the proponents might not have even a bare majority of 51 votes. 
One of the last undecided senators, Blanche Lincoln, Democrat of Arkansas, announced that she would oppose drilling in the wildlife reserve, and by at least one count, she was the 51st senator to come out in opposition.
Legislation to allow exploration in the refuge was passed by the House last year, but it cannot become law without Senate approval.
The vote on Thursday will come on a motion to shut off debate on the issue, a test vote set up by Democratic leaders to prove to Republicans that there are not 60 votes in favor of drilling in the wilderness.
The phone calls and the buttonholing in Senate offices today were the culmination of some of the most intense lobbying in years, on a measure that many lawmakers admit is more important symbolically and politically than substantively.
The oil companies themselves would like to have the ban on exploration in the refuge lifted. But their support is not particularly enthusiastic, because of the high cost of producing oil and gas in the remote area. The issue has become a touchstone, on the other hand, for conservatives generally and the Bush administration particularly.
Stephen Moore, president of the Club for Growth, which raises money for conservative political candidates, explained why conservatives see the issue as a matter of principle.
"There is a belief on the environmentalist side that we're running out of oil, that we have to conserve energy," Mr. Moore said.
"I'm adamantly opposed to energy conservation," he continued. "We're not running out. All we have to do is go out and find it and produce it."
Betsy Loyless, political director of the League of Conservation Voters, said the issue had become a symbolic one for her side, too.
"It is a litmus test to see who favors a flawed energy policy that relies on fossil fuels," Ms. Loyless said, "and who supports a newer, cleaner energy policy."
The issue has been before Congress for more than a decade, and the dogmatic approach of both proponents and opponents, putting compromise out of the question, has frustrated some politicians who have tried to find a middle ground.
A Democrat from the Northeast who considers himself a strong environmentalist said he had once tried quietly to see if he could broker a deal in which Democrats would back limited exploration in the wildlife reserve and Republicans would support much tougher fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks.
The Democrat said he quickly gave up when it became apparent that the environmental organizations would not budge in their opposition to new drilling.
"If you told the environmentalists we would end global warming once and for all in return for ANWR," he said, "they'd still say no."
For more than a year, opponents of drilling have been running radio and television advertisements in the states of key lawmakers, but most of the effort against new exploration has been devoted to what Ms. Loyless called "the biggest grass-roots lobbying campaign in a decade."
The environmentalists were opposing a formidable lobbying campaign organized by Arctic Power, which gets most of its multimillion-dollar budget from the Alaska state government but also receives backing from oil and gas companies, labor unions and private citizens.
Arctic Power retained Qorvis Communications, a public relations firm, to run a $1.8 million national campaign to win public support for exploration in the refuge and hired Patton Boggs, one of Washington's most prominent lobbying firms and one usually associated with Democrats, to press the case in the capital.

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Asia: Singapore: Exports Decline 

BYLINE:  By Wayne Arnold (NYT) 

 BODY:
 Singapore said its exports, excluding oil, fell 17.3 percent in March compared with a year ago. The drop was led by a decline in shipments of personal computers, disk drives and computer chips to Singapore's biggest market, the United States. Though it was the 13th consecutive monthly drop in exports, the decline was slower than in February, and economists said they still expected a recovery this year. Thailand is reporting a similar trend, with a minister saying that exports in March fell about 5 percent but declined more slowly than in the previous two months.

 Apple has been looking for a way to break out of its shrinking niche in the personal computer industry and win back market share, and the quarter's numbers indicated that it had made some progress. 
 Coming as the computer industry is seeing mixed indicators of a possible economic upturn, Apple reported net profit of $40 million, or 11 cents a share, for the second quarter. Net profit was down slightly from the 2001 quarter, when Apple earned 12 cents a share. 
But revenue reached $1.5 billion compared with $1.43 billion a year ago, a 4.9 percent increase. Analysts had predicted revenue of $1.46 billion. Analysts had also expected a profit of 6 cents to 12 cents a share, with a consensus of 10 cents, Thomson Financial/First Call reported.
"While most of our competition have been reducing their investment in R&D and head count, Apple has been increasing its investment in R&D," Fred Anderson, Apple's chief financial officer, said.
He said that Apple's spending on research and development reached a low point of about $300 million in 1999, but had since risen sharply and might reach $450 million in 2002.
Financial analysts supported Mr. Anderson's view, arguing that Apple was outperforming other PC makers during a generally dismal period for the industry.
"It was a strong quarter," said David Bailey, a financial analyst at Gerard Klauer Mattison & Company. "This is typically a weak quarter, and the new iMac allowed them to buck the trend."
The company said it continued to be pleased with its new consumer strategy based on an expanding network of Apple retail stores. Apple has opened 29 stores since starting its chain last May, and said it would open another 20 stores this year. The company had originally forecast that the stores would become profitable by the end of last year. Today, Mr. Anderson said he hoped that the stores could have a profitable quarter before the end of 2002.
The company said that about 40 percent of the buyers at the Apple stores were purchasing a Macintosh for the first time.
Analysts said that Apple's ability to increase this percentage was crucial to its success.
"Forget about the product cycle," said Charles Wolf, a financial analyst at Needham & Company. "The real key is, can Apple capture new users in the Apple stores, because they have to expand their base."
Apple, which is based in Cupertino, Calif., introduced the iMac with flat-panel display in January, and the machine drew positive reviews and extensive media coverage. The iMac was to have sold for as little as $1,299, but last month Apple said that because of component shortages it was raising the price by $100 on all models.
Despite the price increase, the computer maker said that its gross margins would remain under pressure for much of the rest of year, in the face of increased component costs, its decision to air freight some of the machines from Taiwan to the United States and an increasing percentage of the lower-margin computers.
Today, Mr. Anderson said he expected Apple to catch up with demand in the current quarter and noted that manufacturing rates had risen to almost 10,000 machines daily in the final days of the quarter. The company said it had shipped 220,000 iMacs in its first quarter and 813,000 Macintosh systems over all, an increase of 8 percent from the quarter a year ago.
The company's portable systems grew by 22 percent while its desktop G4 Macintosh sales were flat for the quarter, Mr. Anderson said.
Apple also sold 57,000 of its iPod portable music players in the quarter.

HEADLINE: Court Witness Says Microsoft Financed Work 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 17 

 BODY:
An economist testifying for Microsoft in its antitrust case acknowledged today that the company had at least partly financed all the research he had published on the software industry since 1998. 
 The economist, Kevin M. Murphy of the University of Chicago, had said in testimony that began Tuesday that strong penalties sought by nine states were unwarranted because there was no proof that illegal acts by Microsoft had actually stopped competitors from succeeding. 
 Stephen Kuney, a lawyer for the nine states that are seeking broad restrictions on Microsoft, said today that Mr. Murphy had done little work in the antitrust field until he began working for Microsoft as a consultant in 1998. Mr. Murphy did not challenge Mr. Kuney. 
The nine states have rejected a proposed settlement of the four-year case, saying stronger measures are necessary to prevent Microsoft from abusing its Windows software monopoly in personal computer operating systems.
They are trying to persuade United States District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly to impose penalties that include forcing Microsoft to offer a version of Windows with removable features that could be customized by computer makers and rival software companies. The states have rejected a proposed settlement of the case that would allow computer makers to hide certain Windows features and promote competing products.
In testimony submitted to the judge on Tuesday, Mr. Murphy said the states' demands would help Microsoft's competitors rather than computer users. He supported the settlement Microsoft reached with the Justice Department in November that includes allowing computer makers to hide certain Windows features and promote rival software on the Windows desktop. 
Trying to cast doubt on Mr. Murphy's testimony, Mr. Kuney cited one of the Microsoft-financed papers in which he concluded that injecting competition into a monopolized market could lead to higher prices. In the paper, Mr. Murphy had written that under plausible conditions "entry into an initially monopolized market leads to higher prices for some, possibly all, consumers." 
Responding, Mr. Murphy said the comments applied to only one particular situation, in which the entry of a new competitor prompted a monopolist to reduce production. 
In other testimony, an executive at Autodesk, a software developer, warned that the remedies sought by the nine states would confuse computer users and raise the cost of software. 
Scott Borduin, Autodesk's chief technology officer, said the multiple versions of Windows envisioned under the states' demands would cause harm to software developers and computer users alike. 
"The testing costs associated with continuing at the current pace of innovation will be astronomical if Microsoft is forced to support multiple versions of each Windows operating system," he said in written testimony. Mr. Borduin also said software developers would be less likely to write software programs to an unstable or unpredictable operating system.

HEADLINE: Teamsters Union Protests at Coke Meeting 

BYLINE:  By GREG WINTER 

 BODY:
Accusing the Coca-Cola Company of "closing its eyes" to the intimidation, torture and assassination of union workers who bottle its drinks, the Teamsters union demanded yesterday that the company adopt and enforce strict labor standards for the manufacture of its products around the world.
 Standing beside a car-sized inflatable rat draped with the Coca-Cola logo in Manhattan, James P. Hoffa, the Teamsters president, accused the company of standing by and abdicating responsibility for the murder of eight union leaders who organized workers at Coke bottling plants in Colombia over the last decade, a charge the company vehemently denies. 
 With scores of fellow Teamsters crowding sidewalks outside Coke's annual shareholder meeting in Madison Square Garden, Mr. Hoffa asserted that workers at plants across the globe were "routinely harassed" by bottling companies that Coke refuses to rein in, and in some cases partly owns. 
One of the nation's largest unions, the Teamsters has supported strikes overseas and in the past has pressed companies to resolve labor disputes outside the United States. But this is the first time the union has sought to negotiate a global set of labor standards, covering every country in which a corporation operates.
"We're demanding Coke take control, or we will," Mr. Hoffa said, leading the crowd in a chant, "We're not going to take it anymore." 
Inside the meeting, the rally scarcely had an effect on the air of celebration. Charlie Rose was host of a virtual Academy Awards of the company's global influence, peppered with surprise appearances by Wynton Marsalis, Donald Sutherland, Jon Bon Jovi, Cal Ripken Jr. and Muhammad Ali. 
Still, Coke's chief executive, Douglas N. Daft, took care to deny the accusations and assure investors that the murders had nothing to do with the company, or the many bottlers that supply it. 
"Let me say briefly and quite pointedly: The claims against the company are simply not true," Mr. Daft said.
Not only does Coke adhere to international conventions that prohibit child labor and corporal punishment, Mr. Daft pointed out, but the company already has its own rigid principles for protecting workers, an expectation that extends to anyone who makes and bottles its drinks. 
Mr. Hoffa later dismissed the company's guidelines as largely voluntary, arguing that Coke rarely enforces them by cutting off bottlers who fail to live up to its standards. 
But in recent months, company officials countered, Coke has begun scrutinizing the companies that manufacture sodas in its name, in hopes of weeding out any objectionable labor practices. 
"No written code is enough; it's just words on paper, we know that," said Deval L. Patrick, the former head of the Justice Department's civil rights division who is now Coke's general counsel. "But we have taken the first steps, and they are important ones." 
Last July, a Colombian union sued Coke in a federal court in Miami, accusing the company and its Latin American subsidiaries of hiring paramilitary forces for the "systematic intimidation, kidnapping, detention and murder" of union workers in Colombia.
The suit does not directly accuse Coke executives in the United States of being involved in the plot. Instead, it contends that the actions took place "with the advance knowledge, acquiescence or subsequent ratification" of the company's employees in Colombia and its bottling partners whose "business exists solely at the pleasure of Coke." 
Infuriated by the allegations, Coke executives said that instead of protecting workers from further attacks, the lawsuit might only give rise to more violence. 
"It's not only false, it's reckless," said Rodrigo Calderon, a Coke spokesman based in Mexico. "By alleging that Coke is associated with the paramilitaries in suppressing union activity, it puts our executives in jeopardy."
Beyond rousing the Teamsters to demand an overhaul of the company's labor practices, the lawsuit also prompted a collection of Coke shareholders to seek new policies to protect workers. Their proposal called on the company to ensure that "its employees are treated fairly and paid a sustainable wage wherever they work in the global economy."
Given the company's existing policies, Coke officials described the proposal as redundant, and it was defeated at the shareholders' meeting by a margin of roughly nine to one.

HEADLINE: Chavez's Second Chance 

BYLINE:  By Jennifer McCoy; Jennifer McCoy is director of the Americas program at the Carter Center and a professor of political science at Georgia State University.

DATELINE: ATLANTA 

 BODY:
The Bush administration's mixed signals about last weekend's attempted coup in Venezuela -- first, as the administration reports, warning against it, then approving it when it happened and then backpedaling -- have given rise to charges that President Bush not only waffled but was not sufficiently firm about defending basic democratic values. But the confusion in Washington in many ways mirrored the confusion on the ground in Venezuela, where there were crossed signals and unclear intentions within the military, between the military and the opponents of President Hugo Chavez, and among the opposition groups themselves.
 The more immediate repudiation of the coup by the presidents of other Latin American democracies demonstrated a clearer resolve to defend legitimately elected governments. But Venezuela also illustrates how complex and difficult it can be in Latin America to improve the quality of democratic governance. 
 Venezuelans have failed to learn from their past. The traditional political and economic leaders who dominated Venezuelan democracy for 40 years have yet to absorb the lesson of their striking loss to Mr. Chavez at the polls in 1998. The public was tired of an ossified system in which a small circle of powerful politicians made the decisions and closed its eyes to the needs of its increasingly impoverished citizens.
In the absence of strong organized political parties, Venezuelan civic groups, unions and business organizations have emerged over the past two years as the main challengers to the Chavez government. But to some, the hubris of Pedro Carmona Estanga, the businessman named as interim president, and his circle as they narrowed their base and unexpectedly moved to dissolve the Congress seemed to demonstrate autocratic instincts as strong as those driving Mr. Chavez. The military and many of the groups that had allied with Mr. Carmona withdrew their support, allowing Mr. Chavez to return.
President Chavez has repeated the failed strategy of Venezuela's first attempt at democracy in 1945, when leaders alienated the Catholic Church, businesses and political parties while working for radical change. Those leaders were overthrown by a military coup three years later.
Venezuela has now had a close call, and both its own leaders and its neighbors should learn from it. Mr. Chavez must change his confrontational style and inflammatory rhetoric, which encouraged class polarization. His opponents must realize that to regroup politically, they have to offer constructive criticism and listen to the grievances of the poor. For the rest of the world, the coup shows that Latin American democracy is still fragile and needs international support.
The Organization of American States has the power to recommend actions to protect and strengthen the democratic process in a member country where democracy may be threatened. The O.A.S. should have acted more quickly, sending delegations as soon as there were signs that the Chavez regime was threatening the country's democratic system of checks and balances and the freedom of expression of its citizens. Mediation could have been offered as communication broke down between the government and its critics.
Now, to heal wounds and dispel mutual suspicions, international organizations like the O.A.S., the United Nations or private groups should offer help in organizing a credible investigation into last week's violence. And they should help Venezuelans develop new mechanisms for national dialogue, like roundtables now being used in Peru. These should bring together workers, businesses, the church, political parties, academia and other groups to discuss crucial national decisions and to restore Venezuelans' sense of a common destiny.

HEADLINE: Behind the Upheaval in Venezuela 

BYLINE:  By GINGER THOMPSON 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, April 17 

 BODY:
It was not just political differences that stirred Ramon Rodriguez to reject the coalition led by business leaders that forced President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela out of power briefly last week. It was the sight of them in the newspaper on Saturday.
 "All of them oligarchs," said Mr. Rodriguez, a street vendor, using the term by which the country's poor masses describe the wealthy white minority. "Couldn't they have appointed one person like us?" 
 Outraged, he went out to join the protesters who poured from the slums and tore through the streets to seize the national palace and put President Chavez back. Within 24 hours, Mr. Chavez resumed his presidency.
"If they rise up again," Mr. Rodriguez said, referring to the elite, "then we will rise again too."
The turmoil surrounding Mr. Chavez has exposed the deep social and racial rift in Venezuela between the upper and middle classes, who tend to be lighter skinned, and the poor majority. The brash president's turbulent political career has been driven by the entrenched polarization. 
A former army paratrooper from a poor family, he rose to power by seizing on the swelling discontent among Venezuela's poorest masses, promising to champion their causes against what he denounced as the corrupt forces of the old establishment. Although this is a country rich in oil and natural resources, some 80 percent of the people live in poverty.
Yet Mr. Chavez's opposition, while led by business executives, draws on an increasingly mobilized middle class of office workers, unionized laborers, even some military officers. They, too, have grown into a combative force. 
Mr. Chavez, with his tan skin and curly dark hair, embodies the racial mixture of Venezuela. Some 67 percent of the people here are mestizos, a mixed race of the whites, blacks and Indians who are the nation's minorities. Economic and political power, however, remains concentrated in the hands of whites. 
After he was restored to power, Mr. Chavez set aside his combative talk and said he would work for national reconciliation. But the depth of the social divisions, which Mr. Chavez himself has aggravated, makes political peacemaking difficult. 
Rather than working to mend the fractures in society, political experts said, Mr. Chavez exploited them to sustain his populist revolution. One result comes clear in the views of a street vendor and the rancorous, edgy or just plain exhausted expressions of others across the capital. 
An unemployed carpenter, Joise Perez, 31, compared the weekend of protests and looting by the proChavez demonstrators to rioting by African-Americans after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King. On the other hand, Lenin Guerrero, 18, a high-school student from a well-to-do family, compared the violence to the activities of the Ku Klux Klan.
A worker at a psychiatric hospital, Manzur Torre Alba, lamented that the rich looked down on him as "subhuman." A doctor, Pedro Baldallo, lamented equally indignantly that the poor called people like him "squalid ones," believing they were tainted by corruption.
Strolling with his family through a plaza in a wealthy neighborhood called Altamira, Rony Moscovitz, a businessman, said he felt alienated by the anticapitalist slogans of the Chavez government because he would like to see reforms that attract increased foreign investment and trade. 
After President Chavez appointed several of his allies to the board of the state-owned oil company, Mr. Moscovitz joined a march last week calling for the president's resignation. He insisted it was a "civilized, peaceful march," in contrast to the extensive looting over the weekend by pro-Chavez demonstrators. Even though Mr. Chavez is back in power, Mr. Moscovitz said, he still feels proud to have risen up against him.
As he spoke, the blaring horns of a passing caravan of pickup trucks broke the calm. The trucks were filled with Chavez supporters who waved Venezuelan flags and chanted, "He's back!"
"We have lost a battle," Mr. Moscovitz said. "But we have not lost the war." 
Calls for healing have come in from around the world in the wake of last week's turmoil. Today, Pope John Paul II urged Venezuelans to "ensure that a spirit of reconciliation prevails."
Cesar Gaviria, the president of the Organization of American States, said today that Venezuelans must find ways to live with one another or face renewed instability.
"There is a risk, probably not of another coup, but that social unrest will come again soon," he said. 
Most people have returned to their daily routines, but are still tense. The television broadcasts angry statements by pro-Chavez officials charging that he was forced out of power in a coup orchestrated by the elite. 
Opposition politicians declare that they will not recognize the authority of the Chavez government. People say they are going straight home after work, rather than dallying at malls, markets and restaurants.
At Mr. Rodriguez's bookstall in a neighborhood called Catia, shoppers seemed united in their support for Mr. Chavez and resentment toward those who supported his removal. They complained that the rich hoard their wealth and use little of it to generate jobs that pay decent salaries.
Mr. Chavez, they said, did not take power and forget the poor people who supported him. They said he had devoted government resources to low-cost housing and expanding public education.
"We are committed to him because he is committed to us," said Mr. Rodriguez, a thin, dark-skinned man whose cloudy eyes make him look older than his 44 years. "The rich people underestimated us."
To be sure, there were also measured voices coming from offices, social service centers and shopping plazas.
In a chic mall with sushi bars and Vietnamese restaurants where a meal costs a quarter of Venezuela's $40 monthly minimum salary, Corina Salas, 23, who works in a tourism agency and considers herself middle class, said she was exasperated by the lingering polarization. Rich and poor people have to find common ground, she said. 
"We know that if they don't get ahead," she said, referring to the poor, "we don't either."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: DIPLOMACY; 
POWELL ENDS TRIP; SEES NO CEASE-FIRE BEFORE A PULLOUT

BYLINE:  By JAMES BENNET with TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, April 17 

 BODY:
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell left Israel today without a hint of the cease-fire he came for, saying no truce could take hold as long as Israel resisted the Bush administration's call to withdraw from the Palestinian-controlled cities and towns that its forces have seized.
 With Secretary Powell's departure, the antagonists are if anything further apart -- angrier and more fearful of each other -- and with less ground for hope that even high-level American intervention could force a halt to violence by either side. 
 "Cease-fire is not a relevant term at the moment," Secretary Powell said at a news conference here, before departing for Cairo and then home. "But it will become relevant -- I believe very quickly -- when the incursion ends, when the withdrawals have been completed."
The secretary, who spent six days in the region without concrete result, had hard words for both Israel, insisting that its occupation must end, and for the Palestinians and their leader, Yasir Arafat, who he said must do more to renounce terrorism. 
He had earlier met Mr. Arafat for more than two hours in his battered compound in Ramallah, where the Palestinian has been under siege for 20 days.
Secretary Powell said Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel had given him "a pretty precise time line" for a withdrawal in coming days, but noted that Mr. Sharon still planned to raid Palestinian-controlled territory as he deemed necessary, and to station troops there as part of a "buffer zone" to protect Israelis.
"There are issues of going in and out and where troops will be stationed as they leave," Secretary Powell said. Israeli forces swept into two more West Bank villages today. 
While some Israeli officials expressed satisfaction with his trip, saying the secretary helped calm fighting along Israel's northern border, Palestinian officials bitterly assessed his mission as a failure, blaming Mr. Sharon for the outcome. "Secretary Powell leaves the situation much worse than he came," said Saeb Erekat, the Palestinians' chief negotiator. 
Arab nations expressed frustration that the United States had not put more pressure on Mr. Sharon.
At his stopover in Cairo, Secretary Powell found that one of the United States' staunchest Arab allies, President Hosni Mubarak, canceled a meeting, sending instead his foreign minister.
Despite the operation in the West Bank, which Mr. Sharon says is intended to net militants and their bomb-making operations, Israel anxiously marked its Independence Day today, in a state of high alert. 
As American-made warplanes and Apache helicopters paraded over Israeli cities to provide a patriotic show and, perhaps, reassurance, Israel continued to impose curfews, enforced by sniper fire, on entire Palestinian cities and to round up Palestinian men for questioning. 
Secretary Powell said President Bush was prepared to send George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence, back to the region to resume talks and to help the parties reach a cease-fire.
Part of Mr. Tenet's role would be to assess the ability of Palestinian security forces to crack down on violence -- an impossible task, American officials said, while the governing Palestinian Authority remained under Israeli fire.
Secretary Powell was the highest American official to meet with Mr. Arafat since the Israeli government declared the Palestinian leader irrelevant in December. After the talks today, Mr. Arafat said he was grateful for a "very, very warm, very important discussion."
But, speaking with reporters in a darkened foyer after the meeting, Mr. Arafat lashed out at Israel for its treatment of him and his people. "Is this acceptable, that I can't go outside from this door?" he asked, his voice rising. "Is this acceptable? For how long? Do you think this will not reflect in the whole stability and the peace in the Middle East?"
Mr. Sharon has called Mr. Arafat an enemy and ruled him out as a potential peace partner. Despite its own reservations, the Bush administration continues to regard him as the only Palestinian strong enough to secure a lasting agreement with Israel.
Secretary Powell and President Bush expressed disappointment with both sides today.
"Every leader, every state must choose between two separate paths -- the path of peace or the path of terror," Mr. Bush said at the Virginia Military Institute. "The Palestinian Authority must act -- must act -- on its words of condemnation against terror. Israel must continue its withdrawals, and all Arab states must step up to their responsibilities."
He added, "And all parties must say clearly that a murderer is not a martyr; he or she is just a murderer."
Secretary Powell said that the administration was exploring the idea of an international peace conference, but that no details had been worked out. 
Instead, he sketched what he called a "strategic framework" for an end to violence, followed by accelerated talks on a political solution and economic reconstruction for Palestinian society. He said the State Department's assistant secretary for Near Eastern affairs, William J. Burns, would remain in the region, and that he himself and the president's special envoy, Gen. Anthony C. Zinni, planned to return as well.
Palestinian officials suggested that the Bush administration was not speaking with one voice in its Middle East policy. Mr. Erekat noted that Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz, a leading hawk, had expressed support for Mr. Sharon at a rally by Jewish-Americans in Washington on Monday. Mr. Wolfowitz was also booed at the rally, for referring sympathetically to the Palestinians' plight.
"Look, when I saw Wolfowitz stand in Washington and say, 'I support Sharon,' while we were meeting with Secretary of State Powell, this told me something," Mr. Erekat said. "We do not have neon saying 'stupid' on our foreheads."
But Israelis, insisting that the 18-month-old conflict with the Palestinians did not menace the region, said Secretary Powell had dealt with a more dangerous matter, the northern border. There, the Lebanese group Hezbollah has been firing rockets and grenades into Israel, and Israel has reacted by sending fighter jets firing missiles.
"The northern border was the real tinderbox that could potentially lead to regional escalation," said Dore Gold, an adviser to Mr. Sharon.
In Jenin today, on the West Bank, the scene of the fiercest fighting of the recent operation, residents of the refugee camp began picking through the smashed homes in a search for the dead or buried alive. Relief workers also reported gaining limited access to the refugee camp, before Israeli forces abruptly returned and opened fire, scattering the camp's residents. No injuries were reported.
Secretary Powell said he was still seeking "a better understanding of the extent of damage and loss of life" in Jenin.
Once Israeli forces withdraw from Jenin, Nablus and other towns and cities, Israeli officials said, they will take up positions encircling and blockading them. The measure is necessary, the officials said, to prevent terrorist attacks.
Overnight Tuesday, Israel took the very unusual step of imposing a curfew in Jerusalem itself, in the Arab neighborhood of Issawiyah, as the police searched for two suspected terrorists, the police said. They pulled some residents out of their houses and prevented others who arrived while the curfew was in place from returning to their homes. 
The curfew ended, after more than 16 hours, at 11 this morning, the police said. Two suspects accused of aiding the wanted men were taken into custody, said Gil Kleiman, a police spokesman.
Secretary Powell acknowledged that after the withdrawal from other areas, Israeli forces were likely to remain around Mr. Arafat's compound in Ramallah and around the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem.
Mr. Sharon says Mr. Arafat is hiding the killers of Israel's tourism minister, slain in a Jerusalem hotel in October. But Palestinian officials say the men are imprisoned, and that, by agreement, neither side has to turn over suspects sought by the other as long as they remain jailed.
"We are trying to find ways to resolve this difficult choice between the two," Secretary Powell said. "And it has become the most difficult problem with respect to resolving this whole situation."
The second siege is of some 250 Palestinians, including perhaps 30 gunmen, inside the Church of the Nativity. Mr. Sharon has offered the wanted men inside a choice of Israeli trial or exile, but so far no one has accepted the deal. Secretary Powell said Mr. Sharon "said that he would not assault into that holy place, although we saw there was a firefight of some kind last night that caused some damage, and that's troubling." 
In Bethlehem today, streets and alleys were all but deserted as the Israeli Army used armored patrols and soldiers on foot to seal the area around Manger Square. Bethlehem stank of the refuse that has piled up during more than two weeks of Israeli control of the city. 
Tonight, brief bursts of rifle fire sounded from the square, as they have intermittently since the siege began. One resident seethed as the shots reverberated outside his home. 
"They are saying, 'We are here, don't walk in the streets,' " said the man, Hamide. He said that except for a few hours two days ago, when he went to search for food, he had been confined to his home for two weeks.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE PRESIDENT; 
Bush Sets Role for U.S. in Afghan Rebuilding

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: LEXINGTON, Va., April 17 

 BODY:
President Bush today embraced a major American role in rebuilding Afghanistan, calling for a plan he compared to the one Gen. George C. Marshall devised for Europe after World War II, and vowed to keep the United States engaged in Afghanistan "until the mission is done."
 Speaking before cadets at the Virginia Military Institute, Mr. Bush warned that military force alone could not bring "true peace" to Afghanistan, and that stability would come only after the war-ravaged country reconstructed its roads, health care system, schools and businesses -- just as Europe and Japan did after 1945. 
 "We know that true peace will only be achieved when we give the Afghan people the means to achieve their own aspirations," Mr. Bush said. "Peace will be achieved by helping Afghanistan develop its own stable government. Peace will be achieved by helping Afghanistan train and develop its own national army. And peace will be achieved through an education system for boys and girls which works."
Mr. Bush cast the mission in moral terms and did not say what kinds of resources the United States was prepared to devote to the task -- or how deeply the American military would be involved. But he made clear that the United States was ready to lead an international effort, repeatedly invoking the name of General Marshall, who graduated from V.M.I. in 1901 and was President Harry S. Truman's secretary of state after World War II.
There would certainly be a difference in scale between the Marshall Plan and anything the United States did in Afghanistan. The United States spent about $13 billion on the Marshall Plan, nearly $90 billion in today's dollars, to help 17 Western European nations rebuild their agricultural production and industrial bases. The United Nations has projected that Afghanistan will need $15 billion to rebuild over the next decade.
In his wide-ranging address, Mr. Bush also renewed his warnings that "outlaw nations" with "mad ambitions," like Iraq and North Korea, were trying to develop weapons of mass destruction and must be countered. He urged the Palestinian Authority and leaders of Arab nations to denounce terrorism and rein in the militant groups within their borders that support it.
"All parties have a responsibility to stop funding or inciting terror," he said. "And all parties must say clearly that a murderer is not a martyr."
In his comments about Afghanistan, Mr. Bush seemed to complete a reversal of policy that began six months ago with the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington and the American military response in Afghanistan. 
During the 2000 presidential campaign, Mr. Bush dismissed the Clinton administration's efforts in Somalia and the Balkans as "nation building" and rejected proposals by Vice President Al Gore for a Marshall-like plan to rebuild the Balkans. Mr. Bush said such reconstruction programs were not a proper role for the American military.
But today the president repeatedly described General Marshall's efforts in Europe as a model for Afghanistan, proposing a long-term commitment that would extend far beyond the battlefield and into projects like paving roads, clearing minefields, building clinics and contributing to economic development.
"By helping to build an Afghanistan that is free from this evil and is a better place in which to live, we are working in the best traditions of George Marshall," Mr. Bush said. "Marshall knew that our military victory in World War II had to be followed by a moral victory that resulted in better lives for individual human beings."
Hours after Mr. Bush's speech, however, Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld made it clear at a Pentagon briefing that the president did not envision using American forces as part of a peacekeeping force in Afghanistan. He noted that while many nations have contributed to such an international force, neither Britain, which currently leads the force, nor Turkey, which is expected to take over that role, wanted to expand it beyond the capital, Kabul.
"If the International Security Assistance Force wants to be expanded, fine," Mr. Rumsfeld said. "If it wants to go to other countries, fine. Who's going to lead it? Who's going to pay for it?"
During the occupations of Germany and Japan, which Mr. Bush referred to in his speech, American forces were deployed in both nations.
The Marshall Plan's objective was to revitalize Europe as a way of nurturing democratic institutions and preventing the spread of Communism. For Mr. Bush, the goal is to stabilize Afghanistan to prevent the spread of Islamic militancy and terrorism, a process he said could take years.
"As the spring thaw comes, we expect cells of trained killers to try to regroup, to murder, create mayhem and try to undermine Afghanistan's efforts to build a lasting peace," Mr. Bush said. 
"We know this from not only intelligence, but from the history of military conflict in Afghanistan," he added. "It's been one of initial success, followed by long years of floundering and ultimate failure. We're not going to repeat that mistake."
Speaking a few hours after Secretary of State Colin L. Powell left Israel, Mr. Bush also praised Secretary Powell's efforts to restart peace talks in the Middle East, saying, "He returns home having made progress towards peace."
But the president also called on both sides in the conflict to do much more to defuse the crisis. He urged the Israelis to continue their withdrawals from the West Bank and the Palestinian Authority to follow through on Yasir Arafat's condemnation of attacks against civilians. 
Mr. Bush, who is scheduled to meet with Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia next Wednesday, also pointedly urged Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia to "help confront terrorism in the Middle East."
"All parties have a responsibility to stop funding or inciting terror," he said.
Mr. Bush opened his speech by asserting that the United States was making progress against terror on many fronts, offering as evidence the capture of a top leader of Al Qaeda, Abu Zabaydah, in Pakistan last month.
"He's not plotting and he's not planning anymore," Mr. Bush said to loud applause from the cadets and their families seated on the bleachers of the college gymnasium. "He's under lock and key and we're going to give him some company."

HEADLINE: Fed Chairman Sees No Need To Raise Rates Right Away 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 17 

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said today that he was in no rush to raise interest rates because he wanted to take more time to assess the strength and sustainability of the economic recovery.
 Testifying to Congress's Joint Economic Committee, Mr. Greenspan was unusually clear in signaling his intentions, saying that rates will have to rise eventually but that he does not want to begin taking back last year's rate cuts until he is sure the economy will continue growing at a reasonable pace. 
 Investors and economists interpreted him to mean that the Fed would hold rates steady at its next meeting, on May 7, and maybe at the subsequent meeting, on June 25-26, as well. They said the most probable course now is for the Fed to begin tightening monetary policy at its meeting in August. 
The central bank cut rates 11 times last year as it responded to the first recession in a decade and the economic aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Its benchmark federal funds target rate on overnight loans among banks stands at 1.75 percent, a 40-year low.
Mr. Greenspan said there was little threat from inflation, giving the Fed the luxury of being patient. In the long run, he said, the odds are that the economy will firmly return, pushing unemployment back down and allowing companies to rebuild their depressed profit margins.
At the same time, he said, the economy faces a number of risks in the short run. Among them is the possibility of an economic stall if businesses that had been whittling their inventories of unsold goods last year stop rebuilding their supplies in warehouses and stores.
Mr. Greenspan also cited the risk of higher oil prices and signs that consumer spending could be held back by rising levels of personal debt. He said the economic picture should become much clearer over the next two to four months.
"To be sure, over time, the current accommodative stance of monetary policy is not likely to be consistent with maintaining price stability," Mr. Greenspan said. "But prospects for low inflation and inflation expectations in the period ahead mean the Federal Reserve should have ample opportunity to adjust policy to keep inflation pressures contained once sustained, solid economic expansion is in view."
Mr. Greenspan said that the economy showed tremendous resilience the last six months. He alluded to a spate of positive statistics, including evidence that the nation's employers were adding jobs again, that the long slump in manufacturing might have bottomed and that growth in productivity -- or the efficiency of business -- remained remarkably strong.
"But the strength of the economic expansion that is under way remains to be clarified," he said. "Some of the forces that have weighed heavily on the economy over the past year or so have begun to dissipate, but other factors, such as the sharp increase in world oil prices, have arisen that pose new challenges."
On Wall Street, stock prices rose somewhat after Mr. Greenspan's testimony but then fell back. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 10,220.78, down 80.54 points. The Nasdaq composite index fell 6.12 points, to 1,810.67. Prices on many government bonds also fell.
"The Fed is in no rush to tighten policy," said a report from Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch. "We expect a healthy recovery and believe the Fed will start tightening sometime this summer, with action likely in August."
In signaling his willingness to hold interest rates at historical lows even as the economy recovers, Mr. Greenspan displayed in full the flexibility he has brought to monetary policy in recent years. 
Once viewed as an inflation hawk willing to sacrifice jobs to squelch any hint of inflation, he has again proved himself willing to bet on the economy's ability to produce growth and jobs without creating the kind of inflation pressures predicted by traditional economic models.
His ability to do so stems in part from the credibility he has earned in the financial markets as an inflation fighter; the bond market has not pushed long-term interest rates much higher precisely because investors are convinced that Mr. Greenspan will act aggressively to contain rising prices should any inflation pressure appear.
But it is also rooted in the remarkable turnaround in the growth rate of productivity, or output per hour, which is the most basic determinant of the economy's ability to expand without generating inflation.
Although he warned that the figures were sure to tail off soon, Mr. Greenspan marveled today that productivity -- which normally slows to a crawl in an economic downturn -- grew at a torrid 5.5 percent annual rate in last year's fourth quarter and seems to have posted another strong performance in the first three months of this year.
Mr. Greenspan's flexible approach could bring many benefits, but it also holds risks that the economy may overheat or that it could lay the foundation for another stock market bubble of the sort the Fed confronted in the late 1990's.
With the Fed in the midst of a gradual shift from cutting rates to tightening them, the Bush administration appeared close to settling on candidates to fill two empty seats on the bank's board of governors. 
One seat seems likely to be going to Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the economics department at Princeton, who is an authority on monetary policy, people close to the administration's search said. Mr. Bernanke, who met with President Bush at the White House this afternoon, did not return a call to his office.
It is unclear who will be nominated to the other seat; the administration has looked at a variety of people, including Wall Street economists and officials within the Federal Reserve.

HEADLINE: Man in the News; 
Combative Point Man on Latin Policy -- Otto J. Reich

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 17 

 BODY:
Watching the Bush administration struggle to respond to recent events in Venezuela, some critics have judged that it was too quick to accept reports of the resignation of President Hugo Chavez and too slow to defend the democratic system that elected him.
 The administration's performance, said Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, cried out for "more adult supervision." 
 Today, the chief policy maker for Latin America, Otto J. Reich, came back swinging. "We have reviewed our actions since last Thursday," he said. "I find very little that I would do differently." 
Such is the confidence of Mr. Reich, a former ambassador to Venezuela whose conservative credentials and combative demeanor have made him popular among Republicans but have stirred the suspicions of Democrats. 
After a few short months, Mr. Reich is facing his second crisis in Latin America. The first was the collapse of the Argentine economy, to which he has taken a hands-off approach. He is thoughtful and meticulous with experience in the region as a development agency official, diplomat and businessman.
He is also a fierce partisan who cedes little ground to his opponents, particularly those who fail to share his concern over the threats posed by President Fidel Castro of Cuba and, more recently, by Mr. Chavez, who has built close ties with Mr. Castro.
In January, after Senate Democrats denied Mr. Reich a hearing on the Latin policy post and refused to confirm him, President Bush granted him a recess appointment, which allows him to serve until the end of the Congressional session -- and beyond, if reappointed.
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell fully backs Mr. Reich, said the secretary's spokesman, Philip Reeker, calling him a "key player."
Mr. Reich asserts that it was Mr. Dodd who blocked his Senate access; he accuses the senator and his staff of "character assassination." 
A spokesman for Mr. Dodd, Marvin Fast, responded: "This isn't about character assassination. This is about competence."
Some of the animus toward Mr. Reich stems from his involvement in what became known as the Iran-contra scandal in the Reagan administration. As director of the State Department's Office of Public Diplomacy, Mr. Reich tried to influence public opinion in support of the Nicaraguan contras, the General Accounting Office found, by resorting to "prohibited covert propaganda" like preparing newspaper opinion articles for pro-contra authors.
Mr. Reich has denied wrongdoing and was never charged. Recently, in his first major policy speech as assistant secretary, he made light of the controversy, greeting the "former colleagues" and "unindicted co-conspirators" in the crowd. Then he complained, "That was supposed to get a better laugh." 
Otto Juan Reich was born in 1945 in Cuba, which he fled as a teenager. He thrived in his adoptive country, earning a bachelor's degree at the University of North Carolina and a master's in Latin American studies at Georgetown. 
His uncompromising views on Cuba have made him a pillar of support for the four-decades-old American trade embargo. His appointment was championed by Cuban exiles, who supported Mr. Bush's presidential campaign, and was viewed as a setback by advocates for more open contacts with Havana. He has criticized corruption in Latin America and promoted free trade.
When the crisis flared up in Venezuela, Mr. Reich, who has made no secret of his disdain for President Chavez, was ready to respond. He had been the Venezuela envoy in the late 80's. After that, as a lobbyist, he numbered among his clients Mobil Oil, which has interests in Venezuela.
"My entire life I've done things that have prepared me for this job," Mr. Reich said in an interview today.
Recounting the events surrounding the two-day Chavez ouster, Mr. Reich asserted that the administration had had no involvement or knowledge -- indeed had been operating under an "information blackout" in the first hours of the revolt last Thursday. 
He defended his decision on Friday to establish contact with Pedro Carmona Estanga, the business leader who sought to replace Mr. Chavez. He said the administration would have been criticized even more harshly had it failed to warn Mr. Carmona of its desire to see democratic processes respected.
"I think it would be irresponsible not to do it," Mr. Reich said.
Mr. Reich, who says he loves his job, said it was Mr. Chavez who should reflect on how things might have been handled differently. He said Mr. Chavez's contrite remarks and call for understanding on Sunday were a start. "We were really trying to avoid, first, a civil war, or, second, the end of Venezuelan democracy," Mr. Reich said. "Considering all the things that could have happened, it didn't end badly."

HEADLINE: BLOOMBERG WARNS OF BIG CUTBACKS IN CITY'S SERVICES 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg warned yesterday that the city faced layoffs and fewer garbage pickups, fewer police officers and less money for its schools if, as now seems increasingly likely, the city did not get all the help he sought from the state and federal governments and city unions.
 The city's budget deficit has grown to nearly $5 billion for the fiscal year beginning July 1, the mayor said yesterday as he presented his executive budget plan. His plan to close that gap relies in part on $1.3 billion in savings that would require legislation in Albany or Washington or concessions from city unions. But with almost none of that legislation passed, and no deals with the unions to speak of, Mr. Bloomberg released a backup plan with half a billion dollars in further service cuts. 
 The mayor said the contingency plan would be "onerous." 
It calls for eliminating fire companies from eight firehouses that currently hold two, shrinking the Police Department by delaying the hiring of its next class, scaling back garbage pickups, raising the fare on express buses to $4 from $3, closing 15 more centers for the elderly, eliminating medical services in homeless shelters, eliminating some youth programs and cutting a further $115 million from the Board of Education.
Many budget watchdogs have questioned the likelihood that Mr. Bloomberg will get $1.3 billion from state and federal actions and union givebacks since he first outlined his original budget proposal in February. But the mayor continued to hold out hope yesterday that his requests would be granted.
"If we get the help that we've asked for, if our projections on revenues and how efficient we can run government are correct, we will never have to implement any of these," Mr. Bloomberg said. "But prudence requires us to tell people what would happen if. And so when you write the story of the contingency plans being very onerous, yes they are. But our expectation and our hope, and if everybody cooperates and we're a little bit lucky, we will never get to that point."
It was a sober, even somber budget presentation that Mr. Bloomberg made in City Hall yesterday. He used words like "scary" and "worrisome" as he gave a PowerPoint presentation outlining the city's climbing expenses and falling revenues, and the effects that the recession and the World Trade Center attack have had on the local economy.
Once again, he set a philosophical budgetary stance that was far different from the City Council's. He sternly, albeit politely, rejected the Council's proposals to increase several taxes, saying that it would never get permission from the State Legislature to do so, especially in an election year. His pledge of no new taxes, with the exception of a higher cigarette tax, laid the battleground for negotiations with the Council, which must pass a budget in June. 
In outlining his budget plan, as he is required to do each April, Mr. Bloomberg was speaking to several very different, but important, constituencies. To the bond rating agencies, whose approval or censure can save or cost the city hundreds of millions of dollars when it borrows money, he was trying to appear fiscally responsible. To Albany and Washington, he was painting a bleak picture of the contingency cuts that would be needed if lawmakers did not cooperate.
To the labor unions, from whom he is seeking $500 million in concessions, the mayor said that the choice should be clear: agree to back the city's plan to stretch out its payments to the pension funds, and make concessions on fringe benefits, or face layoffs. "The alternatives are the contingency cuts, and the contingency cuts include layoffs," Mr. Bloomberg said.
His contingency plan identifies 2,600 positions that would be cut, largely through attrition, and calls for $64.9 million more in unspecified "head count cuts." Neither Mr. Bloomberg nor his budget director, Mark Page, would say how many positions would be cut under the plan. But the Independent Budget Office, a nonpartisan city agency that monitors the budget, estimated that the city would have to cut 2,500 to 3,000 more positions to save that much. If carried out, those changes would remove 5,100 to 5,600 positions from the city's work force of roughly 250,000 to 300,000, depending on how part-time workers are counted.
Lillian Roberts, the executive director of District Council 37, the city's largest municipal union, said in a statement that the union had no comment on the mayor's plan, but would make its own proposal to him shortly.
To the City Council, the mayor issued a warning of sorts: pass a responsible, balanced budget, or face the risk that the city could be taken over by a financial control board, as it was during the fiscal crisis of 1975. When that happened, he noted, the board cut 64,000 jobs, including about one-fifth of the work force at the Police Department, the Fire Department and the Board of Education. 
His remarks drew a sharp response from the speaker of the Council, Gifford Miller, who had been talking in recent days about negotiating a budget with the mayor. Yesterday, Mr. Miller pointedly left open the possibility that the Council would pass its own. "If we're unable to work out differences of opinion, of course we'll pass our own budget," he said.
The City Council has very different ideas about the budget. It wants to restore many proposed cuts, especially to education. It is also seeking a surcharge on the personal income tax to pay for new schools, and the reinstatement of the commuter tax on people who work in the city but live elsewhere. 
Mr. Bloomberg has said he will veto any budget passed by the Council that includes other tax increases, which he frequently says could drive businesses and families from the city. 
The mayor said that the budget gap grew nearly a quarter of a billion dollars largely because the city had identified more likely expenses, including higher overtime costs, higher debt payments as interests rates begin to rise again, and money to pay for raises at the City University of New York.
Tax revenues are actually a bit better than expected, as the city's economy begins to recover. But the city stands to lose $128 million because of a recent federal tax cut in the economic stimulus package, since the city taxes are calculated based on federal taxes. The city is seeking permission from Albany to calculate its taxes differently.
Mr. Bloomberg noted that many of the state and federal actions that he is seeking, for a total of $800 million, would cost Albany and Washington no money. He is looking to Albany to allow the city to increase the cigarette tax and parking violation fines and refinance its debt at more favorable rates, among other things. 
But Albany has its own problems: yesterday was the 17th day that the state budget was late, and city officials said they did not expect the state to take any actions for the city until it passed its own budget. 
The federal government has given the city permission to refinance its debt, for a $150 million savings. Now the city wants more flexibility in how it spends federal aid that it already receives, and is seeking a higher share of domestic security money, more money for Medicaid, and more money to offset the cost it incurs to protect foreign dignitaries.
Although the mayor remained optimistic, budget analysts were not so sure. A budget report by City Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr. cautioned that the city's "package of federal and state actions includes many actions that may not occur." One by State Comptroller H. Carl McCall said, "While the city may ultimately receive some of these resources, there could be a significant shortfall." A report by the Independent Budget Office called the proposals uncertain.
Hence the contingency plan. Fire Commissioner Nicholas Scoppetta called the cuts in the plan "extremely troublesome." The Citizens' Committee for Children warned that the cuts to schools, libraries and recreational facilities would affect every child in the city. Advocates for the homeless warned that if the city cut cleaning services at its shelters, they would be less appealing, and more homeless people would stay on the streets.
The mayor held out hope that the contingency plan would not be needed. 
"Do I think, realistically, we will ever get to these cuts?" he said. "I hope not, but I've got to keep making the case because, at the moment, we don't have the monies from Albany, most of the money from Washington or any of the money from the unions. But it's at the beginning of the process and I think everybody, when they take a look at how onerous the contingency cuts would be, and the unthinkable of having the Financial Control Board run this city, that they will be there when we need them."

B6) Chart: "LEDGER: Plan B: More Cuts"Some of the items on the mayor's plan to balance the budget require approval outside the city's control.

HEADLINE: Cuomo's Criticism of Pataki's Role After 9/11 Sets Off Furor 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: BUFFALO, April 17 

 BODY:
Andrew M. Cuomo said today that Gov. George E. Pataki did not deserve credit for leading New York through the difficult weeks after the World Trade Center attack, declaring that he had merely "held a leader's coat" as he stood at the side of Rudolph W. Giuliani last fall.
 "There was one leader for 9/11: it was Rudy Giuliani," Mr. Cuomo, the Democratic gubernatorial candidate, told reporters on his campaign bus on the way here from Utica. "If it defined George Pataki, it defined George Pataki as not being the leader. 
 "He stood behind the leader," Mr. Cuomo continued, leaning forward in a black leather chair as his bus rumbled along the New York State Thruway. "He held the leader's coat. He was a great assistant to the leader. But he was not a leader."
Mr. Cuomo's remarks, in the midst of a freewheeling interview with reporters about his campaign on the second day of a four-day trip around New York to advance his candidacy, startled some politicians, given the passions stirred by the topic. It also enlivened Republicans, who noted the popularity of Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Pataki, and who seized on what they clearly viewed as a misstep. Rarely has the Sept. 11 attack been invoked to discredit a political opponent.
Mr. Giuliani quickly defended his fellow Republican, stating in an interview that Mr. Pataki was a "total partner" in managing New York's response to the attack. "I held his coat as often as he held mine," Mr. Giuliani said. "We were inseparable."
Mr. Giuliani, who had a strained relationship with Mr. Pataki for years after endorsing Mr. Cuomo's father, Mario, for re-election over Mr. Pataki in 1994, argued that Andrew Cuomo was introducing partisanship into a chapter of New York's history that had been largely free of such entanglements, and suggested Mr. Cuomo's attack "plays right into the governor's hands."
"If he fights the campaign with this strategy, George Pataki should win unanimously," Mr. Giuliani said. "I don't get it."
In Albany, Mr. Pataki responded: "I'm just stunned by the comments. There are things I could say. I don't think it's appropriate. I think it's just very sad."
Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate Republican leader, who was appearing with Mr. Pataki at an unrelated news conference, said Mr. Cuomo "ought to be ashamed of himself," adding: "Everyone knows he tends to be overaggressive, but when you talk about leadership, leadership also means being contained, being restrained, doing something really meaningful and not just grandstanding."
In the days after the attack, Mr. Pataki was a near-constant presence at Mr. Giuliani's side. But he frequently stood at the side of the stage, as Mr. Giuliani took the lead role in managing the city through the crisis.
Mr. Cuomo drew the contrast between the two men as he sought to dispel the notion that Mr. Pataki's re-election had been enhanced given his identification with New York's response to Sept. 11. In fact, Mr. Cuomo argued, Mr. Pataki had failed to rise to the biggest challenge of his career.
"During 9/11, Rudy Giuliani was the leader," Mr. Cuomo said. "I think George Pataki could have been. He was the governor. The governor is bigger than the mayor. By the way: if Bill Clinton were president of the United States, who would have been in charge of 9/11? Bill Clinton. Why? Because he's a leader."
"You know cream rises to the top," Mr. Cuomo said. "And Rudy Giuliani rose to the top."
As Mr. Cuomo spoke, his wife, Kerry Kennedy Cuomo, sitting in a seat across from him, nodded in agreement, arguing that Mr. Pataki's response was emblematic of his performance as governor. "It is reflective of his lack of leadership across the state," she said.
"I think that's exactly right," Mr. Cuomo said.
By all appearances, Mr. Cuomo did not seem to have set out today to have made an issue of Mr. Pataki's handling of the attack. He released a report in Utica this morning offering statistics he said documented the economic problem upstate, terming it "The Pataki Depression." He proposed a state tax credit for companies that create jobs upstate.
Mr. Cuomo offered his criticism of Mr. Pataki to a group of newspaper reporters. There were no television cameras present, so there is no video record of Mr. Cuomo's remarks. That means that the Republicans will find it difficult to turn his statement into a television advertisement, as might otherwise have been likely.
Still, Republicans and advisers to Mr. Pataki made little effort to hide their glee as they learned of what Mr. Cuomo had said. As Mr. Bruno was leaving the news conference with Mr. Pataki, Michael McKeon, the governor's press secretary, patted him enthusiastically on the back, and said: "Thank you."
Mr. Cuomo rejected the suggestion that he was trying to use the terrorist attack for political advantage. He noted the stream of public officials who had toured ground zero over the past seven months, and added: "And now, when Andrew is talking, it's political. It doesn't mean anything."
Mr. Cuomo said, after a rally here tonight, that he did not view public polls in which Mr. Pataki enjoys a high approval rating as a sign that most New Yorkers applaud the job the governor has done since last fall.
"This is a time of national crisis," he said. 'And people instinctively rally together; and I think that is what you see in the polls."
Mr. Cuomo repeatedly criticized the slow pace of planning rebuilding at the trade center site, suggesting that it would have moved more briskly were Mr. Giuliani still on the scene. Mr. Cuomo said that was one of the main factors he was taking into account in drawing the negative contrast between the current governor and the former mayor.

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE REVIEW; 
A Gift Of Vienna That Skips The Schlag

BYLINE:  By HERBERT MUSCHAMP 

 BODY:
IN architecture, the history of ideas is more reliable than the history of forms. It was almost worth suffering through postmodernism to absorb this simple lesson. Visually similar forms can convey appreciably different meanings. Not all glass elevations deliver the same message as that presented by the landmarks of the International Style. In the case of the new Austrian Cultural Forum, at 11 East 52nd Street in Manhattan, the message is quite contrary. In contrast to the lucid rationality of the modern glass tower, the forum projects the idea that serious disturbances may lie beneath a relatively smooth appearance. Call this a psycho-building: every skyline goes a little crazy sometimes.
 Designed by the Austrian-born New York architect Raimund Abraham, the forum has been a long time in gestation. Mr. Abraham's design was chosen in 1992 from 226 entries in a blind competition. (The jurors included Richard Meier, Charles Gwathmey, Kenneth Frampton and Hermann Czech.) His design was presented in New York the following year at the Museum of Modern Art. Thereafter, the building became the subject of prolonged debate among Austrian government officials in what amounted to a referendum on national identity. For a cultural showcase abroad, should Austria project an image of reassurance, an architectural equivalent of Old World charm, or ally itself with the astringent side of the Viennese soul? 
 Perhaps the delay was beneficial. New York is hungrier than it was 10 years ago for architecture of this caliber, and better primed to appreciate its urbanity and depth. More important, this city has become aware of its stake in the living tradition of modern architecture. There may be many out there who still believe that New York would be happier if all traces of modernity could be removed from the cityscape, but I suspect that such people are in retreat. As citizens of the Enlightenment, our deepest cultural roots are still planted in modern soil.
Mr. Abraham's design is a gateway into the tradition of modernity associated with Vienna at the turn of the last century. It is a complicated tradition, filled with contradiction, rage and high anxiety about the modern city and the forms it should take. Those who find the Abraham design too aggressive should keep in mind that antagonism toward the city is heartily Viennese.
Today, we can visit Vienna and eat pastries in the coffee shops frequented by Freud, Loos, Kokoschka. But what did those guys talk about? They spent much of their time ranting about how much they hated Vienna. Their hatred was genuine. But that was also the manner in which they expressed their love. The Austrian Cultural Forum arrives at a moment when many New Yorkers can easily identify with that old Viennese ambivalence. We sincerely hate a great deal about New York right now. We feel alienated by the city's conversion from a place of production to one increasingly geared to the economy of mass consumption. We despise the great leveling of cultural ambition created by catering to the mass audience with empty spectacles.
In architecture, we go bananas when asked to accept that "appropriateness" and "contextualism" are somehow less aggressive or tyrannical than the rigid application of early 20th-century Modernist dogma. We wonder if recovery from the Giuliani era's suppression of civil discourse will ever be possible.
Yet, of course, we wouldn't dream of living anywhere else because, first of all, it's our town. Also because New York remains the world's great beacon of opportunity. And finally, because it's our job to pass on an even more open and energetic city than the one that took us in.
The forum is a 24-story sliver tower, a mere 25 feet wide. Viewed head on, the building appears compressed between the wider structures that flank its midblock site. Diagonal steel braces, visible behind the glass skin, stabilize the structure against wind. But the braces also appear to exert pressure outside, as if the tower were using its neighbors for resistance in an isometric exercise. The building's structure is concrete. Mr. Abraham has divided it, front to back, into three vertical parts. The parts bear names. The glass facade is "the mask." Beyond that is "the core," containing the main structural elements and enclosed spaces. To the rear of the building are "the vertebrae," an exterior circulation spine formed by a double fire stair of poured concrete.
The mask is the most visible segment. Cantilevered from the structural core, it features four sloping louvers of bladelike glass framed with dull gray zinc. A zinc-sheathed concrete box containing the director's office projects beyond the louvers; a glass-enclosed library is positioned just beneath. The glass does not convey lightness or transparency. A heavy glass, heavily tinted, it presents a materiality akin to masonry. It is not made for shattering into photogenic smithereens, but for breaking the bones of anyone stupid enough to try to smash it.
Mr. Abraham himself has likened the facade to the blade of a guillotine: the glass louvers slice slivers of sky. Others have seen a resemblance to a metronome, or to an Easter Island monolith. We mustn't be afraid of such metaphors. Mr. Abraham considers himself a symbolist. The wonder is that he is able to coax symbolism out of functional necessities, like the need for external egress and conformance to the legal zoning envelope.
Public spaces are on the ground and lower levels. Forms and materials are tough, but the circulation flow is graceful. From beneath the sidewalk canopy, one progresses through lobby and galleries in a seamless loop. A skylight at the rear of the base draws the eye forward and allows a worm's-eye view of the vertebrae stairs, switch-backing skyward.
A mezzanine level leads to a small auditorium with a miniature balcony and a teeny-tiny cafe just outside. Upstairs are a duplex library, meeting rooms, offices and the director's private residence. These interiors enable visitors to appreciate the organic quality of the entire building. Like the American Folk Art Museum, completed last year, the design integrates structure, form, space and circulation into a united whole.
There is thus a Viennese perversity in Mr. Abraham's calling his facade "the mask." Compared with many postmodern skyscrapers, snappy building skins held together by who knows what kind of thingummy inside, the forum is the soul of integrity. Yet it does not represent itself publicly as Truth. It is a disguise, beneath which we may uncover the mechanisms with which our own multiple disguises are manufactured. 
The forum is the second major venue for Austrian art to open in New York in the last five months. Farther uptown, the Neue Galerie has rekindled interest in the Viennese Modern tradition. Is something going on? Well, yes. Since the end of the Cold War, it has become increasingly clear that Vienna, past and present, has a pivotal role to play in developing a new cosmopolitan outlook.
The forum's programs, which will focus on contemporary work in literature, fine art, music, architecture and film, are part of this development. And the building itself should encourage visitors to dig deeper into the historical terrain of Viennese Modernism. Many will find themselves on oddly familiar ground. The building's capacity to operate on a deeply symbolic level, for example, draws on Viennese sources that have become part of the air we breathe.
For example, it happens that the forum's director, Christoph Thun-Hohenstein, bears the family name of an Austrian count who turned up one night in Freud's dreams, where he inadvertently helped induce the birth of psychoanalysis. Every student of psychoanalysis knows the so-called "Revolutionary Dream." It is integral to the history of 20th-century thought. (Freud recounts the dream in Chapter 5 of "The Interpretation of Dreams.") 
But the circumstances preceding the dream are worth noting here. In August 1893, Freud was waiting on a railway platform for a train bound for Aussee, his summer vacation spot. As he looked on, Count Franz Anton Thun arrived at the station, swept onto the platform, brushed the ticket taker aside and commandeered a compartment as if it were his private carriage. Count Thun, a high government official, was on his way to see the emperor.
After his train pulled out, Freud found himself humming an aria from Mozart's "Marriage of Figaro." "If the count wishes to dance a step, I will call the tune," the libretto reads in one translation. Figaro's mocking of the aristocracy, Freud knew, was what caused the original Beaumarchais play to be banned by Louis XVI in 1778. And Freud's recounting of the affair invites us to see him as Figaro, a figure who toppled the established social order and ultimately "called the tune" for the modern intelligentsia.
And so, by a coincidence of fate, a Thun is living within a beautiful building designed by an architect who has shown equal disobedience to the elaborate rigmaroles of the status quo. "It seems to project beyond the street wall," an official of a local civic group sniffed when the forum was on the rise, as if all right-minded people would naturally condemn such churlish behavior.
In fact, Mr. Abraham has reconnected New York to a tradition that once played a greater role in our architecture than it does today. Here we encounter the idea that patrons should serve culture, not the other way around. Power should serve imagination. Society should hold artists responsible for revealing their authentic selves, not for conforming to its own conventions.
An architect has reasserted the right to make architecture, and this turns out to be completely O.K. It has been a long time since a New York building served this idea with such confidence and distinction. The building's lessons are philosophical rather than formal. I think of it as "the wedge," because it invites New York to reacquaint itself with the distinction between people-pleasing fluff and the kind of architecture that gets inside your head.

The Austrian Cultural Forum, at 11 East 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 319-5300, opens today. "Transforming Modernity," its inaugural season of performances, exhibitions, films, videos and lectures, continues through June. The schedule is available at www.acfny.org.

HEADLINE: This May Be a Bad Year for the Tax Man 

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
IF the government were a business, its management would now be trying to decide whether to issue a revenue warning.
 Tax season is not just a time of misery for those who have to pay. It is also the time when the government learns just how much money it will have available to spend. So far, this year's numbers look bad for the government. 
 Throughout the 1990's, the news was almost always good. Tax receipts as a percentage of the gross domestic product went up, and up, and up, not because of higher tax rates but because a bigger share of national income was going to the well-off, who pay higher marginal tax rates. Many more stock options -- whose profits are taxed at ordinary income tax rates -- were being exercised as the stock market boomed. Capital gains tax payments also soared with the bull market.
That those trends have reversed is no surprise. The question has been the extent to which tax revenue will be affected. Some people, this columnist included, have suspected that the experts who estimate tax revenue grew far too optimistic in recent years and underestimated the likely declines in the post-bubble year of 2001 and later years. One indication that that might be true came from the Investment Company Institute, the trade group for mutual funds. Its preliminary tally shows that mutual funds distributed $23 billion in capital gains to taxable accounts in 2001, down 83 percent from the previous year.
Over all, tax payments will not be down anything like that. But the federal budget deficit for March was significantly higher than expected, because of lower tax collections. And John Youngdahl, a Goldman, Sachs economist, points out that through Wednesday, the Treasury received $33.4 billion this month from individual income- tax payers, off 31 percent from a year ago.
"In the late 1990's, every year tax receipts were sharply higher than expectations," Mr. Youngdahl said. "Now comes the payback, and it could be a rather severe shock to many people."
It must be acknowledged that the current numbers are not conclusive. Most of the money that comes in during April arrives in the final two weeks, for the obvious reason that those who owe money tend to put off mailing their checks until the April 15 deadline. Perhaps more taxpayers delayed filing this year, or perhaps the Internal Revenue Service is not doing as good a job of getting the checks deposited. Maybe there will be a surge in payments in coming days.
But it is also possible that Uncle Sam faces a number of disappointing years for tax receipts. The stock market boom -- particularly the bubble in shares of unprofitable Internet companies that paid no taxes and thus could not use the deductions generated when their executives cashed in stock options -- may have created a tax boom that will never be seen again.
If so, budget deficits will be bigger than anyone expected, and so will government borrowing. The idea of a shortage of Treasury bonds -- only recently a Wall Street worry -- will seem quaint. Congress and the president will face difficult spending decisions.
It would be nice if one result was that the politicians acknowledged that using 10-year budget forecasts in passing tax bills is as ridiculous as Enron's use of its electricity-price forecasts in calculating its profits. Even if the estimates are completely honest, they cannot be made with enough accuracy to be trusted.
As it is, House Republicans -- having made last year's tax cut seem smaller than it was by providing that tax rates would rise in 2011 -- voted yesterday to repeal those increases. Could it be they want to act before this year's tax receipts lead to new deficit forecasts? In any case, it is absurd to set 2011 tax policy in 2002.

HEADLINE: Leading Indicators Edged Higher in March 

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
A crucial gauge of economic activity edged up last month but a more recent measure of new claims for unemployment ticked higher, two reports released yesterday showed, suggesting an economy struggling to recover.
 The Conference Board, a private research group based in New York, reported that its index of leading economic indicators inched up 0.1 percent last month, to 112.3, after holding steady in February. 
Analysts had forecast a 0.3 percent gain. 
 New claims for jobless benefits edged up by a seasonally adjusted 1,000, to 445,000, for the workweek ended April 13, the Labor Department reported.
"The good news is that the economy is firmly in recovery," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com. "The bad news is that it's not quite an expansion yet." 
The leading indicators measures where the overall economy is headed in the next three to six months. It stood at 100 in 1996, its base year. Prior to holding steady in February, the index had risen four consecutive months. In March, 6 of the 10 indicators that make up the leading index increased.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
After a disappointing year, an advertising executive tells his colleagues to mend their ways.

BYLINE:  By STUART ELLIOT 

DATELINE: DANA POINT, Calif. 

 BODY:
A FRANK and provocative call to arms by the chairman of the American Association of Advertising Agencies caused a stir here yesterday at the opening general session of the organization's 2002 Management Conference.
 The conference is being held as Madison Avenue struggles to recover from what O. Burtch Drake, president and chief executive of the association, described in his opening remarks as a "crummy year, a year a lot of us would like to forget." 
 The outpouring of response to the speech by Brendan Ryan, whose term as 2001-02 chairman of the organization ends with the conference, reflects how economic uncertainties are leading the industry to reassess -- or at least consider the possibility of reassessing -- some fundamental practices and values.
"It is a tough time, no question about it," said Mr. Ryan, who is also the chief executive of Foote, Cone & Belding in New York, part of the FCB Group division of the Interpublic Group of Companies. "Candidly, I worry that respect for and in our industry is not very high these days." 
"Clients are respecting what we provide them less and less and are certainly valuing it less and less," he added, referring to the trend toward diminished compensation for services. "And in a recent survey of the general public in Advertising Age, advertising professionals were rated well below lawyers, auto mechanics and, most appallingly, members of Congress. That's not good."
Among what Mr. Ryan gave as "the reasons, not excuses" for attitudes about the industry's heading "the wrong way" were "pressure for short-term earnings, pressure from being part of publicly traded companies" and "the pressure clients are under from Wall Street to deliver instant results."
But the most serious damage is self-inflicted, he added, because "our industry is shifting from friendly competition and mutual respect" to reckless disregard for rivals.
"I'm not saying we stop competing with each other, to get business, keep business, get the best-talented people," Mr. Ryan said.
But "we need to be a bit more careful," he added, in business and personal behavior.
For example, Mr. Ryan said, a reporter recently told him that she had been informed by two leading executives that "Foote, Cone and nine other agencies had been subpoenaed" by the Justice Department in an investigation into the print-ad production industry when in fact no such action had been taken.
"What concerns me is that two presumably senior people in our industry called the press and tried to provoke a story that our industry is corrupt," he added. "That's stupid behavior."
Mr. Ryan also urged agencies to seek to "regain control over the whole new-business process." He particularly cited instances of account reviews in which the participants are willing to sign agreements that "all rights to any ideas, any thinking, any anything become the property of the prospective client" in exchange for a nominal fee for such speculative creative work.
"To me, the ultimate insult is to be given a 'tip' of $5,000 to cover my expenses," Mr. Ryan said, drawing appreciative laughter from the audience of about 300 conference attendees by dismissing that payment with a quick reference to his backside.
"I ask you, does McKinsey do this?" Mr. Ryan asked rhetorically. "Please. Davis & Gilbert? PricewaterhouseCoopers? I don't think so." His references were to two consultants and a prominent law firm.
"I do all that because I need new business, but it's fundamentally flawed," he added. "Maybe if we had people getting together more, we could figure out a better way."
Mr. Ryan's candid criticism was echoed by other speakers in the general session.
"People value you at the value you are seen to put on yourself," said Cindy Gallop, president and chief executive of the New York office of the British agency Bartle Bogle Hegarty, which is 49 percent owned by the Bcom3 Group. 
"Our industry has to do everything we can" to improve, she added, "particularly in this economic climate."
John Farrell, president and chief executive at D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles in New York, a division of Bcom3, said: "This market is more aggressive and more competitive than any market in the world. There's an opportunity for us to make that competition the right kind of competition."
"But it's a challenge," he added, because "the question is, who changes first?"
That question went unanswered for the moment, but the issue is sure to be debated further as the conference continues through tomorrow at the Ritz-Carlton Laguna Niguel here.
As no agency conference would be complete without the presentation of awards, there was some of that yesterday, too, as the association, known as the Four A's, gave out its annual O'Toole Awards for creativity and consistency in work for clients.
For general excellence, the New York office of BBDO Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group, won for agencies with billings above $300 million. Its campaigns were for clients like Cingular Wireless, owned by the BellSouth Corporation and SBC Communications; the FedEx Corporation; PepsiCo; and the Charles Schwab Corporation. As happens in advertising, Schwab dismissed BBDO New York last Friday and shifted its account to another Omnicom agency, GSD&M in Austin, Tex.
Carmichael Lynch in Minneapolis, part of Interpublic, won for general excellence for agencies with billings of $30 million to $300 million. Its campaigns were for clients like the American Advertising Federation, Harley-Davidson and Ikea, owned by Ikea Svenska. Again, as it happens, Ikea recently dismissed Carmichael Lynch.
Gabriel deGrood Bendt in Minneapolis won for general excellence for agencies with billings less than $30 million, for work for clients like the Minnesota Lynx women's professional basketball team.
The O'Toole Award for multicultural advertising went to the Burrell Communications Group in Chicago, 49 percent owned by the Publicis Groupe. Its campaigns were for clients like the McDonald's Corporation; Sears, Roebuck & Company; and Verizon Communications. 
There was no award presented in one category, public service advertising.

HEADLINE: Joblessness in New York City, Still Going Up, Reaches 7.5% 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE EATON

 BODY:
First, the bad economic news: New York City's unemployment rate continued to climb in March to 7.5 percent, the highest level since 1998, the New York State Department of Labor reported yesterday.
 Now, the bad-ish economic news: New York City continued to lose jobs last month, as private sector employment declined by about 2,000 after adjustment for seasonal factors, economists said. Nationally, employment grew in March. 
The good-ish news in New York is that the drop in jobs was far smaller in March than it was in February, when the number of jobs in the city plunged by 14,000 and the unemployment rate reached 7.2 percent, according to the New York City Comptroller's Office.
"It looks like the decline in the City's employment base is subsiding," said Barbara Byrne Denham, chief economist for The New York Stat, an economic newsletter.
As for truly good news, it can be found -- but only outside the city. Long Island and Putnam County have actually been adding jobs in the last 12 months, while the declines in Rockland and Westchester Counties have been almost imperceptible.
Outside of the city, the unemployment rate actually declined last month, to 4.9 percent from 5.1 percent, which is well below the national average of 5.7 percent.
Upstate, New York has suffered job losses in the last year, but more slowly than the national average. Stephen Kagann, chief economist to Gov. George Pataki, said that private sector jobs upstate declined by 0.7 percent in the 12 months ended in March, while nationwide the decline was 1.5 percent. The drop in New York City was 4.2 percent.
Within the city, employment continued to grow in health care, which has been strong throughout the recession, rising by about 6,800, or 2.1 percent, in the last year. Retailing and construction also showed job gains last month, though the growth was anemic for this time of year, said James P. Brown, an analyst at the Labor Department.
Wall Street cut employment again. Over the past 12 months, employment in the securities industry has fallen by almost 17,000, or 9 percent, and a similar percentage at banks.
Business services, which include some economically sensitive businesses like temporary help agencies and advertising, lost about 1,000 jobs in March. But that is a smaller drop than in previous months; over the last year, jobs in that category have fallen by almost 36,000.
"You can't say we've hit bottom yet, but it's always nice to see the declines tapering off," Mr. Brown said.

HEADLINE: Brain Drain In Technology Found Useful For Both Sides 

BYLINE:  By MATT RICHTEL 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, April 18 

 BODY:
Hong Lu, born in Taiwan, raised in Japan, educated at Berkeley and made wealthy in Silicon Valley, founded a company several years ago to sell telecommunications equipment in mainland China. His intention was to take advantage of his multicultural expertise, aim at a growing market and, incidentally, spread the entrepreneurial culture in Asia.
 He did. He gave his employees in China stock options. 
 "At the beginning, people were very suspicious," said Mr. Lu, a co-founder of UTStarcom, a company with its headquarters in Alameda, Calif., and its operations in Beijing. "They said, 'Don't give me paper, give me money.' After we went public, they said, 'Don't give me raises, give me more options.' "
A survey to be published Friday suggests that it is common for immigrants who have become a staple of Silicon Valley's growth to export their experience -- and Northern California's entrepreneurial culture -- back to their homelands.
The survey, paid for by the Public Policy Institute of California, a nonprofit private group that studies issues affecting Californians, and undertaken by a professor at the University of California at Berkeley, found that immigrant entrepreneurs and professionals, in particular from China and India, increasingly are meeting with government officials and consulting with companies in their native countries. The survey found that 18 percent of the immigrants surveyed had invested in their own start-ups or in venture funds in their homelands.
The survey seeks to illuminate the complex labor ties and economic relationship between Silicon Valley and East Asia -- a relationship that has sometimes been criticized as disproportionately benefiting the United States. Some economists, industry analysts and foreign officials have lamented what they call a brain drain from Asian countries -- with computer programmers and experts flocking to Silicon Valley for higher pay and a better standard of living.
The Berkeley researcher who conducted the study, AnnaLee Saxenian, a professor of regional economic development, said the data suggests there is a "brain circulation." 
"Immigrant entrepreneurs are being infected with the Silicon Valley disease," she said, referring to the drive to start ventures. "Then they are exporting it."
The group that Ms. Saxenian focused on in her survey of 2,300 people primarily consisted of Chinese and Indian immigrants who, she said, had extensive experience in Silicon Valley and held higher-education degrees. Ms. Saxenian said that 40 percent of the immigrants surveyed had helped arrange business contacts in their countries, and 30 percent had met with government officials in their homelands.
She found that 76 percent of Indian immigrants and 73 percent of Chinese professionals would consider starting a venture in their countries.
Doug Henton, president of Collaborative Economics, a regional economic strategy group based in Mountain View, Calif., in Silicon Valley, said the survey findings jibed with his observations in recent years. He said one common theme was that Silicon Valley served as the center of research and development and a business incubation center for start-ups, and that entrepreneurs then sought to build manufacturing plants in Asia.
Ms. Saxenian has argued that not just manufacturing is being exported, but also ideas -- specifically a culture of entrepreneurship.
Mr. Lu, of UTStarcom, said the exporting of Silicon Valley culture has been a byproduct of the growth of his company, which has much of its manufacturing, research and development and day-to-day operations in mainland China. For instance, Mr. Lu said that in the mid-1990's, when the company was beginning, he had to educate employees in China about the start-up mentality, notably that it was not just desirable, but possible, to take on huge, often state-owned, competitors.
"Companies like Apple, Palm and other start-ups came from nothing and are competing," Mr. Lu said. His company has tried to disseminate to its employees the culture that drove those companies.

HEADLINE: Plan Approved to Reshape 7 World Trade Block 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
Clearing an obstacle to the rebuilding of 7 World Trade Center and a Consolidated Edison substation in that building, the state's urban development agency approved a plan yesterday to reconfigure the city block that was the site of the building and to restore a segment of Greenwich Street to the downtown street grid.
 The action taken yesterday by the Empire State Development Corporation, the state's urban development agency, uses the state's power of eminent domain to take over a 26-foot-wide strip of Vesey Street, on the south side of the building's site, from the city. 
 The city did not oppose the move, but it is subject to a public hearing and final approval. 
If approved, the state will turn the land over to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which will make it part of the block where a replacement for 7 World Trade Center will be built by Larry A. Silverstein, the developer who holds the lease rights to the site of 7 World Trade Center as well as the larger World Trade Center complex.
The action serves two primary purposes. 
First, it will allow Con Edison to restore the 10 transformer vaults that were in the building, which distributed electricity throughout the downtown area. Those vaults contained nine operating transformers before Sept. 11, nearly two-thirds of all of the transformers operating downtown. 
The transformers will occupy the lower four floors and basement of the new building. Five other transformers supplying downtown Manhattan with electricity operated in a substation near the South Street Seaport, which also had five spare vaults.
Second, the plan establishes a footprint on which a new building could rise, allowing Mr. Silverstein to begin preparations. The new building, as proposed, will be "somewhat taller" than the 47 stories of the previous building, according to state officials, but would have only about 1.7 million square feet of office space, 245,000 square feet less than the former building.
In discussing the proposal yesterday, Empire State Development officials noted that the lease between Mr. Silverstein and the Port Authority calls for the prompt rebuilding of the site in the event of the destruction of the premises.
The replacement building, the base of which will be a parallelogram, will occupy the city block bounded by Barclay Street on the north, Vesey Street on the south, Washington Street on the west and the newly restored Greenwich Street on the east.
Before it collapsed on Sept. 11, the trapezoidal building extended to West Broadway on the east.
Many downtown residents have called for the restoration of the street grid throughout the former World Trade Center site as a way of opening the area to more light and better traffic patterns. But some groups, particularly those representing family members of victims of the attack, have opposed paving portions of the trade center grounds.
Empire State Development officials said that the action yesterday would preserve the possibility of restoring the street grid, in whole or in part, so that such a decision could be made when an agreement about redevelopment was reached.

In Swan Song, Compaq Posts A Small Profit

BYLINE:  By CHRIS GAITHER 

 BODY:
Compaq Computer, the No. 2 maker of personal computers after Dell Computer, posted a slim first-quarter profit yesterday despite a sharp drop in revenue. 
 In what its executives called probably their last earnings call before the closing of their acquisition by Hewlett-Packard, Compaq reported a profit of $44 million, or 3 cents a share, on sales of $7.7 billion. In the period last year, Compaq had sales of $9.2 billion but posted a loss of $131 million, or 8 cents a share, as it restructured to deal with the slowing economy. 
 The earnings release came a day after Hewlett-Packard said that independent inspectors had confirmed a narrow victory in the fight for shareholder approval of the Compaq deal. Excluding $35 million in extraordinary charges related to the merger efforts, Compaq said it earned 4 cents a share, solidly beating analysts' expectations of a penny a share.
Compaq declined to issue a forecast for the coming quarter because it does not expect to be a stand-alone company then.
"Given our expectation that the merger with H.P. will close in the next few weeks, this is likely to be Compaq's last earnings call," said its chief executive, Michael D. Capellas, who will be president of the new Hewlett-Packard. "The next time we talk, we'll be discussing the financial results of the combined company."
The merger still faces significant hurdles, however. Walter B. Hewlett, the dissident director of Hewlett-Packard who led a proxy fight against the $24 billion deal, plans to ask for a partial or complete recount of the tally by IVS Associates of Newark, Del. He has also asked a court in Delaware to throw out some of the votes, contending that Hewlett-Packard won them improperly.
Yet, perhaps preoccupied with other computer makers like Sun Microsystems and Gateway, which also reported earnings yesterday afternoon, Wall Street analysts appeared ready to let Compaq fade quietly into Hewlett-Packard. In the question-and-answer session that followed prepared remarks by Compaq executives, only two analysts, instead of the usual dozens, asked questions. The call ended in 20 minutes, less than one-third the usual time.
In regular trading before the earnings announcement, shares of Compaq rose 14 cents, to $10.82.
Hewlett-Packard wants to merge with Compaq to build strength for a fight with Dell in PC's and low-end servers and with I.B.M. over high-powered computing and consulting services. A report today by the International Data Corporation, a research company in Framingham, Mass., showed that Dell had widened its lead in personal computers.
The industry showed glimmers of the beginning of a gradual recovery. First-quarter PC shipments around the globe declined 2.7 percent, to 31.4 million, over the previous year. In the United States, shipments declined only 0.4 percent. International Data expects the United States to lead a surge in PC sales when the economy recovers, perhaps late this year or in 2003.
"The expectation is, it gets better from here," said Roger Kay, an analyst with the company. "It has been pretty bad."

HEADLINE: Amnesty Accuses Spain of Racism in Its Treatment of Immigrants 

BYLINE:  By EMMA DALY 

DATELINE: MADRID, April 18 

 BODY:
Amnesty International has accused Spain, the steppingstone to Europe for thousands of poor immigrants, of "frequent and widespread" mistreatment of foreigners and ethnic minorities, including torture, and called for the authorities to adopt a plan to combat racism.
 The organization's report, the first on racism in a European country, investigated more than 320 cases of abuse from 1995 to 2002, including deaths and rapes while in custody, beatings and verbal abuse. Amnesty International also expressed concern about the widespread use of racial profiling by the police. 
 "The cases we have documented show a pattern of violation by law enforcement officers of the rights of members of ethnic minorities or persons of non-Spanish origin," writes Gillian Fleming, the author of the report. "Discrimination against these people, tolerated by the authorities, makes them especially vulnerable to torture and ill treatment by state officials."
The economic boom in Spain in the last few years, and its position at a southern frontier of Europe, has spurred an increase in immigration.
The number of foreigners living legally in Spain has risen sharply in 20 years, with an 18 percent increase in 2000 alone, to 1.1 million. The number was about 200,000 in 1981, the report said. Moroccans make up the largest group, followed by Ecuadoreans.
Amnesty International focused on Spain in part because it currently holds the presidency of the European Union. 
It says that racist attacks have increased as the immigrant population has grown, with the recent influx bringing about "a general recognition that racism and xenophobia are at least as serious a problem in Spain as elsewhere in Europe."
In the report, the human rights group detailed the cases of four immigrants who died in police custody, as well as five women who reported being raped or sexually assaulted. 
It also examined the plight of children living without their families or in the street. The report says immigrant children often face abuse, deportation without regard to the law or their family situation, and a lack of protection and legal representation. 
"Physical ill treatment and abuse of authority by police officers," Amnesty International said, was "frequent and widespread," although, for a variety of reasons, "only a small number of ill-treatment cases result in judicial complaints." 
The report says many undocumented immigrants, "living in the hope of receiving work and residence permits, are afraid to lodge complaints with the police or courts." Even when complaints are made, investigations have fallen short of international standards, the reports finds. 
In its discussion of racial profiling, the report cited the case of Rodney Mack, an African-American who is principal trumpet player with the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra, who said he was badly beaten by officers in Barcelona looking for a black car thief.
In Spain, Amnesty International found, officers routinely detain black people and members of other ethnic minorities on suspicion of drug dealing or of not carrying the identity documents that are obligatory in Spain.
The report was rejected by Spanish officials. Ignacio GilLazaro, a congressman from the ruling Popular Party, said, "The police and Civil Guard confront immigration in a deeply humanitarian way."

HEADLINE: Water Rights War Rages on Faltering Rio Grande 

BYLINE:  By JIM YARDLEY 

DATELINE: BOCA CHICA, Tex., April 17 

 BODY:
On a desolate stretch of beach on the border with Mexico, Randy Blankinship steps along what should be the edge of the Rio Grande. Except there is only sand. The river that for thousands of years flowed into the Gulf of Mexico now falls almost a hundred yards short. 
 "That's the mouth of the mighty Rio Grande," said Mr. Blankinship, a state wildlife biologist, with a touch of sarcasm. He knows the joke that the sandbar is the newest international bridge into Mexico. Apparently the Border Patrol is not laughing -- an agent is parked nearby. 
 That the Rio Grande is no longer strong enough to reach the sea is just another example of the crisis that threatens the river and the international region that depends on it. Years of drought have left the area parched. A water war between farmers on both sides of the border has escalated into an international standoff. 
Demand for water is increasing in an area that has historically ranked among the poorest in the nation but is now trying to capitalize on growing trade with Mexico. Population is exploding on both sides of the border as new industries have been established in the past decade.
"For the longest period of time, the Rio Grande Valley has had a water policy in which we hope and pray for a moderate-sized hurricane every 8 to 10 years that would bypass the Valley, land in the watershed and dump in the reservoir," said Judge Gilberto Hinojosa of Cameron County, the highest elected official in the county, which includes Brownsville. "That isn't a water policy."
If water shortages are familiar throughout the nation, the problem here is compounded by the complicated codependence of Mexico and the United States. The primary tributary of the Rio Grande is the Rio Conchos, which flows out of the high desert of Mexico and fills the reservoirs that provide water for American farmers. Under a 1944 treaty, Mexico is supposed to send about 350,000 acre-feet water annually into the Rio Grande, or billions of gallons. The United States, in turn, releases 1.5 million acre-feet of Colorado River water to Mexico. (An acre-foot is about 326,000 gallons.)
But since 1992, Mexico has fallen more than 1.5 million acre-feet of water in arrears, infuriating Rio Grande Valley farmers. Last month, farmers hoped for a breakthrough when President Bush and President Vicente Fox of Mexico met in Monterrey. American farmers, joined by Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, had held a rally to attract attention to their plight. But the summit came and went without even a news release on the issue.
"Getting Mexico to come to the table to meet is almost impossible," said Tudor Uhlhorn, a third-generation farmer with six farms in Cameron County, voicing a frustration held by many American farmers. "They just delay, delay, delay."
On the American side of the river, farmers have just finished spring planting and, in many cases, either have had to reduce the acreage planted or are simply hoping for rain. In one of Mr. Uhlhorn's sorghum fields, he bent over and dug in the dirt until he found a tiny red seed. Usually, he would irrigate this field and the seed would have already grown into a small plant. But with the local reservoirs at about 30 percent of capacity, there is not enough water for him to fully irrigate.
Mr. Uhlhorn's anger and frustration are pointed directly at Mexico's failure to release the water required by treaty. Suspicions are so great on the American side that officials talk of infrared satellite images showing water in Mexican reservoirs. Other officials who have visited Mexico believe the country is simply hoarding water as it develops its own irrigated farmland in the Rio Conchos valley.
"The drought that we're in, that is causing a shortage of water for irrigated farmers, is an act of man, not an act of God," Mr. Uhlhorn said.
One study by a Texas A&M University agricultural economist placed the economic losses in the Rio Grande Valley at nearly $1 billion since 1992, when Mexico first began failing to deliver the allotted water.
But Alberto Szekely, the Mexican government official handling the water issue, said that Mexico was not releasing water because there was none to release.
"The truth of the matter is that our dams are practically empty," Mr. Szekely said. "We have lost 81 percent of our storage capacity."
Mr. Szekely said that the treaty granted leniency during "extraordinary drought," and that the Mexican government was already moving to modernize and improve infrastructure in the Rio Conchos basin to reduce waste. "No water treaty can demand a country to deliver water that doesn't exist," he said.
Mary Kelly, an environmentalist with the Texas Center for Policy Studies, a group heavily involved in state water issues, has angered many American farmers by agreeing that Mexico is not currently able to repay its debt. The biggest reservoir on the Rio Conchos is only 25 percent full, Ms. Kelly said, while another is at 10 percent. 
"There is just no way that they are able to release 1.5 million acre-feet of water," Ms. Kelly said, adding, "The larger issue is that this drought has shown us that we do not have a plan to manage the river in times of drought."
Currently, municipalities in the Rio Grande Valley are not threatened with shortages because their needs are met before those of the farmers. Judge Hinojosa also noted that the area's irrigation system of dirt and concrete canals was wasteful and outdated but that farmers could not afford to update to more modern methods. 
"The problem here is money," he said. "You need to have the federal government and the state government step in."
Here at the beach where the Rio Grande once spilled into the sea, Mr. Blankinship said environmental problems were already emerging. By blocking the river from the sea, the sandbar has choked off the estuary that is the breeding grounds for innumerable species. He said early studies showed that populations of white shrimp and striped mullet have been severely affected.
The reduced water flow has also allowed vegetation like water hyacinth and hydrilla to grow exponentially along the Rio Grande. Usually, the current would flush such vegetation away, but now it is clogging some sections of the river.
"This is a big deal, the loss of an estuary like this," Mr. Blankinship said, pointing to the shallow end of the river. "And it is a bad omen for the future of the Rio Grande to see international water policy result in this."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Are Modestly Lower, Clouded by Earnings Reports

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Stocks moved modestly lower yesterday as Nokia reported a drop in revenue and profit, and investors digested Advanced Micro Devices' weak outlook for the second quarter.
 "The majority of companies are coming out with shaky news," said Al Mirman, market strategist at V Finance in Sarasota, Fla. "One day they say they see signs of a turnaround, then they say, 'We were premature.' The turnaround is not coming as quickly as people thought." 
 The market rebounded from sharper losses at midday when a small plane hit a skyscraper in Milan, Italy, that houses regional government offices. Later reports indicated that the crash was an accident, not a terrorist incident, and that the pilot had sent out a distress call.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 15.50 points, or 0.15 percent, at 10,205.28. The Dow had fallen as much as 163.06 points.
The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 1.60 points, or 0.14 percent, to 1,124.47.
The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 8.24 points, or 0.46 percent, to 1,802.43. 
On the New York Stock Exchange, the number of declining issues barely exceeded those advancing. Volume eased to 1.37 billion shares traded from 1.39 billion on Wednesday.
The lackluster trading reflected some disappointment with first-quarter results, which so far have been mixed. Beyond a handful of very optimistic earnings announcements, the most positive reports have come from companies that surpassed previously reduced expectations and are guardedly optimistic about the future.
A lukewarm economic report failed to cause an upturn. The Conference Board said its index of leading economic indicators, a gauge of the direction of the economy, inched up 0.1 percent last month after holding steady in February.
Among losing stocks yesterday, Nokia, the big Finnish cellphone maker, fell $2.53, or more than 12 percent, to $18.10, after reporting that its first-quarter profit dropped and it reduced its revenue outlook for the rest of the year.
Advanced Micro Devices, the semiconductor maker, recorded a smaller-than-expected loss for the first quarter after the end of trading on Wednesday. Yesterday, though, its shares fell $2.22, or 15 percent, to $12.60. Executives said the computer industry continued to face trying business conditions.
Microsoft eased 26 cents, to $56.37, in regular trading. After the close, the company reported mixed financial results and scaled back its projections for this quarter. Its shares dropped as low as $51.79 after hours, ending at $54.89.
Shares of I.B.M., hard hit last week after earnings fell well short of estimates, gained $4.14 yesterday, closing at $88.95. Sun Microsystems, up in regular trading, fell after hours. It reported a slight quarterly loss.
Investors should not be surprised to see technology and telecommunications stumble, some analysts said, citing inventory gluts.
There were earnings successes, as well. American Express, a Dow component, rose $1.24, to $42.39, after reporting that its profit exceeded projections by 3 cents a share.
McDonald's, also a Dow stock, climbed $1.45, to $28.61, after surpassing earnings expectations by 2 cents a share and saying it would beat Wall Street analysts' forecasts for the full year.
The prices of bonds, a safe-haven investment, rose sharply on news of the Milan plane crash, then fell back.
By late in the day, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was up 7/32 , to a price of 97 16/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.20 percent from 5.23 percent late Wednesday.
The 30-year Treasury bond also rose, gaining 13/32 , to 95 14/32 . Its yield fell to 5.70 percent from 5.73 percent.

HEADLINE: Despite Billions for Discoveries, Pipeline of Drugs Is Far From Full 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW POLLACK 

 BODY:
This should be the golden age for pharmaceutical scientists. The deciphering of the human genome is laying bare the blueprint of human life. Medical research has increased understanding of disease. Robots and computers are turning drug discovery from a mixing of chemicals in a test tube to an industrialized, automated process.
 Yet if industrialization normally means higher speed and lower costs, the pharmaceutical industry has been experiencing the opposite -- a "clear fall in productivity," according to Dr. Frank L. Douglas, the chief scientific officer of Aventis. Instead of narrowing the list of compounds that might be useful in drugs, automation has broadened it -- greatly increasing the number of formulas tested without yet delivering commensurate growth in safe and effective drugs. The industry's output of new drugs has risen only modestly in the last two decades despite a more than sixfold increase, after adjusting for inflation, in research and development spending, to more than $30 billion annually. In the last few years, the output has actually declined. 
 "It makes you wonder: what are they doing?" said John Borzilleri, a health sciences portfolio manager at State Street Research and Management in Boston. "Are they spinning their wheels or is it just a matter of time?" 
The perceived paucity of new drugs in company pipelines has become a preoccupation of the industry and of Wall Street. Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck and other drug makers have said earnings will be lower than expected this year, in part because there are not enough new products to offset declining sales of old ones that lose patent protection and face competition from generic versions.
The industry mantra is now "it's the pipeline, stupid," said Dr. Steven M. Paul, group vice president for discovery research at Eli Lilly in Indianapolis. But no one has yet found a reliable way to fill the pipeline.
With drugs not coming fast enough to sustain the double-digit growth in earnings and revenue that Wall Street has come to expect, more companies might merge, to bolster earnings through reduced costs, analysts say. Companies are also trying to increase revenue from the drugs they do have by raising prices, advertising heavily to consumers and scrambling to extend their patents, actions that have embroiled the companies in controversy.
Over the last 25 years, a parade of technologies has promised to transform drug development: genetic engineering, rational drug design, combinatorial chemistry, improved screening -- and now, genomics.
Yet the time spent to develop a drug, not counting the months consumed by government review, has lengthened to more than 11 years from about 9 years in the 1980's, according to the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development, and the cost has more than doubled, after adjusting for inflation, to $800 million. Critics, who note that the Tufts Center gets money from drug companies, say those figures are inflated to justify high drug costs.
Still, the industry's failure rate, a big part of its costs, has not declined. Only one in about 5,000 early drug candidates and only one in five drugs that enter clinical trials ever make it to market, experts say. The remainder drop out because they do not work or are toxic.
"The odds are just dreadful, and they seem to be getting worse," Julie A. Olson, a vice president for licensing at Pfizer, told a recent biotechnology conference.
Some executives say that given the long development period, genomics and some other technologies are too new to have made a difference. Recent increases in research spending should lead to more drugs 10 years from now, they say.
"We're beginning to tackle all sorts of diseases we couldn't before," said Dr. Goran Ando, head of research and development at Pharmacia in Peapack, N.J.. But, he added, "it won't happen overnight."
To be sure, looking at just the number of drugs getting to market can be misleading because the companies are producing better-selling drugs. C. Anthony Butler, an analyst at Lehman Brothers, said the industry's pipeline in 1995 contained 450 drugs, of which he projected that only 15 would have peak annual sales exceeding $800 million. In 2001, he said, the pipeline had about the same number of drugs but 92 of them were potential $800 million products.
Maintaining that pace, however, will not be easy. "In some ways the easy drugs have been done," said Dr. Robert H. Rubin, a professor of health sciences and technology and of medicine at Harvard.
Drug development is a cumbersome process. Companies usually start by identifying a target, often a protein in the body that is thought to play a role in some disease. Then they try to either design or find a compound that can attach itself to the target protein, thereby changing the course of the disease. They must make sure the compound is otherwise suitable -- that it can be made into a pill, for example. It is then tested in animals for toxicity. Only then can it be tested on humans.
Technology has helped with the early part of the process, the discovery of compounds, but not as much with the costliest and most time-consuming portion of drug development -- clinical trials. Scientists still cannot tell whether a drug will work or be toxic until they test it. "The slowest parts of drug discovery and development are pretty much the same," said Peter S. Kim, the executive vice president for research and development at Merck.
But even in the early part of drug development there has been disappointment. In the 1990's, a new technology called combinatorial chemistry allowed companies to create hundreds of thousands of compounds by mixing chemical building blocks in different combinations. Drug makers then developed robots to screen this wealth of compounds.
But many of the compounds created this way lacked characteristics that would make them suitable for use as drugs.
Still, there has been progress. Bristol-Myers, for example, increased the number of compounds coming out of its early discovery stage to 14 a year late in the 1990's from 6 a year early in the decade after spending $50 million to install an advanced "screen machine."
The newest technology, genomics, could increase the number of targets in much the way combinatorial chemistry increased the number of chemicals. Until now, virtually all drugs have been directed at an estimated 500 proteins in the body. But by sifting through the human genome, companies are finding thousands of genes that produce previously unknown proteins that might be involved in the disease.
In the long run, that is expected to open vast horizons, and perhaps even let companies reduce failure rates in animal testing and in clinical trials by enabling them to predict toxicity and effectiveness by studying how a drug affects genes. But in the short run, it has left the industry inundated with targets and data that may increase the failure rate by leading companies to start trials before they fully understand what the new data are telling them.
As Jerry Karabelas, a former head of pharmaceuticals at Novartis, once put it: "Data, data everywhere, and not a drug, I think."
To bolster their output in the meantime, big drug companies are turning to biotechnology companies for products and technology, typically spending about 30 percent of their research budgets on outside collaborations. There can be fierce bidding and rising prices for drugs that are close to reaching market, raising the risks for drug companies. Last fall, Bristol-Myers agreed to pay $2 billion to ImClone Systems for an ownership stake and the rights to market a cancer drug. But approval of the drug has since been delayed.
By contrast, some analysts and executives say, the drug companies are becoming more cautious about paying for basic technology because they are disappointed that what they have acquired so far has not led to more drugs.
Some analysts say the drug industry is undergoing a transition similar to the computer industry's move from vertical integration, exemplified by I.B.M., to a horizontal structure -- with Intel making chips, Microsoft making software and others specializing in manufacturing or sales. Drug companies, these analysts say, will increasingly become the marketers and coordinators of work done by others.
"We think the old model of having everything under your own roof, a completely integrated monolithic organization, is not feasible," said Pradip K. Banerjee, a partner at Accenture, the consulting company.
Because biotechnology companies are smaller and more focused, they can often move faster than the big drug companies. Vertex Pharmaceuticals, based in Cambridge, Mass., said it spent about $50 million on each of seven drugs to get them into the second phase of clinical trials, a fraction of the usual costs. Joshua S. Boger, the chief executive of Vertex, said his biotechnology company was organized from scratch to take advantage of new technologies. If new technology is just put into the existing process, "you're just going to move the bottleneck to another place," he said.
But as biotechnology companies have moved from making well-known compounds like insulin to more complex challenges, many of them are experiencing failures in clinical trials or at the Food and Drug Administration. Amgen, the largest biotechology company, went 10 years without a new drug until last year. It is now growing by using the tactics of bigger drug companies -- introducing improved versions of its drugs and buying another company, in its case Immunex.
In any case, executives say they had little choice but to try new technology. "Had we not had these technologies," said Dr. Douglas of Aventis, "I think the situation would have been much worse."

HEADLINE: SCANDALS IN THE CHURCH: THE SEXUALITY ISSUE; 
Homosexuality in Priesthood Is Under Increasing Scrutiny

BYLINE:  By LAURIE GOODSTEIN 

 BODY:
With the Roman Catholic Church weathering one case after another of priests who sexually abused boys, the Catholic faithful are asking whether there is a closeted culture of homosexuality in the priesthood, and if so whether it is connected to the sexual abuse problem. 
 The Vatican itself will discuss the issue when American cardinals meet with Pope John Paul II next week in Rome for a hastily arranged session on the American abuse scandal. 
 It is a sea change for Catholics, especially conservatives, who only eight years ago protested against "Priest," a film about a struggling gay priest, because they considered the entire topic anti-Catholic.
Now, Catholic publications from the liberal Jesuit magazine America to official diocesan newspapers are calling for an examination of homosexuality in the priesthood. 
"The overwhelming majority of the sexual abuse cases involve adult men having sex with teenage boys and young men, and by ordinary English usage we call that a homosexual relationship," said the Rev. Richard John Neuhaus, editor of First Things, a conservative journal. "So there's no blinking regarding that fact." 
No reliable statistics exist about either the extent of the abuse or broader questions about the sexuality of the clergy. A church built on a theoretically chaste priesthood has had little interest in commissioning or even permitting such studies. Eugene Kennedy, an emeritus professor of psychology at Loyola University of America, said that in the last 15 years American bishops had asked him more than once to conduct a study of priests' sexuality, but that other bishops had quashed the idea.
Concerning sexual abuse, the church has not kept comprehensive records on how many priests have been accused or found guilty, though the recent scrutiny has prompted some dioceses to review 50 years of personnel records and compile lists of problem priests. The Philadelphia Diocese, for example, reported 35.
Still, the only nationwide effort at record-keeping has been done by victims' lawyers like Sylvia Demarest in Dallas and Jeffrey Anderson in St. Paul, who claim to have assembled lists of more than 1,000 priests accused of abuse in the United States. It is unknown how many of these accusations involve men who are no longer in the priesthood, were wrongly accused, or whose cases date back four or more decades. There are currently 46,075 priests in the United States. 
Scientists who have studied sexual offenders warn that the scandal in the church has caused two distinct issues -- homosexuality and child abuse -- to become erroneously and recklessly intertwined. They note that homosexuals are no more likely than heterosexuals to be pedophiles. 
Experts also say that few of the abusive priests can be considered genuine pedophiles because many of their victims were not children, but teenagers. A person attracted exclusively to adolescents is an ephebophile, but researchers disagree whether the abuse has been caused by priests actually suffering from ephebophilia, or by those who have preyed on teenagers simply because they are accessible. 
The assumption that homosexuality has anything to do with this crisis has arisen largely because a disproportionate number of those abused were male. 
Dr. Fred S. Berlin, associate professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University, said, "Some of this has been about homosexual men giving in to temptation with adolescent males. At the same time, we should make it clear that homosexuals are no more risk to children than heterosexuals. In terms of the bigger picture, there are every bit as many heterosexual men giving into sexual temptation with female adolescents."
Some experts suggest that the entire picture might be different if accurate information were available about the priests' victims. Dr. William Stayton, a psychologist who worked on a surgeon general report on sex education that was released last year, said he suspected many adolescent girls and women had also been abused by priests.
"We're just beginning now to get women who are coming forward," Dr. Stayton, a professor at Widener University's Center for Education in Philadelphia, said. "My guess is that if the number of women who were abused came out, it would be even more than the males."
In the absence of facts are theories colored by ideologies. The surprising revelation is that all interested parties -- liberals and conservatives, pro-gay and antigay -- seem to agree that discussions about the sexual abuse crisis also need to address clergy homosexuality. Where the camps diverge entirely is in explaining just how the two are linked. 
Liberals, and many experts who have treated sexually abusive priests, say the cause of the crisis is the church's lack of candor about sexuality and the strictures of priestly celibacy. The problem arises, they say, when sexually stunted and inexperienced young men are recruited into an institution in which sex is taboo, incubated in the all-male hothouse called a seminary, and then are deposited into a lonely occupation where a good part of their human contact is with young boys.
"So many of the priests are psychosexually immature, it makes them more vulnerable to taking advantage of, or falling in love with, if you will, age-inappropriate people," said A. W. Richard Sipe, a psychotherapist and former Benedictine monk who has written several books about priests and sexuality.
Conservatives like Father Neuhaus link the abuse problem to American libertinism and a lack of faithfulness to celibacy in the American church. They argue that after the liberalizing effects of Vatican II and the gay rights movement, bishops and religious orders ordained too many gay men, and looked the other way when those priests broke their celibacy vows, either with one another or with youths.
They point to the case of Rev. Paul Shanley, a molester whose superiors in Boston failed to discipline him even after he gave a speech sanctioning sex between men and boys.
"We are now bearing the consequences of the collapse of discipline," Father Neuhaus said.
There was already a debate about homosexuality inside church circles. Now the sexual abuse scandal, and the Vatican's response to it, has intensified the conflict. The papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls, when asked about the abuse crisis in an interview last month, immediately focused on homosexuality. "People with these inclinations just cannot be ordained," he said.
Vatican observers say that the scandal has prompted the Congregation for Catholic Education, a Vatican office, to reconsider whether new norms for psychological screening of seminary candidates should bar candidates who have a homosexual orientation.
Among gay priests, panic is growing that they will be made the scandal's scapegoats. 
"A lot of people are worried now that there's going to be a witch hunt against gay seminarians and gay priests," said one New York priest. "Priests are afraid that anybody with a homosexual inclination is going to have to repress that even more."
Estimates of how many seminarians are gay range from the 30 percent by Mr. Sipe to the more than 50 percent cited by the Rev. Donald Cozzens, a former seminary rector and author of "The Changing Face of the Priesthood." Father Cozzens said in an interview that his estimate was based on anecdotes and impressions, not a study. 
All sides agree that the priesthood attracts a disproportionate percentage of gay men. They also agree that religious orders, like the Franciscans and Jesuits, have attracted more gay men than the diocesan priesthood. Some orders have had openly gay caucuses. 
Mark D. Jordan, a religion professor at Emory University who wrote "The Silence of Sodom: Homosexuality in Modern Catholicism," said, "An all-male celibate priesthood is an attractive choice for men who don't want to get married, don't want to participate in the worldly economy of families and lineage, who want to be with other men, and want to be within a system that will either help them not act on their desires or else cover up when they do act on their desires." 
Some gay men discover their sexual orientation while in seminary or as priests, and leave because they do not want to live closeted lives.
Tom Caldarola, a psychotherapist in San Francisco, is a former Jesuit priest. "Part of my struggle all the way through was with this issue -- how to stay true to my vows," he said. "I was 17 when I entered, I had never had sex, and as time went on I began to form questions and would go in and out in getting very close to people and having to deal with it as if it was a sinful thing. And there was no way to talk about it."
A study of Catholic priests' attitudes released last month by Dean R. Hoge and Jacqueline E. Wenger of the Catholic University of America asked: "If celibacy for priests became optional, do you think you would ever get married?" Only 12 percent said yes, 12 percent were uncertain, and 76 percent said no. 
Catholic teaching says that though some people are inherently homosexual, homosexual sex is a sin. The church's catechism says that "homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered," because gay sex cannot lead to reproduction.
The catechism urges tolerance toward homosexuals because they "do not choose their homosexual condition; for most of them it is a trial." All homosexuals, it says, are "called to chastity." 
Experts say noncelibate gay priests are far more likely to be sexually active with adults than with minors. Two gay priests interviewed for this article said they were involved in long-term relationships with adult men and knew others who looked for casual sex with adults.
Mr. Jordan said that there were a "very large number of Catholic laymen who have priest lovers or priest boyfriends who are as committed as anyone to maintaining the secret. The priests would never greet them in public or acknowledge them." 
Mr. Sipe said he had tried to research how many gay and straight priests violated their vows. "I found in my studies that homosexually oriented men are every bit observant of their celibacy as heterosexual men," he said.
Yet some straight priests complain of a double standard that is more permissive of homosexual than heterosexual affairs. Gay priests and former priests said it was much easier for a gay priest than a straight priest to maintain a romantic relationship because a close alliance with a woman automatically raised suspicions. 
In other countries, they said, a priest with a mistress -- or a wife -- is commonplace. "Down in Latin America there's a double standard," one gay priest said. "So many priests have their wife and family, a solid family relationship, and the bishops know this. On the outside, their children will say, 'that's my uncle,' just to keep up the pretense, but everybody knows the situation. But a homosexual priest would not have his partner living with him in the rectory."
Ultimately, many Catholics say, the idea that the church will purge itself of gay priests is unlikely. There are too many homosexuals in the hierarchy, too many gifted gay men serving in a church that is starved for priests. Even a conservative like Father Neuhaus said he was not in favor of banning gay men from the priesthood. 
"I think we would probably discover we would be retroactively excluding a good many canonized saints over 2,000 years," he said.

As Other Pony Cars Eat Dust, the Mustang Roars On

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

 BODY:
FOR Brad Barnett, it all goes back to his childhood. "When I was 3 years old, my dad bought a light blue 1973 Mustang coupe from my mother's sister," Mr. Barnett recalled recently. "I told him I wanted the car to be mine and he promised it to me that day."
 Today, Mr. Barnett, now 23 and a manager at a technology company in Birmingham, Ala., runs two Web sites for devotees of the Ford Mustang, the larger of which (bradbarnett.net/mustangs) averages about 80,000 hits a month. He is also a member of the Magic City Mustangs, a Birmingham club where guys talk Stangs and sports and swap parts. 
 "We're not trying to save the world," Mr. Barnett said. "It's just guys who like Mustangs, talking Mustangs." 
Today, though, the pony cars Mr. Barnett and his fellow auto enthusiasts covet are a dying breed. The latest casualty came when General Motors said that this would be the last year for its Camaro and Firebird models, because of flagging sales.
Pony cars, named for the original Mustang of 1964, are small, sporty cars that could, in theory, carry four people. They looked athletic, but many came with economical six-cylinder or small V-8 engines that weren't very fast.
Some pony cars also qualified as muscle cars, with huge, powerful V-8's and fat tires that burned rubber when the driver jammed the gas pedal.
Back in the 1960's and 70's, the muscle car defined masculine bravado on the road the way electrified Stratocasters did on the radio. Burt Reynolds immortalized the Firebird Trans Am in "Smokey and the Bandit." The Duke boys ruled Hazzard County from a Dodge Charger nicknamed General Lee.
There were others, too, now long gone: the Plymouth Road Runner, the Chevelle SS, the Olds 4-4-2.
Now the Mustang stands practically alone. In recognition of its staying power, in 2004, the Ford Motor Company will move production of the car from the aging assembly plant in Dearborn, Mich., to a newer facility.
J Mays, Ford's chief designer, is planning a retro look for the car by mid-decade, so that its body more resembles the sinuous brute Steve McQueen drove in "Bullitt."
This has worked before for Mr. Mays, Detroit's king of retro. He revived the Ford Thunderbird, which had evolved from a noble creature to a profoundly ugly duckling, by giving it a stylish makeover. He did the same when he worked on the Volkswagen Beetle.
Mustang owners, though, are famously fanatical, and keeping them happy is crucial to keeping Mustang alive.
"They know every nut and bolt and every serial number," said Mr. Mays, adding that Ford consulted fan clubs to make sure it was not pushing designs beyond their comfort zone. "They want you to act as a curator, not as a designer."
There are 430 Mustang fan clubs with more than 70,000 members around the world.
There are specialty magazines like Muscle Mustangs & Fast Fords, a thick Primedia publication mostly comprising ads for custom parts like spherical bushings and replacement microchips that can rev up a car's performance beyond its factory specifications and even violate the warranty. (The April issue's cover features a bikini-clad brunette, perched on a hood of a yellow Mustang, flashing a come-hither smile.)
As Mr. Barnett's experience shows, not all Mustang buyers are 50-something guys in a midlife crisis. The average buyer is 39, and 38 percent of them are women.
Mr. Barnett said his love of the car was rekindled after seeing the 2000 movie, "Gone in 60 Seconds," in which a thief played by Nicholas Cage pined for an expensive version of the Mustang known as the Shelby.
"That brought back the Mustang fever," Mr. Barnett said.
After graduating from the University of Alabama in December, he said, "I decided I needed a car, a Mustang GT convertible. True blue."
One of his Web sites, which he started last year, is a collection of pictures of his own cars and others. The other site (MagicCityMustangs.com) is a home page for the Magic City Mustangs.
He also surfs more sophisticated sites, like StangNet.com, which is run by an Alabama e-commerce company and has more than half a million message board postings. Many are written in a jargon incomprehensible to those who just know where the oil goes.
"I have a 69 block 351W w/edelbrock performer r.p.m. intake," one drag racer said in a posting on the site. "I need a distributor that will work with the msd 6AL ignition I have." Huh?
Part of the appeal of the car, Mr. Barnett said, is that Mustangs can be customized so that hardly any two are alike. He has outfitted his own with special turn signals and a shifter that cuts down the time it takes to change gears. His custom lighter says "EJECT." ("I'm a James Bond fan," he said.)
"You buy a Mustang, you buy a car, a hobby, membership in a club," he said. "It is like a fraternity. If I wanted transportation, I would have bought a Civic."
Muscle cars were originally aimed at young men like Mr. Barnett, who were looking for cheap horsepower.
The Mustang and the Pontiac G.T.O., both souped up models built on the foundation of boring family cars, got the craze started in the mid-1960's. 
But by the late 1980's, G.T.O. was long gone and an aging design had taken its toll on Mustang, to the point that Ford executives considered putting it out of its misery.
The company assigned engineers to see if the car could be salvaged. John Coletti, a Mustang enthusiast who is now chief engineer of Ford's special vehicles team, led the effort. He took his charge quite seriously.
"When you're given this kind of American treasure," he said, "you don't dare want to screw that thing up." 
He and eight other engineers set up shop in an abandoned department store. They brought back some of the original Mustang's styling, such as the image of the horse on the grill.
"That seems a small thing to a lot of people, but to the enthusiasts, it was a monster," he said.
Still, it is not easy to survive in an era when most young guys seem to prefer S.U.V.'s and pickups, or, in some cases, hot-rod versions of Honda Civics. (American muscle cars were largely absent in a recent movie about street racing, "The Fast and the Furious.")
Even the passing of the Camaro, the Mustang's nemesis, is bittersweet. If the Mustang is the New York Yankees of muscle cars, then diehards feel that in the Camaro they have lost the Boston Red Sox.
"It's terrible all the way around," Mr. Coletti said of General Motor's decision. "It's like they've created a huge, gaping hole."
General Motor does plan to revive the Pontiac G.T.O. by next year, though the car will be built in Australia with a price beginning at least at $30,000, making it a bit rich to be a true muscle car.
The Mustang starts at just under $18,000, though the name encompasses several versions of varying horsepower.
This year, sales are down 20 percent, through March. But Mustang has largely been revived. Ford sold 169,000 Mustangs last year, more than double its sales a decade earlier.
On a recent visit to the Mustang plant in Dearborn, Michael Joseph, who handles internal communications at the facility, said there were 4,000 workers when he started as a line worker nearly three decades ago. "Now we have 1,800 people," he said. "But the market has changed."
He added that his son wanted, but would not get, a Ford Expedition. As a teenager, Mr. Joseph, 48, saved up to buy a Camaro and dreamed of driving to Hollywood.
"I thought I was hot stuff, too," he said, watching workers inspecting a banana yellow Mustang as it rolled slowly down the line.
Nowadays, Mr. Joseph drives a Taurus.
"I'm a family man," he said. "I've got a son in college. Soon as he gets done, watch out baby."

SAFETY RECORD
Suit Over Fuel Tanks Raises Concerns
THOUGH the Mustang has its undeniably devoted fans, a recent lawsuit has raised some questions about the car's safety record.
Earlier this year, an Atlanta lawyer who deposed more than a dozen Ford officials in the course of an 18-month lawsuit made public documents suggesting that the Mustang's fuel tank failed some of Ford's own tests while it was being redesigned in the early 1990's and may have been unusually susceptible to fires.
The lawyer, Joseph A. Fried, was representing the family of a woman who died of burns suffered in a collision involving her 1996 Mustang convertible. Ford settled that lawsuit in January.
The Mustang is one of the last car models to have its fuel tank near the rear bumper. Twelve lawsuits involving Mustang fires have been settled since 1995.
Ford officials strongly deny any safety problem. The car that was produced passed Ford's comprehensive tests as well as government safety tests, they say.
In an interview earlier this year, a Ford spokeswoman, Sara Tatchio, said, "The Mustang has always exceeded all government regulations." She added, "We believe it is an extremely safe vehicle."
According to statistics from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 6 percent of recent Ford Mustangs involved in rear-impact fatal crashes also had fires. For Chevrolet Camaros and Pontiac Firebirds, that number is 5 percent. The difference in the figures for the two groups was about seven-tenths of a percentage point, and the government said the difference was not statistically significant. Danny Hakim

Hints of Woe As Microsoft Posts Gains

BYLINE:  By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, April 18 

 BODY:
Microsoft, the world's largest software publisher, delivered what it said were strong PC software results today combined with weaker corporate sales for its third fiscal quarter in 2002, suggesting that the company is being held back by the stagnant economy.
 Microsoft also scaled back its projections for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2002 and for its 2003 fiscal year. The pessimistic guidance indicated that like the world's largest computer maker, I.B.M., which reported disappointing first-quarter results on Wednesday, Microsoft is having trouble escaping a dismal corporate business environment. 
 Even in sales of its new Windows XP operating system, where the company said it had displayed unusual strength, several analysts suggested that the improvements might be credited in part to changes in accounting practices that altered the point at which the company recognizes revenue. 
Sales of Microsoft's operating systems to computer makers were up 15 percent from a year ago, said Sanjiv G. Hingorani, a financial analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, adding, "PC shipments weren't up that much, I can assure you."
Microsoft's chief financial officer, John G. Connors, disputed the criticism, saying that accounting changes were not reflected in the Windows XP sales numbers in the third quarter. The company said the shift to XP was remarkable within the personal computer industry: during the quarter, Windows XP shipped on almost 60 percent of all PC's, representing the fastest growth rate of any of Microsoft's operating systems to date.
Microsoft also indicated in several ways during the day that sales of its much-promoted Xbox game machine had been more disappointing than previously known. This morning, before its earnings report was released, the company announced that it was significantly cutting the price of the Xbox player in Europe and Australia, where the product has not been doing well.
In the company's conference call with analysts this afternoon, Mr. Connors said Microsoft was scaling back its projection of Xbox sales this year to 3.5 millin to 4 million units, from 4.5 million to 6 million units. The company said it was also particularly disappointed with the sales of Xbox in Japan, but insisted that it would take a long-term orientation to that market.
Microsoft, which is based in Redmond, Wash., said its revenue reached $7.25 billion for its third quarter ended March 31, up 13 percent from $6.4 billion for the quarter last year. Net income for the quarter was $2.74 billion, or 49 cents a share, a total that included an $847 million after-tax gain on the sale of its Expedia travel Web site and an $806 million after-tax charge related to "investment impairments."
The per-share figure fell short of analysts' forecasts of 51 cents as reported by Thomson Financial/First Call. But the company attributed the shortfall to lower-than-expected gains from the sale of its Expedia business and larger-than-expected costs associated with its investment in AT&T's broadband cable business. Microsoft said it had taken a charge of $1.2 billion for the quarter related to the AT&T investment and a total of $3 billion in charges for the year to date.
In terms of operating income, the company said it had actually had an excellent quarter, outperforming its guidance by 6 cents a share.
"The PC market was a little better than we expected," Mr. Connors said, noting that that improvement was offset by softness in corporate information technology spending.
Microsoft shares dropped as low as $51.79 in after-hours trading. Earlier, before the release of the earnings report, they fell 26 cents, to $56.37, in regular trading. The stock has declined 15 percent in the last year. But analysts said that PC software sales, which continue to be the heart of Microsoft's business, remained strong.
"From operations, they beat the Street number nicely," said Richard G. Sherlund, an analyst at Goldman Sachs.
Much of the company's efforts in its conference call this afternoon were focused on convincing analysts that good news would await a return of corporate profits and counseling them to prepare for lower profits in 2003, when the company plans to make "big bets" in new businesses.
"Definitely in the verbiage they've been citing the corporate spending environment as being very muted," said Chris Shilakes, a Merrill Lynch analyst.
The best hope for a strong Microsoft recovery would be a resurgence of the PC marketplace, which has contracted in each of the last four quarters around the world. Mr. Connors said he thought growth in the PC market could reach the "low single digits" next year.
Microsoft executives also stressed that the revenue numbers were more difficult to gauge because corporate customers were increasingly shifting from buying to licensing software. In that case revenue is recognized on a deferred basis.
Some analysts continue to say that the company's sales of software for businesses' information technology operations remain weak.
"Their enterprise software sales were down sequentially from last quarter," said David Readerman, a partner at Thomas Weisel Partners. "You square that with Intel talking about the strength on their server side, and it's obvious the heart of Microsoft's I.T. business is weak."

EBay's Rapid Growth Beats Expectations

BYLINE:  By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
EBay, the big Internet bazaar, reported today that its rapid and profitable growth continued in the first quarter, barely slowed by the drag that has hampered many other Internet companies.
 EBay earned $47.6 million in the quarter, up 125 percent from a year ago. The company posted revenue of $245 million, up 59 percent. Both measures were slightly ahead of analysts' expectations. 
 EBay said it had better-than-expected sales of merchandise in the United States and in Europe, especially Britain. Domestic growth, in particular, is being driven by increasing sales of practical goods like computers, electronics and books. Each of these areas now represents more sales volume than the Beanie Babies and other collectible items that were eBay's early claims to fame.
Moreover, a price increase helped increase eBay's auction-related fee income to 6.8 percent of the auction sales price from 6.5 percent a year ago.
This is not to say that eBay was unscathed by the turmoil in the Internet economy. Revenue from advertising on its site was $19 million in the quarter. That represents only 8 percent of its total revenue, down from 13 percent a year earlier. The company blamed the tough market faced by AOL Time Warner, which sells advertising on behalf of eBay. Similarly, the commissions paid to eBay by other companies that offer services like escrow or photographs to its sellers also fell short of expectations.
"Obviously I'm disappointed in the shortfall in advertising and services," said Mark Rowen, an analyst with Prudential Securities, who said that eBay's stock would be under pressure today as a result. Still, he said these issues were relatively small.
"The transaction side of their business, which is their core, is doing extremely well," he said. EBay's shares fell $1.90, to $51.14, in after-hours trading.
Another lagging area was eBay's Billpoint system, which allows people who win auctions to pay sellers by credit card. As a result of aggressive promotion, Billpoint is now accepted by sellers in 27 percent of its auctions. But rival PayPal is accepted in 70 percent of auctions in the United States. 
EBay's chief financial officer, Rajiv Dutta, declined to talk about reports earlier this week that the company had been in talks to acquire PayPal. But he said eBay was pleased with the progress of Billpoint.
Despite these problems, eBay said it now expected to post revenue of $1.1 billion for the full year, at the high end of its earlier forecast. And it expects pro forma earnings per share of 73 cents to 75 cents, up 3 to 4 cents from its previous guidance.
In addition to its results presented according to generally accepted accounting principles, eBay also released a pro forma version of its income statement that stripped away charges related to acquisitions and stock options.
Internet companies, and others, have frequently used such nonstandard pro forma presentations, but this practice has come under increasing criticism by the Securities and Exchange Commission. In its financial report last week, Yahoo stopped releasing pro forma earnings.
Mr. Dutta said that eBay would eventually drop the pro forma disclosure, but it could not do that now because analysts had become accustomed to estimating company results using the pro forma method. He said that in eBay's case the difference had become modest.
For the first quarter, eBay earned 17 cents a share based on generally accepted accounting and 18 cents a share using the pro forma method. Analysts had expected 16 cents.

McDONALD'S PROFIT FALLS FOR 6TH CONSECUTIVE QUARTER

BYLINE:  AP 

 BODY:
 The McDonald's Corporation reported lower earnings for a sixth consecutive quarter yesterday, a 33 percent decline reflecting the sluggish global economy and a mad cow scare that has hurt sales in Japan. Net earnings were $253.1 million, or 20 cents a share, down from $378.3 million, or 29 cents a share, a year earlier. 
Excluding certain charges, earnings were 31 cents a share, 2 cents better than Wall Street analysts had expected. Sales rose 2 percent, to $3.6 billion from $3.51 billion. Systemwide sales, which include company-operated and franchised stores, increased 1 percent, to $9.7 billion from $9.65 billion. Sales at restaurants in the United States rose 2 percent, helped by the addition of 337 restaurants. Shares of McDonald's rose $1.46, or 5.4 percent, to $28.62.

HEADLINE: House Passes Bill to Make Bush's Tax Cut Permanent 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 18 

 BODY:
The House voted today to make permanent the 10-year tax cut signed into law last year by President Bush, giving Republicans a symbolic election year victory in the face of criticism from Democrats that the move was fiscally reckless.
 The vote was 229 to 198. Nine Democrats voted for the bill, which is unlikely go anywhere in the Senate. One Republican, Representative Constance A. Morella of Maryland, who faces a tough re-election fight in a newly drawn Democratic-leaning district, opposed it. 
 The measure was intended to address a procedural stipulation that required last year's tax cut to expire at the end of 2010, meaning that in 2011 tax rates would revert to their levels at the start of last year. Last year's legislation, the centerpiece of Mr. Bush's domestic agenda, gradually cut personal income tax rates, raised the child credit and phased out the federal tax on large estates.
Republicans said that extending the tax cut was affordable and a matter of common sense. Democrats said it would compound the mistake Congress made in passing the biggest tax cut in 20 years in the belief that the government would reap a huge budget surplus over the subsequent decade. In fact, much of the surplus that remained after the tax cut disappeared when the economy faltered and government spending increased after the Sept. 11 attacks.
The cuts passed last year reduced taxes by $1.35 trillion over 10 years, with the scale of the cuts growing substantially in the last few years. Making the legislation permanent would reduce federal revenues by $125.3 billion in 2011, $229.3 billion in 2012 and hundreds of billions of dollars a year after that. 
The projected $229.3 billion tab in 2012 is about $179 billion in today's dollars, according to the Democratic staff of the House Ways and Means Committee. That is roughly equivalent to total federal spending this year on education, employment, social services, space and science, the environment, community development and agriculture.
The Senate majority leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, said this week that he would never bring the measure to the floor, meaning that today's action in the House is far more likely to provide material for campaign commercials in the fall than to become law.
In an often bitter debate on the House floor, both parties laid out arguments that they are sure to carry into the Congressional elections. Republicans said that failure to extend the tax cut would be the equivalent of a huge tax increase, albeit one that would not take effect until 2011. 
"If we do nothing," said Representative Kenny Hulshof, Republican of Missouri, taxpayers would "see the largest tax increase our nation has ever forced upon them."
Democrats sought to tie the vote to what they view as their most potent electoral issue, the future of Social Security. They said that allocating hundreds of billions of dollars a year to the tax cut in perpetuity would endanger the government's ability to pay Social Security benefits when the vast boomer generation retires.
"The issue is what's going to happen on Social Security," said Representative Richard A. Gephardt, Democrat of Missouri, the minority leader. "Mark my words, it's going to be an issue in the election."
The partisan impasse about extending the tax cut is just one element in a broader political battle concerning the budget this year. 
Democrats noted throughout the debate that Mr. Bush has had to ask Congress to raise the limit on government borrowing to reflect the abrupt turnaround in the nation's fiscal condition. Democrats said the need to raise the debt ceiling -- and the reluctance of many Republicans to vote to do so in an election year -- shows that the government cannot afford a longer-term tax cut.
The closely divided Senate now appears unlikely to be able to pass a budget resolution this year, leaving Congress without a blueprint for the annual spending bills that the appropriations committees will take up in coming weeks.
Mr. Bush is pressing Congress to approve his military spending requests quickly and then turn to other spending bills. But Democrats seem unlikely to comply with that request and plan to fight for their spending priorities, especially in education, health care and the environment.
Though Mr. Daschle seems to have the votes to make good on his vow not to make the tax cut permanent, blocking the extension in the Senate could create considerable political heartburn for some Democrats if Republicans manage to force a vote.
Of the 50 Senate Democrats, 12 voted for the tax cut, and 6 of those are up for re-election. Among them are Senator Max S. Baucus of Montana, chairman of the Finance Committee, and Senator Tim Johnson, Mr. Daschle's fellow South Dakotan.
Mr. Baucus, his spokesman said, does not think the Senate is likely to pass a tax cut extension but would support the bill if it came to a vote. 
Mr. Johnson believes the economy has deteriorated since he supported the tax cut last year, and though he has not ruled out voting to make it permanent, he would not be inclined to, his spokesman said.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Narrows His Criticism To Pataki's Rebuilding Efforts 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY

DATELINE: BRIGHTON, N.Y., April 18 

 BODY:
Under fire for criticizing Gov. George E. Pataki's performance after Sept. 11, Andrew M. Cuomo appeared to temper his remarks today, focusing instead on what he described as Mr. Pataki's sluggish efforts to plan the rebuilding of downtown Manhattan. Mr. Cuomo argued that was reflective of Mr. Pataki's "lack of leadership" on a series of problems confronting the state.
 The Democratic gubernatorial candidate, on a campaign swing across western New York, continued to say that he believed Rudolph W. Giuliani had "demonstrated greater leadership" than Mr. Pataki after the attack. "I mean, he's been named man of the year by Time magazine, he's been feted internationally for his display of leadership. He's been knighted, I believe," Mr. Cuomo said. 
 On Tuesday, Mr. Cuomo belittled Mr. Pataki's actions after the Sept. 11 disaster, saying he was not a leader and "had held a leader's coat." But with Republicans across the state moving to take advantage of what they viewed as a mistake by a first-time candidate for public office, the former federal housing secretary presented his criticism of Mr. Pataki as being based on the governor's stewardship of the rebuilding process, including what Mr. Cuomo noted were the widely criticized efforts by Mr. Pataki to win aid from Washington after the attack.
"New York City, rebuilding downtown Manhattan after 9/11, George Pataki has not shown the leadership," Mr. Cuomo said, when he was asked about his remarks by a local television reporter at a news conference in this Rochester suburb.
"He has not handled negotiations with Washington well," Mr. Cuomo continued. "He doesn't have a plan. He doesn't have a big vision. Seven months later they are still arguing about the committee structure and arranging the table and the seats for the committee that will design the rebuilding plan. It can't take seven months to do this."
As Mr. Cuomo held news conferences across upstate New York devoted to the subject of education, he came under fire for his comments. Leaders of the Uniformed Fire Officers Association, the New York City Correction Officers' Union and the city chapter of the Latino Officers Association all criticized Mr. Cuomo.
For the second consecutive day, Mr. Giuliani held a news conference in the lobby of his office building in Midtown Manhattan to come to Mr. Pataki's defense and to criticize Mr. Cuomo. "It saddened me, because this hasn't been done by anyone and I don't think it should be done," the former mayor said, adding: "I think everyone knows that George Pataki was extremely effective as the leader of our state on Sept. 11, all through September, October, November, whatever you want to define as the period of crisis. It was extraordinary the things that he did."
And Mr. Cuomo's opponent in the Democratic primary, H. Carl McCall, issued a statement that offered a low-key if clear endorsement of Mr. Pataki's handling of the crisis, and an indirect chastisement of his opponent. "The tragedy of Sept. 11 should not be used to score political points," he said. "The collective leadership of all elected officials in the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11 has been appropriately and universally praised. That said, I will continue to be critical of the governor's lack of leadership on a wide variety of other issues affecting New Yorkers over the last eight years."
Mr. Pataki, in an appearance in Manhattan, made statements stressing the nonpartisan reaction of political leaders to the attack, in what aides said was an attempt to invite a contrast with Mr. Cuomo. "Today we are still New Yorkers and we still have to stand together to get through the aftermath of that horrible attack," he said.
Mr. Cuomo continued to try to find a way today to raise questions about how much credit the governor deserves for his handling of Sept. 11, without being perceived as using the tragedy for political gain -- particularly as he sought to praise Mr. Giuliani at Mr. Pataki's expense. "I believe Rudy Giuliani demonstrated greater leadership," Mr. Cuomo said. "I don't believe that is flattering or nonflattering or harsh. It's just meant to be a statement of fact."

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Friday about Andrew Cuomo's criticisms of Gov. George E. Pataki misstated the number of news conferences held by former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to denounce the remarks. It was one, not two.

HEADLINE: Rumsfeld Resists Calls to Build Up Military Forces 

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 18 

 BODY:
Contending that the armed forces have been stretched thin by the campaign against terrorism, senior military officials are urging Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld to expand the forces by 50,000 or more men and women.
 Though George W. Bush criticized the Clinton administration in the 2000 presidential campaign for overextending the military, Mr. Rumsfeld is resisting calls to expand the forces, arguing that the cost is too high. 
 The chiefs of the four services assert that the high pace of war operations in Central Asia combined with heightened security at all military installations across the world and the expansion of military activities into countries like the Philippines and Yemen have put immense stress on the nation's 1.4 million soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines, senior officers said. 
At the same time, the Pentagon has activated more than 80,000 national guard and reserve troops to help in the war effort, requiring many of them to take extended leaves from jobs and, in some cases, to be away from families for months.
Rather than accept requests for added troops, Mr. Rumsfeld has ordered the secretaries of the armed services to eliminate nonessential duties or transfer people to relieve stress on the troops. 
"It is time we begin to reduce our current commitments," Mr. Rumsfeld said in a memorandum to the service chiefs last month.
Even if Congress allocated money, it seems unlikely that the services could immediately attract tens of thousands of recruits, since they have had trouble meeting recruitment quotas in recent years.
The services say there is no evidence that the strains of globe-spanning commitments are hampering the troops' abilities to perform their duties. Early statistics indicate that recruitment and retention are level or slightly up -- a result, senior officers say, of a wave of patriotism stemming from the Sept. 11 attacks. 
But military experts and officials say they expect the services to have problems retaining active duty and reserve troops if the high tempo of war continues for many months, as President Bush has predicted.
"If people are constantly being deployed, they will vote with their feet," said Jayson Spiegel, executive director of the Reserve Officers Association. "At some point the family considerations loom large."
Some senior officials contend that the potential troop shortage could mean that the United States would have trouble mounting a large-scale attack against Iraq while maintaining commitments around the globe.
"We do not have forces to do the missions you have outlined," Gen. Joseph Ralston, the commander of NATO forces and United States troops in Europe, told lawmakers recently when asked if he had the resources to launch an invasion of Iraq while continuing operations in the Balkans and elsewhere.
The Pentagon has not increased the size of the forces since President Ronald Reagan expanded them by more than 140,000 people, to a peak of 2.2 million active duty and full-time guard and reserve troops in 1987. The number has fallen steadily since then, hitting a low of 1,447,000 in 2001. 
Mr. Rumsfeld has told the Army that it can add nearly 5,000 soldiers in the coming year, but the Army secretary, Thomas White, is pushing for 20,000 to 40,000 more than that over the next five years. Air Force officials say they need at least 7,000 and possibly more than 20,000 more airmen; the Marine Corps has requested an increase of 2,400 marines.
While the Navy had declined to provide a specific number, Admiral Vern Clark, the chief of naval operations, has told Congress that increasing the size of the Navy has become one of his top budget priorities. 
The main reason Mr. Rumsfeld is resisting calls for expansion is that the Pentagon's personnel costs are rising sharply, a result of recent improvements in pay and health care benefits. The average annual cost per service member, including training, pay and benefits, has risen to $98,425, from $83,009 five years ago, according to calculations by Stephen Daggett, a military analyst at the Congressional Research Service.
Senior lawmakers say it will be hard to find money for troops this year, even though Congress seems likely to approve President Bush's request for a $48 billion increase in the Pentagon budget. Most of that money will go toward maintaining aging equipment, buying weapons, expanding weapons research and improving health care benefits for retirees, Pentagon officials say.
Nevertheless, Representative Ike Skelton of Missouri, the ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, said he planned to push legislation that would add several thousand troops by 2003. 
"They don't have enough resources to meet their missions," Mr. Skelton said in an interview. "Young men and women are stretched pretty hard right now."
While more than 5,000 American troops are in Afghanistan, many thousands more are involved in support operations. 
The greatest demand, however, has been for heightened security at bases and embassies around the globe. Thousands of guardsmen and reservists have been called up to help stand guard at bases and fly patrols over American cities. 
Tech. Sgt. Eric Vega of Woodbridge, Va., for example, is a security guard with 459th Airlift Wing, a reserve unit out of Andrews Air Force Base, who has been on leave from the Virginia state troopers since being activated on Sept. 22.
Though his base pay as a full-time reservist is similar to his police pay, Sergeant Vega estimates that he will lose $25,000 in overtime pay this year. He also is routinely working 14to 18-hour days, leaving him little time to see his 11-month-old twins. 
Sergeant Vega says he expects to re-enlist. But as a career counselor with the 459th, he hears much grumbling from his fellow reservists.
"A lot of my colleagues are fearful of long-term financial effects," he said. "We are definitely going to have a retention problem."

HEADLINE: Suits Over Asbestos 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "Honeywell Says Asbestos Verdict Was More Than It Had Disclosed" (Business Day, April 18): 
 American companies are paying too high a price for problems they did not create. 
Asbestos manufacturers have been picked dry, so now plaintiffs' attorneys are going after large companies, as well as small businesses, that used or sold products that had asbestos without knowing their harmful health effects. 
Companies like Honeywell employ tens of thousands of workers, not to mention the many small businesses that provide goods and services. Their economic future is being threatened by the continuing litany of lawsuits and awards. The number of asbestos claims is projected to go as high as 2.5 million. The Supreme Court has even asked Congress to intervene and come up with a fair system. Congress needs to address this problem before it damages our economy.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Use World Meeting To Focus on Terror Finances 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON and DAVID LEONHARDT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 19 

 BODY:
As protesters streamed into town to greet them, finance ministers from around the world gathered here today to take up proposals for battling terrorism and poverty at a time when the links between the two are increasingly clear.
 Against the backdrop of a strengthening global economy and growing international pressure to address the gap between rich and poor, officials from more than 180 nations descended on the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund for a weekend of negotiation, debate and socializing. 
 They were shadowed by the demonstrators who have made such meetings forums for their views on the inequities of capitalism, as well as other issues, which in this case include Israel's military action against the Palestinians.
The finance ministers' sessions -- scheduled to be shorter and more businesslike than in many previous years -- will address economic trouble spots like Argentina, which ordered all of its banks closed today to avert a run on its financial system, and Japan, which has been suffering for a decade from seemingly intractable financial woes. 
The talks are expected to be dominated by calls from the United States for the world to do more to crack down on the sources of financing for terrorists, as well as by debates among wealthy countries over how best to help the poorest nations.
Hours after the Bush administration ordered the seizure of assets held by nine individuals and a Pakistan-based group, representatives of the big seven industrial democracies plus Russia met tonight to review their progress in cutting off terrorist financing. They then invited officials from a number of other countries, including India, Pakistan, Switzerland, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, to take part.
A report by the International Monetary Fund this week showed that only 40 of its 180 member countries had responded to a request to report steps they are taking to deny suspected terrorists access to money. 
Concerned that their campaign to identify and seize terrorist money could lose steam, American officials have been pressing European governments to be more aggressive, while also looking to help smaller nations step up their efforts. 
"It's getting to the point where more coordination and more work needs to be done," a senior Treasury Department official said today.
Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill used the Group of 7 meeting to press his proposal to funnel more aid to poor countries as outright grants rather than loans from the World Bank. Mr. O'Neill predicted on Thursday that he would have a "testy exchange" with his European counterparts and officials from other countries who are trying to water down his proposal.
A senior Treasury Department official said today that Mr. O'Neill would also be looking progress on his proposal to require developing nations to include clauses in their debt securities to make it easier for governments to negotiate deals with creditors for partial payment in the event of financial trouble.
Top officials of the International Monetary Fund have been pushing a competing proposal that would in effect allow countries to declare bankruptcy and work out their debts under the supervision of the fund.
The meeting comes as nations, rich and poor, are shedding the deference they have shown the United States on economic issues.
The United States is sure to come under criticism for the administration's decision to impose tariffs on imported steel, a step that other governments said showed that Washington is more interested in domestic political concerns than in the principles of free trade.
Washington is also coming under pressure from the monetary fund to do something to address the United States' current account deficit, a broad measure of trade and investment flows. The fund's chief economist, Kenneth Rogoff, identified the deficit this week as one of the primary risks to global economic stability.
The current account deficit has been running at about 5 percent of gross domestic product, a level that in other countries has often led to a collapse in the currency. Administration officials dismissed the fund's concern, saying the deficit primarily reflected the attractiveness of the United States as a place to invest.
In a speech today at Georgetown University, Lawrence H. Summers, treasury secretary in the Clinton administration and now president of Harvard University, said the benefits of globalization could be undone if capital and educated people flow out of developing countries. 
During an earlier spurt of globalization, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, European investments helped build the transcontinental railroad in the United States and other infrastructure everywhere from Argentina to Australia, he said.
Today, by contrast, medical students leave the Philippines to work in the United States and Russians invest in Western Europe.
The efforts to promote economic growth in poor countries, Mr. Summers said, are "the central challenge of our time."
The weekend's largest planned protests were scheduled for Saturday and Sunday, covering a wide range of issues and political perspectives. There were scattered gatherings of demonstrators today, despite intermittent heavy rain, and early this evening police arrested about 40 people who had been riding bicycles through downtown Washington chanting slogans like "No more blood for oil."
"As Americans, we have a great responsibility for how the foreign-policy makers are spending our tax dollars," said Eric LeCompte, who was among a group protesting the United States' military involvement in Latin America. "And, clearly, with what's happening in the world right now, these foreign-policy makers have been irresponsible and negligent with our tax dollars."

HEADLINE: Phone Betting in New Jersey Is Near as Racing Dispute Ends 

BYLINE:  By LAURA MANSNERUS 

DATELINE: OCEANPORT, N.J., April 19 

 BODY:
A betting-by-phone system should be in place in New Jersey by the fall of 2003, state officials said today in announcing the settlement of a legal dispute in the racing industry.
 The dispute had delayed the expansion of betting on horse races outside racetracks, a measure approved by voters in a statewide referendum four years ago. The new telephone system and off-track betting parlors, which will not be open until next year at the earliest, are meant to sustain an industry that has lost revenue to off-track betting operations in New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Maryland. 
 Gov. James E. McGreevey, who announced the agreement at the Monmouth Park Racetrack here, called the industry "an economic engine for the state" and "a precious resource."
Although the legislation authorizing the new systems was enacted in 2000, the state could not set them up until the groups representing owners and breeders of thoroughbreds and standardbreds, which are used in harness racing, could agree on the number of racing days and the allocation of revenues.
The two groups, the Thoroughbred Horsemen's Association and the Standardbred Breeders and Owners Association, reached the agreement in negotiations that included the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, which owns the state's two largest tracks, at Monmouth Park and the Meadowlands.
The thoroughbred industry wanted more racing days and a bigger share of the purses, or prize money. But the larger standardbred industry objected. Harness racing is the core business at the Meadowlands, North America's highest-grossing track.
The agreement adds 21 thoroughbred racing days, bringing the total to 141 at the two tracks. Monmouth Park will open May 11, rather than on Memorial Day, and its season will run through Labor Day. The Meadowlands season runs from Labor Day until Nov. 23.
George Zoffinger, the sports authority president, said, "There will be a number of racing days in the fall when purses will not be as high as we would like to see them."
Mr. Zoffinger and Bruce H. Garland, the authority's senior vice president for racing, also said that the authority expected lower attendance at the parks. But higher revenue from off-track betting would more than offset losses, they said.
Mr. Garland said that according to sports authority projections, when all the betting parlors are in place, in five to seven years, the total new revenue for the sports authority could reach $10 million a year. Racing is already the authority's largest source of revenue.
The telephone betting will be run by the authority. It allows viewers to set up accounts, watch races on a cable television channel and call in bets. Mr. Garland said the authority's goal was to have the system in place before the Breeders' Cup race, held annually in late October.
He said the first betting parlors could not open before late 2003. There are to be 15 parlors eventually.
While losing wagering revenue to off-track betting in other states, the industry has also slipped to a distant third, behind casinos and the lottery, in New Jersey. As the industry slumped in the last few years, racing at the Atlantic City Raceway was cut significantly, and the Garden State Park track in Cherry Hill closed last May.

HEADLINE: Politics Kills Momentum of Madagascar Job Boom 

BYLINE:  By HENRI E. CAUVIN 

DATELINE: ANTANANARIVO, Madagascar, April 17 

 BODY:
The political turmoil gripping this country for weeks has produced an ominous side effect: It has knocked flat a booming garment industry serving American retailers.
 Until late last year, Madagascar had seemed to be on its way up from one of the lowest rungs on the world prosperity ladder. A new American law cutting quotas and duties on clothing from dozens of poor African countries had swung the door to the United States wide open in 2000. 
 Before many of its neighbors knew what was happening, Madagascar was making itself at home in the world's largest market, tripling its exports to America in less than two years. Big retailers like Target and the Gap were placing sizable orders for apparel, and the prospects for the country looked encouraging. 
Then came an election on Dec. 16 that left the country with two men claiming to be president and an economic crisis that is fast eroding the country's remarkable gains.
When anger over the election boiled over early this year, widespread strikes hammered the manufacturing sector, which is concentrated around Antananarivo, the capital. The city, loyal to one candidate, found itself blockaded by militias loyal to the other, making it all but impossible for the country's apparel factories to operate.
Many could not lay hands on raw materials like fabric, which is largely imported. The plants that could still make finished goods could not get them out of landlocked Antananarivo to a port to be shipped abroad. 
"Nobody in their right mind in the U.S. would place an order to go to Madagascar now, not at this time," said a buying agent who has dealings in the country.
The World Bank estimates that Madagascar, a former French colony of about 16 million people in the Indian Ocean east of Mozambique, is losing $12 million to $14 million a day because of the turmoil -- a huge loss for an economy of just under $4 billion, where 70 percent of the people live in poverty. With many orders canceled and no new ones materializing, the manufacturers are shutting and, if they can, shifting work to sister plants in other countries.
Workers do not shift so easily, and thousands have been laid off, many of them in the last few days. On an island as poor as it is vast, the effects will be punishing, and they will almost surely outlast the political crisis. 
When the December balloting did not appear to deliver a majority to either the incumbent president, Didier Ratsiraka, or to Marc Ravalomanana, a businessman and mayor of the capital, a runoff seemed to be the next step. But Mr. Ravalomanana said he had been cheated out of an outright victory, rejected a runoff and declared himself elected. 
Amid escalating violence between the rival camps, the two men traveled to Senegal for negotiations this week. On Thursday, they signed an agreement that lays the groundwork for an interim government that could begin to ease the country's troubles. 
Even so, a new election to decide the dispute is probably months away, and as long as the political situation remains tumultuous, the country's once-bright manufacturing future is very cloudy. 
"We have no more salary, but we still have expenses -- we must buy some food," Haja Andrianajaina, 30, a garment inspector at the Pret Export factory, said last week, a few hours before the plant closed. "It's not possible to find another job."
The factory, down to one-quarter of its former staff of 700, was trying to finish up one last order -- 4,500 pairs of red shorts for the Target chain in the United States.
Orders like that, replicated hundreds of times, were just what was intended when President Clinton signed the African Growth and Opportunity Act into law almost two years ago. African countries that pursued democracy and free-market policies would be exempted from duties and quotas on many goods exported to the United States, especially textiles and apparel.
By the time the law took effect near the end of 2000, nearly three dozen countries south of the Sahara had qualified, many of them after a great deal of work to bring their customs and other regulations into compliance with the law.
Madagascar was one of the leaders, and it burst out of the gate with a flourish. Investors came from China, India and even Mauritius to take advantage of the new law, inexpensive labor and longstanding export incentives here. The factories they opened expanded the industrial base and helped push Madagascar's exports to America, just $80 million in 1999, up to $271 million in 2001, much of it apparel. At last the country's vanilla industry, the world's largest, had to share some of the commercial spotlight.
Though its economy grew at a hearty 7 percent rate last year, Madagascar remains one of the world's poorest places, and real prosperity for most of its citizens is still a long way off. But the garment boom was a start, said Raharijaona-Harimanana Harilandy, a 31-year-old stitching supervisor. "It's really helped Madagascar because it's reduced the number of unemployed people," she said. "Now they will be unemployed again." 
The minimum wage is about $25 a month, and the labor force is not well organized, making the country attractive to employers in the labor-intensive apparel business but especially vulnerable when something goes awry. 
"You have people who, even when they were working, were earning only $40 or $50 a month," said Hafez Ghanem, the country director here for the World Bank. "They were in poverty, and now they are going into deep poverty." 
The longer the country's political crisis drags on, the harder it may become to draw the garment orders and the jobs they create back to Madagascar again. 
"I believe we can convince the buyers," said P. M. Yousuf, the general manager of Pret Export, "but definitely it will take some time."

United Airlines Posts Loss In Tough Week for Carriers
UAL, the parent of United Airlines, reported a first-quarter loss of $510 million, capping a torturous three months for air carriers in which travelers continued to stay away. UAL's revenue declined 26 percent.
 The eight largest carriers have reported first-quarter losses of $2.5 billion combined, compared with $3.2 billion of losses for the fourth quarter. No industry was hit harder after Sept. 11, and no company has struggled more than United. Like its rivals, United is coping with the drop in passengers, but it is also trying to win concessions from employees who own a majority of its shares. Page C4. 

Japan Claims the Fastest Computer
A Japanese laboratory has built the world's fastest computer, a machine so powerful that it matches the raw processing power of the 20 fastest American computers combined and far outstrips the previous leader, an I.B.M.-built machine. The achievement is an indication that a technology race American engineers have generally thought they were winning handily is far from over. A1.

Boeing Wins Korean Jet Contract
South Korea awarded a $4.4 billion contract for fighter jets to Boeing, a decision based in part on the country's long alliance with the United States. The plane made by the other finalist, Dassault Aviation of France, scored slightly better in evaluations but the difference was not enough to offset political considerations. C3.

Europe Files an Auction Complaint
More than a year after American authorities found that the art auction houses Christie's International and Sotheby's Holdings had engaged in price-fixing, European officials have leveled essentially the same charge. C3.

Protests at Washington Meetings
Against the backdrop of a strengthening economy and growing pressure to address the gap between rich and poor, officials from around the world are meeting in Washington at the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. But their discussions have been shadowed by protesters who have used the meetings to make known their views on the inequities of capitalism. A4.

Blue-Chip Stocks Edge Higher
Blue-chip stocks rose slightly, but a warning of possible terrorist attacks against banks halted a rally and left the broad market flat and technology shares down. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 51.83 points, to 10,257.11. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index finished up 0.70 of a point, at 1,125.17, and the Nasdaq fell 5.60 points, to 1,796.83. C4.

President of Enron Resigns
Under pressure from some of Enron's creditors, Jeffrey McMahon, left, resigned as president and chief operating officer. Mr. McMahon had won praise after he told investigators that he had objected to the off-balance-sheet partnerships that led to Enron's collapse. But in recent weeks, creditors have begun questioning his role in deals at Enron that helped hide losses or inflate profits. C2.

In a decision that ends a feud between Enron and the Labor Department, a judge has removed Enron executives as trustees of the employee pension plans and has ordered the hiring of an independent money manager. C2.

Back Wages for Garment Workers
A judge has ordered an apparel company in American Samoa to pay $3.5 million to hundreds of workers who made as little as $2.25 an hour. The ruling has embarrassed American Samoa, a United States territory that had tried to attract garment factories. A14.

NTT Plans to Cut 17,000 Jobs
Two weeks after reporting a $6.7 billion loss, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone has announced an effort that would cut 17,000 jobs and make it profitable by 2005. C3.

The Argentine government ordered an indefinite halt to all foreign exchange and banking transactions, saying it needed time to finalize a plan aimed at bolstering its crumbling financial system. C3.

HEADLINE: Favorable Earth Day Omens 

 BODY:
Congress must have been in an Earth Day frame of mind this week. The Senate dealt a smashing blow to the Bush administration's attempt to permit oil and gas drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Meanwhile the House, in an unusual bow to rationality and the environment, voted to restrict subsidies to the nation's biggest farmers and use the savings on conservation programs. 
 The proposal to permit drilling in the refuge was part of an energy bill now making its tortuous way through Congress. The legislators, their eyes on the elections, are determined to pass some sort of legislation lest they be blamed for higher fuel prices and the nation's failure to lessen its dependency on Middle Eastern oil. The best that can be said about the bill taking shape in the Senate, however, is that it will do no great harm. It is a timid little mixture of tax incentives and conservation targets, preferable to the obscene industry giveaways in the House bill but of no real use in terms of decreasing our reliance on the Saddam Husseins of this world. The Senate saw to that when it rejected stronger fuel economy standards. 
 That vote, in turn, was due largely to the labor unions, which convinced Democratic senators that a vote for fuel efficiency would be seen as a vote against workers. Since then, the unions seem to have exhausted their influence. On Thursday, hours before the wildlife refuge vote, the Senate rejected, 64 to 36, an outrageously cynical attempt to exploit the fears of retired steelworkers by earmarking part of the drilling profits to pay the retirees' health benefits. 
While the Senate vote is definitely worth celebrating, it's important to note that this is not the end of the drilling issue. The oil companies and their friends in the administration continue to cast a covetous eye on other sensitive areas where drilling would be inappropriate, including parts of the Rocky Mountain Front in Montana, the Utah canyonlands and the Otero Mesa region in New Mexico.
The Republican-dominated House, meanwhile, deserves praise for its surprising doctrinal shift on the farm bill. The bill is now in a conference committee. The Senate version, while far from real reform, sets a subsidy limit of $275,000 per farmer and dedicates the savings to conservation programs that would be available to farmers big and small. The House version is an outright capitulation to the large commodity growers, perpetuating the fat subsidies that have been around since the New Deal. A ceiling on subsidies has also been sought by the White House, as well as family farmers who argue that government payouts encourage the corporatization of American agriculture. 
On Thursday, however, the House as a whole, by a 265-to-158 margin, instructed its conferees to accept the Senate limits -- freeing $1.3 billion in extra money for wetland restoration, wildlife protection and farmland preservation programs.
Whether the House conferees listen to their colleagues is another matter; nearly all are captives of the farm lobby. But the vote ought to stiffen the spine of the Senate negotiators, not least the majority leader, Tom Daschle, and beyond that it signals an important shift in thinking from the old subsidy mindset toward a philosophy more hospitable to smaller farmers and conservation. Only the fearsome clout of the big growers and the indifference of urban and suburban Americans have allowed the present irrational system to continue as long as it has. The House action suggests that the moment of real reform is right around the corner.

HEADLINE: UAL Loses $510 Million, as Upturn Is Only a Glimmer 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WONG

 BODY:
The UAL Corporation, the parent company of United Airlines, reported a wider first-quarter loss yesterday, capping a torturous three months for the airline industry in which business and leisure travelers continued to avoid flying because of the Sept. 11 attacks and the general economic downturn.
 UAL posted a net loss of $510 million, or $9.22 a share, compared with a net loss of $313 million, or $5.97 a share, a year earlier. Revenue declined 26 percent, to $3.29 billion. 
 Excluding $52 million in costs to close Avolar, its business-jet unit, $29 million in proceeds from selling shares of the Cendant Corporation and an accounting change, UAL had a loss of $487 million, or $8.81 a share. On that basis, analysts had expected UAL to report a loss of $10.24 a share, Thomson Financial/First Call said. But the latest results are still a huge blow to UAL, which ended last year with a $2.1 billion loss, the largest in airline history. 
Eight of the country's nine largest carriers reported first-quarter losses this week that totaled nearly $2.5 billion, compared with $3.2 billion of losses for the fourth quarter last year. The AMR Corporation, the parent company of American Airlines, reported the biggest loss -- $575 million, or $3.71 a share.
No industry was hit harder after the Sept. 11 attacks, and no company within the industry has struggled more than United, the country's second-largest carrier. Like its competitors, United is coping with a large decline in the lucrative business travel market, which is only now showing hints of recovery. At the same time, its executives are trying to win concessions from a labor force that owns a majority of the company's shares and has for decades opposed cuts in salaries and benefits.
"We certainly are seeing signs that our industry's situation is beginning to improve, but there is still a long way to go," John W. Creighton, UAL's chief executive, said in a written statement yesterday. "We've reduced our operating and capital budgets in every way possible, boosted our cash position, and we are focused on generating revenue with all means available to us. However, complications with negotiating labor contracts have impeded our progress in reducing salary and other operating costs."
United has been hesitant to push hard for concessions from its employees until it reaches a contract settlement with a union representing 23,000 baggage handlers and customer service workers.
On the revenue-generation front, the company raised scattered leisure fares by $20 on Tuesday night, a move that was matched by Northwest. But the increase was not as bold as that of American Airlines, the country's largest carrier, which raised leisure fares across the board by $20 on Wednesday. The move was matched by late afternoon yesterday by Delta, Continental and US Airways, said Tom Parsons, chief executive of Bestfares.com, which sells discounted tickets.
Last week, Continental tried the same $20 systemwide increase. Several airlines followed suit but retreated to lower fares after Northwest refused to raise its fares. That company, along with United, has yet to announce a systemwide increase.
Although demand for seats will undoubtedly increase this summer as the major airlines continue to fly at lower capacities, experts debate whether potential passengers -- especially those business travelers who have turned to cut-rate airlines during the economic slump -- will be willing to pay higher prices. 
"Part of the problem with airline pricing today is that various carriers have some very serious beliefs," Rono J. Dutta, president of UAL, said yesterday in a conference call with analysts. "So we're looking for a middle ground right here."
UAL did show some signs of a financial upswing, especially in its improved cash-burn rate. In the first quarter, the rate dropped to less than $5 million a day, half of what it was in the fourth quarter. UAL ended the first quarter with $2.9 billion cash in hand, $300 million more than at the end of the fourth quarter.
"It's still scary times for everybody," said Glenn D. Engel, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs. "But as the industry recovers, United will participate. I think there has been some more skepticism of United than of other airlines because of its labor problems, but I think that's unwarranted."
United executives have invited the leaders of the airline's six unions to meet on Monday at the company's headquarters in the Chicago area to discuss "the employee part of the recovery plan," meaning belt-tightening, said Jake Brace, the chief financial officer.
"We recognize that the challenge for the industry is to get our revenues and our costs in line, and we need to have those frank discussions with our unions regardless," he said.
Mr. Brace said UAL was considering the option of applying for a federal loan guarantee, which would give it more negotiating power over unions. The deadline is June 28. "It may be useful," he said. "It may be part of the financial recovery plan."
Shares of UAL rose 16 cents yesterday, to $15.

HEADLINE: Helping Citizens Conserve Their Own Land -- and America's 

BYLINE:  By Gale A. Norton; Gale A. Norton is secretary of the interior.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
In 1996, when Kimberly de Castro bought a small ranch in San Jose, N.M., that had been badly damaged by overgrazing and destruction of wetlands, she set to work healing the land. With the help of a small federal grant, she planted thousands of trees and shrubs, sowed native plants, placed tons of straw bales with grass seed in eroded areas and developed a five-mile drip-irrigation system to provide water for the new plants. The success of her restoration work has made it possible to raise honeybees on the land -- an operation that produces 100 gallons of honey every year for donation to local charities.
 Ms. de Castro persuaded 10 of her neighbors to bring conservation to their 5,000 acres by seeding eroded lands, repairing outdated water structures (once used for cattle operations) to support wildlife, restoring small wetlands, setting aside conservation easements and planting native trees and shrubs for wildlife habitat. She also worked with local school districts to bring in schoolchildren for field trips to learn about taking care of the land. 
Without realizing it, Ms. de Castro was joining thousands of other Americans who have quietly given birth to a new recognition of the land ethic in America, a new environmentalism rooted in the concept of citizen conservationists who take upon themselves the care of the land -- while still living on that land and working it.
Monday is Earth Day, and there will be speeches and programs around the country assessing our national progress since environmentalism first reached a high place in the public's consciousness. We have addressed many of the most dramatic and visible issues: the bald eagle on the verge of extinction, the Cuyahoga River on fire, the smokestacks belching fumes in our cities. Now we are facing the more subtle and difficult problems of balancing a growing population's increasing demands on the land with the need to conserve our lands for future generations.
Americans tend to think big. So 50 acres, or even 5,000 acres, may not sound like much in the context of the entire country. The impact of Ms. de Castro's efforts may not seem significant compared with the effects of landmark laws like the Clean Water Act or the Clean Air Act.
But measuring our success in protecting the environment isn't simply a matter of looking at how many laws we have enacted. Success is measured by real conservation and restoration on the ground -- one acre at a time. These are activities that can be set in motion by the people who live on and work the land. Success also involves replacing conflict and confrontation with partnerships involving scientists, neighbors and the government.
In his 2003 budget, President Bush has proposed $100 million in grants under his Cooperative Conservation Initiative to support this concept of a new environmentalism. Landowners all over America will use these grants as a springboard for the kind of work Ms. de Castro has done on her property. An additional $60 million in grants will be distributed under the Landowner Incentive Program and Private Stewardship Grant Program.
In Vermont, for example, citizens concerned about the declining health of the White River watershed have formed "stream teams" to adopt 150 to 200 miles of river frontage. With the help of a federal grant, they have completed more than 20 restoration projects throughout the watershed -- everything from replanting eroded stream banks to putting up fences to keep out livestock.
In South Dakota, Terry Howard, a rancher, used a federal grant and the help of biologists from the Fish and Wildlife Service to restore 320 acres of farmland to native grassland that can be used by both livestock and prairie wildlife.
We are at a time when we must move beyond command-and-control and punitive approaches. The goal of government must be to empower people to be citizen conservationists while respecting the need to make a living off the land. America's future must include both a healthy environment and a dynamic economy.
Wade Robertson, a Texas landowner who restored prairie grouse habitats on his property with the help of a federal grant, summed up this approach to a member of my staff. "Thank you for empowering us to help ourselves," he said.
The great conservationist Aldo Leopold once encouraged Americans to make a personal commitment to conservation. "A conservationist is one who is humbly aware that with each stroke he is writing his signature on the face of the land," he wrote. We must take his vision -- and Kimberly de Castro's -- and make it a reality.

HEADLINE: Themes For an Opposition 

BYLINE:  By BILL KELLER; E-mail: billkeller@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Democratic presidential hopefuls appearing at a party pageant last weekend in Florida declared they were ready to come out of hiding and play the role of loyal opposition. They could have sat back and waited until the schizoid Bush administration beat itself to a pulp, but that would have been too easy. It's time to speak up, they said. It's time to be bold, they said.
 "Never, never, never, never, never, never give up," said Al Gore, mauling a line of Churchill's. (Mr. Gore presumably had not yet taken that sentiment to heart when he gave up on seeking a statewide recount in Florida in the endless November of 2000.) 
 But if the Democrats insist on speaking up, isn't it fair to ask that they have something interesting to say? I read the speeches of the various early contenders in Florida and they consisted mainly of recycled themes from campaigns past -- saving Social Security (yes, they dragged out the old lockbox), protecting the environment, broadening access to health care, and Robin-Hooding the rich. These are all entirely worthy themes, perhaps more applicable now than last time around. But bold? 
The last Democrat elected to the White House was propelled by some fresh thinking and a willingness to stand up to favorite constituencies on issues like welfare reform, spending discipline and free trade. For the Democrats to recapture the benumbed American electorate again, they need to say more than "We were right last time."
For instance? Here are four populist thoughts harvested from a single week of news, opportunities for Democrats to steal political advantage where the Bush administration is blinkered and vulnerable. And they require only an over-the-counter dose of that much-prescribed boldness.
Take the high ground on capital punishment. When political discussion turns to issues of law and order, Democrats feel a desperate need to splash themselves with testosterone. One of my more dispiriting moments in the 2000 presidential campaign was that exchange in the third Bush-Gore debate when Mr. Gore tried to sound as execution-friendly as the Death Row King himself. (Hands up, everyone who believes Mr. Gore really, truly favors the death penalty.) 
A gutsy Republican governor, George Ryan of Illinois, has now pointed the way to a moral high ground that happens to be politically tenable, too. Mr. Ryan appointed a commission rich in courtroom experience to study the state's practice of capital punishment, and this week it produced a clearheaded (and surprisingly readable) document. The report inventories the arbitrary and error-prone system that puts people -- sometimes the wrong people -- on death row. It proposes a menu of reforms, among them videotaping interrogations to prevent dubious confessions, expanded use of DNA testing and diminishing reliance on single-witness or stool-pigeon accounts. Democrats should press for a nationwide moratorium on executions pending real reforms to minimize the risk of killing people by mistake. (Bills to accomplish some of these things are becalmed in Congress. The White House is studiously noncommittal.)
Real boldness would be to join a narrow majority of the Illinois commission, and the rest of the civilized world, in disavowing the death penalty as a barbaric practice. But the Ryan commission offers a political halfway house for the less courageous. "Repair or repeal," said Thomas P. Sullivan, the former prosecutor and co-chairman of the Illinois commission. "Fix the capital punishment system or abolish it. There is no other principled recourse." 
Steal the tax issue. David Cay Johnston, the astute tax reporter for The Times, often tells audiences that on taxes, "Republicans have an agenda, Democrats don't have a clue." Here's a clue.
Democrats can never outflank the Republicans on tax-cutting, and our simple-minded political discourse intimidates anyone who might favor raising taxes. But whatever happened to the idea of simplifying taxes? The voluminous tangle of the tax code gets its annual CNN moment during our mid-April filing ordeal, but it is a year-round corruption of the political system as pernicious as, say, campaign fund-raising. The tax code is a watering hole for special interests, and it corrodes popular faith in government. Because of well-intentioned gimmicks like the earned-income tax credit, education savings accounts and refundable child credits, low-income families suffer mystifying paperwork along with the rich, except they can ill afford professional help.
The idea of radically simplifying the tax system remains an orphan issue because (a) it's almost impossible to rejigger taxes without someone paying a little bit more, and the losers hire lobbyists; (b) all politicians love the game of making things happen with tax credits, because you get to be both a social engineer and a tax-cutter; and (c) it has tended to be a pet project of ideology-driven Republicans like Steve Forbes, whose real agenda was to cut taxes and starve the government.
Suppose a candidate announced that immediately upon election he would create a high-powered, bipartisan commission and give it one year to design a blueprint for radically simpler taxes. The objective would be a tax code most Americans could understand without an economics degree and comply with in a couple of hours. No hidden agendas: the mandate would be to leave the government neither bigger nor smaller and to shift the burden as little as possible from one category of taxpayer to another.
"Everyone perceives this as a more natural issue for Republicans," says Scott Hodges of the Tax Foundation, which has been beating its head against this wall for half a century. "But running against the I.R.S. ought to be like running against Enron."
Dust off Dr. Strangelove. Democrats struggle with a soft-on-defense reputation, and even those with warrior credentials would be loath to challenge the Pentagon in wartime. Thus Democrats have mostly stifled their misgivings about missile defense. They have shied away from military reform, wedding themselves as shamelessly as Republicans to unneeded military bases and pork-barrel defense contracts.
But hey, did you read this paper's interview the other day with Lt. Gen. Ronald T. Kadish of the Missile Defense Agency? The one where he said Pentagon leaders "don't rule out" putting nuclear tips on our ballistic missile interceptors? Did it make your skin crawl?
It should. It was just the latest indication that the Pentagon is edging toward a radical redefinition of nuclear weapons, from a last-resort force for deterring enemies to just another tool in the toolbox. The military is also looking at bunker-busting atom bombs and other nuclear novelties. 
A sober, thoughtful critic might explain that, when one of the greatest threats to our homeland security is the proliferation of nuclear technology that could fall into terrorist hands, inventing new workaday uses for atomic explosives is, um, counterproductive. A candidate in campaign mode might reach for something less measured, like, "ARE THEY OUT OF THEIR MINDS?!" 
Kick out Castro. No, not out of Cuba. Out of the driver's seat of our policy in Latin America, where he's been hogging the wheel for nearly half a century.
The Bush White House is getting properly pilloried for prematurely celebrating that short-lived coup in Venezuela last weekend; some suspect that, by a wink and a nod, it actually encouraged the military overthrow of the democratically elected populist Hugo Chavez. And just when some people were starting to think the president had his unilateralist demons under control!
There are lots of reasons to feel queasy about Mr. Chavez, but what really seems to have set the administration's knee to jerking was his affinity for Fidel Castro. So once again we are hostage to the bearded bogeyman. Bad enough that our trade embargo and travel ban give the old Stalinist windbag an excuse for the sorry state of his country. Bad enough that we isolate his subjects from the business partners and role models who could support Cubans' yearning for freedom. The aggressive ostracism of Castro also insults all of our Latin American friends, whose views on this subject we ignore and whose relations rate less of our attention. Sorry, no help for ailing Argentina; there's no Castro angle there. 
Democrats muffle themselves out of fear of the right-wing Miami Cuban minority that wags the dog of Florida's 25 electoral votes. But a proposal for an opening aimed at preparing Cubans for the post-Castro era might peel some Cuban-Americans away from the zealots. (The way the Bush administration is bleeding Social Security, a Democrat might well survive Florida next time without the Cuban-Americans.)
A Democrat who proposed lifting the embargo, that ultimate macho symbol of our disapproval, would be taking a risk. But he would win favor in farm states where politicians are dying for a new market. He could pick up support among non-Cuban Latinos who are tired of being overshadowed. 
He might even establish a people-pleasing reputation for doing that thing presidents are supposed to do -- leading.

HEADLINE: $7.3 Billion Vision To Rebuild Transit Near Ground Zero 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT and RANDY KENNEDY

 BODY:
An overhaul of the shattered tangle of subway and commuter trains in Lower Manhattan could cost more than $7 billion, four times the amount currently allocated for downtown transportation improvements, a group of high-level New Yorkers told Congress this week.
 The New York officials went to Washington on Thursday to try to convince skeptical legislators that properly rebuilding Lower Manhattan's transportation system will require much more than simply repairing what was destroyed. It was the first time that the city and state have delivered a definitive list of their transit plans, with price tags and priorities attached. 
 Elements of the ambitious proposal, outlined to House and Senate staff members helping to plan appropriations of President Bush's $21.5 billion pledge to New York, include a relocated PATH commuter train terminal, a new subway hub at Fulton Street, a redesigned South Ferry terminal and multiple links between subways, ferries and buses. 
The message was this: rebuilding the wounded center of Lower Manhattan must begin with the transit system, not only to allow New Yorkers to travel to and through downtown to their offices and homes, but also to accommodate the millions of visitors who are certain to flock each year to the memorial to victims of the World Trade Center disaster. 
The New York officials, including Peter S. Kalikow, chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Joseph J. Seymour, executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and Louis R. Tomson, president of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, admit that they are facing an uphill fight.
The $7.3 billion request is four times the $1.8 billion that President Bush proposed for transportation repairs last month when he raised the federal government's total pledge to New York to $21.5 billion, from the $20 billion promised in the days immediately after Sept. 11.
But the New York officials insist that they do not need that total pool of money to be increased. Rather, they would like to have money earmarked for disaster cleanup reallocated to rebuilding projects, specifically ones involving transportation.
The transportation plans could create an uncomfortable situation for the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, which is overseeing the rebuilding process. Just days after it issued a blueprint for rebuilding the city that promised "an open and inclusive public process," city and state officials privately put together a detailed transportation plan, parts of which are likely to face opposition.
Delegation members and others in Washington said they believed Congress would look favorably on the plans. "It has to be shown clearly that the funding is for projects with a direct relationship to what happened Sept. 11," said Representative James T. Walsh, the Republican congressman who represents Syracuse and nearby areas and is the ranking New York member of the House Appropriations Committee, "but I think there is pretty broad support" to allow money previously earmarked for other uses to go to transportation.
Despite those signs, participants in the process acknowledge that the legislative process is unpredictable, and recalled New York's previous problems in promoting its needs after the attack. 
While Mr. Kalikow said he was "very encouraged" by the meeting, Senator Charles E. Schumer was more cautious. "I wouldn't say it's a done deal, but we have a good chance," he said.
At issue is how to allocate $5.5 billion that President Bush outlined in a March 7 ceremony at the White House. Included in the proposal, which is part of the president's $21.5 billion pledge, was $2.75 billion in disaster relief to be paid through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which has overseen the cleanup of the site; $1.8 billion to repair, replace and upgrade the subway and PATH lines that were destroyed; $750 million to rebuild infrastructure, probably Con Edison and Verizon facilities; and about $170 million to repair roads like the West Side Highway.
The $1.8 billion set aside for transportation is barely enough to rebuild the PATH, whose station under the trade center was destroyed, city and state officials said. More is needed to repair the subway, and much, much more would be required to modernize the haphazard array of subway lines and underground connections underneath the financial district.
The Port Authority and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority are receiving some insurance money, but it is being used to rebuild only what was damaged, such as the 1 and the 9 lines' tunnel, and not to pay for new projects. 
New York officials want Congress to let them use money previously allocated to the Federal Emergency Management Agency or for community development block grants to rebuild and improve transportation. 
At the top of the new project list is $2 billion to build what officials call a downtown Grand Central near Church Street, adjacent to the former World Trade Center site. The station would connect PATH trains with three subway lines and would include a $500 million underground concourse, stretching from near the ferry docks on the Hudson River beneath the World Financial Center and through the PATH terminal. 
The passageway, which would include moving walkways, would also extend east to a new Fulton Street transit center, a newly designed, $750 million hub. The transit center would straighten out the dispiriting array of pedestrian tunnels that now connect the major subway lines in the area of Broadway, Nassau and Fulton streets; together with the PATH terminal, commuters would have a single complex linking the A, C, E, J, M, Z, N, R, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 9 lines. 
The plan also includes $200 million to study the possibility of an eventual Long Island Rail Road or Metro-North connection to the Lower Manhattan terminals, which would bring suburban commuter lines to the tip of the island. While many transportation officials consider such a connection unlikely in the near term, a consensus has emerged that preparing for the long-term possibility might be worthwhile.
At the southern tip of Manhattan, a $400 million terminal would replace the South Ferry subway station with a new station with four tracks and three platforms that would, for the first time, allow all 10 cars of a train to fit into the station. The terminal would also be linked to the ferry terminals at the Battery.
The plans also call for connecting the Rector Street stations on the 1 and 9 and N and R lines, which are very close together but have never been linked. The $80 million Rector connector, as officials call it, would allow ferry riders who come into the South Ferry station to have another option for transferring to lines to Brooklyn.
Also proposed are $500 million for a new bus terminal near the planned memorial, to handle the heavy tourist traffic that is expected downtown. 
A proposal to move West Street underground, which would provide more surface area for a memorial as well as provide for better pedestrian connections between Battery Park City and the rest of Lower Manhattan, would cost up to $2 billion. 
Finally, transit officials have said that they plan significant security improvements, and have allocated up to $1.4 billion for those efforts.
Construction has already begun on a temporary PATH station and on the restoration of the tunnel for the 1 and 9 subway lines, both of them on the site of the World Trade Center, a development that has angered relatives of some victims. Charles A. Gargano, vice chairman of the Port Authority, said any new transit construction in the trade center area must await a decision on where the memorial or new buildings would be placed. That could mean that PATH terminal construction might not begin for five years, he said.
The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation could also find itself bedeviled by the new list of transportation proposals. While it has gone to great lengths to seek input from advisory committees and civic groups, the new list of projects appears to have emerged from the stereotypical smoke-filled room.
Mr. Tomson, president of the group overseeing the downtown redevelopment, noted that all the projects on the list presented to Congress are in the development corporation's blueprint, released last week.

 A WORKING STIFF'S MANIFESTO
A Memoir.
By Iain Levison.
164 pp. New York:
Soho Press. $22.
 "In the last 10 years, I've had 42 jobs in six states," Iain Levison tells us. He can now add "writer" to a resume that includes film-set gofer, fish cutter, oil truck driver, cook, mover, crab fisherman and 36 other job titles. Anyone who finds these numbers startling probably hasn't put in any time behind a restaurant prep line or a retail counter lately, or has missed reading Barbara Ehrenreich's "Nickel and Dimed" and Ben Cheever's "Selling Ben Cheever," two similar recent first-person chronicles about zigzagging through the lower levels of the American workplace. As Levison notes, "a million others" could have written the same book he has, a claim worth disputing on a literary level only.
"I have become, without realizing it, an itinerant worker, a modern-day Tom Joad," Levison writes, between pungent recountings of his on-the-clock misadventures. This revelation comes as something of a surprise to Levison, who -- fresh out of college and the Army, and ripe with all the correct intentions -- expected something different. "There was an unspoken agreement between me and the Fates that, as I lived in the richest country in the history of the world, and was a fairly hard worker, all these things" -- a house, a wife, a serviceable car, a fenced-in yard -- would just come together eventually." In February, touting his economic proposals, George W. Bush proclaimed that jobs lead to "more independence, more self-esteem and more joy and hope." But while Bush's own job may have provided him those blessings, Levison and millions of other Americans have discovered that hourly jobs lead not to joy or to hope but only to different hourly jobs. "It's surviving," Levison says, "but surviving sounds dramatic, and this life lacks drama. It's scraping by."
To be fair, Levison is often a lousy hire. His overeducation makes him impatient lugging other people's stuff around, even though it qualifies him for little else. From a chi-chi Manhattan grocery he steals as much Chilean sea bass as he can fit into his pants. He cooks the log books on trucking runs, blows up the head of a lawn statue he mistakes for a heating-oil tank by pumping fuel into it, and on job applications he writes "the moon" for where he went to grade school and "compulsive masturbation" for his hobbies. But this last tack, like many of his others, is reactive rather than proactive, to crib from the current corporate parlance. "They'll hire me on nothing but a drug test," he writes, so what's the use? And this, more than anything else, is what chafes him.
Despite scattered grumblings, Levison's beef with his myriad employers isn't about money. "The real problem is with the expendability of us all. One human is as good as the next. Loyalty and effort are not rewarded." 
The last 10 years have supposedly seen the demise of the "Organization Man," the archetype of employee-employer fidelity that William H. Whyte posited in his 1956 classic of that name. The breakdown of that conformist ideology has proved a boon to white-collar workers, enabling them to manage their career arcs far more independently. For the unskilled labor pool, however, it has yielded few rewards. Working the same job all your life may strike many as a nightmare out of the 50's, but for those like Levison it sometimes sounds like a merciful dream. "I have a job," he writes glumly. "Here we go again."
Unlike Ehrenreich and Cheever, who ventured into workplaces as undercover reporters, Levison is the real deal, less a correspondent than a combatant. Levison's account lacks the Michael Harrington-like ambitions of Ehrenreich's book and the writerly savoir-faire of Cheever's, but it bears an immediacy that neither of those authors can quite match. That said, "A Working Stiff's Manifesto" is at times lopsided, knee-jerk and braying; but it is also bracing, hilarious and dead on. "It wasn't supposed to be like this," Levison writes, but if there's naivete involved (and there is), it's a communal naivete. It's called the American Dream.

 JAMES MADISON
By Garry Wills.
184 pp. New York:
Times Books/Henry Holt & Company. $20.
 Eight states had voted yes on the Constitution, one short of ratification, when Virginia's delegates met in Richmond's sultry June heat in 1788. Just as the Constitution's supporters had feared, the Anti-Federalist leader, Patrick Henry, mesmerized the convention delegates with his impassioned attack on a Constitution that "squints toward monarchy."
The Federalists turned to their leader, James Madison, to stanch the negative tide stirred by Henry's assaults. Diminutive (5-foot-4), pale and handicapped by a weak, reedy voice, Madison could not match Henry's rhetorical volleys and, wisely, did not try. But no one knew the intricacies of the Constitution better than Madison, and over the next three weeks he methodically made his case. In the end, the Virginia delegates followed Madison's lead and voted for ratification.
Madison was only 37 years old at the time but he had already composed a brilliant defense of religious liberty, played a pivotal role at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia in 1787 and made an indispensable contribution to a series of essays ("The Federalist") that serve as foundational documents on the United States' constitutional democracy. But it is Madison as the nation's fourth president (1809-17) that is the subject of Garry Wills's short, finely written biography, and his achievements as chief executive are comparatively meager. "How a man could be so shining in certain aspects of his life and so shadowed in another is not a question often asked," Wills writes. He not only poses the question but makes his answer the provocative focus of his book.
At the outset, Wills acknowledges the exemplary work of the young Madison, whose subtle, ingenious political mind has rightfully placed him among the greatest members of the founding generation. Madison's early accomplishments make his presidency all the more disappointing. In fact, historians have generally agreed that as president Madison was no better than average. Wills does not seriously challenge that overall assessment. He nonetheless insists that there are "common traits in the man who planned the government brilliantly but was lackluster in conducting it."
Wills's task in writing a volume in the American Presidents series is made more difficult by the strictures imposed by Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., the general editor, who promises biographies "compact enough for the busy reader, lucid enough for the student, authoritative enough for the scholar." Wills must therefore abandon the successful format of his earlier historical works like "Lincoln at Gettysburg," in which he takes a brief moment in American history and glides eruditely across several intellectual disciplines to provide new insights into his familiar subject. In "James Madison," he must do the inverse: take the eight years of Madison's presidency and distill those years into a pithy, meaningful essence.
Madison's consummate skills of organization and preparation that served him so well in committee and on the floors of the Virginia Legislature and Congress, Wills contends, later undermined his effectiveness as president. Madison thrived in the give-and-take of the legislative process; he knew how to draft bills and devise winning strategies to make them law. But these were not the leadership qualities required for a great chief executive. Madison faltered almost immediately upon entering office, beginning with the selection of his cabinet. In accommodating various political factions within his warring Democratic-Republican Party, Madison created a dysfunctional committee of official advisors, best known (except for Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin, a holdover from the Jefferson administration) for incompetence and disloyalty.
Wills maintains that two of Madison's core traits, his provincialism and his naivete, were responsible for his disastrous foreign policy toward Britain. It was Madison, as Jefferson's secretary of state, who insisted upon the passage of the Embargo Acts to bring commercial pressure on the British to stop the confiscation of American cargo and the impressment of American seamen. The legislation was an abject failure, resulting in an economic recession at home and no visible change in British policy. Still, as president, Madison held fast to his view that the United States could intimidate the British, if not by commercial means then by military might. Wills writes that contrary to the assumptions of many earlier Madison biographers, Madison actually invited the War of 1812 and manipulated Congress to bring it about.
Once war was declared, Madison expected American troops to make a quick strike at the Canadian border and take the British possession as a prize. He badly miscalculated. Wills again attributes Madison's failure here, as in other parts of his strategy to defeat the British, to his provincialism and naivete. But his explanation seems a little too tidy and does not seriously consider the possibility that Madison, provincialism aside, may have acted primarily on the basis of a series of wrong strategic assumptions. In telling the story with such bold narrative strokes, Wills sometimes strains to fit all of Madison's errors into carefully delineated categories. It seems that even Wills himself occasionally tires of his tight categorizing; when he describes the battles of the war, unfettered by categorization, his observations and writing especially glisten.
Madison's finest hour as president occurred as British troops prepared to attack the nation's capital. Given his reputation for weakness, many expected Madison to flee. He not only held his ground but showed extraordinary personal courage, and skill, in supervising the defensive movements of American naval artillerymen and their guns near Washington. It is precisely at this time of acute national crisis, Wills concludes, that Madison's very weakness as president, his "legislative temperament," brought him his greatest triumph. Despite pressures to act alone, Madison refused to resort to dictatorial methods. Nor did he try to strong-arm Congress into passing emergency legislation that would undercut constitutional safeguards. In respecting the civil rights of a citizenry at war, Madison stands above every other wartime chief executive, including two of the nation's greatest presidents, Abraham Lincoln and Franklin D. Roosevelt. The issue of wartime governance is as relevant today in the midst of President Bush's declaration of war on terrorism as it was almost 200 years ago. For this constitutional lesson alone, Wills's stimulating biography offers us a compelling reason to reconsider the presidency of James Madison.

HEADLINE: America in Extremis 

BYLINE:  By Michael Paterniti; Michael Paterniti is the author of "Driving Mr. Albert: A Trip Across America With Einstein's Brain" and a writer at large for GQ magazine.

 BODY:
While visiting Florida one day last summer, I happened upon the following newspaper headline: "Sex-Plane Couple Remains Mystery." The ensuing Miami Herald article detailed an improbable incident featuring a Hispanic couple in their "50's or 60's" who in mid-August chartered a plane out of Key West, ostensibly with the desire to share connubial bliss at altitude. The pilot claimed that his company, Fly Key West (a company not listed in the Florida Division of Corporations), advertised such escapades and that because anonymity was guaranteed and the couple spoke only Spanish, he never knew the full names of those on board. 
 It became a case of coitus interruptus in the most cosmic sense. The plane ditched in 3,600 feet of shark-infested ocean, the couple apparently died (according to the pilot they remained in the plane, unmoving as it sank) and the pilot himself, 36-year-old Thomas Hayashi, was subsequently rescued. When interviewed by investigators, Hayashi claimed that the couple had tried to hijack the plane to Cuba, and in the ensuing scuffle, the throttle had broken. It was a stranger-than-fiction story that many found farfetched, questioning, among other things, whether a couple had actually been on board at all, though an F.B.I. spokesperson said there was nothing to suggest that the pilot was "not telling the truth." 
 The story had everything: sex, intrigue, missing bodies, risky behavior behind a veneer of normalcy, the humid specter of Cuba and capitalism operating at its tawdry finest. I happened to read it on the back porch of the cypress bungalow where Janet Reno lives. She has spent most of her life in Kendall, a satellite of Miami that was once sparsely populated but that today is very much a vision of America itself, all big-car traffic and strip malls. The sun was beating down on the gumbo limbo trees, the day was just turning to sauna and my host had given me a glass of lemonade to keep cool, as the house had no air-conditioning but for the bedroom. 
Reno, the former United States attorney general and the state's most infamous daughter, was soon to announce her candidacy for governor of Florida, and we had been talking about Waco, a subject that I brought up but that she seemed quite eager to discuss. Now she'd gone rummaging for a letter she wanted to show me. It was from John Danforth, the former Republican senator who led a Congressional investigation on how 75 people, including 25 children, had died in a conflagration set by the F.B.I. at David Koresh's Branch Davidian compound in 1993. The personal letter, written by Danforth in January 2001 after he left the Senate, commended Reno's controversial decision-making during the 51-day standoff -- a vindication Reno was quick to share with me. While she went for that letter, I picked up the paper and read the article. 
When she returned, I told her about the sex plane. She may not have wanted to appear too interested, but as the daughter of a crime-beat reporter and herself a former state attorney general who once knew where all the bodies were hidden in these parts, she wanted the details. And while it was just another bizarro mystery tale (one that, to date, hasn't been unraveled), it wasn't quite the stuff of a Versace murder or hanging chads, shark attacks or Elian, the stuff that has turned this state into a bellwether and bane, the national headline and tabloid heart of our nation over the last five years. Still, after absorbing it, Janet Reno smiled behind her glasses -- an enigmatic grin floating six feet in the air -- and with possibly a trace of admiration at the idea that her home still has the power to surprise her after 63 years, said, "Welcome to Florida!" 
Oh, Florida -- fabled land of shady real-estate deals and unclad hotties (the fine MTV youth of America!) bumping and grinding on spring break, of endangered manatees and Miami nightclubs, the ghost of Meyer Lansky and retirees sidling across white-sugar beaches at sunset . . . and how to forget O.J. Simpson, tucked away in his golf-green haven? Hasn't this always been the place where exiles and fugitives, ex-dictators and ex-astronauts -- ex-everyones -- come to erase the past and make themselves new again? 
In the weeks after Sept. 11, the nation began to ask questions of Florida. Television commentators spoke of a "Florida curse," as if the vapors from Atchalafaya Swamp now suddenly carried with them evil spirits and gnats intent on mucking up our democracy. By any measure, it has been perplexing, this bonanza of strange news emanating from that steamy underworld of alligators and mockingbirds. In fact, how can one explain or begin to quantify Florida's recent seismic impact on the news of this country? How does one account for a state in which everything now seems to happen first -- or somehow in the extreme, that as a microcosm of America, has come to reflect the psyche of America itself?
Of the three biggest news stories in the last three years, two of them -- the Elian Gonzalez case and the 2000 presidential election recount -- played out on Florida's pastel-and-neon stage, while the third, the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, immediately had its own unsettling Florida synchronicities with tales of Mohamed Atta and his posse practicing takeoffs (but not landings) in flight simulators in Opa-Locka, receiving actual in-air flight training in Venice, inquiring about crop dusters at Belle Glade municipal airport and boozing at a Hollywood bar, where Atta posed as an airline pilot before embarking on his deadly journey. 
Then, of course, came the first reports of anthrax contamination at -- who scripted this? -- American Media Inc., publishers of The Star, National Enquirer and Weekly World News. Soon more anthrax was found in Boca Raton. As if this all weren't enough, there came a January echo of the tragedy when a teenager apparently sympathetic to Osama bin Laden re-created his own suicidal mise-en-scene by piling a Cessna 172 into a bank building in Tampa. In staging his addled attack, the ninth grader killed himself alone but gave weight -- with the image of the plane's tail fin suspended 28 stories aloft, framed by shattered glass and twisted metal -- to another senseless absurdity somehow implicating American culture at large.
Maybe the feng shui of the place is a little out of whack, recalling a time in the 60's and 70's when California was the site of our concern, with its odd crimes and laissez-faire lack of accountability. In that day, the Hollywood state gave us the assassination of Bobby Kennedy and antiwar foment, Patty Hearst and Charles Manson. It launched Jim Jones and his followers to Guyana and their liquid suicide, and also the actor who became governor who became president. Where Californians often seemed flummoxed by the next day's news, Floridians have come to expect the surreal. And with the first tolling bells of a new election season comes the prospect of more surrealities: a gubernatorial wrangle between the onetime Clintonian, Janet Reno, and the incumbent first brother, Jeb Bush, which could prove to be either Greek drama or an episode of "American Gladiators." In recent polls, Reno bests her Democratic challengers, including Bill McBride, a private-practice attorney and political novice though already a state party and labor union darling. (Of the group, McBride may in fact have the support to make it close.) Her name recognition alone is over 90 percent. And while she lags behind Jeb Bush by 10 to 20 percentage points, it's still early, with an election season as tangled as Spanish moss looming ahead.
For his part, Bush has been fund-raising -- collecting $500,000 at a recent $25,000-a-head country-club event featuring his brother, George W. -- and a large part of his campaign strategy will hinge on a television commercial blitz at election time. And since the presidential election controversy, 36 days that seemed to relegate him to an upstairs closet at the mansion, Jeb has been more and more willing to be seen with George W., whose approval ratings still float in the stratosphere. In Florida, Jeb's own recent approval rating is 58 percent, which leads Democratic state party leaders to believe he may be more vulnerable than he appears, especially since Democrats continue to outnumber Republicans in the state and high voter turnout may create the same element of surprise that it did in the 2000 election.
If a Reno-Bush showdown indeed transpires, and if Bush's numbers slide come November, it may make for grand theater: Reno, the somewhat less than charismatic though controversial native daughter, running to avenge the loss of the vanquished Al Gore, whose hapless fade from public view included the protest beard; and Jeb, oozing roguish wonkiness and piloting a finely honed political machine, whose fortunes now seem all the more inextricably linked with his brother's, running not just to win and lay the backbeat for his brother's own re-election bid in 2004, but to re-establish himself as a national political figure as well.
Recently, I stopped in on Jeb -- and Janet again. In between, I took myself on a 500-mile road trip from Tallahassee, the capital in the north, to Miami, the unofficial capital in the south. I found myself navigating a state that joined the union in 1845 as a mostly uninhabitable, mosquito-infested swamp; a state where, until recent times, "nothing ever really happened," says the poet Campbell McGrath, a transplanted Floridian with a new book about his adopted home titled "Florida Poems." No founding fathers, no presidents born here, only two Civil War battles worth mention, no gold or silver or fantastically arable soil -- no exceptionally famous natives. It is a state that, until the post-World War II advent of air-conditioning and Interstates, was more sleepy Southern colony than capitalist cornucopia. In fact, so transient is Florida's place in our history and landscape, its own founding fathers were real-estate speculators who didn't stick around for long, while an estimated 70 to 80 percent of voting Floridians today were not actually born in the state. 
"Florida ought to be more like Texas, but it isn't," McGrath says. "Texas has the Alamo, we have Alamo rental cars. While it has none of the burdens of history, Florida has no mythic identity, no sense of place or self. Florida is still a new world in the New World." 
Since the 1997 Gianni Versace murder in Miami Beach, a nation has increasingly looked to its fourth-largest state with a gawker's fascination and subdued parental confusion. So long the amorphous vacation spot with a floating population, Florida has emerged as a new prime-time sensation, defined more by the sum of its recent television cameos than by its natural beauty or multicultural panoply, its Disney World extravaganzas or business opportunities. So it has seemed recently: as Florida goes, so goes a nation.
"You could dismantle each of these news stories and say they're all coincidences, that they could have happened elsewhere," says McGrath, who lives in Miami Beach. "But then the anecdotal evidence piles up and you ask, Why here? Why psychopaths and terrorists, upside-down elections and general weirdness? Is it the unrootedness of people, the extraordinariness of the landscape, the lack of seasons that untether you from the past? You do begin to wonder, Is it something in the air?"
Striding into the dining room at the Governor's Mansion for a lunch with the state's Hispanic caucus, Jeb Bush seems very much at ease on this late-winter Tuesday, the halfway point in one of Tallahassee's most rancorous legislative sessions in years. Always boisterous, Florida politics has become what passes as extreme sport in the capital these days. The speaker of the House, Tom Feeney, is no longer talking to the president of the Senate, John McKay; the budget is moving toward complete impasse; and a lobbyist and dog-track owner ended up engaged in fisticuffs in the men's room at the rotunda. Twenty or so representatives, most of them Cuban-Americans from southern Florida, have been mingling with the lieutenant governor and resident cutup, Frank Brogan, awaiting the governor's arrival, and the room receives a palpable surge of electricity when he finally appears. "Boss is here," Brogan says.
Tanned and grinning, Bush, 49, wears a neatly tailored olive suit and a purple tie emblazoned with green elephants, a more psychedelic rendering of his party's traditional mascot. He is tall -- taller by a head than most in the room -- and though his baby-face features, ruddy cheeks and slight double chin leave the impression that he may enjoy dessert, he's surprisingly thin. 
Those close to Jeb Bush describe him as a private man who deeply enjoys the political process, however late he has come to the game, and many believe he may be the post-W. future of his party. Having married his teenage sweetheart, Columba, whom he met as a 16-year-old exchange student in Mexico, Bush moved to Miami in 1981 after attending the University of Texas, where he graduated, like his father, in only two and a half years. He got his start making real-estate cold calls and worked up to partner in the Codina Group, a Miami real-estate development firm, where he pocketed more than $1 million a year. 
In 1994, two years after his father lost the White House, Jeb Bush decided to run for governor, though he ultimately lost to the incumbent, Lawton Chiles. (In the same election year, his brother unseated the incumbent Ann Richards to become governor of Texas.) Jeb Bush's campaign was reportedly disorganized, and one comment in particular did little to endear him to undecided voters: when asked what he might do for black Floridians if elected, he responded testily, "Probably nothing." In 1998, having tried to make amends with black voters and casting himself as more moderate, Bush ran again, in more disciplined fashion, and won handily. 
As opposed to his brother the president, whose managerial style resembles that of a big-picture C.E.O., Jeb can be a hands-on administrator (the two reportedly have a well-honed sibling rivalry that leaves them close or distant, depending on the day and the issue). He is known to fire off e-mail messages in the middle of a Saturday night and fearlessly dive into the nuanced, jargon-filled territory that his brother tends to avoid like a reactor in meltdown. It may seem an unlikely comparison, but in manner, intellect and emotional availability, Jeb less resembles his brother, or even his father, than he does Bill Clinton. And as dazzling as Clinton could be in the living flesh, as much as he genuinely fed off people, he still left the impression of sizing up his company and plugging the world into a grid, each new acquaintance ranked by usefulness. Outwardly, Bush is less the striver, perhaps because he has had to strive less.
If Clinton's personal life fell prey to the tabloids, Bush's has, too. In May of last year at a bill signing, Bush took the unusual measure of addressing a rumor about an alleged affair with Cynthia Henderson, his appointed head of the Florida Department of Management Services. It came just before a supermarket tabloid was supposedly scheduled to break the story. (Ultimately the tabloid did not, but Vanity Fair did, referring to the affair as "a rumor.") Adding pepper to the sauce was the fact that Henderson worked for two years at a St. Petersburg Playboy Club in the 1980's to help pay her way through law school and that her past in government had included the controversial firing of 50 staffers, an accusation that she had assaulted a colleague and an ethically questionable trip to the Kentucky Derby, sponsored by Outback Steakhouse, one of the businesses she was charged to regulate. 
"I have been faithful," said a sullen Bush, his voice cracking. Behind him stood various state agency heads, including Henderson. "I love my wife," he said, labeling the rumor "an outright lie." Had he been the anonymous governor of an empty Western state, people may not have cared to look up from their ribeye. As a scion of the Bush family, he became front-page news.
Partly for this reason, Bush is loath to talk about his personal life, one that has included several noted incidents: in 1999, his wife was fined more than $4,000 for failing to pay duty fees on $19,000 worth of designer clothing bought in Paris; last year, his 16-year-old son was caught by the police having intimate relations with a female teenager in a Tallahassee public parking lot; and in January, his 24-year-old daughter was arrested at a pharmacy near the Governor's Mansion for prescription-drug fraud after posing as a doctor in order to issue herself the anti-anxiety drug Xanax, which led the governor to beg the media for privacy during "this difficult time."
As trying as these revelations have been for the family, they are indeed family matters, and the electorate is likely to ignore them at the polls. Still, his wariness of the press is evident. In turning down my request for a sit-down interview, Bush's communications director, Katie Muniz, said, "The governor doesn't do national media," pointing up the fact that there are few governors in office today who wouldn't die for a little. (Instead Muniz sent an e-mail message lavishing praise on his environmental and education initiatives. "He has led in addressing old problems in new ways," she enthused. "Ask state leaders around the country. Governor Bush's reforms are serving as models for the nation.")
In his comfy cone of silence, then, he'd prefer to let his record do the talking. At events around the state, he is quick to trumpet his achievements: a decreasing crime rate, in addition to the education and environmental programs. His One Florida initiative has ended affirmative action at Florida's public universities to much outcry. On the same page of The Miami Herald on which the "sex plane" article appeared last summer there was an article quoting an estimate that black first-year enrollment at the University of Florida has decreased by nearly half this year, from almost 12 percent of the class in 2000 to about 7 percent in 2001 -- disappointing," according to the university's provost, David Colburn. 
"The governor's policies are punitive as they relate to minorities," says State Senator Kendrick Meek, a Democrat from Miami. "At election time, he's going to run three commercials to every one of the Democrats', doing his Jerry Maguire 'I love black people.' But there's not a barbershop or beauty parlor in the black community where people like this governor." 
Where he may not have the black vote, there is no question about the Cuban vote. Will it be the difference against Reno or whoever emerges as Bush's Democratic challenger? And, after his brother, is he the future president of the United States? 
Seated in the dining room at the mansion now, with its Everglades motif on the wall, Bush is right where he seems to want to be. He switches easily between speaking English and Spanish (his is the first Hispanic family to live in the Governor's Mansion), catching up on the progress of this or that bill, joking with those at his table, then leaning back to take in someone else's punch line. Before the meal is served, before Bush passes off his piece of chocolate cake on an eager if well-fed state representative to his right, Lieutenant Governor Brogan stands up and welcomes everyone, then turns the floor over to the governor. Like the state he leads, Jeb Bush is partly the creation of news and rumor, misperception and exaggeration, and it is in moments like these that flickers of the real man show through.
Bush remains seated, reminds everyone that this is just a casual chance to catch up, so there'll be no formalities. Then he does something rare in politics. He shows emotion, unrehearsed emotion. Without a trace of irony in his voice, he says: "Welcome to your house. I love you." As if by setting the words on a warm Gulf breeze, they might go forth and pollinate Florida itself, this riven congregation, this new day rising.
Driving the state of Florida from north to south, one is barraged by a cacophony of images: a huge Confederate flag luffing high above the intersection of I-10 and I-75, anti-abortion billboards starring fetuses, other billboards for W.W.F. wrestling goons and, farther along, approaching Tampa, billboards advertising strip clubs and the tourist attractions of Old Florida: the mermaids of Weeki Watchee and the manatees of Homosassa Springs. Out here, too, in the murk around Ocala, is the skunk ape, Florida's own Bigfoot, eight feet of orange-haired, sulfur-smelling beast that roams the swampland like a bad nightmare.
What is unavoidable as you drive along the west coast of the state to Tampa, what you surrender to and grow accustomed to finally as the best beaches begin, are the condos, miles upon miles of them, in pink stucco and white cement, standing sentinel over spotless beaches, dappled with bright yellow sun umbrellas, and then, as far as the eye can gaze, the green Gulf waters of bonefish and tarpon. And where condos don't exist yet, it seems they're in the process of being built, a wall of plywood all the way to Miami.
If there is guilt to assess for this odd Xanadu, complete with its extravagances and attendant environmental degradation (satellite photographs of the Everglades show the ravaging effects of development here), then we all stand accused. Florida exists by the good graces of our patronage -- by those of us who live in the other 49. That is, it's a pure creation of our demand, of our retirees and relocated, cold-weary brethren, as well as of our families on vacation. And so we are equally the authors of Florida; it belongs to us as much as it belongs to itself.
How is this? Take, first of all, the fact that the state has no income tax, but is rather financed in large part by the $16.6 billion in sales tax it collected last fiscal year. Tourism infuses Florida's economy with $50 billion a year. To reduce it to its simplest formulation: if those Mickey Mouse ears aren't selling in Orlando, there's less chalk in the classrooms of Gainesville. And since Sept. 11, Florida hasn't had a run on mouse ears. As a result, the state is looking at a shortfall in the neighborhood of $300 million to $1 billion in its $50 billion budget for the coming year, depending on which party you believe. Belt-tightening is rampant. At a number of Florida's public universities, teachers have been prohibited from using copy machines since fall. And Florida now ranks 41st in per-pupil state financing for kindergarten through 12th grade. If it weren't for sustained low-interest rates that have buoyed the real-estate market (housing starts rose here by 2.2 percent in 2001), we might be talking about a Florida bust in the same dire way we were talking about the California energy disaster.
What contributes to this symbiotic relationship between Florida and the rest of America is a telling demographic dynamic. The north of Florida, sometimes derisively referred to by those in the lower climes of the state as the Redneck Riviera, resembles the Deep South, populated as it is by Southerners more kindred in their conservative ethos to the citizens of Alabama and Mississippi than to those of Miami. The middle of the state, which includes Orlando, Tampa and St. Petersburg (a city once known as God's Waiting Room for its preponderance of retirees) teems with transplanted Midwesterners. And then the south, and Miami in particular, is referred to, with a slightly patronizing nod by its northerly brethren, as the Sixth Borough -- as in the sixth borough of New York City -- a Democratic bastion, if one subtracts the roughly 700,000 Cubans who live in Dade County. 
Furthermore, the state offers a close reflection of the nation's ethnic breakdown. Where 75 percent of Americans today are white, in Florida 78 percent are white. Where nearly 13 percent are Hispanic, in Florida 17 percent are. And where 12 percent are black, in Florida more than 14 percent are. (The United States census numbers here include persons reporting themselves as multiple races.) That Florida's minority groups are represented in slightly higher numbers than the national average already augurs a trend identified by population experts, one that calls for the sustained growth of the country's minority population in the coming decades, especially among Hispanics -- offering yet more proof that the future has already arrived in Florida.
I was thinking about Florida, the great Gulf Stream shape-shifter, as I drove south through orange trees and swamp, and I began to wonder if all those television commentators were right after all, if Florida really was somehow cursed. I thought about the mysterious skunk ape and Ted Bundy and witch doctors throwing spells in Miami's Little Haiti. I thought about Dale Earnhardt, the great Nascar champion from North Carolina who drove his last race in Daytona, dying on the last lap; and the Missouri-born Payne Stewart, the golfer whose bizarre last flight originated from Orlando. Then there was perhaps the state's greatest hero, the Seminole leader Osceola, who was actually born in Georgia, the son of a British trader, and who fearlessly fought the Army in the Everglades and was duped by Gen. Thomas Jesup at St. Augustine in 1837, which led to his death in a South Carolina prison. And finally, before all of them came the Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Leon, the first Floridian developer who tried to seek his fortune at the Fountain of Youth (rumored to sit atop a pile of silver and gold), instead took a poison arrow near Charlotte Harbor and later died in Cuba. Florida has always been a stage on which its visitors have preened and strutted, often briefly and unsuccessfully, perhaps at times hubristically, which may explain our feelings about the state as being somehow alien or even an altogether Otherworld. But cursed? 
Based on my conversations with a cross-section of Floridians -- including ministers and politicians, beat reporters and retirees, who as a group exhibited an equal eagerness to psychoanalyze their increasingly notorious home (most of them, as transplants, are still trying to figure it out as well) -- the state seems more cursed by a willingness to tear down and rebuild (in the name of the Almighty dollar) and a short-term memory that might rival that of a patient in an Oliver Sacks case study. Considering that Florida has packed nearly 25 percent more people onto its balmy peninsula in the last decade, bringing the current total of its residents to nearly 16 million, one can at least isolate a cause for Florida's increasing disorientation. If it's a state that hasn't really learned from its mistakes -- as any Carl Hiaasen novel will tell you -- that perhaps is because it doesn't really remember them in the first place. "The beauty of Florida is that we are a land of innocents," the poet McGrath says. "No one is to blame for anything. It's a pyramid scheme of ineptitude and sloth."
Hiaasen says: "We've always been a doormat for dirtbags -- and not just terrorists and criminals, but crooked doctors, lawyers, accountants and insider traders who all move to Boca Raton and build big houses because bankruptcy laws protect them here. They've all come with the herd. It's the end of the road, a transient place, like California, and the bar of weirdness is so high it would be almost impossible to be noticed unless you did something incredibly stupid or egregious."
And one other note from the road: as you move south through Florida, especially if you've abandoned a northern clime where people live under layers and layers of wool for half the year, you find bodies wearing less and less clothing. This is more important than it sounds, for it is not just a sartorial observation but a metaphor too, for a certain transparency, a lack of suspicion, perhaps a naivete, a general, open, Floridian disposition dictated in part by weather -- by benevolent days of wall-to-wall sunshine, a perpetual summer punctuated by the autumn roll of hurricanes. That disposition is reflected in a people who tend to be more trusting -- or, rather, simply more uninterested, for many Floridians learned long ago not to ask too many questions of their neighbors -- and it is reflected, too, in the state's political process.
"I think the national and foreign media were amazed when they came down here to cover the 2000 election," says Barbara Petersen, president of the First Amendment Foundation, a nonprofit watchdog group in the state. "To have this open televised recount, then to have this open televised debate about the recount, whatever the outcome. Afterward, Jeb, who prides himself as the e-governor, had to turn over thousands of e-mails. What sets Florida apart is its constitutional guarantee of access to all three branches of state government."
And if the nation was horrified to learn that the two hijackers who drove planes into Tower 1 and Tower 2 of the World Trade Center received their flight training in the state, it surprised Floridians a little less. 
In fact, a quick breakdown of the recent big news stories is not only a primer in global geography but also a case study in state schizophrenia. Rudi Dekkers, the man who ran the flight school at which Mohamed Atta and a Saudi friend trained, was Dutch. Versace was an Italian killed by a half-Filipino who hailed from San Diego. Elian was a Cuban affair, pitting first-generation Cuban-Americans against their own family back in Cuba. Even the election, if you are to believe certain urgent voices in the state, was decided by the blacks (for Gore) or the Cuban-Americans (for Bush), while the recount jetted in out-of-state visitors from the white power structure like James Baker and David Boies. For better or worse, Florida may be the truest melting pot we have -- and oddly, perhaps because memory is indeed so short here, it has more or less worked.
"I didn't know who they were," protests Dekkers today about the terrorists who trained under his guidance. And then sounding the perfect Floridian note, the Sunshine mantra, he adds, "But then, why should I have?"
Behind the windshield of her eyeglasses, wearing a sensible green dress, Janet Reno grips the wheel with big hands, her long body folded a bit uncomfortably in the front seat of a poky rental car, driving back to campaign headquarters after yet another plate of cold chicken, wild rice and the umpteenth speech of the last year, this time at a Broward County Chamber of Commerce luncheon. The speech was full of Reno touchstones -- memories of her hard-drinking, maverick mother, the unspoiled Florida of yore and an urgent if vague call to arms for a new, improved Florida -- but the biggest response came when a banner hanging on the wall behind her came undone and clattered loudly to the ground as if by voodoo. Reno turned slowly, turned back to the crowd and with perfect comic timing said, "Must be Jeb Bush!"
After eight years of being chauffeured in bulletproof vehicles as attorney general, Reno has been driving a lot lately -- and is about to head out on a 15-day road trip that will take her from Pensacola to Miami, this time in her red 1999 Ford Ranger; Reno's handlers have thus dubbed it the Red Truck Tour. It's a journey that will end in mid-March to mixed reviews: some will call it an anemic, cheesy attempt to highlight Reno's supposed folksiness; others will point to the 2,796 miles traveled as evidence of Reno's fitness for office. At the very least, it will serve up an image to counter the one of an old woman, momentarily out cold and sprawled on her back beneath the hot lights in January, her Wicked Witch of the West pumps poking out from the rostrum: in this case, a candidate moving forward, in the upright position, perhaps minus sizzle but nonetheless with the kind of dogged determination and physical stamina that others have underestimated in her before now.
If the odds-on favorite, Jeb Bush, is a wash-ashore from Texas bearing a marquee name and a lucrative past in the state's time-honored real-estate trade, Janet Reno is one of those wild macaws, born in Miami and bred at the edge of the Everglades in a cypress house, who has spent most of her life in public service of one kind or another, and as the first female state attorney in Florida presided over the most dangerous years of drug trade, fabulated by the 80's television show "Miami Vice."
And while it has been said that Jeb is New Florida and Janet is Old Florida, it's not clear what this means exactly besides their 14-year age difference and a sense that, by being born on local turf, Reno has never exactly had to reinvent herself, has always stubbornly been just Janet -- a bit gawky, competitive and in love with the Brooklyn Dodgers and the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge. (It was actually her grandfather who reinvented his family, coming from Denmark via Wisconsin to Miami, changing his name from Rasmussen to Reno, allegedly by picking the name off a map.) She grew up during the post-World War II years when the state was still a sparsely populated American frontier. If she saw her family as homesteaders, carving out a life at the edge of the Everglades -- hand-building their house, riding horseback and working the land -- millions and millions have since arrived to a readymade land of condos and Art Deco hotels, bungalows and strip malls, with the idea that Florida is a virtual and psychic frontier.
For their differences, the candidates may be more similar than they'd like to believe. Both cast themselves as can-do achievers of unimpeachable integrity and say they want to protect the environment, one of the state's biggest issues. Both claim education as a top priority. From opposite sides, both are slowly creeping closer to the center to claim precious swing voters. And both are said to be stubborn and exacting, at times imperious and zealous. If Jeb Bush struggles against the news media to be taken on his own terms without the hype, private-life intrusions and "brother of" introductions, he might try being Janet Reno for a day. 
It's hard to imagine a brushstroke that hasn't already been slapped on the former attorney general -- or won't soon be. Her physical appearance and perceived androgyny, her inextricable link to Clinton, the plodding nature of her Justice press conferences -- all of these have been grist for barbs and criticism, sometimes in the nastiest of terms. And that's not even taking into account the right-wing extremists who read her resume as a rap sheet of government conspiracy: Waco, Oklahoma City, Elian. Somehow Reno, or the distortion of her, has become part of our cultural vernacular. She is the Other, the unfeeling automaton, kin to the mysterious skunk ape, materialized from the swamp. And yet she remains mostly impervious. "I don't really give a damn what people think of me," she says.
In person, Reno is nothing like that stiff, press-conference Reno. Her paradoxes abound. She's a loner who clearly needs and enjoys people; an outsider who's an insider with a mean Rolodex; a husbandless lover of family whose best friend is her younger sister, Maggy; a seemingly austere woman who is prone to laugh (and when she does, it's like a little outburst). She is a person both awkward and uninhibited (her awkwardness more assumed by others than evidenced by her) -- and someone who inspires deep loyalty in those closest to her. And she can be downright wacky, as when she appeared on "Saturday Night Live" just after leaving office in Washington, dancing like a stilted punk rocker.
"Once people get to know me, they often say, 'But you're such a gentle girl,"' she says one day at lunch at a Mediterranean restaurant near her home in Kendall. She has a plate of grilled lamb kebab and rice, some hummus and a glass of chardonnay. From time to time, her hand shakes from the Parkinson's disease that was diagnosed in October 1995, but she pays it -- and some errant rice on the table -- no mind. "Just like that," she says, with that delighted burst of laughter. "They always say 'girl,' as if I still am one."
To look at her family is to understand the clay from which Janet Reno springs. Her 62-year-old brother, Bob, is a longtime political columnist for Newsday. Her sister Maggy, 61, once served as a county commissioner and is an obsessive outdoorswoman, kayaking the rivers of the world. And her polymathic brother Mark, 60, is a former paratrooper who lives in a thatched hut behind Reno's house and splits his time between professionally trapping rodents and working as a court bailiff. It's not quite the Bushes of Kennebunkport, but a down-home Kendall dynasty of its own. Collectively, the Renos seem to know something about everything -- and they are consummate storytellers. When Janet is with her sister, as on the night I join them for dinner at Maggy's wooden bungalow in Stuart, two hours north of Miami, the two sisters spend hours in animated chatter. "We do this all the time," Reno says. "We tell each other the best things from our day."
Later she turns to her sister and says, "You won't believe who I saw the other day." 
"Who?" asks Maggy with her usual excitement.
"Katherine Harris," says Reno, smiling. 
"No . . . where?"
Harris, Florida's secretary of state and Congressional hopeful, became the face of the 2000 election when she ruled that the Florida vote would stand without a recount, a decision upheld by the United States Supreme Court. "I saw her in the airport," Reno says. "She came up to me and said, 'We have mutual acquaintances who think the world of you, and I just wanted to say hello."'
"Really? What'd you do, Janny?"
"Why, I said hello. But it was just so . . . so . . . strange. She's much shorter than I thought. Did you know that about her?"
Inevitably, dinner conversation comes around to their mother, Jane Wood Reno, who died three months before her daughter went to Washington. "Pop the pomp" was one of her mantras, and she spent her life doing just that, in the most colorful manner. Her children remember her wrestling alligators with the Seminole Indians, hitchhiking home on 18-wheelers after nights at the bar and her intense love for all things Florida. In fact, Reno and her mother once circumnavigated the state by motorboat. Of all things, she taught her children to speak their minds, something Reno has occasionally done with consequences. 
Still. She does not hide her frustration or disdain at the way the 2000 presidential election was handled in the state, claiming it reflected poorly on all Floridians. Though she says she will not run a campaign of personal attacks in hopes of restoring some dignity to the political process, she describes Jeb Bush as "more intelligent than his brother, but arrogant." 
About her former boss, who still seems to lurk behind her on the campaign trail, she admits she still has fondness for Bill Clinton, an admission for which she's occasionally criticized. 
Reno brushes aside claims by the former senator Bob Kerrey that, at a dinner party last year, Clinton listed her among his five least favorite people on his White House team (a story Clinton's office later denied in a phone call to Reno). Responding to an ill-kept secret that, at one point, Clinton had wanted a new attorney general, she says bluntly: "I think he would have liked me gone after those first four years, but then I didn't box him in. When I announced that I had Parkinson's" -- in November 1995 -- I just said I'd stay as long as the president wanted, and I told him. And he said he appreciated that."
About the former first lady, Reno is decidedly less charitable. "I was so impressed by her," she says, describing Hillary Clinton in action. And yet as Clinton was driven deeper into the traditional role of first lady -- after the setback of her health-care initiative, her father's death, then Vince Foster's suicide -- Reno says she feels Hillary Clinton eventually came to blame her for granting Kenneth Starr expanded powers that led from the special prosecutor's investigation of a 20-year-old real-estate deal to the most lurid details of the president's sex life. "She was brittle," Reno says. "And I've heard I'm not one of her favorite people because of the way I handled the Lewinsky affair." (Rumors that Hillary Clinton might try to undermine Reno's run for governor have also been categorically denied by the Clintons.)
Even in her fifth and what must be considered final act of a long political career, it seems Reno can't escape the aura of conspiracy. In a way, it's only fitting. One night at her house, she was out back with her brother at his thatched hut, the two of them having cooked fish over an open fire. Reno's hair was wet, matted to her head, her green dress was soaked and, when I inquired about what had happened, she told a story of walking in a state where no one walks, to the fish store just down the road. The clouds, which had gathered in paranoid piles, let loose in one of Florida's famous monsoons, flooding the streets and drenching her. Sitting there now with tousled hair, she couldn't have been happier for having been caught in the downpour. And I tried to imagine her moving in her own time, stopping traffic by the oddity of her presence at the side of the road with a bag of fish clutched in her hand -- Florida's most infamous daughter, its would-be governor and, for a fleeting moment, its only spectacle.
Alack, Florida -- I drove its highways and byways, stuck behind S.M.O.P.'s. (the local idiomatic acronym for "slow-moving old people") and out-Andrettied by pierced-and-pumped youth. At the statehouse in Tallahassee, I heard tell of more tabloid dramas. This time it was Representative J.D. Alexander, cousin of Katherine Harris, describing what it was like to tiptoe around your cousin's house, the cousin with whom you usually stay while the Legislature is in session, as you were now suing each other over your grandfather's $500 million estate. At Homosassa Springs, I communed in an underwater tank with your vegetarian manatees, possibly the galaxy's most innocent creatures, who are being gouged to extinction by the propellers of your pleasure craft and speedboats. 
In Miami Beach -- where all the men and women seemed as if they're front-runners in the casting call for "Temptation Island 3" -- I went to the Versace mansion to stand on the very spot where Versace was murdered. This was not consciously macabre, but rather a function of my blindly following the shutterbug masses -- and here we found his massive Pleasuredome, this epic, Floridian palazzo and ode to material consumption, covered in plastic tarps, being deloused. 
In Hollywood, I visited Shuckums, the bar where locals once brimmed with fury at the fact that Mohamed Atta and his companions rudely drank here, and where scribbled on the men's-room door was the righteous reminder "Terrorists not welcome." Now on this Friday night at the horseshoe counter, with raw oysters shuddering in their shells, inebriated men were trying to pick up less-inebriated women, and with the cavalcade of news cameras now safely established on a beachhead far away, no one remembered anything and eyed one another with the gaze of cuddly possibility. 
If Florida is America's future, it's going to be, Hiaasen says, "almost Toffleresque in its chaos," a place where dots do not connect and each new incident in its history is taken in isolation, as a television drama unto itself, to replace the forgotten one before it.
"It's at the point where we know we can't go six months without another big story down here," he says. "If you're a Floridian, there's a certain sort of rueful but good-natured pride in the state's notoriety. It's a camaraderie born of being part of the freak show. You gotta laugh, because what the hell else are you going to do?"
Finally, in the Little Havana section of Miami, I pulled up in front of Elian's house. His great-uncles, Lazaro (father of Elian's made-for-TV aunt, Marisleysis) and Delfin Gonzalez (who was shirtless and wore a watch with Elian's face on it), were both puttering around, tidying the grounds, as Lazaro's family had vacated the two-bedroom bungalow shortly after Elian was taken by I.N.S. agents in order that it might become a living museum. Among other miracles -- and these included the visitations of the singer Gloria Estefan and the actor Andy Garcia -- the Virgin Mary was alleged to have appeared in the bathroom mirror. But what had she come to say?
It was the end of the day, and the light was that big, orange-orange, four-dimensional light of Florida, belonging only to Florida, bathing everything in the felicity of good feeling, intensifying the color of each bungalow on the street, as well as the verdant greens of the palm trees that seemed to bleed more color in a warm breeze. The boy, the cameras and the crowds were long gone. All that remained was this empty house full of Elian's toys and Elian's race-car bed and newspaper clippings and paintings marking yet another surreal chapter in the Florida story. Pictures of Elian with the magician David Copperfield seemed to be everywhere. The beaten-up door to the back bedroom had been left just as it was, after it had been battered open by government agents bearing automatic weapons, and the famous closet in which Elian was hiding with Donato Dalrymple, the man who first fished him from the sea, was hung with the exact clothes from the predawn hours of that April morning two years ago.
"We pay taxes," Lazaro Gonzalez said wearily. "We love this country, but we hate the people who did this to us." Beneath the American and Cuban flags, as well as a heavy wooden crucifix that hung from the gutters, a couple of friends joined us on the front lawn, and the discussion careered from how Fidel Castro, Bill Clinton and Janet Reno had plotted together to steal Elian from them to how the Cuban community delivered the presidential election to George W. Bush. 
What struck me was just how convinced they were in their beliefs, how zealously American they were, standing on the front lawn of this relatively new landscape. If the country appeared on those election-night maps as a place divided by red and blue principalities, in Florida the various special-interest groups -- blacks, Cubans, other Hispanics, the elderly, the Jews and the hook-and-bullet N.R.A.'ers -- neutralized one another, blending the state purple. More likely than not, George W. Bush won because, of the ballots counted, he'd simply received 537 more than Al Gore. Those votes might have belonged to the Lhasa apso owners of the state, who knows? -- and it's possible that those Lhasa apso owners may decide the next election, for nothing, nothing at all, is certain here. 
One of the men on the lawn was short, burly and loquacious, with a cellphone holstered to his waist. He told the story of how his father, a political dissident, had been killed trying to escape from Cuba on a raft. "Fidel Castro shot him" is how he phrased it. He explained how he and his mother nearly didn't make the 90 miles from Havana to Miami, how his mother had been tricked and disgraced and then persevered, until later they were permitted to leave. He'd been a boy at his mother's side through it all, just like Elian. "I'm going to tell you something, brother," he said, thumping my chest. "We're living in the Promised Land, don't you forget it."
He went on. "That boy went back to prison -- Elian's living in Fidel Castro's prison. His future was right here in this house. Man, you've seen all the toys in there. One minute he was here, and then he was taken away. I think about it every day. My father was shot on a raft trying to get here, and here I am, breathing the air, free."
He stopped, and a strange lambency filled the yard, and, lo, by some odd trick of light, he seemed to have tears in his eyes. The American flag was over his head, faded and torn, and he was standing on the good earth of Florida. He was standing in Elian's front yard, waiting for the next hurricane. Yes, now that I think about it, we were waiting together for the next hurricane, and that man, it may have been a trick of light, but he had tears in his eyes, and whether they were for joy or sadness, I can't say.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 12, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article on April 21 about Florida's place in the national culture referred incorrectly to the standoff between Branch Davidians and the F.B.I. in Waco, Tex., which occurred during the tenure of Janet Reno as attorney general of the United States and is getting new attention in light of her campaign for the Florida governorship. The investigation of the standoff led by former Senator John Danforth was independent, not Congressional. According to the Danforth report, the Branch Davidians were responsible for the fire inside their compound; it was not started by the F.B.I. The number of Branch Davidians who died was about 80, not 75, including more than 20 children, not 25. The previous office held by Reno was state attorney for Dade County, Fla., not state attorney general.
The article also misidentified the first family of Hispanic origin to live in the Florida governor's mansion. It was that of Bob Martinez, not Jeb Bush. The article also referred incorrectly to a swamp in Florida. It is Okefenokee; Atchafalaya (not Atchalafaya) is in Louisiana.

HEADLINE: ART/ARCHITECTURE; 
Russian Photographers Who Fell Out of History

BYLINE:  By VICKI GOLDBERG 

DATELINE: HOUSTON 

 BODY:
GLOBALIZATION may be a new economic phenomenon, but networks of international influence have been around a long time. In art, the first International Style began around 1400 in Western Europe, when the world was not yet a globe. The second International Style did not come along until the 1920's, but that's just a matter of labels. Once the railroad, the steamship and the modern press expanded travel and communication, it would be hard to think of a major artistic style that did not travel everywhere.
 But styles do change as they move about the globe, and sometimes their subjects and meanings change, too. "Russian Pictorialism," a show last month at Fotofest, the biennial Houston photography festival, made clear that this late-19th- and early-20th-century photographic style had certain goals and achievements quite unlike those of Pictorialism in other countries. There are certainly enough similarities to identify the work with the International Pictorialist style, which was characterized by its determined effort to look like any art other than photography, but the differences are so basic that they raise questions about the usefulness of general definitions. 
 With more than 130 pictures by 16 photographers from the 1880's to the 1930's, this was the largest show of Russian Pictorialism seen abroad since a 1928 exhibition in Italy, and it was the first time most Americans had the chance to see any of it. Still, that puts us way ahead of most Russians, for Pictorialism was outlawed by the Soviets in the mid-1930's and was effectively invisible until it began to emerge from obscurity in the 1990's.
After the death of the Pictorialist Aleksandr Grinberg in 1979, a friend stopped by his communal apartment in Moscow and found a neighbor using an exhibition print as a dustpan. Yet Grinberg had exhibited in more than 50 shows in Europe, Asia and the United States and won many gold medals in the 1920's before being silenced. (Honk if you've ever heard of him.) He was only one among many to show successfully around the world.
The exhibition's curators, Yevgeny Berezner and Irina Chmyreva from the State Center for Museums and Exhibitions of the Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation, say in a brief but illuminating essay in the Fotofest catalog that the history of Russian Pictorialism has yet to be written. And right now, it's not just history but news.
The Russian Pictorialists clearly shared their international contemporaries' fervent desire to make photography an art as well as their predilection for Impressionism and Symbolism. Like other Pictorialists, they favored landscapes, portraits and nudes, mastered such "artistic" techniques as bromoil and gum bichromate, made photographs that could be mistaken for the products of other graphic techniques and courted blur, color and texture. Nikolai Andreyev's landscapes emerge from the romantic hours of dawn and twilight or the moments before a storm; Grinberg's are suffused with calm. Vasily Ulitin, in 1929, turned a factory into a mood poem composed of dark silhouettes, plumes of smoke and a pale glimmer of moon. Portraits are equally romantic: Nikolai Svishchyov-Paola titled one "Demon, the Portrait of a Young Man," and Miron Sherling's images of the opera singer Fyodor Chaliapin in costume are over the top even for opera.
Occasionally these artists committed remarkable excesses that took the style beyond the decorous territory it occupied elsewhere. In 1903, Aleksei Mazurin put a sepia photograph of a nun into the trapezoidal opening of a Spanish frame ornately carved like an arch with fake, painted tiles, creating an elaborate religious icon. Andreyev liked to paint and draw with crayons on his bromide-print landscapes, inserting a startling, faintly orange moon in one, infusing another so thoroughly with muted color that it became a miniature painting.
Even more striking is the loving attention paid to peasants, who symbolized the ideal harmony of humanity, nature and God. Pictorialism in other countries largely ignored workers and farmers. It was an art-for-art's-sake movement, an attempt to elevate photography and prove there was more to it than what the man in the street could produce with a Kodak. Pictorialism has also been said to represent a reaction against the cold materialism of science and applied technology and an attempt, as in Symbolism, to plumb the imagination. It was nostalgic and essentially elitist. In Europe, its placid vision momentarily reassured a bourgeoisie threatened by the unrest of the lower classes; in America, Alfred Stieglitz, who loudly championed Pictorialism, totally ignored Jacob Riis's pictures of tenement dwellers and Lewis Hine's of child labor.
In Russia, however, Ms. Chmyreva and Mr. Bereznov write, from the early 19th century on artists considered it their duty to deal with pervasive ethical problems and to improve public morality. The situation of the peasants was a primary concern. Though the serfs were freed in 1861, they gained little, as their land could barely support them and they remained illiterate. Photographers like Sergei Lobovikov, who tenderly photographed barefoot mothers and peasants in the field, created bucolic scenes and idealized Russian types while also performing what they saw as a civic duty. Presumably, such pictures could help soothe the guilt of a liberal audience, who, the curators say, saw the Pictorialist style itself as a mode of ethical, even spiritual, self-improvement -- an unlikely attitude in the West.
Russian photographers had one enormous advantage over their counterparts in the West: at the end of the 19th century, the Russian Academy of Fine Arts officially recognized photography, putting it on a par with other arts, while elsewhere it had to continue its strenuous social climbing. What's more, the progressive intelligentsia regarded photography as a sure sign of cultural modernity, and they valued photographs of landscape as evidence of the inherent spirituality of nature. For progressives, owning photographs was a vital element of self-definition. And photography was widely seen across the country in magazines and traveling exhibitions in the early 20th century. In America, by contrast, Camera Work, Stieglitz's splendid magazine, had just under 1,000 subscribers at its peak. 
The curators say that Pictorialist photography was so pervasive in Russia that it influenced the appearance of characters in novels as well as the appearances of actual people. Ms. Chmyreva and Mr. Berezner even suggest that Pictorialism served for a time as a kind of "metalanguage" that could speak to and unite the different classes, generations and geographic regions of Russia. After the Revolution, the Soviets endorsed both the avant-garde photography of people like Aleksandr Rodchenko and Gustav Klutsis and the derriere-garde work of the Pictorialists, whose photographs represented the Soviet Union in most foreign exhibitions in the 1920's.
By the late 1920's, both photographic styles were subject to criticism; they would soon be suffocated by Socialist Realism. In 1935, Grinberg, who had earlier been accused of "deviation from Soviet ideology" and criticized as a "filthy survival of the capitalist generation," dared to exhibit 20 nudes. Excoriated for "catering to the taste of pre-Revolutionary provincial hairdressers," he was arrested on charges of pornography and condemned to five years of labor. (A book on Grinberg, with many useful though rather poorly reproduced illustrations, was published by Carre Noir in 1996.)
The core of the collection shown at Fotofest was assembled by Mikhail Golosovsky, a photographer and optical engineer who patiently ferreted out work wherever it lay hiding. The show enlarged the history of Pictorialism, not only by adding photographers and images, but also by pointing out how ethical and spiritual meanings could inhere in photographs that would have been considered secular elsewhere. Negotiations are under way to mount this show in Russia, taking the exiled work home again.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/New Jersey; 
A Site Near the Mall Is Now a Plus for Offices

BYLINE:  By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

DATELINE: ROCKAWAY, N.J. 

 BODY:
IT is a most unprepossessing building that has been singled out for star treatment here in the shadow of Town Square Mall and the new Hilton Gardens Hotel. But that last part is the point, developers say: it is next to the mall and hotel.
 Previously occupied by the ITT Hartford Insurance Companies and vacant for five years, 333 Mount Hope Avenue off Route 80 in Morris County is loaded with potential, according to its current owners, WP Commercial. They have stripped the boxy 95,000-square-foot structure down to bare bones and are giving it a multimillion-dollar, full-body makeover -- from facade to mechanical systems. 
 Within 90 days or so, it will re-emerge as Rockaway Executive Center, a spiffed-up office space with surefire allure, according to WP Commercial, because of proximity to "suburban amenities." 
"It will be a Class A office site next to a large regional mall providing a wonderful amenity base for employees," said WP Commercial's chief operating officer, Mark Schaevitz. "After working a long day or on lunch hours, office workers can shop, go to the dry cleaner, the bank, the supermarket, or pick up a video.
"Business clients can stay at the Hilton Gardens, which is directly contiguous to the building, which is located next to a four-highway interchange.
"What's not to like?" asked Mr. Schaevitz about the 20-year-old building, acquired last year for $5.2 million. Mr. Schaevitz said his company had found a niche in refurbishing buildings that might otherwise have faded into the commercial-office-market woodwork, but which are close to shops, hotels, and major traffic arteries. 
Even in the current office market, where vacancy rates have risen for six straight quarters, WP Commercial -- a company that was acquired by Goldman Sachs in the late 1990's -- -- feels bullish about the makeover tactic, Mr. Schaevitz said.
"The development strategy works in both ascending and descending markets," he asserted, "because it always offers value to tenants, both in terms of employee retention -- always a big issue in New Jersey -- and amenities for clients, those with whom a tenant does business."
Steven M. Frank, the CB Richard Ellis broker who is marketing the Rockaway property, said the trend to consolidation and downsizing among state businesses enhances the value of an amenity-rich site.
"Employee attraction and retention are important factors to look at -- what I call the frictional costs -- resulting from property turnover," Mr. Frank said.
"A few years ago, all you had to do was provide an attractive options package to get and keep employees," Mr. Frank observed. "The stock went up, and everybody was happy.
"Today, the options are uncertain, and today what's on the minds of many employees is quality of life. The rise of the two-income family has made access to a place to do errands and chores during long workdays a major plus that companies can offer."
For most of the service industries that now dominate New Jersey's economy, employee compensation is already the top expense, Mr. Frank noted. He said providing employees with a good commute to an office near amenities is a way to add no-cost benefits that can be more valuable than a raise.
So, why isn't everyone doing this? Because it's not possible, Mr. Frank said.
"We think of New Jersey as being filled with malls, but the major ones aren't really that numerous, he said. "So the sites -- and opportunities to develop around them -- are relatively rare, and they're sought after."
THERE are several current examples of developers taking this approach -- a project going on next to Willowbrook Mall in Wayne, for one. At that site, Mack-Cali is at work on the 178,000-square-foot space that formerly served as headquarters for the now-bankrupt Grand Union stores.
"We're modernizing," said Michael Grossman, a vice president at Mack-Cali. "We are redoing the common areas, constructing a new lobby and repositioning the building to attract quality tenants." 
The Grand Union building's style had been "basic institutional" with a side entrance and no real lobby area, Mr. Grossman said. The renovated building will have a glass-and-aluminum lobby finished with wood panels and limestone floor tiles, and it is to be cosmetically upgraded throughout.
"We have 90,000 square feet on the market," Mr. Grossman said, "and the Willowbrook location is a great selling point, we think. It's a proven fact that once tenants move into a property that has the luxury of nearby amenities, they tend not to want to leave, because employees are happier."
In Bridgewater, there is the example of commercial space being constructed with proximity to amenities in mind.
Hines has almost finished building a 600,000-square-foot office complex called Bridgewater Crossing, adjacent to the Bridgewater Commons Mall and also a 350-room Marriott Hotel.
"Siting next to amenities -- that's what this project is all about," said Hines's project manager, Michael Pride. "The Hines U.S. Development Fund, which built this project, built 10 others around the country at what are referred to as suburban core locations. That was a prerequisite for buying this site and all the others.
"Hines considered the Bridgewater site very, very attractive because it is becoming so difficult to find an office site in New Jersey next to retail and a hotel."
Mr. Pride said his company believed the mindset of large commercial tenants had completely shifted from the 1980's, when the trend was to set up headquarters at secluded campuses. 
"Then, the idea was to be out in the woods, literally," he said. "Now, companies want to provide employees with a little stimulation and sense of community: pedestrian access to retail and a hotel, a place to go when they walk outside building."
Bridgewater Commons was built 20 years ago to create a downtown for Bridgewater, which, like the corporate town of Parsippany, 10 miles east, had no retail center. Now, the mall functions as a Main Street, Mr. Pride said, flanked by development.
"This little node is effectively a community," in Mr. Pride's view, "and employees at our buildings become a part of it."
The pharmaceutical company Aventis moved in February to the first of the two Bridgewater Crossing buildings to open. Aventis's facilities manager, Burt Horner, said the office workers were pleased with the move.
FOR the moving-in transition, Hines set up a golf cart ferry service to introduce employees to the mall. Now that spring weather has arrived, employees are out there "getting some exercise," Mr. Pride said. "Nobody has to get into their car. Given the car culture in New Jersey, that's a very special amenity."
The buildings are equipped with a helipad that Aventis uses several times a day to ferry people from Newark International Airport and other transit centers, Mr. Pride said. "When people are in town on business, they can walk too -- maybe go over to the mall after hours and take in a movie."
The second Bridgewater Crossing building is to open soon and is being marketed by Insignia/ESG.
Mr. Frank, the marketing broker in Rockaway, said he likes to use an "everybody wins" approach to selling space. "Let's face it, as often as not when businesses have to move, nobody's happy," he said.
"But this setup can serve the need of a company to reduce its costs and serve the need of the administrative group that oversees the needs of employees. It's certainly a benefit to the large malls, which get more customers.
"In the end, I really do think everybody wins."

HEADLINE: Cables Across the Sound Leave Hartford Divided 

BYLINE:  By CHRISTINE WOODSIDE 

 BODY:
LEGISLATORS from both parties have joined to oppose Gov. John G. Rowland, who last week promised to veto legislation that would stop the installation of utility lines under Long Island Sound for one year. 
 Last week, after promising a veto, the governor issued an executive order to stop pending cable projects for six months. He called for a task force to study cable crossings and report by next January. 
 His order exempts a project to repair a leaky electrical cable between Norwalk and Port Jefferson, N.Y., and does not apply to the installation of an electrical and fiber-optic cable between New Haven Harbor and the former Shoreham nuclear power plant on Long Island. That project received permits from the Connecticut Siting Council earlier this year and could be completed this spring, although the state attorney general is challenging it in court.
The legislators said their version of a moratorium is better. If legislators vote as they did for the moratorium, they will easily override any veto. The Senate approved a one-year moratorium for all the projects, by a vote of 31-2 on April 10, following the House's April 3 approval, 138-11.
"The bill says 'let's slow down, let's take a look at something the Siting Council has not addressed, the cumulative effect of these projects,' " said Senator Donald Williams, a Democrat from Danielson who is co-chairman of the legislature's Environment Committee.
"We can't ignore the economy of Long Island Sound," Senator Williams said. "We've been concerned in recent years with the drastically dropping lobster population and the shellfish beds." 
The New Haven Harbor project, proposed by Trans-Energie U.S. Ltd., an affiliate of a Canadian company, moved its cable to avoid some shellfish beds in New Haven Harbor and reached deals with shellfishermen to compensate them for losses.
"We've spent hundreds of millions of dollars cleaning up Long Island Sound," said Senator William Aniskovich, a Republican from Branford. "Why would we place the investment we've made in jeopardy, just so that a handful of companies try to win a race?" Senator Aniskovich said the third pending cable project, the Islander East natural gas pipeline (for which the Siting Council was holding public hearings last week) would go through his neighborhood before hitting the water to cross the Sound.
"Look, I'm a Republican," Mr. Aniskovich said. "The environmentalists really shied away from Republicans, thinking Republicans would line up behind the president, the governor and the utility crossings. I think that was a miscalculation. The more I learned, the easier this issue was to speak out on. All we're saying is: slow down." 
Environmental groups who met with legislators said their votes to stop the utility projects were atypical. "It was very unusual," said Donald Strait, executive director of the Connecticut Fund for the Environment, based in New Haven. "We feel it's quite historic. It's not in response to one project." 
Leah Lopez, staff lawyer for Save the Sound, a South Norwalk-based environmental group, said: "The whole moratorium was pretty unusual. First of all, they don't usually go for a moratorium; second of all, it was bipartisan, and third, to stop a project that has already been granted approvals was a pretty gutsy move." 
Mr. Strait and other environmental advocates said there were as many as a dozen utility lines planned for the Sound.
"I see no evidence of anything like that kind of number," said S. Derek Phelps, executive director of the Connecticut Siting Council. 
The Long Island Power Authority said it needed more sources of electricity, but that Connecticut should realize that power could flow in the other direction, to Connecticut, if Long Island did not need it. If the New Haven-Shoreham cable is not laid this year, the authority hopes that other plants and connections will get the island through the summer. Ten back-up gas turbines and a repaired connection from Westchester County all should be working by the summer, said Michael Lowndes, a spokesman for LIPA.
"I don't want to mislead you to say that with these other things everything's going to be hunky-dory here on Long Island," Mr. Lowndes said. And he said that even with the Sound cable, conservation is essential. "We still need our customers to change the ways they think about power and to use it more efficiently and effectively," he said.

HEADLINE: LONG ISLAND VINES; 
Small Winery's Red

BYLINE:  By HOWARD G. GOLDBERG 

 BODY:
When Harold Watts, a retired professor of economics at Columbia University, isn't tending his five-acre Wesley Hall Vineyard in Cutchogue, he nurtures his wines in barrel at Ternhaven Cellars.
 And once the daily underpinnings of his boutique business are shipshape, he carries out his duties as president of the Long Island Wine Council, the producers' trade association. 
 Bordeaux -- more precisely, wine with a Bordeaux inflection -- is the low-key Mr. Watts's passion. With a wit as dry as his reds, he announces his homage in his Bordeaux-type blend, called Claret d'Alvah. 
Claret, of course, is a British term for red Bordeaux. Alvah's Lane in Cutchogue is home to Mr. Watts's cabernet sauvignon, cabernet franc and merlot vines.
Not that you would confuse the grandeur of Mr. Watts's chai (the Bordelais word for a chateau's barrel hall) with, say, Chateau Lafite's. His eight-year-old winery is a converted gasoline station at 331 Front Street in Greenport. 
If that is not distinction enough, Ternhaven, the East End's tiniest winery, is also the easternmost on the North Fork. Just think, after you store Claret d'Alvah in your car trunk, you can catch Greenport's evening ferry to France. 
The 600 to 800 cases that Mr. Watts makes yearly don't pit him against big boys like Pindar and Duck Walk. But don't underestimate the quality of his wines.
Ternhaven's '98 Claret d'Alvah ($18) -- smoky, somber, smooth, intensely flavored (berries and black currant), prettily oaked -- can hold its own against Bordeaux blends from better-capitalized local competitors.
Mr. Watts will be pouring his wines, as will 21 other producers, at the council's 12th annual Windows on Long Island tasting in Manhattan, to be held April 29 at Guastavino's restaurant, on the East Side.
Previously, the wine festivity, catered by Long Island and New York City restaurants, was held at Windows on the World, at the World Trade Center, destroyed Sept. 11.
Proceeds will benefit the Windows of Hope Family Relief Fund and the Earth Pledge Foundation, a nonprofit organization that promotes sustainable agriculture. For tickets and information: (212) 725-6611, extension 225, and www.earthpledge.org. HOWARD G. GOLDBERG

HEADLINE: L.I. @ WORK; 
Regionwide Planning Moves Closer to Reality

BYLINE:  By WARREN STRUGATCH 

 BODY:
LAST month, at the scholarship fund-raising breakfast Long Island planners hold annually, something happened that was apparently unprecedented: the county executives of Nassau and Suffolk both showed up, ready to share the limelight.
 Thomas R. Suozzi, Nassau's county executive, was ready to speak off the cuff, as is his fashion. Robert J. Gaffney, his counterpart from Suffolk, came with a prepared text, which is his style. Both were ready to deliver a keynote speech. 
 In the end, both did just that; Mr. Suozzi spoke first.
So rarely have the county executives met, in public or in private, that decisions on important regional issues -- housing, transportation, preservation of natural resources and economic development -- have generally been made on the town and village level, rather than Islandwide. Long Island has developed as a patchwork of regulations and incentives, rules and restrictions that reflect local needs rather than regional concerns. And thus it has never had a unified economic policy.
Because many residents originally came from New York City, so the thinking goes, Long Islanders express a strong preference for low-density housing, mainly separate single-family homes. As a consequence, there are few mixed-use developments that reduce the dependence on the automobile by allowing people to move easily from home, office and shopping. 
"It's difficult to call Long Island a well-planned place when you look at the transportation system here, which really doesn't work," said Sheldon Sackstein, an accountant in Melville and the chairman of Action Long Island, a business and civic organization that recommends solutions to transportation and other problems. "We don't have a single train station to serve the largest business corridor on Long Island, Route 110."
The Long Island Rail Road "shut down the one we had, at Republic Airport, in 1986," he added.
In the absence of a bicounty governing body, the Long Island Regional Planning Board, formed in 1965 by an act of State Legislature, has at least partly filled the vacuum. The 14-member board, a mix of government officials and local leaders, has examined hundreds of issues, ranging from protecting water purity to developing affordable housing, and has issued reports by the shelf-load. A number of its recommendations, including its proposal of an islandwide economic development and job creation plan in the early 90's, have been adapted by the Long Island Association, the region's largest business group.
There are signs that a more integrated and modern approach to planning, at least on the government level, is on the horizon. By dint of their joint appearance before the region's planners last month, the county executives sent a signal that they intend to communicate on regional issues more than their predecessors did.
"A few years ago, I wouldn't have expected either county executive to say much that might challenge the status quo," said Michael Levine, the section director of the local chapter of the American Planning Association and a planner at Allee, King, Rosen & Fleming, an environmental consulting and planning firm in Smithtown. "Things are different these days."
Mr. Levine said he was pleased with the content of the county executives' talks. Mr. Suozzi talked in detail about Nassau's need to clean up contaminated or otherwise neglected spaces, preparing them for new uses. Mr. Gaffney spoke in favor of "smart growth," the voguish concept that seeks to involve local groups more deeply, and earlier, in the planning process. 
"We call this kind of planning 'bottom up,' rather than 'top down,' " said Shellie Williams, the director of development at Sustainable Long Island, a Huntington nonprofit group prominent among local smart-growth advocates. "But there's a roadblock on Long Island to achieving it. There is a shortage of people with vision." 
A number of veteran planners, including Lee E. Koppelman, the executive director of the regional planning board since 1965, welcomed the onset of cooperation between the two heads of county governments.
"If the two county executives are really going to work together, it augurs well not just for good governance but for good planning," Dr. Koppelman said. "It raises the possibility that we will be able to tear down that imaginary Berlin Wall that divides the island at Route 110."
The boundaries of the Island's multitude of towns and villages are equally imaginary, but their effects are real. Depending on the local government in authority, businesses at opposite ends of the same street can face different regulations, taxes and bureaucratic processes. While some businesses view these inconsistencies as an irritation, others turn them to their advantage.
"Often, in Nassau County, we'd be dealing with businesses that knew we were competing with Suffolk County in terms of keeping companies here," said David Salten, who retired last year after 17 years as the chairman of the Nassau County Industrial Development Agency. "We'd even be competing with villages within Nassau County. Sometimes they'd play off one against the other."
Many planners, business leaders and community organizers give the regional planning board credit for the quality of its research and suggestions, and express admiration for Dr. Koppelman as a theorist and environmentalist. In Suffolk County, where he headed the planning department for over two decades, he is widely praised for making conservation and land preservation a priority. But many of his recommendations have failed to sway town and village officials, and ended up being discarded in favor of more parochial responses. 
"Dr. Koppelman has been influential among scholars and regional thinkers but has often not been able to get individual towns and villages to subordinate their views to the big picture," said Mr. Levine, the planner at Allee, King. "Nobody is obligated to listen to the regional planning board. And often, Dr. Koppelman's ideas have been perceived as too ivory tower and not been implemented.
Some planners, including Mr. Levine, believe that as smart-growth policies continue to take root, planners who cannot communicate their ideas effectively will find their influence waning. "As an individual, Dr. Koppelman may be more in the background today, but some of his ideas have caught up," Mr. Levine said. "There's more of an awareness of environmentalism and respect for the importance of thinking about the entire region. Everybody is starting to catch up to where he has always been."
Dr. Koppelman, 74, disagreed mildly with Mr. Levine's assessment. Since retiring as Suffolk's planning director in 1988, he immediately began a second career in academia, as the dean of the Center for Regional Policy Studies, a master's program at the State University at Stony Brook. He continues to direct the regional planning board, and he remains in demand as a consultant. He is currently advising the Towns of Brookhaven and East Hampton as they rewrite their master plans.
"I feel I'm as active as ever, and I have no plans to retire," Dr. Koppelman said. "Maybe in 20 years, I'll decide what I want to do when I grow up."

Westchester County has announced a plan to turn a vacant 60-acre county-owned site in Valhalla into a privately financed biotechnology and medical research park. Under the plan, up to one million square feet of laboratory and incubator space would be built on the property, next to Westchester Medical Center and New York Medical College. 
 The proposed research park is part of Westchester development efforts that include expansion of biotechnology and research. That sector has about 8,000 employees, the county said, giving it the state's largest concentration of biotechnology and pharmaceutical firms, including Regeneron Pharmaceuticals in Tarrytown and Acorda Therapeutics in Hawthorne. 
 Salvatore J. Carrera, the county's director of economic development and real estate, said that more than 30 private developers had expressed interest in the park. The county said that the list included Tishman Construction of New York City, Simone Development of New Rochelle, the Starrett Corporation of New York City and the Louis Dreyfus Property Group in Wilton and Stamford, Conn. 
Three to five finalists will be invited to prepare formal proposals, and a final developer will be selected by late fall, Mr. Carrera said. Those interested can contact the Office of Economic Development at (914) 995-2926.

HEADLINE: The Wait For Breast X-Rays Grows Longer 

BYLINE:  By JOAN SWIRSKY 

 BODY:
SIXTEEN years ago, when Geri Barish, a Baldwin resident, was 41, she scheduled her first mammogram. The radiologist's office gave her an appointment that same week. 
 The routine test -- which is given to many thousands of women on Long Island every year -- detected breast cancer. Less than a year later, Mrs. Barish found another cancer through a self-examination. And last month, her yearly mammogram picked up yet a third cancer. 
 "It was the early detection that saved my life," said Mrs. Barish, the president of 1 in 9, a Long Island advocacy group for breast cancer treatment and research. "All anyone knows is that early detection gives women like me the best chance for survival. Two of my mammograms found cancers that couldn't be felt and had no symptoms." 
But for many Long Island women, the early detection that mammograms can provide is now harder to come by. An increasing number of radiologists are no longer offering the test, and this means that women are having to wait six weeks to five months for appointments. Radiologists make the distinction between screening mammograms, for women with no symptoms, and diagnostic mammograms, for women with symptoms like breast pain or lumps. The diagostic tests can usually be scheduled in a week or at most, two.
"Screening mammograms are not cost-effective, so many radiologists are getting out of the field," said Dr. David A. Fisher, the chief of radiology at ProHealth Care Associates in Lake Success. In his own office, which employs six radiologists who do about 5,000 mammograms a year, the wait is about six weeks.
"We don't make any money on mammograms," he said. "We lose money." 
Despite some recent studies that call conventional wisdom about annual mammograms into question, the American medical establishment, including the American Cancer Society and the National Institutes of Health, recommends that women age 40 to 69 be screened at least every two years. 
After lung cancer, breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in the United States and the leading cause of death among women age 15 to 40. The cancer society estimates that one woman in eight will develop breast cancer sometime during her life. Last year, nearly 200,000 women -- and 1,500 men -- were diagnosed with breast cancer, and 41,000 women died from the disease. 
In Nassau County, state Health Department figures show that breast cancer is diagnosed in about 1,000 women each year, and the same number in Suffolk. In both counties, breast cancer occurs more often than in other parts of the state. Statewide, there are 104.1 cases per 100,000 women, but in Nassau, the rate is 115.6 cases per 100,000 women, and in Suffolk, 118.2 cases per 100,000 women. The state's mortality rate from breast cancer is 26.7 deaths per 100,000 women each year; in Nassau, 27.4 deaths per 100,000 women and in Suffolk, 28.6 deaths per 100,000 women.
Last year, Congress raised the Medicare reimbursement base rate for mammography from $69 to $81.81, but that is less than it costs a doctor to do the test, generally $100 to $150. 
"Out of the reimbursement we receive," Dr. Fisher said, "our expenses include paying the doctor, the nurse, the technician, the front-desk person and the person who bills the patients and collects the reimbursement. Then there's the cost of leasing the mammography equipment, developing and storing the films and file-room personnel. Most doctors aren't in it for the money, but they still have to survive."
Although Mrs. Barish credits mammograms with detecting her cancers early, she is realistic about the difficulties in making the test available and in scheduling appointments. "It's a supply-and-demand problem," she said. "Our population is aging, and there's a greater demand from women who are 40 and older to have screening mammograms, but the supply of doctors who provide them is decreasing."
Precise numbers are hard to pin down. Charles K. Showalter, senior director of government relations at the American College of Radiology, which represents 30,000 radiologists and radiation oncologists, said that his organization "keeps track of facilities but not of individual radiologists who leave the field."
"The problems of access for women is going to continue," he added, "unless we can increase the supply of radiologists and mammography becomes more economically viable."
According to the Food and Drug Administration, the number of certified imaging centers New York State dropped from 725 in 2001 to 690 in April. On Long Island, health officials said that 5 of 58 imaging centers have closed in Nassau County this year alone. But in Suffolk County, for reasons that are not clear, the number increased from 44 to 49 last year.
Dr. Robin Ehrenpreis's office, Northern Imaging in Great Neck, is open six days a week and handles about 50 mammograms a day. Even so, the wait is two months to see a radiologist (there are two), and five months to see Dr. Ehrenpreis herself. "The waits are very anxiety-provoking for women who are not accustomed to planning six months in advance for a routine X-ray," she said. "It's a big concern."
Dr. Ehrenpreis is also a partner in the five offices of the Nassau Radiologic Group, where the waits are shorter, generally one to three weeks.
The reasons for the shrinking pool of radiologists who do mammograms are many, Dr. Ehrenpreis said: "Mammograms are very difficult to read, they offer the lowest reimbursement, they involve among the most stringent federal regulations and quality controls, and the patients who get them are the most litigious."
Mammograms are difficult to interpret, which is why problems arise. "Mammographies comprise less than 5 percent of what radiologists do, but more than 50 percent of the lawsuits," said Dr. Paul A. Fisher, an assistant professor of radiology and surgery at Stony Brook Medical Center and the chief of imaging at the Carol M. Baldwin Breast Care Center in Setauket, which screens 11,000 women each year. "Reading and interpreting a mammogram is absolutely a judgment call. Even the very best radiologists in the world only see 85 percent of cancers. It's not a perfect test, and people are human. They miss things."
Many radiologists admit that interpreting what they see on mammography films is tricky. "It's an art based on science," said Dr. Stephen A. Feig, the director of breast imaging at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. "There's a variability in interpretive skills, but if there's a question, patients should always get a second opinion."
Recently, Dr. Feig and a colleague at the University of California at Los Angeles conducted a survey of 211 senior radiology residents. Sixty-five percent said they would not consider a fellowship in breast imaging, and 63 percent said they did not want to interpret mammograms in their future practices. Fear of lawsuits and inadequate pay were the chief reasons, Dr. Feig said.
At the Breast Care Center, Dr. Fisher said, women have to wait up to two months for an appointment. "So many for-profit breast imaging centers are closing that there's a net transfer from smaller to larger facilities," he said. "But even so, we lost over $200,000 last year. Ideally, women should never to have to wait for a screening, because that's when a woman's life flashes before her eyes." 
Although radiologists may complain about the litigious bent of their patients, several medical insurers on Long Island said that radiologists pay less for malpractice insurance than some other medical specialists: $47,000 a year for radiologists, by one estimate, compared with $124,000 for obstetricians and gynecologists, and $166,000 for neurosurgeons. 
With mammograms, most lawsuits stem from misread results. Dr. Harvey F. Wachsman, a former neurosurgeon who has been a malpractice lawyer in Great Neck for 20 years, said, "A false positive means there's a lot of mental anguish but no cancer, but a false negative means there's a cancer that wasn't detected or treated."
The problem is that some radiologists should not be handling mammograms at all, in Dr. Wachsman's view, and others should be more careful. "Not all radiologists are qualified to read mammograms," he said. "Some just glance at them and miss a cancer. And that missed cancer is usually found in a relatively young married woman with children whose mammogram was misread."
"I say that every suspicious mammogram -- no matter how small the suspicion -- should be aggressively addressed by a biopsy," Dr. Wachsman added. "When you compare the minimal discomfort of a biopsy to possibly death, the risk-benefit analysis should always err on the side of caution." 
New technologies -- digital mammography and magnetic resonance imaging -- offer the prospect of making mammograms more accurate and easier to get. In digital mammography, X-ray images of the breast are transmitted to a computer screen. Doctors get clearer images of dense tissue and can make more precise diagnoses. They can also transmit the images quickly to other doctors for consultations.
Magnetic resonance imaging takes cross-section images of the human body using a strong magnetic field and radio waves instead of X-rays.
"As doctors start doing more digital mammograms and screenings with M.R.I.'s, where the reimbursement is greater, fewer of them will leave the field," said Dr. Ehrenpreis, the radiologist.
An exception to the long waits on Long Island is the Breast Imaging Center at Nassau University Medical Center in East Meadow, its two vans and four satellite clinics: Freeport/Roosevelt, Elmont, Westbury/New Cassel and Hempstead. Together they handled 7,765 screening mammograms last year, at no cost to county residents. 
"We do screening and diagnostic mammograms within a week of a woman's making an appointment," said Christine D. Mancuso, the nurse who serves as the program's coordinator. 
Although popular wisdom says that screening mammograms save lives, two recent studies call that contention into question. A Canadian study of 40,000 women, published in The Journal of the National Cancer Institute in September 2000, reported that for women in their 50's, yearly mammograms combined with physical breast examinations by trained clinicians did not reduce death rates any more than physical exams alone. And an article in The Lancet, published last October, said that Danish researchers had concluded there was no reliable evidence that regular mammograms reduce the risk of dying of breast cancer for any age group.
Barbara Brenner, the executive director of Breast Cancer Action, an advocacy group in San Francisco, agrees. "Mammography is a flawed test that misses an average of 10 percent of all tumors, and as many as 25 percent of tumors in women younger than 50," she said.
On the other side of the fence, several legislators are pushing to make mammograms easier to get. Senators Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, and Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, sponsored a bill last year "to increase mammography reimbursement rates, increase accessibility and decrease the waits for women," Senator Schumer said.
The closing of breast screening centers, he added, "is especially alarming for women in Nassau and Suffolk Counties, where breast cancer incidence is, respectively, 11 and 13 percent higher than incidence statewide."
A co-sponsor of the House version of the bill is Representative Peter King, Republican of Seaford. "There is not a family on Long Island that hasn't been impacted by breast cancer," Mr. King said. "It's important that women get screened early because this is one disease where early detection works. We're trying to do everything to remove the long waits for women and the roadblocks and disincentives for doctors."
Mr. King said that although the timetable for the bill was uncertain, "I think we have a better than 50-50 chance of pushing it through."

HEADLINE: Nassau Police Budget Fight Hears an Echo of Sept. 11 

BYLINE:  By PHILLIP LUTZ 

 BODY:
LAST September, in the hours and days after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, Long Island police officers in the hundreds rushed to help out in New York City. Many of the officers who stayed on the Island were reassigned to guard places deemed vulnerable to terrorists or otherwise went on high alert.
 During that month, while the antiterror mobilization was at its peak, the number of reported crimes and arrests for major crimes dipped in both Nassau and Suffolk. But the following month, as the terror threat began to ease and the police started to return to their normal duties, the number of arrests and reported crimes in both counties jumped. 
 Those are the statistics, and no one is disputing them. But there's plenty of disagreement over what they mean, and that argument has entered the debate between the Nassau County police union and the new county executive, Thomas R. Suozzi. In a package of proposed tax increases and spending cuts intended to close a projected $428 million gap in the county budget, Mr. Suozzi wants to wring $30 million in concessions from the union, in part by cutting some 300 officers from the 2,800-member force. 
All sides are using Nassau's low crime rate -- the lowest among counties its size in the country -- to justify their positions on staffing and other issues. Mr. Suozzi has said the crime rate in Nassau has remained low despite previous reductions in the force. Gary DelaRaba, the president of the Nassau County Police Benevolent Association, has said the crime rate shows that the size of Nassau's police force produces good results.
Siding with Mr. DelaRaba, some crime experts said the increase in arrests in October may have reflected a surge in activity by criminals who thought that the police were either distracted or too few in number to be able to do their duties. That, especially in light of the potential for another terrorist attack, would argue against cuts in police staffing, they said.
"After 9/11, Nassau and Suffolk sent a significant number of officers to New York City," said Harvey W. Kushner, the chairman of the criminal justice department at the C. W. Post Campus of Long Island University in Brookville. "The bad guys probably knew that and took something of an advantage." If so, he added, it would "absolutely, 100 percent" argue for a correlation between the size of the police force and the crime rate. The implication is that if Mr. Suozzi allows the Nassau police force to shrink, crime in the county will rise.
But Anthony Cancellieri, Nassau's deputy county executive, said, "I don't think you can connect any increase in arrests post-9/11 to anything that happened on 9/11." Told that Professor Kushner had suggested that would-be criminals might have been taking advantage of the situation, Mr. Cancellieri said, "Obviously, a lot of them got caught."
According to the Nassau County Police Department, its officers and other police forces in the county made 407 arrests on charges of murder, rape, robbery, burglary, aggravated assault or larceny in September 2001. That figure, down 17 percent from the month before, was the lowest for the 26 months in the reporting period, which was January 2000 to February 2002. In October 2001, the Nassau police made 540 arrests, up 133, a 33 percent increase from the month before.
The Suffolk County Police Department, which covers most of the county aside from the East End, made 398 major-crime arrests in September, down 11 percent from the previous month. In October, the number jumped to 513, up 115, a 29 percent increase.
In both counties, the increases were the biggest month-to-month gains in the 26 months, both in absolute and percentage terms.
Like arrests, reported criminal activity surged in October after dropping the month before. Reported crimes in Suffolk, which dropped by 7 percent in September, rose by 12 percent the next month, to 2,996. That was the highest figure in the 26-month period. Reported crimes in Nassau, which dropped by 11 percent in September, rose by 15 percent the next month, to 1,654. The reports of crimes in Nassau, unlike the arrest statistics, do not include its two cities and about 10 incorporated villages, out of 64 in the county, that have their own forces.
An August-to-September drop-off in total arrests and reported crimes in both counties in 2000 raises the possibility that seasonal factors played a part in the declines during the same period in 2001. But Officer Michael Irise, a Nassau police spokesman, said "criminals went on a moratorium" in September 2001.
Nora V. Demleitner, a law professor at Hofstra University in Hempstead, suggested that even would-be criminals might have been stunned after the attacks. "Everybody was so shocked," she said. "Petty crimes seemed so irrelevant at a time of national crisis."
Professor Demleitner said that a sharp, across-the-board increase in larceny statistics in October 2001 strongly suggested that conditions specific to the climate after Sept. 11 were the major factor driving the overall increases.
Larceny, she said, is a type of crime that might be especially encouraged by a real or perceived absence of police. Thus, while the police may have been unusually energetic on returning to activities after the period of intense duty in September, she said, the increases in arrests in October were more likely a proportionate response to increased thievery. "People thought the police were otherwise occupied," she said. 
Or as Officer Irise put it: "The moratorium was over." Criminals, he said, "made up for lost time."
J. Leonard Samansky, who was the emergency management chief under Thomas S. Gulotta, Nassau's county executive at the time of the attacks, said that by Sept. 12, some 400 Nassau police officers were directly involved in the response to the disaster, aiding in communications, searching for bombs, guarding federal buildings, patrolling New York Harbor and manning a roadblock set up on the Long Island Expressway near the Queens-Nassau border to keep people from going into New York City. He said the Nassau County police maintained a major presence in the city for 18 days and continued to provide services for several weeks afterward.
Like the Nassau police, officers from the Suffolk County Police Department began to mobilize within hours after the terrorist attacks, said Philip Robilotto, the Suffolk police chief. About 200 officers were sent into the city for about five days, after which the force was cut back to about two dozen, maintaining a Suffolk police presence in the city until early 2002.
Meanwhile, in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks, the Suffolk police secured Brookhaven Airport, Republic Airport and Long Island MacArthur Airport. Patrols were stepped up at smaller airports around the county. 
Nassau officers earned about $6.5 million in overtime for their work, said Michael Kornfeld, communications director in the county comptroller's office. The costs pushed the number of officers in Nassau who earned more than $100,000 in 2001 to 1,300, up from 900 in 2000. Suffolk police earned almost $1.8 million in overtime after the attacks, about a quarter of which paid for the initial securing of the county's airports, Chief Robilotto said. Both counties have applied to federal and state agencies for reimbursement, most of which is expected to come from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Chief Robilotto said the commitment strained his department's resources. "I only have 2,700 cops, and I still had a county to run," he said. But officials in both counties said that officers who normally performed other duties were called on to fill in for street officers sent to the city. "There was no period when Nassau County was underprotected," Mr. Samansky said. Chief Robilotto said, "We didn't strip ourselves."
Professor Kushner said that in the event of similar emergency, a smaller police force might put the public at risk. He said the Nassau police should hire 175 new officers from a civil service list that will expire in October. Estimates of the first-year costs for the new officers range from $7 million to $11 million.
The force has already lost more than 300 officers in the last two years as a result of attrition. So far this year, 84 officers have retired and none have been hired, said Officer Wayne Hartmann, the Police Benevolent Association's sergeant at arms. 
Mr. Suozzi plans to save money and ease the impact of force reductions on public safety by moving officers now on desk and clerical duty into street patrols, replacing them with civilians who earn less. Since May 2000, 40 civilians have been hired to replace retiring Nassau County officers, said Detective Thomas Mazur, a spokesman for the department. In Suffolk, 60 positions were "civilianized" last year, Chief Robilotto said.
In the past, Nassau police officers have expressed strong reservations about civilians' taking jobs that police had handled. They still do, especially when it comes to certain station house positions. Still, at least some seemed resigned to the likelihood that the practice will grow. "It may be the wave of the future," Officer Hartmann said.
Professor Kushner noted that while demographic factors like the aging of the population have also contributed to the low crime rate, the department had provided "unmatched" service. "If it's not broke," he said, "why fix it?"
But despite critics' concerns, Mr. Cancellieri said: "There will probably be a hit to the police budget somewhere down the road. I just don't know how big or where." 
Whether Nassau voters will endorse such cuts is still an open question. While some Nassau taxpayers have expressed anger over police salaries, which now average more than $100,000, surveys show the public remains very concerned about terrorism and crime. In a recent survey by RoperASW, a polling company in New York, those two topics ranked first and second on a list of Americans' personal concerns, eclipsing economic issues.
"People don't like people playing politics with public safety," said Anthony Santino, the press secretary for the Nassau Republican leader, Joseph Mondello. As for the political impact of Mr. Suozzi's plan, "it's a situation where the jury is still out," Mr. Santino said.

HEADLINE: Habitats/Hastings-on-Hudson, Westchester; 
Opening Up Their House To Let the River Views In

BYLINE:  By TRISH HALL

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH the house didn't exactly turn its back to the river, it didn't embrace it either. But Gavin Macrae-Gibson and Dr. Nonnie Balcer were attracted to it anyway. Built in the 1930's, the house stood on a hill in Hastings-on-Hudson in a neighborhood where the winding roads follow paths originally laid out by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, who designed Central Park. 
 The house was in such poor condition that "the real estate broker didn't even want to show it to us," said Mr. Macrae-Gibson, 46, an architect with his own practice in Manhattan. But he and his wife, at the time a banker with J. P. Morgan, could imagine its potential, and they liked Hastings, a half-hour train ride north of Manhattan in Westchester County. A liberal town where people hide their SUV's in the garage, it has long been known as a hospitable place for artists, writers and intellectuals. 
 So 10 years ago, Mr. Macrae-Gibson and Dr. Balcer bought the house, leaving their home in Jersey City "just as the last screw was being put in the kitchen," she said. They moved in with their two young sons and embarked on a decade-long renovation that they have only recently finished.
The most drastic changes came in the first month of owning the house, when they ripped down walls and added large windows to let in the light and the river views. They eliminated the separate living room, dining room and sun room and created one long flowing space parallel with the Hudson River. 
THEY brought the river into their house, too, by cutting down some of the trees that stood in front. "You couldn't see the river out of the window at all," Mr. Macrae-Gibson said. "Now you can see it from every window, which is the unifying point."
Their passion for the river is evident throughout the house. Over the mantel in their book-filled living room is an abstract landscape of the Hudson River by Ellen Hopkins Fountain, a contemporary Westchester artist. "We're very interested in the notion of a new Hudson River School," Mr. Macrae-Gibson said. Other paintings in their house were also inspired by the river, which reminds Dr. Balcer, 48, of her childhood home in Montreal and the St. Lawrence River. About six years ago, Dr. Balcer, who has a Ph.D. in economics from Cambridge University in England, retired from banking and is now a vice president of the local historical society.
At the same time they opened up the ground floor, they took the roof off of the house and enlarged the top floor, turning an attic into a light-filled master bedroom suite with a bedroom as well as an exercise room, a walk-in closet and a bathroom, complete with a laundry chute. "I love laundry chutes," Mr. Macrae-Gibson said. "They're like secret passages."
The creation of the top floor was a revelation. "It was amazing to rip off the roof and see this," he said, pointing to the expanse of the Hudson.
That first year, they were so excited about their house that even before the top floor was closed in "we had an Easter dinner up here, open to the elements," she said. It still provides the best place for viewing the river, which seems to envelop the house. In front of it, at a small table on a laptop computer, Mr. Macrae-Gibson, who grew up in England and came to this country to go to Yale, is working on a book about architecture in Manhattan, including some of his own projects.
After almost two years of renovating the house, they took a break. "It was pretty brutal," Mr. Macrae-Gibson said. "Now in all honesty I can say to my clients, 'I feel your pain.' "
But after a few years they dived in once again, restoring the brick porch in the back of the house and doing the decorating that they had never had time for. They finished the basement and made it hospitable for their sons, Rory, now 14, and Malcolm, now 11. They also built a room for Dr. Balcer's loom and all of her yarns. 
"It was something I always wanted to do," she said, but there was never time to weave and be a banker and a mother. Now she makes fabric for herself and her friends, and her mother told her something she never knew before. "My two great-grandmothers were famous weavers," she said. "My genetic makeup was calling me."
Finally she and her husband worked their way to the kitchen, now a bright compact space with a peninsula and a natural flooring like the one Mr. Macrae-Gibson chose for the Ottendorfer branch of the New York Public Library in the East Village, which his firm restored. 
The renovation, which cost about $275,000, did not of course have to take 10 years. But Mr. Macrae-Gibson said that he is so busy finishing work for his clients on residential, commercial and institutional projects that it was hard to find the time to do his own home.
"We're like the shoemaker's family," Dr. Balcer said cheerfully and without a hint of reproach. And indeed, her husband may have preferred not to rush things. 
"It takes years," he said, "to make a good pair of shoes."

HEADLINE: For Developers, Brownfields Look Less Risky 

BYLINE:  By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
BY the end of the decade, if the developer's plan follows schedule, a dreary 1.87-square-mile stretch of closed municipal dumps that litter the New Jersey Meadowlands in the towns of Lyndhurst and Rutherford is to be transformed into a parklike setting with golf courses, hotels, housing and offices. The upgrading is being done largely with private capital, rather than government expenditure, reflecting changes in recent years that have made redevelopment of polluted lands more attractive to developers. 
 The Meadowlands have been an eyesore for generations, but efforts by government to force landowners to clean up their property using litigation and regulation have often been ineffective, in part because of difficulties in identifying and pursuing legally responsible owners of sites that might have changed hands, and uses, many times. 
 But recently the private sector has been finding ways to make money cleaning up the lightly contaminated properties called brownfields. A key part of the new attention to contaminated lands is the comfort level afforded by increased experience with the cleanup process. Another is the increasing availability of insurance to cover various risks in such projects. And underlying the activity is a characteristic shared by many of the polluted sites: they are convenient to both transportation and to urban areas that were once the source of workers for vanished factories and are now the source of prospective shoppers and home buyers. 
The Meadowlands project is being undertaken by EnCap Golf Holdings, a company backed by Cherokee Investment Partners, a large venture capital fund that has specialized in brownfield projects for the last decade. Other companies have raised capital to invest in environmental projects, promising investors high returns.
Recent actions by the federal government has made brownfield cleanup predictable and attractive as a business option, according to real estate specialists. President George W. Bush signed the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfield Revitalization Act earlier this year, a law that recognized that lightly contaminated brownfields are in a different category than the badly polluted sites covered by the law commonly known as Superfund. 
The brownfield act doubles, to $200 million, the federal assistance to states and communities to help clean the 500,000 to 1 million brownfields that the Environmental Protection Agency estimates are scattered across the land. The act also increases the liability protection for landowners who participate in the voluntary cleanup programs now established in more than 40 states. Under Superfund, a landowner can be held liable for the entire cost of a cleanup, regardless of who was responsible for the contamination or whether an owner made good efforts to control damage.
"The new federal law provides a more realistic assessment of risk," said Charles Bartsh, a senior policy analyst with the Northeast-Midwest Institute, a Washington-based research organization. "When these things become a line item, not a black hole, is when things can really take off."
Previously, the virtually unlimited liability inhibited development of brownfields, in part because lenders have been reluctant to get involved in sites that they might wind up owning if the developer goes out of business. However, some states have taken measures to limit the exposure of people participating in the voluntary cleanups. Some have also recognized that sites to be used for industrial or commercial uses do not have to be as clean as those used for residences, playgrounds or schools.
In recent years, insurance companies have developed policies that provide a cap on a developer's financial risk. And pools of private capital have been assembled to invest in brownfield development, with the promise of high returns.
Meanwhile, cleanup technology has been developed to a point that assessments of the extent of contamination can be made and the cost of cleanup reduced to a number.
With these tools in hand, developers can evaluate whether a given project makes economic sense. "You have to look at each site as a real estate deal," said Charles Kramer, the president of Brookhill Group, a New York company specializing in brownfield redevelopment. "The fact that a site is contaminated is an issue and a cost component to be added in. In the end it is another line item."
Thomas Darden, the chief executive of Cherokee, which is based in Raleigh, N.C., stresses another basic consideration. "The real driver in this business is land use issues," he said. "There is an increasing interest in communities to have development in the urban core." Not only is Cherokee backing the ambitious $1 billion, 1,200 acre Meadowlands project, but another affiliate, OENJ Cherokee, is managing a project to turn the old city dump in Bayonne into a golf course and an effort to convert a contaminated waterfront site in nearby Woodbridge Township into an auto importing center to relieve some of the pressure on the Port Authority's docks in Newark and Elizabeth.
National statistics about brownfield development are notoriously difficult to come by because definitions vary and there is little uniformity among state reporting systems. Nevertheless, the National Brownfields Association, a trade organization, has reported that, based on environmental insurance policies purchased, the total spending for goods and services by companies cleaning up brownfields totals $1 billion to $1.5 billion a year and is growing at a rate of 15 to 20 percent annually. However, this does not account for the value of the properties involved.
"No one defines a brownfield and no one wants their property on a list of brownfields, so hard data is hard to find," said Robert V. Colangelo, publisher of Brownfield News, the publication of the association. But he said some corporations that in the past simply sat on property rather than recognize environmental liability are beginning to seek ways of unlocking the value of those holdings.
"There has been a shift of philosophy regarding brownfields," Mr. Colangelo said. "Superfund was a stick program. Now people are looking at the end use of a property once it has been cleaned up. That is a sustainable approach."
Corporate real estate is the largest potential market for brownfield remediation, said Jack Thomas, president of the Brownfields Recovery Corporation of Boston. He said business should grow "as corporations warm to the concept that liability can be transferred and that they can walk away with a strong sense of comfort. But it is slow."
Mr. Thomas's company is involved in a project to develop Admiral's Wharf, a 40-acre site on the West Branch of Stamford Harbor in Connecticut. The site, contaminated by petroleum products left by a coal gasification plant decades ago, is to be developed into a complex of 620 living units, 275,000 square feet of office space, a ferry terminal and a 275 to 300 slip marina.
CLEANUP costs of $10 million to $15 million were included the sale price of $40 million negotiated between the developers and the previous owner, Northeast Utilities.
Mr. Thomas said he and some partners got into the brownfield business in the mid-1990's and initially focused on industrial properties. "One of our first projects was a manufacturing-warehouse building that had a big spill that was the economic downfall of its owner," he said. "We bought it, addressed the environmental problems, put on a new roof and new mechanical systems. We got environmental insurance, which satisfied a Wall Street lender, got our cash out and went on the next project."
He said the company was currently involved in a 1,160 acre waterfront site in St. Croix in the United States Virgin Islands that was formerly an alumina smelter. He said the intention was to redevelop the site with a waste-to-energy power plant, a water desalinization plant and port facilities.
Mr. Thomas said some investors had been willing to participate in these projects because of the promise of high returns and the availability of environmental insurance. "As we have grown, our access to capital has grown," he said. He asserted that the availability of capital and insurance have been far more important in the development of the brownfield business than greater flexibility in state regulations.
Joseph Cotter, the president of the National RE/sources Company of Greenwich, Conn., said he was able to raise $100 million in 1996 to do brownfields and other redevelopment projects and has been applying the funds since then.
"Our company does business with large corporations," he said. "We buy the site and take title." One example, he said, was the Home Depot store in Derby, Conn., which is built on the site of an old ironworks. "A Home Depot store is basically a warehouse," Mr. Cotter said, "and it can live with a different cleanup than a residential development."
Since big box stores require 10 acres of land for their format, they are often forced to deal with contaminated industrial properties to find suitable locations in crowded metropolitan areas like New York. 
Mr. Cotter said his company was also involved in the planned reuse of the old Otis Elevator site in Yonkers and the Sperry-Rand site in Lake Success.
Joseph L. Boren is president of American International Group's environmental unit, which has become one of the largest providers of insurance for brownfield projects in recent years. He said the business had "grown substantially over the last five years."
When brownfield projects were first proposed in the late 1980's and early 1990's, he said, insurance was not available because insurance companies did not have enough experience with them. "Environmental insurance was the great unknown," he said. "It was not commonly known that you could control risks."
But with experience has come knowledge, and companies like American International Group now offer policies with considerable confidence in their pricing. "We now have insurance products that do two things that make the brownfields business go," said Kenneth Cornell, an executive vice president of AIG Environmental.
The first, he said, is insurance that puts a cap on cleanup costs. This helps to protect a developer from financial disaster if the actual cost of a cleanup is a lot higher than the company had estimated.
The other is to cover the cost of dealing with the situation if more pollution is found after the supposedly clean land has been sold. "The seller has to give indemnification to buyers," Mr. Cornell said. "So this protects against things you don't know about."
As with others in the field, the insurance executives say that success in brownfield redevelopment lies with the underlying real estate transaction. "A brownfield is a real estate transaction on contaminated property," Mr. Cornell said. "The environmental uncertainty is removed because of the insurance."
Mr. Darden said Cherokee bought insurance to cover its projects because even with the experience of treating more than 300 properties, the company might still make mistakes. "It is very unusual for us to buy a property without drilling a lot of holes in it, but we still get surprised," he said. 
"And we have found when we do find a lot more pollution than we expected, the costs are usually 100 percent greater than the estimate."
He said that the insurance helps cover the cost of the overrun but that the insurance companies require sizable deductibles. 
The project that Cherokee is backing in the Meadowlands is based on the site's proximity to the golf hungry New York metro area and the hills -- some as much as 120 feet high -- created by generations of dumping municipal and industrial refuse, which has been covered with soil. The project, originally planned as a 99-year lease, was delayed as state officials decided to sell the land to EnCap. 
William Gauger, president of EnCap, which is based in Tampa, Fla., said the first phase of the Meadowlands project is scheduled to commence on Sept. 1 of this year and is expected to take six to eight years to complete. The plan is to reshape the land to make it suitable for golf courses and to bury the garbage even more deeply, possibly using soil dredged from New York harbor as part of the channel deepening program for the seaport.
The additional capping is intended to reduce the amount of rainfall seeping through the old landfills, which leaches toxic materials out of the dumps and carries it to nearby waterways. The water that does seep through is to be treated and reused. The site will be encircled by a 20-foot-deep buried wall to prevent uncontrolled seepage.
The project is being designed by Robert A. M. Stern Architects of New York and Torti Gallas & Partners of Silver Spring, Md. They are working with EDAW Inc. of San Francisco, which specializes in environmental planning and landscape architecture.
Mr. Gauger said treating the site to make it suitable for construction was expected to take three and a half years. The actual building could take an additional three to five years, he said. 
The company has taken control of most of the land already, although some remains tied up in litigation. Officials of the Hackensack Meadowlands Development Commission, which controls planning in the area, have said they would prefer to collect rental fees from developed property rather than continue operating dumps.
Phase 1 of the Meadowlands project is to include 27 to 36 holes of golf on both sides of the western spur of the New Jersey Turnpike. Renderings of the project show a Kingsland Golf Course, named for one of the old dumps on the site. Another course is named for Berry's Creek, an unlovely stream that flows through the area.
Each of the golf courses would have its own clubhouse, and the developers say at least 18 holes would be reserved for public play. The project will be about 60 to 65 percent in the town of Lyndhurst, with the rest in Rutherford.
Plans call for the project to be connected to a new station on New Jersey Transit's Bergen rail line, which would provide access to the site from the New Jersey suburbs and New York. The plans also include two hotels. One is to be a business hotel with 400 rooms near the rail link, and the other would be a 350 room resort hotel with a conference center.
Six office buildings with a total of 1.2 million square feet of space are included, along with 100,000 square feet of retail space. About 1,500 units of housing are to be built, with 50 percent reserved for people 55 years or older and the balance to be open market housing.
Other details include a senior citizen clubhouse, a golf academy and four athletic fields: three for baseball and one for soccer.
The first stage of development is scheduled to cover 700 acres of land. The second phase would cover the remaining 500 acres and would include more golf and related developments. About 200 acres of the area would remain as wetlands; where wetlands have to be filled, an equal amount of new wetlands are to be built, developers say.
Mr. Darden of Cherokee said the Meadowlands' proximity to Manhattan gives the land value, despite the environmental problems. Mr. Gauger said EnCap acquired the property for about $12 million, which he characterized as a low price that recognizes the additional costs of cleanup and capping.
"There is a notion that developers and communities are only interested in sprawl," Mr. Darden said. "That has changed. People are interested in downtowns, they want to live downtown." Since most older areas come with pollution problems from past industrial times, these properties must be treated before they can be reused, he said.
The business of cleaning and reusing brownfield properties may have moved from a voyage into the unknown to a fairly normal real estate business, but it still has some unusual challenges.
Irving Cohen, president of OENJ Cherokee, said development of the golf course in Bayonne had been slowed by a lack of dredge material to bury the old garbage. Federal officials have been slow to issue contracts to deepen the port and until that happens, the Bayonne site will remain more brown than green.

HEADLINE: In Florida, Prime Site Thrives After Cleanup 

BYLINE:  By JOHN HOLUSHA

DATELINE: SARASOTA, Fla. 

 BODY:
EVER since he moved his Harley-Davidson dealership from downtown last December to a site near an exit from Interstate 75, the main north-south route in the western part of the state, sales of motorcycles and accessories have surged, said Rick Rossiter, the dealer.
 The attractively located site was not available for development until recently because the soil and water in the area were contaminated by solvents discharged from a nearby military electronics plant, creating a brownfield. 
 But years of processing by on-site treatment plants have reduced the underground plume of solvent contamination, which had spread from the plant to most of the 40 acres of vacant land nearby; now the pollution is limited to the plant itself and a few isolated patches. 
The Brookhill Group, which bought the land and arranged for the cleanup sold three acres to Mr. Rossiter so he could have a bigger parking lot for visiting bikers, a larger showroom and repair area. Indeed, he is negotiating for adjacent land to establish a used-motorcycle business.
Other parcels closer to the highway have been sold so a bank branch, a restaurant and a hotel can be constructed, although the latter will probably be delayed. 
"It cost approximately $3 million to clean up the site," said Charles Kramer, president of Brookhill, which specializes in finding contaminated land and redeveloping it for other uses. But it has to be the right land, he notes. "If I-75 was not here, the economics would not work," he said.
"This was all agricultural in the past," said Leon DiLieto, a broker with Michael Saunders & Company. But, he said, as land values have increased, offices are taking the place of feed stores and industrial plants. 
"There are offices going up north to Tampa and south to Naples," he said, concentrated near I-75 exits.
This kind of development is good for the region's economy, said Nora Patterson, a Sarasota County commissioner. "This is an opportunity to bring jobs to the area via I-75," she said. "Around here we have wealthy retirees and low-paid people who serve the retirees, and not much vitality in between." JOHN HOLUSHA

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
Ivy League Or Also-Ran? Does It Matter?

BYLINE:  By TOM REDBURN

 BODY:
THE long march is almost over. This week, my daughter, like countless other high school seniors, will choose which college she will attend in the fall. Does it make a difference where she goes?
 It does to us, of course. But within the economics profession, there is a vigorous debate over whether highly selective and highly expensive colleges -- like most of those to which our daughter, Emily, applied -- confer any real benefit in later life. 
 Recent research by Alan B. Krueger, an economics professor at Princeton University (can't get much more selective than that) and Stacey B. Dale, a senior researcher at Mathematica Policy Research, a consulting firm, suggests that it does not. They found that students who chose a school with lower admissions standards over a more competitive school earned incomes just as high as those who attended the elite college.
A fat paycheck isn't everything -- far from it. But what that means, Mr. Krueger explained, is that a student accepted at the University of Pennsylvania, a prestigious member of the Ivy League, would be just as well off going to Penn State, which some people know more for its football team than its academics. Most intriguing, the research found that even students rejected by a highly selective college did as well as those who attended it.
"The best school that turned you down," Mr. Krueger said, "is a better predictor of your future income than the school you actually attended." It's the person, not the place, that matters: students who apply to schools for the ambitious are ambitious enough to do well just about anywhere.
So what does this mean for parents? First, it's supposed to be comforting; you can console your child that the rejection letter from Brown doesn't really hurt.
And it suggests a cunning strategy: Apply to Harvard or Yale but then go to the college that offers the best deal. That's partly a joke, but I wouldn't be surprised to see a lot of second-tier colleges -- the kind that offer generous merit aid to talented students -- using Mr. Krueger's theory to persuade high-school graduates to choose, say, Denison or Lewis & Clark, over Williams or Stanford. No doubt there's some truth to that argument for some students.
Now, like most fathers, I think I know what's best for my daughter. Funny how she has her own ideas, though.
As she culled through the acceptance letters, I thought Wellesley, the most prestigious name on the list, would push her the hardest to succeed.
"All girls," she replied. Exactly. No boys to distract her.
What about Pomona College in Southern California, where my wife and I met?
"It never snows," I told her.
"Too far away," she said. "I'd never see you."
What parent can argue with that?
For her, the choice has come down to two colleges. The well-known and nearby Wesleyan University, in Middletown, Conn., is a classic New England liberal arts college that prides itself on its diversity. It usually attracts several students every year from her high school; one of her best friends already goes there. Carleton College, a hidden jewel in the Midwest, is more obscure, but it has a better program in math, which she loves, and is close to Minneapolis, where her favorite aunt lives with her family.
WE'RE fortunate that she has such good colleges to choose from and that we can afford to send her anywhere she wants to go. But this also makes clear that the choice of a college is about a lot more than how much money our children will earn in their future careers.
For one thing, what about those who choose a lower-paying but socially valuable career like teaching over something like public relations or investment banking? Are they to be treated as less successful than the class goof-off who mostly drinks and parties but ends up making a lot of money after taking over a car dealership?
Beyond that, many parents care a lot about the academic atmosphere fostered at the colleges their children attend. We want bright faculty members who will challenge them to think harder, and we hope that they will meet interesting people and develop richly satisfying lifelong friendships.
And other academic research, somewhat counter to Mr. Krueger's, still suggests that having lots of smart, motivated fellow students in a concentrated place provides something immensely valuable.
"We're coming up with hard evidence," said Gordon Winston, an economist at Williams College, "that being surrounded by other bright, demanding students has a real effect on academic performance."
In the end, both sides of this economic debate point to one common conclusion: find a challenging college that's a good fit. As a parent, I want what's best for my children. But the decision should be up to them.

PERSON: Michael Buckley 

HEADLINE: Private Sector; 
An Unflappable Banker Is Tested

BYLINE:  By BRIAN LAVERY

DATELINE: DUBLIN 

 BODY:
ROUND 9 p.m. on Feb. 4, Michael Buckley, the chief executive of Allied Irish Banks, received a long-distance telephone call, the kind that bankers dread.
 A currency trader named John M. Rusnak at Allfirst Financial, Allied Irish's subsidiary in Baltimore, had run up hundreds of millions of dollars in losses over five years, in trades that presumably should have been detected much earlier. 
 The news hit Mr. Buckley, on the job for only nine months, as he was about to announce record 2001 profits for Allied Irish, the biggest bank in Ireland. Those profits were now slashed in half by one of the biggest scandals since the rogue trader Nicholas W. Leeson brought down Barings Bank in 1995. 
"The degree of shock that I was affected by was on the same scale as a family bereavement," Mr. Buckley said in a recent interview, his first since results of a formal investigation were released on March 15.
Mr. Buckley, 57, had offered to resign, but the bank's directors convinced him to stay. He has since been in crisis-management mode from the scandal, which caused $691.2 million to disappear from the bank's books. He has traveled to Washington, Baltimore and New York to meet with regulators, oversee a reorganization at Allfirst and calm nervous investors, some of whom think Allied Irish should not only sell Allfirst but also get out of the American market.
Mr. Rusnak, who was fired, is cooperating with prosecutors in the United States. No criminal charges have been filed, and it remains unclear whether others at Allfirst or Allied Irish, or other banks, might have been involved.
Despite the distraction of the scandal, Mr. Buckley said: "I have a lot of energy; I'm blessed for my age. It hasn't been getting me down." 
Friends said Mr. Buckley was no stranger to handling stress. He spent two years in the 1960's training to be a Roman Catholic priest before switching to get a master's degree in philosophy at the National University of Ireland. He landed a position in the Finance Ministry, helping to write national budgets, and for 10 years taught political philosophy on the side at University College Dublin.
He does not attribute his reserved demeanor to his time in the seminary -- a period he remembers with some amusement.
"It took me about two years to discover women -- and what they might do to you," he said during a radio interview last year with RTE, Ireland's state broadcaster, in explaining why he quit the seminary. "There was a fundamental crevice between being a priest and having any sort of relationship with women." (Mr. Buckley is now married with two daughters and a son.)
At the news conference here to present the investigative report about the scandal, Allied Irish's chairman, Lochlann Quinn, became red-faced and flustered under intense questioning and eventually evicted all television cameras. Mr. Buckley responded to questions in measured and deliberate tones.
"He gives the wrong impression of being one of these slow, country men," said Padraic Fallon, an Allied Irish board member and a London-based publisher. "He's a strange man to see in 2002. He's more the kind of man you would see in 1955."
Dermot O'Brien, a former Finance Ministry colleague of Mr. Buckley and now chief economist at NCB Stockbrokers in Dublin, called him "the most unflappable guy I ever saw in that job."
Mr. Buckley moved to NCB in 1986, rose to managing director and helped convince the government to build the International Financial Services Center, a 27-acre office complex in Dublin's derelict docklands. With tax breaks and other incentives, it attracted companies like Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank and became an important contributor to a turnaround of Ireland's economy. But when the center was still a blueprint, he said, "Nobody ever believed that you could do something like this in Ireland."
Now he is facing similar skepticism about the American business of Allied Irish. Banking industry analysts in Dublin and London say a relatively small European institution like Allied Irish has no place in the highly competitive American retail banking business. Yet Mr. Buckley has said that Allied Irish will keep Allfirst, which it has owned for nearly 20 years.
He expressed admiration for regional American banks, like Fifth Third Bancorp of Cincinnati and M&T Bank of Buffalo, saying "the intensity of your franchise is what matters, not the size." 
Mr. Buckley said he wanted to expand Allfirst through acquisitions. But for now he is still dealing with the aftermath of the scandal. Six Allfirst executives were fired, while two others -- Frank Bramble, the Allfirst chairman, and Pat Ryan, Allied's group treasurer -- resigned. Risk management and foreign exchange trading procedures are now centralized through Dublin.
After news of the scandal first broke, there was some expectation that Mr. Buckley would resign himself. He had been told of possibly suspicious trading by Mr. Rusnak last May, but Allfirst executives had assured Mr. Buckley that nothing was wrong.
"It took a bit of persuading" by Allied Irish's board to convince him to stay on the job, he said. "I tendered it on a belief that, when you look at accountability, that you can't stop at any particular level in a company. The buck, as far as I was concerned, stopped with me."
But losing Mr. Buckley would have left the bank leaderless at a time when it was considered particularly vulnerable to a takeover by its acquisitive British neighbors, Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays Bank. And the Bank of Ireland, Allied Irish's main domestic rival, has expressed interest in a merger.
"At the end of the day, the whole thing was a mess, and it was very difficult to apportion blame," Mr. Fallon, the board member, said. "There wasn't anyone at a senior position in the group whom we could fire, that was the really frustrating thing."
Although the final chapter on the scandal is far from closed, Mr. Buckley says Allied Irish's employees have "a fantastic sense of ownership" in the company. He said many had expressed support for him. "They see this, very much as I do, as the defining challenge of their lives."

BYLINE:  By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
FIDELITY INVESTMENTS has more than $1 trillion under management, so its $22 billion in funds focusing on foreign markets is relatively small change. Too small, in the opinion of Fidelity, the nation's largest portfolio manager, which is trying to raise its profile in international investing.
 The company has improved the performance of its international funds relative to that of its peers. In the three years through March, according to Morningstar Inc., Fidelity's international funds fared better, on average, than two-thirds of all international funds; in the three years ended in March 2000, Fidelity was beating fewer than 60 percent. 
 Fidelity executives attribute the improvement to technological enhancements and strengthened research capabilities. Outside commentators agree that these have been big factors, but they also say Fidelity has been helped by a conservative management style that is better suited to the difficult global market conditions of the last two years than to the preceding bull run. 
Philip Bullen, who oversees Fidelity's international funds, prefers to focus on the benefits the company gains from "scale and size and having resources," including more than 200 analysts worldwide.
"On the buy side, we don't think anyone else has that scale," Mr. Bullen said. "Because of the philosophy we have of recruiting analysts from top schools, we have an incredibly strong and in-depth pipeline of people." The best ones, he said, go on to manage Fidelity portfolios.
Mr. Bullen also pointed to technology systems that allow better communication among far-flung offices. The international funds that Fidelity sells to Americans are managed from its Boston headquarters, but many analysts are based abroad to be near the companies they follow. Fidelity also offers funds to foreign investors, but they are run by a separate entity in Britain.
Emily Hall, a Morningstar analyst who follows Fidelity's international funds, agreed that the company's size, and the research expertise and scope it could buy, provided an advantage. But she said its international funds had also benefited from missteps in the 1990's that led Fidelity to become a low-risk manager.
"In the early to mid-90's Fidelity got burned by big bets on individual countries or sectors," Ms. Hall recalled. "The funds calmed down as a result; a lot of them are much more aware of whatever benchmark they have. The funds as a whole have become somewhat more conservative and are not taking wild risks anymore. They are not turning in barn-burning performances but have turned into steady offerings."
Bill Blevins, managing director of Blevins Franks International, a financial advisory firm in London, also said the cautious approach could hurt performance if investors found a new appetite for risk. "Fidelity seemed to go into a more conservative phase, and of course this has been rewarded in the last couple of years," he said. "It remains to be seen if this approach will reward investors as markets recover and a more dynamic approach becomes necessary."
Still, so far, so good. In the three years through March, according to Morningstar, Fidelity's international equity funds rose 4.9 percent, on average, versus 0.7 percent for all international equity funds. Fidelity's two international bond funds have been more impressive, up 17.8 percent a year, on average, over three years, while the average international bond fund was up 2.8 percent.
Fidelity's $22 billion in funds investing outside the United States is less than what some of its rivals manage abroad. American Funds, for instance, has $93 billion in funds that invest overseas and Janus has $30 billion, according to Standard & Poor's. Franklin Templeton has about the same amount as Fidelity in international funds and the Vanguard Group has $19 billion.
Fidelity's large number of funds results in a variety of recommendations from analysts and advisers. Eric M. Kobren, executive editor of Fidelity Insight, an independent advisory newsletter, likes Fidelity's Europe Capital Appreciation and Europe funds. "I think Fidelity has some great international funds," he said. "Europe Cap and Europe should benefit from a rebound in the global economy."
James Stack, editor of InvesTech Market Analyst, likes two other Fidelity funds, Japan and Japan Smaller Companies.
Ms. Hall recommends Fidelity Diversified International, its flagship foreign fund and a solid performer for many years. Its longtime manager left a year ago to start his own money-management firm, but his replacement, William Bower, has maintained the fund's strength, keeping it in the top 10 percent of international funds.
Mr. Bower relies less on the quantitative methods -- using data screens to select stocks with desired characteristics or to eliminate those with undesirable ones -- favored by his predecessor, Gregory Fraser and more on Fidelity's researchers. When he took over, Mr. Bower expanded the fund's inventory of small and midsize stocks, as well as technology and media stocks. Recently, however, he has been lightening up on technology.
MS. HALL was less enthusiastic about other funds. "I think Fidelity runs some decent international funds," she said. "Not all of them are stellar. A lot of them are segmented, like the individual country funds. Why do they even have them? Does anybody really need Fidelity Canada?"
She described funds run by one manager, Richard R. Mace Jr., including Overseas and Global Balanced, as "lackluster," saying they "don't take a lot of risks and as a result have not turned into shining stars." The funds have done slightly better than average for their peer groups over the last one and three years. His Worldwide fund has beaten close to 90 percent of its peers in the last year, and three-fourths of them over three years. 
Mr. Mace said that "what some people misunderstand is I maximize risk-adjusted performance."
"I consider the relevant index as a baseline and take bets against the index when prudent," he added.
Difficulty in emerging markets has eroded many portfolios, and Fidelity's have not been immune. Fidelity Emerging Markets has had seven managers in 11 years. It ranks in the bottom 1 percent among international funds over five years, largely because it was heavily invested in Asia when the region's economy collapsed in 1997.
"It has kind of been a problem child for them," Ms. Hall said. But under its new manager, John H. Carlson, a veteran of Fidelity emerging-markets bond funds since 1995, the fund "has found religion and become somewhat conservative," Ms. Hall added.
While managers of other Fidelity international funds usually pick stocks and then consider what macroeconomic factors might affect performance, Mr. Carlson looks first at countries, in an effort to avoid the upheavals that take down even the best investments in emerging economies. Only then does he pick stocks.
"The first rule of thumb is: Don't blow up," Mr. Carlson said. In the debt funds, he added, "that has allowed us to handily outperform the index over long periods." He is trying to apply that rule to the stock fund, whose returns have been roughly average over one and three years.
Is Fidelity correct to start crowing about its international funds? Taken together, Ms. Hall said, the funds deserve middling grades. "They're doing a good job, but not anything unusual or extraordinary, beyond the number of funds they offer," she said.
She said several firms -- American Funds, William Blair, Julius Baer and Tweedy, Browne -- "all run international funds as good as or better than Fidelity's."
"Any fund shop is not a monolith," she added. "It can have some good ones and some rotten ones. Fidelity has more better ones than ones that are not good."

In a Large Family, Many Views on Investing

BYLINE:  By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
FUND managers at Fidelity Investments say they are given great freedom to pick stocks. While they all have access to the same research, there is no house view that compels any of them to own shares in certain industries or countries.
 As a result, William Bower, who runs the Fidelity Diversified International fund, has been selling technology stocks, and Richard R. Mace Jr., who manages three smaller funds, has been buying technology shares. 
 Owning such stocks "worked out well over the last nine months of last year, but we have been catching our breath lately and have pared down the fund's aggressiveness," Mr. Bower said. With expectations running high for improvement in technology sectors, he said, "the risk-reward in these names has gotten a bit dicey." 
"I'm just not convinced the recovery is going to be as strong as the market is telling us," he added. "Looking out two or three years, I'm cautious on technology."
Mr. Mace, by contrast, noted that "some of my largest bets have been in tech," notably semiconductor makers like Samsung Electronics in Korea and two in Taiwan: Taiwan Semiconductor and United Microelectronics. 
Producers of copper and aluminum also have prominent places in his three funds -- Fidelity Overseas, Fidelity Global Balanced and Fidelity Worldwide. He expects the metals companies to benefit as an economic recovery takes hold. Two companies he mentioned are Rio Tinto, the British mining company, and Alcan of Canada. 
Mr. Bower has been using the proceeds from his tech-stock sales to "nibble on energy and health care."
When the global economy sputtered last year, drug stocks were favorites because of their steady earnings streams. Lately, however, "people are giving up on them, saying they are cyclical, but they are not," he said.
"Over the last four years I was underweight Big Pharma," he added. "I'm buying now because everyone is starting to hate them. I think it's going to be the same story: Good companies with good pipelines are going to deliver the numbers and people will say, 'What a great business opportunity they are now.' "
Among his choices are GlaxoSmithKline of Britain and Aventis of France. Smaller health care companies he likes include Altana, a German drug maker, and Nobel Biocare, a Swedish maker of dental implants.
Mr. Mace said he likes another large drug maker, AstraZeneca of Britain, on the strength of a new cholesterol drug, Crestor, which could become "the most effective drug at improving cholesterol of any on the market." The company is seeking approval for the drug in the United States.
The energy stocks owned by Mr. Bower tend to be out of the mainstream. They include Suncor Energy, a Canadian business that extracts crude oil from sand. He likes Canadian energy companies because they would have no risk of disruptions if the Middle East conflict escalated. But they would reap the full benefit if the conflict drove oil prices higher. He does not own giants like the Royal Dutch/Shell Group and BP.
Mr. Mace, who is neutral on energy, nevertheless owns one of the industry leaders, TotalFinaElf of France, which he says has had "good production growth, consistent cost-cutting over the years and a discount on valuation." CONRAD DE AENLLE

Looking Far From 7th Ave. to Revive Leslie Fay

BYLINE:  By LYNNLEY BROWNING

 BODY:
AT the American Image Awards last month in New York, a glittering gathering of the fashion retailing world, John Pomerantz received honors for his nearly three decades at the helm of the Leslie Fay Company, one of the country's oldest and, at one time, most popular dressmakers. 
 But on Seventh Avenue in Manhattan, in the heart of the fashion industry, the spotlight is on John Short, Leslie Fay's little-known new chief executive. Mr. Short, a former banker and onetime underwear and sunglasses executive, spent eight years in Europe and Asia with Esprit, the trendy clothing maker, but has no experience in the women's apparel industry in the United States. 
 Mr. Short has a tall order at Leslie Fay, where sales of dresses for work and social occasions have shrunk amid the casual revolution of recent years. The American dress market peaked in 1997 at $8.9 billion in sales, but by last year it had contracted by a third, to $6 billion, as consumers turned to informal pants, skirts, jackets and blouses, said Marshal Cohen, president of NPD Fashionworld, a fashion research company in Port Washington, N.Y. 
Mr. Short recalled that before he took the job, someone told him, "You'd really better be sure you want to do this, because the dress business is in a death spiral."
Leslie Fay, which sells through national department and specialty stores and off-price outlets, is also being buffeted by its outdated, polyester styles, the growth of private-label brands and the rise of "cheap chic" separates at stores like Target and H&M, the fast-growing Swedish chain. 
Founded in 1947 by Mr. Pomerantz's legendary father, Fred, who named the company after his daughter, Leslie Fay had sales of more than $859 million at its peak in 1991. Then, Leslie Fay, a recognized name among career women for its no-nonsense, affordable dresses and other outfits, towered over the rival Liz Claiborne. But Claiborne has since eclipsed it in sales and prestige. Other competitors include Jones New York, which is part of the Jones Apparel Group, as well as Sag Harbor and private labels like Kathie Lee, sold through Wal-Mart.
In 1993, accounting fraud at Leslie Fay forced it to restate its profits for 1991 and 1992. The company spent 1993 through 1997 in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Its former chief financial officer, Paul Polishan, was sentenced in January this year to nine years in prison for fraud. 
BY last year, sales at the reorganized company, which was forced by creditors to sell Sassco Fashions, its most profitable division, in 1997, had declined to around $170 million, according to Three Cities Research, a private-equity firm in New York that owns about 75 percent of Leslie Fay. That was down from $197 million in 2000, Three Cities said, and far below Leslie Fay's target last year of around $230 million. Leslie Fay was publicly traded until November.
The company still makes moderately priced dresses under its own label and higher-priced dresses under the David Warren, Rimini and Trio New York names. Under its Leslie Fay Haberdashery and Joan Leslie labels, it also makes sportswear, coordinated ensembles of dresses, pants, jackets, blouses and skirts. It does most of its manufacturing overseas.
After the fraud scandal, the company expanded its sportswear business, acquiring Cynthia Steffe, a women's casual sportswear line, two years ago. But dresses still account for about 70 percent of Leslie Fay's revenue, said Mr. Pomerantz, who remains the chairman. In 2001, the company picked up the license to manufacture higher-end dresses for Liz Claiborne and its Elisabeth plus-size line.
Last year, as many apparel makers cut prices, Leslie Fay raised its average price 10 percent, Mr. Cohen of NPD said. The move hurt sales and forced markdowns that led to a 39 percent plunge in revenue from sales through department stores like Dillard's, Macy's and Lord & Taylor, among Leslie Fay's top distributors, NPD said. The stores shifted unsold inventory to discount retailers like T.J. Maxx and Marshall's. 
Not all has unraveled. Retailers' orders have been brisk for Leslie Fay Sportswear, a line of moderately priced knitted ensembles that replaces a brand once known as Outlander, said Roseanne Cumella, a merchandising manager at the Doneger Group, a fashion industry consulting firm.
Leslie Fay may be seen as frumpy and slow to change. But in Mr. Short, 53, it has a leader who is irreverent about dress codes and quick-paced in temperament.
Belying his past as a button-down corporate banker for Citibank in Venezuela, Ecuador and Hong Kong in the late 1970's and early 80's, he had his trademark ponytail and wore no tie at the black-tie awards ceremony last month.
Still, Mr. Short is hardly laid back. "He is manic and driven and determined," said John Botts, chairman of Botts & Company, an investment management firm in London, who has known him for more than a decade.
Mr. Short has a master's degree from Thunderbird, a graduate school of international management in Glendale, Ariz., and majored in economics and Spanish at Dartmouth. His financial experience and ability to analyze a company's numbers make him a rare -- and valuable -- creature in the fashion world, Mr. Botts said.
Mr. Short declined to be specific about what he had done at Leslie Fay since assuming the job on March 20. He said only that he faced "a huge learning curve" and was reviewing all business lines with Mr. Pomerantz, who was president or chief executive from 1972 to 1999.
Mr. Short "is better in growth situations, not in structured environments," Mr. Botts said.
Willem de Vogel, president of Three Cities, said that Mr. Short would trim production costs by improving forecasting for orders from retailers and that he would tighten internal management procedures to produce better-quality garments, faster and at lower cost. Mr. Short has been pushing Leslie Fay's new president, Linda Larsen German, who created the successful Elisabeth line at Liz Claiborne, to spiff up Leslie Fay's designs quickly, Mr. Vogel said. 
Mr. Short may be envisioning a future in which dresses are no longer Leslie Fay's mainstay business. "If you go into a dress department today, there are dresses and then there are a lot of two- and three-piece garment combinations, like a pant with a soft jacket," he said in a brief interview. Such sportswear, he said, "is the way the market has evolved, and the consumer is telling us she likes that."
Mr. Short is also a big investor in Leslie Fay, having bought a stake of at least 10 percent -- he declined to be more specific -- after the previous chief executive and president, John Ward, resigned in January. Leslie Fay's other shareholders are Constable Partners, an investment firm, and other senior executives. 
Before joining Leslie Fay, Mr. Short was chief executive, president and chief operating officer of Joe Boxer, the whimsical underwear maker. There, he sold excess inventory to prepare the financially troubled company for sale to private investors. Before that, he was executive vice president of the American and Canadian operations of Sunglass Hut International. 
At Esprit's Asian headquarters in Hong Kong in the late 1980's, he pared the list of suppliers, organized licensing brands and helped the company go public on the local stock exchange. Later, as head of Esprit Europe and Esprit's global licensing operations, he pushed to integrate the licensing companies and the American arm of the company, but he clashed with one of Esprit's founders, who deemed the moves too brisk and too bold, said Richard Baker, the chief executive of Ocean Pacific, the surf wear-inspired clothing company.
Birgit Kelley, a retail consultant and former colleague of Mr. Short's at Esprit, recalled: "A lot of his ideas were implemented only in pieces. He's sometimes a little too fast for his own good."
He quit Esprit to move to Paradise Valley, Ariz., near Scottsdale, where his two children and their mother, from whom he was getting a divorce at the time, had settled. He commuted by plane to Joe Boxer in San Francisco and to Sunglass Hut in Cincinnati. He is still commuting about twice a month between Arizona and New York City and plans to buy a country house in upstate New York.
At Leslie Fay, Mr. Short "will get that first pass as not of Seventh Avenue and not having the right skill set," Mr. Baker said. Mr. Short reportedly was not among the dozen or so candidates whom recruiters originally vetted for Leslie Fay. "But he's a quick study," Mr. Baker said. "This is a very unique choice to run a brand like this on Seventh Avenue."

Birth Control Is Changing, and Its Price Is Rising

BYLINE:  By MICHELLE ANDREWS; Michelle Andrews is a freelance writer in Manhattan specializing in health care. Her column on its economics appears the third Sunday of each month. E-mail: moneymeds@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
FOR decades, the main weapons for preventing pregnancy have been condoms, birth control pills and sterilization. Sure, other methods are available, and there have been innovations from time to time, but none have quite caught on to the same extent.
 That may soon change. Two contraceptives will be introduced this summer that will significantly enhance women's options. And if the new methods are as popular as many family planners say they will be, they might even make a dent in the 49 percent rate of unplanned pregnancy in the United States. 
 But there are problems already. The new contraceptives -- a skin patch that is replaced weekly and a vaginal ring that is used for three weeks at a time, each releasing contraceptive hormones -- may not be readily available to poor women. Public clinics, like those operated by health departments and Planned Parenthood, may not be able to afford these new methods for the 6.5 million women, mostly poor and young, that they serve.
The National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association, which represents many of the 7,000 public clinics, says that so far the best rate it can get from Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical, the Johnson & Johnson unit that makes the Ortho Evra patch, is about $15 for a monthly supply. While that is far less than the retail price of $30 to $40 a month, it is still substantially higher than what public clinics pay for oral contraceptives. (Negotiations on the vaginal ring, called the NuvaRing and made by Organon, haven't begun. The retail price, however, is also expected to be $30 to $40.)
With so many kinds of birth control pills on the market, competition has helped to keep a lid on their prices, and manufacturers have given deep discounts to clinics. A one-month supply of pills, which normally goes for $30 elsewhere, may cost a clinic just $1.50. Of course, there is no such price competition for the patch or the ring.
But family planning organizations don't begrudge the drug companies their rates. "Ortho-McNeil has just spent hundreds of millions developing the patch," said Judith DeSarno, chief executive of the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association. "They're doing their best to figure out how to give us a bigger discount."
Ms. DeSarno says public clinics have felt especially squeezed lately -- they're seeing more patients who are uninsured or not enrolled in Medicaid, while spending more on screening and treating diseases. At the same time, she said, financing for Title X, the only federal program dedicated to family planning, has been flat. In fact, when adjusted for inflation, it declined 57 percent from 1979 to 2001.
It wasn't always this way. "Contraception for all" may not be the phrase most associated with the presidency of Richard M. Nixon, but in 1969 he asserted that "no American woman should be denied access to family planning assistance because of her economic condition." He called for more money for flexible family-planning programs, and Title X followed a year later.
Title X is still the backbone of the system, though it doesn't appear to be a priority for President Bush. For the fiscal year that begins this October, the president has proposed $265 million for the program, about the same as this year. Education programs on teenage abstinence, however, would get a $33 million increase, to $135 million.
In the long run, though, the president's Title X budget may cost the government more than it saves. According to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit group that focuses on reproductive health research, for every public dollar spent on family planning services, $3 is saved in Medicaid spending on pregnancy and care for newborns.
Researchers say Ortho Evra and the Organon NuvaRing are nearly 100 percent effective in preventing pregnancies, a rate similar to that for birth control pills. But they may be more effective than oral contraceptives in one crucial way: women don't have to remember to take a pill every day, and forgetfulness is one reason that 7.5 percent of women who are on the pill become pregnant during their first year.
DOROTHY MANN, executive director of the Family Planning Council, which oversees 85 publicly financed clinics in the Philadelphia area, sees the patch and ring as good birth-control options, but she worries that she won't be able to afford them for her clinics.
Eighty-four percent of the clinics' 120,000 clients receive contraceptive services. This year, her budget for contraception is $1.32 million, or a little more than a dollar a month for each patient, before insurance and Medicaid reimbursements. If, as expected, the patch or the ring end up costing more than what she essentially allocates for each patient, she may have to severely ration the devices.
"You have to make horrible choices," she said. "It has always been our practice to provide all birth control methods to all women, regardless of income. But I don't think I can do that anymore."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: WEST VILLAGE; 
Will the PATH Train Stop Here? Concerned Nonriders Hope Not

BYLINE:  By DENNY LEE 

 BODY:
It's nothing personal, New Jersey. It's just that residents of Greenwich Village are sensitive about preserving their hamlet.
 To ease crowding at the city's southernmost PATH stations, the Port Authority plans to add second entrances to the stops at Christopher Street and Ninth Street. Ever since the PATH station at the World Trade Center was destroyed on Sept. 11, ridership at those two stops has doubled, and there is sometimes a 15-minute wait just to get to the turnstiles. 
 Under the plan, two new staircases would open onto Christopher Street: one at the southeast corner of Bedford Street, where P.S. 3 is situated, and the other at the southeast corner of Waverly Place for the Ninth Street stop. To accommodate the new entrances, the street would be narrowed by four feet.
But Village residents say the plan will tarnish landmark streetscapes, create a traffic bottleneck, and invite twice as many loiterers and petty criminals. 
"You couldn't pick a worse place," said Scott Schindler, a graphic designer who lives on Bedford Street. "You've got a school there, a very narrow street, and it's just thick with cars." 
Preservationists are especially concerned about the Waverly entrance, which would fall inside the Stonewall Historic District, the only gay-related site in the nation named as a National Historic Landmark. 
"The stairs could have the impact of turning a historic side street into a major transit way," said Andrew Berman, executive director of the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation.
Residents want the Port Authority to put the new entrances on two busier thoroughfares, Hudson Street and Avenue of the Americas. But authority officials say that their plan is more economical and less disruptive. "This is the simplest and most direct means of getting people in and out of the system," said William Fellini, manager of the PATH Capital Program. 
He also said community opposition must be balanced against safety concerns. With only one entrance at each station, Mr. Fellini said, it now takes more than 18 minutes to evacuate riders in an emergency. With a second entrance, the time would be shaved to seven minutes. 
No timetable for construction has been set, but for PATH riders, the new entrances could not come too soon. 
"The residents are being a little high-strung, and definitely selfish," said Ann Walsh, a bookkeeper from Jersey City, who was displaced from the World Trade Center station. "There's always this confrontation with people from Jersey." DENNY LEE

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH; 
Telecom May Have Bargains, After All

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
INVESTORS are famous for loving stocks when they should be leaving them and bailing out when they should be buying with both hands. Many top Wall Street analysts encourage such behavior by downgrading stocks just as they hit bottom.
 With that in mind, it seems a good time to survey the slag heap that is the telecom stock sector. Surely, some jewels lie buried there, cast off in recent months by dispirited investors. 
 The telecom train wreck, of course, has been one of the messiest ever for investors. Many companies were brought public by Wall Street in the late 1990's, and billions of dollars in capital was raised for them. Now, a good many of these start-ups have filed for bankruptcy. Telecommunications equipment shipments plummeted 26 percent last year. And telecom shares turned in the poorest performance of the top 10 industry sectors in the Standard & Poor's 500 in the first quarter of 2002. By one estimate, investors have lost $1.4 trillion since telecom stocks peaked in 2000.
Two years later, the sector contains some compelling values, according to some astute fund managers picking through the wreckage. 
Martin J. Whitman, manager of the Third Avenue Funds and a veteran value investor, says he is buying shares of telecom equipment manufacturers. Mr. Whitman is worth listening to: the underappreciated stocks he provided to this column last Sept. 23 have risen, on average, 31 percent.
He is careful to examine companies' balance sheets before he buys, and he limits his purchases to companies with cash positions that significantly exceed their total debt. An analyst at Third Avenue Funds, Ian Lapey, contends that while the industry is depressed now, demand for voice, data and video transmission will grow in coming years. So telecom equipment makers that can weather the storm today will be the beneficiaries tomorrow.
Mr. Whitman's picks may not rise immediately. Earnings in the sector are expected to be dismal this year and may never again reach the heights seen during the telecom bubble. 
Nevertheless, the companies he favors are not overpriced: they either trade below 10 times their peak earnings or at less than two times their book value. 
Given the speculative nature of these companies, Mr. Lapey and Mr. Whitman have bought a group of them. One or two of them may flame out, but there is some safety in numbers. 
The Third Avenue Funds basket of telecom stocks consists of ADC Telecommunications, Ciena, Comverse Technology, Corvis, JDS Uniphase, Sycamore Networks, Tellium and Tellabs. All but one of the stocks trade at less than $10 a share.
A final recommendation in the distressed telecom sector comes from Marlowe Burke, an analyst at JHC Capital, a value investing firm in Greenwich, Conn. Ms. Burke is a believer in Allegiance Telecom, a provider of telecom services to businesses. "Allegiance was not attractive to us when analysts were pushing it at around $100 a share," she said. "But at $2.25, the valuation is out of step with reality."
Fearing that the company will not achieve the revenue target it needs under the terms of its bank loans, investors have dumped Allegiance shares. But Ms. Burke thinks the company will hit the number. "We think there's great value in the company in terms of their growth in data services," she said, "and they are picking up assets from distressed companies very inexpensively, which will help them manage their costs effectively." 
Unlike the Internet highfliers that crashed, some telecom companies that are still standing have paying customers and real earnings potential. Because they can no longer raise fresh capital from investors, Wall Street has abandoned them. But shrewd investors need not follow suit.

CORRECTION-DATE: April 28, 2002

 CORRECTION:
The Market Watch column last Sunday, about possible bargains among telecommunications stocks, misstated the investment position of the Third Avenue Funds in a basket of eight issues that it found attractive. The company owns one of the stocks, Tellabs, not all of them; it is studying the others further for possible purchase.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: UPPER EAST SIDE; 
European Taste Lured to New York by American Money

BYLINE:  By ERIKA KINETZ 

 BODY:
Last month three Frenchmen -- two alumni of Christie's and a great-grandson of the painter Camille Pissarro -- set up an art gallery on East 70th Street. 
 "All of our clients live around the neighborhood," explained Franck Giraud, one of the three. "As simple as that." The gallery, Giraud Pissarro Segalot, is a one-room showroom on the second floor of a 19th-century townhouse, with furniture by Jean Prouve and Le Corbusier. 
 New York has long attracted European art dealers, and the reason is clear. "Americans have more money than anyone else," said Dominique Surh, director of a gallery on East 73rd Street that Salomon Lilian, an Amsterdam dealer, opened in October.
Now, however, the attraction is growing much stronger.
Last year for the first time, the United States captured a larger share of the $23.5 billion global art market than did Europe, according to David Kusin, an economist and the founder of Kusin & Company, a Dallas research firm. In a recent study for the European Fine Art Federation, Mr. Kusin found that European gallery and auction sales totaled $10.6 billion last year, while American sales hit $11 billion. From 1998 to 2001, Europe's share of the art market fell by more than 6 percent, while America's grew by nearly 7 percent.
These numbers may be global, but it is New York that is at their center. Mr. Kusin estimates that two-thirds to three-quarters of the American sales take place in New York.
There is widespread agreement that the appetites and pocketbooks of American collectors are the main forces drawing European dealers to New York. But Anthony Browne, chairman of the British Art Market Federation, says that regulatory issues also play a role. By setting up shop in New York, some European dealers can avoid penalties under certain European tax and property laws. 
The Upper East Side has been the beachhead for these new immigrants. 
"It's the place that gets the press," Mr. Kusin said. "People in Paris live on the Avenue Foch, and they assume that if they lived in New York they'd live on Fifth Avenue or Park Avenue."
If current trends persist, establishing a foothold in New York may become de rigueur for European art dealers.
"There is a realization in Europe that the axis of the art market has shifted to New York," said Michael Goedhuis, a British dealer. In January, Mr. Goedhuis shifted the headquarters of his contemporary Chinese art business to East 76th Street from London.
Another newcomer is Patrick Derom, a Belgian dealer who opened a gallery in Brussels in 1986 and merged with a gallery on East 79th Street in 1999.
"People would not give me important paintings unless they knew I had a permanent presence in a very important art city," he said.
But while the business of art thrives here, at least some dealers suggest that the hotbeds of artistic creativity lie elsewhere, such as Germany, Japan, Belgium, England and China.
In New York, "a lot of young artists decide to be artists, but they also think of the dollar behind the work," said Christophe Van de Weghe, a Belgian dealer who opened a gallery on the Upper East Side in 2000 and recently moved to Chelsea. "I think people are more able to focus on their creativeness in Berlin."
Mr. Goedhuis added: "Here artists are groping for a theme. In China, artists and writers and poets are grappling with deadly problems, problems of life and death of real concrete relevance to their spiritual lives." ERIKA KINETZ

HEADLINE: PRELUDES; 
Suddenly, 67 Looks a Lot Closer

BYLINE:  By ABBY ELLIN; Abby Ellin is a Manhattan writer. Her column on starting out in the world of money appears the third Sunday of each month. E-mail: preludes@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
I HAVE a confession: Until recently, I gave Social Security and its possible reform about 7.4 minutes of thought.
 I'm not proud to say that, but retirement just seems so distant. It's hard enough thinking about what I'll do next weekend, let alone when I'm 67, the estimated age when people born after 1960 can retire with full benefits. There are a million things to contemplate -- deadlines, children, marriage, houses -- before worrying about the golden years. 
 Is it psychologically sound, after all, to prepare for the last years of your life when you're still undecided about its current direction?
"I'm too busy to think about it," said Vanessa Lundborg, 31, a fashion designer and owner of Miracle on St. Marks, a clothing boutique in Manhattan's East Village. "Anyway, the propaganda is that by owning my own business I'll come out ahead. I have enough faith in myself."
Faith in yourself is one thing; faith in the system is quite another. Whether we will even have Social Security when we're older is a good -- and scary -- question.
It's especially important for women, who typically earn less than men and often take time off from work to raise their children, thus diminishing the Social Security money they can get back later in life. (Another consideration: The average life expectancy for men is around 74; it's 80 for women.)
Certainly, the numbers indicate that not all is rosy on the retirement front. When Social Security began in 1935, there were about 40 workers for every retiree. Today, the ratio is just three to one, and in 20 years it will be down to two.
A study by Laurence J. Kotlikoff, an economics professor at Boston University, and Willi Leibfritz, an economist in Munich, found that a 25-year-old worker can expect to pay $175,000 more in Social Security taxes over his lifetime than he can expect to receive in Social Security benefits. A 55-year-old, however, would pay only $4,000 more. 
Nearly every pollster north of Tijuana has conducted some kind of Social Security survey, and the results are contradictory and confusing. So are the "expert"analyses. 
A March poll, for instance, found that 71 percent of people 18 to 34 years old supported change in the current system. "Younger people are generally antigovernment, so it doesn't surprise me that they're in favor of reform," said Anna Greenberg, 33, vice president of Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research in Washington, co-sponsor of the poll with National Public Radio. 
But the outlook becomes more puzzling when you consider a 1999 poll conducted by Peter D. Hart Research Associates in Washington, which found that 81 percent of people 18 to 34 supported Social Security in its current form. It also found that more people thought that "making sure that people receive a decent, guaranteed monthly retirement benefit" was a higher priority for Social Security than "making sure that people receive a better rate of return."
Jeff Mandell, 26, the director of the 2030 Center in Washington, a public policy organization for young adults, says a secure fund will benefit everyone, and in more ways than one. "Social Security guarantees young people that their parents and grandparents aren't going to knock on their door and say, 'Surprise! We're moving in!' " he said. "When you talk to young people about it that way, all of a sudden they think it's more important."
Contrary to popular rhetoric, he noted, there's still plenty of money left in the till. In an annual report to Congress last month, the trustees of the Social Security trust fund said the program in its current state would remain solvent until 2041, after which it could meet about three-quarters of its benefit obligations. "That's not nothing," Mr. Mandell said.
While that is somewhat encouraging, it still doesn't mean that my generation will get back what it paid into the system.
"The whole Social Security system is a sham," said Morris L. Reid, 31, a principal with the Dewey Square Group, a government affairs consulting firm in Washington. "We need to look at its performance from top to bottom, and I don't have a lot of confidence that it will be there when I'm ready for it, or that anyone in Washington has a credible plan."
Then there's the Third Millennium, an organization in New York that also represents Generation X. The group favors the ideas outlined by President Bush and his Commission to Strengthen Social Security, including the establishment of personal retirement accounts.
"The issue is whether you're in favor of maintaining the present system or carving out a small portion from the current FICA tax and allowing workers to invest that in a personal account," said Richard Thau, 37, the organization's president, who believes in partial privatization. "If you let every American worker ages 20 to 39 set aside 2 or 3 percent of their gross annual income for retirement investing, and let that money grow over the course of 40 or 50 years, by the time they reach 70 or 75 they will have nice size nest egg to complement Social Security."
That makes sense in theory, although it doesn't help the people who aren't well versed in the intricacies of the stock market. The rich will get richer, and the poor will suffer. 
AS for me, I basically view Social Security the way I view washboard abs: something to aspire to, but something that I'll most likely have to live without. Part of me hopes that a random benefactor will swoop down from the heavens and voluntarily sponsor my retirement, but I realize that this is unlikely. So I've set myself up with an Individual Retirement Account and other savings plans.
The real issue is what will become of those less fortunate, less educated and less prepared financially. And what of Franklin D. Roosevelt's words when he signed the Social Security Act, to "take care of human needs" and to "provide for the United States an economic structure of vastly greater soundness"? Will the changes proposed today support or undermine his vision?
I am finally starting to think about all that. And, frankly, I'm worried.

HEADLINE: STRATEGIES; 
Is It Free Fall, or Just a Blip?

BYLINE:  By MARK HULBERT; Mark Hulbert is editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest, a newsletter based in Annandale, Va. His column on investment strategies appears every other week. E-mail: strategy@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
IF the stock market's plunge last September had been an earthquake, it might have measured 2.1 in magnitude -- jarring, yes, but not nearly as severe as many previous tumbles.
 Market measurements of this kind are now possible because of recent research that applies the concepts of geophysics to investing. The study, titled "How Deep Was the September Stock Exchange Crisis?" and conducted by Bertrand Maillet, a lecturer in economics at the University of Paris (Sorbonne) and Thierry Michel of the Paris Bourse, is at papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers .cfm?abstract-id=300923. 
 To appreciate the utility of the new scale, which was intended to be analogous to the Richter scale once used to measure earthquakes, consider the question that investors faced as stocks plunged last September: Was this a once-in-a-lifetime market blowout, one from which it would take several years to recover? 
Seven months later, of course, we know that it was not. But how much of this could have been surmised at the time?
In September, those who tried to interpret history could do little more than review the market's reactions to previous crises. Because the stock market, on average, was higher six months after those crises, a similar outcome was predicted after Sept. 11, too.
That view has proved correct in the last several months, but it was largely a lucky guess. After other past plunges, such expectations have proved wrong: six months after the 1987 crash, for example, the market was still 25 percent lower than it was before the crash.
In short, there has been no way to differentiate relatively mild tumbles from genuinely severe ones like the one in 1987. Many people have long assumed that sharp market downturns were exceptional events that suspended the statistical relationships of relatively normal times.
The new study, however, relies on the idea that the biggest market downturns, though infrequent, are still subject to ordinary statistical analysis -- in other words, that they are not that exceptional. For years, researchers could not see this relationship because they tried to force the markets into the template of a bell curve-- known in statistics as a normal distribution. Because huge market downturns occurred more often than could be expected if markets followed the bell-curve pattern of events, many people concluded that big disruptions were entirely unpredictable.
Bell curves, of course, aren't the only statistical patterns. Some patterns account for a greater frequency of seemingly rare events. In the language of statistics, such a pattern has a "fat tail" -- a relatively large number of apparently unusual occurrences. Other recent research has found that the markets closely follow one particular fat-tail pattern, known as a lognormal distribution. This new insight shows that sharp downturns are not exceptions to the historical rule, but rather extreme instances of what occurs all the time.
This seemingly subtle change in perspective has enabled Mr. Maillet and Mr. Michel to construct their magnitude scale. To be sure, there is no perfect financial analog to the physical movement measured in earthquakes, but the researchers think they come close by focusing on a comprehensive measure of volatility. Rather than zeroing in on volatility over just one time horizon -- daily, for example -- they constructed their measure to encompass many different periods, from a few minutes to several months.
It is on this scale that Mr. Maillet and Mr. Michel measured last September's drop as a 2.1, merely the ninth worst since 1896. On their logarithmic scale, that decline was 400 more times likely to occur than the 1987 crash, which earned the highest rating, 4.7 -- higher than even the 1929 crash, at 4.0.
More research is needed, of course, but the results are promising so far. The new measure does a decent job of forecasting volatility after a plunge -- the market is more volatile after higher readings than it is after lower ones.
To be sure, the new scale's daunting mathematics mean that most people will have to rely on others to calculate it, and it may take some time for it to become widely used. But I know of at least one research group in Zurich that has already started to do so. Will Wall Street take up the challenge?

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Measuring the Severity Of Market Shocks" A new scale for market crashes, analogous to a magnitude scale for earthquakes, places the market decline last September well down the list of the most severe of the last 106 years.

HEADLINE: The World: Oil Crises; 
Which One Is Worse?

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
THE old oil crisis: You drive the family car, a Ford Country Squire station wagon, to the new Exxon station (changed from Esso in 1973). But you've got an odd-numbered license plate and it's an even-numbered day. You can always drive less, but that means staying home, and heating oil is going to get expensive this winter, the experts say.
 The next oil crisis: You go down to the Texaco station, which still has gas, partly because Texaco's eastern states marketing operations are 50 percent owned by Saudi Arabia. But the price has doubled and your S.U.V. takes 20 gallons to fill. And you begin to regret retiring the '86 Camry, which got roughly 28 miles per gallon, in favor of the '2001 Taurus, which gets 22 miles. 
 But at least your house is heated with natural gas, not oil. Your supply is locked in at a constant cost, thanks to weather-based hedging strategies of companies like Enron. In energy crises of the 1970's, natural gas was a regulated industry and costs were kept low but supplies sometimes ran short; now it is available, at a price. Taking inflation into account, the cost of natural gas is double what it was in 1973. Similarly, gasoline price controls are over -- meaning fuel is available, but the price is variable.
Which is worse, the energy crises of 1973-74 and 1979-80, or the one that could be triggered by civil unrest in Saudi Arabia or any other crisis among exporters?
This is worth asking, as tensions rise in the Middle East, and Americans have to pay attention to political developments in places many of them can't even pronounce, the nation has a new complication: A big South American exporter has a coup and a counter-coup in a single week-end.
America has worried for years about a new oil crisis. During the Arab oil embargo, Richard M. Nixon promised energy independence. Six years later, when the shah fell and prices skyrocketed, Jimmy Carter promised a ceiling on imports. George Bush had a plan to wean cars from gasoline, and run them on natural gas, ethanol, electricity and other alternatives. All came to naught.
There are some improvements. Energy consumption per dollar of gross domestic product is down to 10,400 B.T.U.'s, from 18,400 B.T.U.'s. Even if consumers don't know what a B.T.U. is, this is good news. Better yet, B.T.U.'s of oil and gas per dollar are down by more than half, because the share of energy from coal and nuclear is up.
But demand is up, especially for oil. The number of miles driven per vehicle is up about 20 percent since 1973, and the number of vehicles is way up, by more than 50 percent since 1970. Miles per gallon was 11.9 in 1973, when the Arab oil embargo began; it was at 16.9 in the early 90's and is still there.
By 2000, America was were supposed to have millions of cars running on natural gas, ethanol, methanol and who knows what else. But the share of all transportation energy that came from alternate fuels in 2001 was less than 3 percent, down from 4.2 percent in 1973. To be fair, the total amount of other fuels rose over the period. But gasoline and diesel use rose faster. 
And the American oil patch has been bled nearly dry. Oil imports, 34 percent in the oil embargo, are now 54 percent. Persian Gulf imports, less than 5 percent of American consumption in 1973, are now 14 percent.
With more cars to drive -- about 220 million -- Americans are driving more and more. Total vehicle miles traveled was about 1 trillion in 1970, but was nearly 2.7 trillion last year.
Suggest a car pool in the station wagon and half the people you talk to will say, "What's a station wagon?" The other half will say, "What's a car pool?"

Wall Street Breaks a Long Losing Streak

BYLINE:  By SHERRI DAY

 BODY:
Although a handful of large companies reported weak first-quarter earnings last week, the major indexes rose for the first time in five weeks on the strength of results that generally beat Wall Street's expectations. 
 The big decliners included I.B.M., Pfizer and airlines like Delta. 
 But General Motors and American Express rose sharply after both companies reported earnings that exceeded Wall Street's estimates.
 Technology stocks were responsible for much of the market's gains. Novellus and Texas Instruments touched off a broad rally on Tuesday after they forecast improving sales. Better-than-expected earnings from Sprint lifted the telecommunications sector.
 Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, gave an upbeat assessment of the American economy and said the Fed would not raise interest rates until it was sure the economy was stable. 
 For the week, the technology-weighted Nasdaq composite index rose 40.64 points, or 2.3 percent, to 1,796.83. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 66.29 points, or 0.7 percent, to 10,257.11, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 14.16 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,125.17.

MarketsOvervalued, Survey Says

BYLINE:  Compiled by Jeff Sommer

 BODY:
Fund managers around the world say stock markets are overvalued, but the managers have not increased the proportion of cash in their portfolios, according to a monthly survey by Merrill Lynch. 
 The survey, involving 305 managers, was conducted during the first two weeks of April. 
 They believed that markets were trading 2 percent above "fair value" but were priced fairly a month earlier, the survey said. Sixty-two percent said companies in the United States were the most overvalued.

Wyoming's Tax Bite Is Mildest

BYLINE:  By Vivian Marino

 BODY:
Residents of Wyoming are undoubtedly drawn to the state's abundance of national parks and wide-open terrain, but there's another benefit to living there: tax relief.
 In 2001, for the fifth consecutive year, Wyoming was found to be the most tax-friendly state for families and retirees, according to survey results released last week by Bloomberg Personal Finance magazine. 
The survey ranked the 50 states and the District of Columbia based on taxes on income, sales, real estate and other assets for four hypothetical families. 
 After Wyoming, the other states earning high marks for "wealth friendliness" for families were Tennessee, Nevada, Alaska and Washington. For retirees, Delaware, Hawaii, Louisiana, and Colorado were in the top five.
The least friendly tax states for families were Maine, Wisconsin, New York, Rhode Island and Montana. The least friendly for retirees were Vermont, Nebraska, Montana, Wisconsin and Rhode Island. Vivian Marino

To the Editor:
My family story may be different from Nichole Christian's, but I hear the same words from aunts and friends. My parents fled their native land, Ukraine, in World War II, lived on the Lower East Side and saved every penny to move to New Haven. 
 The minute I finished grad school, I was in a car on my way to New York to take a job, find an apartment, make friends and fall in love. My husband and I have a beautiful 14-month-old daughter, whom we are raising in a safe, supportive community on the Upper West Side. 
 I cannot imagine doing it any other way, certainly not in the suburbs. I meet other mothers for coffee and trips to the swings, and my daughter and I take the most wonderful class. 
We will never move from here, despite terrorism, the economy and the price of a "classic six" apartment.

N.F.L.'s Newest Owner Seeks the Middle Ground

BYLINE:  By THOMAS GEORGE 

 BODY:
The face of ownership in the National Football League has been changing at a persistent and sweeping pace. The league's new owners are schooled in a new economics and in a new image; simply blending into the background is seldom a chosen path.
 The new owners prefer the sideline action to sitting in luxury boxes. New owners have a wider range of businesses than many of their peers. New owners get involved more with the coaching and the acquisition of personnel. New owners care less about sharing revenue than about their own team's financial growth. New owners want more control of their local marketing. New owners are less interested in building strong camaraderie with their peers. 
 New owners want to win -- and win now.
The pace of change among the 32 owners is startling.
Eighteen have joined the league since 1984. Fourteen have joined since 1991. Eleven have joined in the last eight years. Five have joined in the last three years. More change is scheduled: Steve Bisciotti has an option to buy the Baltimore Ravens from Art Modell in 2004.
The current group -- from the familiar presence of the Giants' Wellington Mara to the swashbuckling style of Dallas's Jerry Jones to the mild manner of the Jets' Robert Wood Johnson IV to the frenetic presence of Washington's Dan Snyder -- is more disjointed than it is a unit.
"We used to gather at our league meetings and the number of teams was small and manageable enough that everybody knew everybody and their families and it was much more cordial and family-like," said Ralph Wilson, the Buffalo Bills' owner for the past 43 years. "Now we just have meetings. And more meetings. There isn't much camaraderie. The relationships aren't as personal. There is a lot more 'me, me, me.' It's the times."
It's the league. But it has worked as the N.F.L. continues to prosper.
Now comes an owner who appears to be a cross between new and old ownership, a consensus builder, a man who has brought pro football back to Houston and says he has a plan to win with grace and style, to make money and still make friends.
That man is Bob McNair. His Houston Texans will complete their first collegiate draft today and will play their first exhibition game Aug. 5, against the Giants in the Hall of Fame Game in Canton, Ohio. Soon after is their opener Sept. 8 against -- who else? -- Dallas in Houston's new Reliant Stadium, which features the league's first retractable dome.
Using part of the wealth he gained primarily in the electric power industry, McNair, 65, bought the team for $700 million, a record for an expansion team.
Bud Adams, the Tennessee owner, is his Houston neighbor. In 1992 Adams asked McNair to get involved with the N.F.L. by purchasing the Miami Dolphins. (McNair chuckles now when recalling that he considered the asking price, $142 million, far too much.) Soon after that, N.F.L. Commissioner Paul Tagliabue asked McNair to get involved with a fledgling expansion group's bid to put a team in St. Louis. McNair waited. The league has had its eyes on McNair for a while. His heart, however, was set on Houston.
He was awarded his franchise on Oct. 6, 1999.
"The world doesn't come to an end if you don't have an N.F.L. team, but I do think that sports are a vibrant part of a community," McNair said. "I'm doing it for Houston. If we manage this properly, this can be a tool to bring people together. We have a very diverse community, and this opportunity crosses all lines and ages with a sports team that people have an affinity for.
"You win with the organization. It has to be the stable element, because players come and go. You have to have a clear vision and a plan of action. We want to do everything in our power to strengthen our relationship with our fans. I want this to be the most valuable and highly respected franchise in the world. My goal is to provide our people with the resources to get that done."
And find middle ground.
Step on the sidelines -- "I'm part of the team like everyone else," he said -- but not control them. Give his players support but insist that they exhibit strong character. "In the 60's it was, 'I'm O.K., you're O.K.,' and you felt like what people did on their own was their business," he said. "We're finding that's not the case. The player's private life is his private life, but all of them are very public people. I won't embarrass them. They won't embarrass the Texans, or somebody's leaving."
He supports the idea of teams' controlling more of their local marketing but said, "Maybe we will find that the league does a better job; we can always go back to that."
And check out his blunt view on the Texans' making money.
"If you don't make money you're only a partial success," he said. "Making money is a measure of efficiency. If you're not making money, you're not doing a good job -- even if you're winning Super Bowls."
He said his team should be competitive with the other 31 teams in three years, yet he is counting on some surprises.
His persona appears to be patient yet demanding. In the harsh, competitive climate he enters, can it last?
"The unique thing about sports is it builds camaraderie," McNair said. "Some of my old-time, best friends are guys I played ball with. You don't have that kind of camaraderie in regular business. And I love being around young people."
Here is a switch among N.F.L. owners: They genuinely like being around him.

HEADLINE: As the Drivers of the 18-Wheelers See It, the Economy Is on the Road to Recovery 

BYLINE:  By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: OKLAHOMA CITY, April 18 

 BODY:
Judging from the number of 18-wheelers rumbling in and out of the Flying J truck stop here on Interstate 40, the economy has left the recession in the dust. For a couple of weeks, a "Now Hiring" banner has been fluttering out front; business is up and the place needs two more cashiers and a midlevel manager.
 Drivers still balk at buying trinkets and gifts in the Flying J's store, and waitresses say drivers are still watching their tips. But they are buying more fuel, and few sit around anymore waiting for loads to fill their empty trailers. 
 "I don't have as much downtime," said Ron Jones, 40, stopping on his way to Lawton, Okla., for a shipment of Goodyear tires to haul to DeKalb, Ill. Danny Hamby, the stop's general manager, said, "I don't think we're in a rut anymore."
Economists and Wall Street analysts mix and mold all kinds of statistics -- on employment, inventories, industrial production, lending and borrowing, consumer and capital spending, imports and exports, profits and losses -- to assess the economy's pulse. A year after they declared the start of the recession, some have lately been drawing the economy's course in the shape of a "W," showing it slipping again after falling and bouncing a bit. Optimists see it scaling the valley of a "V." Pessimists are drawing an "L."
But truck drivers, who can offer what is perhaps a more tangible assessment of the economy, say they believe growth, at least in terms of the goods they carry, has begun inching up the eastern slope of a "U." 
"Around Christmas, I'd be ready to go, and they wouldn't have a load for me," Mr. Jones said, digging into a Flying J breakfast burrito as big as his foot. He was on his way to pick up a load of Goodyear tires, having just brought a shipment of automotive oil from Mississippi to Oklahoma City. "I could be sitting for six or seven days, and they wouldn't have a load for me. I don't sit much at all now." 
There is good reason to trust in the accuracy of the 18-wheel economy. "We haul the raw materials that products are made of," explained Don Weaver, 60, who was in the middle of a trip carrying cedar mulch from Paris, Tex., to Wichita. "We haul the product after it's finished."
According to the American Trucking Association, truck drivers carry 67 percent of the nation's domestic freight as measured by weight and 87 percent as measured by value. In weight, truck freight reached a peak in December 1999, the trucking association's chief economist, Bob Costello, said. It plunged 17 percent by July 2000, presaging the recession, and the events of Sept. 11 kept it down through last year. But by February, Mr. Costello said, traffic had climbed about 5 percent from the trough. 
That has also been the experience of David McCorkle, the association's chairman and owner of a truck company that runs 85 tractor-trailers. Mr. McCorkle said his trucks, which haul cement, gypsum, lime and sand for builders, factories and oil companies, were busy again after the post-Sept. 11 slowdown. For the industry, he said, "the prospects seem to be pretty good." 
Jim Baertschi, 54, detects all the signs of an incipient boom. He owns a Peterbilt truck, layered with polished chrome, and leases his services to the Allied Automotive Group, a car-hauling company. On this trip, he was taking four Chevrolet truck cabs and chassis to New Mexico. 
"I haul from the General Motors plant in Janesville, Wis.," Mr. Baertschi said, adding that he was one of 160 owner-operators normally leased to Allied. "For the last two years, we had 50 laid off. They've all been called back. In fact, they want to hire more."
A few Flying J customers have yet to feel much recovery. Gene Griffey, for example, went deep into debt to acquire eight trucks over the last decade. He hired drivers and started running the trucks from his home in Asheville, N.C. 
But Mr. Griffey, 52, is using just one truck now, and he is driving it himself. He lost a major customer, a window manufacturer in Texas that went bankrupt. Customers in the North Carolina furniture industry, crippled by the recession, shut down. 
"I'm working out of my yard now," he said. "I've sold five trucks. I still have three, and they're for sale. I laid the last driver off in January." 
Another owner-operator, Earl Gillespie, 50, said the investments in capital goods that he sees as a sign of recovery -- loads of assembly-line machinery, factory air-conditioning systems, I-beams -- had yet to appear. His loads have fallen 30 percent in less than a year. 
Steven Toth, 45, who forms a driving team with his wife, Debra, 48, has seen better times, too. As drivers for the U.S. Xpress Enterprises truck line, the Toths were carrying Compaq computers from Carson, Calif., to Indianapolis. 
They are getting some decent loads, allowing them together to earn $110,000 a year. But they are not back to normal. "In the late 90's we would normally run between 5,300 and 6,300 miles a week," Mr. Toth said. "Now it's a struggle to make 5,000."
Many drivers at the Flying J wondered about the fate of just-in-time delivery, the innovation that helped sustain the trucking boom in the 1990's. Rather than pack warehouses with goods that would be used in weeks or months, factories and store chains turned to trucks to deliver the goods when they needed them. 
The ability to provide this sort of service stalled after Sept. 11. Many companies had to halt production because the airplanes and ships that brought foreign components and materials ground to a halt. It was not long before the slowed-down trucking business slowed even further. 
But some drivers, like Ronald Doan of El Paso, are beginning to feel the just-in-time heat again. "I've got a load of plastic drinking cups I'm taking from Shreveport, La., and making three stops, the last one in Chino, Calif.," said Mr. Doan, 61. Each stop had to hit a warehouse early enough in the morning so that local distributors could then transfer the cups to restaurants in the area.
The deliveries are "nerve-racking," Mr. Doan said. But they also mean "we're getting busy."

HEADLINE: Police in Belarus Detain 40 As a Protest Ends Violently 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, April 20 

 BODY:
At least 40 demonstrators remained in a Minsk jail today, after truncheon-wielding police officers in Belarus on Friday violently broke up a downtown march protesting living conditions and inadequate salaries.
 At least 15 other protesters, most of them under age, were released overnight, said Andrei Sannikov, the leader of a Belarus human rights organization, Charter 97. Several protesters were reported hospitalized with injuries. 
 The Belarussian police said today that they had arrested about 85 protesters and released nearly 50.
Mr. Sannikov said the police action against what had been a peaceful march was meant to intimidate potential participants in what is usually Belarus's largest anti-government demonstration, an annual march marking the anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.
That protest is to be held next Friday. The 1986 explosion at the Chernobyl reactor, just across the Ukrainian border, left a fifth of Belarus contaminated by fallout.
The demonstrators' target is the government of President Aleksandr Lukashenko, Belarus's leader since 1994. His Communist-style government controls most aspects of Belarus's laggard economy and permits only limited political opposition.
Friday's demonstration was staged on Minsk's main avenue by several hundred protesters, some carrying the banned red-and-white flag that Belarus used in its first years after declaring independence from the Soviet Union.
The protesters marched under a banner that declared, "We can't live like this anymore." But some also carried signs accusing the government of providing illegal military assistance to Iraq, an allegation raised by American officials who visited Minsk in February.
Mr. Sannikov said the protest had been peaceful until several buses carrying black-helmeted riot police officers pulled alongside the marchers, and the police formed a line in front of them. "When the marchers met the first line of the special police force, they turned around and went back," Mr. Sannikov said, "and then they were beaten."
News agency reports said the protesters were hit with truncheons as they sat in the street and on sidewalks, then herded to jail.
The Charter 97 Web site, www.charter97.org, stated that six protesters were hospitalized with head injuries. News reports said one was in serious condition.
Among those arrested were a prominent Belarussian filmmaker, Yuri Khaschevatsky. One of the organizers of the march, a 60-year-old journalist named Valery Shchukin, was beaten unconscious, according to the Charter 97 Web site. 
The police said that Mr. Shchukin suffered injuries to his lower back and pelvis.
Mr. Lukashenko has long been ostracized by most Western governments because of his government's human rights record. Two of Mr. Lukashenko's leading political opponents have vanished in recent years, and a former member of Belarus's special services charged late last year that one had been executed and buried near a government base.
Belarus has met the criticism with growing irritation. On Monday, the government threw out the leader of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, a principal human rights monitor, and refused a diplomatic visa to his successor.

HEADLINE: Many Made the Move From the Industry to the Administration 

BYLINE:  By DON VAN NATTA Jr. with NEELA BANERJEE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 20 

 BODY:
Crucial White House positions and the upper ranks of several agencies, including the Interior Department and the Environmental Protection Agency, are held by appointees who, for years, worked in the energy industry, lobbied for it or defended its interests in the nation's courts.
 The better known are the most visible: Secretary of Commerce Donald L. Evans, for example, who for 25 years worked for Tom Brown Inc., a Denver oil and gas company, and Andrew H. Card Jr., the White House chief of staff, who as president of the American Automobile Manufacturers Association lobbied against improving fuel efficiency and emission standards. Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton received $285,630 from the energy and natural resources industries when she ran for the Senate in Colorado in 1996. 
 Energy industry alumni and supporters also hold less visible jobs in the administration and agencies that allow them to make far-reaching policy and regulatory changes. 
Philip Cooney is the chief of staff for the Council on Environmental Quality, a White House advisory group that develops policies on environmental and economic issues. The council has played a crucial role in forming a White House policy that played down the effect of carbon dioxide emissions on global warming. Earlier, Mr. Cooney was a lawyer for the American Petroleum Institute, the main lobbying arm of the oil industry, and was a prominent critic of global warming theories.
James E. Cason holds a new high-level position in the Interior Department, associate deputy secretary. He was an assistant interior secretary under James A. Watt in the Reagan era and, critics say, tried to stop limits on drilling for oil and gas in national forests. The Interior Department denied that, underscoring instead Mr. Cason's recent tenure at a company that specializes in manufacturing energy-saving insulation.
As deputy secretary of the interior, the second in command at the department, J. Steven Griles oversees more than 500 million acres of federally protected land. Mr. Griles was the assistant secretary at the department from 1984 to 1989. He left the government to work for the mining industry, most recently with National Environmental Strategies, a Washington firm that represents the National Mining Association and utilities that use a lot of coal.
In March 2001, the spokesman for the National Mining Association at the time, John Grasser, called Mr. Griles "an ally to the industry."
Mark Pfeifle, an Interior Department spokesman, noted that Mr. Griles worked with Democrats in the 1980's to close loopholes that allowed the coal industry to pollute heavily. He also said Mr. Griles's firm represented Caithness Energy, which specializes in renewable energy.
The number of people in the Interior Department who once worked in the energy industry is only a small slice of a much larger picture, said Mr. Pfeifle, who added that other officials had experience on the state level working "with local citizens to find compromise and consensus."
He added, "The real hands on deck are ready to implement what the secretary calls the four C's: communication, cooperation, consultation -- all in the service of conservation."
John. D. Graham is the administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs at the Office of Management and Budget, a powerful department that advises the president on regulatory change, particularly on environmental and public health issues. Mr. Graham is the founding director of the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis, a nonprofit organization financed by some of the country's largest energy and chemical companies, including ExxonMobil and Dow Chemical. The center's benefactors include the nation's biggest producers of dioxins, a substance widely thought to be carcinogenic, environmental groups said.
Senior White House officials argued that the backgrounds of some of the top staff members matter much less than the policies they develop. 
"Look at the agenda, and look at the result of the policy," said Scott McClellan, deputy White House press secretary. "Any independent look at the president's agenda underscores his commitment to achieving results for the American people."

HEADLINE: Sports of The Times; 
Justice Byron White: A Friend and a Mentor

BYLINE:  By IRA BERKOW 

 BODY:
Nick Lowery was having a tough time of it. He had been a fine place-kicker in college, at Dartmouth, and expected a career booting balls in the National Football League. 
 Not so quick. Lowery was cut 11 times from eight N.F.L. teams before catching on with the Kansas City Chiefs in 1980. He beat out, of all people, Jan Stenerud, who to this day is the only place-kicker in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. 
 And things hardly got better for Lowery in his first training camp with the Chiefs. He was the butt of numerous pranks; he was not only a rookie but a rookie from the Ivy League, which carried with it a special kind of contempt in that bruising environment. One evening in training camp, for example, he found fresh cow manure in his bed.
He tried to talk to his new teammates, to be one of the guys, but he encountered resistance. Shortly after that, he went home to McLean, Va., and sought out his next-door neighbor on Hampshire Road, who had become a friend and mentor.
The neighbor was Justice Byron R. White of the United States Supreme Court. White had also been a football player, a 6-foot-1, 195-pound all-purpose all-American back at Colorado. He picked up the nickname Whizzer while leading the nation in rushing, in scoring and in total offense. He was also a star basketball player, and led Colorado to a National Invitation Tournament final at Madison Square Garden. And he was a standout baseball player and the valedictorian of his graduating class.
He went to Yale Law School and to Oxford as a Rhodes scholar. In between he played football for one season with the Pittsburgh Pirates (later the Steelers), in 1938, and two seasons with the Detroit Lions, in 1939 and 1940. He led the N.F.L. in rushing in 1938 and 1940. Then he joined the Navy and went off to fight in World War II.
So not only did Justice White know something of the athletic world, he knew something of the world.
"Nick," Lowery said White told him, his strong bearing carrying a sense of gentle strength, "the only way you are going to get respect from those fellows is not by anything you say, but what you can deliver, how you perform on the field."
 It was a simple piece of advice, but when you are foundering, when emotions cloud your perspective, it is such advice, and coming from someone like Justice White, that will make an impact. It did make one on Nick Lowery.
That and other thoughts about Justice White came back to Lowery upon learning of the death Monday of his neighbor of 40 years. White, who served 31 years on the Supreme Court, was 84.
Lowery recalled the first full year he spent with Kansas City. He had a string of 11 field goals in 12 attempts, then kicked a game-winning field goal against the Lions. The guys who had been most vicious in riding him hugged him with tears in their eyes, he recalled.
"It was exactly what Justice White had been talking about," Lowery said.
Lowery said Justice White was reluctant to talk about his athletic career -- "He would always change the subject" -- and was perhaps happiest discussing history and people like Abraham Lincoln and Chief Justice John Marshall.
"I was curious to see what kind of football player he was," Lowery said, "and I was able to get a film of a game he played against Utah, my father's alma mater. It was amazing. There was this one kickoff return in which he almost ran backward in the end zone, then cut straight upfield -- he cut like a knife -- and broke about three tackles and completely faked out four or five other players and raced in for a touchdown. He was so fast, it looked like the other players were moving in slow motion."
He remembers Justice White talking about Bill Bradley a few years after Bradley became a senator. He said he admired Bradley because it was important to have balance in life, and not enough athletes do. Bradley had achieved balance as a student and an athlete, and he taught English in a Harlem school before getting involved in public service in government.
Lowery, now 45 and retired from football since 1997 after a superb 17-year career that included seasons with the Jets and the Patriots, has taken that advice from White to heart, too. He is a research fellow at the Harvard Project on American Indian Economic Development, and the first professional athlete to graduate from the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard.
On occasion, Lowery saw glimpses of the competitiveness that made White such a great athlete. About 1977 Lowery was playing basketball in the driveway with his two brothers -- all of the Lowerys are over 6 feet -- and White's daughter, Nancy, who was a field hockey star at Stanford.
"Justice White came by and we asked him to play," Lowery said. "He said O.K. He took off his tie and rolled up the sleeves of his white shirt and played in his black dress shoes. He was about 60 years old. We played for over an hour, the justice and me against the three of them. He was tough, and we killed 'em. But we all had fun. The next morning I saw Justice White go to his car on crutches.
"I went over to him. What happened? He said, 'Oh, I hurt my feet a little bit, but I'll be all right.' And he was. A few days later I saw him out in his yard mowing his lawn in his shorts."

HEADLINE: PRO BASKETBALL: INSIDE THE N.B.A.; 
Stunned by Their Swoon, Bucks Look Inward

BYLINE:  By MIKE WISE 

 BODY:
George Karl blamed himself for one of the worst collapses in N.B.A. history. Anthony Mason grumbled for many months about not getting the ball inside, but even Mason, the team's prized off-season acquisition, acknowledged last week: "Maybe it's me. I'm the new guy and I haven't fit in." 
 Ernie Grunfeld, the general manager, preached calm amid the storm swirling around the moribund and lottery-bound Milwaukee Bucks. 
 "We're going to look for ways to improve, but probably right now is not the best time to evaluate where we are," Grunfeld said in a telephone interview on Friday, two days after the Bucks failed to qualify for the playoffs. 
One Eastern Conference official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said last week that he would not be surprised if the Bucks and the Knicks began talking about a trade in the next few weeks. Any deal would probably not be completed until after the draft in June, especially if the Knicks meet some of their big-man needs in the lottery.
Grunfeld shot down the notion that any of Milwaukee's key players -- Ray Allen, Glenn Robinson and Sam Cassell -- would be a part of a deal involving the Knicks.
"Nobody is on the block," Grunfeld said. "Would it be conceivable that we would speak? Yes, of course. But that would be irresponsible to throw names out there right now."
If anything ever did come of a conversation between the clubs, the Bucks would most likely be more interested in Latrell Sprewell, who is from Milwaukee, and Marcus Camby, whom Grunfeld has always liked, instead of Allan Houston. In return, the Knicks would want Allen.
Whether or not a deal is struck, two teams with two of the top five payrolls in pro basketball -- teams that were supposed to make the playoffs -- will soon shake up their rosters.
The Bucks' free fall the last two months of the season was more devastating than the dismal 30-52 season by the Knicks, if for no other reason than Milwaukee was among the favorites to win the Eastern Conference. Only two months ago, the Bucks were on top of the Central Division. They then lost 17 of 23 games, including their last 12 on the road.
On the last night of the regular season, in a game they needed to win to get in, the Bucks were routed by Detroit, 123-89.
"I think it falls on me for changing the formula and trying to get it fitted," Karl said last week.
With $14 million coming to him the next two years through a contract extension, Karl is staying put.
As for Allen, Cassell and Robinson, they have a much greater chance of moving to another team, though Grunfeld does not seem publicly committed to shaking up the roster.
"We had a lot of injuries in the second half of the season to four of our top five guys," he said. "We lost six overtime games after Jan. 1, and that affected our confidence. There were a lot of reasons. We had high expectations, but the bottom line is, we didn't get it done."
Like Sprewell, Camby and Houston, the Bucks stars' hopes of meshing, staying healthy and playing for a title faded in two short months.
The Bucks seemed such a sure-fire bet to make a run, Allen was included in a television playoff promotion. In a recent commercial, he is shown with the Lawrence O'Brien championship trophy, with other All-Stars on playoff-bound teams.
Allen probably never figured that was as close to the playoffs as he would come this season.

Speculation Over Brown
When the Philadelphia 76ers visited Denver in late December, Larry Brown casually said how much he enjoyed his time in Denver and how nice it would be to finish his career there.
The way Brown has moved around in his coaching career, the rumor mill began to churn. Last week it went into overdrive. Two general managers said they had heard that Brown was headed to Denver, where he would be joined by Bob Hill, his former Kansas assistant, who is now the Fordham coach. Brown would coach under the eye of his former student at U.C.L.A., Nuggets General Manager Kiki Vandeweghe. 
The general managers also said they had heard that Kentucky Coach Tubby Smith would succeed Brown as the 76ers' coach. 
Out of left field, right? 
"Larry Brown is our coach," Billy King, the 76ers' general manager, said Friday from Philadelphia. "I don't want to get into speculation. He hasn't given me any indication he's leaving."
A Nuggets official said there had not been one substantive conversation between the team and Brown regarding a move to Denver, where the interim coach, Mike Evans, is without a contract.
Brown has reiterated several times that if he is healthy, he will continue coaching. And that if he coaches anywhere in the N.B.A. next season, it will be in Philadelphia.
"I've been with Larry for nine years and I always hear the same rumors coming up," King said. "I guess if you keep writing it, after a while people will think it's true."
The speculation keeps arising because Brown is the Kevin Bacon of the N.B.A, within six degrees of any job because of his extensive travels. On paper, the Nuggets look like his typical rebuilding project: a young team looking for leadership and direction from an old-school teacher. Throw in that Brown looks perpetually worn down by Allen Iverson's inability to grasp his role as an off-the-floor leader, and it begins to make sense. Smith's leaving Kentucky is not even that preposterous, even with a recent contract extension.
But Hill, the former N.B.A. coach, has seven years left on his contract with Fordham.
"That's been out there for a while," Hill said Friday. "It resurfaced a couple of days ago. I haven't talked to any N.B.A. teams. There's nothing to it. Makes for a good rumor, though."

Webber Wanted to Be a Knick
From the Now-It-Can-Be-Told File: Chris Webber is happy with the way things worked out. But last June he wanted to play in New York. Allan Houston's $100 million deal all but secured his staying in Sacramento, Webber said recently.
Webber said his desire to go to the Knicks was not just because he wanted to play with Latrell Sprewell again. He said the uncertainty in the Kings' organization at the time (Sacramento had just traded Webber's friend and teammate Jason Williams for Mike Bibby), coupled with watching the draft in New York, swayed him.
"Draft night was the weirdest night," he said. "I saw us get Gerald Wallace, and I didn't know who Gerald was. I called Jason and he said: 'Oh, he can play. I'll call you right back.' He called me right back and said, 'I've been traded.' I'm like, 'What?' 
"So at this point, I'm in New York, guys at the draft are chanting my name, holding up signs. We're in the room, me and my friends, just laughing. New York sent me a miniature Madison Square Garden replica, where you take the lid off and see everything inside. My father went crazy. I really thought I had a chance.
"I loved the way New York embraced Spree after everything. Then I thought, there's not many real power forwards in the East. I could play center and let Camby play the power forward. I was very serious. At that time, that's what I wanted.
"But when they signed Allan, it kind of numbed me. I knew there was no way."
Houston's contract meant there was no way the Knicks would dangle Houston in front of Sacramento as part of a deal for Webber. The Knicks would also have had to give up Camby and perhaps another player. And the biggest part of the package, Houston, would have had to agree to play in Sacramento -- a long shot.
Still, Webber had already worked out a handshake agreement with Rob Pelinka, his former Michigan teammate and an agent for SFX. Pelinka, he said, would have advised him in the event of a trade from Sacramento.
"In no way am I trying to point the finger at Allan, because I saw him the other day and I felt kind of funny," Webber said. "It was just economics."
As it is, Webber gets to play with Peja Stojakovic, the All-Star swingman, on a team that won 61 games. 
"Allan is a great player," Webber added. "I wanted to play with both of them. That would have been like having two Pejas out there. But if I was Sacramento, I wouldn't sign and trade me to New York. I just looked at the common sense of it. Looking back, I'm glad things worked out the way they did."

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON and STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 20 

 BODY:
The seven big industrial nations today endorsed a new approach to dealing with financial problems in developing countries, saying they would work together to make it easier for governments in dire economic straits to repay debts more slowly.
 The initiative was the most concrete to emerge from two days of meetings here among finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of 7 nations. It could produce some of the most fundamental changes in international finance since the Asian financial crisis of 1998 rocked the global economy. 
 The officials from the seven countries -- the United States, Japan, Britain, France, Italy, Germany and Canada -- met as their counterparts from 175 other nations gathered at the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to plan for financial stability and economic growth.
There was some tension among the officials here. Although they discussed the topic only glancingly in their official meetings, the United States and the European Union remained at odds over the Bush administration's recent decision to impose tariffs on imported steel. After the Group of 7 finished meeting, European Union officials in Brussels retaliated by formally proposing duties of up to 100 percent on a range of American goods, including citrus and textiles.
"It would become a very severe burden for the world economic recovery if it came to what we all don't want to happen -- a trade war between the United States and Europe," Hans Eichel, the German finance minister, said in Washington, Reuters reported.
In a statement, the Group of 7 officials said they would continue to work to cut the flow of money to groups believed responsible for terrorism.
The group met with Jorge Remes Lenicov, the finance minister of Argentina but did not agree on an aid package for the country. The monetary fund wants deeper budget cuts and more sweeping reforms than Argentinian officials are willing to make at this point.
Any package of aid "needs to be built on a sustainable approach to the issues," said Horst Kohler, managing director of the fund. Mr. Remes will convey the fund's wishes to the Argentinian government and the fund plans to send its own officials to Buenos Aires, Mr. Kohler said.
The group, which effectively sets policy for both the monetary fund and the World Bank, remained divided on a number of issues. Among them is a proposal by Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill to have the World Bank provide as much as half of its aid to poor nations in the form of outright grants rather than loans. Many European governments fear such an approach could lead to cutbacks in the amount of aid that rich nations make available.
But the group reached a compromise on how to develop a better system for helping the governments of developing countries when they run into financial trouble and cannot make their debt payments. Under current practice, poor nations have great difficulty working out agreements for new repayment schedules with the investors who purchase their bonds because such agreements effectively require unanimous backing of the bondholders.
The other six nations agreed today to accept an American proposal under which new debt issued by developing nations would include contractual agreements with investors allowing a smaller proportion of bondholders to agree on new repayment terms. The United States argues that such problems are best worked out in the marketplace between investors and governments.

HEADLINE: MIDEAST TURMOIL: THE DEMONSTRATORS; 
Thousands March in Washington in Support of Palestinians

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 20 

 BODY:
Tens of thousands of Arab-Americans blended with demonstrators against the military campaign in Afghanistan and those criticizing international financial institutions during protests today in Washington, with the cause of the Palestinians and criticism of Israel turning into the main message of the multifaceted crowd.
 The protest was as peaceful as it was pained, with many families arriving with their young children to spend the day urging American policy not to support Israel's actions in the West Bank. On Monday, a large rally in support of Israel had taken up the same space on Washington's spacious Mall. 
 "My sister has been trapped in the Church of the Nativity for more than two weeks now," said Issa Danho, a 44-year-old construction worker from Alexandria, Va. "It is a holy place. They thought they would be safe there."
Mr. Danho said he had not talked to his sister, Diana, since she entered the church because there is no electricity to charge her cell phone. He said he had wanted to speak rationally about American foreign policy but that it was hard not to lapse into emotionalism.
"If this president, with his limited vocabulary, says Sharon is a man of peace, then Napoleon was a man of peace," he said. "There is black and white in the country right now because of September 11, but the Palestinian issue is not black and white. It is a hopeless time and, I'll be honest, I have no answer."
Thousands of police were in the streets, many of which were closed.
Those who marched against globalization seemed largely sympathetic to those marching for peace or in support of the Palestinians. Organizers said it was the biggest rally ever here in support of the Palestinian cause. Though the causes represented here today were disparate and disjointed, many protesters appeared to lump them together.
"The airlines have taken advantage of the September 11 attacks to attack the labor movement," said Rodney Ward, an unemployed flight attendant, listing a variety of reasons he had come to town. . "It certainly doesn't help to be humiliating the Palestinians, and the war in Afghanistan only breeds more terrorism. It's important for citizens to speak up. That's part of being a patriot."

HEADLINE: EXTENDED DROUGHT STRAINS RESOURCES ALONG EAST COAST 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
The potent drought that has parched much of the East since last fall has communities from Maryland to Maine facing limits on new construction, higher water charges, restrictions on water use, and the prospect of many more dry months without relief.
 If the drought drags on, possible delays in linking new housing or businesses to overburdened water systems could cause economic setbacks, water experts said. For the moment, no one has tallied the impacts, which are usually felt community by community, well by well. 
 Many water systems, including those in Frederick, Md.; Greensboro, N.C.; and many towns near Boston and around New Jersey, were straining to meet demand even before the dry spell settled in.
Increasingly, state and local rules require that developers show there is adequate water before new housing is built. In many places where growth has outstripped supplies, that is becoming a significant hurdle. 
It is unlikely that relief will come soon. Federal meteorologists say there is less than an 8 percent chance that rainfall from now through July will end the drought in coastal Maine and Connecticut, Long Island, New York City, New Jersey, eastern Pennsylvania, northern Maryland, South Carolina and Georgia.
In many other dry regions, the chance that the drought will end this summer is only slightly higher, according to the predictions by the National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, N.C.
But those predictions presume that conditions over the next few months will be typical for the time of year. Lately, nothing about the weather has been typical. Flow gauges in streams up and down the East Coast show record lows day after day.
Even scattered downpours like the ones that drenched parts of the East on Friday offer little relief.
The potential for damage to the economy is considerable. Vegetable and milk prices will rise as produce dwindles from farms in the Northeast. Restrictions on water use could hurt small businesses, forcing car washes, for example, to cut back their hours, or machine tool shops, which are often big users of water as a coolant, to reduce production, or causing well drillers to dig deeper for water, at higher cost. Some tourists might alter their vacations, avoiding the Northeast and its hotels.
So far, the economic damage has only been spotty and minor. Mike Saulle, owner of the Centre Ridge Nursery in Nutley, N.J., said yesterday that fewer landscapers were placing large orders for shrubs and trees. The New York State Restaurant Association said some restaurants were offering bottled water at half price and not serving tap water unless customers asked for it. The Philadelphia Suburban Corporation, a water company, reported that restrictions on water use had contributed to a slight decline in earnings.
Because of water restrictions, marinas on the Rockland County banks of the Hudson River have stopped offering boat-washing services to yacht owners, losing a significant source of revenue, employees said.
The drought in the Northeast, if it endures, would show up first in the national economic statistics as a rise in the Consumer Price Index, economists say. The increase in this inflation gauge would not be significant because most of the nation's food is grown elsewhere, they contend, but any increase in inflation just as the economy is recovering from recession could make Wall Street investors extra jittery about interest rates. 
"Think of the drought as a supply shock," said Richard Berner, an economist and forecaster at Morgan Stanley. He said the shock from this drought has not yet been sufficient to be noticeable in food prices or food quality. Early summer corn could be the first test of the drought's impact on prices.
Like other economists, Mr. Berner has not yet included the drought or its potential for damage in his forecasts, which currently predict a steady and healthy recovery from recession. If anything, the dry and unseasonably warm weather in the first quarter encouraged more than normal home construction, helping to lift the economy. 
"I am factoring in the drought as a potential risk," Mr. Berner said, "but not a problem yet."
The last year eastern states were poised to enter summer with such a deficit of rain was 1966, said Jay Lawrimore, the director of climate monitoring at the data center in Asheville. Many areas are more than a foot below their normal precipitation totals, including New York City and much of New Jersey.
"Things are not looking good," Mr. Lawrimore said.
In 1966, the northeastern drought became so bad that the mayor of York, Pa., John L. Snyder, offered $350 of his own savings to a professional rainmaker, according to local newspaper archives. Now York County is in its fifth severe drought in the last seven years.
But the effects, should the current drought persist, are likely to be far greater than they were 36 years ago because population, the economy and water use have grown sharply since then, particularly in the suburbs.
The increased demand is putting ever more strain on water systems, be they a municipal reservoir serving expanding suburbs or a private well serving an enlarged house with more bathrooms and lawn sprinklers. 
Add a prolonged drought to the effects of prosperity and rising populations, and problems are inevitable, including higher costs.
"Usually, a utility will institute a reverse price structure so the more water you use, the more you pay per unit, to accomplish some measure of conservation," said Bill Lauer, a water engineer at the American Water Works Association, a Denver trade group representing 57,000 private and public water suppliers.
He said the West was used to chronic water limits. "We've had these restrictions so often it's become a way of life," Mr. Lauer said. But for the East, he said, this is something new.
The prospect of serious, costly shortages is what led New Jersey, Maryland, New York City and other places to institute the first water restrictions long before largely unused snow shovels were stashed away. 
Now, central Maryland, New Jersey, New York City, eastern Pennsylvania and many other communities have moved to drought emergencies, with mandatory restrictions and fines for infractions in most of these places.
The abrupt, record-setting heat wave that last week had the Middle West and the East feeling like August in April made matters worse, not only by evaporating precious groundwater, but also by stirring trees, shrubs and grass into early explosive growth, pulling yet more water from the soil. 
Meteorologists define a heat wave as three consecutive days with temperatures reaching 90 degrees or higher, and that is exactly what struck New York City and the surrounding region Tuesday until Thursday, only the second time in a century that a heat wave occurred in April. The last one was in 1976.
"Everything leafed out quickly because of the heat," said David Reynolds, a senior meteorologist for the National Weather Service. With the ground already bereft of moisture after a largely snowless winter and a dry fall, the demand from fast-growing vegetation creates further drying just as the hottest months approach, he said. 
"All those trees are sucking up whatever moisture is available, so whatever rain falls has much less effect," Mr. Reynolds said. "It'd have to rain a quarter-inch a day just to counterbalance what's going back up into space through evaporation."
In many places affected by the drought, there is a sense of disquiet, linked to the idea that humans are witnessing not only natural vagaries, but deeper shifts in longstanding climate patterns.
It remains far too soon to conclude with statistical certainty that the regional perturbations in weather patterns are the result of a global warming trend that scientists say is being influenced by humans. But whatever is causing the changes, many people seem to have lost their faith in the seasons. 
In the Hudson Valley north of New York City, the drought has been less severe than in some places. Enough showers have fallen to swell lilac buds and burst forsythia into yellow floral fireworks. 
But even there, water problems are growing, and the storms are never quite enough.
Last Wednesday, on the stifling night after the temperature in Central Park reached 96 degrees, restless residents up and down the valley stirred to the sound of approaching thunder.
For most, though, the rumbling rolled closer, distant lightning flashed, trees rustled in a rising breeze -- and then nothing. Nary a raindrop. 
Thunderstorms did spottily soak places Friday night, and cooler, more typical temperatures returned to the region yesterday.
But no one was counting on the return of the rains.
In Hopewell Junction, N.Y., on the receding rural fringe 56 miles north of Manhattan, William G. Jordan, 50, saw the well in his backyard run dry last week and had to call in a drilling crew. The wells for three other houses on his road failed recently, he said.
His house and the others had been built on farmland 25 years ago, with shallow wells drawing on plentiful water stored in gravel beds just 40 or 50 feet down.
But more and more developments were built, with wells sucking more water. With no rain to replenish the supply, his pump whirred but pulled nothing. Off and on, "there was barely enough to flush the toilets and brush your teeth," Mr. Jordan said.
On Friday afternoon, Dan Boyd's 45-foot-tall drilling rig was parked behind Mr. Jordan's white split-level, cutting slowly into the bedrock below, going 200 feet or more, until it hit flowing water. 
Mr. Boyd said he was very busy these days, like many other drillers, facing a backlog of weeks of work from Lake Placid to Brooklyn.
Mr. Jordan said the new well would cost $5,000 to $10,000, depending on how deep the driller had to dig. The harsh reality of dry times, for him, was no longer just a brown lawn.
He said he would never take water for granted again. "If you got it, you're lucky," he said. "If you can, conserve it, because when you don't have it, it's trouble."
As Mr. Boyd and his assistant monitored the slow descent of the spinning drill, more anvil clouds rolled in from the west, ushering in the weekend cool front. 
The pewter clouds rumbled to the south and north, flecked by lightning, but the dusty grass around the chattering drill remained dry.

Temps Are the First to Feel a Downturn

BYLINE:  By Leslie Eaton 

 BODY:
LISA MENDES is well-spoken, well-dressed, well-organized - and pain-fully well-versed in New York City's economic woes. That's because Ms. Mendes, 32, supports herself and her 5-year-old son by working as a temp, temporary clerical worker.
 But now there is no temp work, and there hasn't been for months. And Ms. Mendes says she is becoming desperate. 
 She is not alone. Temporary workers are the canaries in the economic coal mines, the ones who feel it first when the economy crumbles.
 "In a downturn, the first thing companies get rid of is discretionary expenses," said James A. Essey, president of the TemPositions Group of Companies. In this particular downturn, office temps have been especially hard hit, he said, with business at some firms down 35 percent or more.
 Temp employment grew rapidly and steadily throughout the 1990's. But last spring, when the economy began to cool, jobs held through temp agencies quickly plunged by more than 13,000, or 14.5 percent, according to data from the New York State Department of Labor.
 It will be a while before the state collects statistics that show exactly what has happened since last June, but given the recession and the aftermath of Sept. 11, the omens are not good. Employment in the broad category of business service, which includes temp agencies, fell by about 23,000 from June 2001 to March 2002, the Labor Department reported last week.
 Historically, temp jobs are also early indicators of economic recovery. Temp poisitions soar as business begins to pick up, because companies are reluctant to add permanent staff before they are sure the economy will remain strong.
 But New York temp agencies say there is still no surge in sight. "There is not sign of a pick-up right today," said Cliff Stuart, who runs Madison Avenue Temporary Service. "My guess is that we still have several more months to go."
 This is bad news for people like Ms. Mendes, who has been out of work since October. She started tempting in 2000, and when one temporary assignment as an inventory clerk ended on Friday, she had a job in accounts payable the following Monday, she said. "All of a sudden, now there's nothing."
 She insists this is not for lack of trying. "I've been to so many agencies it's unbelievable," she said. "I've actually lost track." She has gone through a program run by the Consortium for Worker Education to assist those who lost their jobs after Sept. 11, and has attended job training sessions. She passed all her skills tests with flying colors, she said, but there just doesn't seem to be much call for workers like her.
 And there is a lot of competition. It used to be that if a temp agency sent her to a job, she started to work, Ms. Mendes said; but at her last referral, two weeks ago, the boss said they were planning to interview three or four temps before choosing one.
 She had hopes of another job, a $35,000-a-year position as an administrative assistant, but was told she needed a college degree.
 "I could kick myself," she said. But in Jamaica, where she grew up, "college was not pushed," Ms. Mendes said. And because she was orphaned at age 6, "I didn't have anyone to push me," she added. "Anything I've done, I've done because of me."
 Starting in January, Ms. Mendes became a college student, attending Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn two nights a week until after 10 and on Saturdays. The school has a day care center with cots that her son, Nicholas, could sleep on, but he doesn't.
 "He is just chipper, bouncing and bouncing," she said. "But when he gets up in the morning to go to school, he's really tired. We're both really tired."
During the day, Ms. Mendes looks for work. She is still receiving unemployment insurance payments, but she said the $218.70 a week she receives after taxes barely covers her costs. Because Ms. Mendes gets food stamps, Nicholas has enough to eat, she said, "but there are certain things he wants that I can't give him." Summer clothes, for example.
 She rents a bedroom in an apartment she shares in Crown Heights; she does not have use of the living room, so she sits in the dark until Nicholas goes to sleep and she can turn on a light and do her homework.
 Ms. Mendes is determined to succeed. "Every month, I'm like, 'Something is going to happen to the economy,' " she said. But so far, that something hasn't been good.

Borrower Beware: Credit Scorers Are Watching

BYLINE:  By BETH KOBLINER

 BODY:
WHEN Kimberly Ammons, an accountant in Brighton, Colo., first applied for a home mortgage last year with her husband, Aaron, an electrical engineer, she was surprised to learn that they probably would not qualify for the lowest available interest rate. 
 Their mortgage broker, she said, had informed her that she had a lower-than-average credit score -- a snapshot of her creditworthiness -- partly because her credit report listed many charge accounts in her married and maiden names. But eight of the accounts, she said, actually belonged to her mother, Kim Matsunaga of Berthoud, Colo. Once the report was corrected, her credit score rose. She and her husband signed a 30-year mortgage last December, at a 6.75 percent fixed rate, among the lowest available at the time. 
 "I don't think we would have been able to qualify for as good a rate without fixing our score," Mrs. Ammons, 26, said. 
The Ammonses, along with many other borrowers, have found that credit scores can have a substantial impact on one's financial life. Lenders routinely use them to determine rates, fees and other loan terms. Usually, the higher the score, the better the deal, which can mean lower monthly payments and other savings.
"With the traditional home-buying season upon us, it is vitally important to make sure your credit score is as high as it can be," said Keith T. Gumbinger, a vice president of HSH Associates, a mortgage research firm in Butler, N.J.
Since last spring, consumers have been able to gain access to credit scores called FICO scores, developed by Fair, Isaac & Company, the San Rafael, Calif., concern that pioneered the practice and now dominates the field. After intense public pressure, the company agreed to make individual scores available; it made an arrangement with Equifax, one of the major credit-reporting agencies, to provide them as part of a credit profile package for $12.95. Information is available at www.myfico.com. (Most people will still find the system a bit of a mystery, because the company will not reveal its formula, but at least they will know what the score is.)
Other scores are available -- all major credit-reporting agencies, for example, have concocted systems, with different point ranges. They are happy to share them with consumers, for a fee, to provide a sort of a barometer of creditworthiness, but they give only the FICO scores to lenders.
EVEN if you're not looking for a new home, it is important to know your credit score, financial advisers say, because it is used by more and more companies, including credit card issuers, auto lenders and, now, insurers. A survey last summer by Conning & Company, an insurance consultant, found that 92 percent of large auto insurers nationwide used scores based on credit data to determine what to charge customers or whether to offer coverage. The practice became common three years ago.
"We're hearing from people who say, 'I've been a customer for 20 years and now I'm paying more' or 'I've been canceled, because some actuary thinks I'm likely to have more accidents because of my credit score,' " said Joel Ario, the state insurance administrator in Oregon, which is among 13 states that have passed laws restricting the use of credit scores by insurers.
Insurers and lenders say credit scores are essential tools for assessing a customer's potential risk, allowing them to price loans and policies more fairly.
Craig Watts, a Fair, Isaac spokesman, said the FICO score was never meant to be the sole criterion for evaluating customers. "We created these scores for lenders and insurers to use as a tool but not a replacement for other underwriting criteria," he said.
But many lenders say they wield enormous power. "Thanks to technology, that single piece of data becomes a fast and easy way to judge someone," said Chris Larsen, chief executive of the online lender E-Loan.
Fair, Isaac developed the FICO scores in 1989, as a way to condense a consumer's entire credit history into a single figure. The data from a consumer's credit report is plugged into an undisclosed formula, resulting in a score of 300 to 850. (The median score, according to Fair, Isaac, is 720.) Insurers receive a variation of the FICO score, sometimes known as an insurance score, which is not available to the public.
Home and auto insurers contend that they have found a correlation between low credit scores and customer risk; they also say that credit scoring can benefit consumers. The Progressive Casualty Insurance Company, for example, said that 63 percent of its policyholders paid lower premiums than they would have without credit scoring.
But critics worry that using credit scores to screen insurance candidates may be unfair to some people who have not established much of a credit record. Consumer groups, and even some insurance agents, have also raised concerns that some people were being turned down or charged higher rates without adequate explanation. 
Jeff Stiling, a sales executive at a technology company in Portland, Ore., said he has not had an accident, filed a claim or missed a payment in the two years that he has held an auto insurance policy with the American Home Assurance Company. But in September, he said, he was notified that his automobile premium was rising 30 percent. He said he was told the adjustment was partly because of a statewide increase and partly because of his credit score. 
"It was a big surprise, since my credit is about as perfect as it can be," said Mr. Stiling, 41, who lives in Beaverton.
At the suggestion of his insurer, Mr. Stiling obtained a copy of his credit score from the TransUnion service and learned that it was 893 out of a possible 934. The insurer's decision still baffles him, he said.
Ned Burke, a spokesman for American Home Assurance, with is a unit of the American International Group, said he could not comment on Mr. Stiling's situation.
While there are no guarantees, in most cases a good credit score should lead to lower interest rates or insurance premiums. So how can consumers raise their scores?
The first step is to ensure that credit reports are accurate. A 1998 study by the Public Interest Research Group, a consumer advocacy organization, found that about one in three reports had serious errors.
Consumers can buy their full reports for $9 each from Equifax, TransUnion and Experian. (They are free to residents of six states, including New Jersey, and to people who have been denied credit.) TransUnion includes its own version of a credit score free with its report; Experian charges an additional $3.95 for its non-FICO version, adding up to the same fee that Equifax charges. (E-Loan offers visitors to its Web site, www.eloan.com, its own free credit score.)
After correcting obvious mistakes, consumers may have trouble improving a credit score because the computations remain a tightly guarded secret.
Fair, Isaac does reveal that the most important factor in a credit score is the ability to make timely payments, which accounts for about 35 percent of the score, followed by total debt load, which accounts for about 30 percent.
But paying bills in full each month may not increase your score as much as you might think; information in the reports may not always be up to date because of quirks in the reporting system. Industry experts say that closing unused accounts will not help a credit score, and may even lower it. One factor in calculating a score is the ratio between total debt and available credit, they say, and closing accounts reduces your available credit, making your debt appear closer to the maximum allowed.
NOT using your cards does not look good, either. Fair, Isaac gives lenders a list of reasons for low scores; they include "no recent revolving balances," "too few accounts with balances," as well as "too many accounts recently opened" and "too many accounts with balances." 
What is the ideal number of credit accounts, and how often should consumers use them? Mr. Watts, the Fair, Isaac spokesman, says it is important to keep credit-card account balances below 50 percent of the credit limit. Richard F. Le Febvre, president of the AAA American Credit Bureau and a credit-scoring expert who has testified on behalf of consumers against insurance companies and lenders, says credit histories look best when the consumer has three credit cards and keeps balances below one-third of the credit limit.
In June, Fair, Isaac plans to offer more online resources to consumers who buy their credit reports and scores from Equifax. They will be able, for example, to plug in some variables and get some idea of whether a given change will help their score. But Mr. Watts acknowledged that the program would probably not answer all of a consumer's questions.
Edmund Mierzwinski, a program director of the Public Interest Research Group, said, "They won't let you look under the hood or open the black box."

How to Get There? It Counts the Ways

BYLINE:  By SARAH MILSTEIN

 BODY:
EVERY day, millions of travelers research fares and hundreds of thousands buy airline tickets over the Internet, sometimes with just a few clicks of the mouse. They could be forgiven for not knowing that air-fare searching is an astonishingly complex computer task -- or that it took a small software company, founded a few years ago by a procrastinating graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, to help simplify the process.
 The company, ITA Software of Cambridge, Mass., had revenue of only $10 million last year for licensing its technology to the airlines -- less than the amount of tickets the airline industry sells online in a day. But ITA is a catalyst of a major change that has been reshaping airline reservations technology -- away from outdated and expensive mainframe computer systems and toward inexpensive desktop computers that, hooked together, can deliver vast amounts of computing power. 
 "ITA is a good example of how someone coming from outside the industry with no agenda is able to help the industry rewrite its future," said Henry H. Harteveldt, a senior analyst at Forrester Research, a technology consulting company. 
The founder of ITA, Jeremy Wertheimer, said that the company began as what he half-jokingly called a "thesis avoidance project." Mr. Wertheimer, 40, was a graduate student in artificial intelligence at M.I.T. in the early 1990's when he became interested in air-fare searching -- a classic computer science problem.
A single round-trip can have hundreds of millions of fare combinations. Fares have a range of variables: the array of airlines serving the route, the number of daily flights, connecting flights and dozens of airline rules (things like passenger eligibility, seasonal restrictions and advance-purchase requirements). International trips have even more possibilities. "It's unfathomably complex," Mr. Wertheimer said. 
Intrigued by how computers could wade through so much information to search for the cheapest fares quickly, he developed a demonstration program using Lisp, an artificial intelligence language that allows enormous quantities of data to be manipulated on a desktop computer. That program became the basis for ITA, which Mr. Wertheimer founded with friends in 1996. 
Other, bigger companies have created rival systems. Expedia, the travel booking Web site started by Microsoft, has developed a fare-search technology that runs on Windows NT servers. Sabre, whose reservations technology powers the Travelocity site, is developing a desktop platform to replace its mainframe system, which American Airlines and I.B.M. introduced in 1964.
Only recently have mainframes begun to lose favor in the airline industry. In the 1990's, when Mr. Wertheimer first researched fare searches, many airlines and travel agents still used systems developed in the 1950's. "I was sort of in awe because they were solving a very hard problem, and they didn't have the tools for it," Mr. Wertheimer said.
Alex Zoghlin, chief technology officer of Orbitz, a travel Web site started last spring by a consortium of airlines, attributed the relative backwardness of reservations technology until recently to the airline industry's reluctance to invest in it. The assumption, he said, had been that "the cost and effort were so high, it created a barrier to entry." Orbitz uses ITA's software.
Mainframe reservation systems can list fares for only a narrow parameter specified by the user -- say flights between Boston and Los Angeles at noon on a certain day. The user must screen the list generated by the mainframe to find the cheapest fares; if the user wants to know if there are cheaper fares at 9 a.m. or 2 p.m. that day, another mainframe search must be generated.
Moreover, mainframe fare searches return only about 10 choices. For some routes, Mr. Wertheimer noted, that number wouldn't even cover all of nonstop flights available. For people outside major cities, nonstop flights are rarely available, and the variations in choices can be vast.
"The thing that bothered me was that you had to make a lot of decisions before you could see a price," Mr. Wertheimer said, referring to the frustration of conducting many incrementally different searches to find the cheapest fares for one trip.
Mr. Wertheimer wanted to create a computerized search that would return the best answers for a much wider range of variables chosen by the user -- for instance the lowest fares in a 24-hour period.
"It's an interesting problem in that there's not one best answer," Mr. Wertheimer said. "Maybe the flight you want costs $206 through Fargo, but only $212 nonstop. Or for another $20, you could fly on an airline you like and collect frequent-flier miles. Or if you're flexible about the time of day, you could save $50."
ITA's software is designed to take into account a full day's schedule, regional airports near a selected destination, possible connecting flights and other factors, and then to return about 400 results sorted by price, flight duration, departure times and airline. The user can change the search parameters or the way results are displayed, then decide if he or she wants to make trade-offs -- perhaps an earlier departure or extra connection to get a lower fare.
SUCH consumer-centered programming has become more important in the industry as travelers buy more tickets online. 
Forrester Research estimates that consumers bought $9.1 billion of leisure air travel tickets online in 2001, or 10 percent of total passenger revenue for the year. The company projects $13.2 billion in online sales for 2002, growing to 14 percent of total passenger revenue, and $16.2 billion in sales for 2003, or 16.5 percent of the total.
Mainframe computers and software cannot support thousands of simultaneous searches in addition to sales (which result from only a small fraction of the searches on travel Web sites). ITA's software, and Expedia's, run on networks of inexpensive desktop computers that can be expanded easily.
Visitors to www.itasoftware.com, ITA's Web site, can try the software, but it can show only fares -- users cannot use the ITA site to book reservations. ITA's primary business is licensing software and selling services to airlines, companies that run reservation systems, travel agents and other industry groups.
Travelers are most likely to encounter the system on Orbitz, a flight booking Web site founded last spring by American, Continental, Delta, Northwest and United airlines. ITA said its searches would always return the lowest published fares available, but Orbitz, Expedia and Travelocity all have private deals with airlines, and for any given search a competing site may have a better fare. Expedia also offers air-fare packages with rental cars and hotels.
ITA, which originally stood for Internet Travel Agency, was initially capitalized with money from Mr. Wertheimer's father, Nathan, a jewelry manufacturer, and its first employees. In 1998, with a staff of only five, including Mr. Wertheimer, ITA landed its first deal, with Amadeus, the primary airline reservation system in Europe. Orbitz signed in 2000.
With market evidence that its software worked, and a burgeoning interest among airlines in Internet bookings, ITA found it easier to attract customers. In 2001, Delta Air Lines and SITA, an international fare-pricing organization, signed deals with ITA. America West is expected to announce a partnership with it in June.
With each contract, ITA has hired 10 people; it now has a staff of 45. But the company found that once it exhausted its network of programmers in the research field, it had difficulty finding qualified people.
Since last November, ITA has run a banner ad on Slashdot, a Web site that bills itself as "News for Nerds." That banner, and one on Freshmeat, a Slashdot affiliate, challenge readers to solve difficult programming puzzles. The ads have drawn nearly three million hits, and about 200 people have submitted answers, half of them correct. ITA has brought on three employees through this process and seven more through personal connections and postings on HotJobs.
Mr. Wertheimer said he was confident that he had hired great people, but he was cautious about growing too fast. "Hiring is still one of the more nerve-racking things," he said.
Still, ITA is growing, and Mr. Wertheimer said he saw opportunities in several areas. Within the airline industry, ITA software can be applied to help determine schedules and routes, for example. ITA could also apply its systems to tasks in other industries, like scheduling advertising in broadcast media.
"A lot of people have offered to buy us," he said, without being specific. "But we've turned them down because we can do a lot more here."

Boston to Los Angeles: 800 Million Fare Choices
AN air fare reflects a combination of things: airline, airport of origin, destination and applicable rules. In theory, there are immeasurable combinations, because a traveler could fly, say, from Boston to Los Angeles via London.
To set fares that might interest an average traveler, however, it is usually enough for a computer to search for the 400 most direct round trips. Even finding those requires sifting through hundreds of millions of possibilities. Here are the choices for Boston-Los Angeles round trips as ITA software seeks fares for nonstop and one-stop flights, leaving May 16 and returning May 23, with a 24-hour window for departures both days:
* The 400 possible outbound trips are multiplied by the 400 possible return trips , which equals 160,000 unique round-trip itineraries.
* For each round trip, there may be up to four legs (Boston to connecting city, connecting city to Los Angeles, and the reverse), and each represents a flight. Once rules and classes (economy, business, first class) are applied, each flight has about 30 fares. The number of fare combinations is thus 30 times 30 times 30 times 30, which equals 810,000.
* Of that 810,000, only about 5,000 typically pass the rules for a given route and passenger (special fares for the elderly, for example, or companion fares).
* The final numbers, then, are: 160,000 itineraries times 5,000 fares -- or 800 million possible fare combinations.
The cheapest round-trip fare found by ITA's system early this month was $309.50 on United, with nonstops both ways. SARAH MILSTEIN

HEADLINE: Dredging the Upper Hudson River, Without Slinging the Mud 

BYLINE:  By KIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: FORT EDWARD, N.Y., April 16 

 BODY:
A lot of people along this stretch of the Hudson River see Saratoga Springs, 10 miles west and a few dollars up on the economic scale, as a place with its nose in the air. So when word got out this spring that the federal Environmental Protection Agency had chosen Saratoga Springs for its upstate field office -- the staging area for its long-delayed program to dredge the Hudson of its PCB pollution -- the reaction was swift.
 A Fort Edward newspaper published a cartoon showing E.P.A. workers in biohazard suits sipping Champagne at a lawn party with the horse-and-pearls set. 
 The E.P.A., many people said, had struck a tone-deaf note in its first decision after more than 20 years of study, revealing how little had been learned about the river and its people.
The government promptly surrendered. Contractors are now working double shifts renovating a building in Fort Edward, not far from the most polluted areas. The office will open in May, two months behind schedule. 
"Nobody other than us thought it was a good idea," said Richard Caspe, an E.P.A. program director who will oversee the cleanup. Mr. Caspe said the Saratoga Springs site was chosen because it was in move-in condition and close to the New York State Thruway, not because it was nice. "So you live and you learn. We're big enough people that we're willing to live and learn."
The stumble may well be forgotten on a project that lasts 10 years or longer. But many people here and within the E.P.A. say that as a first step it also set the tone of what will be one of the largest industrial cleanups in United States history. The issues of engineering, transportation and hydrology are expected to be daunting, environmental experts say. But the political and human dimensions -- especially the degree to which the government has pledged to involve the community in planning and decision-making -- are likely to be just as crucial to the project's success or failure.
And hanging over everything is the heavy hand of history. Many residents here, and some scientists within the E.P.A., have lived the battle of the Hudson PCB's for much of their adult lives and careers, ever since 1976, when Congress banned all sale or use of the chemicals as evidence grew about its human health effects and impact on wildlife. 
From the first studies to track down the estimated 1.3 million pounds of PCB's that were spilled or discharged from the General Electric Company's factories in Fort Edward and in nearby Hudson Falls, through the subsequent political battles that raged from Albany to Washington about proposed remedies, positions became hardened and entrenched.
General Electric spent millions of dollars on scientific studies and advertisements arguing that sediment had entombed the chemicals, insulating them from the recovering life of the river. Mr. Caspe and other E.P.A. officials acknowledged that errors and misstatements over the years had damaged the government's credibility. Opponents of dredging in Congress pushed for tighter controls and safeguards. The result, in the E.P.A.'s final "record of decision" issued this year, was a document that mixes equal parts science and sociology.
Turning that legal order into a specific plan of action is an enormous task. Although dredging is not scheduled to begin until 2005, that leaves only three years -- a crash course, some environmental experts say -- to build what will be an industrial complex for dredging, all under the scrutiny of a community still widely suspicious of whether it should be done at all, and doubtful that it can be done right. 
"Scale is one of the significant attributes of this project, and the level of community involvement is another," said Philip Spadaro, director of port and harbor services at Hart Crowser, an environmental engineering and consulting company in Seattle that is not involved in the work here. "I'm not aware of anything approaching community involvement like they plan to have on the Hudson." 
This summer, 3,000 core samples will be taken from the river's bottom. Although general maps show where the PCB's, or polychlorinated biphenyls, were deposited after leaving G.E.'s factories from the 1940's into the 1970's, getting the oily yellow chemicals out of the mud will require what is in effect a zoom lens close-up, pinpointing exact concentrations and locations.
The core samples will in turn shape the decision of where to build the first of what could be two huge sludge-processing plants, which will remove water from the dredge spoils after they are removed. The first plant site, E.P.A. officials say, must be selected by the end of this year to be up and ready in time.
The system of rail and barge transport for the removed sludge and chemicals will be equally immense. The government plans to dig out 2.65 million cubic yards of mud and sediment, and then put 1 million cubic yards of clean earth back along a 40-mile stretch of river extending just south from here. The cost, about $460 million, is to be paid by G.E. And in a bow to community concerns about traffic and air pollution, not a single bit, the government has said, will be hauled by truck. 
That's a prodigious pile of mud. By volume, 2.65 million cubic yards is about 20 times as much limestone as the ancient Romans used to build the Colosseum, and enough, if hauled entirely by rail, to fill 37,000 rail cars, which would stretch from New York City almost to Chicago.
At the same time, facilitators and focus group coordinators are likely to become as common in Fort Edward as engineers in hip-waders. An environmental consulting company in Arlington, Va., the Marasco Newton Group, is expected to arrive here next week for several months of polling and interviewing, the first step toward building the community involvement system required by the dredging order. 
No one knows what that system will look like. It might involve a kind of board of trustees with a network of subcommittees to oversee various aspects of the project. Or perhaps some other structure will emerge depending on what residents say they want, a Marasco spokeswoman said.
What will give those community groups their power are written performance standards. Levels are to be set on most aspects of the project, including noise, the impact on recreation and the spillage of PCB's back into the water, and the rules will then be reviewed by scientists and the public before they are issued. 
Opponents of the dredging plan, led by Fort Edward's supervisor, Merrilyn Pulver, say they plan to use the performance standards to hang the E.P.A. with its own rope. Ms. Pulver said the town was talking with independent monitoring consultants, with the idea that when standards are violated -- and she is certain that they will be -- every legal remedy can be pursued and the work halted.
Mr. Caspe, who directs the Superfund program at the E.P.A.'s regional New York office in Manhattan, agreed that enforceable standards could create a bar that the E.P.A. might fail to reach. But he said that is as it should be for the protection of the river and the residents.
"There are people who have said that if we truly develop objective performance standards, we will fail and the job will stop," he said. "We say, 'Make the standards fair and reasonable, then let the chips fall where they will.' " 
Other issues in Fort Edward are too dynamic to predict.
The fight against dredging, for example, led by the current town supervisor, is being squarely countered by the man she replaced in the job, Terry R. Seeley, a restaurant owner. Mr. Seeley founded a group last year, Hudson River Care, specifically to remind people of what G.E.'s pollution did to the community. Using money from what he said were "grass-roots sources," he plans to open an office on Broadway, Fort Edward's main street, dispensing his own recommendations on how people should think about the river, the government and G.E.
"Love Canal came back; Fort Edward can come back," Mr. Seeley said. "We have natural resources. We have very historic sites; we want to focus on those sites. We're just making very, very sure that everyone understands that help is on the way and how you can be part of that."
General Electric is another wild card. The company offered this month to take over much of the design and planning process, including all the core sampling work this summer. The E.P.A. will not comment on the offer, but has said that discussions are continuing and could be resolved within months.
Residents are also staking out new positions as the reality of dredging sets in.
Van Tasker, 75, a retired telephone company employee who has lived all his life in Fort Edward, drives a car plastered with antidredging bumper stickers. But that was his attitude, he said, when it was just a debating point. "Now that it's settled, I just want it done right, and I'm glad we've got some say-so in it, that they're letting the local people have some input," he said.
There is also a subtle recognition, even among die-hard opponents of dredging, that something has shifted -- maybe not quite enough to alter an opinion, but perhaps enough to reconsider one's opponent. 
"I guess maybe it's the first time that we can actually say that E.P.A. went in a different direction because of the stance the upper river community has taken," said Ms. Pulver, referring to the abandonment of the Saratoga Springs plan. "That's new. That's a new concept for E.P.A."
The new director of Fort Edward field office, N. G. Kaul, the longtime chief of the Division of Water at the State Department of Environmental Conservation, said his job in the new office would officially be to provide information to the community about every step in the cleanup process. Unofficially, he said, he will function as a sounding board and perhaps now and then as a target for abuse.
"I'll either die in the attempt, or they'll grow to love me," he said.

 BODY:
 THE MYTH OF OWNERSHIP
Taxes and Justice.
By Liam Murphy and Thomas Nagel.
228 pp. New York:
Oxford University Press. $25.
 When President Bush, promoting tax cuts, says people's incomes belong to them and not the government, the authors of this book say he is using fuzzy logic. Liam Murphy and Thomas Nagel, professors of law and philosophy at New York University, argue in the "The Myth of Ownership" that Mr. Bush's rhetoric is emblematic of a tax debate that focuses on the wrong issues because it lacks a moral foundation. 
They assert that a naive philosophy of "everyday libertarianism" infects American politics with a "robust and compelling fantasy that we earn our income and the government takes some of it away from us." This popular myth "results in widespread hostility to taxes, and a political advantage to those who campaign against them and attack the I.R.S." 
This fantasy grows from the acceptance by all sides in the tax debate that gross, or pretax, incomes are presumptively just and therefore the proper moral base line to begin debate. The authors say pretax incomes are morally insignificant, an idea they confess is hard to sell. They argue that "individual citizens don't own anything except through laws that are enacted and enforced by the state," because without government there would be anarchy, an endless war of all-against-one that would diminish incomes and wealth, not to mention life itself. Thus it is after-tax incomes that people are entitled to own. These ideas will encounter a hostile reception from partisans in the debate of the past quarter-century, in which the prevailing political rhetoric characterizes taxes as sheer waste, an unfair drag on the most productive people and an evil. 
The thoughts in this book deserve examination, especially the views of Nagel and Murphy on the self-interest each taxpayer reasonably has in the social justice purchased by hard-earned money. Unfortunately, their carefully developed arguments are mixed with a hostility to inherited wealth that will make it easy for those who are paid to promote hatred of taxes to dismiss them as soak-the-rich types with nothing new to say. 
The practical problem here is that gross incomes are commonly seen as just rewards for one's commitment to work, as well as one's willingness to take investment risks. But that belief assumes that the market rewards each endeavor according to its value, an assumption that collapses under scrutiny, as the manipulations at Enron and Global Crossing remind us. Government enacts rules on employment, influences interest rates, allows widely different qualities of education in school districts and imposes countless policies that distort distribution of pretax incomes -- compared with what they might be in a libertarian world of voluntary contracts and no government. Pretax incomes are presumed just, the authors posit, for the same reason slavery was once the law of the land: pervasiveness makes legal inventions appear to be natural law. 
Murphy and Nagel say using pretax incomes as the basis of debate defies logic, since "one can neither justify nor criticize an economic regime by taking as an independent norm something that is, in fact, one of its consequences." To them, acceptance of pretax income as a moral base line means that "serious public discussion of economic justice has been largely displaced by specious rhetoric about tax fairness," resulting in a "radical climate" of tax proposals favoring the rich. 
Taxes, they write, need to be examined in the context of government spending so that one sees both costs and benefits. The constitutional mandate to "promote the general welfare" should guide tax policy, not theories about lowering marginal tax rates and favors for savers. They even argue that it may be reasonable to tax people with similar incomes differently if that achieves a social good. The measure of justice and fairness in tax, they emphasize, should be the outcomes of tax policy, especially whether each newborn gets enough of society's resources to have a fair shot at success in life. They argue that poverty is bad for rich and poor alike, and that the poor, especially when it comes to educating children, have one of the strongest moral claims on tax dollars. 
They object to a myopic focus in the tax debate on how tax burdens are distributed among income classes. In this they ignore a simple truth: for the public such measures are much easier to assess than is determining government's success in promoting the general welfare. 
The authors call the current policy of forgiving capital gains at death "an outrage." When combined with other tax breaks for those with assets, it is, they say, "an egregious injustice in the current tax scheme," because it perpetuates inequity and lavishes rewards on those who are fortunate in their ancestry but may contribute nothing useful to society. Their solution would be a fundamental reform: make recipients of large inheritances and gifts pay taxes, just as wage earners must.
Nagel and Murphy give too little attention to the role of taxes in creating wealth. Peace is a boon to hoteliers, Conrad Hilton pointed out in his will. Without vast taxpayer investments in keeping the peace, as well as in building roads and airports, his fortune would have been much smaller. Many modern billionaires owe much of their wealth to the taxpayers for investing in education, and the scientific advancements on which their products depend. Murphy and Nagel do not examine whether it would be just to look on such big economic winners as successful investments of tax dollars, and then taxing these winners to insure that society has sufficient resources to invest in each new generation. 
They also ignore the morality of tax enforcement and its role in tax justice. Is it moral to prosecute and imprison an illiterate former cotton picker over less than $100,000 in taxes unpaid over the years while looking the other way when two billionaires go 30 years without filing tax returns, as the I.R.S. and Justice Department have done within the last five years? Is it is fair to audit the working poor far more intensely than everyone else? And just how does any of this promote the general welfare? 
Murphy and Nagel offer ideas that would improve the national debate over how we should tax ourselves, even if their views never gain popular acceptance. What is more likely, unhappily, is that reasoned suggestions -- from many sources -- will be drowned out in the din of mindless antitax sound bites.

HEADLINE: The Selling of an Energy Policy 

BYLINE:  By Al Gore; Al Gore, vice president from 1993 to 2001, is a professor at Fisk University and Middle Tennessee State University.

DATELINE: NASHVILLE 

 BODY:
Under the presidency of George W. Bush, the environmental and energy policies of our government are completely dominated by a group of current and former oil and chemical company executives who are trying to dismantle America's ability to force them to reduce the extremely dangerous levels of pollution in the earth's atmosphere.
 The first step was to withdraw from the agreement reached in Kyoto to begin limiting worldwide emissions of greenhouse gases. Then the administration cancelled an agreement requiring automobile companies to make the leap to more fuel-efficient vehicles. 
 Other acts of sabotage are taking place behind the scenes. Just as Enron executives were allowed to interview candidates for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission -- and to veto those they didn't think would approve of Enron's agenda -- ExxonMobil has been allowed to veto the United States government's selection of who will head the prestigious scientific panel that monitors global warming. Dr. Robert Watson, the highly respected leader of the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change, was blackballed in a memo to the White House from the nation's largest oil company. The memo had its effect last Friday, when Dr. Watson lost his bid for re-election after the administration threw its weight behind the "let's drag our feet" candidate, Dr. Rajendra Pachauri of New Delhi, who is known for his virulent anti-American statements. 
Why is this happening?
Because the largest polluters know their only hope for escaping restrictions lies in promoting confusion about global warming.
Just as Enron needed auditors who wouldn't blow the whistle when the company lied about the magnitude of its future liabilities, the administration needs scientific reviews that won't sound the alarm on the destruction of the earth's climate balance.
How long they get away with it depends on how long they can sow confusion and doubt. But with folks wearing bikinis in Boston in the middle of April and with the massive melting of ice at both poles and in nearly every mountain glacier on earth, public awareness and concern are growing rapidly.
At a time when the world needs enduring leadership from the United States to rally all nations to join in a concerted effort to stop global warming, the administration is working overtime to block any progress whatsoever.
So tomorrow, on this Earth Day, more than ever before, we need real, forward-thinking leadership and a renewed focus on the environment. True leadership means ensuring that we take the necessary steps to leave a cleaner environment for generations to come -- and that means strengthening environmental protections.
Instead, this administration's so-called Clean Skies initiative actually increases air pollution levels by allowing more toxic mercury, nitrogen oxide and sulfur emissions than does current law. Put simply, on the environment, this administration has consistently sold out America's future in return for short-term political gains.
True leadership means guaranteeing our national security and role as a world leader -- and one of the best ways to do this is by decreasing our dangerous dependence on foreign oil, so that America cannot be held hostage to oil imports and tinhorn tyrants like Saddam Hussein. But instead this administration is now investing less in energy innovation and conservation and more in corporate subsidies for oil exploration and extraction and nuclear power.
True leadership means assuring an economy that rewards innovation and productivity. We can do so by leading the world in investments in technological innovations that will result in environment-friendly products like more efficient cars and renewable energy sources. Such investments would open up the door for new economic growth. But this administration is taking only those steps that increase our addiction to fossil fuels and outdated and inefficient technologies.
On all these fronts, this administration has walked away from the tough choices and has instead chosen to subsidize the solutions of the past. Instead of leading, it has attempted to mislead. Instead of sharing a vision with the people, the administration has given access to special interests.
We can return to the path of progress, on which we value economic growth that rewards innovation and productivity and meets the needs of our families and of national security. We can return to the days of record growth coupled with record improvement in the air we breathe. We can return to true leadership on the environment. 
We ought to look at the environment as a critical piece of the nation we will be. I urge Americans to re-engage in a forward-looking discussion of how to secure our nation's energy needs while pursuing environmental policies that will make us safer, more efficient and more respectful stewards of our planet and our nation's great potential.

HEADLINE: The World: Back to Earth; 
War Was Easy. The Rest of the World Is a Mess.

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
IN every presidency, there comes a moment when the clear-cut visions and simple declarations of a political campaign run headlong into the reality of how the world works.
 It happened to John F. Kennedy, who saw Dwight D. Eisenhower's national security apparatus as ossified, tossed it out before he learned which of his own experts to trust, and plunged into the Bay of Pigs. It happened to Jimmy Carter, whose early thinking about the cold war produced a declaration that it was time to pull American troops out of South Korea -- and an uproar that taught him how important an American military presence remained in Asia. It happened to Bill Clinton, who focused like a laser-beam on the economy, only to stumble in Haiti, Somalia and China. 
 The moment has come now for George W. Bush. 
In the last few weeks, the president has clouded the reputation for clarity of purpose and resoluteness that he richly earned after Sept. 11. Indeed, the very fact that he handled the early days of the war on terror so adroitly has made the contrast with the last month all the more evident.
His troubles have come in disparate places, where laser-guided ordnance, and good-vs.-evil distinctions, don't help much.
The most obvious is the Middle East, where Mr. Bush came late and ill-prepared, where moral clarity is in short supply and where the administration is deeply divided on the proper strategy. The result has been extraordinary presidential wavering, as Mr. Bush has veered toward giving Israel the time and space to finish off Yasir Arafat's Palestinian Authority, to demanding Israel's withdrawal "without delay" and then, last week, to pursuing both strategies at once.
There is Afghanistan, reeling from the ravages of Soviet occupation, warlordism, the Taliban, and the war on terror. There Mr. Bush called last week for a Marshall plan, a pirouette from his dismissiveness toward "nation-building" during the campaign.
And there is Latin America, whose leaders last year celebrated the inauguration of a president who spoke their language and talked of extending Nafta throughout the continent. Now, Mr. Bush's muted reaction to a coup attempt in Venezuela has led to questions about whether the Bush White House celebrates democracy only when it produces governments Mr. Bush finds amenable.
All this may represent just the growing pains of an Administration in office for only 15 months, half of which have been spent coping with a world suddenly on fire. "The lesson of the past month," a weary-sounding senior White House adviser reflected last week, "is that Sept. 11 was so horrific that it made for easy choices, almost all of which are behind us.
"And everything ahead -- Israel, the Palestinians, Iraq, even dealing with our fair-weather friends in Europe -- doesn't fit that template."
At first glance, the administration should be spectacularly well prepared for this moment. Its only newcomer to tricky diplomatic choices is the president himself. The rest of the team has more experience in the world's troubles than any in decades. But they have famously different points of view. If only they could stop playing out what Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, once called "the ordinary creative tension of decision making" once the decisions are made.
Oddly enough in a White House that prides itself on corporate-style discipline and decision-making, the past few weeks have seen constant recalculating and repositioning, to the dismay of one camp of advisers or another and the confusion of everyone else.
Nowhere has that been more evident than in the president's late intervention in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Mr. Bush told his aides last year that he wanted "to park" the issue while he dealt with terrorism and the immediate threat of Iraq and other states seeking weapons of mass destruction. In a perfect Bush world, the subjects would be neatly divorced. But they are not -- as conventional wisdom has long stated and as Vice President Dick Cheney discovered on his Mideast trip.
The Administration, which is always questioning conventional wisdom, still insists that the United States will do whatever it needs to do with Iraq. "We just can't afford to let one problem, no matter how acute it is and how serious it is, paralyze us," said Paul D. Wolfowitz, the deputy secretary of defense.
Perhaps not, but the issue has already brought out all the old divisions between Colin L. Powell's camp in the State Department, which has deplored the administration's confrontational approach on many issues, and the hawks around Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Mr. Cheney.
The big mystery in Washington is whether Mr. Bush finds this constant tension amusing, useful or just convenient. He certainly plays all sides. On Easter weekend at his ranch in Texas, with Israel and the West Bank aflame, Mr. Bush spoke to reporters just hours after the United States voted for a United Nations resolution including a call on Israel to withdraw from Palestinian cities.
BUT that wasn't his message. Instead he talked about Ariel Sharon's "right of self-defense", a phrase often used by Mr. Cheney and Republican conservatives. The Israelis interpreted that as a green light. Then, when Mr. Bush made a speech calling for Israel to withdraw, the Palestinians to denounce terrorism, and the Arab states to help pursue peace rather than egg on the intifada, many wondered if Mr. Powell had prevailed. Or was Mr. Bush just trying to quiet the region for the moment?
General Powell seemed to be wondering the same thing last week. While he was shuttling between the immovable Mr. Sharon and the imprisoned but newly-empowered Mr. Arafat, stories swirled around Washington that White House political operatives were worried about alienating their conservative base. On Thursday, Mr. Bush called Mr. Sharon a "man of peace" and said he understood why Israeli forces remain in Ramallah and Bethlehem. Was he abandoning his call, just 12 days before, for full withdrawal "without delay?"
The White House insisted that that Mr. Bush had just stated the facts: That Israel had begun to withdraw, and the Palestinians had done little. "The president speaks in plain language," said one aide. "He calls it like he sees it."
But that doesn't mean he always communicates it with the clarity he commanded a few months ago. On Wednesday at the Virginia Military Institute, he said he sees the need for a new Marshall Plan for Afghanistan. The reference is fascinating because candidate Bush had lambasted the Clinton crowd for diverting the American military for "nation-building." But "Marshall Plan" fits Afghanistan poorly because the land is so unlike postwar Europe. Europe had built modern industrial economies before World War II, complete with cultures trained and equipped for dynamic economic progress.
"President Bush was stretching it a bit," said Mark A. Stoler, a Marshall biographer and professor of history at the University of Vermont. "The Marshall plan was a symbol of altruism and long-term self-interest. But the situation is totally different."
Mr. Bush's approach also seemed a bit murky when Hugo Chavez, the fiery, anti-American president of Venezuela, appeared to be overthrown 10 days ago. While the Administration voted for an Organization of American States resolution urging strict adherence to the constitution in Venezuela, it did not exactly condemn the coup plotters, many of whom it knew pretty well. The result was embarrassing (particularly when Mr. Chavez turned up back in office two days later). It left a feeling that, as one former American ambassador to the region put it, the United States "talks about democracy but supports it only if people vote the way we want them to."
Of course, every presidency is a learning curve in motion. Some historians now believe that President Kennedy's troubles at the Bay of Pigs taught him critical lessons that helped him manage the Cuban Missile Crisis. The question today is whether a president who faced his biggest crisis early on, and did well, will learn as much from his encounters with global ambiguities as he did from his one with "unvarnished evil."

HEADLINE: Word for Word/The Johnson Tapes; 
Eavesdropping on the Brokering Of Presidential Power

BYLINE:  By SAM ROBERTS 

 BODY:
"I DO understand power, whatever else may be said about me," Lyndon B. Johnson once explained. "I know where to look for it, and how to use it."
 As the Senate majority leader, Johnson consummately brokered power as a legislator ("Master of the Senate," the latest installment in Robert A. Caro's multi-volume biography, is being published this month). Later, as president, Johnson perfected his use of power and also found its exercise more problematic. 
 Earlier this month, the Lyndon B. Johnson Library and Museum released the latest trove of recordings and, in some cases, transcripts of the president's telephone conversations. With characteristic bluntness and earthiness, he confronted domestic, foreign and personal events in 1965. Edited excerpts follow. SAM ROBERTS
On Aug. 6, 1965, Johnson was browbeating Carl B. Albert, the House majority leader, to speed the Johnson agenda through Congress. Albert ticked off bills, and Johnson commented.
Albert: -- the Military Construction Appropriations -- 
Johnson: I can pass that in an hour. 
Albert: We'll pass that.
Johnson: An hour. Now come on, come on, come on. Let me hear -- that's not anything. 
Albert: All right.
Johnson: Because I just hate to lose that $700 million.
Albert: Well, you're not going to lose it.
Johnson: We got a chance to make the greatest record in the history of the world.
Albert: We can tell you what we can do and we can tell you when we can do it. 
Johnson: All right. Now I've given you all a list for three weeks and you haven't knocked a bill off of it. So I want to really pass them . . . . 
On Aug. 20, 1965, the president and his aides called Cyrus R. Vance, then deputy defense secretary. Johnson was concerned that Congress had sent him legislation that would tie his hands in closing domestic military bases and questioned whether he had grounds to veto the law.
Johnson: I've just got 60 days in a night law school and I hate like hell to have to talk about what's constitutional with you cum laude boys. . . .
Vance: Mr. President, we didn't want to put you in a spot in this. We felt that --
Johnson: I'm in a spot. You haven't got a choice about that, sweetheart. I'm done there. It's on my desk and I've got to sign it and I've just got 12 hours to do it. And the attorney general's at Martha's Vineyard and the stuff I've got here's the biggest bunch of crap I've looked at since I left Mexican school where I used to teach."
On Aug. 14, 1965, Johnson spoke with Joseph A. Califano Jr., then a presidential special assistant, about the Watts riots in Los Angeles, which erupted on Aug. 11 and lasted five days. 
Johnson: I'm not going to send a bunch of prosecutors out there. I'm not going to send anybody out there that the state doesn't ask for. I don't want to completely admit that city government and state government and county government is impotent in this country and that I'm a dictator. . . .
Califano: Yes sir.
Johnson: Be sure that they are utilizing all the facilities they have. And if they are using all of their own facilities and have no other way to do it and they request it of us, then it's approved right now. You just get it to me and I'll initial it so damn quick it'll make your head swim.
Califano: Yes sir. And we have, General Abrams is doing that with everyone. He has shown them, for example, in their earlier requests for aircraft to help lift their troops that they had the ability to do it themselves and they did it themselves.
 On Aug. 20, 1965, the president and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. discussed the riots. 
King: Well, I will tell you Mr. President. I have met with all levels of leadership here and talked with people in the Watts area. . . . I am not optimistic at this point about the possible outcome of the thing.
Johnson: By the way, I made -- you might misunderstand it -- but I took the statement you made the other day and one or two others made about our making laws to help people and we all have to obey the law and cannot violate it either as Klansmen or with Molotov cocktails, that we should all obey the law. I made that to the Equal Employment people today and made it pretty strong, but I wound it up by saying that what we have to do is find a cure and go in and correct these conditions where the ghettos, housing, rats eating the children, schools, hunger, unemployment, etc. etc. We are all God's children and we had better get at it. But I wanted you to know that I had said that.
King: Wonderful. That is fine. 
King then complained that local officials were being insensitive and were reluctant to "grant just a few concessions to bring about a new sense of hope."
King: Now what is frightening is to hear all of these tones of violence from people out there in the Watts area and the minute that happens, there will be retaliation from the white community. People have bought up guns so that I am fearful that if something isn't done to give a new sense of hope to people in that area . . . a full-scale race war can develop, and I am concerned because I know that violence does not take care of the matter. 
Johnson: Well now, what should we do about it? What is your recommendation?
King: If they could get, in the next few days, this poverty program going in Los Angeles, I believe that it would help us.
The president recalled a speech he had delivered at Howard University, reminding King of Johnson's commitment to civil rights and to alleviating poverty. The president cautioned that Senate votes on Great Society legislation had been perilously close and that without wider public support the agenda that he and King shared would be jeopardized. 
Johnson: Just say the clock is ticking -- that the hands are moving, and the good Lord is going to allow us some time, and he is trying to give us some warning, but the country has to stand up and support what I am doing. I cannot have these poverty votes hitting me 44 to 43. That is just too close for the United States Senate!
I have been seeing you on television every night. You make a reasonable, fair, just presentation but I think you sould say that the president recognized this thing months ago . . . .
King: Well, I point to that Howard University speech. I think it is the best one you have ever made and the best analysis of the problem I have ever seen anywhere -- and certainly no president has ever said it like that before. . . .
The president segued into a defense of his policies in Vietnam, urging King to help clarify his position on the war to the public.
They all have the impression . . . that you are against me in Vietnam. You better not leave that impression. I want peace as much as you do and more so, because I am the fellow that wakes up in the morning with a report that 50 of our boys died last night. These folks just will not come to the conference table.
King: I have said this, Mr. President, that I am concerned about peace and I have made it very clear -- I think my position has probably been misinterpreted -- but I have made it clear that at the present time, two things: one, that it is just unreasonable to talk about the United States having a unilateral withdrawal. On the other hand, you have called 14 or 15 times for unconditional talks and it is Hanoi that has not responded.
Johnson (interrupting): That is right. That is a perfect position. It is just exactly the position. . . . Call in and report to us and if you have any suggestions or recommendations, why, I am just as close as the telephone. If you haven't got the money to pay it, why call me collect.
King (laughing): All right. Goodbye, Mr. President.
 On Oct. 5, 1965, the president called Robert F. Kennedy, the attorney general.
Johnson: Bobby, how are you?
Kennedy: Fine, thanks, Mr. President. How are you?
Johnson: Pretty good. I'm going to have a little operation Friday morning for a gall bladder condition that we're going to announce in a little bit. And was calling you on another matter but I thought I might tell you before you heard it on the radio.
Kennedy: Oh, I see. It's not serious is it?
Johnson: I don't think so. . . . But no one ever knows till they get it behind them. It hasn't given me any trouble but they think it might rupture or something so they want it taken care of. I've got a lot of stones.
Kennedy: Well take care of yourself, Mr. President.
On Nov. 4, 1965, Johnson spoke with Roy Wilkins, the leader of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. They discussed Robert C. Weaver's appointment as secretary of the newly created Department of Housing and Urban Development -- which would make him the first black Cabinet member. Johnson said Mr. Weaver's decision to impose a regulation that would deny certain rent subsidies to people worth less than $25,000 "the biggest bonehead any man ever pulled." 
Johnson: Now that meant that a middle-class Jewish fellow living in Chicago could get his rent supplemented. Now what we are trying to do is put this in for the bottom 10 percent or 15 percent and we want it really as a substitute for public housing. So we want it for the poor people and I would guess that 75 percent of them would be Negroes. 
But some fool wrote the regulation and a Republican got a hold of it named Harvey of Michigan and he pointed out that this crazy man Weaver was letting people that had $25,000 live in a house where we paid the rent. And it was true.
The only thing Weaver could do when he got back from running around all over the country -- now, Roy, I don't know whether you know it or not, but that is the principal defect of the Negroes in government -- did you know that? They just have to travel. From the minute they take the oath, they get an airplane ticket.
On Oct. 22, 1965, the president spoke with Arthur J. Goldberg, who was then ambassador to the United Nations. Johnson complained that, typically, financial aid to Latin America was being siphoned off by corrupt local officials who also regularly reneged on their vows to make land and tax policies more equitable.
Johnson: So we pour in $600 million and it winds up in the same place. Now we've got $600 million more this year. I want to put it in. I am ready to put it in. I am anxious to put it in. But I'll be damned if I am going to have it said of me that I was just a numbskull here for four years and got nothing in return, because my mama didn't raise me that way. . . .
Just tell these Latin Americans -- every damn one you see every day -- that you talk to the president every day, that he wants to make the roses bloom. He wants every child to be free of disease, to be educated, have a good job and live in a fine home, but his hopes have got to be a two way street. You can't just marry a woman and let her run off and stay drunk all the time. She has got to come home and help too. 
Now if they are not going to do their land reform and if they are not going to do their tax reform and they are going to continue to talk about it like they have since 1958 . . . they are not going to get one lousy dime.
Goldberg: Amen, amen.
On Dec. 27, 1965, Johnson, joined by Robert S. McNamara, the defense secretary, spoke to General Maxwell D. Taylor about whether to extend a bombing halt in Vietnam. 
Johnson: The man on the street really feels that we have not done enough on the political side and that our diplomatic moves have been totally inadequate. 
Now we're going to walk into the lion's den with our own people, and I would not say this to many men but I can say it to you in confidence, that I feel a good deal of the ice cracking under me and slipping on the domestic scene. Election coming up. Every man going up to his congressman saying: "What's going to happen to my boy? Why can't you get us out of there? And why haven't you tried to do this and so on and so forth?"
But we believe that we could go New Year's Eve and New Year's Day. We think it would be a good time to say to the Soviet that you've been talking about, "you can't do anything while you're bombing North Vietnam," how we've told you, and we haven't bombed it in four days. Unless there's some catastrophe or something unusual happens we won't bomb it for at least another four. And if we could get anybody really interested in doing anything and they had any influence on the Chinese or on the North Vietnamese, why we could extend it longer than that.
We think the odds are 95 to 5, I do, that nothing would happen. But we would be able to say to the doubting Thomases, and there are a good many of them in the Senate, and the 43 percent of the American people . . . We paused for 11 or 12 days this year and they didn't do anything about it. And we have gone the last mile, we've searched everywhere we know of, and we think that we can do it now with less danger and less trouble than we can later. And we think that we need it now to get the support and unity back home that we could get.
Taylor: . . . I have been opposed to a pause as a formal announced effort to see what the enemy would do. I feel that it would be futile. And actually create conditions under which they could hardly respond even if they wanted to.
Johnson: So have I, that's been my feeling.
Taylor: But I would say this, if you feel that a pause is almost inevitable this is the best time to do it.
Back-channel talks failed. The American bombing halt ended on Jan. 31.

HEADLINE: Bush Policies Have Been Good to Energy Industry 

BYLINE:  By DON VAN NATTA Jr. with NEELA BANERJEE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 20 

 BODY:
By voting this week to block drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, the Senate dealt a setback to the petroleum industry and to President Bush, who had made oil exploration in the refuge a cornerstone of his national energy policy.
 But the defeat was hardly total. The oil and gas industries -- indeed, the entire energy industry -- have won an abundance of appointments and regulatory decisions made by Mr. Bush and his 15-month-old administration. For example, in the House energy bill passed last year, and the Senate bill still being debated, the energy industry stands to gain billions of dollars of tax credits and subsidies. 
 The Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management has begun opening public lands for oil and gas exploration. Last year, four million new acres were added for oil, gas and coal mining, up from 2.6 million acres in 2000, agency data shows. 
And environmental groups are complaining that the Environmental Protection Agency is considering changing water pollution rules to make it easier for coal companies to mine for coal by removing whole mountaintops. Currently, the earth carved from mountains is defined as waste and cannot be dumped into streams and rivers. The environmental agency is considering changing the definition in a way that would allow coal companies to discard the mountaintop refuse into the water, defining it as allowable "fill."
One day after the release of the White House's national energy report last May, President Bush visited a Pennsylvania hydropower plant and vowed that his administration would quickly carry out the plan.
"I can assure the American people that mine is an administration that's not interested in gathering dust," Mr. Bush said.
That same day, Mr. Bush signed two executive orders that had been recommended by influential trade groups, the American Petroleum Institute and the American Gas Association. The orders were intended to speed the construction of new energy projects. Environmentalists and some Congressional Democrats criticized the president for what they described as allowing the industry to "hold his pen."
An administration official estimated at the time that 85 of the 105 energy proposals in the national energy policy could take effect without Congressional action.
Already, the administration has moved repeatedly to increase oil and gas production and roll back regulations put in place or strengthened during the Clinton administration.
Critics of the administration's energy policies say the White House is rewarding its campaign supporters.
"We cannot dig, drill and destroy our way to true energy independence," said Sharon Buccino, a senior lawyer at the Natural Resources Defense Council. "If the Bush administration truly had the good of us all in mind, they would get serious about fuel economy and efficiency.."
Scott McLellan, deputy White House press secretary, said the administration was determined to keep energy affordable and to protect the environment. "This is the first administration in decades to address the energy needs of every American in a comprehensive way with a comprehensive plan," he said.
Mr. Bush has named at least 30 former energy industry executives, lobbyists and lawyers to influential jobs in his administration. Some of them have helped the government carry out major parts of the energy policy without waiting for Congressional action.
Executives and lobbyists for the nation's energy industry have long argued that the Clinton administration had granted environmental groups far greater access when formulating energy policies. Now, they say, the pendulum has swung the other way, with the Bush administration developing a more balanced position that emphasizes increasing the output of oil, coal and power.
"The people running the United States government are from the energy industry," said Fredrick D. Palmer, executive vice president of external affairs for Peabody Energy, the world's largest coal company. "They understand it and they believe in energy supply."
More than any other part of the energy business, the coal industry seems to have fared best under the Bush administration. The industry provided critical support for Mr. Bush in traditionally Democratic states during the last election, most notably in West Virginia. 
More than 50 percent of the nation's electricity is generated by coal-burning plants.
"For eight years, we had an administration that was actively antagonistic to coal and oil," said Rob Long, vice president for governmental affairs for the National Mining Association. "To have an administration that is even agnostic on fossil fuels is an improvement."
The Bush administration and Congressional energy bills plan to give the coal industry $3.37 billion in financing and tax incentives over the next 10 years to develop expensive, experimental technologies to burn coal more cleanly.
Environmentalists argue that clean-coal research is wasteful, citing recent reports by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, that say the existing Clean Coal Technology Program was badly mismanaged.
And regardless of how coal is burned, the industry's critics object to mining practices like mountaintop mining, used mainly in West Virginia. Environmentalists say mountaintop removal has despoiled 1,000 miles of streams.
William B. Raney, president of the West Virginia Coal Association, asserts that the state's water protection laws are the toughest in the country. But local environmentalists say the Bush administration, unlike the Clinton administration, has not rejected state regulations that weaken protection of the water system. Environmental groups are suing the Bush E.P.A. over the question.
The environmentalists say that the Bush E.P.A. is moving to change a rule in the Clean Water Act that would make it easier for coal companies to remove mountaintops. Currently, the earth carved from mountains is defined as waste and cannot be dumped into streams and rivers.
An agency spokesman, Joe Martyak, said no decisions had been made, so it was "premature" to judge the agency's actions.
A clear early victory for the fossil fuel industry came in March 2001, when President Bush decided not to impose new controls on emissions of carbon dioxide, a gas widely believed to cause global warming. He said he feared such limits would endanger economic growth. 
The decision reversed his campaign pledge to set mandatory reduction targets for carbon dioxide. Energy lobbyists oppose mandatory regulation of carbon dioxide emissions.
The administration is now pushing ahead with its "Clear Skies" initiative aimed at reducing emissions of nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide, which are already regulated as pollutants, as well as mercury, which is not. It will not address carbon dioxide emissions. A bill offered by Senator Jim Jeffords of Vermont, an independent whose defection from the Republican Party handed control of the Senate to the Democrats, would regulate all four pollutants.
"We like the approach that they have proposed on the three-pollutant strategy," Bill Brier, vice president of communications of the Edison Electric Institute, a power industry lobbying group, said of the White House's position on climate change. "We feel this approach would eliminate 75 percent of pollutants people claim lead to health ailments."
With Mr. Bush's roots in the Texas oil patch, many in the oil industry and the environmental community thought the business would thrive under this administration. The oil industry would certainly benefit from the White House's refusal to mandate reductions in carbon dioxide and its efforts to reshape clean air regulations.
But some goals specific to the industry have been thwarted, among them efforts to widen the acreage for natural gas drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, off the coast of Florida, and to have unilateral sanctions against Iran and Libya lifted.
The industry, however, may benefit from a sizable windfall, thanks to a decision by the Bush administration not to reauthorize taxes that feed the Superfund toxic waste cleanup program. Instead, most of the costs would be shifted from industry to taxpayers. The decision not to seek reauthorization has been challenged by Senate Democrats.

A chart on Sunday showing ties between officials of the Interior Department and the energy and mining industries, with an article about Bush administration policies that have benefited the industry, misstated the connection of Patricia Lynn Scarlett, assistant secretary for policy, management and budget, to the Reason Foundation, a libertarian research group. She is its former president, not its current one. The chart also misstated the source of the foundation's financing. Mining and oil companies provide about 6 percent of its money, not all.
In addition, the chart misstated David L. Bernhardt's position at Interior. He is director of the office of Congressional and legislative affairs, not of the executive secretariat.

HEADLINE: You Can Beat City Hall (in Pay, Anyway); 
Deputy Mayors Discover Life After Giuliani, and It Can Be Sweet

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

 BODY:
As deputy mayors under Rudolph W. Giuliani, they were the inner circle of lieutenants, running perhaps the most centralized and iron- fisted municipal government in modern New York history. Now, back in the private sector, they have traded their deputy's badges for high-powered positions in law, finance, lobbying, telecommunications and, of course, Major League Baseball.
 Whether they left City Hall on Dec. 31 or months earlier, their return to private life has been an adjustment. Telephones have stopped ringing regularly in the dead of night. Children and spouses, long strangers, are familiar faces again. There is the deflating sense of no longer being crucial to the city's kinetic hum, as well as the loss of beloved perks. But there is also the possibility of new wealth. 
 While they must do without their chauffeured city cars, several of Mr. Giuliani's deputies are now earning several times more than the $168,700 a year that they were paid in government. One, Ninfa Segarra, has taken a pay cut to stay in public service as director of the city Police Museum, earning $115,000 a year, but others at high-powered law firms could earn more than $1 million annually. 
There is also a change in pace, the easing of the nonstop duties of public office and the demands of a boss, Mr. Giuliani, with little regard for sleep. "I joked that the first couple of days after the administration ended, I got a little angry at my 5-year-old for not showing up on time at the 8 o'clock staff meeting in my kitchen," said former Deputy Mayor Anthony P. Coles.
Joseph J. Lhota, the most recent deputy mayor for operations, who coordinated everything from the annual budget presentation to snowstorm cleanup efforts, said leaving government was a major life change, akin to graduating from school. "I do miss being in government," he said. "I also miss being in college. I still miss being in college. But life goes on." 
After a brief vacation in Mexico, Mr. Lhota accepted a job as an executive vice president at Cablevision Systems Corporation, in charge of the company's fiber-optics and telecommunications division as well as other departments, including payroll, personnel and real estate. He is also still a member of the City University board.
Several of Mr. Giuliani's deputies remain in important public positions. Ms. Segarra, the former deputy mayor for education and human services, is still president of the Board of Education. And Robert M. Harding, a former deputy mayor for economic development and finance, is a member of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, which is charged with rebuilding the World Trade Center site.
If history is a guide, serving as a deputy mayor is no guarantee of any particular fate. Some, like Kenneth Lipper, who served as deputy mayor for finance under Edward I. Koch, have been spectacularly successful. Mr. Lipper went on to found his own investment bank, wrote the novels "Wall Street" and "City Hall" and played a major role in producing the movie versions of both. 
And most deputy mayors tend to go on to distinguished careers. Nathan Leventhal, a deputy mayor for operations under Mr. Koch, went on to serve for 17 years as president of Lincoln Center. Richard R. Aurelio, a deputy mayor under John V. Lindsay, became president of Time Warner Cable of New York City and founded NY1, the 24-hour news channel. 
For the most part, Mr. Giuliani's deputies seem headed in similar directions. 
Mr. Harding, who also served as budget director and the city's chief lobbyist in Albany, is now a partner in the law firm of Greenberg Traurig in its governmental and administrative practice. He has opened an Albany office as part of the firm's effort to expand its lobbying operations, although conflict-of-interest laws will limit his dealings with New York City for a year.
Mr. Coles, the former deputy mayor for planning, education and cultural affairs, last week became a partner in the law firm of Arkin Kaplan & Cohen, founded by Stanley S. Arkin, the renowned white- collar criminal defense lawyer. Mr. Coles is also an executive vice president of the Arkin Group, an affiliated consulting firm, and writes a column for The New York Post.
After the administration ended, Mr. Coles had sought unsuccessfully to become president of Lincoln Center. As he searched for a new job, he took a weeklong skiing vacation with his wife and three children and moved the family into a new apartment on the Upper East Side. "What was possible is I could actually assist my wife in the move," he said. 
With Mr. Coles now signed on at a law firm, the only Giuliani deputy whose plans remain uncertain is Rudy Washington, the deputy mayor for business services and community development. Before joining city government, Mr. Washington owned a construction company. Former colleagues said he was exploring private ventures. He did not respond to requests for an interview.
Randy L. Levine, who was deputy mayor for economic development, planning and administration, is now president of the New York Yankees as well as senior counsel at the law firm of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld. Mr. Levine had served as Major League Baseball's chief labor negotiator and is a longtime associate of George M. Steinbrenner, the principal owner of the Yankees. 
Ms. Segarra, the Board of Education president, left City Hall to become a vice president for intercampus collaboration of the City University of New York, a new position that paid nearly $115,000 a year. The university's faculty union filed a request under the freedom-of-information law seeking copies of Ms. Segarra's date book, apparently in an effort to prove that she had a no-show job.
Ms. Segarra said the union singled her out because of its dislike for Mr. Giuliani. On Dec. 26, just five days before Mr. Giuliani left office, officials announced that Ms. Segarra had been chosen as executive director of the New York City Police Museum, and she resigned from CUNY. In an interview, she said the museum job was too good to decline. 
She said she believed in a public service career despite the pay. "I think I may be the only one whose income went down," Ms. Segarra said. She has also said that she will step down from the Board of Education when her term expires in June.
But even as most of them found well-paying jobs, not one deputy mayor joined Giuliani Partners, the private consulting firm that Mr. Giuliani founded with a loyal group of advisers after leaving office. This group includes two former chiefs of staff, the mayor's counsel and his corporation counsel, a police commissioner, a fire commissioner and a communications director. 
Sunny Mindel, the former communications director, who continues to work as Mr. Giuliani's spokeswoman, said: "The deputy mayors are pursuing their interests and continue to thrive." 
Several former officials in the Giuliani administration said that none of the deputy mayors had been asked to join the new company, which is affiliated with Ernst & Young, the giant accounting firm. Joining Mr. Giuliani in the consulting venture were two of his oldest and closest friends, Dennison Young Jr., his former counsel, and Michael Hess, the former corporation counsel. 
Both Mr. Young and Mr. Hess are former prosecutors who worked for Mr. Giuliani when he was a United States attorney. Also at Giuliani Partners are Anthony V. Carbonetti and Bruce Teitelbaum, the former chiefs of staff. These four men, together with Mr. Giuliani and Roy Bailey, a political supporter from Texas, are the equity partners in the new company. 
Mr. Giuliani's earning potential is enormous and is not dependent on the consulting firm. In addition to having a multimillion-dollar contract to write two books, he stands to make millions from paid speeches. Still, his partners are said to be making at least as much as many partners at major law firms, upward of $750,000 a year.
Some former deputy mayors have returned to lucrative careers. John S. Dyson, who was Mr. Giuliani's first deputy for finance and economic development, was a wealthy investor before joining city government. He is now chairman of Millbrook Capital Management, a hedge fund, and owns three wineries, Millbrook Vineyards in New York, Pebble Ridge Vineyards in California and Villa Pillo in Tuscany.
Another former operations deputy, Randy M. Mastro, left government in 1998 to return to Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, the law firm where he had previously worked. Mr. Mastro is now the co-partner in charge of the firm's New York office, as well as co-coordinator of the firm's litigation practice. The average partner at the firm earns about $1 million a year. 
And Peter J. Powers, a boyhood friend of Mr. Giuliani's who left his post as first deputy mayor in 1996, owns a business consulting firm, Powers Global Strategies. Mr. Powers, who insists he is a consultant, not a lobbyist, has drummed up millions of dollars in business from corporations doing business with New York City. Among his early clients was Michael R. Bloomberg. 
Others have had a bumpier road. Fran Reiter, who served in two deputy mayor posts -- planning and community relations and later finance and economic development -- left City Hall in December 1997 to become president of the New York City Convention and Visitors Bureau. She left that post to run for mayor last year and then became executive director of the Joseph Papp Public Theater. But after less than a year, Ms. Reiter quit the public theater post, saying the job was a bad fit.
Mr. Coles said that the deputy mayors who stayed until the very end of Mr. Giuliani's term had left with a sense of satisfaction at having changed the city, but also contentment because term limits meant they were not tossed out by voters. "Unlike a situation where the administration is voted out of office," he said. "This is something we knew was going to come to an end."

HEADLINE: THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 4-21-02: CLOSE READING: CHARITY; 
That's Rich

BYLINE:  By Nelson W. Aldrich Jr. 

 BODY:
It was a gift foretold. At least twice since he was elected, New York's billionaire mayor appealed to the civic spirit of his financial peers, asking them to help make up for the city's cuts in its arts' subsidies. He couldn't very well stint the performance of his own civic duty, and didn't. Just before tax time, we learned that he has hurled $10 million of his own money into the breach, for 137 cultural groups. 
 Civic spirit? Civic duty? That any rich American should conceive of this antique virtue, let alone act on it, seems preposterous. For 20 years we've witnessed -- hell, participated in -- the most egregious display of acquisitive individualism since the Gilded Age. Government, steward of the civic commons, bowed to our sociopathic sense of entitlement to our acquisitions with tax cut after tax cut, principally for the rich. If civic virtue survived this orgy, it had to be in the one form for which America offers fabulous inducements, from 40 cents back in tax savings on the donated dollar to membership in our new upper class (call it Benefit Society for its eponymous appearances in the Style sections of our local newspapers). 
 So what are the chances that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's example will be followed by other rich men and women? Not great, to judge by some numbers from NewTithing Group, a four-year-old San Francisco nonprofit that offers individuals educational materials on charitable giving. According to NewTithing, individuals and couples whose adjusted gross income is $1 million or more a year have investments worth, on average, about $18 million. NewTithing estimates that with reasonably clever deployment of the charitable deduction on income and appreciated assets, such a statistically average household could give away as much as $1 million a year and suffer no loss of capital. (Discretionary income would take a hit, of course, but still remain at 100 times what the average family plays around with.) And what does our statistical couple actually give each year? About $120,000.
To be fair, there are signs that a growing minority of the very rich are discovering the joys and powers of big-time giving. The same may soon be said of our mayor's bravest display of civic spirit, hurling his own person into public office. The purchasibility of such offices declined after the Gilded Age, when the United States Senate was a millionaires' club. Now, however, thanks to the reform of the campaign-financing laws, high office may soon be within the grasp of the entire high end of the wealth scale, producing a stupendous display of trickle-down economics. If our mayor is a success and appears to be having fun, there's some of his very rich peers will be leaping into electoral politics like dogs on a bone -- or, just possibly (remember T.R. and F.D.R.) like knights to the rescue.
As long as we cherish the fantasy that private fortunes need pay little or no civic duty -- e.g., death duties and other taxes -- to the democracy that made them possible, charitable giving and public service is the best we can expect of the civic spirit of the rich. Our mayor shows the way. Let us be grateful. Nelson W. Aldrich Jr.

HEADLINE: How Does AOL Fit in the GrandPlan Now? 

BYLINE:  This article was reported by Lorne Manly, Jim Rutenberg and Seth Schiesel, and was written by Mr. Schiesel.

 BODY:
STEPHEN M. CASE, Richard D. Parsons and Robert W. Pittman, the men at the helm of AOL Time Warner, do not yet agree on just how the America Online Internet service -- one of the company's biggest divisions -- should evolve or on just how quickly it can grow over the next few years.
 As Mr. Parsons, a renowned corporate diplomat, prepares to take over as AOL Time Warner's chief executive next month, forging that consensus is his most important challenge, and a vital one for the company, the world's largest media conglomerate. America Online's slowing growth over the last year and its failure to meet Wall Street expectations have been a drag on the company's shares. And the absence of a unified vision of America Online's future -- of just how the Internet can work with old media like movies to deliver vast new profits, as promised -- is raising questions anew about the wisdom of the merger that created the company two years ago, at the peak of the Internet bubble. 
 While Mr. Case, the company's chairman, Mr. Parsons and Mr. Pittman, the recently returned chief of America Online and the recently designated chief operating officer of AOL Time Warner, are not at one another's throats, they are also not yet agreed on a strategic and tactical plan for the Internet service. Mr. Case, the technology futurist, tends to see the future of America Online in new digital services and gadgets, while Mr. Pittman, the consummate marketer, hopes to build America Online as an advertising vehicle while milking older technologies like traditional Internet access as long as possible.
For his part, Mr. Parsons does not appear to have as strong a view as his colleagues on America Online's strategic direction, partly because he has not spent as much time at the Internet unit as have Mr. Case and Mr. Pittman.
"AOL has been concealing the growing pains that its flagship unit has been going through, and those struggles or challenges are now pretty obvious if you look at the financials," said Jordan E. Rohan, a media analyst at the SoundView Technology Group, an investment bank. "Nobody really knows if they can make AOL into a real media platform over a longer-term basis."
Moreover, some people close to AOL Time Warner say Mr. Parsons has a substantially more conservative assessment of America Online's growth rate than Mr. Case or Mr. Pittman. They say Mr. Parsons appears to believe that the unit can increase one key measure of cash flow -- earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda -- by perhaps 18 percent a year over the next five years, once the advertising market rebounds. Mr. Case and Mr. Pittman appear to lean closer to 25 percent.
Internal disagreement is not necessarily bad for a company, and it is possible that the three men will reach a consensus on America Online. For now, however, the absence of a consensus has prevented the company from giving investors -- or even its own employees -- a credible, detailed financial and strategic picture of where the company is headed and how it intends to get there.
That uncertainty has cost investors a lot of money. This year alone, the company's shares have lost almost 35 percent of their value, closing Friday at $20.93. That slide may be stemmed on Wednesday, when the company announces quarterly financial results, especially if it says it is on track to meet its financial targets for the year: to increase revenue by 5 percent to 8 percent and to lift its Ebitda by 8 percent to 12 percent.
"The issue at AOL Time Warner is that they have not been willing to give guidance by segment," said Tom Wolzien, a media analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, a research firm.
While America Online is not the only AOL Time Warner unit to struggle -- revenue at the company's music business actually fell 7.9 percent last year -- its problems are particularly worrisome to investors because it is in such a new industry. Despite the challenges posed by digital technology, the recorded music industry has been around for the better part of a century, and people know what it should look like. By contrast, the Internet as a commercial enterprise is about a decade old, and no one is sure where it is headed. The absence of a unified strategy at America Online emphasizes this uncertainty.
Mr. Case, the founder of America Online, has always seen the company's route to growth in extending new modes of communication to consumers. That vision has undergirded America Online's evolution.
With growth in the traditional Internet access business starting to level off, Mr. Case wants to expand America Online beyond bulky computers into new modes of interactive communication.
"Soon, televisions will come equipped with portals, and people will be able to bookmark their favorite programs like they bookmark their favorite Web sites," Mr. Case said in a speech last spring. "People will be able to store their music on servers in their homes or keep it in online jukeboxes they can carry with them. For the telephone, the distinction between long-distance and local calling will disappear -- and communications will be integrated with the TV and the PC. You might be trading instant messages with somebody and then decide to switch to voice -- and you'll do it quickly and easily and inexpensively."
It is in pursuing this vision of the digital home -- indeed, the digital life -- that Mr. Case appears to believe America Online will find its long-term growth.
Mr. Pittman does not seem to share that vision.
Two weeks ago, he replaced Barry Schuler as the chief executive of America Online. Mr. Schuler, a graphic designer, is enamored of gadgets and new technology and in some ways is just the man to try to make Mr. Case's vision a reality.
Mr. Pittman, by contrast, is all about marketing and advertising.
Days after taking Mr. Schuler's job, Mr. Pittman told America Online employees that the company had been distracted from its core mission by overemphasizing new technologies like interactive television. At the time, that was interpreted as a refutation of Mr. Schuler. It was also, however, a demarcation of a deep strategic difference with Mr. Case.
"Advertising, which remains soft in the entire media sector, is the challenge," Mr. Pittman wrote in an e-mail message to the unit's workers. "Getting this back on track is our highest priority."
THE strategies of Mr. Case and Mr. Pittman are not mutually exclusive. But in a world of finite resources, it remains to be seen where America Online's financial and human resources will be focused.
Whatever path America Online takes, and whatever growth targets it ultimately pursues, the unit will have to work more successfully with traditional Time Warner divisions than it has so far.
That relationship has not been a complete flop. With what Mr. Pittman has called the America Online "firehose" trained on Time Inc.'s Web sites, traffic has soared. For example, Time.com, attracted 5.9 million visitors in March, according to Jupiter Media Metrix, a research firm. Two years earlier, the site had only one million visitors.
The Internet unit has helped Time Inc. attract 100,000 new subscribers a month to its magazines and has also appeared to help Warner Brothers films.
Despite that success, AOL Time Warner has failed to fully deliver on its promises of synergy between old and new media, at least so far.
"The company presented things in a way where it was a story about the integration of traditional media content with new distribution channels, and it was intended to be revolutionary," said Lowell J. Singer, a media analyst at Robertson Stephens in San Francisco. "What we've learned is that all of that stuff takes a long time to happen."
Consider CNN Money. No one inside or outside AOL Time Warner really thought that cable channel would become a giant on the scale of Warner Brothers or Time Inc. But when the company's executives announced plans for the new venture in January 2001, just weeks after AOL Time Warner was created, they held it up as an example of how the company's far-flung television, magazine, Internet and cable television divisions would work together as a seamless whole.
It has not worked out as planned.
The idea was that CNNfn, the struggling, underexposed business-news channel, would be renamed CNN Money and given a personal-finance slant like that of Money, the Time Inc. magazine that was providing its name to the venture. Time Warner Cable would provide broader distribution, and the Web site of CNNfn would be combined with Money's.
America Online would also play a vital role. CNN Money would be integrated with America Online's personal finance section, with pop-up advertisements on the Internet service directing users to the Web site and the cable channel.
Nearly 15 months later, CNNfn remains a lagging business-news cable channel called CNNfn. The original target date for the debut of CNN Money has passed, and the company has set no new one. CNNfn can still be viewed in only about 19 million homes -- one-fourth as many as its main rival, CNBC. Even Time Warner Cable carries CNBC more broadly than CNNfn.
Time Inc.'s Money magazine merged its Web site with CNNfn's, increasing overall traffic. But Fortune magazine, whose content and promotional support were pledged to the reinvigorated network, recently announced a new program that will be shown not on CNNfn or even on CNN, but on PBS.
Lou Dobbs, the anchor and managing editor of CNN's "Moneyline" and one of AOL Time Warner's best-known television personalities, has also failed to perform all the synergistic feats that company executives promised.
When Mr. Dobbs returned to CNN last April after a dot-com hiatus, the executives then running the network said he would anchor a new CNNfn program, write regular columns for the Web site and play an important role in the development of CNN Money. Mr. Dobbs does write a column for Money magazine, but none of the other promises have been fulfilled.
AOL Time Warner executives said the shelving of CNN Money was a simple, clear-eyed reaction to the collapse of advertising in the business-news sector.
CNN Money is emblematic of the company's broader failure to fulfill much of the synergistic vision outlined in headier days. Mr. Case once predicted that AOL TV, an interactive television service, would "reinvent television." But AOL TV has attracted only about 100,000 customers.
Nonetheless, some of the company's once-estranged television fiefs are beginning to reconcile.
Jamie C. Kellner, chief executive of the company's WB broadcast network, now also runs the Turner cable networks and is forcing them to work more closely together. WB and the Cartoon Network now share programming, and TNT shows episodes of "Charmed," a drama series, five days after they are broadcast on WB.
Beyond magazines and television networks, the Time Warner division that was expected to dovetail most neatly with America Online was Time Warner Cable, the nation's No. 2 operator, behind AT&T.
In fact, it was probably the cable operation, with about 13 million subscribers, that most attracted America Online to Time Warner in the first place. Buying Time Warner could let America Online secure a beachhead for high-speed Internet service and use it to cudgel other cable companies into allowing America Online onto their systems.
AS with CNN Money, the cable coup has not worked out as planned.
At the end of 2001, the America Online Internet service had about 33.2 million subscribers. Of those, only about 400,000, or about 1.2 percent, were paying America Online for broadband service.
Moreover, of those 400,000, more than half are linked to the Internet over connections that AOL Time Warner leased from local phone companies, not cable lines. So, a year after America Online's acquisition of Time Warner was completed, the company had converted fewer than 200,000 of its 12.8 million cable customers into America Online broadband subscribers.
The problem is not that broadband is failing: using its own Road Runner brand, Time Warner Cable was serving almost two million cable modem customers at year-end. The issue is that the integration of America Online and the Time Warner cable television unit has yet to show significant synergy.
And there is an even bigger problem: America Online's failure to get its broadband service on any other major cable system, particularly AT&T Comcast.
Later this year, Comcast is expected to complete its deal to acquire AT&T's cable systems. After that, it is conceivable that the new cable behemoth would be open to providing America Online broadband service over its lines.
There is, of course, a catch -- in this case a $10 billion catch.
AT&T owns 25.5 percent of a venture called Time Warner Entertainment, which includes most of AOL Time Warner's cable systems. AOL owns the other 74.5 percent. AT&T's stake is generally considered to be worth at least $10 billion, and AT&T has been trying to sell it back to AOL for years, but AOL has seen no reason to write such a big check for a stake in a venture that it already controls.
Now that Comcast has agreed to take over AT&T's minority stake in the venture, AOL may have to write that check. According to people close to AT&T and Comcast, there is essentially no chance that AT&T or the forthcoming AT&T Comcast will agree to package America Online with its own cable modem service until AOL Time Warner comes up with the $10 billion or so for the Time Warner Entertainment stake.
Needless to say, AOL Time Warner does not have $10 billion, at least at the moment.
On Wall Street and within the media industry, the most provocative thought about AOL Time Warner these days is that the company should admit that the merger that created it -- the biggest merger in United States history -- was all a big mistake and split into two companies again: America Online and Time Warner.
After all, if America Online were independent, AT&T Comcast could not demand $10 billion from the Internet operation for the Time Warner Entertainment stake. In addition, the core Time Warner businesses seem to be doing reasonably well. Perhaps investors would value the Time Warner operations more richly if they were not confused and anxious about America Online.
While the company's top executives appear firmly opposed to the idea of a breakup, and there seems to be no ground swell among investors to pressure the company toward one, it is not necessarily a dead issue.
AT&T, after all, spent more than $80 billion in the 1990's buying up cable companies. Investors quickly lost patience with that strategy, and shortly afterward, in 2000, AT&T said it would spin off its cable operation (the one Comcast has agreed to buy).
The cliche is the same as the lesson: never say never.

HEADLINE: The Sports Market Is Looking Soggy 

BYLINE:  By JOHN D. SOLOMON

 BODY:
IT'S springtime, and the professional sports world seems to be in clover. After a season of record attendance, National Football League teams are spending much of what they took in, signing new players in the college draft this weekend. In the National Hockey League, where teams are dueling in playoffs, games also drew an unprecedented number of fans this year. Major League Baseball is bragging that corporate sponsorships are up 30 percent, and despite the worst advertising market in 30 years, the National Basketball Association signed a record $4.6 billion, six-year television contract in January.
 But other signs suggest that the four major league sports may, in fact, be wilting. 
 In recent months, advertisers, networks, cable operators and governments have started to balk at spending unlimited amounts on sports. The stadium building cycle is over. Team expansion has halted, and baseball may shrink by two teams. High ticket prices and labor unrest -- baseball players may well strike again this season -- have damaged the relationship with the public and led to an erosion of the fan base. And many in the younger generation seem more interested in spending their time and dollars in other pursuits -- sometimes playing video games about sports -- than in watching what happens on the field. 
"It was an oversaturated, mature market in a growth economy," said Rick Burton, the director of the Warsaw Sports Marketing Center at the University of Oregon. "It has taken this hiccup in the economy to recognize the saturation and maturity."
The April 8 bankruptcy filing by KirchMedia of Germany, attributable in part to its heavy spending on TV sports rights, raised only more worries -- perhaps dampening the willingness to spend money on sports in the United States.
"We have to market like we are under attack, which in reality we are," said Mark Cuban, the owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team and an Internet radio billionaire. "Every media and out-of-home entertainment business wants our customers." 
Professional sports has repeatedly shown a Michael Jordan-like ability to defy economic gravity -- the average resale value of major league teams in the last decade has nearly quintupled in football, tripled in hockey and baseball and more than doubled in basketball, says Moag & Company, a Baltimore investment bank that focuses on sports. Yet, like its famous player, the industry may now have to make some concessions to age.
Teams can no longer rely on network television contracts that will routinely double, or on average ticket price increases that have outpaced the Consumer Price Index.
Much of the dazzling growth in sports team revenue over the last two decades has come from the television networks' heavy spending on broadcast rights. In 1986, the four sports took in an average of $744 million in broadcast rights fees, according to Moag. That grew to $1.5 billion in 1991 and $3.5 billion last year.
But the networks are now an uncertain source of revenue. 
These days, even Rupert Murdoch -- a man who used an N.F.L. contract to build a fledgling Fox into the fourth network in 1994 -- is sounding a different note. After writing off $909 million in sports contracts in February, Mr. Murdoch, chairman of the News Corporation, which owns Fox, cautioned that rights fees "have gone beyond an economic level." 
A recent Morgan Stanley report called potential total losses from sports "staggering" and predicted that ABC, CBS and Fox would each lose up to $1.3 billion on sports rights over the next four years. It expects the three to lose $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion over the life of their eight-year, $18.3 billion N.F.L. contract rights. NBC, a unit of General Electric, has backed away from bidding on sports rights contracts because of their cost; For NBC, Morgan projects a deficit from sports, excluding the Olympics, of $351 million. The networks declined to comment on those estimates, but Viacom's CBS, for one, has said it is not losing money from sports.
SO far, the leagues remain confident. "That note has been sounded before: The rights fees will never go higher," said Greg Aiello, a spokesman for the N.F.L., "and they go higher." 
History, of course, backs him up. As Yogi Berra might say, TV sports contracts are such a bad deal, there always seems to be someone who wants them. 
Paul Tagliabue, the N.F.L. commissioner, said he expected that the league would keep "the mass" of games on broadcast television when the next contract comes up in 2006.
But whether the league can do so, and get anywhere near the 100 percent increase it received last time, is unclear at best. The N.B.A.'s new contract with ESPN and ABC of Walt Disney and with Turner Sports of AOL Time Warner may be a harbinger. The rights increase was more modest -- 25 percent -- and will put 127 games on basic cable next year, compared with 79 this year. The N.B.A. will also put 96 games on a planned N.B.A.-AOL cable channel. The games broadcast on network television will drop to 15 from 30.
Though cable's combination of subscriber fees and advertising may provide a more lucrative and reliable revenue stream than broadcast TV rights fees, it has presented sports with a new risk -- fewer people may watch, particularly if they have to pay. "The economic underpinning of pro sports has been free television," said a longtime sports executive who spoke on condition of anonymity. Sports team owners, he said, "risk marginalizing the sport by moving it off broadcast." 
David Stern, the N.B.A. commissioner, is not worried about the shift to cable because many people already get their sports that way. He points out that 84 percent of Americans have cable or satellite service. "We understand that the viewing habits of our fans have changed dramatically," he said. 
But how much cable subscribers will be willing to pay for sports is unknown, as seen in a battle royal in New York in the past few months between Cablevision Systems, the largest cable operator in the metropolitan area, and the New York Yankees. Cablevision has refused to pay the team's new Yankees Entertainment and Sports Network, or YES, $72 million -- or $2 a subscriber a month -- and include it in the basic package. The fight may foreshadow more such disputes. 
"I think we could be getting to the breaking point," said Jerald L. Kent, co-founder and former chief executive of Charter Communications, a cable operator. He said that if cable companies included such costs in the monthly bill, "consumers are not going to continue to pay, particularly those who aren't watching sports."
Cablevision has offered to sell YES, which is carrying 130 Yankee games this season, only to subscribers who want it, the way it markets HBO and other premium channels.
But questions about a pay-TV future for sports have also been raised by recent events abroad. 
KirchMedia just defaulted on its $329 million annual rights fee to the Bundesliga soccer league in Germany because it could not sign up enough customers to cover the contracts. In Britain, ITV Digital, a pay-television venture owned by Granada and Carlton Communications, could not pay a $450 million soccer contract. In South America, the Pan American Sports Network filed for bankruptcy protection March 1 for similar reasons.
The fallout from the YES-Cablevision confrontation, however, has also underscored the strength of sports as programming. In areas where the Yankees have been blacked out, DirecTV satellite service sales have risen more than 20 percent, said Bob Marsocci, a DirecTV spokesman. "Sports fans are our most loyal customers," he said.
Sports industry leaders, meanwhile, point out that sports content helped launch some of the country's first cable systems and is a major reason consumers buy satellite service. "The one thing we have learned is that sports drives new technology," said Mark Lazarus, president of Turner Sports. "That trend will continue given its live nature and the fanaticism of viewers. Their appetite will lead the way. Is it Internet? Pay per view? We don't know. But sports will be the driver."
THE changes in sports distribution, however, have not been lost on advertisers. Many are taking a hard look at how much they will pay to pitch products in a more splintered marketplace.
According to Anheuser-Busch, the biggest spender on sports advertising, the leagues and networks have not fully adjusted their expectations on advertising, thinking they deserve the same premium even if ratings are falling. "We are concerned with the cost relative to the return that we get from sports," said Tony Ponturo, Anheuser-Busch's vice president for global media and sports marketing. "We are telling the leagues and networks we won't automatically underwrite you as you drive up the costs. We're only going to pay what you deliver."
Viewership for all four sports has droped -- the N.F.L., the highest-rated TV sport, has suffered a 13 percent drop in ratings over the last five years, according to Nielsen Media Research. ESPN is profitable, but Nielsen says that the percentage of homes watching it has fallen to 1.9 percent of those with access, from 2.6 percent 10 years ago.
Despite the falling ratings, league officials say the multichannel landscape makes sports more valuable for advertising, particularly because sports attracts the young male audience many advertisers desire. "Sports is unique," said Tim Brosnan, executive vice president for business at Major League Baseball. "It's the only place that aggregates viewers. Everything else is a one-trick pony."
To Ted Leonsis, an owner of the Washington Wizards basketball team and Washington Capitals hockey team, sports programming is also the best defense against technology that lets viewers screen out ads and watch what they want whenever they want: "In a world with 900 channels and TiVo, no one wanted to tape the Super Bowl," he said. "They wanted to watch it live."
But in a sign that the sports business is worried about alienating advertisers, it is giving them more ways to advertise. "Sponsors are pushing harder," said John Galloway, Pepsi's sports marketing director. "And leagues are working harder to add value and measurable results." Major League Baseball, for example, let Pepsi sponsor the first pitch of each World Series game last year. Team sports may thus move closer to a European sponsorship model, where commercials are everywhere -- corporate logos on team uniforms, for example.
Other affiliations, like stadium naming, are going through an overdue market correction, said David M. Carter, the founder and principal of the Sports Business Group, a consulting firm in Los Angeles. Enron Field, the TWA Dome and PsiNet Stadium are a few examples of questionable spending by financially troubled businesses. And some arenas cannot find sponsors with deep pockets. The Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans, for example, which has been trying to sell naming rights for $3 million to $5 million, just cut the price to $2 million to $2.5 million. "This shakeout is forcing business to qualify and quantify why they are in sports," he said. "Companies were not applying the same rational business decision-making process."
The sports industry will have to do without the sizzle and revenue spike of new stadiums themselves, which have been a growth engine the past two decades. Almost three-fourths of major professional teams already have a new home or one in the pipeline, said John A. Moag Jr., the chief executive of Moag & Company. In New York, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's decision to delay indefinitely development of two new baseball stadiums underscores the public sector's reluctance to finance any more.
That means teams will have to find ways to squeeze new revenue from existing facilities. For example, the Southwest Sports Group, the Dallas sports and entertainment company that owns the Texas Rangers, and the Anschutz Entertainment Group, owner of the Los Angeles Kings, are planning to use their arenas as anchors for major real estate and entertainment developments.
Another part of the sports boom -- expansion within leagues -- has also run its course. After the new Houston Texans kick off this fall in the N.F.L., no major league sport plans to open new franchises in the United States anytime soon.
An underlying problem is that customers are just less interested; many are alienated by the huge salaries and boorish behavior of some players. The ESPN Sports Poll, a periodic fan survey, has found that over the last five years, the fan base of all four major team sports has dropped at least 5 percent and that significantly fewer fans describe themselves as "avid." Further, sports' share of the licensing products business slipped to 16 percent from 19 percent from 1996 to 2000, according to the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association.
Stemming the erosion is particularly important among the younger crowd, which has many more recreation choices -- from X Games to Xbox. "A whole generation is having more fun playing John Madden electronically than watching him on television," said Mr. Burton at the University of Oregon.
Richard Luker, president of the Leisure Intelligence Group, a sports consulting firm in East Lansing, Mich., called the failure to attract young new fans a "demographic crisis for the sports business."
Teams hope technological innovations will add to enthusiasm. For example, Gary Bettman, the N.H.L. commissioner, said high-definition television would provide a better view of hockey's fast action.
Many in the business are also concerned about the economic demographics of fans who attend games. "If the prices only allow 5 percent of the public to have that live experience, aren't you going to lose the other 95 percent?" asked Timothy J. Leiweke, the president of the Anschutz Entertainment Group. "That's very, very dangerous for sports."
Since 1997, each of the major sports has lost more than 7 percent of its fan base earning $30,000 or less, according to ESPN, while the number of fans earning at least $100,000 is up at least 30 percent. 
Ticket price inflation has slowed -- and in basketball this year, the average ticket price fell 2.3 percent, according to the Team Marketing Report, a research group in Chicago. But to Mr. Leiweke, a more fundamental change may be needed. "The owners and players are going to have to sit down and figure out how to solve this," he said.
That means, for one, that management and labor must agree on a cost structure that keeps the playing field profitable for teams and level for the leagues. Collective bargaining agreements that link labor costs to revenue explain why N.F.L. franchises are largely in the black, and why the N.B.A. will break even this year after several years of losses. Yet, despite record revenue, the hockey and baseball leagues lack such links and many teams are losing money. 
Jay Cross, the president of the New York Jets, said: "Sports may have to make a significant change in the model. And since so many people have to buy into the change, it might not be that easy."
TEAM sports is the rare industry where the stronger businesses require healthy competitors, but maintaining that balance is hard when owners have different financial capacities and expectations.
Robert J. Tilliss, head of the global sports advisory group at J. P. Morgan Chase, says he is bullish on the industry because it attracts successful entrepreneurs like Mr. Cuban and Mr. Leonsis. But their aggressiveness has another side. "It is a fundamental problem that the best interest of individual owners is not always in the best interest of the league," Mr. Tilliss said.
Even in the N.F.L., viewed as the model of revenue sharing among teams, Robert Tisch, a co-owner of the New York Giants, has expressed concern that the Washington Redskins' nonshared cash flow from their new stadium puts his team at a competitive disadvantage. Financial balance among the teams gives all teams an equal chance to win. That has helped create football's connection with the public and has ultimately made the business successful. 
As Jerry Jones, owner of the Dallas Cowboys, said at a recent conference: "They only throw ticker-tape parades for war heroes, astronauts and people who win ballgames."

HEADLINE: After an Age of Digital Hubris, Wired'sEditor Is Still a Believer 

BYLINE:  By DAVID CARR 

 BODY:
You do not need a magazine like Wired to tell you that the future has become a more complicated, less optimistic place. The biggest status symbol in Silicon Valley right now is a job. The digital story is kaput, at least for the time being, and dozens of mainstream publications are competing for news that Wired used to have all to itself.
 In the midst of the free fall, Chris Anderson took over the helm of the magazine, one of the digital revolution's most cherished tribal artifacts. And precisely because he was not a member of the tribe -- he arrived from The Economist -- he has been fighting for custody of its soul ever since. 
 Cable modems and listservs have been crackling with umbrage since Mr. Anderson came out of nowhere -- he was hardly on anyone's short list save that of the editorial director of Conde Nast, James Truman -- and he has been under quiet attack from the digerati ever since he took over in June. Privately, they point to his lack of Silicon Valley credentials and his decision to replace several longtime editors. Compounding the cultural war and creating fodder for his critics, newsstand sales for the magazine were off 31.5 percent in the second half of last year. 
The disappearance of technology ads has hit Wired harder than almost any other magazine and has prompted whispers that Mr. Anderson's own future as editor of the so-called "postcard from the future" was limited. In the first quarter of this year, Wired's ad revenue was down a breathtaking 58.57 percent compared with the same month last year.
Officials at Conde Nast say they are firmly behind Mr. Anderson, 40, despite the turmoil, if for no other reason than that S. I. Newhouse Jr., the owner of the parent company, Advance Publications, is among Wired's ferociously loyal readers. Both Mr. Truman and Mr. Newhouse have been much more involved in Wired than in the past, but Mr. Anderson, an optimist as only the truly technology-minded can be, sees no reason to worry about his own future or Wired.
"This isn't the domain of techies anymore," Mr. Anderson said. "It has gone mainstream in a way that doesn't diminish its power, but illustrates it."
Where other people see an imploded technology market, a skeptical core audience and persistent future fatigue, Mr. Anderson sees endless scenarios of change and growth. Wired has again been nominated for a National Magazine Award for General Excellence. He and Darrin Perry, who designed ESPN the Magazine, will introduce a redesign in June that they believe will bring both dynamism and coherence to Wired's traditional riot of fluorescent typography.
The redesign will not quiet the drums of discontent resounding through Silicon Valley. Few would speak on the record, and those who will choose their words very judiciously.
"Like many people, I am waiting for the full expression of his editorial philosophy," said John Battelle, a former editor at Wired and the chief executive of the defunct Industry Standard.
The angst in the valley has not had much of an impact at Conde Nast headquarters at 42nd Street and Broadway.
"It's a rich irony that a magazine about change has a following of loyalists who want it to remain forever the same," said Mr. Truman, the Conde Nast editorial director. "If they go away that's fine: I'm more interested in the next generation of Wired readers."
The presence of Wired, which is based in San Francisco, at Conde Nast, the least digitally engaged of all the major New York publishing houses, has always seemed anomalous. But Mr. Newhouse has been fascinated by the magazine since before he bought it in 1998 -- the company had a small minority stake early on. Mr. Truman says that Wired is hardly the goofy tech cousin in a fashion-conscious family.
"It's very limiting to suggest that we only do a certain sort of magazine," Mr. Truman said. "Conde Nast wants to own the magazine that is the dominant magazine in that category -- at the time there still was a category -- and Wired was the dominant magazine and still is."
He added that the magazine's relatively small circulation did not prevent it from bringing "millions and millions" to the company's bottom line during the boom years. He expects that Mr. Anderson will see it through to the next rise of the West Coast economy.
"I liked Chris's background, I liked his interests," Mr. Truman said. "I liked that he had been trained as a scientist and that he played bass in a New Wave band and was a bike messenger in Washington. He is truly a techno-freak, immersed in the culture of video games with a constellation of perspectives that is a little bit geeky and little bit rock 'n roll."
Mr. Anderson says his interest in the libretto of an unfolding technological revolution is relatively ancient. 
"I think it helps that I am a member of this revolution," said Mr. Anderson. "I was a subscriber from the second issue of Wired and completely bought into their world view." He points out that he has spent most of his career covering technology and his house is a small temple to digital living. He plays electronic games relentlessly, has wireless connectivity throughout his house and is conversant in music that reflects the back beat of technology.
Nibbling on lunch in a banquette in the Conde Nast cafeteria, he explains why Moby, a D.J. mainstream enough to be used as a soundtrack on several car commercials, is the perfect Wired cover subject for the May issue. He talked of the profound impact of Moby's "network effects" -- taking dance-club music to millions by way of Madison Avenue -- in a deepening digital revolution. (As he held forth, a very thin woman nearby was yelling into a cellphone that "those shoes better be here for the photo shoot.")
"I think that the way Moby has marketed himself, licensing every track, being both hip and ubiquitous is unique," Mr. Anderson said. He expounds for several minutes on the excellence of the article, but he has to open the magazine to recall who wrote it. Therein lies the problem to many of the members of the Wired tribe.
Some people who work with him say Mr. Anderson has managed to offend just by being himself, a big-idea guy with little facility for the kind of human interactions that magazines grow out of. After he got the job, his visits with some the magazine's longtime writers -- the elders of Silicon Valley -- came off as more of a lecture tour, with many offended by Mr. Anderson's willingness to filibuster. But other Wired employees say he is capable of listening and wants the magazine to reflect its founding DNA.
If the magazine is not exciting, it could be that the story it is covering is not producing the kind of heroes it once did. At its worst, critics say, Wired can seem dry, like The Economist without the thoughtfulness, but it is still not short on opinions. In the May issue, the writer Brian Alexander stepped up to the subject of eugenics and suggested that the debate had already been fundamentally settled: "The question isn't 'Should we have eugenics?' but rather, 'How far should we go?' "
For nine years, Wired has served as a telegram from the future, sometimes full of portent, often full of hyperbole, but it has been the closest the publishing community has come to putting a what's-next sensibility between glossy covers. Wired was christened as a quasi-religious movement when it was begun by Louis Rossetto and Jane Metcalfe. Wired helped erect the future and sought to make its readers feel that they owned it.
In the boom years, the journalistic narrative and the marketing plan nearly wrote themselves, but mainstream reporters, many schooled by Wired's prescient coverage, eventually began competing for new-economy stories.
Mr. Newhouse's reported instructions to make Wired relevant has reduced the editorial randomness that made the magazine seem as if it had just landed from a far-flung, but interesting, planet, but it has also reduced the metabolism of the assignments.
The newly redesigned June issue will have Steven Spielberg, not exactly a harbinger of edginess, on the cover. Kite surfing, a phenomenon that has been on television for the past two years, is pitched as "the new extreme sport that will blow you away" on the April cover. It may be extreme, but it is not new, and the shock of the new has always driven Wired.
Mr. Anderson's predecessor, Katrina Heron, has had the experience of taking over Wired from a storied editor (Mr. Rossetto) and is not prepared to make any judgments about the person following her. She does have strong opinions about the continued salience of the magazine he edits. "I really believe that it is more important than ever that a magazine like Wired exists," Ms. Heron said. "This is still a very hot story."
John Heilemann, a frequent contributor under Ms. Heron, suggests she left a rather large footprint.
"Wired has always been more than a magazine -- it's a symbol, a culture, and a community rolled into one," Mr. Heilemann said. "Katrina was brilliant at satisfying all the Wired constituencies while producing a book that was remarkably accessible and engaging to outsiders. Even for a really experienced, savvy editor, she'd be a tough act to follow."
So are the 90's.
"The big problem is that Wired arose on a general utopian wave of a kind we hadn't seen in 30 years," said Kurt Andersen, author of the novel "Turn of the Century" and co-founder of Inside.com, the defunct media news site. "That kind of wave probably only happens once a generation at best."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
New chairman of trade group calls for improving the value of the product that agencies sell.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

DATELINE: DANA POINT, Calif. 

 BODY:
MADISON AVENUE heard more tough talk, challenging the industry to remake itself to reach higher, as the 2002 Management Conference of the American Association of Advertising Agencies concluded.
 The speeches at the conference, which was the 84th annual meeting of the association, were virtually free of the frothy self-congratulation and back-patting that frequently takes place at industry gatherings. Rather, the top executives who addressed the general sessions before the conference ended Saturday spoke plainly and directly about the problems that confront agencies as they grapple with the continued downturn in advertising spending by clients. 
 "The pressure is on us as agency leaders," said Ken Kaess, whose term as the 2002-3 chairman of the association, known as the Four A's, began with the conference. "Are we ready to -- dare I say it -- take the lead?" he asked. "Or have we grown so comfortable with our position in the back seat of the marketing partnership that we've forgotten how to drive?" 
Mr. Kaess, who is also the president and chief executive at DDB Worldwide in New York, part of the Omnicom Group, warned: "I know one course of action we can't afford to consider. We can't just sit back and wait for the sky to fall on us."
Mr. Kaess, whose agency works for advertisers like Anheuser-Busch, Hershey Foods, Clorox, the New York Lottery and State Farm Insurance, urged in his speech on Friday that his colleagues, counterparts and competitors unite in a sustained effort to reverse a long-term trend that has resulted in "clients paying us even less for the very marketing and consumer insights they need more than ever."
"Talk about flunking Advertising/Marketing 101," he added with some scorn and frustration. "We can't sell a product clients desperately need and ostensibly want."
One answer, Mr. Kaess suggested, would be for the association to depart significantly from its tradition of allowing each chairman or chairwoman during the usual one-year term in office to advocate an issue of his or her own choosing. Those issues have ranged in recent years from reforming political advertising to championing creative excellence to exploring how to make advertising more effective.
"Should we be stepping back and looking at our industry and doing, say, a three-year strategic plan?" Mr. Kaess asked. "Isn't taking the long view what we would counsel our clients to do?"
The issue that Mr. Kaess recommended concentrating on for the next three years is "improving the value of the product we sell" by reminding marketers of "the transformational quality of great brand-building ideas and brand-communication programs."
That could be accomplished, Mr. Kaess said, by taking steps that would include "funding a major research study that helps quantify the value of what we do" and surveying advertisers annually, perhaps in conjunction with a major media company, to determine "where we are falling short" in meeting their needs.
"If we could achieve this one goal, increasing the value of our product, wouldn't clients be willing to pay more for a product they valued more?" Mr. Kaess asked. "We have research that says consumers do.
"Wouldn't more young people flock to our business if they knew the world appreciated its value?" he added, referring to the struggle most agencies are having recruiting entry-level employees, even in a soft economy. "Wouldn't it be more fun to walk into meetings and have clients awaiting our exciting new ideas and campaigns because they actually believed our product had the power to energize their brands?"
When Mr. Kaess finished his speech, he received loud, sustained applause, about as much as was heard Thursday after the frank, provocative remarks from Brendan Ryan, the 2001-2 chairman of the association.
As if that one-two punch was not sufficient, another top executive who spoke Friday echoed the proposal of Mr. Kaess to lift the industry by rethinking its emphasis.
"We're in the idea business," said John J. Dooner Jr., chairman, president and chief executive at the Interpublic Group of Companies in New York, the world's second-largest agency company with holdings like the McCann-Erickson World Group and Initiative Media Worldwide. "Our sole purpose is to build value for clients' businesses and their brands."
One crucial element, Mr. Dooner said, will be the ability of the giant agency companies like Interpublic, Omnicom and the WPP Group to effectively offer their disparate advertising and marketing services in cohesive, coordinated fashion. "We're a long way from doing it in the manner it requires," he said.
"This is where the game is going," he said, adding that "the one that gets this right wins the game."
"What we have to do during this economically challenged time is very vital -- focusing and refocusing and refocusing on the fundamentals," Mr. Dooner said, which, he added, comes down to "doing good work and getting fairly paid for it."

HEADLINE: Poor Showing For Oxygen In Ratings 

BYLINE:  By JIM RUTENBERG 

 BODY:
Executives at Oxygen, the cable network that promised to revolutionize television for women when it made its debut two years ago, have taken issue with smart-alecky assessments that it is "gasping for air."
 But the network -- whose founders include the Nickelodeon pioneer Geraldine Laybourne and Oprah Winfrey -- does seem to be gasping for ratings. And if the revolution is indeed being televised, very few people are watching. 
 Monthly data available from Nielsen Media Research for the first time in Oxygen's history show results far below what its executives -- and industry analysts -- expected when the network began in early 2000. 
According to March Nielsen figures, Oxygen is watched each day in an average of only 26,000 households, less than 0.1 percent of the nearly 40 million households that receive it nationwide.
In the evenings, its ratings are slightly better, and an average of 52,000 households tune in. But Oxygen still ranks among the lowest of the regularly monitored television networks, far below cable outlets like the Travel Channel and Country Music Television.
Oxygen's troubled start has by now been fairly well documented. Its initial program schedule, which included an amateurish "Pajama Party" talk show and an au courant (some said forced) afternoon show for teenagers, "Trackers," was widely panned.
Getting distribution on cable systems took longer than expected, particularly in New York. And the pricey gambit of fully integrating its television programming with the Internet all but fizzled when Oxygen was forced to close several sites and backtrack from its ambitious e-commerce goals.
But the Nielsen figures provide the first official scorecard of how audiences are taking to its programming. The miniscule audience numbers were surprising to long-time television industry analysts. "Barely a heartbeat -- if it was any lower it would be a hash mark," said one; Another said the network's viewership "hardly registers a ripple in the pond."
The ratings struggles of Oxygen, they said, underscore the difficulty that new cable networks face in breaking through to audiences -- especially without the promotional backing of a major media parent like Viacom or AOL Time Warner. But they also raise questions about whether there is room for another women's cable network in a field dominated by Lifetime, a joint venture of the Walt Disney Company and the Hearst Corporation.
Oxygen's wobbly start comes as such a surprise because so much was expected of the network. Promising to offer intelligent and thoughtful programming for professional women, in contrast to the more breathless Lifetime, its parent company, Oxygen Media, attracted financing of a reported $300 million from backers like AOL, Paul Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft, and the Carsey-Werner-Mandabach production house. The network went so far as to demand that cable operators pay to carry it, in an industry where most newcomers have to pay for carriage.
Oxygen executives acknowledged that they were disappointed with the ratings.
"We certainly had hoped we'd do better," said Laura Nelson, a network spokeswoman. But, she said, network executives were not discouraged. "We're absolutely right on track."
Ms. Nelson blamed the network's growth spurt in distribution for much of the problem. Oxygen was available in 14 million homes at the beginning of 2001. It now reaches nearly 40 million households, too many to continue without signing up for Nielsen ratings, which it did before the network's promotional campaign had shown results. "There's just a lag time between when you hit someone's dial and when they find you," Ms. Nelson said.
In two of the markets that have carried Oxygen the longest, Atlanta and Dallas, it is doing much better, Ms. Nelson said. It was recently added to Time Warner Cable's basic cable lineup in New York and the network hopes that the increased exposure will help increase the network's profile in the media. 
Ms. Nelson said the network saw no reason to change from its newly revamped programming schedule, which has moved away some from in-studio seemingly Oprah-inspired shows toward more humor and mainstream entertainment in the form of reruns of "Xena, Warrior Princess," and original new programs including a talk show about fashion with the comedian Tracey Ullman as host ("Pajama Party" has been dropped). "I think we're pretty confident in the quality of programming that's on the air," Ms. Nelson. "We're beginning to hit our stride."
Oxygen certainly has a way to go. According to the Nielsen data, its household ratings during prime time translate into just 63,000 people, only 19,000 of whom were women 18 to 49, Oxygen's key demographic.
Lifetime, on the other hand, was watched in prime time in March by 2.4 million people, 713,000 of them women 18 to 49. Lifetime is a much more established network, available in more than 85 million homes. It ranks No. 1 in prime time among all basic cable networks.
Yet Oxygen is not doing quite as well as Disney's SoapNet, which shows reruns of soap operas; it started about the same time as Oxygen. It is available in slightly more than half as many homes as is Oxygen, but is watched in a much higher percentage of them. Still, it did not receive anywhere near the amount of media attention that Oxygen did at its start.
Analysts said Oxygen, unlike SoapNet, is trying something much more ambitious by creating its own programming, which takes time. And despite its troubled start, they were not nearly ready to count it out.
"I think they're putting pretty good stuff on the air," said Christopher Geraci, director of national television buying for the OMD USA, a media services division of Omnicom. "This is just a testament to how hard it is to get noticed."
Mr. Geraci said that while he had expected a higher number of viewers, he believed sponsors would continue to stick with the network. "Most of the folks who have bought them have done so to be there at the beginning, so if it does turn out to be successful they will have laid a base with them," he said.
Jack Myers, editor of the Jack Myers Report, a television industry newsletter, said Oxygen was headed in the right direction by retooling its programming. And, he said, once it gets better notices it should do fine.
He disagreed with assessments that the women's television genre was overcrowded and said there seemed to be room for Lifetime and its spinoffs, the Lifetime Movie Network and Real Women, SoapNet, Rainbow Media Holding's WE Women's Entertainment and Oxygen.
"The real issue is going to be once they launch their new season and new schedule in September," he said. If Oxygen's ratings do not improve within a year, he said, "Then there's real concern. But I think that critics need to give them the next year before judgments start being finalized."

Andersen Said to Have Had Hint of Problems in August

Japan Slow to Accept New Phones
Nearly 60 percent of the Japanese own cellphones, but they are not rushing to embrace the so-called third-generation service.

HEADLINE: Actors Guild Vote on Agents Leaves Old System in Chaos 

BYLINE:  By ANITA M. BUSCH 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, April 21 

 BODY:
The defeat on Friday of a Screen Actors Guild proposal that would have eased restrictions on talent agencies has thrust agents and actors into a period of uncertainty not experienced in Hollywood in more than 60 years.
 The referendum, backed by a majority of the union's board but rejected by 54.5 percent of the members who voted, would have allowed production companies -- but not the major studios or networks -- to buy as much as 20 percent of talent agencies. The referendum also would have permitted a talent agency to own up to 20 percent of a production company, including advertising agencies. In addition, the deal would have allowed agents to take commissions on residual payments for home video and DVD releases. 
 As a result of the vote, agents go to work this week for the first time since 1939 without any oversight or restrictions from the guild.
Minutes after the deal was rejected, the Association of Talent Agents seized the opportunity to send a letter threatening legal action if the union tried "to create chaos by interfering with the relationship between agents and actors."
The letter also accused the guild of violating its own rules by allowing actors to use managers, who do not adhere to union rules, to negotiate deals. In California, managers are prohibited both by law and the actors union from negotiating deals, but many do so.
In response, the guild's national board suspended its own rule requiring that actors deal only with "franchised agents," meaning that actors can keep working with their agents while the union continues "a variety of options to ensure protection for performers."
At the same time, however, the board advised actors not to sign individual representation deals if the terms provide less protection than the guild rules and regulations that had been in effect. In addition, it will urge agents to re-sign the old franchise agreement, which agents today said they would not do.
The union's leaders were addressing the members today, and the Association of Talent Agents gathered for an impromptu meeting.
The controversial referendum divided an already splintered union, with actors like Jason Alexander, Rob Schneider and Elliott Gould opposing the proposal and Annette Bening, Kevin Spacey and many others supporting it. Even the guild's past leadership was split, with a pair of former presidents, Patty Duke and Richard Masur, supporting the deal while Charlton Heston and William Daniels rallied against it. The current president, Melissa Gilbert, voted for the referendum.
Proponents of the referendum said it was needed to keep peace between actors and their agents who feel economically stifled. Opponents of the plan contended it would create conflicts of interest, arguing that if a talent agency was owned by a production company, an actor's agent could also, in effect, be an employer.
The defeat of the proposal has frustrated and angered agents, who have tried for more than two years to reach an agreement with the fractious union. The threat of legal action after the defeat of the vote has only added to the ill will. One commercial actor called it "a bullying tactic."
Agents began talking about changing the guild's rules and restrictions, known as the "master franchise agreement," in 1999, saying that they needed parity with managers.
While both represent actors, talent agencies' business practices are much more restricted. Management companies reap lucrative producing fees and can own -- and be owned -- by production companies. Managers, in their defense, note that while talent agents cannot collect producing fees, they can take lucrative packaging fees for pulling together projects for studios. Managers cannot take such fees.
Last fall, in testimony before the California Legislature, talent agents surprisingly changed their focus and said that they did not care about managers. Instead, they argued that the union's restrictions were antiquated and thwarted their efforts to expand. The master franchise agreement has not changed significantly in more than 50 years.
In the last few years, several major advertising agency companies have held talks with talent agencies about investments and acquisitions, but backed off because of the restrictive union rules. In 1997, Interpublic agreed to buy a majority stake in Addis/Weschler, a management and production company now called Industry Entertainment, in a deal worth about $25 million.
That deal made agents realize the worth of their own agencies. Agents have told actors repeatedly that they do not want to be producers, they just want access to capital to expand their businesses, which in turn would create more jobs for their clients.
"They really don't have a desire to produce," said Gavin Polone, a producer who has been an agent, a manager, holds a Screen Actors Guild card and voted for the referendum. "The real issue is that a lot of the value of an agency is its assets and they want to find a way to cash out those receivables and sell their agency so they can get a long-term capital gain for tax purposes, which means selling an interest in their agency to another company." Ad agency executives agreed with that assessment.
Agents contend that while some talent firms may want to sell, the real reason to make the change is to build strategic relationships that would benefit their clients. They also argue that selling a stake of 20 percent is not the same as cashing out.
A deal negotiated, and approved, by the board of the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists is expected to be endorsed by the agents on Tuesday. If approved, all agents and some Screen Actors Guild members will be bound by a three-year contract that allows up to a 20 percent investment by production companies. A little less than half of the 98,000 guild members are also members of the federation, which covers only a small fraction of film and television work. 
"The fact that these agents will be adhering to our restrictions will help prevent conflict of interests," said Greg Hessinger, national executive director of the federation. 
Norm Aladjem, the chairman and chief executive of Writers and Artists Agency, said: "All of us have to find a way out. It's like the Middle East. As Benjamin Franklin once said, 'We must all hang together, or assuredly we shall all hang separately.' "

HEADLINE: World Bank Aims to Help Poor Receive Elementary Education 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 21 

 BODY:
Calling education crucial to the reduction of global poverty, international finance ministers approved a World Bank plan today aimed at enrolling all young children in elementary school.
 As a start, 10 poor nations that have been making progress on education recently could receive about $1 billion in combined aid to carry out strategies they devise. Bangladesh and Tanzania are considered likely recipients. 
 Even as World Bank officials praised wealthy nations for saying they would finance the plan, the officials acknowledged that they were unlikely to reach their goal of providing schooling for all children between 5 and 11 by the year 2015. 
About 125 million children in that age group, or about one of five in poor nations, do not attend school. More than three-quarters live in Africa or South Asia, the bank said.
Education occupied much of the discussion of the final day of the meetings of the bank and the International Monetary Fund in Washington this week.
On a rainy day, the meetings were not much affected by the protesters who have made it a routine to disrupt them. James D. Wolfensohn, the World Bank president, said he was pleased that this year most of the demonstrators were focusing on political issues that had little to do with the bank. He added that the bank had become more open and more responsive to its critics in the last five years and that he had met with some of those critics in the last week.
As they had throughout the weekend, ministers and development officials continued to criticize the Bush administration's recent decision to levy new tariffs on imported steel to protect the American steel industry.
Many economists believe that tariffs and subsidies in the United States and Europe and in other wealthy countries are hampering developing countries and raising prices for businesses and consumers around the world.
"Openness of trade is a necessity if you're going to deal with the question of development," said Mr. Wolfensohn. American and European officials also continued to disagree over whether loans or grants are a better way to deliver foreign aid. Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill has said that grants are a more honest way to give aid, because many loans to poor countries are never repaid. Some Europeans are concerned that a shift to grants will lead to smaller amounts of aid from wealthy countries.
Trevor Manuel, the finance minister of South Africa and the chairman of the World Bank's development committee, said today that the wealthy countries should broaden the discussion to include the countries that receive the aid. The debate so far "has tended to be a North Atlantic discussion," he said.
The ministers' endorsement of the World Bank's education plan is only the latest such effort, and some ministers acknowledged today that earlier efforts had fallen short.
"We need action now," said Eveline Herfkens, the Netherlands' minister of development cooperation. "We don't want to have another generation lost because they don't see the inside of a classroom." 
In the next three months, the World Bank will chose 10 countries that it thinks have developed strong reform plans but lack the money to put them in place. 
The World Bank eventually plans to give grants to all 88 developing countries it says have a large number of unschooled children.
In a report it issued this weekend, the bank said that at least one-quarter of the countries in both sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, and a significant percentage of countries in Latin America and the Middle East, are unlikely to reach the goal of full enrollment.

HEADLINE: Council Support Grows For a 'Living Wage' Bill 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
For years, community groups and labor unions have complained that New York City's government underwrites poverty by awarding contracts to companies that pay many of their workers $6 or $7 an hour. 
 This year, these groups are pushing hard for legislation that would force companies that receive city contracts and subsidies to raise their wages, and that effort has received a welcome response from the City Council. 
 Forty-five of the Council's 51 members are sponsoring a bill that would require many such companies to pay their workers at least $8.10 an hour with health benefits, or $9.60 an hour without benefits.
The bill's backers say it is a smart way to lift thousands of New York workers above the poverty line at little cost to the city. They estimate that the bill, called a living-wage bill, will raise wages for more than 70,000 workers and cost the city less than $10 million a year in increased contract costs. 
In an interview on Friday, Gifford Miller, the City Council speaker, said, "I believe it's the right thing for the city to do both from a moral and economic point of view, because when the city is making certain types of investments it should make sure the jobs created by those investments are lifting people out of poverty."
But the Bloomberg administration and many business groups warn that the city cannot afford the bill. They estimate that it would cost the city at least $100 million a year at a time when the city is struggling with a projected $4.9 billion deficit. Some business groups say it would pressure employers to eliminate thousands of low-wage jobs. 
City Hall officials are not openly threatening a veto, but they say they are uncomfortable with the proposal.
"We approach this with great trepidation," said Bill Cunningham, the communications director for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. "It's safe to say that if the living-wage bill is passed, the budget numbers we put out will be out of whack by another $125 million to $150 million."
The bill could be the focus of a major battle between the Council and Mr. Bloomberg partly because it is backed vigorously by many groups, including the Community Service Society, the New York City Central Labor Council, the Working Families Party and 1199/S.E.I.U., the giant health care workers' union.
The Council has scheduled a hearing on the bill tomorrow, and some Council members say they plan to vote on it in May. 
More than 80 other government bodies across the nation, including Suffolk County, have enacted these so-called living wage laws, sometimes mandating more than $12 an hour, prompted in part by the reluctance of the federal government to raise the $5.15 an hour minimum wage. (Suffolk's law, to take effect July 1, requires at least $9 an hour for people who work for agencies under contract to the county.)
The Community Service Society, a charitable group, completed a recent study showing that the New York City bill would enable many welfare recipients who had taken jobs to climb out of poverty.
David R. Jones, the society's president, said: "If we want to be serious about lifting people out of poverty, we have to be serious about the adequacy of wages. For good or for ill, welfare reform has forced a lot of people to depend on low-wage jobs."
The bill would cover employees of companies that have city contracts to provide home health care, day care and services to people with cerebral palsy. In addition, the bill would cover city contractors that provide building, food or temporary-help services as well as companies that receive subsidies to operate or renovate office buildings. And the bill would cover workers employed by the city's business improvement districts and by large buildings in which city agencies rent several floors. 
Under the bill, workers for these companies are to get at least $8.10 an hour this year, with the minimum rising by 50 cents a year, finally reaching $10 an hour in 2006.
Perhaps the most powerful lobbyist for the bill is Dennis Rivera, the president of 1199. Having persuaded Albany's lawmakers to enact a $1.8 billion package to finance raises for health care workers, he wants the City Council to pass the living-wage bill because it would lift wages for 50,000 home health care workers, most of them 1199 members.
Mr. Rivera said it would cost the city just $5 million to raise the wages of home care workers to $8.10, but because of a matching formula, Albany and Washington would pay another $45 million, he said, helping spur the city's ailing economy.
A powerful business group, the New York City Partnership and Chamber of Commerce, is opposing the bill because of its cost and the record-keeping burden it would place on companies to show they are in compliance.
Kathryn S. Wylde, the partnership's chief executive, said, "Given the current fiscal crisis the city faces and the fact that our unemployment rate has gone above 7 percent and we're higher than the rest of the country, at this point putting additional impositions on business just seems totally the wrong direction to be going."
The Business Council of New York State has also attacked the proposal, saying it would pressure companies to eliminate 9,000 low-wage jobs.
The bill's sponsors say they hope to avoid a confrontation with Mr. Bloomberg over the issue. They say that they want to hear City Hall's objections and will consider some changes to make it less objectionable to the mayor.
Bill Perkins, a council member from Harlem and one of the bill's earliest sponsors, said: "If the mayor wants to negotiate, we're prepared to negotiate. This is a bill that will have an economic impact that is positive, not negative."

Re "Organization Sells a Legacy of Hine Photos" (Arts pages, April 16):
 The National Child Labor Committee has not lost its "original mission." 
The problem of child labor is still a major problem in the United States (not just internationally), with hundreds of thousands of children exploited in agriculture, in sweatshops and in retail and manufacturing jobs from New York to California. 
 We have added to that mission a focus on jobless and underprepared young people trying to enter the labor market, and on teaching children about the world of work. But we have never lost sight of child labor.
We are struggling to survive, but there should be no mistaking the need for our work and for our organization.

HEADLINE: Some in Reno Say Do Not Put Asunder Artifacts of Divorce 

BYLINE:  By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN 

DATELINE: RENO, Nev. 

 BODY:
Back before the divorce was as common as the cold, there was Reno.
 It was here, along the Truckee River in what was then the biggest city in the state, that those seeking to untie the knot flocked to "take the cure," as a Reno divorce was known. 
 The mythology of divorce still hovers over the Virginia Street Bridge, where newly divorced women were said to fling their wedding bands into the roiling waters of the Truckee, having kissed the white columns of the Washoe County Courthouse, the stately dispensator of divorce, with red lipstick.
The Reno divorce -- Walter Winchell called it "Reno-vation" -- became a national institution in the 1930's, largely because of a 1931 law that allowed a person to obtain a divorce after residing in the state for six weeks. With divorces in most other states requiring long waiting periods and often proof or admission of adultery, Reno became what postcards described as "the divorce capital of the world" even as Las Vegas was little more than a desert outpost. 
But as Vegas gambling ascended, the Reno divorce receded. Now, a fledgling divorce preservation movement is seeking to protect the state's divorce landmarks. Two of the 11 historic sites listed this month as endangered by the group Preserve Nevada are related to divorce. 
One is the Virginia Street Bridge, Reno's Bridge of Sighs, which is threatened with removal in a flood-control plan. The other is the Silver State Lodge, the vintage log motel.
Hundreds of hotels, motels and boarding houses flourished in the back alleys and sagebrush of Reno, where about 32,000 marriages were dissolved from 1929 through 1939.
By the 1960's, no-fault divorce and more liberal social attitudes had killed the migratory divorce trade in Reno. Commercial development, urban sprawl, fire and neglect have since taken their toll, and few traces of the divorce industry survive.
Of all the institutions that have ridden off into the sunset, perhaps none was more romantic than the divorce ranch, where the combination of lonely women and handsome cowboys proved a lucrative mix.
"Some guests were drawn and tired, like life had dealt them a bad hand," said Joe Page, 79, a former wrangler at one of the ranches, the Flying ME, who had a room with a private bath and fireplace in the mid-1950's. "The whole tempo of the ranch was to get them introduced to life again." 
Sitting in his restored Victorian parlor in Virginia City, Mr. Page, who married four times, wistfully recalled a 19-year-old divorced woman named Holly from Corning, N.Y., who got away. "Her family convinced her not to associate with me," Mr. Page said. "They wrote the finishing chapter." The loss was still evident in his eyes. 
Guests from the Social Register hardly ever went to Reno because they wanted to avoid the press. 
"Back then, Reno had an international reputation," said Mella Rothwell Harmon, a historian with the state preservation office in Carson City, who recently wrote "Design for Divorce," to be published by Balcony Press. "We're beginning to recognize divorce as an important theme in our history."
Reno's notoriety as "an island in the sea of matrimony" began in 1906, when William Corey, president of the United States Steel Corporation, came here for a much-publicized divorce. It continued with Barbara Hutton and Clare Boothe Luce (then Brokaw), whose play "The Women" takes place at a hotel resembling the Riverside in Reno, now artists' lofts.
Mary Pickford divorced the actor Owen Moore here before rushing back to California to marry Douglas Fairbanks Sr. Arthur Miller wrote "The Misfits" while awaiting a divorce here, then married Marilyn Monroe, who plays a vulnerable Reno divorcee in the 1961 film.
"Not all of our history is pretty," said Andria S. Daley-Taylor, an adviser to the National Trust for Historic Preservation in Reno. "But it tells the story of the West."
Ms. Harmon spent years combing through 1930's divorce records to determine where the divorcing couples came from and the extent of local participation, which buoyed the Reno economy during the Depression. 
Sixty percent of the pilgrims were women. The euphemism for pregnancy was "the Reno worry."
"They were away from their families in a remote place with wide open spaces, gambling and men who made it their job to make sure they had a pleasant time," Ms. Harmon said. "Nature took its course pretty frequently."
Boarding houses, hotels with kitchenettes and about 36 divorce ranches sprang up to take advantage of Nevada's 1931 law, enacted to compete with Idaho, Florida and Arkansas. The less affluent created tent cities along the Truckee River, and even the Y.W.C.A. catered to divorce.
A plaintiff simply had to declare an intention to make Nevada his or her permanent home (most had a return ticket in their pockets) and offer testimony from a person, usually a landlady, that he or she had been a continuous resident for six weeks. If the divorce was uncontested, it was granted immediately on any number of grounds, some slight.
One of the handful of remaining divorce-oriented residences is Estelle Nystrom's Guest House, built in 1895 and now run as a regular boarding house by her daughter Sonia Martin. At its height, the house was home to two dozen women seeking divorces, and Ms. Martin, now 59, remembers playing in the courthouse rotunda almost daily as a girl while her mother testified.
"I thought I had a normal childhood," said Ms. Martin, now a graduate student in marriage and family therapy.
Pat Ferraro Klos grew up yearning to live in "a proper neighborhood," as she put it, instead of the Silver State Lodge, the second site on the endangered list.
Most of the ranches are gone now, including the TH, once owned by Cornelius Vanderbilt Jr. Vanderbilt offered a package divorce deal -- $795 a week for room and board, a horse, two trips to Reno, a bottle of liquor and a daily pack of cigarettes.
One of the few divorce ranches still standing is Washoe Pines, where Myrna Loy stayed. Believed to be the inspiration for the film version of "The Women," it was purchased by Maya Miller, now 86, who turned it into a private residence in 1960. "I wasn't equipped to take care of all those women," she said.
The setting remains intoxicatingly idyllic. "You can imagine what effect it would have on a housewife from Schenectady," said Ms. Harmon, the historian.
The fate of the city's most beloved divorce icon, the Virginia Street Bridge, built in 1905, remains in doubt. In a 1997 flood, the bridge's low arches were believed to have constricted the flow of water with a logjam of debris. The flood did $500 million to $700 million in damage.
A community coalition has been working with the Army Corps of Engineers on possible solutions, including tearing it down and building a new one. The prospect does not amuse preservationists. 
"Whether folklore, fakelore or what really happened, the bridge is symbolic of a rite of passage," said Guy Rocha, the Nevada state archivist.
Down the block, the Washoe County Courthouse and Historical Preservation Society is trying to raise $100,000 to restore Courtroom No. 1, once the divorce seeker's promised land. One morning recently, Judge Peter I. Breen, who presides over the courtroom, recalled "the fancy divorce decrees, backed in blue with red ribbons and a big gold seal."
In retrospect, Judge Breen said of the state's divorce legacy, "it shows how enlightened we were out here," adding, "It's valuable to remember the unnatural restrictions we've placed on human relations, and the position women have been in."
On the columns outside the courthouse the red lipstick smudges are gone, but perhaps not the moral. "We've come a long way," Judge Breen said. "To preserve and remember provides continuity."

A copyright dispute with the Church of Scientology is forcing Google to do some creative linking.

BYLINE:  By David F. Gallagher 

 BODY:
GOOGLE, the company behind the popular Web search engine, has been playing a complicated game recently that involves the Church of Scientology and a controversial copyright law. 
 Legal experts say the episode highlights problems with the law that can make companies or individuals liable for linking to sites they do not control. And it has turned Google, whose business is built around a database of two billion Web pages, into a quiet campaigner for the freedom to link. 
 The church sent a complaint to Google last month, saying that its search results for "Scientology" included links to copyrighted church material that appears on a Web site critical of the church. Under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, which was intended to make it easier for copyright holders to fight piracy, the complaint meant that Google was required to remove those links quickly or risk being sued for contributing to copyright infringement. 
The site in question, Operation Clambake (www.xenu.net), is based in Norway, beyond the reach of the United States copyright act. The site portrays the church as a greedy cult that exploits its members and harasses critics. Andreas Heldal-Lund, the site's owner, says the posting of church materials, including some internal documents and pictures of church leaders, is allowable under the "fair use" provisions of internationally recognized copyright law. 
When Google responded to the church's complaint by removing the links to the Scientology material, techies and free-speech advocates accused Google of censoring its search results. Google also briefly removed the link to Operation Clambake's home page but soon restored it, saying the removal had been a mistake. 
At that point, according to Matthew Cutts, a software engineer at Google, it started developing a better way to handle such complaints. "We respond very quickly to challenges, and not just technical challenges but also these sort of interesting, delicate situations, as well," Mr. Cutts said. 
Under Google's new policy, when it receives a complaint that causes it to remove links from its index, it will give a copy of the complaint to the Chilling Effects Clearinghouse (chillingeffects.org). Chilling Effects is a project of a civil liberties advocacy group called the Electronic Frontier Foundation and several law schools. It it offers information about Internet rights issues. 
In the new procedure, Google informs its users when a link has been removed from a set of search results and directs them to the Chilling Effects site. For example, a search for the word "helatrobus," which appears in some Scientology texts, brings up a page of results with this notice at the bottom: "In response to a complaint we received under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, we have removed one result(s) from this page. If you wish, you may read the D.M.C.A. complaint for these removed results."
The notice includes a link to Scientology's complaint on chillingeffects.org, which lists the Web addresses of the material to which Google no longer links. The result is that a complaint could end up drawing more attention to the very pages it is trying to block. 
Mr. Cutts said Google started linking to chillingeffects.org early this month but made no announcement, so it took a while for word to go around online. Meanwhile, Scientology sent Google two more complaints, citing pages within copies of the Operation Clambake site on other servers. All three complaints are now on the Chilling Effects site. 
Don Marti, the technical editor of Linux Journal, first wrote about Google's move on the magazine's site. He said he had been so upset about the company's initial response to the Scientologists that he organized a small group of protesters who visited Google's headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., where he also lives. Mr. Marti says he now applauds Google's efforts to make the process more transparent. If a letter of complaint simply makes a site more popular, "only a fool would send one," he said. 
Helena Kobrin, a lawyer representing Scientology at the law firm of Moxon & Kobrin in Los Angeles, said that Google's use of the letters of complaint would not discourage the church from pursuing further complaints if necessary and that there was nothing in the letters that needed to be hidden. "I think they show very graphically to people that the only thing we're trying to do is protect copyrights," she said. 
As part of its new process for handling complaints, Mr. Cutts said, Google added more information on its site explaining how site owners could have their links restored by filing a countercomplaint with Google. (The required forms can be downloaded from chillingeffects.org.) If site owners take this step, he said, they accept responsibility for the contents of their pages. 
Mr. Heldal-Lund, a Norwegian citizen, said he would not file a countercomplaint because it would put him under the jurisdiction of United States law. He said that he regretted making so much trouble for Google but was glad that the incident had highlighted the church's pursuit of its critics. 
The church, which has beliefs based on the idea that people need to release themselves from trauma suffered in past lives, has taken a keen interest in the Internet since 1994, when someone posted secret church teachings on an online discussion group. Critics say the church guards its teachings closely because it wants its followers to pay for access to higher levels of instruction. The church says that these payments are donations and that it is simply seeking to protect its rights online.
With its Chilling Effects partnership, Google is subtly making the point that the right to link is important to its business and to the health of the Web, said David G. Post, a law professor at Temple University who specializes in Internet issues. 
"This is an example where copyright law is being used in conflict with free connectivity and free expression on the Net," he said. Dr. Post said Google's situation highlighted the need for more awareness of copyright issues, including pending legislation that is more restrictive than the 1998 law. The measure is backed by entertainment giants like Walt Disney, but technology companies like Intel have come out against it, saying it would hurt consumers and slow innovation. 
Mr. Cutts said that the links to the complaints were not a political statement, just a way to "make sure our users get all of the information that they need." He said that Google had no official position on the copyright act and that so far it had not been involved in political activity or lobbying. But he said it "might take an interest in more of those issues." 
The copyright controversy has had an interesting side effect for Operation Clambake. The Google software judges the importance of a page in part by looking at how many other pages link to it. Scientology's complaint set off a flurry of linking to the critics' site, pushing it up two spots to No. 2 in the search results for "Scientology" -- just below the church's official site.

50 D'Arcy Workers To Lose Their Jobs

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
 D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles is laying off about 50 employees, or 10 percent of the staff in its New York office. 
Diana McSweeney, a spokeswoman for D'Arcy, confirmed an Adweek report, that about 50 jobs were being eliminated from the New York agency, saying, "the layoffs affected all departments and were across all management levels." 
 The layoffs come two weeks after Procter & Gamble, moved its $30 million Pampers account in the United States from D'Arcy to Saatchi & Saatchi in New York, part of the Publicis Groupe. Lance Smith, president of D'Arcy New York, said the layoffs were in response to "recent economic conditions."

HEADLINE: The Washington Budget Box 

 BODY:
President Bush has been asserting lately that the budget is so tight there is barely enough money to pay for anything new besides the war on terrorism. He has begun issuing veto threats if Congress tries to defy his spending priorities. How bizarre it is, then, for him to contend at the same time that the nation needs another tax cut. Last week, the House went along, making permanent the ill-advised 10-year, $1.35 trillion tax reduction enacted last year. The Bush proposal would drain nearly $400 billion more over the next 10 years and cost at least $4 trillion in the decade after that. A more irresponsible position would be hard to imagine. 
 The sad truth about budget politics this year is that Congress and the Bush administration have gotten themselves into such a box that irresponsible posturing becomes the easiest recourse. The tax cut of last year, along with the recent mild economic downturn, vaporized the revenues needed to deal with anything outside military and homeland defenses. Yet the Democrats who would like to spend more money on education, health and other areas are too nervous to repeal the tax cut in an election year. As a result, the Senate, which is controlled by Democrats, may be unable to pass any budget resolution this year. 
 The reason for the Democrats' failure is simple. Earlier this year, the Senate Budget Committee approved a sensible resolution calling for some restraint on military spending, no new tax cuts and more paying down of the federal debt. But conservative Democrats want less domestic spending and more tax cuts, and some liberals want more domestic spending. Republicans are not ready to supply the votes for the Democratic budget resolution.
When it comes to facing up to reality, the Republicans are being no less irresponsible. The House, where the Republicans are in control, is unable to pass a vital measure sought by the Bush administration to increase the federal debt limit. Most Republicans don't want to admit that their own policies have returned the nation to the days of racking up more deficits and debts.
Budget resolutions were designed to place ceilings on overall spending and force Congress to write appropriations bills that live with them. There was no resolution in 1998 because at that time the House and Senate could not agree on one. Still, the resolutions are often useful because they can help control Congress's tendency to embark on pork-barrel spending. Without any specific spending limits, Congress needs to exercise some discipline while making sure that essential needs are met -- an unlikely scenario in an election year.
Mr. Bush needs to get off his veto-threat strategy and work with the lawmakers on finding money to sustain investments in the right areas. If the nation is to meet its domestic needs, and protect the next generation of retirees, the tax cut should not be made permanent. Instead, large parts of it, especially those benefiting the wealthiest, should be rescinded -- the sooner the better.

HEADLINE: President to Use Earth Day To Sell Environmental Plan 

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: NASHVILLE, April 21 

 BODY:
Monday is Earth Day, an annual rite of spring for the last 32 years. But this Earth Day will sound less like a love-in for Mother Earth than like an October rally in a presidential election year.
 George W. Bush, a former oil executive, is not normally identified with Earth Day rituals but like any president feels the need to flash some green credentials. Earth Day will find him in the acid-rain-besotted Adirondacks in upstate New York with Christie Whitman, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. 
 With Whiteface Mountain as his backdrop, Mr. Bush is to help restore a hiking trail and promote his "Clear Skies" initiative, a proposal that the administration says will yield cleaner air than the Clean Air Act signed by his father in 1990. Protesters will be on hand to assert that his proposal would only make things worse and to complain about Mr. Bush's inaction on global warming, a phenomenon some say can be seen when, among other things, fewer of the big lakes in the Adirondacks are freezing over in the winter.
 At the same time, Al Gore, derided by Mr. Bush's father as Ozone Man, is planning to give a blistering speech in Nashville about what he calls Mr. Bush's environmental failures. His setting is an academic forum in his home state, where he is trying to make amends for past inattention.
 Whether a rerun of campaign 2000 or a harbinger of campaign 2004, the dueling events will showcase what Democrats believe is one of their most potent political issues, one that stands out as a rare piece of terra firma in a world dominated by the military imperatives of a popular Republican commander in chief.
 Republicans play down the environment as an electoral issue. They say that they were simply outgunned by the environmental lobby on last week's vote on whether to drill for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, partly because the big oil companies cared less about it than about staving off automotive fuel-efficiency standards.
Glen Bolger, a Republican pollster with Public Opinion Strategies, said a national survey that he completed last week showed the environment ranking ninth on a list of nine priorities for voters, after terrorism, the economy, education and health care.
 "The public is pro-environment, make no mistake about that," Mr. Bolger said. "But they're not as anti-Republican or pro-environment as the Sierra Club would have you believe. Where environmental issues are hot are when it's a local issue that impacts people near their homes."
 Environmentalists have come to similar conclusions but frame them a little differently. A recent poll conducted for the League of Conservation Voters shows that while voters approve overwhelmingly of Mr. Bush's handling of the war on terrorism, the economy and education, they do not approve of his record on the environment.
 If these issues do not motivate those who have already decided about candidates, they can motivate important swing voters.
 "The environment consistently ranks as a voting issue for independent voters, women and suburban voters, all of whom are the battleground in November," said Phil Clapp, president of the National Environmental Trust.
 The vote on drilling last week might be followed this week by another rebuff to Mr. Bush's energy policy when the Senate takes up a package of measures related to global warming. Bipartisan compromises being worked out now would reject the president's approaches to international and domestic climate-change policy and, Democrats hope, further put the president on the defensive.
 Polls a year ago showed Mr. Bush weighed down by the environment. The catastrophe of Sept. 11 quieted environmentalists for a time and then forced them to redirect their criticisms of the president to criticisms of his policies.
 But with the approach of the 2002 Congressional elections, and the difficulty Democrats face in gaining traction on other fronts, that is changing.
 The Natural Resources Defense Council is running an advertisement on Earth Day mocking what it suggests is the president's one-day-a-year homage to things green.
 "The ad marks a significant departure from our post-attack posture of talking more about the wishes of big, polluting corporations than about President Bush's own involvement in an unprecedented attack on 30 years of successful environmental protections," said Alan Metrick, the group's spokesman.
 Deb Callahan, president of the League of Conservation Voters, said the president's own policies in favor of the extractive industries of oil, gas and coal had helped regenerate the environmental movement.
 "Before 9/11, it was evident to anyone in politics that the environment was genuinely shaping up to be a top-tier issue in electoral politics in a way it had not been," she said.
When Mr. Gore previewed his speech on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times today, the White House said it was politics as usual. "The president has a strong record on the environment, and the environment is one of the reasons he defeated Al Gore in the election of 2000, among other issues," the president's spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said. "Even in a time of peace and prosperity, Al Gore made the same charges and still lost the election." 
 For accomplishments, the administration points chiefly to helping clean up brownfields in urban areas and to bringing about legal changes in the Superfund program that had been deadlocked in Congress for years.
"We realize that some people may not give us credit for things we do right, but we're determined to make those right environmental policies anyway," one administration official said.
 Mr. Bolger, the Republican pollster, also dismissed issues like those that Mr. Gore was raising as a priority only for hard-core Democrats. 
"The environment resonates most strongly with the beats, the backpackers and the bangles crowd," he said. "And they are pretty well on the far left of the Democratic party."

HEADLINE: The Calm Before The Cuts 

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT; E-mail: bobherb@nytimes.com

 BODY:
New Yorkers are, to some extent, in a period of denial now. Which is understandable. It's a relatively quiet time, between the terrible events of last year and the all but inevitable decline in the quality of life that will result from the service cuts that are being readied to help close a staggering $5 billion gap in the city's budget.
 Last week, with temperatures ridiculously hot -- the mid-90's in mid-April -- you could walk around parts of Manhattan and convince yourself that the happy and prosperous times had returned, that the worst was over, that it was O.K., finally, to exhale. 
 Relaxed and smiling faces were everywhere. You could see them if you strolled among the vast expanses of bodies sprawled lazily on the grass of Central Park or Bryant Park, or among the sunbathers at Coney Island, or the throngs turning out for the hit Broadway shows, or the shoppers surging through Midtown, or the elegant patrons waiting to be seated at the most exclusive restaurants.
You could almost feel that New York was back.
But my best guess is that this is just a timeout. There's more trouble ahead. The background noise that catches your attention if you listen very closely is very disturbing.
Two weeks ago a 66-year-old woman on her way home from church was shot and killed when she was caught in the crossfire of a gunfight in Brooklyn. A few days later, a young man on a date was shot and critically wounded in an attempted robbery on a street in Greenwich Village. 
The city's government is desperately short of money and officials are preparing a budget that will mean fewer police officers, fewer garbage collections and even fewer resources for a public school system that is already being bled dry.
Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who is presiding over this potentially drastic rollback in services, was asked on Thursday just how frightened New Yorkers should be if he is unable to get the help he says he needs from the federal and state governments and the municipal unions. "We have to come up with the money, or we have to reduce the services, or some balance between," he said. "It is a matter of great concern. If you want to use the word fear, I certainly am worried about it."
At the moment there is no evidence of a creative collective effort to maneuver the city through this looming crisis in ways that would avoid the infliction of serious wounds and, perhaps, permanent scars.
Consider, for example, the perennial problem of policing. The Giuliani administration spent enormous sums of money in its ultimately successful fight against crime. A special dedicated tax, enacted when David Dinkins was mayor, was used to expand the department to 41,000 officers. And many millions of dollars in overtime were expended year after year.
Now, for a variety of reasons, the police force has contracted. And budgetary considerations are forcing further contractions. This is occurring at a time when the department has the additional responsibility of coping with the threat of terrorism.
Rudolph Giuliani did more with more. Is it reasonable to expect that Mr. Bloomberg can do more with less?
On Thursday, the same day the mayor was expressing his own concern, hundreds of advocates, protesters, teachers, parents and students showed up outside City Hall to voice their dismay over the harsh cuts.
They had a point. While the mayor has ruled out tax increases (with the exception of a cigarette-tax hike), he has been more than willing to impose severe cuts in essential services like police and fire protection, garbage collection, public education and other important services for children, the elderly and the poor.
The feeling among those who gathered outside City Hall was that the burden of sacrifice in these tough times was not being shared and, in particular, that too many of the sacrifices were being borne by children.
"There has not been an honest public conversation about how this budget is going to affect the lives of children," said Gail Nayowith, who heads the Citizens Committee for Children.
She and others urged Mr. Bloomberg to sit down with City Council members and others to explore ways to raise additional revenues and to ease some of the proposed cuts.
I would expand that conversation to others -- to the university and business communities, and religious leaders, and anyone else who may have some good ideas about maintaining safety and a reasonable quality of life in tough economic times.

PERSON: Willis J. Winn 

HEADLINE: Willis J. Winn, 84, Ex-Dean of Wharton And Official of Fed 

BYLINE:  By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Willis J. Winn, a former Federal Reserve Bank official and Wharton School dean who helped shape the country's economic policies in the 1960's and 1970's, died on April 11 at a hospital in Kansas City, Mo. He was 84 and lived in Trimble, Mo.
 He suffered a stroke, his family said. 
 Dr. Winn was dean of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in the 1960's. Under his guidance, the school promoted public service and sought to instill a social awareness in its graduates. Its graduate and undergraduate programs expanded to prepare students for a wider range of professions in banking and accounting, as well as occupations like theater or hospital management.
From 1961 to 1970, Dr. Winn was a director of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank, and he was its board chairman from 1966 to 1970. After leaving Wharton and the University of Pennsylvania in 1971, he was elected president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Cleveland, where he served until 1982.
He sat on the Fed's influential Open Market Committee during some volatile economic times under Arthur F. Burns and Paul A. Volcker, the chairmen of the Fed from 1970 to 1987. His tenure coincided with Mr. Volcker's efforts to lower the inflation rate through painful increases in interest rates, a policy that Dr. Winn supported.
Willis Jay Winn was born in Plattsburg, Mo., and graduated from Central College in Fayette, Mo. He received a master's in 1940 and a Ph.D. in 1951 in finance at the University of Pennsylvania, where he began his academic career in 1946.
He served as dean at the Wharton School from 1958 to 1971, as well as vice provost of the university.
Dr. Winn is survived by his wife of 59 years, Lois Gengelbach Willis; a daughter, Judith Ann, of Shorewood, Wis.; a son, Steven J., of San Francisco; and one granddaughter.

BYLINE:  By JIM YARDLEY 

DATELINE: LOS INDIOS, Tex., April 18 

 BODY:
"Used" does not describe the royal blue 1986 Toyota pickup idling at the bridge into Mexico. Rust has chewed into the doors. The odometer reads 189,589 miles. Someone in Utah was surely thrilled when a smiling Guatemalan named Billy Pineda paid $1,000 for it.
 Yet the life, or second life, of that Toyota has only begun. Mr. Pineda, 27, having just driven 1,301 miles from Salt Lake City to the border, is about to drive 1,000 miles to Guatemala. He has filled the Toyota with stuffed animals, a used television, a set of socket wrenches, a used tire and an air-conditioner. A Barbie Car is strapped to the roof, and he is towing a second pickup, loaded with old bicycles. 
 He plans to spend the next three days driving down the Atlantic coast of Mexico, sleeping in the Toyota, until he arrives in Guatemala, where he will sell everything. If he is lucky, he says, he will net $1,000. He will visit his wife and three children, then fly back to Utah, where he has relatives, and start the process again. He makes more than 25 trips a year.
"For the local people, it's something normal," he said of his occupation. "There are a lot of people who do this for a living."
Here at the southernmost tip of the Mexican border, men like Mr. Pineda are known as transmigrantes, and their rusted, rolling caravans of junk are a common sight along Military Highway, just north of the Rio Grande. They operate in the shadows of the bustling Nafta economy, buying junker cars and throwaway goods in the United States, then driving to Central America, where people are so poor that a battered 1986 Toyota can seem like a dream car.
Dusty towns like Los Indios serve as border checkpoints for the transmigrantes, and Military Highway is dotted with hand-painted signs advertising the brokers who can expedite the paperwork with customs officials in Mexico and the United States. Though the occasional junker turns out to be stolen, statistics show that legitimate business has been brisk: in the last two weeks, transmigrantes have transported more than 350 used cars a day over bridges here in Cameron County. At that rate, they would be taking more than 127,000 vehicles a year into Central America from these crossings alone.
Parked in the gravel parking lot outside a broker's office, the Volvo flatbed truck driven by Ramiro Rivas is a motorized pack mule. Mr. Rivas, 51, took to the road after he lost his government job in El Salvador a decade ago. On this trip, he bought the old Volvo at an auction in Maryland and loaded onto it a junked Isuzu pickup with 300,000 miles that he had bought for $300.
He also bought a horse trailer and stuffed it with old stereo speakers and appliances, and is pulling it behind the Volvo. Nothing he is carrying would pass muster even at a yard sale in the United States. But those who buy from him in El Salvador, he says, cannot afford anything else. 
"Over there," he said through a translator, "you would not be able to purchase a vehicle, even a used vehicle, with the money you earn. Here in the United States, buying a used vehicle is like buying a used TV." 
Pete Sepulveda Jr., director of the international bridge system in Cameron County, says transmigrantes are skilled at automotive innovation. He has seen them take the seats out of school buses, he says, and stuff a couple of compact cars inside. "It's all in an effort to make a living," he said. "What might be a junk vehicle for us is a gold mine for them." 
Many of the transmigrantes start out from auctions as distant as Connecticut. Mr. Pineda's own routine, from Salt Lake City to Guatemala, often means six days of steady driving, with the most perilous part in Mexico. Mexican law prohibits leaving foreign used vehicles in the country, and the Mexican police have been known to keep a watchful eye on transmigrantes and to demand bribes.
The country's roads can also be treacherous. The new toll roads are too expensive for the transmigrantes, and that leaves the narrow mountainous routes along the Atlantic coast. Mr. Rivas said some stretches were so bad that it could take two hours to advance 50 miles.
The other concern is security. Many of the drivers prefer to travel in caravans, some with as many as 50 vehicles, to discourage holdup men. Mr. Rivas says he has never been robbed, though he insists on driving only in the daytime, staying in cheap hotels at night. Mr. Pineda, younger and more carefree, drives night and day, sleeping inside his vehicle du jour. Once, he says, he was robbed of his entire load at gunpoint as he neared the Guatemalan border.
The busiest seasons are Christmas and Easter, when the lines of transmigrantes can stretch for hundreds of yards every day as they await passage over the bridge here. For Mr. Rivas, who has a wife and two children in El Salvador, the job is no different from that of a long-haul trucker. For Mr. Pineda, who has a green card and has driven for nearly six years, the hope is to continue until he can become a United States citizen and bring his family here.
"America," he said, his crumbling pickup groaning under the weight of so much secondhand treasure, "it's marvelous."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: CHARITIES; 
Narrowly Drawn Rules Freeze Out Tens of Thousands of Indirect Victims, Report Says

BYLINE:  By STEPHANIE STROM 

 BODY:
Tens of thousands of indirect victims of the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center are struggling to obtain services because of narrowly drawn eligibility requirements for federal money and for the charities set up after Sept. 11, according to a study to be released today by the United Way of New York City.
 These victims, who lost livelihoods rather than loved ones as a result of the attack, even though they did not work in the immediate area, fail to qualify for help and are losing homes, health insurance and peace of mind, the study says. This has put further strains on the city's nonprofit service providers. 
 "The ripple effect on the economy has been much greater than just south of Canal Street," said Lawrence Mandell, executive vice president of the United Way of New York City. 
The increased demand for charitable services from those who fail to meet the eligibility guidelines established by the federal government and various charitable funds set up since the attack comes at a time when city and state financing for nonprofit programs is falling.
"Food pantries are reporting huge increases in the number of people coming in," said Lilliam Barrios-Paoli, chief executive for agency services at the United Way. "Evictions are on the rise, and so is the demand for shelter."
About $2 billion flowed into the various charities set up to address the immediate victims -- or those who lost a relative or who worked in the area below Canal Street and lost jobs -- and roughly half the money has been disbursed.
Using that money for anyone other than those directly affected is difficult because it would run counter to the intentions of the donors.
The American Red Cross was widely criticized for saying it would hold back some of the donations it received for Sept. 11 victims as a reserve fund for future disasters. Although that is standard procedure among disaster relief agencies, the fuss made other charities cautious about the way they disbursed funds earmarked for Sept. 11.
"The Sept. 11 charities, including our own Sept. 11 Fund, are focused on the area below Canal Street, where the victims were most directly affected," Mr. Mandell said, referring to the fund the United Way administers jointly with the New York Community Trust. "Those funds need to be very concerned about donor intent."
The report, compiled by Appleseed, a consulting firm that specializes in nonprofits, public agencies and corporations, estimates that the attacks eliminated 110,000 jobs, either directly in the area around the World Trade Center or indirectly as a result of a drop in tourism that affected workers in hotels, restaurants, garages and the airline industry.
For instance, about 9,000 people in aviation lost jobs last fall, but because most of them worked in Queens, they are not eligible for assistance. 
Similarly, people who lost jobs in hotels below Canal Street can receive assistance, but hotel workers who lost jobs in Midtown when tourism dropped after the attacks cannot.
Reductions in work hours have reduced wages for an even greater number of people since the attacks, and those cutbacks can mean the difference between being able to pay rent and becoming homeless.
A worker making $400 a week whose income drops to $200, whether because of unemployment or because his hours were cut, is not likely to be able to pay his rent. 
Many organizations, like the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Services and the UJA-Federation, have stepped in with short-term assistance, using money provided by foundations and other donors.
Workers who lose jobs can also apply for unemployment insurance.
In many cases, those short-term programs are already running out, the report found. "Unemployment is running out, and we can see it," Ms. Barrios-Paoli said. "Now people are having to turn to the traditional sources people go to when they are in dire straits, and we may very well see a spike in the number of people going to welfare for the first time."
Finding money to address the needs of indirect victims of the attacks will not be easy. Government budgets are under pressure, donors have already contributed vast amounts of money for those directly hit by the attacks, and many traditional donors, be they institutions or individuals, have themselves been hit by the weak economy.
The United Way is hoping, however, that it can help its various affiliated agencies to help their clients tap existing programs more effectively. By one estimate, for instance, some 900,000 New Yorkers are eligible for food stamps but are not enrolled in the program, and only 3 percent of the low-income families eligible for the earned income tax credit actually take it.
"We don't fully utilize all of the funding streams that are available," Ms. Barrios-Paoli said. "Just figuring out ways to help people tap those would make a huge difference."

HEADLINE: Heard on the Fairway: The Whisper of Shorter Hems 

BYLINE:  By GINIA BELLAFANTE 

 BODY:
Six months ago, Dara O'Hara, a sales associate at Sotheby's, decided she wanted to go to golf school. She had in mind the intensive three-day clinic offered by the P.G.A. National academy in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., and she sent e-mails to a few friends, also serious golfers, to see who might want to join her. Before long, she found herself spearheading a trip for a group of 19 -- all women and most of them an enviable distance from middle age. 
 The friends made their pilgrimage to Florida last weekend, dividing into threes for instruction with different pros. "There were two high-profile Wall Street executives among us," Melissa Barrett Rhodes, one of the participants, said. "At one point, there were two conference calls going on at once." So Ms. Barrett Rhodes, a former editor at Harper's Bazaar who now works at the Fabien Baron design firm, was stunned when an older pro announced that he was glad so many women have picked up the game because, he said, "it has showed their husbands they can really do something." 
 No other game, as John Updike once wrote, is as thoroughly associated with capitalism and its oppression as golf. Five million women are playing golf in the United States today, and it is fair to say that many bump up against a fairway culture that at times still seems under the influence of a very patrician Archie Bunker. It is also fair to suggest that golf's sex wars are being fought most visibly through fashion.
Whether a delayed reaction to the glamour-positive thinking of postfeminism or merely a concession to the fact that sex sells, some women on the pro tour are turning up dressed in a manner one does not equate with a sport that has typically encouraged women to look like home economics teachers. Just last week, Sports Illustrated profiled Natalie Gulbis, who, in her first year on the tour, has shown up in skirts not much longer than those worn by figure skaters. Her excursions in style have brought her a good deal of attention and led the magazine to dub her golf's It Girl, and the sport's potential Anna Kournikova. Ms. Gulbis also signed with William Morris and specifically with Norman Brokaw, the agent who once represented Marilyn Monroe.
Last year, the Swedish golfer Catrin Nilsmark, who is outfitted by the designer Johan Lindeberg, sparked considerable debate when she arrived to compete in tight-fitting shorts about the size of a compact disc.
The attention does not come as unwelcome for Ty Votaw, the commissioner of the L.P.G.A., who last month held a three-day summit in which he laid out his plan for elevating the celebrity level of women golfers. He came under some criticism in the sports press for suggesting that players consider looking better. 
"I want our players to be fashion forward," Mr. Votaw said. "I want the fans to find our players aspirational. No one seems to remember that Nancy Lopez was wearing pretty short shorts." He was referring, of course, to the most popular player in L.P.G.A. history.
Mr. Votaw said that the L.P.G.A. regularly receives e-mail from golfers habituated to the rules of private clubs who disapprove of what some pros have been wearing. But as Mr. Votaw put it, "we're not looking at halter tops here."
He certainly has a point. What is understood as risque in the world of the long iron might easily pass for churchwear by stylistic disciples of Britney Spears. But one must consider the typically stringent dress codes to which many elite clubs still subject members of both sexes. At Winged Foot, the fabled golf club in Westchester County, N.Y., for example, men are still prohibited from wearing shorts. "I remember saying to Sylvester Stallone or George Stephanopoulos," Colin Burns, the club's golf director, recalled, " 'maybe your host didn't tell you, but shirts have to be tucked in here.' "
Generally, women at private clubs are prohibited from wearing shirts that are both collarless and sleeveless, a rule intended to discourage the tank top. Shorts and skirts must rest no higher than four inches above the knee, but often they are worn just at the knee. Of course, such a look is dramatically less rigid than the ankle-length skirts and twin sets worn by women in the 50's and 60's, and interpreted memorably by Katharine Hepburn in "Pat and Mike."
"Club pros are supposed to emulate the guys on the tour," Kim Grahn, the assistant pro at John's Island, an old guard country club in Vero Beach, Fla., observed. "But we can't emulate the girls on the tour because if I did, I couldn't work here."
At the same time, what is available to women golfers, fashionwise, has never been so expansive. Armani, Prada, Tommy Hilfiger, Burberry and Escada have all begun to offer golf clothes that veer from the formula of pleated shorts that are roomy enough for two. Ralph Lauren has had a successful line for more than 10 years. Two months ago, because of the growth in the business, a company spokeswoman said, Ralph Lauren signed its first L.P.G.A. pro to a sponsorship, Carin Koch of Sweden. Last year, Patty Woo, a young woman who gave up a banking career at Goldman Sachs, entered the fray with a line of flat-front shorts and tops that to some eyes might seem provocatively well-fitting.
And the magazine Golf for Women recently hired a fashion director. The fashion spreads have women cavorting about in gingham wrap dresses and cotton miniskirts. "I was down at the Masters," Susan K. Reed, the editor in chief, said, "and some women were telling me how much they appreciate the fashion in the magazine and love the clothes. But they said, 'We could never wear that at our clubs,' and I said, 'Well, petition them!' "
Analogous to going braless in 1967, it may not be, but some women are beginning to break the rules. Ms. Barrett Rhodes said that a few of the friends with whom she attended golf school alighted on the green in tiny Lilly Pulitzer shorts or skirts equally rebellious. "It's the same idea as wearing a stiletto," she explained. "In the right context, it's empowering."

HEADLINE: Gay Man to Seek Benefits for Loss of Companion on Sept. 11 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT F. WORTH 

 BODY:
A gay man whose partner died in the World Trade Center attack is seeking benefits as a spouse in what lawyers have called the first effort by gay or lesbian partners to seek coverage under New York State's workers' compensation law.
 The man, Larry Courtney, 57, said he had lived for more than 13 years with his partner, Eugene Clark, who worked on the 102nd floor of 2 World Trade Center as an administrative assistant at Aon Consulting. 
 If he had been married, Mr. Courtney would have been eligible under the workers' compensation law for up to $400 per week for the rest of his life or until he remarried, said Adam L. Aronson, a lawyer with Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, which is representing Mr. Courtney. 
But he was denied benefits by CNA Insurance in March, and will challenge that decision today in a hearing at the Manhattan office of the New York State Workers' Compensation Board, Mr. Aronson said.
"We would have gotten a marriage license if we had been able to do so," said Mr. Courtney, who joined New York City's Domestic Partner Registry with Mr. Clark in 1994.
"It makes me angry that they would not recognize a relationship that has been so committed for so many years," he said.
Mr. Courtney wept and was unable to read his prepared statement at a news conference yesterday announcing his claim.
Afterward, he said he had received financial help from the Red Cross after Sept. 11, but because of lost income, was forced nonetheless to move to another apartment in Manhattan.
The workers' compensation board did not return a call yesterday seeking comment.
Insurance companies defer to New York State workers' compensation law in deciding eligibility, said Robert Hartwig, the chief economist at the Insurance Information Institute, a trade association.
Charles Boesel, a spokesman for CNA Insurance, would not comment yesterday, citing company policies on unresolved claims.
There are at least 21 other gay or lesbian people whose partners died in the trade center attack, Mr. Aronson said. It is not clear whether any of them will file for benefits, he added.
Mr. Courtney did not say whether he had sought benefits from the federal Victims Compensation Fund. That fund determines benefits according to the policies of the applicant's home state, but is not affected by the state's workers' compensation laws, Mr. Hartig said.
Bill Valentine of Manhattan, whose partner, Joe Lopez, died in the crash of American Airlines Flight 587 in Queens in November, also spoke at the new conference. Mr. Valentine is also filing for benefits under the workers' compensation law, Mr. Aronson said.
His hearing with the state compensation board is scheduled to take place in July. 
Mr. Valentine, whose partner was a flight attendant on Flight 587, said American Airlines and his employer, New York University, had treated him as a spouse.
He added that he hoped the state would follow suit.
At today's hearing, an administrative law judge will rule on Mr. Courtney's claim, Mr. Aronson said. It can then be appealed to the board, and that decision can in turn be appealed to the New York State Court of Appeals, he said.
"We're going to make our best argument that they are surviving spouses," Mr. Aronson said. "You don't need a marriage license to be a spouse."

HEADLINE: Justices Plan to Re-examine 2 Legal Weapons in Protests 

BYLINE:  By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 22 

 BODY:
The Supreme Court agreed today to use a long-running lawsuit against disruptive anti-abortion groups to decide whether the federal laws against racketeering and extortion can be invoked to stop and to punish political protests that use tactics like blockades and sit-ins.
 On a day when Washington was the scene of marches and demonstrations by groups protesting the International Monetary Fund and favoring the Palestinian cause, the court took up the long-running abortion case for the second time in eight years. 
 In a 1994 decision, the court ruled unanimously that the National Organization for Women and a group of abortion clinics could pursue their lawsuit against Operation Rescue and other anti-abortion organizations and their leaders without the need to show that there was an economic motive behind the blockades and other tactics intended to deter women from having abortions. Congress had not included an economic motive when it passed the Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, the 1970 law usually known as RICO, the court ruled. 
The case, originally filed in 1986, then went to trial in Federal District Court in Chicago and resulted in victory for the plaintiffs, who won not only damages from Operation Rescue and a coalition called the Pro-Life Action League, but also a nationwide injunction against protest techniques that included blockades, trespass, property damage and violence.
In accepting the abortion protesters' appeal, the Supreme Court agreed to decide two issues. The first is whether the RICO law authorizes courts to go beyond awarding damages and also to grant injunctions in cases brought by private plaintiffs. The second question is whether the federal anti-extortion law, the Hobbs Act, which makes it a crime to obtain "property from another" through the use of actual or threatened force, defines as property such intangible rights as the right of access to abortion services.
The Hobbs Act question is important because the RICO law, which makes it illegal to conduct the "affairs" of an "enterprise" through a "pattern of racketeering activity," requires proof of at least two illegal acts. The jury found that the anti-abortion groups had committed at least 21 violations of the Hobbs Act in their clinic protests. Jurors rejected the defendants' argument that by preventing women from getting abortions and doctors from providing them, the protesters had not "obtained" any "property" and so had not violated the Hobbs Act.
The amount of money involved in the case, Scheidler v. National Organization for Women, No. 01-1118, is modest. The jury awarded one abortion clinic, the Delaware Women's Health Organization Inc., $31,456 in damages, and a Wisconsin-based clinic, Summit Women's Health Organization Inc., $54,472. These amounts are tripled under the RICO law.
The interests at stake are obviously greater than the dollar amounts, and the case has attracted attention outside the world of abortion advocacy. In addition to Catholic and specifically anti-abortion organizations, groups ranging from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Inc. to the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, filed briefs urging the justices to hear the appeal and overturn the ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago.
The animal protection group told the court that it had used similar tactics in its protest activities and had also been sued under the RICO law. The civil rights group said the case concerned the principle of "nonviolent direct action."
The defendants also asked the Supreme Court to examine the First Amendment implications of finding political protesters liable under the RICO statute, but the justices did not grant review on that issue.
Although it was invoked in a civil context, the Hobbs Act is an important criminal law, carrying a 20-year prison sentence. Dating to 1946, the law is controversial in states'-rights circles because it gives federal prosecutors and courts jurisdiction over an array of offenses that would ordinarily be state crimes. "The Seventh Circuit's interpretation has the potential to federalize all manner of traditional state offenses," the defendants told the justices.
Urging the court not to take the case, the National Organization for Women said that peaceful protest was never at issue. Rather, NOW said, the case grew out of a "14-year siege of clinics across the country" that involved intimidation and harassment of doctors and patients as well as trespass and assault.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL; 
Baseball's Last Are in First, for Now

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
It has been only a couple of months since Commissioner Bud Selig aborted his winter-long effort to eliminate the Montreal Expos and Minnesota Twins. Not only did the two economically challenged teams not go quietly, but they are also in first place in their respective divisions.
 So are the Pittsburgh Pirates. A team with a losing record each of the previous nine seasons, the Pirates have the best record in the National League. 
 The Expos have thrust themselves to the top of the N.L. East -- ahead of the perennial champion Atlanta Braves, ahead of the forever hopeful Mets -- with their hitting. The Pirates sit atop the N.L. Central because of their pitching and defense. The Twins have achieved first place in the American League Central with a little bit of this and a little bit of that.
The Montreal story is the most intriguing because the team was not only targeted for extinction, but it also remains in limbo under the unprecedented ownership of Major League Baseball.
"People say, 'I'll bet you hope they don't succeed,' " Selig said yesterday, speaking of the Expos and the Twins. "The opposite is true. I hope they're successful."
Although the Expos are playing under the pressure of an uncertain future, through their first 19 games, 11.7 percent of their 162-game schedule, they lead the league in runs, hits, walks, batting average and on-base percentage. Their position reflects a hitting discipline and a devotion to team play that have been instilled in them by their new manager, Frank Robinson.
"It starts with the leadership of Frank Robinson and the coaching staff," said Omar Minaya, who as the team's new general manager has made his own contributions to the good start. "They've done a very good job of communicating to the players the concept of playing for the team."
Minaya and Robinson did not have long to lay the groundwork for their stewardship of the lame-duck Expos. They were named, along with Tony Tavares, the club president, only days before spring training began.
Understanding the importance of communication with the team's players, who represented eight countries and Puerto Rico in spring training, Minaya and Robinson hired coaches that spoke their languages, including a Japanese strength and conditioning specialist.
"We wanted to put together an experienced staff that would instill trust in the players," Minaya said by telephone from Montreal yesterday.
As for the team's uncertain status -- it could still be eliminated or moved to the Washington area -- Minaya said the subject was addressed at the first team meeting in spring training and has rarely been raised internally since.
"We said this is a reality; it's going to be talked about all year," Minaya said. "We can't control it. What we can control is what goes on between the white lines. We're going to play 162 games this year, and we're going to play to win as many of those games as possible."
Minaya told of a man and his adult son who approached him Sunday during the game with the Mets.
" 'You guys are doing a great job,' " Minaya quoted the man as saying. " 'Thank you. I used to come to 40 games a year, but in the past couple of years I stopped coming. Today is my first day back. I know there's no guarantee beyond this year, but I'm going to start coming to games because what you guys have done is good baseball work.' "
At least some Montreal fans have become excited about the Expos' early success. Each of the two weekend games with the Mets attracted more than 11,000 people in a city whose interest in baseball has shrunk to an almost unrecognizable size.
"We get 11,000 people and we give each other high-fives," Minaya said.
The Twins, whose owner, Carl Pohlad, still favors contraction, have drawn enough fans that their average attendance, 22,934, is a shade below the average attendance (23,788) of the Milwaukee Brewers, whom Selig operated before he became commissioner and who are in their second season in a new park. The Twins are drawing better than the Pirates (22,596), who are also in their second season in a new park.
The Twins' first-place position, though, is not as surprising as that of the Expos and the Pirates because they spent more time in first place last season than the Cleveland Indians, who won the division title.
Terry Ryan, the Twins' general manager, did not return a telephone call to talk about the team, but he was apparently not busy making postseason plans just yet.
The Twins climbed to first by sweeping a three-game series from the Indians, who had swept a four-game series from them 10 days earlier. The Indians won 11 of their first 12 games, then lost six straight before beating the Chicago White Sox last night.
The Pirates, who were the only team in the league to lose 100 games last season, have their best record and their first winning record after 17 games, 12-5, since 1992, the last time they finished in first place.
They have achieved it primarily behind their pitching staff, whose 3.10 earned run average is the league's third best. Josh Fogg has a 2-0 record and a 1.89 E.R.A., Jimmy Anderson a 2-1 record and a 2.61 E.R.A., and Dave Williams a 2-1 record and a 2.65 E.R.A., each in three starts. Mike Williams, the closer, has eight saves in eight chances and has allowed one run in nine innings.
Dave Littlefield, the Pirates' general manager, won't allow himself to become too excited over the start.
"The reality is we've done very well and we're happy," he said yesterday by telephone from Pittsburgh. "But this is a long season, and we don't know what we have with those starters. We have had three turns of the rotation. We need a little more time to determine what we have."

MEMO PAD

BYLINE:  By JOE SHARKEY 

 BODY:
Another Day, Another Retreat
The airlines' latest attempt to raise leisure fares by $20 collapsed again yesterday, thanks in large part to the revolt by business travelers against the high cost of flying and Northwest Airlines' apparent eagerness to exploit their anger to its advantage.
 Terry Trippler, the Minneapolis-based airline consultant and fare expert who has been highly critical of Northwest in the past, said yesterday that he was impressed by its refusal to join in the most recent fare increase. "I have got to say, they are staying on message brilliantly," Mr. Trippler said. "They are flexing their cash muscle, and I think they are going in for the kill." 
 On Thursday, as it had done a week before, AMR's American Airlines raised a large number of leisure fares by $20. Competitors, as usual, quickly matched the increases. But by yesterday, after Northwest again bucked the trend -- accompanied this time by UAL's United Airlines -- the initiative dissolved into another embarrassing retreat by the money-hemorrhaging airlines. Among the top five airlines, "American, Delta and United are burning cash very fast," Mr. Trippler said. Though Continental Airlines and Northwest are in better cash-flow shape, the major airlines in general are in severe financial distress.
"There is no room for further financial setbacks in the industry, and in fact some carriers might not survive the year," warned Jim Corridore, an airline analyst with Standard & Poor's, in a recent report.
With a competitive eye on angry business travelers, Northwest "has been repeating the mantra" that now is not the time to raise fares, said Mr. Trippler, who thinks the carrier's hard-ball strategy is aimed at finishing off or greatly damaging a competitor or two.

Judge Denounces Cramped Seating
As if the airlines didn't have enough to worry about, the long-simmering issue of deep-vein thrombosis keeps raising its head, with a growing threat of substantial liability. Deep-vein thrombosis, caused by physical immobility that can create a potentially fatal blood clot, is sometimes referred to as "economy class syndrome" when applied to air travel, an allusion to tight seating in economy class. In Britain, where several deep-vein thrombosis deaths have been laid to long flights, a judge last week denounced cramped airline seating as he upheld a damage claim filed by a passenger against an air charter operator. 
According to The Independent, Judge Gareth Edwards said that the 29-inch distance between coach seats on the charter's Boeing 767 was "intolerable" over an eight-hour international flight. Airlines should allow at least 34 inches between all seats, the judge said in a widely quoted opinion.
On that topic, there is a very useful survey on economy-class seating among the world's scheduled airlines in the May issue of Business Traveler Magazine. The survey lists coach-class seat pitch (the distance between your seat back and the back of the one in front of you), seat width and recline angles for most planes.

Private Jets Continue to Gain
The growth in private jets continues. According to the Business Travel Coalition's annual survey on business travel, to be released today, nearly 36 percent of major domestic companies said that they had increased their use of fractionally owned jets, charter aircraft, corporate air shuttles and corporate-owned aircraft last year over the year before. And 33 percent said they planned to use private jets more this year according to the survey, which was sponsored by Unisys. JOE SHARKEY

HEADLINE: ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: CREDIT RATINGS; 
Credit Raters Get Scrutiny And Possibly A Competitor

BYLINE:  By LESLIE WAYNE 

 BODY:
For years, Sean J. Egan has been trying to crack the cartel consisting of Moody's Investors Service Inc., Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings, credit-ratings agencies with quasi-government authority and enormous global influence.
 Mr. Egan, who runs a much smaller credit analysis firm in suburban Philadelphia, maintains that his judgment calls have been just as good -- if not better -- than those of the Big Three. But his pleas have been largely ignored by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulates credit agencies, and the marketplace has continued to confer rich margins on his competition. 
 But now, in the wake of Enron, Mr. Egan may at last get his hearing before the S.E.C., if not some satisfaction. 
Already, the ratings agencies, which pass judgment on the financial health of companies and evaluate trillions of dollars in debt securities, have been hauled before Congress to explain why they failed to warn investors about Enron's problems.
Spurred on by that Congressional concern, the S.E.C. has announced that it will begin hearings on the industry -- including the regulations that have limited the business of debt rating to an oligopoly of three.
"We want to understand the whole rating organization industry and it's operations," said Isaac C. Hunt Jr., an S.E.C. commissioner. "This is something we haven't re-examined in a long, long time."
Among the topics that the S.E.C. plans to review are the economic barriers to entry, whether new consulting businesses started by some ratings agencies raise conflict of interest issues and whether the current regulatory system should be scrapped entirely and replaced with something else. 
For Mr. Egan, the re-examination is long overdue. Since 1998, Mr. Egan's company, the Egan-Jones Ratings Company, has been seeking the S.E.C. designation needed to give his ratings a government stamp of approval. That designation would give his opinions the same standing in the debt markets as those from Moody's or S.& P., allowing him to expand beyond his current business of providing ratings only to a group of private clients.
At the moment, Mr. Egan says he is in a Catch-22. The S.E.C. has rejected his application because he lacks a large enough staff. But he says he cannot expand his business until he gets the S.E.C. designation. 
"First they wouldn't return our phone calls, and after that they basically indicated they wanted us to become bigger," Mr. Egan said of his dealings with the S.E.C. 
In 1975, in the wake of the default of the Penn Central Corporation, the S.E.C. set out criteria for what it termed Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations. The goal was to prevent unscrupulous companies from selling triple-A ratings to the highest bidder, but the practical effect has been to create an oligopoly protecting Moody's, S.& P. and Fitch while keeping others, like Mr. Egan's firm, out. 
Critics say that the arrangement has allowed the agencies to become enormously profitable while shielding them from the consequences of bad calls.
"These guys don't face any competition," said Lawrence J. White, a professor of economics at the Stern School of Business of New York University. "They don't have to worry if someone else is asking harder questions or breaking the news. They are protected from the fresh winds of competitions. There are only three, and their small number makes them powerful."
Leo C. O'Neill, the president of S.& P., a unit of the McGraw-Hill Companies, said that he had nothing to fear from new competitors. "The fact investors use us speaks for itself," he said. "They would not use ratings if the quality was not outstanding. We survey investors frequently, formally and informally. They are pleased with what we do. I'll stand by that." 
None of the three -- Moody's and S.& P. are the largest and Fitch is a distant third -- disclose much of the thinking behind their ratings decisions, like the questions that companies refuse to answer or the information used to reach conclusions about a company's health. They are also exempt from the S.E.C.'s rules on corporate disclosure, meaning that corporations can give them sensitive information without having to share it with other market analysts.
Moreover, the ratings agencies have some of the same protections that news organizations enjoy under the First Amendment. As a result, nearly every time they have been sued by disgruntled investors over a call gone bad, they have invoked their free speech protections to prevail in court. 
So far, the S.E.C. has not said when it will begin its examination, let alone predicted where it will lead. One possible outcome is that others will be given the Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations designation; another is that the designation could be eliminated entirely, leaving the market to decide whose credit analyses are good and whose are not. 
One thing is clear: Gaining a government designation as a rating agency is like getting a winning lottery ticket. 
"Moody's and S.& P. are the closest thing to the regulators handing a company a free pass at a corporate A.T.M. machine," said Glenn L. Reynolds, chief executive of CreditSights Inc., a provider of investment analysis for institutional investors.
Only one of the three, Moody's, is publicly traded. Its financial statements provide a window into a business in which S.& P. has a 41 percent market share, Moody's has a 38 percent market share and Fitch has most of the remainder.
With no investment in costly plant and equipment and minimal debt, Moody's profit margins are 50 percent. So it is not surprising that investors have flocked to Moody's stock, which is up more than 33 percent in the last year. The buyers have included Warren E. Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway owns 15 percent of the company.
"Moody's is the best franchise I've ever covered in my 20 years on Wall Street," said Kevin R. Gruneich, an analyst at Bear, Stearns. "These companies are not capital intensive and the macro trends for them are pretty awesome." 
He estimates that S.& P., a more diversified company than Moody's, has margins of a lower, but still enviable, 30 percent. 
"The wind is at their backs," Mr. Gruneich said of the Big Three.
Critics, however, look at these numbers and question what the investing public is getting in return. Over the years, they note, the agencies have missed a lot of big calls, from failing to sound the alarm on New York's debt crisis in the mid-1970's, to the bankruptcy of Orange County, Calif., 20 years later to the rot at Enron.
Last fall, when most of the bad news about Enron was public and the company's stock was trading at $3 a share, all three agencies maintained Enron's investment-grade status. Critics in Congress have focused on calls that the agencies received from Wall Street bankers, who were worried that a downgrade would jeopardize their loans to Enron. When the downgrading finally came, it began the process that drove the company into bankruptcy court.
"Their performance on Enron was abysmal," said Frank Partnoy, a professor at the University of San Diego law school and an expert on credit risk. "Based on the information available, they should have asked Enron hard questions months and months earlier. The ratings agency didn't even make the basic level of inquiry that you would have expected of responsible, sophisticated investors. A group of investors could have performed the same service as the ratings agency, simply by reading the newspaper." 
The ratings agencies say that they were defrauded by Enron executives who lied to them, and that they were blindsided like everyone else. "Enron was truly an anomaly," said Fran Laserson, a spokeswoman for Moody's. "By and large, investors believe we do a good job at what we do."
Such self-congratulatory talk aside, some say that the industry's batting average will improve only through competition. That is certainly Mr. Egan's argument.
"On Enron, we were way ahead of Moody's and S.& P.," said Mr. Egan, who downgraded Enron's debt a month before the other agencies. "We argue the ratings firms have fallen far short of protecting investors. Hopefully Enron will get Washington to review the rules."

HEADLINE: The Angry People 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
A slightly left-of-center candidate runs for president. In a rational world he would win easily. After all, his party has been running the country, with great success: unemployment is down, economic growth has accelerated, the sense of malaise that prevailed under the previous administration has evaporated.
 But everything goes wrong. His moderation becomes a liability; denouncing the candidate's pro-market stance, left-wing candidates -- who have no chance of winning, but are engaged in politics as theater -- draw off crucial support. The candidate, though by every indication a very good human being, is not a natural campaigner; he has, say critics, "a professorial style" that seems "condescending and humorless" to many voters. Above all, there is apathy and complacency among moderates; they take it for granted that he will win, or that in any case the election will make little difference. 
 The result is a stunning victory for the hard right. It's by and large a tolerant, open-minded country; but there is a hard core, maybe 20 percent of the electorate, that is deeply angry even in good times. And owing to the peculiarities of the electoral system, this right-wing minority prevails even though more people actually cast their votes for the moderate left. 
If all this sounds like a post-mortem on the Gore campaign in 2000, that's intentional. But I'm actually describing Sunday's shocking election in France, in which the current prime minister, Lionel Jospin, placed third, behind the rabid rightist Jean-Marie Le Pen. Until very recently, Mr. Le Pen was regarded as a spent force. Now he has scored an astonishing triumph.
As I've implicitly suggested, there are some important parallels between the earthquake in French politics and recent political events in the United States. Let me draw out those parallels, then go to the big difference.
What the French election revealed is that in France, as in the United States, there are a lot of angry people. They aren't a majority; Mr. Le Pen received about 17 percent of the vote, less than Ross Perot got here in 1992. But they are highly motivated, and can exert influence out of proportion to their numbers if moderates take a tolerant society for granted. 
What are the angry people angry about? Not economics; peace and prosperity did not reconcile them to Bill Clinton or to Mr. Jospin. Instead, it seems to be about traditional values. Our angry right rails against godless liberals; France's targets immigrants. In both cases, what really seems to bother them is the loss of certainty; they want to return to a simpler time, one without that disturbing modern mix of people and ideas.
And in both cases this angry minority has had far more influence than its numbers would suggest, largely because of the fecklessness of the left and the apathy of moderates. Al Gore had Ralph Nader; Mr. Jospin had a potpourri of silly leftists (two Trotskyists took 10 percent of the vote). And both men were mocked and neglected by complacent moderates.
Now for the important difference. Mr. Le Pen is a political outsider; his showing in Sunday's election puts him into the second-round runoff, but he won't actually become France's president. So his hard-right ideas won't be put into practice anytime soon. 
In the United States, by contrast, the hard right has essentially been co-opted by the Republican Party -- or maybe it's the other way around. In this country people with views that are, in their way, as extreme as Mr. Le Pen's are in a position to put those views into practice.
Consider, for example, the case of Representative Tom DeLay. Last week Mr. DeLay told a group that he was on a mission from God to promote a "biblical worldview," and that he had pursued the impeachment of Bill Clinton in part because Mr. Clinton held "the wrong worldview." Well, there are strange politicians everywhere. But Mr. DeLay is the House majority whip -- and, in the view of most observers, the real power behind Speaker Dennis Hastert. 
And then there's John Ashcroft.
What France's election revealed is that we and the French have more in common than either country would like to admit. There as here, there turns out to be a lot of irrational anger lurking just below the surface of politics as usual. The difference is that here the angry people are already running the country.

HEADLINE: The Jolt In a Victory On the Right 

BYLINE:  By Philip H. Gordon; Philip H. Gordon is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and the author of "The French Challenge: Adapting to Globalization."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The success of Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the National Front, in the first round of the French presidential election is rightly being called a political earthquake in France. With 17 percent of the vote, Mr. Le Pen eliminated Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and won the right to a second-round runoff with President Jacques Chirac. But the shock waves are being felt well beyond French borders.
 European leaders find that some 40 percent of the French voted for candidates deeply hostile to the European Union, including Mr. Le Pen and others on the far right and far left. It is an issue for all of France's trade partners that half of the votes went to anti-globalization candidates. And Arabs and Jews around the world, divided on so much else, must be equally dismayed by the success of a man who has for decades blamed Arab immigrants for crime and unemployment problems and who once described gas chambers as no more than a "detail" in the history of World War II. 
 In the United States, Mr. Le Pen's victory will do little to enhance trust and confidence in France -- an ally that has its problems in Washington in the best of times. Already over the past several months the United States has gone through one of its periodic bouts of francophobia, the frustration Americans feel toward France as the European country least ready to salute and follow American instructions. This time, many Americans are distressed by the French tilt toward the Palestinians, which many see as intended to appease France's Arab population; by France's unwillingness, apparently for commercial reasons, to support ridding Iraq of Saddam Hussein; and, most important, by the outbreak of anti-Semitic vandalism and violence in France.
The anti-French sentiments, particularly strong, and rising, among conservatives and hard-liners in the Bush administration, will only be reinforced by the election result. Beyond the apparent vote against free trade and the support for the extreme right (20 percent of the voters chose either Mr. Le Pen or Bruno Megret, his former ally), there is support for the far left. Three Trotskyites together took more than 11 percent of the vote; the Communist Party candidate, 3 percent; and the Green candidate, 5 percent.
The impression of a France in the hands of extremists or on the verge of a fascist takeover -- some French commentators on election night did not hesitate to make allusions to Germany in 1933 -- needs to be put in perspective. While Mr. Le Pen's defeat of Mr. Jospin was indeed shocking, the overall election result was not far out of line with those in other recent elections. In the last presidential election, in 1995, for example, Mr. Le Pen won 15 percent in the first round of voting, and in 1988 he took 14 percent.
This election confirmed well-established trends toward the fragmentation of the French political system and the rejection of ruling parties. In this particular case, a combination of political factors, along with the peculiarities of France's two-round presidential electoral system, produced a result that gives the impression of a much greater shift than has actually taken place. In fact, Mr. Le Pen defeated Mr. Jospin by less than 1 percent.
One critical factor in the rise in support for marginal candidates was the similarities in the platforms of the main candidates, Mr. Chirac and Mr. Jospin. Ever since former President Francois Mitterrand's disastrous left-wing experiment of the early 1980's, French Socialists have gradually moved to the center and accepted the need for a market economy, European integration and the Atlantic alliance. By the 1990's, this Socialist pragmatism was so ingrained that Mr. Jospin found himself in a government whose economic platform focused on issues like fiscal austerity, privatization, free trade and lower taxes. To win over centrist voters he even adopted familiar right-wing themes like the need to crack down on crime. The result was that French voters who felt they wanted an alternative to mainstream policies or to longtime leaders had to opt for parties out of the mainstream, and they did so in droves.
Another key issue was the perceived need to fight rising crime, which for the first time in nearly 20 years voters said was a greater concern to them than unemployment. This factor worked strongly against the two leaders who have been in power as the issue of personal security has risen, and it played right into the hands of Mr. Le Pen, who has called for draconian anticrime measures for years.
The most important factor, however, was a voting system that magnified these trends. Reassured by the press and opinion polls that a Jospin-Chirac runoff in the second round was a virtual certainty, nearly 28 percent of French voters, an unprecedented proportion, simply stayed home. Among those who turned out was a disproportionally high number of supporters of one extreme or another, plus many who wrongly saw the first round as an opportunity to send a message of disaffection to their leaders without any real political effect. Presumably, had many of those who voted for other center-left or even more extreme left candidates known that their votes might lead to the demise of Mr. Jospin and the success of Mr. Le Pen, the outcome would have been very different and hardly noticed in the international news.
Yet though the impression of great change is overblown, the French know that their reputation as a solid European and Atlantic ally committed to liberal values and integration in the world economy has been shaken by the electoral result. With Round 2 of the presidential contest set for May 5 and two rounds of legislative elections coming in June, the majority in France will be eager to restore it.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
A Dumpster on the stage and a Lorna Doone under every seat at the ad conference.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

DATELINE: DANA POINT, Calif. 

 BODY:
 HERE are a few of the highlights, lowlights and sidelights of the 2002 Management Conference of the American Association of Advertising Agencies, held last week at the Ritz-Carlton Laguna Niguel hotel here.

IT PAYS TO ADVERTISE? -- In an instance of turnabout being fair play, the attendees of the conference, who are the senior managers of the agencies that inundate Americans with advertising, became the targets for some sales pitches and ploys.
 When attendees returned to their rooms after general sessions, receptions and dinners, they found brochures under their doors and on their desks from companies like AdMedia Partners, which specializes in investment banking and strategic services for agencies, and the Sanders Consulting Group, which helps agencies prospect for new business.
Trade publications were also delivered to the rooms, including Ad Age Global, Advertising Age, Creativity and Adweek.
One speaker, Mary Kay Haben, group vice president at the North American division of Kraft Foods, had goody bags placed at the seats of all attendees at the general session Thursday, which contained Kraft products like Altoids mints, Kool-Aid, Ritz crackers and Chips Ahoy and Lorna Doone cookies.
And late one night in the hotel's lobby bar, Gad Romann, chief executive at the Romann Group in New York, handed out brochures promoting his agency.

SIGNS OF THE TIMES -- There was evidence at the conference of the sluggish economy apart from the attendance, which dropped to about 300 from 320 last year and 450 in the boom year of 2000. When attendees checked into the Ritz-Carlton, there was a discount certificate along with the room keys, good for a $20 credit toward purchases of $100 or more at the gift shop, in a restaurant or when ordering room service.

ALCOHOL ONLINE? -- At a reception Thursday sponsored by the America Online division of AOL Time Warner, a sign at the bar declared, "You've Got Martinis!" The sign presented a menu of 10 drinks, each bearing the name of an America Online brand like the Moviefone Cosmopolitan; the Netscape Apple Martini, which proved a favorite; and the ICQ Lemon Drop. Perhaps there ought to have been an 11th drink, the AOL Time Warner Stock Drop.

YOU'VE GOT MAIL -- FINALLY -- For the last several years, America Online and other companies have provided computers at the annual conference, where attendees may check their e-mail messages without charge. Most years, the computers sat unused, because many of the top agency executives who attended the conference were the types who were unable to read their e-mail messages unless their assistants or secretaries had printed them out. This time, though, it appears as if Madison Avenue has joined the 21st century, as the computers were constantly busy; there were occasionally even short lines to wait to use them.

DOWN IN THE DUMPSTER -- Each year, during a business session that starts the conference, the secretary-treasurer of the association delivers his or her annual report in an elaborate, humorous presentation. The report last year, from J. Melvin Muse, chief executive at Muse Creative Holdings in New York, had widely been deemed the most clever and creative, but the one delivered Wednesday by his successor, Marsha Lindsay, chief executive at Lindsay, Stone & Briggs in Madison, Wis., may have topped it.
Ms. Lindsay began her presentation inside a Dumpster, which had been placed next to a long conference table at which the officers of the association sat. The Dumpster, of course, was meant to symbolize the type of year the industry suffered through in 2001.
Ms. Lindsay then tossed fanciful objects from the container as if ransacking it for her report. Out came the Pets.com sock puppet and a batch of "Mariah Carey new-album press releases." She then emerged from the Dumpster along with two confederates who pretended to be laid-off agency employees, whom she wished well at "that job interview next week at Kmart."
Despite the difficult year, Ms. Lindsay said, the association ended with a surplus of $183,000 ("Ta-dah!") and she passed around glasses of ginger ale to celebrate, explaining, "I don't want to spring for Champagne." She promised to serve next time "a new product being directed to the ad agency business, the Try to Be Happy Meal," which was described as containing "a martini, a shot of espresso and a Xanax."

SACRE BLEU -- At a reception Thursday, Patrick J. McGrath, chairman and chief executive at Arnold McGrath Worldwide in New York, part of the Arnold Worldwide Partners division of Havas Advertising, greeted Linda Wolf, chairwoman and chief executive at Leo Burnett Worldwide in Chicago, a division of the Bcom3 Group. Bcom3 is being acquired by the Publicis Groupe, which like Havas is a French-owned agency company.
"Are you taking French lessons?" Mr. McGrath asked Ms. Wolf, laughing. Then he offered her a shortcut by sharing a word that may prove particularly useful: "Oui."

THEY ALL LAUGHED -- Wayne Cotter, the comedian who entertained at the dinner Thursday, apparently did some preparation for the gig. That became apparent with one of his first jokes, as he read from a banner hanging behind him with the association's logo of four large letter A's.
"AAAA," Mr. Cotter said, letting his voice trail off as if he were plunging off a cliff. "Sounds like an industry that's been in free fall for a year."

HIRE LEARNING -- After a speech Friday by John J. Dooner Jr., chairman, president and chief executive at the Interpublic Group of Companies in New York, Ken Kaess, who works for another large agency company, the Omnicom Group, as president and chief executive at DDB Worldwide in New York, asked the audience for questions.
Mr. Kaess pretended there had been a question asking "When is Interpublic going to hire Ken Kaess for a gazillion dollars?" If he were indeed to join Interpublic, he added, John D. Wren, the president and chief executive at Omnicom in New York, would be upset.
Mr. Dooner riposted, "John Wren will be less likely to sue me than the other guy." That drew loud laughter from members of the audience who recognized Mr. Dooner's reference to Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive at the WPP Group in London, who is suing Interpublic for hiring away the top WPP human resources executive, Brian Brooks.

MEMBERSHIP HAS ITS PRIVILEGES? -- In a speech Friday on outstanding creative work from West Coast agencies, Chuck McBride, North American creative director for TBWA/Chiat/Day in San Francisco, part of the TBWA Worldwide division of Omnicom, singled out a handful of agencies for special praise.
One was Goodby, Silverstein & Partners in San Francisco, also owned by Omnicom, for being "consummate storytellers," and another was Wieden & Kennedy in Portland, Ore., because "the work that comes out of that place is true popular culture as opposed to nuts-and-bolts advertising."
Alas, neither Goodby, Silverstein nor Wieden & Kennedy are members of the association and in fact have refused to join for many years.

TIME TO LOOK AHEAD -- During the general session Friday, four senior editors of Time magazine, part of the Time Inc. division of AOL Time Warner, offered perspectives on the past, the terrorist attacks; the present, the Middle East crisis; and the future, the 2004 presidential election.
Michael Duffy, assistant managing editor and Washington bureau chief of Time, predicted that if Vice President Dick Cheney did not run again, President Bush would replace him with Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, because Mr. Rumsfeld meets two criteria that Mr. Cheney had met for a Bush running mate: "You have to be at the end of your career. And want nothing."
In that case, said Jim Kelly, managing editor of Time, the perfect replacement would be Senator Strom Thurmond, Republican of South Carolina.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: PAKISTAN; 
4 on Trial Plead Not Guilty To Murder of U.S. Reporter

BYLINE:  By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: KARACHI, Pakistan, April 22 

 BODY:
A British-born Islamic militant, Ahmed Omar Sheikh, and three co-defendants pleaded not guilty today to the kidnapping and murder earlier this year of the Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl.
 One by one, from behind a barred enclosure, the handcuffed defendants answered, "No," when asked by the judge if they pleaded guilty, according to lawyers who were present. 
 After they entered their plea, the prosecutor, Raja Qureshi, called his first witness, a taxi driver who said he drove Mr. Pearl to a meeting with Mr. Sheikh on the evening of Jan. 23, the day the reporter disappeared. 
The press and public have been barred from the high-profile trial, which is being conducted by a special antiterrorism court inside the secure walls of Karachi's central jail. The makeshift courtroom is heavily guarded but nearly empty, with only three relatives of defendants permitted to attend as spectators.
The charges -- murder, kidnapping for ransom and terrorist activities -- carry the death penalty.
President Pervez Musharraf, who was badly embarrassed by his government's failure to rescue Mr. Pearl, has already said he believes that Mr. Sheikh is guilty and should be executed. The prosecutor conceded last week, however, that he had only circumstantial evidence to implicate Mr. Sheik.
The United States has sought his extradition to face kidnapping and murder charges in this case. It had already sought to extradite him in connection with the earlier kidnapping of an American, along with two Britons, in India in 1994.
Mr. Sheikh, 28, remained calm and composed today, according to his lawyer, Abdul Waheed Katpar, but repeated his objection to being tried in what he called a British colonial court system.
A former student at the London School of Economics, Mr. Sheikh has a quick wit and boyish charm that helped him lure his previous victims in India. He was convicted of that kidnapping and imprisoned in India but was released in 1999 along with other Islamic militants in exchange for the release of passengers on a hijacked airplane.
Judge Abdul Ghafoor Memon ruled today that the cases of seven other defendants who have evaded arrest would be separated from those tried now and would be taken up only if they were captured. Prosecutors say they believe that the actual killer of Mr. Pearl is among the absent defendants.
The other men on trial today were Salman Saqib, Fahad Naseem and Sheikh Muhammad Adeel.
Mr. Pearl, who was the South Asia correspondent for his newspaper, disappeared while researching possible Pakistani connections to Richard C. Reid, a Briton who was arrested last December on an airliner with explosives in his shoe. The accusation against Mr. Sheikh is that he deceived the reporter by promising to arrange a clandestine interview with an Islamic militant leader.
After the abduction, news organizations received two e-mail messages containing photographs of Mr. Pearl in captivity and with a gun to his head. On Feb. 21, the American Consulate here received a graphic videotape, which has never been publicly released, showing Mr. Pearl's killing.
The prosecutor, Mr. Qureshi, said two of Mr. Sheikh's co-defendants had admitted sending the e-mail messages, which they said had been dictated to them by Mr. Sheikh.
"They have yet to be examined in court," he said, "but they have made statements to the effect that the handwritten transcripts recovered from Omar Sheikh at the time of his arrest are the same texts they reduced into e-mail and sent by e-mail. They said he told them to make them into e-mail."
The taxi driver witness today, Nasir Abbas, linked Mr. Sheikh with Mr. Pearl on the day of his disappearance in Karachi.
"He has on oath implicated Omar Sheikh to the effect that on the 23rd, in the evening, he had driven Mr. Pearl to the Village Restaurant, adjacent to the Metropole Hotel, where there was a white Corolla car, and it was Omar Sheikh who got down from the car and took Daniel Pearl with him," the prosecutor said after court adjourned today.
"Mr. Pearl had gotten down from the car, and Omar Sheikh got out of his car, and they met and spoke to each other out of the hearing of the driver," he said, "and thereafter Omar Sheikh took him into the car."
Mr. Sheikh's lawyer said he had questioned the driver's ability to identify the defendant and raised a suggestion that the entire testimony was a fabrication.
"He admitted that his brother is a constable and that another brother is also employed by a government department," said the lawyer, Mr. Katpar. He said the driver had also admitted that he did not talk about the event until some time afterward.
"The implication is that it is a false statement," Mr. Katpar said.
In addition, he said, it was not until three weeks after the disappearance -- on March 6, when Mr. Sheikh was arrested -- that the driver identified him, from a police lineup. "This unusual amount of time is sufficient to make it not reliable," he said.
Mr. Qureshi, the prosecutor, said he planned to call 30 more witnesses, including two F.B.I. agents who helped trace the e-mail messages, and Marianne Pearl, Mr. Pearl's widow. Because she is about to give birth to their child in France, he said, her testimony might be taken there by a French judge.
The next witnesses on the prosecution's list, Mr. Katpar said, include two people who may establish an earlier connection between Mr. Pearl and Mr. Sheikh. One is a receptionist at a hotel in Rawalpindi, and the second is a Pakistani reporter for a Japanese news agency.

HEADLINE: With Alaska Exploration Rejected, Senate Looks to Ethanol 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 22 

 BODY:
Now that the Senate has rejected oil and gas exploration in the Alaska wilderness and strict new fuel-efficiency standards for cars and trucks, the most ambitious part of the energy bill likely to be passed this week may be a vast expansion of the amount of ethanol that has to be added to gasoline.
 The senators from New York and California plan to fight the proposal on the Senate floor, arguing that the requirement could increase gasoline prices in their states by as much as 10 cents a gallon. 
 But their chance of success is slim. The ethanol measure was written by Senator Tom Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota, the majority leader, and it is backed by an unusual coalition of interests that include farmers, big oil companies and environmentalists. 
"I do not fool myself," Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, who is leading the opposition to the measure, told the Senate last week, conceding that a "huge group" was against him. But Mr. Schumer, a Democrat, said he was fighting the proposal because it would "hurt consumers dramatically in my state of New York and throughout the country."
Support for ethanol, a clean-burning gasoline additive made mostly from corn and already heavily subsidized, is generally weaker in the House, where lawmakers from corn-growing states have less influence. But this measure is advocated by Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, who has plenty of corn farmers in his state, Illinois, and his position may assure its approval by the Senate-House conference committee on the energy legislation. If so, it cannot be stopped on the House floor without defeating the entire bill.
President Bush, who came out for the expanded use of ethanol when he campaigned in Iowa in 2000, supports the bill before the Senate.
The version of the Clean Air Act adopted in 1990 required refiners who sell fuel in regions where smog is a problem to blend an oxygenate into their gasoline. There are essentially two such additives, methyl tertiary butyl ether, or M.T.B.E., and ethyl alcohol, or ethanol.
M.T.B.E. has been widely used on the East and West Coasts, far from the corn-growing regions. But M.T.B.E. turns out to contaminate ground water, and 14 states, including New York and California, have now prohibited its use.
The energy bill before the Senate, sent to the floor without going through the normal committee process, would ban M.T.B.E. nationwide and eliminate the general requirement for oxygenates in gasoline. But it would require that the amount of ethanol blended into gasoline, now 1.7 billion gallons a year, be increased, to 2.3 billion gallons by 2004 and even more every year afterward until it reaches 5 billion gallons in 2012.
Midwestern farmers like the plan because it would expand the market for corn. Environmentalists favor it because they say they think that it would lead to less air pollution. Oil companies approve because it would reduce the pressure to find another way to produce cleaner gasoline and because the measure specifies that they cannot be held liable if ethanol turns out to be damaging like M.T.B.E. The companies would also not be disappointed if an ethanol shortage developed and gasoline prices rose.
Of course, the legislation also makes the Archer Daniels Midland Company happy. The Illinois company, a big contributor to both political parties, is the largest manufacturer of ethanol.
On Tuesday, Representative Doug Ose, the California Republican who is chairman of the energy subcommittee of the Government Reform Committee, will hold a hearing on whether there is dangerously little competition on the East and West Coasts in producing and supplying ethanol.
Senator Mark Dayton, Democrat of Minnesota, said in addition to reducing pollution, the increased use of ethanol would lessen the reliance on foreign oil. "The alternative to doing nothing with ethanol is doing nothing at all, nothing except increasing our national consumption of gasoline and oil," Mr. Dayton said in the Senate last week.
But Mr. Schumer said the high cost of shipping ethanol would lead to a big increase in the price of gasoline, a rise that would be the equivalent of a new gasoline tax. He would ban M.T.B.E. and abolish the oxygenate standard but make the use of ethanol optional. He would maintain clean air laws and require the companies that sell gasoline to find a way to meet the antipollution requirements in places where using ethanol was not economical.
He is standing up to his party's leaders, Mr. Schumer said, because this type of issue occasionally slips through Congress without much attention, "then, a year or two later, it turns out to be a big disaster."
"Our constituents turn to us," Mr. Schumer went on, "and ask: 'How could you have done this? How could you have created something that has caused so much hardship without even thinking about it, without debating it, without opposing it?' "

HEADLINE: Greenspan Questions Some Implicit U.S. Subsidies 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Implicit subsidies to government-sponsored enterprises, like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, increase the risks to the world's financial system, the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, said in a speech yesterday.
 Without referring to the companies, the top two buyers of home mortgages, by name, Mr. 
Greenspan said these enterprises benefited from "the perception of government support." 
 That, in turn, he said, may induce investors to take less care than they typically would in assessing the riskiness of their securities.
"We need to be careful not to allow subsidies to unduly disturb an efficient financial structure that has so clearly contributed to increased economic stability," Mr. Greenspan told the Institute of International Finance in New York over a satellite hookup from Washington.
In a speech devoted mostly to the benefits and potential risks of derivatives, Mr. Greenspan said the flexibility that these instruments provided to the financial system was one reason that the recent recession might have been shorter and less severe than such periods in the past.
"If the indications that the contraction phase of this business cycle has drawn to a close are ultimately confirmed," he said, echoing his testimony to Congress last week, "we will have experienced a significantly milder downturn than the long history of business cycles would have led us to expect."
He also said, "Remarkably, the imbalances that triggered the downturn and that could have prolonged this difficult period did not fester."
For that, he credited "the combination of deregulation and innovation in the financial sector." He cited derivatives, which include options, interest rate swaps and other financial instruments.
By allowing risks to be shared, the Fed chief said, derivatives "appear to have effectively spread losses from recent defaults" by companies like Enron and Global Crossing.

HEADLINE: Bush, in Adirondacks, Defends Environment Record 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: WILMINGTON, N.Y., April 22 

 BODY:
President Bush hiked into an Adirondacks snowstorm this morning to promote his Clear Skies initiative and defend his administration's environmental record against a new barrage of criticism from Al Gore.
 Earth Day arrived in the mountains of upstate New York with temperatures in the 30's and a wet, heavy snow. To mark the day, Mr. Bush told a friendly audience that Clear Skies would help clean the air and reduce acid rain, one of the single biggest environmental concerns in the Adirondacks. 
 "With Clear Skies legislation, America will do more to reduce power plant emissions than ever before in our nation's history," Mr. Bush told an applauding crowd at the Whiteface Mountain Lodge.
The president got an argument on that claim from Mr. Gore, his opponent in the bitter 2000 presidential campaign. In his own Earth Day speech, in Nashville, Mr. Gore accused the president of selling out the environment to big oil companies and recalled Mr. Bush's campaign promise to curb the emission of carbon dioxide, the gas principally implicated in global warming. Reversing that campaign pledge, Mr. Bush decided in March 2001 not to impose carbon dioxide controls, saying he feared the limits would endanger economic growth. 
Today, when asked about Mr. Gore's accusations as he helped restore a snowy, muddy and very cold mountain trail, the president retorted, "Haven't paid attention to them." When a reporter called out that Mr. Gore was saying Mr. Bush had no environmental record, the president shot back, "That's why I haven't paid attention to him."
The day, which seemed at times a reprise of the 2000 campaign, was blurred by more than just the snowstorm, which moved the president's speech from what would have been a spectacular outdoor setting to the more prosaic surroundings of the cafeteria at the lodge.
For starters, Mr. Bush appeared with one of the few environmental groups that support him, the Adirondacks Council, as well as Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican who recently opposed some of the environmental policies that Mr. Bush promoted today.
Mr. Bush was also accompanied by Representative Sherwood Boehlert, a Republican from upstate New York who is the co-sponsor of a bill that calls for much tougher emissions standards than the Clear Skies initiative.
But all parties had good reason to be here today in this midterm election year, including Mr. Bush, who told the crowd that his visit to the Adirondacks was inspirational in part because it was the playground of a favorite former president.
"In this very park," he said, "Teddy Roosevelt used to hang out."
Members of the Adirondacks Council said they supported the president's initiative because they viewed it as the most practical option for now in controlling acid rain, although, they said, it does not go far enough.
The Clear Skies plan would impose mandatory limits on three kinds of power-plant emissions but grant the plants flexibility in meeting those limits, including the trading of emissions "allowances." The initiative would reduce the emissions of nitrogen oxide, which leads to smog; sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain; and mercury, the last major toxic pollutant not regulated by the Clean Air Act, whose 1990 amendments were signed into law by Mr. Bush's father.
"We think any time you've got a president behind the issue, it gives you a little momentum," said John F. Sheehan, an Adirondacks Council spokesman.
The White House is promoting the initiative as an improvement over the Clean Air Act, one that would significantly reduce the levels of pollutants in the air over the next decade. But many other environmental groups claim the opposite, saying the proposal actually allows more emissions than under the statute.
No one disputes that the Clear Skies initiative does not address carbon dioxide emissions and thus global warming.
Mr. Pataki, who is running for a third term, disagrees with Mr. Bush on another part of the administration's environmental plan. His argument is with the White House's stance on a program called "new source review," which requires power plants to modernize pollution controls when the plants are upgraded. The White House has indicated it wants to relax those rules, and Mr. Pataki has written a letter to Vice President Dick Cheney objecting. 
Today an aide to the governor said Mr. Pataki considered the Clear Skies proposal "an enormous step forward" and would work with the administration on the other issues.
In any case, there was not a discordant note as Mr. Pataki and Mr. Bush, two Yale graduates in khakis and hiking boots, tramped around in the fertile Republican territory of the Adirondacks and together drove numerous nails into planks to help make walkways over a muddy hiking trail along the Au Sable River.
At one point, a White House aide asked watching reporters to move out of the president's way.
"Get them moving," Mr. Bush called out cheerily. "That way I won't have to nail so many of these things."

HEADLINE: Gates Testifies Of Dire Results If Penalties Stand 

BYLINE:  By AMY HARMON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 22 

 BODY:
Bill Gates, the chairman and co-founder of Microsoft, took the witness stand today for the first time in the antitrust case against the company, declaring that the penalties sought by a coalition of state prosecutors would cripple Microsoft, harm consumers and drag the entire computer industry into stagnation.
 Opening his appearance with a multimedia presentation, Mr. Gates could almost have been at an industry trade show. He demonstrated why he believes that the states' proposals would fracture the Windows operating system used by millions of Americans, sowing confusion and driving up prices. 
 "Instead of being able to buy a machine with Windows and knowing that all your applications would run, you wouldn't have that assurance," Mr. Gates said today.
In written testimony submitted before his court appearance, Mr. Gates said Microsoft would be forced to withdraw Windows from the market if Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of Federal District Court adopted the states' demand for a version of the operating system that can be customized by computer makers and software designers.
Mr. Gates's performance was a stark contrast to the combative, evasive persona Mr. Gates projected during a videotaped deposition played for Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of the Federal District Court during the liability phase of the trial.
Wearing a dark blue suit, Mr. Gates was quick to answer questions and strove to appear helpful, frequently responding "yes, sir," to questions from Steven Kuney, a lawyer for the states who conducted his cross-examination.
During the six-week hearing, the states have referred to Microsoft's position as the "Doomsday defense," and Mr. Kuney sought today to portray Mr. Gates's interpretation of the states' proposals as so extreme as to be nonsensical on several fronts.
Mr. Kuney asked "did you mean us to take quite literally," the notion that several of the states' proposals "would lead to the end of innovation and eliminate most of the current employees of Microsoft?"
"That's correct," Mr. Gates answered.
For all the high-profile debate and taxpayer dollars spent on the four-year-old case, the penalty phase of the trial has until now proceeded in relative obscurity. Once the possibility of a Microsoft breakup was all but ruled out by a federal appeals court, the question of how to restrict Microsoft's future conduct has been mired in technical debates and dueling economic projections.
But Mr. Gates's presence underscored the degree to which the company views the outcome of the hearing as vital to the future of the company. His 155-page written testimony, in which he dissects each of the provisions sought by the states, seeks to make Mr. Gates's point that the penalties leave no motivation for the company to continue to be innovative. 
The penalties recommended by the states include requiring Microsoft to share with competitors technical information and blueprints about how some of its most popular software works. In his written testimony, Mr. Gates argued such penalties would cause "a massive transfer of Microsoft's intellectual property rights" to competitors in addition to being impossible to carry out.
In many ways, Mr. Gates's objections to the states' proposals echo the same philosophical and technical disputes that have been at the core of the case since it began. Microsoft has long maintained that there is no clear line between what is in the operating system and what is a separate product because it is all a collection of the electronic 1's and 0's of computer code.
Microsoft hopes that Mr. Gates will persuade a judge who is relatively new to the case not to risk meddling with a company that has long been an economic engine for the technology industry and the American economy.
"The same 'positive feedback loop' that propelled the PC industry to years of steady growth would work in reverse," Mr. Gates warned of states' proposals, "causing the industry to stagnate as products became more expensive to develop even as they provided fewer benefits and less interoperability."
But Mr. Kuney challenged Mr. Gates's assertion that what is good for Microsoft is good for the computer industry: "Most people think when we have a monopoly that the interests of that firm are not always aligned with the interests of the industry, isn't that the case?" Mr. Kuney asked.
Mr. Kuney also questioned Mr. Gates's testimony that Microsoft already goes to great lengths to disclose technical information so software developers can write programs that work well with Microsoft products. He produced an internal memorandum from Mr. Gates instructing employees to stop trying to make Microsoft Office documents work with rival Web browsers.
"We have to stop putting any effort into this," Mr. Gates wrote in the December 1998 e-mail message. "Anything else is suicide for our platform."
"You read it correctly," Mr. Gates said, bristling just slightly.
Throughout most of the afternoon's testimony, however, Mr. Gates remained calm and conversational, refusing to back down from his positions even as Mr. Kuney sought to paint them as absurd. 
The proceeding before Judge Kollar-Kotelly is the culmination of a case that began when the Justice Department and 20 states filed antitrust charges against Microsoft on May 18, 1998, in what was seen as a historic case that would set the ground rules of competition in the digital age.
After a 78-day trial, Judge Jackson ruled that Microsoft had repeatedly violated antitrust laws by using its monopoly power in the market for personal computer operating systems to challenge the Netscape Navigator browser and the Java programming language of Sun Microsystems, rivals to Windows. He ordered the company to be broken in two.
Last year, a federal appeals court upheld several of Judge Jackson's findings but overturned others, including the breakup order. The appeals court directed the district court to impose a penalty based on the revised ruling that would restore competition, deny Microsoft the rewards of its illegal activity and prevent its repetition.
In January, the Bush administration and nine of the states remaining in the litigation settled with Microsoft out of court. But nine other states, along with the District of Columbia, have refused to go along with the terms of the settlement, which has been widely criticized as a sweetheart deal. They argue that unless carefully restrained, Microsoft will repeat the same pattern by illegally seeking to eliminate new challengers to its Windows monopoly.

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Tuesday about the testimony of Bill Gates in Microsoft's antitrust case misstated the timing of a settlement agreement by the Justice Department and nine states. It was in November 2001, not in January.

HEADLINE: THE FRENCH SURPRISE: THE SHOCK; 
French Political Leaders Rally Around Chirac

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE DALEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, April 22 

 BODY:
French political leaders buried their differences today in a bid to present a united front against Jean-Marie Le Pen, the rightist leader whose qualification for the second round of the presidential election has convulsed the country.
 Dominique Strauss-Kahn, a Socialist and former finance minister, said he would support the conservative president, Jacques Chirac, in the second round because "It is the honor of our country that is at stake." 
 But Mr. Le Pen immediately demonstrated a shrewd appreciation of the forces that brought him success. He declared that he was "the candidate of the French people against the candidate of the system." He added, "We are witnessing the toppling of a decadent, corrupt and ossified political system." 
French politics have proved extraordinarily static in recent years even as the country has changed. There is little question that the prospect of more of the same led the French electorate to vote for Mr. Le Pen and relegate Lionel Jospin, the Socialist prime minister, to third place and elimination.
"This vote is the first to sanction the political class for not listening," said Laurence Parisot, of the IFOP polling institute.
Mr. Le Pen's success pointed to significant shifts in the French and European political scenes that suggest it would be wrong to dismiss his qualification for the second round as a mere anomaly, analysts and pollsters said.
Across Europe, several trends have buoyed candidates of the right: a strong reaction to rising crime in the form of a call for more "law and order," a growing uneasiness over high immigration, and a thirst for a different message among voters who feel that traditional parties have moved toward an indistinguishable center. "Anyone who speaks out against excessive and uncontrolled immigration or the abuse of asylum laws in the context of center-right politics is immediately branded an extremist," said Jorg Haider, the Austrian politician whose success provoked French ire two years ago. "But as time goes on, citizens are not putting up with this anymore."
Mr. Le Pen, a former paratrooper who has run for president three times before and has always been popular with the elderly, gained support across the country and with all age groups, particularly among low-income voters who had supported the Communist Party in the past.
He carried several regions in the industrial north, eastern parts of the country where unemployment is relatively high and the southern region of Languedoc-Roussillon. Mr. Chirac carried the center and west of the country, including Paris. Signs of shame were everywhere in France today. "NO" was the headline on the front page of the leftist newspaper Liberation, a terse summary of the widespread incredulity that a man whose politics have been consistently marked by anti-immigrant bigotry could do so so well.
Like the United States, France feels that its values hold a universal message for mankind. It has been quick in recent years to hand out moral lessons to other European nations, like Austria, that have voted heavily for rightist candidates, making its sense of humiliation today that much harder to bear.
Le Monde published a column entitled simply "The Wound." Written by its publisher, Jean-Marie Colombani, it said: "France is wounded. And, for many of the French, humiliated."
High school students marched out of classrooms in Lyon, Strasbourg, Reims, Rouen, Angers and Besancon to hold rallies against Mr. Le Pen, chanting slogans equating him with Hitler and calling his National Front a fascist organization. Tonight, police officers fired tear gas at anti-Le Pen protesters throwing homemade gasoline bombs in central Paris. 
Absolute strangers debated the results in the subways and around newspaper kiosks, stunned that the Socialist Party, which had governed the country for nearly five years, had been eliminated from the presidential race for the first time in decades.
Mr. Le Pen's supporters pledged today to hold a rally on May 1. Unimpressed by the breadth of the opposition lining up against him and snap polls that showed Jacques Chirac, the center-right president, likely to win by a landslide, Mr. Le Pen, 73, went to his Paris headquarters today, cheerfully telling reporters that he was just getting started.
He called on voters who abstained in the first round to vote for him on May 5. "The people of France have decided to use their power to shake up the current system," Mr. Le Pen said. "If you are disheartened, you have the chance to say what you think by voting for me, with your head high and hands clean. 
Bruno Jeanbart, a director at the C.S.A. polling institute, said there was a certain logic to the result because the French did not want to see another race between Mr. Chirac and Mr. Jospin, the Socialist leader, who have ruled for seven and five years respectively as president and prime minister. The two men contested the final round of the 1995 presidential election.
"Overall, the Sunday vote was a protest vote by people who have felt overlooked and forgotten by the system," Mr. Jeanbart said.
Final results of the vote showed that Mr. Le Pen had benefited from a large field of candidates that splintered the vote. With many of the center-left believing that Mr. Jospin's qualification was assured, they voted instead for ecologists or other candidates only to discover that they had contributed to the total eclipse of the French left.
Today, more than one French citizen who decided to skip the voting booth and go for a walk on a warm spring day rued his decision. "The weather was nice" said Benoit Marc, 19, who never got around to casting his ballot. "But yes, I will vote in the second round. The National Front in power? No!"
Some who voted for Mr. Le Pen said they had made their point and would now vote for Mr. Chirac. Camille de Barmon, 20, who sells expensive children's clothes on the Rue de la Paix, said she had voted for Mr. Le Pen to signal her concern about crime. But she never imagined he would beat out Mr. Jospin. 
She said she would not vote for the National Front again. "Le Pen is too excessive and I don't know his policies well," she said. 
With the highest rate of abstention France has ever seen, Mr. Chirac got 19.67 percent of the vote, Mr. Le Pen 17.02 percent and Mr. Jospin trailed with 16.07 percent. 
France's political establishment, so often criticized as slow to change and out of touch, seemed suddenly in the process of being remade. Everywhere there was a sense that the first round vote had catapulted France into a new political era. After months of total indifference to the presidential elections, it was the subject of almost every conversation.
"Even if there is no doubt about the outcome of the run off, and it is already clear that Mr. Chirac will be returned to the Elysee, " said Pierre-Luc Seguillon, an editorialist at the 24-hour news channel LCI, "it is nevertheless also clear that an era of great uncertainty, turbulence, deep political upheaval and institutional change is ahead."
Most immediately, that turbulence will affect the French left. Mr. Jospin announced Sunday night that he would retire as Socialist Party leader and prime minister after second round of voting next month. Today, the Socialists chose the party's secretary, Francois Hollande, to lead its efforts in the legislative elections in June.
The Socialists are in an awkward position. They have now pledged to support Mr. Chirac for the presidency in order to defeat the extreme right. But then within a few weeks they will try to defeat his Gaullist party in the legislative elections.
A lot is at stake in those elections. A French president with the backing of the legislature is extremely powerful. But if the legislature is in the control of another party, the president's powers are severely compromised, as the Gaullist Mr. Chirac has found in trying to govern with Mr. Jospin.
Mr. Chirac huddled today with defeated candidates from other center-right parties to discuss how his campaign should go forward from here. His aides appeared to back away from an earlier suggestion that Mr. Chirac would debate Mr. Le Pen, who is a fiery and sometimes unpredictable orator.
In a debate, Mr. Chirac, 69, who has faced several charges of corruption relating to his time in office as the mayor of Paris, could be exposed to accusations of dishonesty. On the other hand, a decision to refuse to debate Mr. Le Pen in the two weeks before the May 5 runoff could look like weakness.
In the last few years, France has been changing rapidly. After years of high unemployment, the late 1990's brought a a more successful economy and high-flying French executives with global outlooks to go with it. 
But in recent months, unemployment started creeping up again after a long period of decline, providing Mr. Le Pen with more ammunition for his anti-immigrant message.
In almost every sector of society, the French embraced new ideas. But the political establishment remained virtually unchanged. Both Mr. Chirac and Mr. Jospin had been in the forefront of French politics for three decades.
Polls showed that the French were bored and increasingly alienated from their politicians, most of whom are graduates from the same elite schools. In breaking into the race, it appears that Mr. Le Pen will have a powerful effect on the political scene whether he wins or not.
The message seems clear: France does not want an unchanging political class.

What Le Pen Wants to Do
These are changes that Jean-Marie Le Pen would seek to make if elected president of France, according to his campaign web site, www.lepen.tv: 
Outlaw abortion and end official recognition of same-sex unions.
Develop programs to increase the birth rate and pay benefits to women who stay at home with their children.
End legal immigration.
Deport illegal immigrants and eliminate dual nationality. 
Give French citizens priority for all jobs and public housing; create a separate medical benefits system for foreigners working in France, so that French tax money would not be used for foreigners' care.
Allow only French citizens to teach in French schools.
Reinstitute morality classes; require student participation in patriotic events and holidays.
Outlaw the wearing of yarmulkes and Muslim headscarves in schools.
Create 200,000 new prison beds.
Expand and give new rights to the police force.

HEADLINE: Even After Tremors of Sept. 11, Ambitious Building Plans Proceed 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA WHITAKER

 BODY:
IN the wake of Sept. 11, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art set aside plans to announce a sweeping expansion of its space. The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, did the same.
 But fears were allayed that such postponements might signal a slowdown in what is one of the most ambitious building booms ever at museums nationwide. Both the Los Angeles and Boston museums have since unveiled architecturally significant projects. 
"A museum like ours isn't about a single time in an economic cycle -- it's about collections that represent all time," said Andrea Rich, the president and director at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, explaining the decision to move forward with a design for essentially a new building by the Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas (despite its $200 million estimated cost and another $100 million to be raised for an endowment). "At any point you could be in an economic boom or bust."
Attendance dropped at museums with heavy tourist traffic in the months after Sept. 11. Cutbacks in public financing led to layoffs at numerous museums, many in New York. Nonetheless, building projects are showing resilience. Dozens of proposed museum expansions, from San Francisco to Kansas City to Tampa, Fla., are going ahead. 
A January survey by the Association of Art Museum Directors examining the status of these projects found that only about a third of the museums were slowing down or scaling back their plans; only one museum dropped an expansion project.
"It only surprised me because one read such dire predictions after Sept. 11," said James Cuno, the president of the association and the director of the Harvard University Art Museums. "But when one thought about it for a while, it wasn't surprising because building projects are always very long-term projects."
It is not uncommon for a project -- from the planning and analysis through the construction -- to span a decade.
"In a sense, there isn't a wrong time," said Malcolm Rogers, the director of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, where officials are embarking on a $425 million capital campaign. "Just as in the stock market, you can't time the market. A campaign has to begin somewhere."
The lengthy time frame also benefits projects like the one at the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, Mass., which before Sept. 11 had raised $90 million to finance an expansion project. After Sept. 11, the museum went into a planning phase for its fund-raising push this spring, so the timing helped it avoid having to contend with the poor economy.
Still, the current situation calls for caution and rethinking of plans. The most precarious projects are possibly ones that rely heavily on public financing. Budget cuts by the Department of Cultural Affairs in New York might play havoc with projects at a number of museums, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Queens Museum of Art. The picture is more complicated for projects that rely on private giving. Donations are healthy, but revenues from, say, sales subscriptions and services are suffering at some museums.
"I think there is a concern about protecting the normal operating budget and the normal side of the museum's life," said H. King McGlaughon, the director of the Merrill Lynch Center for Philanthropy and Nonprofit Management.
While capital campaigns are separate from operating budgets, they do affect each other, said Mr. McGlaughon, whose center works with about 35,000 nonprofit organizations, about 3,500 of which are museums. 
Harry S. Parker III, the director of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, the city's largest public art institution, acknowledged that strain in discussing plans to build the M. H. de Young Memorial Museum in Golden Gate Park.
"We really are trying very hard not to let the two get entwined, but it's difficult," said Mr. Parker, whose group has made 15 percent budget cuts, mainly through attrition. "It's challenging; you have staff saying, 'How can we afford to start a construction project if we can't replace my secretary when she goes on maternity leave?' "
Yet private donors are enthusiastic about the $165 million de Young project. Of the $154 million raised so far, $100 million has come from 35 individual donors. "I would say if you go out to raise private funds, you need to have some very rich friends," Mr. Parker said.
Rich benefactors are behind many of the proposed expansions. At the Denver Art Museum, a $62.5 million bond initiative will finance construction of an addition that will almost double the museum's space. But an additional $50 million for the museum's endowment was raised by 36 members of the board of trustees.
"I think it's the commitment that these individuals have to the community," said Lewis Sharp, the director of the Denver Art Museum. "When you have something as horrific as Sept. 11, it causes some people to go back and look at core values and what is important to the community."
Cities are increasingly turning to their museums to bolster civic pride. The Milwaukee Art Museum recently opened a new addition designed by Santiago Calatrava, an architect, featuring a 200-foot sunscreen. The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Mo., broke ground last year for an addition aiming to, as the museum said in a statement, "expand and enhance every facet of its programming in the next decade."
In Boston, officials at the Museum of Fine Arts would not say how much money they have raised, but Mr. Rogers, the museum's director, said that the museum was "on track." He anticipated some delays, he said, between the time when financial pledges are made and when money was made available.
"In general, people will be making pledges to a campaign but will want to see some of their stocks increase before they hand over the cash," he said.
But as Ms. Rich in Los Angeles said: "There are good times and bad times. You just begin to plan for a sort of essentially normal future and you just keep putting one foot in front of the other."

HEADLINE: Pooling Their Resources For a Place in the Sun 

BYLINE:  By ANDREA ADELSON

DATELINE: LAGUNA BEACH, Calif. 

 BODY:
HOLLYWOOD, Disneyland, the sun and the surf. With all this, how can museums in Southern California compete for the public's attention? 
 The answer is, they must work together. Twenty museums, large and small, like the J. Paul Getty Museum and the Laguna Art Museum, have set aside their rivalries and, for the last year, have cooperated in marketing their exhibitions and institutions. 
 "We're in competition with movies, TV, the beach and amusement parks for leisure dollars," said Mark A. Thie, the marketing manager for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, which is near downtown Los Angeles. "We need to promote ourselves like any business."
The group has sponsored newspaper advertisements -- which the nine smaller institutions could not have afforded individually -- that celebrate the museums' role in the region's cultural landscape. For instance, a full-page ad on Oct. 24 in The Los Angeles Times read, "We share a vision to inspire and, at times like these, heal and fortify the human spirit." 
"Together, we make more of an impact," said Evelyn C. Davis, the marketing director of the Autry Museum of Western Heritage, which is near the Burbank-Glendale city limits. "There's more culture here than we're given credit for."
Traditionally, Los Angeles and Orange County museums have been reluctant to share resources or advertise together; they have always viewed their collections as specialized and their audiences as distinctive. But research by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art found that museumgoers were not institutionally loyal, that they avidly sampled many different kinds of collections.
"We realize we are all seeking the same things and the same audience," said Susan M. Metcalf, the communications manager for the Bowers Museum of Cultural Art in Santa Ana. "Why not share this audience and inspire it to go to museums in general, rather than divide it?"
The marketing campaign has yielded some unexpected alliances. The Autry Museum, established by the singing-cowboy Gene Autry, is promoting an exhibition at the Museum of Latin American Art in Long Beach on silver-hammered tack used by Mexico's show cowboys, the charrerias.
To promote its June exhibition of Jewish life in the American West, the Autry is considering granting reciprocal membership to members of the Skirball Cultural Center in Los Angeles, which specializes in Jewish culture. The center has also decided to supplement the Autry show by arranging its own exhibition on Jewish pioneer women. 
Such alliances would have been unthinkable a year ago.
While museum financial officers and bookstore operators in Los Angeles and Orange County have long had their own networking groups, there was no established group for museum marketers.
The group's leader is Carol Komatsuka, the marketing vice president of the Japanese American National Museum in downtown Los Angeles. Like most of her peers, Ms. Komatsuka worked in corporate marketing before shifting to the nonprofit sector. But she found that museums were not adequately addressing Southern California's particular cultural challenges, like urban sprawl and a surging immigrant population. The first round table, held last May, included marketing directors from 15 museums. It met with such collegial enthusiasm that she realized there were other museum marketing professionals who, like her, also wanted to share and gain experiences.
Museums elsewhere in the United States may soon be forced to create similar networks. With reduced government financing and declining income from endowments, many museums are squeezing their budgets. The American Association of Museums has urged its members to form alliances, but only a few have done so.
In 1992, nine cultural institutions in Chicago created a consortium called Museums in the Park. The group has hired a lobbyist, Jacqueline Atkins, to emphasize with local lawmakers the museums' economic value to the region. (Government financing to the museums amounts to 18 percent of their budgets.) "It sounds so logical, but it hasn't been part of the museum world," Ms. Atkins said, referring to the lobbying. In 1998, seven institutions in Richmond, Va., established Museums on the Boulevard; one project is to press city officials to redesign an unattractive freeway exit that acts as a gateway to the museum district.
Museums in Los Angeles are busy thinking of new ways to work together. They are granting free admission to employees of other museums, and plan to link Web sites.
All this sharing and collaborating is eroding the stereotype that Southern California is a cultural wasteland. The area's nine most popular visual arts sites drew 4.2 million visitors in 2000, according to the American Association of Museums' fact book. That figure exceeds attendance at the Dodgers home games that year, which was about three million, according to a Dodgers spokeswoman.
Banding together has made the museums stronger, marketing directors say, especially when the marketing resources of one competitor -- Hollywood -- are considered.
"What a studio spends on one movie," Mr. Thie said, "we spend in six years."

HEADLINE: COLLABORATION; 
Getting Liberace And Jimi in Tune

BYLINE:  By BEN SISARIO 

 BODY:
IN the beginning there was country music. The Country Music Hall of Fame, that is, founded in 1967. It is one of the first museums ever devoted to American music, and to the proud culture of personalities and artifacts surrounding it. Long before eBay, the Country Music Hall of Fame was busy acquiring guitars, costumes and Willie Nelson's sneakers. (They're New Balance, displayed proudly in a glass case.)
 Then came the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame, which began inducting members in 1986 and opened to the public nine years later in a gleaming $26 million I. M. Pei pyramid on the shores of Lake Erie in Cleveland. 
 Since then, dozens of music museums have been founded, following their predecessors' lead in canonizing American music. The Experience Music Project, a high-tech museum and archive founded by the Microsoft billionaire Paul Allen, opened in Seattle in 2000 at an expense of $240 million. In Memphis, Soulsville Inc., broke ground on the $20 million Stax Museum of American Soul Music in 1999. The Country Music Hall of Fame itself spent $37 million on a new home in downtown Nashville. It opened in 2001.
The United States has not experienced a museum boom like this since the growth of fine art museums at the turn of the last century. 
"Now the same thing is happening for popular music," said Robert Santelli, the director of the Experience Music Project and a former manager of education and public programs at the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame. "America has come to grips with its rich popular music legacy. Now is the time to preserve it."
As a movement though, the museums are struggling to define themselves. Three years ago, while still in Cleveland, Mr. Santelli started an informal meeting with the representatives of other music museums, to share information and ideas. 
Art museums have long had an extensive connecting network, including groups like the Association of Art Museum Directors and the Association of American Art Museums, an umbrella group that includes history museums and natural history sites as well as art museums. Now, the music museums are trying to organize a similar network. Next month the Experience Music Project plans to announce the Music Museum Alliance, a consortium of more than 40 institutions in the United States and Canada that will meet regularly and have a formal mission statement to share exhibitions and materials, seek strategies for financing and attracting visitors and promote the group's common cause. 
The alliance is a motley assortment of museums, including big institutions like the Experience Music Project, the Library of Congress and the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, and an array of small, specific museums and shrines that read like the random assortment of posters at a record store: the Buddy Holly Center, the Grateful Dead Museum, the Liberace Museum, the International Bluegrass Music Museum and the Monterey Jazz Museum. There are also music industry organizations like the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences.
Some of the museums in the alliance, like the Folk Music Museum in Greenwich Village, do not yet exist. It was conceived in 2000 by a group of folk music veterans in New York City and is still searching for a home and adequate funds.
Art D'Lugoff, who owned the Village Gate club in New York and is the president of the Folk Music Museum, said the alliance was needed both as a source for mutual support and as an informal lobbying group. "It's a chance to communicate with one another," he said. "If something important happens in the government agencies, we have a chance to lobby and fight for what we think is in our best interest."
Mr. Santelli and his associates say that all the museums, large and small, face common problems of attracting audiences and money and presenting their collections.
One very current problem has been the drop in revenue that most music museums, like other museums, have faced since the economic boom ended. Even the richest museums have tightened their belts -- the Experience Music Project laid off 124 employees in January to counteract a 35 percent drop in attendance.
But some issues are more specific to the field, like the rapidly changing nature of popular music, the focus of most of the newer music museums. "We're dealing with extremely current subject matter," said Diana Johnson, a senior vice president for museum services at the Country Music Hall of Fame. "In this business, history is made yesterday."
Bill Ivey, a former chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts and director of the Country Music Foundation who is the current Branscomb Scholar at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, thinks that the preservers of popular culture could benefit by making their scope even broader. 
"The same issues cut across broad range of cultural institutions, outside of just music," he said. "The Museum of Television and Radio in New York, the American Film Institute in Los Angeles -- they should all be brought into the mix. They are the caretakers of American popular culture heritage, and it's important for them to start talking to each other."

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE SCENES; 
Independent Curators: Have Art, Will Travel

BYLINE:  By MELISSA MILGROM 

 BODY:
FOR Jade Dellinger, working as an independent curator -- without formal ties to a single institution -- is a matter of freedom. "I'm interested in creating the most appropriate context" for a particular artist, he said, "without any particular allegiance to a museum or regard for the way institutions usually do things."
 When Peter Doroshenko became the founding director of the Institute of Visual Arts in Milwaukee, working with independent curators was a matter of necessity. How else could he attract -- or afford -- to bring in curators with their fingers on the pulse of the global contemporary art scene? 
 For Harold Koda, the director of the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in Manhattan, independent curators are a strategy. To curate, for example, a future exhibition on the Hollywood designer Gilbert Adrian, Mr. Koda chose Jane Trapnell Marino, a costume designer for films and television whose singular passion for Mr. Adrian's work has made her an authority on the subject. "It would be hubris for me to say I know more about Adrian than she does," Mr. Koda said. "I'd just be citing her work. Why don't I go to the expert?" 
These reasons and more -- including, not insignificantly, that this expertise comes at fairly low rates -- have whittled away at the notion that curators fit within museums as cozily as tenured professors fit into universities. In fact, Paul Schimmel, the chief curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, said at a symposium that recent developments had "blown apart" the standard American definition of what a curator is.
"The most important change in curatorial practice today," he said, is "the role of the independent curator -- a kind of journeyman curator or wandering global nomad" who does not have the shell of a museum for protection.
According to Amada Cruz, the director of the Center for Curatorial Studies at Bard College, curators often function like producers these days. As the mix of talents that are required to make a successful show have changed, curators are no longer judged solely by their scholarly background. Possibilities have opened for movement between fields. 
In Europe, the practice of hiring curators who are not contractually bound to an institution has been common for a while.
In the last decade or so, big American museums have begun to hire consultants to organize shows. The Museum of Modern Art's exhibition "High and Low" was co-curated by Adam Gopnik, a New Yorker magazine writer. "Jacqueline Kennedy: The White House Years" was curated by Hamish Bowles, an editor at Vogue, and the Brooklyn Art Museum's "Hip-Hop Nation: Roots, Rhymes and Rage" was curated by Kevin Powell, an authority on contemporary music.
WITHIN the top levels of museums, exhibitions by celebrity curators generate a buzz that keeps their profile high. Across the country, especially as the economic downturn has hit home, many smaller and midsize museums have found independently curated shows, many of them traveling exhibitions, increasingly attractive.
These factors have prompted big concerns over the rise of independent curators -- whether museums are opening up for the wrong reasons. After all, the backbone of every museum is its program and collection, critics say.
"Curators who are attached to institutions are the defenders of their mission," said Kirk Varnedoe, the former chief curator at the Museum of Modern Art, who has organized shows independently and as a staff member. "If they are relegated to doing grunt work because their institution has bought into these big coteries of floating art stars who go from biennial to art fair, that's an unhealthy sign." 
Mr. Doroshenko, the director of the Visual Arts Institute at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, shares some of these concerns, which is why he sought to combine the fresh views of outsiders with continuity. In lieu of a full-time staff, he hired an international team of floating adjuncts from Paris, Mexico City, Tijuana, Munich and San Juan, P.R. Their work will be folded into the institute's continuing mix rather than be engaged for a single show.
There is a danger to the approach, Mr. Doroshenko said. "A lot of my colleagues have noticed the success of my model and have begun hiring freelancers without benefits only to reduce costs," he said, "which I think is the biggest mistake in the world."
Other museums are taking half-steps into the independent-curating world. The Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, for instance, established a permanent, revolving position solely for outside curators, artists and scholars; the museum also built a warehouse annex that artists can freely dismantle to accommodate their work. Chicago's Museum of Contemporary Art has allowed its senior curator, Francesco Bonami, to organize outside shows independently. He was just appointed the 2003 director of the Venice Biennale, a title that will bring cachet and, hopefully, adventurous new ideas to the Chicago museum without the inherent risk and cost of staging an experimental show itself.
Another way museums fill in gaps is by renting traveling shows. Enter Independent Curators International, a nonprofit organization that for 26 years has sold entire exhibitions -- research, execution, shipping, catalog -- to leading museums. The shows are selected from proposals (most pitched by independent curators) and are chosen based on the ideas presented, regardless of financing. 
The organization recently staged "Lee Krasner" at the Brooklyn Museum of Art and "Beyond Preconceptions" at the National Gallery in Prague, a show that rents for 10 weeks for $15,000. The shows range from $7,500 to $30,000. 
Although the organization provides access to challenging or avant-garde work that a staff curator might not have known about, the surge in demand for traveling shows is more directly related to the state of the economy -- museums need inexpensive, provocative exhibitions. Traveling shows, in general, are far less expensive to stage than exhibitions that are organized in-house, said Carin Kuoni, the director of exhibitions at Independent Curators. While the company provides a complete package, she said, it encourages a museum's own curators to reshape the show by adding new works or by changing the context to suit their local community.
The attraction of being an independent curator depends on which end of the field is discussed. Hou Hanru, a leading independent curator from China, lives in Paris, is an adviser to the Rijksakademie van Beeldende Kunsten in Amsterdam and has curated more than 30 shows throughout the world. Okwui Enwezor, a Nigerian-born critic and poet based in New York, is this year's artistic director of Documenta, a show in Kassel, Germany, that has always signaled important changes in the art world.
TO prepare for Documenta, Mr. Enwezor traveled to the far-flung corners of the world -- Senegal, Malaysia, Mali, Nigeria, China, Jamaica, Mexico and elsewhere. And Hans-Ulrich Obrist, the curator for Musee d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, uses the museum as a base for collaborations with scientists, architects and other nonmuseum professionals that result in traveling exhibitions in places like airplanes and opera houses. A maverick with feet in both camps, he regards a museum as a time capsule and as a laboratory. "For me it's always working on the inside and the outside," he says. "If you are only flying in and flying out, the continuity doesn't develop." 
At the other end of the independent-curating field are people like David Pagel, a freelance art critic who writes for The Los Angeles Times. He works on a handful of shows each year. "The most I've ever gotten from a show is $5,000; it probably came out to 50 cents an hour," he said. "It's very seat-of-your-pants living." 
For Mr. Dellinger, another independent curator, the real payoff is freedom. With no desk to tend, he can travel in search of new artists. And with no fixed point of view to represent, he can "be more responsive to the needs and desires of artists with whom I choose to work," he said.
Mr. Dellinger thinks that it is helpful for museums to let in outsiders. "I strongly believe cross-pollination is critical for the survival of museums," he said. 
Not surprisingly, some of the greatest apprehension about the trend emanates from staff curators. Because they get a chance to stage only one show every two or three years, they may be understandably reluctant to give their slots away. "I don't bring in outside curators because I have so many ideas and so little time and space on the schedule," says Paola Antonelli, the curator for design and architecture at the Museum of Modern Art. "Frankly, I want to do it all.
"I collaborate a lot," Ms. Antonelli said, "but I like to be the director of the movie."

HEADLINE: After Years of Vamping, a Jazz Museum Gets Ready for Harlem 

BYLINE:  By LEONARD GARMENT; Leonard Garment, counsel to President Richard M. Nixon, is president of the National Jazz Museum. His memoir, "Crazy Rhythm," was recently released in paperback.

 BODY:
WATCH a jazz group gather on a bandstand. The pianist plays some introductory chords, then repeats them. The other musicians talk, joke, trade suggestions about tunes and tempo and play seemingly random riffs. Finally, to the relief of the audience, they begin. "Vamp till ready" is music-business jargon for this Zen-like ritual of marking time until performance overtakes preparation. The phrase applies just as well to the founding of a museum like the one in whose birth I am involved, the National Jazz Museum in Harlem.
 In 1995, Art D'Lugoff, who was closing the Village Gate, his historic Greenwich Village jazz club, suggested the idea of a jazz museum to his friend David Levy, who is director of the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, a sometime saxophonist and a lifelong jazz enthusiast. The two of them enlisted me. Before entering the practice of law, I had spent some time as a jazz musician; my performing career was brief, but my love of jazz proved permanent. Daryl Libow, a Washington lawyer and amateur jazz historian, joined us. We had lots of enthusiasm and no financing. We soon discovered the limitations of the former and the importance of the latter. 
 Some of our early decisions were easy. The most appropriate place for the museum was clearly Harlem, reflecting African-Americans' dominant contribution to the art form. The music in Harlem's clubs and theaters, during and after the Harlem Renaissance, indelibly shaped how jazz entered and informed virtually all American culture. A jazz museum in Harlem would be a companion to the jazz performance space being developed at Lincoln Center.
In those early days we also received some indispensable financial support. Through friends of mine who are involved in antipoverty efforts in Harlem, I met Deborah Wright, who was then the president of the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, Harlem's main development organization. The empowerment zone provided the jazz museum its first funds, a grant of $125,000. That money was matched by the Scheuer Foundation and by Abraham Sofaer, a State Department legal adviser, federal judge and jazz fan.
We had enough money to hire an executive director, who struggled for a year to assemble an organization. We gathered a distinguished board. Jazz historians, archivists, educators and musicians advised on museum structure, themes and exhibitions. We were assured access to the vast jazz collections of the Smithsonian Institution and the Library of Congress. We acquired the help of Wendy Evans Joseph, the architect of the new Women's Museum in Dallas. Design work began for a small experimental building, modeled on the Geffen Contemporary in Los Angeles, where we could test relationships among historic text, live music and technology.
But our inadequacies soon overtook us. To begin with, we were all part timers; our meetings were sporadic and our communications mainly by remote means. We groped to answer basic questions: Who would do preliminary organizing? How would we raise more money? Where would the museum be sited? More important, what was the museum's mission? How could it display and illuminate music, an invisible art form? We properly identified these issues but did not have the expertise to resolve them.
We flailed around for several years, and while we did, the money ran out. We had been awarded a $20,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Arts to be used for planning conferences; but first we needed several hundred thousand dollars to refine and develop our primitive planning. We did not have it. Our executive director departed, sensibly enough, for employment elsewhere. Work came to a halt.
Then in December 2000, Congress produced what it occasionally does: an act of creative generosity. I had tried to interest senators and representatives in the museum, and some responded -- notably, Senators Daniel P. Moynihan of New York and John Warner of Virginia and Representatives Charles B. Rangel of New York and John Conyers Jr. of Michigan. Most unexpected was the crucial concurrence of Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska, at that time the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. It turned out that Mr. Stevens was a jazz fan who, during his years at Harvard, had spent many weekends in the jazz clubs of Manhattan. You never know.
Congress provided $1 million for development of the museum. This kind of largess is not exactly drive-by financing. The money is earmarked within the budget of a federal agency -- in our case, the Small Business Administration -- whose standards the grantee must meet in exacting detail before the money is disbursed. The process pursued by Daryl Libow, with a litigator's tenacity, took us almost a year to complete. 
That is how the museum stayed alive. But the idea gained major impetus from another event, the accelerating momentum of change in Harlem. For years, a new Harlem Renaissance had struggled to be born; it was finally happening.
ON Feb. 10, The New York Times reported on "The Changing Look of the New Harlem." Parcel by parcel, it said, Harlem was finally being remade. The principal actors in this development drama were the empowerment zone and the state Metropolitan Economic Revitalization Fund. Though the organizations' names are less than poetic, the transformation they wrought was dramatic. Indeed, Harlem now faces a new problem: the displacement of small businesses through gentrification.
In this changed urban setting, the jazz museum returned to life like a rim shot. The president of the empowerment zone, Terry C. Lane, is supporting the jazz museum as a natural addition to Harlem's landmark Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, the expanding Studio Museum, the rebuilt Apollo Theater, a new Museum for African Art and other major cultural establishments. 
Discussions have begun that will allow the museum to have access to major jazz archives, like the Rutgers University archive administered by Dan Morgenstern, the director of the Institute of Jazz Studies there. The museum is also the natural home for a collection of which I am executor, Willis Conover's spectacular Voice of America collection of jazz music and history, which has 6,500 hours of performances and audiotaped interviews with the likes of Duke Ellington, Dizzy Gillespie, Louis Armstrong, Billie Holiday and Ella Fitzgerald. The National Endowment for the Arts has confirmed its planning grant to us; now we have the ability to use it.
Most important, we have a new executive director for the National Jazz Museum, Loren Schoenberg. Mr. Schoenberg has spent a quarter-century playing and conducting jazz, and he has had close associations with eminent musicians ranging from Benny Goodman to Wynton Marsalis. Mr. Marsalis, the artistic director of Jazz at Lincoln Center, has become a friend and supporter of the jazz museum. Mr. Schoenberg's extraordinary range is what we hope to see in the museum: an illumination of jazz as an art form, a teaching instrument, a model of combined discipline and improvisation and a supreme narrative, literary and musical, that has flowed through virtually every capillary of the nation's culture and set the mood for what we Americans think and feel about ourselves.
Much has been done, and more remains to be done, but we have finally reached the end of the beginning. We started with a big idea and no money, and the Harlem community was not ready for a jazz museum. These conditions have changed. So why, after seven years of vamping, is all this suddenly happening? Because, in the words of the 1945 breakthrough modern jazz recording by Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie, "Now's the time!"

HEADLINE: CALIFORNIA; 
San Francisco's Modern: In Search of Stability After a Storm

BYLINE:  By TESSA DeCARLO

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
WHAT does it take to make a museum great? In recent years, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art seemed to have all the right answers.
 Its glamorous new building was a favorite destination as soon as it opened in 1995. Exhibitions won critical raves and visitor numbers soared. Super-rich donors were happy to pay top dollar for acquisitions. David A. Ross, hired away from the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York to become director in 1998, further fanned local excitement and international buzz. 
 But more recently, question marks began to replace exclamation points. The collapse of California's high-technology boom put a squeeze on contributions. Morale sagged and staff members left. Last August, Mr. Ross suddenly resigned. 
Then came Sept. 11. Contributions shrank even further and the number of visitors -- heavily dependent on tourism -- dropped 15 percent. The museum appeared to be searching not only for a director but also for its way.
In many respects, its troubles are like those of art institutions around the country. "Museums fell into a trap in the 1990's, a very pleasant and comfortable trap," said Kent Logan. He and his wife, Vicki, have given some 300 works to the San Francisco museum, where she is a trustee.
"Times were good, benefactors felt generous, and name me one museum that didn't build a new building," Mr. Logan said. "Museums turned into big businesses, but they weren't managed like big businesses."
These days, however, benefactors are not willing to carry institutions that cannot stand on their own. "Museums have to break even," Mr. Logan said, "or close enough to satisfy their boards of trustees."
Locally, the museum's problems not only reflect those of smaller institutions but also affect them directly. "We're seeing a huge retrenchment in exhibition support," said John R. Killacky, the executive director of the publicly financed Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, across from the Museum of Modern Art on Third Street. "SFMOMA has to somehow keep its ambition going with fewer resources. But SFMOMA is the flagship. It's key to the vitality of the arts in San Francisco."
Which is why last month's announcement naming Neal Benezra as the museum's new director was greeted with relief by the arts community here. Currently a curator and deputy director at the Art Institute of Chicago, Mr. Benezra appears to offer everything the San Francisco museum needs: an outstanding art-world reputation, solid managerial skills and plenty of ambition.
"It's great news all around," said Kenneth Baker, the art critic of The San Francisco Chronicle. "There's an impression of rudderlessness one gets from that museum in the last year or more. Neal Benezra will quickly turn that around."
Elaine McKeon, the museum board's chairwoman, was almost giddy in her enthusiasm. "I've never had so many people phone me, send e-mails, even stop me on the street, all to say, 'It's a wonderful decision!' " she said.
While the good times lasted, the San Francisco Modern's rise was spectacular. The museum was founded in 1935 as the first on the West Coast devoted to modern art, but for more than 60 years it was a small-time venue housed in rented quarters on the fourth floor of the War Memorial Veterans Building.
John R. Lane, who became director in 1987, persuaded the museum's trustees to raise $63 million for a new building by the Swiss architect Mario Botta -- at 225,000 square feet one of the largest new art museums in the country. It was a gamble that paid off: the red-brick structure punctuated by a tower with black and white stripes became an instant landmark and inspired plans to take the less-than-stellar permanent collection to the same level of ambition.
The determination to become one of the world's top museums was likewise reflected in the board's decision to hire Mr. Ross after Mr. Lane left in 1997 to become head of the Dallas Museum of Art.
At the Whitney, Mr. Ross was known as a big spender who knew how to inspire art-world excitement, news media interest and generous gifts from the ultrarich. To locals and the global arts community, his arrival in San Francisco signaled that the San Francisco Modern had made it to the big time.
High-tech was pumping money into the Bay Area economy, and wealthy benefactors gladly helped the museum become one of the art world's biggest spenders, acquiring $140 million in art, most of it during Mr. Ross's tenure, ranging from modernist masterpieces to Web projects. 
As curator of painting and sculpture from 1993 to 2000, Gary Garrels helped arrange many of those acquisitions. "Most of the momentum had been building before David Ross arrived," said Mr. Garrels, who left to become chief curator of drawings at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. "He was the lucky surfer who grabbed onto this big wave, but it wasn't a wave that he created."
That wave soon crashed. In August, barely three years after he became director, Mr. Ross resigned. The museum's official statement said only that Mr. Ross's "priorities diverge from those of the museum."
The museum appeared to be doing well. Its 1998 Calder exhibition and the Magritte show in 2000 drew record crowds. In fiscal 2000, the museum welcomed 713,000 visitors, almost three times the number at the old building.
BUT the dot-com collapse brought the recession to the Bay Area early. Insiders said that trustees who were at first thrilled by Mr. Ross's spare-no-expense aggressiveness began to question his management style when the economy cooled. An internal "strategic plan" warned of "burnout and turnover of staff." 
"My approach was, and probably remains, too aggressive for this moment," Mr. Ross said in an interview. "With no apologies, that's who I am. It was a three-year honeymoon followed by a very quick divorce." 
Although The Chronicle called Mr. Ross's resignation 2001's "most unmourned departure," his absence left a vacuum. For example, the museum's current Eva Hesse retrospective, planned during Mr. Ross's tenure, is not receiving as much attention as many people had hoped. "The Hesse show is amazing," said Glen Helfand, a freelance critic. "But the energy around it is much more low-key. David Ross was a money drain, but he was also an energizer, and that loss is very apparent."
After the museum announced more than a dozen layoffs this spring, some feared that the trustees might pick an anti-Ross as their new leader, a bean counter whose only goal would be increasing revenue.
"The museum has to thrive financially," said Jeffrey Fraenkel, who owns a gallery in the city. "But if the director makes the bottom line the primary determinant of the exhibition schedule, that's when the institution suffers."
By appointing Mr. Benezra, the museum signaled that it was sticking to its high-art guns. Along with administrative experience, he has a strong academic record (a doctorate in art history from Stanford) and has been the curator for numerous shows, including retrospectives of Bruce Nauman, Martin Puryear and William Kentridge, favoring critical opinion over mass appeal.
"He knows how to balance art priorities against the bottom line," Mr. Fraenkel said.
Mr. Benezra, who grew up in the Bay Area and first learned about art in the cramped galleries of the old museum, acknowledges that popular shows have to be part of successful programming. But he also relishes the museum's loftier aspirations. "The fact that the museum has such strong ambitions for itself is one of the things that makes it so attractive," he said.
Despite the museum's recent troubles, Mr. Benezra will have plenty to work with when it comes to realizing those ambitions. Within the next five years, the museum plans to expand -- the building was designed to allow construction of nearly 100,000 square feet of additional gallery space -- and add a large sculpture garden on top of its parking garage next door. It is moving ahead with a 7,000-square-foot education center next to the permanent-collection galleries, to serve school groups and adult visitors, as well as expansion of its store.
The museum's endowment is a healthy $63 million, raised from within the museum's board, with an additional $12 million pledged so far. Then there's the trove of top-tier modern and contemporary art being stockpiled by local art lovers -- a rich source of possible future gifts. "I don't know if there's another community in the country, outside of New York, where you have the depth and commitment of the group in San Francisco," Mr. Garrels said. "And a lot of significant things have still gone into the Bay Area in the last 12 months."
Pam Kramlich, a museum trustee who, with her husband, Richard, is a leading collector of video art, agreed. "If everybody continues to support the museum -- and I think they will -- it will be in a very good position," she said.
The museum has also shown a knack for balancing crowd-pleasing shows with more challenging exhibitions. The recent Ansel Adams retrospective offered many little-known early works but still drew 375,000 visitors, Sept. 11 notwithstanding, and the Hesse retrospective has won raves while making the artist's often difficult work surprisingly accessible.
The audience has responded with real loyalty. The museum's membership, which is 42,000 -- 2,000 more than the Modern in New York -- has remained steady even during the last few difficult months.
"This museum wants to be great, and the community wants it to be great," Mr. Benezra said. "It has a wonderful future, a future I want to be part of."

HEADLINE: NEW YORK; 
New York's Showcases Are Facing Shortfalls

BYLINE:  By BERNARD STAMLER

 BODY:
VISITORS may not have noticed the signs of hard times at New York's two largest museums this last winter: a few more locked entrances at the American Museum of Natural History, a few more closed rooms at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
 Small measures like these were enough for the two museums -- strong institutions with big endowments and broad appeal -- to cope with a plunge in attendance of 50 percent or more in the months after the Sept. 11 attacks. 
 Attendance has risen since the winter, as fears of terrorism fade and the economy shows signs of new life. Weekends are often crowded at the museums, thanks primarily to local and suburban patrons and other day-trippers. 
But even as the museums seem to have escaped the worst, they have started to confront what they considered to be potentially more difficult choices posed by longer-term uncertainties. 
The long-distance tourists -- some of the museums' most ardent fans -- are still not back in town, at least not to the extent that they used to be. Overall attendance remains down at both museums by roughly 20 percent, officials say. The cash-short city -- which owns both museum buildings and is a major source of funds for both -- has already cut its financing by about $1.5 million apiece, with more cuts likely. Private donations have not returned to earlier levels.
In short, although "the trajectory and trends are in the right direction," the museums are still "a long way from home," said Ellen V. Futter, the president of the American Museum of Natural History.
After enjoying roughly five million annual visitors apiece in recent years, the museums are now welcoming around one million fewer visitors. That decrease, of course, has a direct impact on admission receipts, as well as on income from sources like restaurant and gift shop sales.
At the Museum of Natural History, those losses have translated into a decline in revenues of about $8.5 million as of March, said Ann Canty, a spokeswoman, who added that the shortfall might even go as high as $14 million or $15 million by June 30, the end of the museum's fiscal year. The museum has already cut its annual budget, to $119 million from an original figure of more than $130 million, and may have to do so again.
At the Met, which was running a slight deficit during its last fiscal year, the original budget of about $140 million has been cut by roughly $11 million; nevertheless, it still expects a possible deficit of $6 million to $9 million for its current fiscal year, which also ends in June, said Harold Holzer, a spokesman.
As a result of these shortfalls, cost-reducing measures have been imposed at both museums. At the Natural History museum, a number of entrances have been closed. The museum has also reduced opening hours, shutting down completely on Saturday nights and partly on Friday nights, according to Ms. Futter. There is also a freeze on hiring and on wages.
At the Met, Philippe de Montebello, the museum's director, ticked off similar measures that have been taken, though an official hiring freeze had not been imposed. Still, many positions that became vacant by attrition were not being filled. Galleries are occasionally closed when guards are sick or on vacation. Moreover, some large capital undertakings, like new designs for the Greek and Roman galleries, have been postponed six months to a year, he said.
NEW YORK's other museums were also hit hard after Sept. 11. But the degree of suffering has varied. At the Brooklyn Museum of Art, attendance is "pretty much back to normal" said Sally Williams, a spokeswoman. Such is the case for the New Museum for Contemporary Art in SoHo, according to its director, Lisa Phillips. At the Museum of Modern Art, attendance is actually exceeding expectations for the current fiscal year.
What explains the discrepancies? In Brooklyn, Ms. Williams explained, a new traveling Star Wars exhibition is garnering strong numbers; the museum is also "far less dependent on tourists" than its Manhattan counterparts, she said. The New Museum for Contemporary Art received what Ms. Phillips called an "extraordinary shot in the arm" from private donors, as well as from the Andrew Mellon Foundation, which donated $650,000, and the Carnegie Corporation of New York, which provided a grant of $100,000. (Reports have been circulating that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg anonymously donated $10 million for grants to New York City arts organizations that were distributed by Carnegie in February, though Carnegie officials will not confirm or deny this account.)
At the Modern, which is partly closed for renovations and which will shut down next month and move its operations to Queens in June for three years, three "very strong" shows are on display, said the director, Glenn D. Lowry, explaining the relatively good attendance. The strong shows include a retrospective by the German artist Gerhard Richter. 
Still, Mr. Lowry said, the number of visitors to the Modern, while above predictions, is actually lower than the number last year, when the entire museum was open.
But many other museums are still hurting. While that has resulted in big budget cuts, including layoffs and major exhibition cancelations and postponements at institutions like the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and the Whitney Museum of American Art, officials at the Met and the Museum of Natural History have decided, in the words of Mr. de Montebello, "to weather the storm."
At the Museum of Natural History, that philosophy has meant that a new show at the Rose Center, "The Search for Life: Are We Alone?" opened as scheduled last month. And "Baseball As America," a traveling show from the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., also opened in March.
At the Met, weathering the storm has meant continuing with its admissions policy -- pay what you want, so long as you pay something -- and forging ahead with its strong spring and summer exhibition schedule. This includes "Surrealism: Desire Unbound," "Orazio and Artemisia Gentileschi: Father and Daughter Painters in Baroque Italy" and the Thomas Eakins show, organized by the Philadelphia Museum of Art, which will arrive in June from the Musee d'Orsay in Paris.
Mr. de Montebello explained the rationale. "You may save money directly if you cancel an exhibition," he said. "But if you do, and all of a sudden you become a less dynamic institution, are you costing yourself what you save? Or are you shooting yourself in the foot?" After all, he added, "rivers flow to the sea and not to the desert."
For now, the strategy seems to be working, Mr. de Montebello said. But the Met's ability to hold the line in the long run will depend on New York's return to normalcy. 
Domestic and foreign travel to New York both remain down, according to figures compiled by NYC & Company, the city's tourism board. In 2000, 30.6 million domestic visitors arrived; the preliminary figure for 2001 is about 26.3 million. Domestic travel to the city is not expected to rise this year in any significant way.
Nor is tourism from overseas particularly encouraging. During 2000, 6.8 million people came to New York from abroad; during 2001, that number fell to about 5.7 million, according to tourism board estimates. The number of foreign tourists in New York this year is expected to increase only marginally, by fewer than 1 percent.
"There is a perception among some that ground zero is bigger than it is," said Christyne L. Nicholas, the president of NYC & Company, who has been traveling across the country to promote New York. Among others, like Japanese tourists, "there is also a belief that it is disrespectful to come to New York in a time of mourning," she added. "In the long term we are going to have to continue to be aggressive to get these travelers."
And while Sept. 11 looms large, there are other reasons for the shortage of visitors to New York City. The economy is still soft, and luring big conventions to the Javits Convention Center has gotten harder. The Javits center ranks only 19th in size in the nation, Ms. Nichols said.
Sooner or later, everyone expects things to return to normal. And in the meantime?
"You can generally last through one bad year," said Mr. de Montebello, adding that he was "cautiously optimistic."
"After that," he said, "if attendance is still down 20 percent, we'll be facing a lot of tough decisions."
Likewise at the Museum of Natural History. "We are watching this spring and looking at this summer very hard," Ms. Futter said. "We hope we won't have to cut anything more this year. But nothing has been declared exempt."

HEADLINE: Across the Nation, Galleries Refill 

BYLINE:  By BERNARD STAMLER

 BODY:
THE economic slowdown and the Sept. 11 attacks hurt museum attendance nationwide. But in most places, spring seems to be ushering in a return to normalcy.
 In Washington, tourism dropped sharply after the attack on the Pentagon, as it did in New York after the World Trade Center attacks. Attendance at the museums of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, including the National Air and Space Museum and the National Museum of Natural History, fell 35 to 45 percent in the months after the attack, said a museum spokeswoman, Linda St. Thomas. 
 The Smithsonian is financed largely by the federal government but it relies on operations like its museum stores, restaurants and theaters to cover various operating expenses. In February, estimating a shortfall of $8.6 million in its $60 million budget for the fiscal year ending in June, the Smithsonian laid off 45 employees.
Nevertheless, Ms. St. Thomas said, attendance appears to have returned to near normal.
That sentiment was echoed at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, which is also financed mostly by the government. The National Gallery also had a drop in attendance and a drop in income from its gift shop and restaurant. But, beginning in March, the galleries appeared to be full again, a spokeswoman, Deborah Ziska, said. Attendance, she added, now "appears to be back to normal." 
So it is in Boston, too, said Malcolm Rogers, the director of the Museum of Fine Arts, which owns its building and receives no financing from the city. The museum lost revenue when it dropped its admission charge during the last two weeks of September. ("It seemed like the right thing to do," Mr. Rogers said, as a way of offering solace to the public.) But now, he said, it is "fundamentally business as usual." Attendance this year will probably be about 1.2 million, on par with the last few years.
At the Art Institute of Chicago, "we were in a very unique position on Sept. 11," said Eileen Harakal, a museum spokeswoman. It was the members' opening for 'Van Gogh and Gauguin: The Studio of the South,' a blockbuster exhibition for which Chicago was the only United States showing. She said that although the show probably would have drawn more visitors had the terrorist attacks not occurred, nearly 700,000 people still came to see it from September to January, when it closed. As a result, museum attendance for this fiscal year, ending in June, will probably be about 1.7 million, Ms. Harakal said, compared with 1.3 million last fiscal year. 
The Los Angeles County Museum of Art has also recovered, a spokesman, Keith McKeown, said. "For about the first two weeks after Sept. 11, we saw a big drop-off," he said, "but then we were back to our usual level of admissions." 
The museum, which generally has 500,000 to 600,000 visitors annually, has been focusing its marketing eye on regions close to home to make up for a loss of tourists from Asia and other distant places. 
"Our admissions have not really dropped," Mr. McKeown said. "But they have changed in character." BERNARD STAMLER

HEADLINE: WINE TALK; 
A Bright Note in South Africa

BYLINE:  By Frank J. Prial

DATELINE: STELLENBOSCH, South Africa 

 BODY:
COMING back here after an absence of nine years is like meeting an old friend grown younger. The deep verdant valleys, the improbably beautiful mountains rising from the sea, the plants and flowers found nowhere else -- all rest immutable. But in and around them, one senses a new spirit, an eagerness to meet the world, not with defiance and resentment but with the pride that comes from building a new nation.
 Nowhere is this delight more evident than here in the wine country of the Western Cape. Indeed, wine could be taken as a metaphor for the new South Africa. Old-style wines, obsolete techniques and winemakers living in the past are being pushed aside, sometimes gently, sometimes abruptly, to make way for the new. 
 Under apartheid, the wine industry closed ranks, clinging to the old ways. "Foreign" grapes like chardonnay and pinot noir were banned. When they were grown in defiance of the law, their names could not be used to describe the wines made from them. Once, the principal South African white grape was chenin blanc, known here as steen. It is still the Cape's most widely planted variety. But today, it takes a back seat to chardonnays and sauvignon blancs, among the better South African wines. The Cape currently produces some of the finest sauvignon blancs in the world. 
In the past, pinotage, a cross between pinot noir and cinsault, an undistinguished French hot-climate grape, was South Africa's unique contribution to the world's wines. It still accounts for about 20 percent of the Cape's red wine production. But the new generation of winemakers are either tearing out pinotage vines or working to develop a new, more attractive pinotage-style wine.
In almost two weeks of visiting old acquaintances and meeting new winemakers, some of them sons and daughters of the men and women who were making wine here in grimmer times, I found remarkable optimism about the future, even though the country is suffering from serious unemployment -- officially 35 percent -- and a painfully weak currency. "The enthusiasm of these young people and the amount of experimentation going on is really astonishing," said John Platter, founder and for more than 15 years editor and publisher of the guide to South African wines that still bears his name. 
American consumers first experienced the new breed of South African wines with the arrival in the early 1990's of the sauvignon blancs of Mulderbosch Vineyards here in Stellenbosch, 30 miles east of Cape Town. The winemaker Mike Dubrovic still turns out his flinty, racy sauvignon blancs, but now he has stiff competition. I particularly liked the sauvignons of Andre van Rensburg at Vergelegen Estate, especially the Reserve from the Schaapenberg Vineyard. A few producers in the Loire Valley might compete with this wine, but no one else -- certainly not in California. Two other Cape wineries, Durbanville Hills and Neil Ellis, also produce sauvignon blancs I liked.
These wines should be able to lure some American enthusiasts away from chardonnay. But for those who refuse to be swayed, South Africa makes some intriguing versions. The best South African chardonnays manage brilliantly to combine French brightness and acidity with California's fruit. 
I particularly enjoyed a couple of chardonnays from the De Wetshof Estate in Robertson, a region once given over to raising race horses. Bateleur is Danie de Wet's best, but I preferred his more intense Chardonnay d'Honneur. The limestone soil that once gave horses strong bones does good things for chardonnay, too.
Springfield Estate, another Robertson winery, produces one of the more interesting wines I encountered here, a chardonnay called Methode Ancienne. If ever there was a white wine worthy of the "cult" designation, this is it. Night harvesting, no sulphur, almost three months of native yeast fermentation and a year in oak on the lees produce a chardonnay of monumental proportions. This is true, at least, when the winemakers are lucky; they successfully make Methode Ancienne only about one harvest in three. I'm not sure that any of it has yet reached the United States, but then it wouldn't be a cult wine if anyone could actually buy it, would it?
Other chardonnays worth seeking out that do show up in America include Rustenberg's Five Soldiers (named after trees in the vineyard), and wines from Hamilton Russell vineyards at Hermanus and Warwick Estate here in Stellenbosch. Delaire and De Wetshof both produce good unwooded chardonnays.
South African chenin blanc in the bad old days was for the most part a dull wine. Now, a few courageous vintners, mindful that chenin is also the grape of some glorious Vouvrays, are out to restore its reputation. Ken Forrester's unwooded dry chenin, along with semisweet versions from Mr. Forrester and from Morgenhof Estate, just might bring some respectability and a bit of lustre to poor chenin blanc.
Sparkling wines other than Champagne are often not worth the trouble it takes to open the bottle. South Africa's, the few sampled at least, turn out to be an unexpected treat. I especially liked Graham Beck's Brut, which is a 50-50 chardonnay/pinot noir blend, and two sparklers from Cabriere Estate: the Cuvee Belle Rose, a rose from pinot noir grapes, and the all-chardonnay blanc de blancs, which, I found, goes extremely well with Namibian oysters. None of these wines are going to knock Krug's Clos du Mesnil off its well-deserved pedestal, but they will give lots of lesser Champagnes serious competition. 
The best way to enjoy the Cabriere wines is at the Haute Cabriere Cellar Restaurant high on the Franschhoek Pass Road looking out over the spectacular Franschhoek Valley. The best way to enjoy the restaurant is in the company of Achim von Arnim, who makes the wines and owns the restaurant with Matthew Gordon, the chef. If Mr. von Arnim is in an expansive mood, which he usually is about 365 days a year, he will sabre open your bottle of his wine. If he is in a very expansive mood, he will show one of the women in your party how to do it. Try to get that kind of treatment in Champagne.

HEADLINE: FILM REVIEW; 
A Music Teacher Trims the Curriculum but Not Her Enthusiasm

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN HOLDEN 

 BODY:
Watching Anne Boyd -- the Australian composer, music professor and embattled heroine of the documentary film "Facing the Music" -- teach classes in composition, it is clear she is one of those rare teachers who changes the life of almost every student who crosses her path. Stout with short grayish-blond hair and a bluntly emphatic manner, Ms. Boyd metamorphoses from a dowdy middle-aged academic into a fire-breathing idealist whenever she talks about music. If an actor were to portray her on the screen, only one with the impassioned grandeur of a Vanessa Redgrave or Judi Dench could do her justice.
 Ms. Boyd is especially eloquent on the subject of Beethoven who, she says, believed artists to be society's ultimate elite. One of the more revealing stories she tells her students describes the divergent attitudes of Beethoven and Goethe when they encountered a group of aristocrats while taking a walk. Where Goethe was deferential, Beethoven, to his companion's chagrin, unceremoniously cut through the middle of the group as though he were the king. 
 Ms. Boyd may not put on royal airs, but her sympathies clearly lie with Beethoven. When she talks about music, God often appears in the same sentence, since great music, she insists, is a direct spiritual connection to the eternal. She can't help but lay her heart on the line. In one of the film's most touching scenes, she becomes so overwrought while helping a student improve a work in progress that she delivers a sermon that reduces the student to tears. After Ms. Boyd leaves the room, the student rips up her manuscript in despair, but a lesson has been taught; composing should be a do-or-die emotional commitment.
"Facing the Music" which opens today at Film Forum in Manhattan, was directed by Bob Connolly and Robin Anderson, the husband-and-wife team responsible for well-regarded documentaries like "First Contact" and "Rats in the Ranks." Since it was completed, Ms. Anderson died of cancer at 51. The movie was filmed while Ms. Boyd was chairman of the music department of the University of Sydney during a time of sharp financial cutbacks that threatened her department's integrity, if not its existence.
On the evidence of the classes, meetings and student performances the film observes, it is an outstanding department whose faculty members, energized by Ms. Boyd's commitment, give their all. As the cutbacks necessitate trims in the curriculum, her loyal staff follows her example by picking up the slack and teaching many more hours than contractual obligation requires.
But Ms. Boyd is no diplomat. She is the kind of stubborn true believer who can be a thorn in the bureaucracy's side, and she tends to play the self-martyring victim. Although her colleagues are willing to make sacrifices, there are limits to the responsibilities they are ready to assume.
Early in the movie, when the vast majority of the university faculty members are ready to strike to protest the cutbacks, Ms. Boyd is a holdout who insists that closing the university for even a day would be a tragedy. Eventually she changes her mind and once enlisted in the cause becomes an enthusiastic striker eager to persuade university suppliers not to cross picket lines.
"Facing the Music" often feels like two movies loosely sewn together. By far the most compelling of the two is its portrait of Ms. Boyd, a woman who for all her quirks and self-dramatizing flourishes, emerges as a noble spirit on the side of the angels. The other, more mundane movie, deals with the politics of university financing, the relationship between the faculty and the administration, and the underappreciation of the arts.
But as observers of an institution, the filmmakers lack the patience and thoroughness of a Frederick Wiseman. As effectively as "Facing the Music" conveys a sense of crisis, its detailing of the institutional nuts and bolts and the social, political and economic processes eroding the music department is sketchy and ultimately one-sided.

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE; 
A City Always on a Wave

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK 

DATELINE: HOUSTON 

 BODY:
Ask if this city is going through a bust and receive a classic Texas response: We've seen bigger.
 Memories of the mid-1980's, when the local economy ran dry, haunt Houston. 
In the late 1970's, Houston's office market benefited from economic factors that were hurting the rest of the country. The Arab oil embargo, the Iran hostage situation and a recession helped make oil drilling wildly profitable. Developers added 31 million square feet of office space from 1975 to 1979, and another 84.2 million from 1980 to 1984. 
 Then the banking and savings and loan industries collapsed; the top four bank failures were in Texas. The economy of Mexico, a large trading partner for Texas long before the North American Free Trade Agreement, collapsed around the same time. Oil prices fell. Vacancy rates ran as high as 35 percent.
The modern Houston economy is built on energy but it is supported by the medical and technology industries in the suburbs. By the end of 2001, there was roughly 56.6 million square feet of space in 198 buildings in the suburbs and 81.8 million square feet in 221 buildings over all, according to Trione & Gordon, a Houston brokerage firm. Suburban markets like the Westchase/Energy Corridor in West Houston and the Galleria near downtown have had significant development, and recently the central business district has received some interest. 
The first developer to start a downtown skyscraper since the 1980's was Hines Interests; the project was the Enron tower, as yet unfinished. MICHAEL BRICK

PERSON: Paul Grimes 

HEADLINE: Paul Grimes, 77, Travel Writer, Editor and Times Correspondent 

BYLINE:  By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Paul Grimes, a former editor, foreign correspondent and travel columnist for The New York Times, died yesterday in Abington, Pa. He was 77 and lived in Glenside, Pa.
 The cause was complications from hip surgery after a fall, his family said. He had been in failing health, undergoing both dialysis and chemotherapy. 
 Mr. Grimes originated and wrote the Practical Traveler column, a weekly collection of travel advice. He left The Times in 1987 to help establish Conde Nast Traveler, a magazine of which he was the founding news editor.
Mr. Grimes first wrote for The Times in 1955 as a stringer in Bangkok; he was then an editor at The Bangkok Post. He joined the staff of The Times in 1957 as a copy editor on the city desk. 
From 1959 to 1962 he was the Times correspondent in New Delhi, covering India, Pakistan and Afghanistan as well as the remote Himalayan kingdoms of Bhutan and Sikkim.
Mr. Grimes went to Bhutan in 1960 with the first group of reporters permitted to go there; his reporting was the first glimpse that many American readers had of that country.
"Urgent military and economic needs are catapulting the kingdom of Bhutan into the jeep age," he wrote, "but until a year ago most of its people had not even heard of the wheel."
In fact, roadwork for a paved access to the capital was barely under way, and the journalists spent the better part of 11 days riding mules to and from Paro in central Bhutan. Aside from their professional paraphernalia, they carried insect repellents and rock salt to fight off the leeches that infested dense forests.
After his return from Bhutan, Mr. Grimes recalled in an article for Times Talk, the house organ, that his mule, Nobjum, and he "never really trusted each other," and his saddle sores were only part of it:
"The real enemies were the drenching mountain rains and the leeches -- the millions of them that wriggled in the mule track and clung to bushes and trees, waiting for humans and mules whose blood they could suck. Fortunately I became the victim of only two."
Paul Mark Grimes was born on May 8, 1924, in Manhattan and grew up in Mount Vernon, N.Y. He interrupted his education to serve as a sergeant in the Army in Europe in World War II. He graduated from Cornell University in 1947 and worked as a reporter and copy editor for The Kansas City Star and Women's Wear Daily.
In 1950, he got a taste of Asia as an information officer for the United States government in Bombay. He returned to the United States for a job at The Providence Journal, then took the editing job in Bangkok. He was a copy editor at The Daily News until he got a full-time position at The Times in 1957. 
After his assignment in Asia, Mr. Grimes was an assistant to the foreign editor in New York but left in 1966 to become special projects editor and a foreign correspondent for the old Philadelphia Bulletin.
He started the Practical Traveler in The Times in 1977, writing it every other week. It drew an avid response from readers and became a weekly event within less than two years.
His book "The New York Times Practical Traveler" (Times Books, 1985) derived from the column.
At Conde Nast Traveler, he was news editor and then editor at large, a position he held until two years ago. 
Most recently he wrote a syndicated column on consumer travel issues.
Mr. Grimes is survived by his wife of 44 years, Miriam Blechman Grimes; three sons, Robert N. of Potomac, Md., Seth L. of Takoma Park, Md., and Joshua L. of Penn Valley, Pa.; a brother, Walter, of Arlington, Va.; and six grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Income Gap Widens Between Rich and Poor in 5 States and Narrows in 1 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 23 

 BODY:
The growth in income inequality over the last several decades was particularly pronounced in a handful of states, including New York and California, while the gap between rich and poor narrowed in only one, Alaska, a report released today by two liberal research groups found.
 Using Census Bureau data, the two groups, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and the Economic Policy Institute, looked at household incomes at the peak of each of the last three economic cycles -- in the late 1970's, the late 80's and the late 90's -- and found that gains in the top 20 percent of families during those periods outstripped those in the bottom 20 percent in 44 states. 
 In five states -- Arizona, California, New York, Ohio and Wyoming -- income among the bottom 20 percent of households actually fell in inflation-adjusted terms while it rose rapidly in the top 20 percent.
In New York, for example, average income in the bottom 20 percent of households fell $794, or 5.9 percent, over the 20 years, to $12,639. During the same period, average income among the top 20 percent of households rose $56,812, or 54.1 percent, to $161,858. That meant that by the late 1990's the average income of the top fifth of households in New York was nearly 13 times that of the lowest fifth, up from eight times as much 20 years earlier. 
In 39 states, average family income in the bottom 20 percent rose during the two decades, but at a slower pace than among the top 20 percent.
In four states -- Arkansas, Mississippi, South Carolina and South Dakota -- incomes at the top and bottom of the scale increased at about the same rates over the two decades. In Montana, average income did not change much at either the high or the low end of the scale. 
In Alaska, average annual income among the lowest 20 percent of households rose 22.5 percent over the 20 years, by $3,461, to $18,818. During the same period, income among the top 20 percent rose 8.7 percent, or $12,318, to $154,653.
"The year 2000 marked the final year of the longest recovery on record," said Jared Bernstein, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute. "Toward the end of the great 90's boom, we had very low unemployment and finally saw some long-awaited real gains for families at bottom of income scale. But it failed to reverse the growth of income inequality."
Elizabeth McNichol, the director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities' State Fiscal Project, said the figures were particularly important because they come at a time when states are under intense pressure to close budget gaps because of the weaker economy. She said states would be making important decisions about money for programs that have a direct impact on lower income families, including unemployment and health insurance, child care and transportation.
"State policy makers," Ms. McNichol said, "will make decisions that worsen the problem of increasing inequality or push back against the trend of increasing inequality."
Income inequality has long been an ideological flash point. Conservatives often play down the problem, noting that many people start out in lower income brackets when they are young, climb into higher brackets as they move into their prime earning years, and then fall back again when they retire.
But there is less and less debate between left and right about whether the phenomenon exists, although there remain vigorous differences of opinion about how to respond.
"I think they probably have a point that there is a growing distance between the top and the bottom, and a lot of that is policy driven," said William Beach, director of the center for data analysis at the Heritage Foundation, the conservative research group.
Mr. Beach said that while the tax system encourages wealth creation among people at the top of the income scale, it does little for people at the low end, especially when it comes to the biggest tax paid by most low-income people, the payroll tax that pays for Social Security.
Conservatives are strongly backing a push by the Bush administration to allow workers to invest a part of their Social Security taxes in stocks and bonds through personal accounts that they would own, a change they say would particularly benefit low income workers. Most liberals are strongly opposed.
The authors of the study by the liberal groups said there did not appear to be one specific characteristic that defined why states like New York and California saw a substantial increase in the gap between rich and poor. But they said there were some obvious reasons that applied to at least some of the five states where the trend was most pronounced.
They included the Wall Street boom of the 1990's in New York and the technology boom in California. Many of the states lost well-paid manufacturing jobs over the 20 years and saw a sharp rise in the number of relatively low-paid service sector jobs. There was an influx of immigrants into California, New York, Arizona and Ohio, many of whom filled low-paying jobs.

CORRECTION-DATE: April 25, 2002

 CORRECTION:
A headline yesterday about a study on income inequality misstated the number of states in which the gap between rich and poor has widened over the last two decades. As the article reported, it is 44 states, not 5. (In five states, income among the bottom 20 percent of households fell, in terms adjusted for inflation, while it rose rapidly in the top 20 percent.)

HEADLINE: Trade Center Plans Are Speeded Up After Criticism 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
State and city officials said yesterday that they had speeded up the timetable for the rebuilding of the World Trade Center site after recent criticism that the planning was moving too slowly.
 The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the trade center site, and the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, which is overseeing much of the downtown redevelopment, jointly issued a request for proposals for a design for the site, including space for offices, a hotel, retail stores and services, and an analysis of transportation projects. 
 A deadline of July 1 was set for initial plans, and a final proposal for the development of the site is due by Sept. 1, according to the timetable laid out yesterday. Final transportation plans and an urban design for the broader downtown area are to be completed by Dec. 1, the agencies said. Would-be planners must apply by May 6, less than two weeks away. 
In addition, a schedule for the development of a memorial to victims of the Sept. 11 disaster will be completed in July, the agencies said.
The faster timetable comes as Gov. George E. Pataki has come under intense criticism from Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democratic candidate for governor, over the seemingly slow pace of the rebuilding effort.
Mr. Pataki, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and officials of the Port Authority and the development corporation each issued statements yesterday praising the collaborative process among all the parties involved in the planning effort. Mr. Pataki said the joint effort would draw "on the best ideas and reflects our commitment to build the broadest consensus possible." Mr. Bloomberg called the request for proposals "an important step forward."
But in fact the planning has spawned intense bureaucratic rivalries over who is in charge of the redevelopment effort. 
Those rivalries were most evident two weeks ago when the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation issued a request for proposals for an urban planner to complete designs for the site and surrounding areas. Within days the request was withdrawn after Port Authority officials objected, saying they were not adequately consulted. 
On Friday the Port Authority issued its own call for plans. Although it was similar to the earlier one and was issued "in cooperation with the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation," it made clear that the Port Authority was driving the plans for the site.
The rivalries between the Port Authority and the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation became enough of an issue that the two agencies agreed to a memorandum of understanding laying out details of how they would work together, city and state officials said in their news release about the new timetable. 
The development corporation will basically solicit input from the public and from governmental agencies about the process and take the lead role in planning for a memorial. The Port Authority, meanwhile, will have more of a say over the trade center site.
City and state officials say that it is Mr. Pataki, increasingly, who is keeping a firm hand on the development process.
"Fairly recently the governor injected a sense of urgency into this," said one state official involved in the process, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "The governor said, 'Get this done; get the process going.' The R.F.P. is the response," he said, referring to the request for proposals announced yesterday.
Arguably, Mr. Pataki largely controls both agencies. He has filled seven of his eight appointments to the 16-member board of the development corporation, including that of the chairman, John C. Whitehead. In addition, Louis R. Tomson, the president and executive director of the corporation, is a longtime Pataki associate. 
Although Mr. Bloomberg also has eight appointees to the board, the development corporation itself is a subsidiary of the Empire State Development Corporation, the state urban development agency, which is led by Charles A. Gargano, a Pataki appointee. 
Also, roughly $19 billion of the $21.5 billion that President Bush has promised to New York for the rebuilding effort is expected to be channeled through Empire State Development rather than through the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation.
Mr. Pataki also jointly controls the Port Authority along with Gov. James E. McGreevey of New Jersey. Each governor appoints 6 of the 12 board members. But Mr. Gargano also serves as vice chairman of the Port Authority, and so far the New Jersey governor has participated little in public discussions about plans for the trade center site.
"It's no mystery who is driving the process," Robert D. Yaro, president of the Regional Plan Association, said yesterday at a planning conference sponsored by the Women's City Club of New York. "I've never seen a closer working relationship between the city and the state," he said, but because of Mr. Pataki's control of the Port Authority, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and Empire State Development, "Mr. Pataki is clearly driving the process." 
Mr. Pataki's request to speed up the planning process also extended to the memorial, where speed has drawn criticism from some. 
"I have concerns about the memorial process," Amanda Burden, chairwoman of the City Planning Commission, said yesterday, speaking to reporters after the Women's City Club conference. "Right now, the family members have no clear idea of what the process is, so their anxieties and concerns are totally understandable."

HEADLINE: Argentina's President Suffers Double Blow 

 BODY:
The Argentine government appeared to be unraveling after President Eduardo Duhalde's economy minister resigned and the Argentine Senate refused for a second day to consider highly unpopular legislation that would convert billions of dollars in bank deposits into low-interest, long-term bonds.
 The departing minister, Jorge Remes Lenicov, was one of the reluctant architects of the bond proposal, which is intended to brake the worst economic crisis in Argentina's modern history. Mr. 
Remes also faced fierce criticism within the governing Peronist party since his return empty-handed from negotiations in Washington over the weekend with the International Monetary Fund. 
 The abrupt departure of Mr. Remes, who worked closely with Mr. Duhalde for many years, raised doubts about the future of Argentina's efforts to obtain a rescue package from the monetary fund. 
Mr. Remes was the chief negotiator with the fund and other creditors, and the only senior member of the government to consistently argue that Argentina could not resolve its crisis without I.M.F. aid.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: MUSLIMS; 
How in a Little English Town Jihad Found Young Converts

BYLINE:  By AMY WALDMAN 

DATELINE: TIPTON, England 

 BODY:
The young men lived within a few blocks of one another in a Muslim pocket in this small town near Birmingham. They were out of school and often on the streets, in the occasional fight, sometime smokers of marijuana. They were, in the slang of the British Midlands, "dossers" -- slackers, layabouts. 
 So when they renounced the street for Islam, gave up their bad habits for prayer, their parents -- immigrants from Pakistan and Bangladesh -- were pleased. Neighbors were bemused: the drifters had found faith. 
 Last fall, four young men announced that they were leaving for Pakistan -- for a computer course, a holiday, an arranged marriage -- then disappeared. Their families had no word until January, when the Foreign Office called. Three of them -- Shafiq Rasul, Asif Iqbal and Ruhal Ahmed -- had been captured with the Taliban in Afghanistan and taken to Camp X-Ray in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. 
The fourth, Munir Ali, believed to have accompanied them into Afghanistan, is missing. 
No one knows precisely what drove them to Afghanistan -- whether they went to take up arms or offer aid. What is clear is that in Tipton, as across Britain, the seeds were there: a Muslim generation uncertain of its identity and prospects, angry at the treatment of Muslims the world over, and prey to recruitment, by individual journeymen and potent imagery, to militant Islam. 
The "Tipton Taliban" were just four young men in a corner of one small town in England. But their story is a window into the psychic journey being taken in immigrant communities across Western Europe as young Muslims are swept up by an orthodox, and often politicized, form of Islam far removed from the "Friday Prayers" version of their elders.
Some of the youths are stagnant or unemployed, others breezily successful. Either way, in a poignant kink in the immigrant arc, they have often deemed immaterial all the material comforts their parents emigrated for.
Today, the Taliban are fallen and Al Qaeda is, at least temporarily, in some disarray. The world's attention has shifted to another group of angry young Muslims -- the Palestinians battling Israel. Still, here in Britain, what one jihad champion calls the "nexus of politics and religion and frustration" remains unbroken. If anything, it has been fortified by events in the Middle East. 
These young men were ripe for being swept up. They lived a small-town ennui that could make trouble attractive because at least it made them feel alive. Asif Iqbal, 20, was hyper and excitable. He liked to test the limits. He had left school at 16, run with a wild crowd for a while, and blown a chance at college. 
He lived with both his Pakistani-born parents but often seemed on his own. His father, 68 and retired, was busy with leisure pursuits. His mother was uneducated and mentally a bit unwell. "He had no one to give him advice," a friend said.
He worked the night shift at an office postal service and spent most of his free time in the street, other than a Sunday afternoon soccer game. In 1999, he and a friend, also now in Camp X-Ray, had fought with other Asian youths in a nearby town, hurting one so badly he was left scarred.

A Refuge for Muslim Activists
When he turned toward Islam, then, Asif Iqbal did not do so in half-measures. What began as a mild curiosity soon became aggressive, even confrontational.
His path was already a well-trodden one. Britain has during the last two decades become a refuge unmatched in Europe for Muslim activists, scholars and clerics fleeing repressive governments in the Arab world or North Africa, and thus a center of Islamist influence.
Richard Reid, who tried to detonate a shoe-bomb on a trans-Atlantic flight, came to radical Islam at London's mosques; so did Zacharias Moussaoui, the only person charged in the Sept. 11 terror attacks. Djamel Beghal, accused of plotting an attack on the American Embassy in Paris, sought spiritual tutelage there. Ahmed Omar Sheikh, who is on trial in Pakistan accused of the kidnapping and murder of Daniel Pearl, grew up in Britain, the child of prosperous Pakistani parents. 
In all, no one knows how many of the newly radicalized have actually taken the journey from Britain to jihad. But over the last decade, members of the jihad movement say, hundreds have gone for training or fighting in Bosnia, Chechnya and Afghanistan. A document found by New York Times reporters at a Kabul house used by the Islamic militant group Harkat ul-Mujahedeen lists nine trainees, identified by code name, from Britain. 
Since Sept. 11, the presence of so many radicals, and a number of tantalizing, if ambiguous, terrorist links, have prompted other European nations to accuse Britain of being soft on terrorism.
Stung by the criticism and fearful that Britain will become a target for supporting America's war on terror, the government is using tough, even draconian, new laws to crack down on extremism. It is also trying to better understand why young men like Mr. Iqbal turn to militancy. 
The young men of Tipton are out of British hands, for now. Whether they will be tried here or in America, or simply go free, is unclear. For now, they pass their days in sunbaked cages in Camp X-Ray, far from the Midlands drizzle.

At Ease in Neither Land
Their families and friends have mostly put forward the same defense: the boys were too Westernized for fundamentalism to creep in. They were irreligious; they had to be prodded to mosque. They drank. They smoked. They went clubbing and chased girls.
Asif Iqbal preferred snooker and soccer to politics, his father told one newspaper. Shafiq Rasul's brothers said he wore Armani, as if that alone was impregnable armor against extremism. 
It is a disorienting image: Muslim immigrant parents defending their children on grounds of decadence.
But it hints at the forces pulling at this immigrant second generation, the first to be British raised. Their parents had brought their home country to their host country and so lived comfortably in both. Their sons seemed at ease in neither. 
Aziz ul-Hak, 22, was Asif Iqbal's best friend, and if, like most people here, he isn't terribly forthcoming about what happened, he is willing to talk a bit about his own "stressful" in-between life.
He speaks Bengali with his father and Birmingham English with his mates. His uniform is Nikes and a baseball cap, his wife a Bangladeshi his father picked. He does not feel particularly British, but in Bangladesh that's all he feels -- a rich Briton ripe for ripping off.
His father came from Bangladesh in 1963, part of a great migration of former imperial subjects from the Indian subcontinent invited to toil in Britain's factories. Many came here to the West Midlands, creating in Victoria Park Estate in Tipton a community that feels like a sari beneath a drab, gray English coat.

In Truth, a Place Apart
It is just six or so streets of linked plain prewar houses in neat uninterrupted rows. But behind the doors, the South Asian village culture survives, in the handmade chapatis, the parentally arranged marriages and the mildly intoxicating Bangladeshi leaf stored in a basket by the register at the Pakeeza grocery store. 
All this has made for the appearance of quirky cultural fusion. Pep's Park Lane Chippy serves curry sauce as well as fish and chips. Bollywood and Hollywood share space at the video store. Young Muslims study at the Roman Catholic school. 
But, in truth, the Park Estate is a place apart, a lace-curtained ghetto surrounded by the whites who make up 86 percent of Tipton's 50,000 residents. Around Tipton, young Asian men who wear Moschino jeans and gold earrings in one ear also hear themselves referred to as "Pakis." 
It cannot help that the entire economic basis of this world has fallen away. The factories are mostly closed now. Aziz ul-Hak thinks himself lucky to work at a food shop, since in Tipton many young Muslims do not work at all. More graduate to prison than university.
"The main thing with our teenagers is a drug problem, not a religious problem," says Bashrhan Khan, 34. 
Similar social strains among young South Asians prompted riots in some British towns last summer. Tipton's afflictions have been milder, but jarring nonetheless. A few years ago, gangs of young whites came through the Park Estate yanking off Muslim women's head scarfs.

The Pull Between Cultures
The Asians settled the score, sometimes violently, but felt personally betrayed by onetime schoolmates. Two years ago, the right-wing British National Party, whose Web site now features a "Campaign Against Islam," won 24 percent of the vote in a local election. 
This was the circumscribed stage on which the young men who disappeared were playing out their lives. They had left school at 16 and were living at home, two on the same street. 
Ruhal Ahmed, 20, was a takeaway worker and skilled kickboxer who felt the pull between cultures more acutely than most. A Bengali, he had fallen in love with a local Pakistani girl. In Tipton, this was not done. Parents picked partners back home. The Park Estate was too small to be disrupted by love. 
Shafiq Rasul, 24, was 6 foot 2 and model-handsome, by his brothers' reckoning. His father had come from India 35 years ago to work in a factory, and died four years ago. The son's purpose seemed less clear: shy Shafiq had dropped out of college or "taken some time off," and was working part time at an electronics store.
Munir Ali, 21, now missing, was also Bengali. Sweet and simple, he had struggled to find work, relying, as many young people here do, on temporary jobs. Before he left, he wasn't working at all.
As he searched for his place, his older sister had found hers -- unusual in a culture where women rarely work outside the home. She had won election to the local council, the first Asian woman to do so. 
After the news broke about her missing brother, she issued a statement: "We have grown up in Britain in a Western society. All members of our family share and respect British values."
Those values, like freedom of speech and human rights, have drawn Islamic dissidents seeking haven from repression at home. Some have used Britain as a base for influencing their home countries' politics, through writing, lobbying or fund-raising. 
But others are steadily kneading the identity crises of Britain's young South Asians, as well as converts like Richard Reid. These purveyors of radicalism single out moderate mosques, prisons and universities. Their foil is the West -- its actions, its policies, even the very freedoms they use to malign it.
On a Wednesday night in Luton, just north of London, 20 or so brown young men crowd into the Islamic Educational Center to hear the Syrian-born Sheik Omar Bakri Muhammad. Sons of Pakistani or Bangladeshi immigrants, most wear Western dress. 
"They want to keep calling us Pakis, bloody Arabs, brown Kaffirs," Mr. Bakri says. 
He caresses a bushy beard and conjures an imaginary character to dramatize a favorite theme: the futility of assimilation. "Abu Jabar changes his name to Bobby. He changes all his clothes. He dances. He raves with them. They still call him Paki." 
Bobby asks, "For God's sake who do I belong to?"
Mr. Bakri answers: "You belong to the Muslim umma, brothers. Come on in."
Mr. Bakri heads Al Muhajiroun, or The Emigrants, which he calls an Islamic ideological party. Some say he is all bombast and bluff, others that he manipulates young men into jihad. Whatever the truth, he indisputably transforms anomic young Muslims into Islamists.

Conjuring Up the Caliphate
His followers see recreating the caliphate -- the era of Islam's ascendancy after the death of Muhammad in the eighth century -- as the answer to Muslims', and the world's, problems. They often sound like nothing so much as young Marxists of another era. 
Islam "will guarantee every single individual the bare necessities of food, clothing, shelter," says Muhammed Ali, a 21-year-old information technology specialist of slight build and febrile mien.
In Britain, as everywhere, Islam has ribboned into countless sects and schools that often spend as much time attacking one another as attracting fresh recruits. 
The Birmingham Central Mosque is crowded with young people raised as indifferent Muslims who have now turned to a Taliban-style Islam that provides a way of life as much as a religion. The women cover not just their heads, but their faces; the long-bearded men no longer allow their children to be photographed. 
At the same time, many well-educated young Muslims have joined Hizb ut-Tahrir, a movement brought to England in the 1980's by Middle Eastern students. Its followers, who wear Western dress and often work in high-tech jobs, use anti-American propaganda to rally support for a pan-Islamic state. 
"Your Muslim brothers are suffering," they whisper to potential recruits.
The goal of the radicals, of whatever stripe, is to make Islam a political force. To do this, they employ a potent mix of vivid imagery, Koranic scholarship, hard facts and soft-boiled conspiracy theories -- the Jews attacked the World Trade Center to discredit Osama bin Laden; the C.I.A. did it to give America a way into Central Asia; Mr. bin Laden is an American agent meant to discredit Islam. 
All of this is passed along a Muslim information loop, a daisy chain of Web sites and word of mouth. Azzam.com, for example, features pictures of Iraqi babies malnourished because of American sanctions or videos of graphic slaughter by and of Muslims in Chechnya.
Imran Khan, 32, who publishes and sells pro-jihad literature, says that jihad recruitment is "more promising in smaller towns than larger towns."
"In smaller towns," he said, "there's nothing happening."

The Tales They Told
In the small town of Tipton, Shafiq Rasul told his family he was going to take a computer course in Pakistan. Asif Iqbal was going to carry out an arranged marriage, and Ruhal Ahmed was going to watch, or going on holiday, or making a religious pilgrimage -- no one, anymore, seems sure. 
As these stories have fallen away, parents and friends say the young men must have been brainwashed. They describe jihad recruiters and fiery visiting sheiks; Muslim door-to-door preachers and extremist mosques that influenced the young men. None of their theories are provable, but all are plausible.
With three mosques in four square blocks, the Park Estate was ripe for revival. Islam here has been parsed by denomination, language and culture -- all the divisions of the subcontinent. That variety well suited the Tipton youths' meanderings through faith. 
When they first turned to Islam, over idle talk at a local pool hall, their guides were moderates with mystical leanings. They borrowed tapes of Hamza Yusuf, a moderate American convert who has achieved a mass following in Britain and the United States. Their families immediately noticed a change. Asif's father was happy, he told friends -- his son had become a good religious boy. 
But, friends say, the boys soon migrated to an Islam of a more puritanical bent. They became judgmental, telling friends that they would see after they died how bad their clubbing and pubbing was.
They became convinced of their rightness. Asif once threw a punch because he could not win a theological argument in front of a group of friends. They argued against citations from classical scholars by saying they could interpret the Koran themselves -- they didn't need scholars. 
They challenged moderates in town to debate visitors like Sheik Abdullah el-Faisal, a Jamaican-born, Saudi-educated preacher who came to Tipton for two visits. He talked of the obligation to jihad, of Muslims killed in Bosnia.

A World of Conspiracies
Mr. Faisal sketched a world of conspiracies, of cabals of Jews and Freemasons plotting to take over the world. It was more exciting than Bollywood and Hollywood combined. It was real.
On some of his tapes, he speaks of why Muslims can never have peace with the "filthy Jews," and of Muslims' right to kill a Hindu if they encounter one in the road. In February, those tapes got him arrested and charged with "solicitation to murder," a charge he has said he will answer by showing that everything he said exists in the Koran. 
Asif and his friends were briefly taken with Mr. Faisal, but then moved on. They learned about Hizb ut-Tahrir, and attended lectures given by a recruiter for Al Muhajiroun. They argued that the Palestinians' conflict with Israel justified jihad. 
Then came Sept. 11. Muslims in Tipton, like those across Britain, were outraged by America's bombing of Afghanistan. Still, that the young men undertook their pilgrimage without parental permission shocked this tradition-bound community almost as much as their going at all. 
"They were supposed to ask their mother three times and their father once," one young woman said. 
But the literature of jihad has an answer to that. "Join the Caravan," considered a "classic" treatise of the Afghan jihad movement, states, "When Jihad becomes Fard Ain" -- an individual obligation -- "no permission of parents is required." 
All the young men needed was someone to make the argument that jihad had become Fard Ain. In Tipton and beyond, there was no shortage of people to make it.

HEADLINE: Census Shows Increase in Number of Hispanics Who Own Their Homes 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: MANASSAS PARK, Va., April 23 

 BODY:
Homeownership among Hispanics surged during the economic boom of the 1990's, but rates varied among Hispanic groups, census figures show.
 For example, 2000 census data to be released on Wednesday show that Cubans are more likely than Mexicans to own their own homes, while Puerto Ricans are much more likely to rent than to buy. 
 More flexible lending practices and the good economy helped increase the homeownership rate for Hispanics over all to a new high, though it still lagged far behind the national average for all people. 
The Hispanic rate grew to 46 percent in 2000 from 42 percent in 1990. Over all, 66 percent of American homes were owned by the occupants in 2000, up from 64 percent a decade earlier.
"There's no question there's a substantial increase in homeownership, but a very small base," said Roberto Suro, director of the nonpartisan Pew Hispanic Center research group.
By comparison, 46 percent of homes headed by blacks in 2000 were owned, along with 53 percent of Asian homes and 72 percent of white ones.
"Hispanic" is considered an ethnicity, not a race. People of Hispanic ethnicity can be of any race.
Owning a home is more prevalent in some Hispanic groups than others, and much of that is due to where these groups settle.
Mexicans, Puerto Ricans and Cubans are the three largest Hispanic groups in the United States. The majority of Cubans live in Florida, where housing prices and the cost of living are lower than in New York, which has a large Puerto Rican population.
Cubans, as a group, tend to be older, better educated and better paid, characteristics that lend themselves to homeownership. Cubans also tend to have been in the United States longer, giving them more time to build up enough wealth to buy a home. Much of the most recent Hispanic immigrant wave came from Mexico and Central America.
Those effects play out in the statistics: Of the three largest Hispanic groups in the United States, 58 percent of Cuban-headed homes nationwide were owned, compared with 48 percent of Mexican ones and 35 percent of Puerto Rican ones. In 1990, 51 percent of Cuban-headed homes were owned, compared with 47 percent of Mexican ones and 26 percent of Puerto Rican ones.
Erika Hizel, director of housing programs for the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic advocacy group, said Latin American families in this country tended to have little access to credit, largely because of their poorer backgrounds.

HEADLINE: Dot-Com Help, Wanted Again; 
High-Tech Casualties Assist Small Businesses After 9/11

BYLINE:  By ROBERT F. WORTH

 BODY:
Colleen Galvin never expected to work for a tailor. 
 But here she is in her black business suit, standing precariously on a battered sewing table and helping Luigi Barbato tape a temporary sign to the window of his second-floor tailor shop on Fulton Street, a block or so from ground zero. When the phone rings, she answers, covers the receiver with her palm, and whispers the client's name to Mr. Barbato, asking, "Will the pants be ready tomorrow?" 
 She is one of about 200 unemployed former dot-commers -- many of them with Ivy League business degrees -- who are helping some decidedly low-tech downtown businesses get back on their feet. 
Ms. Galvin and her fellow volunteers once spent their days among flat-panel monitors and booming stock options. Now they help struggling shop owners sort through the maze of emergency grants, teach them new marketing skills and, of course, burnish their own resumes for the post-Sept. 11 world. It is humbling work for people who once dreamed of getting rich in their 20's and 30's without ever dealing with a florist or a laundry except through their personal assistants. But the volunteers say it has exposed them to a world they never saw during the dot-com gold rush.
"I walk into a deli every day, but I had never thought about how that business works," said Valisha Graves, who worked for a dot-com that folded a year ago. Now she is helping Kevin Kim, who lost three of his 13 downtown delis on Sept. 11, to put his business back together by applying for grants, organizing an e-mail marketing campaign and finding companies willing to donate computers.
The volunteer program was conceived by the New York City Partnership, which is on Battery Park Plaza, just a few blocks from ground zero. "We saw a need to provide sophisticated expertise to hundreds of small businesses downtown," said Kathryn S. Wylde, the president of the partnership. "And we quickly recognized there was a network of people who could help, thanks to a combination of layoffs in the financial services industry and the demise of the dot-com industry."
With the help of a foundation called Silicon Alley Cares, the partnership signed up volunteers (not all of whom are former dot-com employees) to work as "business advocates" providing problem-solving assistance to downtown businesses. They had to commit to working 12 hours a week for three or four weeks at a minimum, but many have been volunteering virtually full-time for months. Altogether, 263 volunteers have helped 724 businesses, according to the partnership.
The volunteers are not solely motivated by charity. The program can be a way to erase what is seen by some as a stigma.
"As a recruiter, it's not a big plus on their resume" to have worked for a failed dot-com, said Russell S. Reynolds Jr., the chief executive of the Directorship Search Group, a head-hunting firm. "In that sense, these nonprofit efforts can be a great chance to show what you've got."
Jean Rosauer, a partnership volunteer whose startup folded in late September, said: "It's definitely an asset on your resume. That's not why I did it, but it helps build a connection -- otherwise I might look like anyone else." 
For the business owners, some of whom scarcely know how to use e-mail, the new help is a godsend. 
"Colleen opened my mind," said Mr. Barbato, whose tattered one-room tailor shop is still full of suits that were never picked up after Sept. 11. "My business is so small, always run the same way, but she knows marketing. For me, it is a big deal."
In many ways, the volunteers face business challenges they have never imagined before. Unlike the companies they generally worked for in the past, these small businesses had always worked with very little hedge against a bad year, much less a cataclysm. After Sept. 11, many were forced to reinvent themselves from scratch. "In some ways it's scary, in other ways it's amazing," said Clark Swain, who has helped find grants for a number of downtown businesses. "You're sitting down with people who keep books that are nothing more than a checkbook. The fortitude these businesses have in facing this situation is incredible."
One of the firms that Mr. Swain helped, P. Wolfe Consulting, was on the 22nd floor of the north tower. All nine employees of the architectural firm survived the attack, but the only possession they kept was a laptop someone had left at home. Within days, the staff met at a coffee shop and chose a plan to reconstitute the company.
Much of what goes into a young dot-com is fund-raising. So the agonizing process of trying to get emergency assistance from government agencies, companies and charities was a cinch for the volunteers.
Thanks in large part to volunteers' help, P. Wolfe was able to rent and supply a new office with donated furniture, and it lost no clients, said Panos Lupassakis, the firm's principal. Mr. Swain and volunteers from the partnership helped re-establish the firm's computer networks and secured grants for it, and now it has four more employees than it had before Sept. 11.
The smallest businesses have generally been hit hardest. Mr. Barbato managed to get back to his shop, Ann Street Tailoring, in December. But in addition to the 32 clients who died in the towers, more than half the remaining customers have disappeared, he said, perhaps because they thought he had. He said he felt that he must reach out to new customers quickly, and that Web-savvy people like Ms. Galvin could teach him how to use e-mail to do so. She also helped get Liz Claiborne to donate four new sewing machines.
Lucas Liu, who helped run a software company before Sept. 11, has been helping Flower World, a corporate florist a block from the trade center site, to line up charities and companies that may be able to donate hardware and legal services. "Some clients went out of business owing me money," said Len Kaufman, who owns Flower World. "No one is paying me anything, but all of my debts are coming due."
Andrew Rasiej, the co-founder of Silicon Alley Cares, said the dot-commers' technical savvy had made them especially valuable in the recovery downtown. But he also said the Web community's response to Sept. 11 could change its public image. "It will go far to dispel the notion that people from the dot-com sector are only interested in making money," he said.
Of course, one has to wonder where these volunteers would be had Silicon Alley not collapsed. "This program seeks to get some productive use out of a business disaster," Representative Jerrold L. Nadler said. "But it's a very good thing that these peoples' talents are being used to good effect before they've had a chance to re-establish themselves."
Several volunteers said they were considering careers in the nonprofit world for the first time. And it has given them a new perspective on the dot-com era. Ms. Galvin, whose old office was down the block from Mr. Barbato's shop, said, "It's the same place, but it feels like a lifetime ago."

HEADLINE: SCANDALS IN THE CHURCH: THE MONEY; 
Fear About Fund-Raising in Boston Area

BYLINE:  By FOX BUTTERFIELD and PAM BELLUCK 

DATELINE: BOSTON, April 23 

 BODY:
It had become the social event of the year, the annual garden party at Cardinal Bernard F. Law's residence to raise money for Catholic Charities, the largest private social service agency in Massachusetts. 
 Cardinal Law would sit under a tent, and hundreds of Boston's wealthiest and most influential people would stand in line for hours to have their picture taken with him. 
 Not this year. Last month, Catholic Charities canceled the party, which had been scheduled for early June, after some affluent donors wrote to say, "Are you crazy?" said Maureen March, a spokesman for the charity. 
"There is just such an understandable anger out there toward the church hierarchy" over the sexual abuse scandal, Ms. March said. "And people feel the only way they have to express it is to stop giving money." 
The cancellation is the most visible sign of the financial crisis that has grown over recent weeks as the Boston Archdiocese struggles with the fallout from the scandal.
Although dioceses in Baltimore, Dallas, Los Angeles, New Orleans, New York and Palm Beach, Fla., have had sex scandals, church officials and philanthropy experts say the financial repercussions have not been as serious in those cities as they are here. 
Here, the scandal has caused three local foundations and corporations that had been major donors to Catholic Charities to reject proposals for $800,000 in grants in the last three weeks. One grant had been planned for a community center in a housing project. 
Corporations and foundations "are even more sensitive to what's in the air than individuals," the president of Catholic Charities in Boston, Joseph Doolin, said. "When there is a problem in an institution, they tend to be rather skittish and err on the side of caution. So they don't make grants."
At the parish level, people have begun withdrawing their pledges to Cardinal Law's $300 million capital campaign, the largest ever by a Catholic Church group in the United States. 
At the Our Lady of Sorrows church in Sharon, a suburb, the Rev. Robert Bullock said 10 donors had canceled a total of $110,000 in pledges in the last two weeks, after the disclosure of church documents that showed how Cardinal Law and his assistants moved a priest accused of pedophilia to California and New York without informing those church officials.
Altogether, 313 people have withdrawn a total of almost $1.5 million in pledges, most of that since mid-March, said Kenneth Hokenson, director of development for the archdiocese. That is a fraction of the $173 million that has been pledged. 
In another change that would have been unthinkable a few months ago, some wealthy donors said they would continue to give to Catholic causes separate from the archdiocese, but not to anything run by the archdiocese, because they are not confident in the archdiocese's assertions that the money will not be used to settle suits against pedophile priests. 
The suits may total $100 million here.
"People are going to hold back, because I think what you have now is confusion" about where the money is going, said Joseph O'Donnell, chairman of Boston Concessions Group and a supporter of Cardinal Law. "People are going to vote with their wallets. I wouldn't write a check unless I knew where it was going."
In addition, church officials said another important campaign, the Cardinal's Annual Appeal in May, which pays for archdiocesan operating costs -- everything from seminaries to boiler repairs -- might fall up to 50 percent short of its goal.
"If they have a bad year, there are going to be tremendous ramifications for schools, social service programs and hospitals," said Jack Dunn, a former vice president of Catholic Charities who is a spokesman for Boston College. "These agencies are so lean they can't afford a fallback."
The appeal's problems are complicated by its close identification with Cardinal Law. 
"Because the cardinal's appeal is called the cardinal's appeal, it calls much more attention to Cardinal Law," said Msgr. Paul V. Garrity, pastor of St. Mary's church in Lynn. "Unfortunately, it makes the connection to the cardinal so tight that it almost invites people to respond in an economic way."
Parish priests around Boston said Sunday donations had generally been less affected because parishioners still felt great loyalty to their own churches. 
But the Rev. Walter Cuenin of Our Lady Help of Christians Parish in Newton, said that this past Sunday, for the first time, a few parishioners declined to give because of the scandal. 
Father Cuenin said, "There were four envelopes from four different parishioners with a little note saying that until the cardinal resigns they will no longer give to anything, even our parish."
Reluctance to support the archdiocese is so strong that an alternative fund-raising campaign is being planned by a new group, the Voice of the Faithful, a group that seeks greater lay influence in the church.
The organization, headed by Dr. James Muller, a founder of International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985, is planning ways for people to donate directly to Catholic causes, bypassing the archdiocese.
A leader of the group, James E. Post, said, "People are saying, 'We don't want to put money into a moral rat hole that is going to be siphoned off for legal fees, public relations, spin control for more secrecy and deceiving people." 
Insurance will cover a fraction of the settlements in lawsuits, church officials have said, and the church will have to take out loans, sell real estate or raise money through a special solicitation by Cardinal Law, which is under way. 
Nationally, donations to other Catholic charities are not down, said John Keightley, vice president for development and communications of Catholic Charities, U.S.A. 
But Francis J. Butler, president of Foundations and Donors Interested in Catholic Activities in Washington, a group of 47 family foundations that supports Catholic causes, said the crises had sent ripples of concern through its members.
"I think everybody's been affected by what's taken place," Dr. Butler said.
Some members are checking carefully to find out where the money to settle lawsuits is coming from, he said. Dr. Butler added that he was most concerned that the scandal would have longer term effects on the younger members of foundation families, people who are just beginning to become involved in foundations and are also the most disenchanted.
Catholic Charities here is projecting a $1.4 million deficit this year, equal to the sum that it raised at the cardinal's garden party last year, and it is laying off 170 of its 1,400 employees, mostly workers in food pantries, shelters for the homeless and drug-abuse programs, officials said. Apart from the scandal, the financial problems of Catholic Charities are compounded by the state's failure to finance fully several programs that it contracts the agency to operate.
"This is killing us," Ms. March said. "When we get angry letters, I try to say, 'I understand.' But I also try to tell donors that we help 173,000 people, 1 out of 10 people in Massachusetts, and these are poor, needy people who have nowhere else to turn to. They can't wait till all this anger blows over."
More than any other action, the cancellation of Cardinal Law's garden party has drawn attention. 
"When they had to cancel the garden party, that was not just a straw in the wind," said the Rev. Richard McBrien, a theology professor at the University of Notre Dame. "It was a rooftop whizzing by in a tornado."

HEADLINE: 2 Blows to Argentine President: Economy Minister Quits and Senate Balks at Crisis Bill 

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, April 23 

 BODY:
President Eduardo Duhalde's government appeared to be unraveling today after his economy minister resigned and the Argentine Senate refused for a second day to consider highly unpopular legislation that would convert billions of dollars in bank deposits into low-interest, long-term bonds.
 The departing minister, Jorge Remes Lenicov, was one of the reluctant architects of the bond proposal, which is intended to brake the worst economic crisis in the country's modern history. He also faced fierce criticism within the governing Peronist party since returning empty-handed from negotiations in Washington over the weekend with the International Monetary Fund. 
 The abrupt departure of Mr. Remes, the president's chief economic adviser, who worked closely with Mr. Duhalde for many years, raised doubts about the future of Argentina's efforts to obtain an emergency rescue package from the monetary fund. 
Mr. Remes was the chief negotiator with the fund and other creditors, and the only senior member of the government to consistently argue that Argentina could not resolve its crisis without I.M.F. aid.
At a news conference on Monday, Mr. Duhalde maintained that an accord with the fund was "not the only solution, just the one that is least painful." 
He described the fund's insistence that Argentina allow the peso's exchange value in dollars to fluctuate as "a mistaken demand" that had fueled inflation, and he said he also wondered if "some of the other demands they have aren't going to be harmful."
Mr. Remes issued no statement this afternoon to explain his decision to step down, and there was no immediate announcement of a successor.
Local news reports, though, said the job had been offered, first to Alieto Guadagni, who is the current energy secretary and served in earlier Peronist governments as minister of industry and commerce, and then to Javier Gonzalez Fraga, a former central bank president.
The sudden worsening of Argentina's five-month-old crisis began late on Friday, when the government decreed an indefinite bank holiday to prevent people from withdrawing money from the country's beleaguered banking system or exchanging pesos for foreign currency.
That was followed on Monday by Mr. Duhalde's politically explosive proposal to forcibly convert an estimated $12.5 billion of certificates of deposit into low-interest bonds.
"This is nothing more than the illegitimate confiscation of our money," said Reynerio Fernandez, one of several hundred demonstrators protesting the bond plan outside Congress this morning. 
"This is a government already in default on billions of dollars in debt," Mr. Fernandez said, "so who is going to believe that any piece of paper with their name on it has any value at all?"
But Mr. Duhalde has staked his future on passage of the legislation, which also includes the formation of a new government-backed Federal Bank and a formula to determine monthly increases in payments of mortgages and other credits. 
"If the Parliament is not in agreement, it will have to elect another president," he said at the news conference on Monday.
Mr. Duhalde clearly was counting on Congress to back away from a confrontation because, as he put it on Monday, "it is to no one's advantage that I go." 
On Monday night the Central Bank upped the ante by saying the bank holiday and foreign exchange freeze, which have brought economic activity to a standstill, would continue until the bond legislation was approved.
But his implied threat that rejection of the bill would lead to chaos and a political vacuum offended legislators, including members of his own Peronist party, who recognize that passage of the measure could mean political suicide. 
"Saying the banks will remain closed until Congress votes is an unacceptable form of blackmail," Senator Juan Carlos Passo, an influential member of the opposition Radical Party, said today.
As Mr. Duhalde met with political leaders throughout the day, signs of renewed unrest here and elsewhere in the country were growing. 
In mid-December a series of street demonstrations and food riots left 27 people dead and set off two weeks of political chaos in which the country had five presidents, culminating in Mr. Duhalde's election by Congress on Jan. 1.
Today in Mr. Duhalde's hometown, Lomas de Zamora, an estimated 1,000 people marched to demand that the government give them food. 
The lower house of Congress postponed its scheduled session after a bomb threat, and pickets blocked an important highway outside the northeastern city of Santa Fe. In San Juan in the west, the police used rubber bullets to disperse protesters demanding payment of salaries and pensions that are long past due.
Increasingly it appears that Mr. Duhalde's political future now lies in the hands of the 24 provincial governors, especially the 14 who belong, like him, to the Peronist party. Mr. Duhalde met this morning with Carlos Reutemann, the former race car driver who is now governor of Santa Fe Province and a Peronist power broker, and was to meet tonight with the others, who were rushing here from their respective capitals.
In December, Mr. Duhalde's immediate predecessor, Adolfo Rodriguez Saa, resigned after only a week in office after all but a handful of governors failed to attend a similar meeting. 
"Now, as then, the real power in this country is in the hands of the governors, not the president," a South American diplomat said this evening.
Mr. Remes and especially his efforts to negotiate an accord with the monetary fund have been unpopular with the governors, who have repeatedly been called on by the fund to cut spending as a condition for new loans. 
"The provinces and fiscal policy have to be part of the solution from the outset," Horst Kohler, managing director of the fund, insisted in Washington on Saturday after meetings with Mr. Remes.
But the governors have argued that the cutbacks demanded by the fund would aggravate the country's economic crisis by forcing the firing of as many as 450,000 government employees, and Mr. Duhalde has expressed sympathy for their position. 
"The governors are doing what they can," the president said on Saturday, adding that the main problem "is not that a lot is being spent in the provinces, but that people have stopped paying taxes as a result of the crisis."

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE; 
With Enron'sCollapse, Houston Has Lots of Space

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK 

DATELINE: HOUSTON 

 BODY:
A taxi driver is sure the building's name will be Duke Energy. The president of a real estate company concurs. The local newspaper said yes; that or Dynegy. Various bankers and brokers said it would be foolish to count out Reliant or Halliburton.
 Flashing a photo of a 40-story tower on the screen during a real estate conference, Laura Van Ness, the director for business development programs at the Houston Downtown Management District, said: "This slide used to say 'Enron Center.' It doesn't any more." 
 Her audience stared at the photo of the building, across the street from Enron's headquarters, and Ms. Van Ness nervously joked about what she might have written on the slide. "Enron Center South," she said, "or The 'Your Name Here' Building." 
The building, nearing completion, is a reminder that the pain caused by the Enron implosion can ripple far beyond its initial victims. Other building plans have been slowed or shelved, and downtown businesses are finding themselves with fewer customers. 
Reacting to the looming presence of an office tower that needs to be filled and to Houston's rising vacancy rate in Class A buildings -- generally the best-equipped and best-situated -- plans for other offices have been slowed or shelved. 
The Smith Street Land Company, an Enron subsidiary that, like its parent, has filed for bankruptcy protection, broke ground for the second Enron tower in July 1999, when Enron shares traded above $40. The next April, when Enron shares were more than $60, a contractor poured 11,000 cubic yards of concrete into 1,200 tons of reinforcing steel in a nonstop flow that lasted 16 hours.
On that foundation, the development firm Hines Interests built a reflective oval skyscraper tailored to the expected needs of an energy trading company enamored of technology. It is 1.2 million square feet and the top 33 floors are office space. It holds four trading floors, each 55,000 square feet. In the bottom few stories, intended to accommodate retail space, an auditorium and a food court, unfinished walls and construction equipment are visible. The building is almost done.
But around the building, economic growth has stopped. Plans for three million to five million square feet of construction are now stalled, said Barton Smith, director of the Institute for Regional Forecasting at the University of Houston. Rene Joubert, a managing director of the investment bank NorthMarq Capital, put it more bluntly: "It's causing everyone to be paralyzed."
More space has come onto the market at once than any time since the city's bust in the early 1980's. Economists and real estate market analysts expect vacancy rates downtown to rise to the high teens in the next year or so from 8.87 percent at the end of last year. They have already reached 12.5 percent downtown and 15.2 percent over all, including 15.9 percent in the suburbs, by the end of March, according to CoStar Realty Information, which tracks market data.
Downtown is not Houston but it is an important part. There is little land left for development along the freeways, which are clogged with traffic, and Houston has committed itself to myriad projects to force the geographic center of the sprawling city to become the city's center.
"It's very important that that building be occupied," said Carol Alvardo, a city council member representing downtown.
Enron is using 20 floors of its 50-story headquarters, built in 1983, and it has withdrawn from 790,000 square feet of space in four other buildings downtown, returning the space to TrizecHahn, a real estate management company. Enron's leases on the space were set to end as the company moved into its new tower, which it had expected to do this year.
The company signed leases in 1994 and 1995 on about 300,000 square feet in the three-building Allen Center at $13 to $15 a square foot annually. Those leases were through 2005, but Enron had informed TrizecHahn a few years ago that it planned to exercise a termination option on Dec. 1, 2002.
Enron had rented the rest of the space at higher rates in the intervening years, including 200,000 square feet rented 18 months ago.
Some of the space has been rented to others. Paul Layne, a senior vice president of TrizecHahn, said he had signed leases or letters of intent on 350,000 square feet of the 790,000 that was returned. "Because we got these back first, before other downtown space was available, there has been this pent-up demand," he said. Mr. Layne declined to say what rent the space had brought, but said the rate in the area was generally $25 to $27 a square foot. 
Demand for downtown space is expected to remain weak. The downtown market is supported by energy trading companies, a group whose financial books are under increasing scrutiny. Another pillar is Continental Airlines, which announced 12,000 job cuts after Sept. 11, although it achieved many of those with furloughs and early retirements. And Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm facing criminal prosecution and civil lawsuits related to Enron, is a major tenant of Pennzoil Place, with twin 36-story towers that have about 1.4 million square feet of leasable space.
"Unless things change, we're going to have a lot of space on the market," said Art Baylis, a managing partner of the real estate advisory firm Strategis, which represents tenants like Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers.
Aside from the Enron tower, there are three other office buildings under construction downtown. One is Calpine Center, a $109 million project started last year with 689,000 square feet spread on 32 floors. Calpine, the sole committed tenant so far with 300,000 square feet, restated its profits and had its debt rating reduced sharply last month. Five Houston Center is rising downtown with 27 stories of office space and no anchor tenant, as is a new home for Reliant Resources, the unregulated-business division of Reliant Energy.
William E. King, a partner in the law firm of Linebarger, Goggan, Blair, Pena & Sampson, started looking to move the firm's Houston offices a year ago but was put off by the cost. Things have changed, Mr. King said. "I get calls every day from brokers looking to make a deal. I attribute it to Enron."
Jim Robinson, the chief appraiser for Harris County, said the market value of the county's 47,475 commercial buildings would increase 6.6 percent this year, while the value of commercial property in the city would rise 5.7 percent. "Obviously there's some softness downtown," he said.
Political leaders and civic boosters have put a lot of time and effort into attracting companies, by building a stadium and convention center, tearing up the streets and starting a light rail project. They point to these as among the attractions that should prompt some other company to put its name on what was to have been the new Enron tower.
"All you've got to do is take the signs down, change a little something on the front and you're good to go," said State Representative Garnet F. Coleman, a Democrat. "By no means has this created a hole in Houston that cannot be filled. New York's still there, and they had two buildings blown up. We just lost a company."
